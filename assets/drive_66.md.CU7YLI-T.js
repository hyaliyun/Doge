In this acid, the S(VI) center adopts its characteristic tetrahedral geometry; the connectivity is indicated by the formula HO‚ÄìO‚ÄìS(O)2‚ÄìOH. It is one of the strongest oxidants known (E0 = +2.51 V) and is highly explosive. H2SO5 is sometimes confused with H2S2O8, known as peroxydisulfuric acid. The disulfuric acid, which appears to be more widely used as its alkali metal salts, has the structure HO‚ÄìS(O)2‚ÄìO‚ÄìO‚ÄìS(O)2‚ÄìOH. History H2SO5 was first described in 1898 by Heinrich Caro, after whom it is named. Synthesis and production The laboratory scale preparation of Caro's acid involves the combination of chlorosulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. ::H2O2 \\\\+ ClSO2OH ‚áå H2SO5 \\\\+ HCl Published patents include more than one reaction for preparation of Caro's acid, usually as an intermediate for the production of potassium monopersulfate (PMPS), a bleaching and oxidizing agent. One patent for production of Caro's acid for this purpose gives the following reaction: ::H2O2 \\\\+ H2SO4 ‚áå H2SO5 \\\\+ H2O Uses in industry H2SO5 has been used for a variety of disinfectant and cleaning applications, e.g., swimming pool treatment and denture cleaning. Alkali metal salts of H2SO5 show promise for the delignification of wood. It is also used in laboratories as a last resort in removing organic materials since H2SO5 can fully oxidize any organic materials. Ammonium, sodium, and potassium salts of H2SO5 are used in the plastic industry as polymerization initiators, etchants, desizing agents, soil conditioner, and for decolorizing and deodorizing oils. Potassium peroxymonosulfate, KHSO5, is the potassium acid salt of peroxymonosulfuric acid. It is widely used as an oxidizing agent. Hazards Pure Caro's acid is highly explosive. Explosions have been reported at Brown University and Sun Oil. As with all strong oxidizing agents, peroxysulfuric acid should be kept away from organic compounds such as ethers and ketones because of its ability to peroxidize these compounds, creating highly unstable molecules such as acetone peroxide.

History The Oettingen family was first mentioned in 1147 with Ludovicus comes de Otingen, a relative of the Imperial House of Hohenstaufen who was granted the county surrounding the Imperial city of N√∂rdlingen as a fief. Oettingen-Wallerstein was twice created; first as a partition of Oettingen (modern day town of Oettingen in Bayern) in 1423 which became extinct in 1486 and was inherited by Oettingen-Oettingen, and the second time as a partition of Oettingen-Oettingen in 1557. Oettingen-Oettingen suffered one partition, between itself and Oettingen-Spielberg in 1602. It was raised to a Principality in 1774, mediatised to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806, and divided with the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in 1810.

Italian or of Italian style\\", expanding the 1989 print edition's \\"A sideboard\\". It also appears in OED as Credence, as well as in John Gloag, A Short Dictionary of Furniture (London, 1977), where Credence is described as \\"a small side-table for vessels, used as a serving table\\", noting 16th-century usage and quoting John Britton, A Dictionary of the Art and Archaeology of the Middle Ages 1838: \\"a shelf-like projection placed across a piscina, or within a niche as a place for sacred vessels used at mass; also a buffet or sideboard for plate\\". and usually made of burnished and polished wood and decorated with marquetry. The top would often be made of marble, or another decorative liquid- and heat-resistant stone. The credenza started as a rough table with a cloth draped over it. In early 14th century of Italy, it took on an architectural form with column and pilaster decorations. In modern times, a credenza is more often a type of sideboard used in the home or restaurant. In dining rooms, it is typically made from wood and used as a platform to serve buffet meals. In restaurant kitchens, made from stainless steel, it provides a side surface and storage cupboards. Etymology Originally in Italian the name meant belief or trust (etymologically connected to the English word \\"credence\\"). In the 16th century the act of credenza was the tasting of food and drinks by a servant for a lord or other important person (such as the pope or a cardinal) in order to test for poison. The name may have passed then to the room where the act took place, then to the furniture.

Chiasm is produced in Detroit, MI United States.  Origin  At the age of five, Emileigh Rohn began taking piano lessons from her church organist, Mildred Benson, and eventually began singing solos in church. By the age of 13 she received a Casiotone keyboard and began experimenting with electronic music. In her final year of high school she joined an experimental/industrial performance art group called Inter Animi. In the fall of 1997, while studying molecular biology in Detroit, Rohn joined Calvin P. Simmons in his project Dragon Tears Descending (DTD) as a keyboardist doing performances and supporting other bands. Rohn then left DTD and formed her own project Electrophoretic Transfer with sampling from Shane Terpening by 1998. Chiasm began in 1998 when Rohn began to entirely produce her own music with her first demo CD named \\"Embryonic\\" completed in October. Her song \\"Bouncing Baby Clones\\" featured on a Detroit Electronica compilation CD, D[elEcTROnIc]T, in the spring of 1999.

History The predecessor of Celestron was Valor Electronics, an electronics and military components firm founded in 1955 by Tom Johnson. Johnson became involved with telescopes when he built a 6\\" reflecting telescope for his two sons. In 1960, Johnson established the \\"Astro-Optical\\" division of Valor, which would later become Celestron. By 1964, Johnson had founded \\"Celestron Pacific\\" as a division of Valor Electronics offering Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes from 4\\" to 22\\". In 1970 Celestron introduced its \\"C8\\" 8\\" diameter 2032 mm focal length, ∆í10 telescope, the first of a new line of telescopes built using methods developed by Celestron to produce Schmidt-Cassegrains at a high volume and low cost. These models made significant inroads into the amateur astronomical and educational communities. Johnson, the founder of the company, sold Celestron in 1980. Celestron was acquired by Tasco in 1997 and almost went out of business when Tasco folded in 2001. In early 2002 Celestron's rival, Meade Instruments, attempted a takeover but a bankruptcy court allowed the sale of the company back to its original owners. The company had been U.S. owned until April 2005 when it was acquired by SW Technology Corporation, a Delaware company and affiliate of Synta Technology Corporation of Taiwan. Synta is a manufacturer of astronomy equipment and related components and at that time had been a supplier for Celestron for over 15 years.prnewswire.com, Celestron Purchased by SW Technology Corporation, a Delaware Company, Affiliate of Synta Technology Corporation - TORRANCE, Calif., April 6 /PRNewswire On March 13, 2012, Tom Johnson died at the age of 89.

The telescope line had a trademark matte orange tube (changed to glossy black in 1980, and back to semi-gloss orange in 2006), and double-fork equatorial mount, and became a popular large aperture, compact design. Other telescope product lines include the CGE, CGEM, CPC, NexStar, Omni, Onyx, AstroMaster, Ambassador, TravelScope, and PowerSeeker product lines. These range from large computerized reflectors with GPS to decorative/casual viewing telescopes with brass tube refractors on wood mounts.

Most of the computerized models can be connected to an external computer via an RS-232 cable, allowing them to be controlled by a third-party astronomy program or connected to a GPS receiver. GPS receivers are useful for programming the telescope with its precise location and time, which aids the alignment process required for GoTo. Some motorized telescopes sold during the mid 80s to early 90s, including the Celestron Compustar¬Æ which used a form of GoTo technology, were not programmed to allow for dates after 2000; making some Celestron products susceptible to the Y2K bug. However, a third party chip to update the computer is available for some products. Competition with Meade Since their founding in 1972, Meade Instruments has been one of Celestron's chief rivals. Design, sizing, introduction, and pricing of each company's products lines and models have been in response to their competition with each other. There has been litigation over infringement of patents between the two companies, one instance regarding GoTo technology. In September 2013, Sunny Optics Inc, a unit of the Chinese firm Ningbo Sunny Electronic Co Ltd, completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Meade.

In 2006 it merged with the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) to form the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). Before the merger the IIE had approximately 40,000 members. The IET is now the second largest engineering society in the world next to the IEEE. The IET has the authority to establish professional registration of engineers (Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer) through the Engineering Council. The IEEE does not have the authority to replicate the registration process in its complementary environment.  History  The IIE traces its heritage to the Vulcanic Society that was founded in 1884. The Vulcanic Society was formed by a group of apprentices from the works of Maudslay, Son & Field Ltd, in Lambeth, London. This society went through three name changes before it became the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1902, which became the Institution of General Technician Engineers in 1970 and the Institute of Mechanical and General Technician Engineers (IMGTechE) in 1976. In 1982 the IMGTechE and Institution of Technician Engineers in Mechanical Engineering (ITEME) merged to form the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers (IMechIE). The Institution of Electrical and Electronic Incorporated Engineers (IEEIE) and the Society of Electronic and Radio Technicians (SERT) merged in 1990 to form the Institution of Electronics and Electrical Incorporated Engineers (IEEIE). The IIE was formed in April 1998 by the merger of the IMechIE, the IEEIE and The Institute of Engineers and Technicians (IET). In 1999 The Institution of Incorporated Executive Engineers (IIExE) merged with the IIE. In October 2001, IIE received a Royal Charter in recognition of the significant contribution of its members to the UK economy and society. In 2005 The Society of Engineers also merged with the IIE. Formation of the IET Discussions started in 2004 between the IEE and the IIE about the formation of a new institution, the Institution of Engineering and Technology. Following members voting in favour of the merger, the IET became operational on 31 March 2006.

They live wedged in between the Nandi, Luo and Luhya (Luyia) peoples. Among the Luo they are known as nyang√≥√≥ri, but to the Terik, this is a derogatory term. The Terik call themselves Terikeek; in their usage, 'Terik' refers to their language, land, and culture. History According to their own oral history the Terik are \\"people of Mount Elgon\\"; this is confirmed by linguistic evidence as well as by Bong'om traditions that \\"the people who later called themselves Terik were still Bong'om when they left Elgon and moved away in a southern direction\\" (Roeder 1986:142). In pre-colonial times, relations between the Terik and the Nandi (their eastern neighbours) were characterized by mutual raids for cattle, land and women, a perspective still alive among old Terik people. However, in recent years the Terik have increasingly come to perceive the Nandi as friendly relatives. A number of factors have contributed to this change in perspective. Territorial expansion of the Luhya people (the western neighbours of the Terik) has strained Terik-Luhyia relations during the last decades. Luhya are felt to be a threat to the Terik identity and intermarriage has drastically reduced. The expansion of the Luhya (especially the Logoli group) into Terik territory has been a cause of population pressure. This, along with dwindling agricultural potential in the area, has in the second half of the twentieth century motivated many of the Terik to move eastwards, into 'Nandiland' as they call it. Some Terik even claim that they abandoned their homeland because they were afraid of the Luhya. The Terik have become increasingly oriented at and assimilated to the Nandi. One of the results is a change towards a Nandi-type age set system. The Terik traditionally have twelve age sets, whereas the Nandi have seven. Terik living in Nandiland tend to name a smaller number of age sets than those living in traditional Terik territory. Terik boys also undergo initiation together with Nandi boys. Assimilation to the Nandi has furthermore been accelerated by the growth of a common Kalenjin consciousness, a process which started in the early 1950s. In recent years, migration into Nandiland has decreased, and the position of the Terik language has been strengthened. Terik schools now teach Terik language.

After his daughter married the Crown Prince, he became a national celebrity due to a number of articles in the yellow press, especially Se og H√∏r.  Early life  He and Mette-Marit's mother, Marit Tjessem, divorced in 1984. After the divorce, Mette-Marit grew up with her mother, stepfather, and siblings, while visiting her father regularly on weekends. She later revealed in an interview that her father also suffered from alcoholism, which she \\"had to hide\\" from her friends. H√∏iby worked for several years as a journalist in a local newspaper and as a small- scale advertiser and publisher in his hometown. By the time his daughter's relationship to the Crown Prince was publicly known, he had retired from working and was receiving a disability pension. In his younger days, he participated in athletics. Among others, he achieved a time of 58.0 seconds in the 400 metres hurdles in 1959. He represented the club Kristiansands IF.  Tabloids  Sven O. H√∏iby became something of a controversial figure following his daughter's marriage to the Crown Prince. The national tabloids and especially the gossip magazine Se og H√∏r printed several stories where he gave interviews and was presented in less-than-flattering situations. \\"En helt vanlig dag p√• jobben\\" (\\"Just another day at the office\\"), a book published by former Se og H√∏r journalist H√•vard Meln√¶s, who knew H√∏iby personally, reveals that H√∏iby was being paid up to 400,000 Norwegian krone a year by the magazine to appear in articles, and for sharing private pictures and information about his daughter's childhood. The magazine even purchased a mobile phone for him (he couldn't afford one himself) and paid his phone bills as a bonus for his \\"services\\". During this period he made several outspoken comments, and he announced that he was writing a book about Mette-Marit's young son, Marius, her child from a previous relationship. The book never materialised, but the relationship between father and daughter had been strained by this, and H√∏iby giving information about her to the tabloids. H√∏iby further estranged himself from his daughter by marrying Renate Barsg√•rd, a former stripper half his age. The couple divorced after three months. At their wedding, folk singer Sputnik was best man. The magazine and other tabloids have been criticized for taking advantage of a man who seemed to have a less than sound judgment on what kind of articles to participate in. In his book Meln√¶s reveals that as H√∏iby had financial problems, he could not afford to say \\"no\\" to any suggestions from Se og H√∏r. Father and daughter had reportedly reconciled some time before his death and he was, among other events, invited to attend the baptism of his granddaughter, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, in 2004.  Death  On 25 August 2006 H√∏iby told Se og H√∏r that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on 21 March 2007, aged 70. H√∏iby is buried at Kristiansand Cemetery together with his parents.

The IET was formed in 2006 from two separate institutions: the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), dating back to 1871, and the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (IIE) dating back to 1884. Its worldwide membership is currently in excess of 168,000. The IET's main offices are in Savoy Place in London, England and at Michael Faraday House in Stevenage, England. In the United Kingdom, the IET has the authority to establish professional registration for the titles of Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Engineering Technician, and ICT Technician, as a licensed member institution of the Engineering Council.\\"About professional registration\\", IET. The IET is registered as a charity in England and Wales, and in Scotland. Formation IET Savoy Place Discussions started in 2004 between the IEE and the IIE about merging to form a new institution. In September 2005, both institutions held votes of the merger and the members voted in favour (73.5% IEE, 95.7% IIE). This merger also needed government approval, so a petition was then made to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom for a Supplemental Charter, to allow the creation of the new institution. This was approved by the Privy Council on December 14, 2005, and the new institution emerged on March 31, 2006. History of the IEE The Society of Telegraph Engineers (STE) was formed on May 17, 1871, and it published the Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers from 1872 through 1880. Carl Wilhelm Siemens was first President of IEE in 1872. On December 22, 1880, the STE was renamed as the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electricians and, as part of this change, it renamed its journal the Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electricians (1881 ‚Äì 82) and later the Journal of the Society of Telegraph-Engineers and Electricians (1883 ‚Äì 88). Following a meeting of its Council on 10 November 1887, it was decided to adopt the name of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). As part of this change, its Journal was renamed Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1889, and it kept this title through 1963. In 1921, the Institution was Incorporated by royal charter and, following mergers with the Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers (IERE) in 1988 and the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers (IMfgE) in 1990, it had a worldwide membership of around 120,000. The IEE represented the engineering profession, operated Professional Networks (worldwide groups of engineers sharing common technical and professional interests), had an educational role including the accreditation of degree courses and operated schemes to provide awards scholarships, grants and prizes. It was well known for publication of the IEE Wiring Regulations which now continue to be written by the IET and to be published by the British Standards Institution as BS 7671. The IET hosts the archive for the Women's Engineering Society (WES) and it has also provided office space for WES since 2005. History of the IIE The modern Institution of Incorporated Engineers (IIE) traced its heritage to The Vulcanic Society that was founded in 1884 and became the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1902, which became the Institution of General Technician Engineers in 1970. It changed its name in 1976 to the Institution of Mechanical and General Technician Engineers. At this point it merged with the Institution of Technician Engineers in Mechanical Engineering and formed the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers in 1988. The Institution of Engineers in Charge, which was founded in 1895, was merged into the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers (IMechIE) in 1990. The Institution of Electrical and Electronic Technician Engineers, the Society of Electronic and Radio Technicians, and the Institute of Practitioners in Radio and Electronics merged in 1990 to form the Institution of Electronics and Electrical Incorporated Engineers (IEEIE). The IIE was formed in April 1998 by the merger of The Institution of Electronic and Electrical Incorporated Engineers (IEEIE), The Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers (IMechIE), and The Institute of Engineers and Technicians (IET, not to be confused with the later-formed Institution of Engineering and Technology). In 1999 there was a further merger with The Institution of Incorporated Executive Engineers (IIExE). The IIE had a worldwide membership of approximately 40,000. History of the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers The Institution of Manufacturing Engineers (IMfgE), formerly the Institution of Production Engineers (IProdE), was founded following the initiative of one H. E. Honer who wrote to a technical periodical titled ‚ÄòEngineering Production‚Äô suggesting that the time was ripe to form an institution for the specialised interests of engineers engaged in manufacture. As a result of correspondence generated by this letter a meeting was held at Cannon Street Hotel in London on 26 February 1921. At this meeting it was decided to form the IProdE in order to; establish the status and designation of production or manufacturing engineers; to promote the science of practical production in industry; and to facilitate the interchange of ideas between engineers, manufacturers and other specialists. The term ‚Äòproduction engineering‚Äô came into use to describe the management of factory production techniques first developed by Henry Ford, which had expanded greatly during the First World War. The IProdE was incorporated in 1931 and was granted its armorial bearings in 1937. From the outset the Institution operated through decentralised branches called local sections wherever a sufficient number of members existed. These local sections were self-governing and elected their own officers. Local sections held monthly meetings at which papers were read and discussed. Outstanding papers were published in the Institution's journal. Named papers commemorating the work of the following eminent production engineers were read at national meetings: Viscount Nuffield, Sir Alfred Herbert, Colonel George Bray, Lord Sempill, E. H. Hancock, and J. N. Kirby. National and regional conferences were also arranged dealing with specific industrial problems. Active councils were gradually established worldwide including in Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, and South Africa. The Institution's education committee established a graduate examination which all junior entrants undertook from 1932 onwards. An examination for Associate Membership was introduced in 1951. The Second World War further accelerated developments in production engineering and by 1945 membership of the IProdE stood at 5,000. The 1950s and 1960s were perhaps the most fruitful period for the Institution. Major conferences such as ‚ÄòThe Automatic Factory‚Äô in 1955 ensured that the Institution held a place at the forefront of production technology. A Royal Charter was granted in 1964 and membership stood at over 17,000 by 1969. In 1981 the IProdE instituted four medals as part of its Diamond Jubilee celebrations comprising; the International Award, the Mensforth Gold Medal, the Nuffield Award and the Silver Medal. The Mensforth Gold Medal was named after Sir Eric Mensforth, founder and chairman of Westland Helicopters and a former IProdE President. The medal was awarded to British recipients who had made an outstanding contribution to the advancement of production engineering technology. Today the Mensforth Manufacturing Gold Medal is the IET's premier manufacturing award. Financial constraints, a slowing in membership and a blurring of distinctions between the various branches of engineering led the IProdE to merger proposals in the late 1980s. The Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) had interests very close to those of the IProdE. The IEE was a much larger organisation than the IProdE and the proposal was that the IProdE should be represented as a specialist division within the IEE. While these talks were reaching fruition in 1991 the IProdE changed its name to the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers. A merger with the IEE took place the same year, with the IMfgE becoming the IEE's new Manufacturing Division. IET Presidents The IET is governed by the President and Board of Trustees . The IET Council, on the other hand, serves as the advisory and consultative body, representing views of the members at large and offering advice to the Board of Trustees. Since founding the IET, several prominent engineers have served as its President and the recent Presidents are listed below: Purpose and function The IET represents the engineering profession in matters of public concern and assists governments to make the public aware of engineering and technological issues. It provides advice on all areas of engineering, regularly advising Parliament and other agencies. The IET also grants Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Engineering Technician, and ICT Technician professional designations on behalf of the Engineering Council UK. IEng is roughly equivalent to North American Professional Engineer designations and CEng is set at a higher level. Both designations have far greater geographical recognition. This is made possible through a number of networks for engineers established by the IET including the Professional Networks, worldwide groups of engineers sharing common technical and professional interests. Through the IET website, these networks provide up-to- date sector-specific news, stock a library of technical articles and give members the opportunity to exchange knowledge and ideas with peer groups through dedicated discussion forums. Particular areas of focus include education, IT, energy and the environment. The IET has an educational role, seeking to support its members through their careers by offering a professional home for life, producing advice and guidance at all levels to secure the future of engineering. For instance, the IET accredits degree courses worldwide in subjects relevant to electrical, electronic, manufacturing and information engineering. In addition, it secures funding for professional development schemes for engineering graduates including awards scholarships, grants and prizes. For the public, the IET website provides factfiles on topics such as solar power, nuclear power, fuel cells, micro- generation and the possible effects on health of mobile phones and power lines. The IET runs the bibliographic information service Inspec, which is a major indexing database of scientific and technical literature and publishes books, journals such as Electronics Letters, magazines such as Engineering & Technology and conference proceedings. Over 80,000 technical articles are available via the IET Digital Library. IET.tv is one of the world's largest collated resources of authoritative and multidisciplinary engineering and technology content. Comprising in excess of 6,500 presentation, lecture and training videos, this high quality engineering information offers research insight, workflow solutions and access to inspirational events and expert communities. With a range of search and user functionalities, IET.tv enables online video access to a range of topics and expertise. IET.tv also has an YouTube presence, where it publishes a wide variety of content related to engineering and technology.

It is approximately away from Singapore Changi Airport and about away from the city-centre. The airfield was originally opened in 1928 as RAF Seletar, a military airbase of the British Royal Air Force. The base was handed back over to the Singapore government in 1971. History =RAF Seletar= RAF Seletar Badge RAF Seletar was a Royal Air Force station in Singapore between 1928 and 1971. Plans for establishing an airfield, flying boat and naval base in Singapore were first agreed by the RAF in 1921. In 1923, two sites in the northern region of the island were approved. The first planes to arrive at the base were four Supermarine Southampton seaplanes on 28 February 1928. RAF Seletar served was also used for civilian flights from 1930 to 1937, when Kallang Airport was opened. Amy Johnson landed at Seletar in May 1930 on her UK ‚Äì Australia flight in her Gipsy Moth named 'Jason'. Amelia Earhart also landed there in June 1937 on her world flight attempt in an Lockheed 10 Electra. World War II With the threat of war in the area, the RAF started building up their forces in the Far East in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Seletar airfield was the target of carpet bombing when Japanese navy bombers conducted the first air raid on Singapore, sometime after their ground forces invaded Kota Bahru. It was abandoned when the Japanese took Johor Bahru, which brought their artillery in range of the airfield. When the Japanese launched their invasion of Malaya and Singapore, Seletar housed four RAF units. 205 Sqn operated Consolidated Catalina flying boats, and No. 36 and No. 100 Squadron RAF operated obsolete Vickers Vildebeest torpedo bombers (as well as five Fairey Albacores acquired by 36 Sqn to supplement its Vildebeests). These flying squadrons were serviced by 151 Maintenance Unit RAF. 21 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force was also based at Seletar in 1941‚Äì42, and was in the process of converting from lightly-armed CAC Wirraway trainers to Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters, when hostilities began. These units stayed until Jan‚ÄìFeb 1942, soon before the surrender to the invading Japanese.Shores et al. 1992, p. 146. During the Japanese occupation, Seletar as was in the case of Sembawang came under the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service while Tengah fell under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. From 1942 through 1945, a number of IJN squadrons were based or transited through Seletar mainly, for training. Among the units known to be based at Seletar during this time were 936th K≈çk≈´tai (B5N Kate, D3A Val and E13A1 Jake), 381st K≈çk≈´tai (A6M Zero and J2M Raiden). The 601st K≈çk≈´tai was also stationed there for training early before its destruction on board Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea (Marianas Turkey Shoot) in June. Seletar's present runway was built during the Japanese Occupation. Post-World War II Royal Navy and RAF officers watch as Vice Admiral Kogure appends his signature to the document marking the formal takeover of Seletar airfield from the Japanese, 8 September 1945. After World War II, the base went back to the RAF and, in the late 1940s and 1950s, the base was heavily involved in the Malayan Emergency, with Beaufighters, Spitfires and Mosquitos based there while operating against Malayan Communist insurgents. Among the many squadrons based there during this time were Nos 60, 81 and 205 Sqns of the RAF.Jefford 2001, pp. 48‚Äì49. The base was also the home of 390 MU ‚Äì the Maintenance Base for the whole of the Far East Air Force - FEAF. During the 1960s, RAF Seletar was home base to No's 103 and 110 Squadrons, both of which were equipped with Westland Whirlwind Mk 10 helicopters and to 34 Squadron, which was equipped with Blackburn Beverley transports. All three Squadrons (among several others) were involved with support of operations in North Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation. From June 1962, 66 Squadron (led by Sqn Leader Gray) with their Bristol 192 Belvedere helicopters were also based at Seletar, and were sent on frequent tours and detachments to Kuching, Brunei, Labuan and Butterworth as part of the Borneo hearts and minds campaign (the squadron was later disbanded in March 1969). The helicopter squadrons provided a search and rescue service for the Singapore area. The station was also, at that time, home to 209 Squadron, equipped with Single and Twin Pioneer aircraft. 65 Squadron based at Seletar operated Bloodhound Mk II surface-to-air missiles as anti-aircraft defence from 1 January 1964 until the squadron was disbanded on 30 March 1970 with the equipment and role handed over to 170 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force. Auster aircraft were flown during the Emergency and Confrontation periods in troop/enemy spotting patrols. In December 1966, three Andover CC Mk1 arrived to replace the ageing Vickers Valetta C1 aircraft of 52 Sqn. 52 Squadron was later reformed in March 1967 after the arrival of a further three aircraft. By now, Confrontation had finished and with no purpose the squadron moved to Changi in 1968 before being disbanded in January 1970. British Pullout The RAF station closed at the end of March 1971 (see East of Suez) and Seletar was handed over to the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC), which by 1973, after the British pullout, became the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). Several classic aircraft types flew their last RAF operational sorties from Seletar including the Short Singapore flying boat (Mk.III K6912 of No. 205 Squadron RAF 14 October 1941, aircraft transferred to No. 5 Squadron RNZAF), Supermarine Spitfire (PR.XIX PS888 of 81 Sqn 1954), De Havilland Mosquito (PR.34 RG314 of 81 Sqn 1955), Short Sunderland flying boat (GR.5 ML797 \\"P\\" of 205 Sqn, 15 May 1959) and Bristol Beaufighter (TT.X RD761 Station Flight 1960). The Short Sunderland flying boats started in RAF service from Seletar on 22 June 1938 with 230 Sqn,Rawlings 1969, p. 242. a sister squadron of 205 Sqn. =Seletar Airbase= The formative years of the SADC (later the RSAF) was established at Seletar Airbase in September 1968, with the setting up of the Flying Training School (FTS) utilising three Cessna 172G/H on loan from the Singapore Flying Club. The subsequent arrival of eight new Cessna 172Ks in May 1969, took over the duty from the former and contributed to the increase of training tempo for more selected trainees to participate in the basic flight-training course. Current operations Seletar Airport now operates as a general aviation airport, mainly for chartered flights, private aircraft operations and training purposes. The airport is open 24 hours a day. It has a single runway with 27 aircraft stands, 100 square metres of warehouse space and can handle 840 tons of freight per day. In 1998, the airport recorded receiving a total of 7,945 scheduled flights, handled 23,919 passengers and 6,025 tons of cargo. The airport fire service, AES Seletar, is provided by Changi Airport Group. AES Seletar has 1 station housing 6 apparatus (water tender, foam tender and others) and provides Level 7 protection. The Republic of Singapore Flying Club, Seletar Flying Club and Singapore Flying College are situated at Seletar Airport. The Singapore Flying College also conducts its flying training at Jandakot Airport in Perth, Western Australia and at Sunshine Coast Airport in Maroochydore, Queensland. Another prominent flying school is the Singapore Youth Flying Club, which has its headquarters built on western side of the airport's runway. Completed in June 2003, the clubhouse also has its own parking bays for its fleet of Diamond DA40. Also, the rotary training unit of Republic of Singapore Air Force ‚Äì 124 Squadron, has a training detachment at the civilian airport although it is normally headquartered at Sembawang Air Base. Previously, Berjaya Air operated scheduled flights to Tioman and Redang. The Berjaya Air service ended on 31 October 2010 and relocated to Changi Airport. Expansion Changi Airport Group took over the management of the airport from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore on 1 July 2009. In 2011 the runway was extended to 1,840 metres to enable larger and heavier aircraft to use the airport. The airport underwent refurbishment in 2015 as part of plans to relieve pressure on Changi Airport. The plan was to optimise its capacity and move smaller and slower aircraft from Changi to Seletar airport. A new passenger terminal building opened on 19 November 2018, replacing the previous passenger terminal. The terminal houses four check-in counters, six immigration lanes, two security screening stations and a gate holdroom that can accommodate 200 passengers. Instrument Landing System (ILS) Controversy With Malaysia Malaysia banned its airline Firefly, one of two subsidiaries of state-owned Malaysia Airlines from using Seletar airport after the relocation of its ATR 72 turboprop aircraft from Changi Airport in Singapore, which was due to commence operation on 1 December 2018. Changi has phased out the use of turboprop aircraft and Singapore has designated Seletar as the airport for turboprop operation. The ban was imposed on Firefly after Singapore published the Seletar's Aeronautical Information Publication for the Instrument landing system on 1 December 2018 that covers Johor airspace over Pasir Gudang, an act which Malaysia claimed violated its sovereign territory. The ban impacted the flight operation plans of two other Malaysian-based airlines, Berjaya Air and Malindo Air which also planned to commence operations between Seletar and Malaysian destinations in 2019. =Installation of an ILS for Seletar Airport= As early as January 2012, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) had indicated that an ILS will be installed at Seletar Airport by 2014 as part of the upgrading work for the airport, which had commenced expansion and improvement works since 2008. In 2014, Singapore had formally informed the then Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia, currently known as the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM), that all turboprop aircraft, private jets and chartered aircraft from Changi Airport will be relocated to Seletar Airport by end-2018. Changi Airport Group, (CAG) the airport operator for Changi and Seletar, said that it had been working with Firefly since 2014 to prepare for Firefly's shift to Seletar airport, as part of a plan to move all turboprop aircraft movements out of Changi airport and that Singapore has made all preparations and approved all applications by Firefly to commence scheduled turboprop operations at Seletar airport from 1 December 2018, without affecting operational efficiency or flight safety. In July 2017, Ignatius Ong Ming Choy CEO of Firefly, a subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and a respected member in the aviation community, had raised the issue of an ILS which has not been in installed in Seletar, to the Singapore civil aviation authority, in which Firefly believed that the lack of an ILS impacted on Seletar airport's aim to be \\"a proper commercial airport\\" as the ILS will improve aviation safety and enhance operational efficiency of descending aircraft into the airport during poor weather, night landing or adverse visibility. Ignatius Ong had represented Malaysia Airlines in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing as a leading member of the responsive MAS crisis management team that dealt directly with traumatised relatives of those in the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. =Consultation Meetings on ILS and Firefly's Move to Seletar= By end-2017, a draft ILS procedure for descending aircraft into Seletar airport for Runway 03 and Runway 21 had been presented by CAAS to the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia also known as the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) for consultations and feedback. Singapore needed CAAM's input for the ILS installation in Seletar as the ILS will covers Malaysian airspace over Pasir Gudang, which was delegated to Singapore in 1973 by Malaysia, with the approval of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). On 5 December 2017, in a meeting in Kuala Lumpur between the civil aviation authorities of Malaysia and Singapore, the draft ILS operational procedures for Seletar airport was further discussed, and the draft Instrument Approach charts and overview maps showing the full details of the incoming descending approach and missed approach procedures for Seletar Airport ILS were presented by CAAS to the Malaysian authorities. In that meeting, CAAS informed CAAM that, to facilitate the move of turboprop operators like Firefly to Seletar by end-2018 and improve the safety and operational efficiency of aircraft operations, Singapore intended to install an ILS at Seletar between December 2017 and February 2018 with an Airport Instrument Approach (AIP) Supplement charts to be published by 31 May 2018 and made effective by 16 August 2018. Further as the Seletar ILS will cover part of the Malaysian airspace over Pasir Gudang that was delegated to Singapore, CAAS informed CAAM in that meeting that Singapore \\"would send DCA Malaysia the draft charts and details as part of the formal consultative process to enable the publications of the (ILS) procedures.\\" 0n 6 December 2017, CAAS sent an email to CAAM, together with the all the draft charts and details, and further informed that should Malaysia requires more information about the ILS or wishes to highlights any concern about the system, the CAAS would be ready to address all technical issues. Since there was no response for six months from Malaysia until 6 June 2018 (which by then was already past the CAAS's intended publication date for the ILS-AIPs on 31 May 2018) Singapore sent another email to Malaysia requesting for an update on the ILS issue, as CAAS intended to publish the ILS-AIP data on the revised date of 7 June 2018. On 7 August 2018, the two civil aviation authorities met in Kuala Lumpur where CAAS provided additional details on the Seletar ILS procedures, and Singapore requested from Malaysia for its urgent feedback on the ILS. On 15 August 2018 15, CAAS sent to CAAM another email stressing the urgency of Malaysia's feedback on the ILS matter due to the impending move by Firefly to Seletar on 1 December 2018, and Singapore requested CAAM's prompt response by 27 August 2018, but there was no reply from CAAM to the Singapore requests. At the sidelines of an International Civil Aviation Organization event soon after, Singapore continued to engage with Malaysia for an update on the ILS issue, without success. On 14 November 2018, Firefly informed CAAS that it was \\"unable to obtain approval from its regulator, CAAM, to operate into Seletar airport\\". =Suspension of Firefly's Malaysia-Singapore operations= In an announcement on 22 November 2018, Firefly announced on its website that it will suspend all of its 10 daily flights between Singapore and the three Malaysian towns of Subang, Kuantan and Ipoh from 1 December 2018, until \\"the relevant authorities have cleared remaining matters in relation to the Singapore authority's plans to move turboprop operations from Changi International to Seletar (Airport)‚Äù. The Firefly announcement was described as \\"rather unusual \\" by Brendan Sobie, the Southeast Asia chief representative for the Centre for Aviation (CAPA). The suspension resulted in more than 12,000 Firefly customers adversely affected and many were transferred to Malaysian Airlines (MAS), Firefly's parent company, thus incurring considerable losses to both airlines and causing negative impacts on the aviation sectors on both Malaysia and Singapore. Firefly could not obtained its landing slots to Changi airport since those slots were already sold to other non-turboprop operators. Firefly's intended move was thus vetoed by Malaysia which had said that the move will be detrimental to the development of Malaysian interests in Pasir Gudang, Johor and that the flight path had intruded into Malaysian airspace and therefore violated Malaysian sovereignty and development of its international port. On 23 November 2018, Malaysia declared in a media statement that Singapore had never discussed an ILS for Seletar Airport with CAAM and Malaysia \\"was never consulted (by Singapore) on the timeline to move scheduled turboprop operations to Seletar Airport starting Dec 1, 2018\\". CAAM's Airport Standard Division director Dr Zainul Fuad Md Wahi in a press conference stated that CAAM did not receive any communication from Singapore about the ILS and that the \\"requirement (to fly over Pasir Gudang) was never communicated to CAAM, and CAAM had never made any indication that CAAM agreed with it, especially when taking into consideration that it would affect the development over Pasir Gudang and its international port\\". Zainul Fuad Md Wahi added that the Seletar ILS issue surfaced only when Firefly was asked to move its flights from Changi Airport to Seletar by 1 December 2018. On Thursday 29 November 2018, both civil aviation bodies met in Singapore where CAAM raised its technical concerns with the Seletar ILS procedures, which were promptly addressed by CAAS during that meeting. Singapore again conveyed to Malaysia of its intentions to publish the long-delayed ILS and AIP procedures on 1 December 2018, seven months later than the originally planned for 31 May 2018. On Friday 30 November 2018 and with Firefly's scheduled move to Seletar to be conducted less than one day away on 1 December 2018, CAAS team flew to Kuala Lumpur to meet CAAM to discuss the records of the 29 Nov meeting, including whether there was any new issue on the ILS or other matters, as well as to facilitate Firefly operations (which had been suspended) between Malaysia and Singapore from 1 December 2018 onwards. During that meeting, Malaysia did not raised any new concern to Singapore regarding the ILS, airspace sovereignty or other new issues, and the records of discussion during the two meetings on the 29 and 30 November 2018 by the two sides were minuted, including Singapore's intention to publish the ILS-AIP data on the next day, 1 December 2018, to facilitate Firefly relocation to Seletar airport from Changi airport. =Publication of the Aeronautical Information Publication= On 1 December 2018, CAAS officially published the AIP Supplement AIP SUP 079/2018-1 AIP Singapore for the implementation of ILS and Approach Procedure for Seletar Runway 21 which shall be effective as at 3 January 2019 and informed all stakeholders, including CAAM, Firefly and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada, thus clearing the way from the Singapore side for Firefly to commence commercial flight operations between Subang-Seletar, Ipoh-Seletar and Kuantan-Seletar operations. in the event Firefly managed to obtain the approval from CAAM to do so. Firefly, being the sole turboprop operator to Changi Airport and already with the much-coveted landing slots and firm schedules to Seletar Airport would have been the biggest commercial flight operator into Seletar airport as others like Berjaya Air, Malindo Air, Wings Air, City Link have not been as prepared as Firefly, with Berjaya Air expected to fly to Seletar later in February 2019 together with Malindo Air =Objections in Malaysian Parliament= Addressing the Malaysian Parliament on Monday, 3 December 2018, the transport minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook said that Singapore's ILS proposal had violated Malaysian sovereignty by publishing the ILS-AIP procedures for Seletar Airport on 1 December 2018 without CAAM's approval, and the Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send a statement of protest to Singapore over the territorial violation caused by Singapore's publication of the ILS procedures. Loke added that Malaysia was informed by Singapore only around October 2018 of Singapore's intent to commence ILS operations for Seletar airport. and that during the meetings on 28 and 29 Nov between the two national aviation bodies of Malaysia and Singapore, CAAM had conveyed to Singapore not to allow CAAS to broadcast its ILS, which Singapore ignored and proceeded to broadcast the ILS from 3 January 2018. In the parliamentary speech, Loke said that Malaysia had informed Singapore that it would be taking back its delegated airspace between 2019 and 2023, which was delegated to Singapore in 1974 under the Operational Letter of Agreement between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore Area Control Centers Concerning Singapore Arrivals, Departures And Overflight (LOA 1974). Within hours of Loke's statements, Singapore released a minutes of meeting dated 5 December 2017 and email correspondences dated 6 December 2017 and 17 June 2018 between CAAS and CAAM to counter Loke's claims that Malaysia was informed about the ILS only around October 2018 as well as to counter CAAM's Zainul Fuad Md Wahi's statement that CAAM was never informed by CAAS about an ILS for Seletar airport. Reacting to Singapore's releases of the correspondences, Loke said on 10 December 2018 that Singapore was being partial and selective in the choice of correspondences it published and he challenged Singapore to release four other letters dated 9 October 2018, 15, 21 and 28 November 2018 which Singapore failed to do so. Malaysia further feedback to Singapore that \\"failing to do so, we (Malaysia) are prepared to release the letters for full disclosure of such information for the public's comprehension of our stand on the same.\\" On the same day (10 December 2018) Singapore informed Malaysia that Singapore had no objections for Malaysia to proceed and release all the letters, email correspondences and records of discussions on the ILS between CAAM and CAAS, but not limited to just the four letters as mentioned earlier by Malaysia, but to include all correspondences and minutes of discussions for total transparency regarding the CAAM-CAAS negotiations on the Seletar airport's ILS unit. After Singapore announced that it had no objections to Malaysia's threatened release of the CAAM-CAAS letters, Malaysia announced on 12 December 2018 that it declined to release any correspondence on the Seletar ILS citing the need for confidentiality. Malaysian Transport Ministry said that it is a \\"matter of principle not to release correspondence between parties to address media queries and get public support and it agreed with its Singaporean counterpart that it would be useful for negotiations to be kept confidential to facilitate frank and constructive exchanges.\\" =Issues Raised Between Malaysia and Singapore=  Violation of Malaysian Sovereignty  That video showed that since the south-bound flight path to Seletar airport overflew Pasir Gudang, the ILS operations violated Malaysia territorial rights. The airspace over Johor delegated to Singapore in 1974 under the Operational Letter of Agreement between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore Area Control Centers Concerning Singapore Arrivals, Departures And Overflight (LOA 1974) and CAAS was of the view that airspace sovereignty and ILS operational procedures are separate issues, since Singapore had never denied that the airspace over Pasir Gudang is Malaysian territory. It was pointed out that Malaysian air traffic controls had similarly overlapped the national territories of Brunei, Indonesia and Thailand, where Brunei's upper airspace is managed by Malaysia under the Kota Kinabalu Flight Information Region, which also covers the Indonesian waters around Kuching Airport, which is outside Malaysian territory Changi Airport similarly has ILSs that extended into Johor in southern Malaysia and over Batam Island in the Riau region of Indonesia while the Singapore Flight Information Region extended northwards to the Malaysia-Thailand border and into the territorial waters of Vietnam and eastwards towards the Philippines Sea. Kota Kinabalu FIR covers Brunei northern airspace as well as the airspace over Indonesia territorial waters near Kuching Airport. Indonesia managed the airspace over Australia's Christmas Island and Timor Leste. while in Europe for example, Denmark managed airspaces over Sweden and Scotland. ILS Imposed Compulsory Height Restrictions In his Facebook video post dated 11 December 2018, Loke claimed that the ILS in Seletar will impact Pasir Gudang sea port developments and will place compulsory height restrictions on the port and developments in Pasir Gudang and further north all the way northwards to the towns of Air Tawar and the outskirts of Kota Tinggi, about 25 km north of Seletar. Loke added that Singapore should installed the ILS facing south of Seletar for Runway 03 instead of facing north towards Malaysia, for Runway 21 at Seletar airport. On 13 December 2018 Singapore denied that the Seletar ILS placed compulsory height restrictions in Pasir Gudang and that Malaysia sovereignty over Pasir Gudang airspace was never questioned by Singapore, being the party delegated by Malaysia to manage that airspace since 1973 and agreed by both countries and approved by the ICAO. Singapore also stated that based on historical meteorological patterns, the Seletar and Pasir Gudang regions faced opposing wind directions for each half of a year, thus singular directional approach and take-off procedures via Seletar's Runway 03 only will render flight operations unsafe. Numerous experts have since pointed out that with the ILS in place, it will help the pilots to land properly and safely and will not impose any compulsory height restrictions. In that video Loke Siew Fook had stated that at 3,000m from Seletar airport, there is a height restriction of 54m compulsorily enforced by the ILS on building heights in Pasir Gudang, while at 6,000m the height restriction is 145m, where \\"\\"this means, even a mobile crane would have breached the height limit and there are many tall buildings in Johor\\". On 12 December 2018, Singapore countered by stating that at 3,000m from Seletar airport, the bare height limit, without a safety buffer zone, is 93.8m while at 6,000m, it is 193.1m, while at a 25 km mark from Seletar, at Air Tawar or Kota Tinggi, the height limit exceeds 1,000m high. Since the ILS has a safety buffer zone, the height at 3,000m from Seletar airport is 2005m, while at 6,000m it will be 401m, and at Air Tawar and Kota Tinggi, the height will be 1,066.8m or about 200m higher than the height of Burj Khalifa in Dubai at 829.8m or more than twice higher than the Petronas Twin Towers at 452m. Singapore explained that a descending plane approaching Seletar Runway 21 at a 3.5-degree glide slope will be at a height of 183.5m at 3,000m from Seletar and 366m high at the 6,000m mark while at 25 km away in the Air Tawar and Kota Tinggi region, incoming aircraft into Seletar airport will be at a minimum height of 1,066.8m or 3,500 feet. With a safety buffer zone under the ILS glide path, the height of a descending aircraft at the 3,000m mark from Seletar is increased to 200.1m which is the same height before the ILS comes into operation on 3 January 2019, and that the glide path and height limits are in accordance with safety and operational standards required by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which both Malaysia and Singapore had ratified. Singapore said that all existing tall buildings directly below the current Seletar glide path have been taken into account in the design of the ILS procedures and that the Singapore authorities have not been informed of any new developments being planned in Pasir Gudang that could significantly affect the flight profile for Seletar flights. Malaysia have not obligation to inform any future developments in Pasir Gudang to Singapore as these do not affect any Singapore sovereignty. The current Seletar airport glide path over Pasir Gudang passes over the Johor Port Pasir Gudang Container Terminal where eight gantry cranes, each exceeding 90m high or equivalent to a 30-storey building, are in operation and it also passes over the TNB Sultan Iskandar Power Station with a smoke chimney exceeding 125m. Both the cranes and the chimney (completed in 1980) are located on the Pasir Gudang shorelines of the Johor Straits and located directly north of Seletar Airport under the glide path and these tall structures are clearly indicated in the Seletar Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) and Instrument landing system (ILS) charts published by CAAS on 1 December 2018 as well as in the Visual approach charts for Seletar airport. Under ICAO regulations, countries with adjacent air boundaries are required to provide early notification of proposed future developments to all relevant parties so that flight procedures can be adjusted if necessary and Singapore will make operational adjustments for any future development plans involving tall buildings in Pasir Gudang and all affected areas under the ILS glide path into Seletar.  Higher Risk For Pasir Gudang  Singapore assured Malaysia that for more than three decades, the republic has safely managed flight operations and ships transiting the Johor Strait to and from ports and marine facilities in Pasir Gudang region and in this regard, Singapore had installed the Vessel Height Measuring System (VHMS) to safeguard both aviation and maritime activities which, and on occasions, had flights been delayed while tall vessels crossed the Strait of Johor safely. The VHMS protocol had been in operation since 1986 and was also presented by the CAAS to the ICAO on 17 August 2011. Singapore further stated that the Seletar ILS procedure is meant to enhance the safety of the existing flight operations over Pasir Gudang and it does not create a new flight path that differs or deviates from the current air corridor that had been in operations since 1974. =Other Airlines Affected: Berjaya Air And Malindo Air= Besides Firefly, two other airlines, Berjaya Air and Malindo Air, are not expected to start their Malaysia-Seletar routes until both airlines had received permission from the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia to use Seletar airport. On 14 December 2018, Malaysia said that enough had been said publicly and that technical and aviation experts from both sides should be given space to solve any technical issues, hence Malaysia requested for bilateral meeting promptly with Singapore. =Pasir Gudang Airspace Declared As Restricted Military Area= On 25 December 2018, Malaysia declared that the air space over Pasir Gudang is a restricted area for the purpose of military activities which shall go into effect on 2 January 2019. CAAM had published a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) on 25 December 2018 that informed the aviation community of its establishment of a permanent restricted area. Singapore Ministry of Transport said the restricted area, being within a controlled and congested airspace, will impact the existing and normal operations of aircraft transiting through the airspace.

The base motto is Dare and Will. History =RAF Sembawang= Before Singapore's independence from the United Kingdom, it was a Royal Air Force station known as RAF Sembawang as well as being the Royal Naval Air Station ‚Äì HMS Simbang ‚Äì to the carrier pilots of the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm (attached to the Eastern Fleet based in Singapore) who used it for rest and refit whenever an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy berthed at the nearby HMNB Singapore for refuel and repairs, which also housed the largest Royal Navy dockyard east of Suez up to the time of UK forces withdrawal from Singapore. After the Japanese capture of Singapore during World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service took over the two RAF stations of Sembawang and Seletar. Singapore was split into north‚Äìsouth spheres of control, and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force took over RAF Tengah. It was not until September 1945 that the two airfields reverted to British control following the Japanese surrender. RAF Sembawang was a key part of Britain's continued military presence in the Far East (along with the three other RAF bases in Singapore: RAF Changi, RAF Seletar, RAF Tengah) during the critical period of the Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960), the Brunei Revolt in 1962 and the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation (1962‚Äì1966). =Units= 1941‚Äì42 * No. 62 Squadron RAF (detachment) ‚Äì Bristol Blenheim I. * No. 21 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) ‚Äì Brewster Buffalo * No. 453 Squadron RAAF ‚Äì Brewster Buffalo I. 1945‚Äì1971 Royal Air Force * No. 28 Squadron RAF ‚Äì Supermarine Spitfire FR.18. * No. 60 Squadron RAF ‚Äì Spitfire F.18. * No. 194 Squadron RAF reformed here during February 1953 from the Far East Casevac Flight ‚Äì Westland Dragonfly HC.2. * No. 656 Squadron RAF reformed here on 29 June 1948 from No. 1914 Flight RAF ‚Äì Auster AOP.5.

Biography After Gomez was born, his parents decided to abandon Cuba, perhaps to allow his son to live under better economic conditions. The Gomez family arrived in Puerto Rico. Salsa music had been popularized in Cuba by Celia Cruz, Olga Guillot and others, and, in Puerto Rico, it shared the general public's top spot among favorite types of music with American rock and pop music. Such stars such as El Gran Combo and Eddie Santiago were famous during the 1980s there. Gomez started to become interested in this type of music since he was a child, demonstrating ability to dance it from his early years. Gomez tried to continue learning and practicing his dance moves as a teenager, after he had moved to Miami. Later, he went into the army and was stationed in Germany. After getting out of the Army, he worked for a while in Germany until he eventually settled in Rome, Italy. Salsa is a growing music genre in Europe; Andy Monta√±ez, another Puerto Rican star of the 1970s and 1980s, toured Belgium, Spain and other countries, for example. Gomez, basking in Salsa's new popularity in that continent, set a dancing school there. Soon, Gomez became one of the best known dancing teachers in Europe, in part because people from Italy and other countries wanted to learn how to dance Salsa. Gomez has popularized the Puerto Rican and New York City dancing styles, among others, in Italy as well as in other countries such as England and Denmark. He has also taught at schools in Muslim countries (particularly in northern Africa) as well as in South Africa.

The popular President Theodore Roosevelt had easily ensured himself of the nomination; a threat had come from the Old Guard favourite Ohio Senator Mark Hanna, the loyal kingmaker in Republican politics, but he died early in 1904, which ended any opposition to Roosevelt within the Republican Party. There were also very informal talks with future president William Howard Taft about trying for the nomination, but Taft refused these motions as evidenced by a letter to Henry Hoyt, the Solicitor General, in 1903. Roosevelt was nominated by 994 votes to none, while the only other serious opponent to Roosevelt, Indiana Senator Charles W. Fairbanks, was nominated for vice president by acclaimation. Platform Speaker of the House Joseph Gurney Cannon at the convention. The 1904 Republican platform favored the protective tariff, increased foreign trade, the gold standard, expansion of the Merchant Marine and strengthening of the United States Navy; it also praised Roosevelt's foreign and domestic policies. Vice Presidential candidates Vice President Roosevelt had ascended to the presidency in 1901 after the death of President William McKinley. As the 25th Amendment had not yet been passed, there was no way to fill the vice presidential vacancy. So the 1904 convention had the task of choosing a running mate for Roosevelt. Entering the convention, Senator Charles Fairbanks of Indiana was considered the likely favorite for the vice presidential nomination, but the Roosevelt administration favored Illinois Representative Robert R. Hitt or Secretary of War William Howard Taft of Ohio. Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon of Illinois also had support among the delegates, but Cannon had no desire to leave his position in the House. However, the administration did not launch a fight over the nomination of Fairbanks, and Fairbanks was nominated by acclamation. Speakers There were significantly fewer speakers at the 1904 convention then there are at a typical convention today. This is because the convention at the time was much lower in viewership (as there were not the mass media devices of TV or radio at this time only those actually invited saw it). Also, this was before the primary era so the delegates were expected to nominate the candidate at the actual convention as well as more typical tasks such as electing the chairman and handling other business which varies in importance at the Republican Convention today.

He is a major scholar in the scholarship on the historical Jesus and contributed to the view that Jesus was part of a renewal movement within Judaism. He has been Arts and Sciences Professor of Religion at Duke University, North Carolina, since 1990. He retired in 2005. Sanders is a Fellow of the British Academy. In 1966 he received a Doctor of Theology degree from Union Theological Seminary in New York City. In 1990 he received a Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Oxford and a Doctor of Theology degree from the University of Helsinki. He has authored, co-authored or edited 13 books and numerous articles. He has received a number of prizes, including the 1990 University of Louisville and Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary Grawemeyer Award for the best book on religion published in the 1980s for Jesus and Judaism.  Biography  Sanders was born on April 18, 1937, in Grand Prairie, Texas. He attended Texas Wesleyan College (1955‚Äì1959) and Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University (1959‚Äì1962). He spent a year (1962‚Äì1963) studying at G√∂ttingen, the University of Oxford, and in Jerusalem. Between September 1963 and May 1966 Sanders studied at Union Theological Seminary, New York City, for his Doctor of Theology degree. His thesis was entitled The Tendencies of the Synoptic Tradition (published in 1969), which used form criticism to examine whether the Gospel tradition changed in consistent ways. The thesis was supervised by W. D. Davies. He taught at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario) from 1966 to 1984. In 1968 he won a fellowship from the Canada Council and spent a year in Israel, studying Rabbinic Judaism. In 1984, he became Dean Ireland's Professor of the Exegesis of Holy Scripture at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Queen's College, positions he kept until his move to Duke University in 1990. He has also held visiting professorships and lectureships at Trinity College, Dublin, and the University of Cambridge. Sanders identifies himself as a \\"liberal, modern, secularized Protestant\\" in his book Jesus and Judaism; fellow scholar John P. Meier calls him a postliberal Protestant. In any case, he is cognizant of Albert Schweitzer's indictment of liberal theology's attempt to make Jesus in its own image, and seeks to keep his religious convictions out of his scholarship.  Thought and writings  Sanders is known for his New Testament scholarship. His field of special interest is Judaism and Christianity in the Greco-Roman world. He is one of the leading scholars in contemporary historical Jesus research, the so- called \\"third quest,\\" which places Jesus firmly in the context of Judaism.Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). Chapter 1. The quest of the historical Jesus. p. 1‚Äì15. In contemporary scholarship, Jesus is seen as the founder of a \\"renewal movement within Judaism,\\" to use Sanders' phrase. He promotes the predominant view that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet. Sanders' first major book was Paul and Palestinian Judaism, which was published in 1977. He had written the book by 1975, but had difficulty in having it published. Sanders argued that the traditional Christian interpretation that Paul was condemning Rabbinic legalism was a misunderstanding of both Judaism and Paul's thought, especially since it assumed a level of individualism in these doctrines that was not present, and disregarded notions of group benefit or collective privilege. Rather, Sanders argued, the key difference between pre-Christian Judaism and Pauline teaching was to be found in ideas of how a person becomes one of the People of God. Sanders termed the Jewish belief \\"covenantal nomism\\": one was a member of the people by virtue of God's covenant with Abraham, and one stayed in it by keeping the Law. Sanders claimed that Paul's belief was one of participationist eschatology: the only way to become one of the People of God was through faith in Christ (\\"dying with Christ\\") and the Old Covenant was no longer sufficient. But, once inside, appropriate behavior was required of the Christian, behavior based on the Jewish Scriptures, but not embracing all aspects of it. Both patterns required the grace of God for election (admission), and the behavior of the individual, supported by God's grace. The dividing line, therefore, was Paul's insistence on faith in Christ as the only way to election. However, Sanders stressed that Paul also \\"loved good deeds\\" and that when his words are taken in context, it emerges that Paul advocates good works in addition to faith in Christ. Sanders' next major book was Jesus and Judaism, published in 1985. In this work he argued that Jesus began as a follower of John the Baptist and was a prophet of the restoration of Israel. Sanders saw Jesus as creating an eschatological Jewish movement through his appointment of the Apostles and through his preaching and actions. After his execution (the trigger for which was Jesus overthrowing the tables in the temple court of Herod's Temple, thereby antagonizing the political authorities) his followers continued the movement, expecting his return to restore Israel. One consequence of this return would involve Gentiles worshiping the god of Israel. Sanders could find no substantial points of opposition between Jesus and the Pharisees, and he viewed Jesus as abiding by Jewish law and the disciples as continuing to keep it (cf. e.g., Acts 3:1; 21:23‚Äì26, for their worship in the Temple). Sanders also argues that Jesus' sayings did not entirely determine Early Christian behavior and attitudes, as is shown by Paul's discussion of divorce (1 Cor. 7:10‚Äì16) where the latter quotes Jesus' sayings and then gives his own independent ruling. In one interview, Sanders stated that Paul felt that \\"he was the model to his churches.\\" Judaism: Practice and Belief was published in 1992 and tested Sanders' thesis in the light of concrete Jewish practices. Sanders argued that there was a \\"Common Judaism\\", that is, beliefs and practices common to all Jews, regardless of which religious party they belonged to. After the reign of Salome Alexandra, the Pharisees were a small but very respected party which had a varying amount of influence within Judaism. The main source of power, however, was with the rulers and especially the aristocratic priesthood (Sadducees). Sanders argues that the evidence indicates that the Pharisees did not dictate policy to any of these groups or individuals. In general, Sanders stressed the importance of historical context for a proper understanding of first century religion. He attempted to approach Judaism on its own terms, not in the context of the Protestant‚ÄìCatholic debates of the sixteenth century in order to redefine views on Judaism, Paul, and Christianity as a whole. As Sanders said, he reads Paul in his context, which is \\"Palestine in the first century and especially first century Judaism.\\" In this spirit, one of Sanders' articles is titled \\"Jesus in Historical Context\\".located at http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/oct1993/v50-3-article8.htm In a 2000 encyclopedia entry on Jesus whom Sanders calls an 'eschatological prophet', the subject avoids the word 'angel' although mention is made of the two men 'in dazzling clothes' at the empty tomb.Sanders, E.P. (2000). \\"Jesus Christ\\" in Freedman, David ed. Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible. Grand Rapids, Mich.:W.B. Eerdmans, pp. 701‚Äì707. Sanders has argued that more comparative studies are needed, with wider examinations conducted between New Testament texts and the other available historical sources of the period. Speaking at a conference organized in his honor, he described the attractiveness of these types of comparative studies: \\"They are not all that easy, but they are an awful lot of fun.\\"  Selected works  =Books=        =Articles and Chapters=   * Festschrift *  References   Further reading    External links  *E.

Groundbreaking took place on 15 July 2002 and it was officially opened on 29 November 2004. The runway (02R/20L) length was approximately 2,748 metres (9,015 ft), it has since been lengthened to 4,000 metres. Location The new base houses the Republic of Singapore Air Force's 145 Squadron, which comprises the extended- range, attack-oriented F-16D Block 52+ Fighting Falcons, as well as the 208 Squadron, the 808 Squadron and the 508 Squadron. The proximity of the South China Sea to the air base gives it an advantage over Tengah Air Base and Paya Lebar Air Base as the F-16 jets from Changi can make a faster and shorter trip out to training areas over the South China Sea, compared to their counterparts from other air bases. The 145 Squadron can save as much as five to seven minutes of transit time, which means they also save on fuel and further reducing costs. In the future, the runway will be extended to 4,000 metres to accommodate further growth in passenger, cargo and air traffic as construction of Terminal 5 gets underway. As part of Changi Airport's expansion and to accommodate the eventual relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase, the air base was closed for expansion works and re-opened at the end of 2018. Organisation * 112 Sqn 6 Airbus A330 MRTT (Aerial refuelling) *145 Squadron with 20 F-16D Blk 52+ (Strike) Singapore Airshow Also, located just beyond the northern edge perimeter fencing of the air base is the permanent venue of the new Changi Exhibition Centre for the Singapore Airshow which was completed in September 2007 and had hosted the recently inaugurated Singapore Airshow 2008 in February 2008. The most recent Airshow was held from 11‚Äì16 February 2020. 40th Anniversary of Five Power Defence Arrangements On 1 November 2011, Singapore hosted the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA)'s 40th-anniversary celebrations, with the defence ministers, aircraft and servicemen from all five signatory countries converging on the air base to participate in the event. Amongst the participating aircraft spotted roosting at the dispersal area of the air base were Republic of Singapore Air Force's F-15SG Strike Eagle, Royal Air Force's Typhoon FGR4, Royal Australian Air Force's F/A-18A Hornets, Royal Malaysian Air Force's F/A-18D Hornets and Royal New Zealand Air Force's P-3K2 Orions. Later, a gala dinner was hosted by Singapore's defence minister - Dr Ng Eng Hen at Singapore's Istana whereupon they called on the Prime Minister of Singapore - Mr Lee Hsien Loong to discuss a multitude of issues. Codenamed Exercise Bersama Lima, the three days joint exercise is expected to test the readiness and cooperation between all participating countries and should conclude on 4 November 2011.

They are widely found in tropical or subtropical water in Asia, Oceania and Africa. They are filter- feeders and omnivorous scavengers. They range from 0.9‚Äì9.8 mm (C. cantonensis) to 1.2‚Äì7.4 mm (C. serrata) in carapace length. Taxonomy and species Caridina serratirostris, a widespread freshwater species from the Indo-Pacific region Caridina dennerli, one of several species restricted to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Caridina cantonensis is widely kept in aquariums and several color forms have been achieved through selective breeding There is evidence for hybridization between sympatric taxa, requiring care when interpreting molecular phylogenetic analyses that do not use a large number of specimens.

He was the father of Moses and David Kimhi, and the teacher of Rabbi Menachem Ben Simeon and poet Joseph Zabara. Grammarian, exegete, poet, and translator; born in southern Spain about 1105; died about 1170. Forced to leave his native country owing to the religious persecutions of the Almohades, who invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 1146, he settled in Narbonne, Provence, where he spent the rest of his life. The Hachmei Provence were under the considerable influence of the neighboring Spanish Jewish community to the south at the time. Qim·∏•i is known to have written commentaries on all the books of the Bible, though only fragments of his work have survived until today. The foundation of his work is a literal reading of the Masoretic Text (\\"ùï∏\\") and its grammatical analysis, interspersed with contemporary philosophical musings. This reflects his opposition to a christological reading of the text, which highlights allegory. In fact, Kimhi participated in several public debates with Catholic clergy, in which he highlighted his own method of reading biblical texts. His opposition to the contemporary Christian reading can be found in his Book of the Covenant (). His son David, though but a child at the time of his father's death, may also be considered one of his pupils, either directly through his works, or indirectly through the instruction David received from his elder brother Moses. Relations with Ibn Ezra Abraham ibn Ezra, who in his wanderings visited Narbonne in 1160, may have possibly met Joseph. The latter followed Ibn Ezra in some particulars, e.g., in the use of the stem for the paradigm of the verb. Both scholars worked at the same time and along the same lines to popularize Judeo-Arabic science among the Jews of Christian Europe by excerpting from and translating Arabic works. Although ibn Ezra was Qim·∏•i's superior in knowledge, the latter can rightly claim to have been the first successful transplanter of Judeo- Arabic science in the soil of Christian Europe. His diction is elegant and lucid, the disposition of his material scientific, his treatment of his subject even and without digressions; so that his works are much better adapted for study than those of Ibn Ezra, which lack all these qualifications. Relations with Rabbeinu Tam Another famous contemporary of Qim·∏•i was Jacob ibn Me√Ør, called Rabbeinu Tam, of Ramerupt, who was the greatest Talmudic authority of the day. This scholar, wishing to settle the literary quarrel between the followers of Menahem ben Saruq and of Dunash ben Labra·π≠, had written a book of decisions ( hakhra ªot), in which he took the part of Menahem. These decisions did not satisfy Qim·∏•i. Feeling himself better able than Rabbeinu Tam to pass judgment in the case, he wrote the Sefer ha-Galui in 1165. This work falls into two parts: the first treats the differences between Menahem and Dunash; the second contains independent criticisms on the former's dictionary. In the introduction, Qim·∏•i apologizes for daring to come forward against so eminent a man as the leading Talmudic authority of his time. Hearing that the ignorant among the people will attack him on that account, he puts into their mouths the words which Abner, the captain of Saul, spoke, when David cried out to the king: \\"Who art thou that criest to the king?\\" ('I Sam. 26,14'). His fears were realized; Benjamin of Canterbury, a pupil of Rabbeinu Tam, made observations on the Sefer ha-Galui, defending his teacher. He also called Qim·∏•i in a contemptuous sense HaQore \\"The Crier\\" because the latter ventured to cry his contradictions to the \\"king,\\" i.e., Rabbeinu Tam. Grammarian and Lexicographer In Qim·∏•i's grammatical works Sefer Zikkaron (edited by Bacher, Berlin, 1888) and Sefer haGalui (edited by Matthews, ib. 1887) he is dependent on Judah ben David Hayyuj for the treatment of his subject, but in his explanations of words he relies mainly on Jonah ibn Janah. On the whole, he is not original; in minor points, however, he goes his own way, becoming therein the model for future generations. Thus he was the first to recognize that the hif'il has also a reflexive and an intransitive meaning; he was also the first to arrange a list of nominal forms, to indicate eight verb classes, and to classify the vowels into a system of five short and five long ones. In his works he pays frequent attention also to the language of the liturgy. In his etymological explanations he seeks for analogies in Bible, Talmud, Targum, and in Arabic. In cases where such analogies are wanting or unsatisfactory he is guided by the principle, \\"The unknown must be deduced from the known.\\" Not seldom he explains difficult words on the basis of phonetic laws laid down by himself. Exegete Of his exegetical works few have been preserved. Mention is made of his Sefer hatTorah, a commentary on the Torah; his Sefer hamMi·∏≥nah, a commentary on the Nevi'im; and his ·∏§ibbur halLe·∏≥e·π≠ of unknown contents. A commentary by him on the Song of Songs exists in manuscript; his commentary on the Book of Proverbs has been published by Dob B√§r ans Dubrowo under the title Sefer ·∏§uqqah (Breslau, 1868); and variants to the badly printed text are given by Eppenstein in Zeit. f√ºr Hebr. Bibl. v. 143 et seq. A fragment of his commentary on the Book of Job has been published by Schwarz in his Tiqwat Enosh (Berlin, 1868); the remaining portions, by Eppenstein in \\"R. E. J.\\" xxxvii. 86 et seq. Many exegetical remarks are scattered throughout Qim·∏•i's grammatical works. His method is mostly that of the pesha·π≠, i.e., literal interpretation. He frequently follows the Spanish school, without, however, reading into the Scriptural text the scientific knowledge of his own time. He pays a great deal of attention to the context, a point usually neglected by Aggadists. His explanations are short and terse. While criticizing at times some untenable explanations of his predecessors, he accepts such as seem to him to be correct. He is the first eclectic of the Hachmei Provence. Poet ·∏≤im·∏•i tried his hand also at writing poetry. His liturgical hymns and other poems which have come down are indeed distinguished by beauty of form and elegance of language. In spirit, however, they can not be compared with the works of the great Spanish Hebrew language poets. Nevertheless, he retains importance as one of the Proven√ßal poets. His poems met with consideration at the hands of later generations and were frequently quoted by them. He is the first known author to write poems in the Magen Avot genre, and apparently is the inventor of the genre, which later became popular in Germany. Translator He translated Bahya ibn Paquda's ethical work Hobot halLebabot from Arabic into Hebrew, and he turned Solomon ibn Gabirol's Mib·∏•ar hapPeninim into metrical form under the title Sheqel haqQodesh. Of the translation, only a fragment has been preserved, which was published by Jellinek in Benjacob's edition of ibn Tibbon's translation of that work (Leipsic, 1846); the \\"Sheqel\\" is still unprinted. In his translation, aiming chiefly at elegance of expression, ·∏≤im·∏•i does not keep to the original. He works too independently and, carrying into the work his own spirit, he often obscures the thought of the author. Notwithstanding its defects, his translation is not without merit. It has contributed to a better understanding of the Arabic authors, and is, therefore, to be considered in a certain sense as supplementing the works of the Tibbonides. Apologete Finally mention must be made of ·∏≤im·∏•i's apologetic work \\"Sefer ha-Berit,\\" which contributed to Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages, though it was not printed until a fragment was published in \\"Mil·∏•emet ·∏§obah\\" (Constantinople, 1710). This work was written at the request of one of his pupils who wished to have a collection of all the prophetic passages in Scripture that might serve as aids in refuting those persons who denied the Torah. It is in the form of a dialogue between a loyal Jew and an apostate. The loyal Jew claims that the true religion of the Jew may be recognized by the moral conduct of the individual; all Jews are intent on carrying out in their lives the Decalogue; they give no divine honors to any one besides God; do not perjure themselves; commit no murder; and are not robbers. Their children are educated in the fear of God; their women are chaste; the Jews are hospitable toward one another, perform works of charity, and redeem captives‚Äîall virtues which are not found in such a high degree among non-Jews. The apostate admits all these claims, but points out that Jews demand high interest on loans. This objection the loyal Jew meets with the statement that non-Jews also are usurers, and that they impose upon members of their own faith, while rich Jews lend money to their coreligionists without any interest whatever. The \\"Sefer ha-Berit\\" is of importance as showing the moral condition of the Jews at that time, and as bearing testimony to the conditions of those days, in which the Jews in the Provence could freely express themselves not only with regard to their own religion, but also with regard to the religion of their neighbors.

As a result of notoriety surrounding the sale of the house where the crimes occurred, the NSW government made it illegal to not disclose information related to the history of a property. Background Sef Gonzales was born in 1980 in Baguio, Benguet, Philippines to Teddy Gonzales, a lawyer, and his wife Loiva who had married in 1977. In 1983, his sister Clodine was born. After the 1990 Luzon earthquake destroyed the family's home and business, a newly built 40-room hotel (from which Gonzales was rescued from the rubble by his father), the family emigrated to Australia. The family settled in Sydney, and by the late 1990s, Teddy had requalified as a lawyer, set up a successful law firm, began working as an immigration lawyer, and purchased a plot of land in North Ryde. The family appeared to be close-knit: the parents, however, were devout Catholics who, as tiger parents, had high hopes and strict expectations for their children. In particular, they had hoped their son would perform well academically, give up his musical and singing aspirations, and embark on a career in medicine or law. After attending Parramatta Marist High School, Gonzales studied medical science at the University of New South Wales but withdrew after two years. He then enrolled in law at Macquarie University. Performing poorly in his courses and at risk of expulsion, Gonzales tried to cover up his failure by falsifying his grades. When this was revealed by his sister to his parents, they threatened to withdraw certain privileges such as the use of his prized car, a green Ford Festiva. Gonzales also argued with his mother over a girlfriend of whom she disapproved, and his family threatened to disinherit him. This, along with Gonzales's desire to inherit the family's assets, were later established by police as motives for killing his family. The murders On 10 July 2001, at about 4:00p.m., Gonzales left the family's law firm, where he worked part-time, and headed to the family home. Around 4:30 pm, armed with a baseball bat from his car and with two kitchen knives from a knife block in the kitchen, he entered Clodine's bedroom and assaulted her while she was studying. There he compressed her neck while trying to strangle her, struck her head with the bat at least six times, and then stabbed her multiple times with the smaller of the knives. The cause of Clodine's death was a combination of the compression of her neck, blunt force head injuries, and abdominal stab wounds. Gonzales then waited until Loiva arrived home about 5:30p.m. After entering the house, Gonzales attacked her with one of the kitchen knives in the living/dining room. Gonzales inflicted multiple stab wounds and cuts to her face, neck, chest and abdomen. Her windpipe was then completely transected post-mortem. At around 6:00 pm, Gonzales's maternal aunt visited the house. She noted her nephew's and sister's cars in the driveway, but the house was dark and unusually quiet (especially given that the family kept six small dogs inside). Looking into the house, she noticed movement, and left with her son after deciding not to enter via the garage. Teddy then arrived home about 6.50pm. After entering the house, Gonzales attacked him with one of the kitchen knives and inflicted multiple stab wounds to his neck, chest, back and abdomen. One of the stab wounds penetrated his right lung, another penetrated his heart and another partially severed his spinal cord. Teddy sustained defensive wounds, suggesting that there was a struggle. After killing his family, Gonzales disposed of the murder weapons and the clothing and the size 7 running shoes he was wearing at the time of the murders. He showered, changed clothes, and spray painted the words \\"Fuck off Asians\\" on a wall in the house in an attempt to fool investigating police into believing that his family had been the victims of a hate crime. Gonzales then drove to a friend's house, arriving there about 8:00 pm. The two then went to the Sydney CBD, where they ate at Planet Hollywood and visited a nearby video game arcade. Later in the evening, after dropping his friend off, Gonzales returned home. He called emergency services at 11:48 pm to say he had discovered the bodies. Gonzales had also frantically run to his neighbours' house and told them that his parents had been shot. Investigation In the days following the murders, Gonzales appeared on television asking for the killers to come forward, saying he wanted justice and offering a reward of $100,000. A few days after the murder, Gonzales visited the family's accountant, enquiring about his inheritance (estimated at $1.5m in Australia and $1.3m in The Philippines). As an apparent victim of crime, he was also eligible for a $15,000 payout. Gonzales then moved to an apartment in Chatswood and put a deposit on a $173,000 Lexus, telling the dealership he would be using his inheritance to pay for the vehicle. It was also claimed at trial that he traded in his parents' cars and pawned his mother's jewellery. Gonzales also told relatives that he had a brain tumour and asked his godmother in the Philippines for $190,000 for the alleged surgery, but she did not give him any money. On 20 July, at the combined family funeral, he gave the eulogy and sang \\"One Sweet Day\\" which some attendees found odd. Based on the initial evidence, NSW Police investigators assumed that the murders were part of a robbery attempt. However, given the absence of a forced entry and despite some superficial ransacking, nothing of value was missing, including the cash in the victims' possession. Also, given the 3-hour duration of the crimes it was deemed unlikely that thieves would remain in the house for that long. After noticing an emotional detachment and many inconsistencies in Gonzales' story, such as his claims of performing CPR, and no evidence of any intruders, police began to suspect that he was involved. Gonzales' clothes, for example, were found to have the same paint used in the graffiti scrawl and a shoe box in his room matched the shoes used in the attack. Based on this, his internet records were searched, his phone calls began to be recorded, and he was befriended and surveilled by an undercover policeman. In December 2001, police were able to disprove Gonzales' first alibi, that he waited in his car in the driveway before driving to another suburb and later meeting his friend on the night of the murders. Gonzales then constructed a second alibi, claiming he had taken a taxi (as his car may have been recognised) and visited a brothel at the time of the murders, but this was discredited by both the supposed taxi driver and the sex worker. Other false trails included the fabrication of an e-mail that implicated a business rival of Teddy in the murders and the staging of an attempted burglary on 30 May. A breakthrough came when his fingerprint was matched to a series of product poisoning letters which matched address searches on his PC. Other evidence indicated his research into poisons, the ordering of toxic-plant seeds, and recent unexplained poisoning-like illnesses in his family. On 13 June 2002, detectives from Strike Force Tawas arrested Gonzales. Legal proceedings Gonzales was charged with three counts of murder and one count of threatening product contamination. He was refused bail and held on remand in Silverwater Correctional Centre. During this time, he was denied access to the family's estate to fund his defence, and sought legal aid for the murder trial which took place during April and May 2004. Prosecuted by Mark Tedeschi, the trial revealed that Gonzales had planned the murders for several months before they took place. Initially Gonzales researched the idea of poisoning his family, which led to an elaborate contamination hoax one week before the killings. The court heard of numerous lies told to his friends, family and police regarding his whereabouts at the time of the murders, suggesting that Gonzales was a pathological liar. It was found that he had committed the murders because he was fearful that, because of his poor performance in his university studies, his parents might take his car away from him and might withdraw other privileges which had been granted to him and that he wished to be the sole beneficiary of his parents' property. On 20 May 2004, he was found guilty of all four charges. He was sentenced on 17 September 2004 to three concurrent life sentences without parole for the murders, Justice Bruce James remarked that \\"I consider that the murders show features of very great heinousness and that there are no facts mitigating the objective seriousness of the murders and hence the murders fall within the worst category of cases of murder at common law.\\" In June 2007, Gonzales was granted approval to appeal his conviction and his sentence. The Supreme Court determined that statements taken from Gonzales by police on the night of the murders may be inadmissible, as he was not cautioned. On 27 November 2007, the appeal was dismissed as there had been no miscarriage of justice, and his convictions remained. As of 2020, Gonzales maintains his innocence and continues to serve his sentence at the Goulburn Correctional Centre. House sale The North Ryde house, located at 6 Collins Street and built by the Gonzales in 2000, was put on the market shortly after the murders but due to its notoriety, it remained unsold for three years. Its eventual sale aroused controversy in October 2004 when prospective buyers, a couple from Taiwan, agreed to purchase the property. However, they had not been informed of the events that took place there by the realtors, LJ Hooker, only finding them out from a newspaper. LJ Hooker initially refused to reverse the sale as they had no legal obligation of disclosure, but eventually refunded the buyers' $80,000 deposit due to the bad publicity it caused. The company was also fined $21,000 by the NSW Office of Fair Trading. After this incident, the NSW government made it illegal to \\"fail to disclose information that could have a substantial impact on the value of a property\\". In November 2005, the house was sold for $720,000 ($80,000 less than the previous price) to a buyer who was informed of its history.

According to A. C. Ward, the work argues that \\"cultured, leisured Europe\\" was drifting toward destruction, and that \\"Those in a position to guide Europe to safety failed to learn their proper business of political navigation\\".Shaw, Bernard. Heartbreak House A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes. With an Introduction and notes by Ward, A.C. London: Longmans Green and Co Ltd. 1961, p.164 The \\"Russian manner\\" of the subtitle refers to the style of Anton Chekhov, which Shaw adapts. Characters *Ellie Dunn *Nurse Guinness *Captain Shotover *Lady Utterword *Hesione Hushabye *Mazzini Dunn *Hector Hushabye *Boss Alfred Mangan *Randall Utterword *Burglar (Billy Dunn) Plot summary Ellie Dunn, her father, and her fianc√© are invited to one of Hesione Hushabye‚Äôs infamous dinner parties, to be held at the house of her father, the eccentric Captain Shotover, an inventor in his late eighties who is trying to create a \\"psychic ray\\" that will destroy dynamite. The house is built in the shape of the stern of a ship. Lady Utterword, Shotover's other daughter, arrives from Australia, but he pretends not to recognise her. Hesione says they are running out of money. Shotover needs to invent a weapon of mass destruction. His last invention, a lifeboat, did not bring in much cash. Ellie intends to marry businessman Boss Mangan, but she really loves a man she met in the National Gallery. Unfortunately, her fianc√© is a ruthless scoundrel, her father's a bumbling prig, and it turns out that the man she's in love with is Hector, Hesione's husband, who spends his time telling romantic lies to women. Marriage to Mangan will be the sensible choice. A burglar is captured. They say they do not want to prosecute him, but he insists he will turn himself in unless they pay him not to. It turns out that the burglar is one of Shotover's old crewmen. He confesses that he is not a real burglar. He deliberately gets himself captured to get charitable assistance from his victims. Shotover laments that the younger generation have lost their romance. Ellie suggests that she should marry Shotover, but he says he's already married to a black Jamaican wife, though it's possible she's now dead. Lady Utterword says that everything will be put to right if only they get some horses. Every English family should have horses. Mangan declares that he is to head a government department, but Ellie suddenly announces that she cannot marry him as she is now Shotover's \\"white wife\\". Shotover predicts that the ship of England will founder, as the captain is drunk and the crew are all gambling. The maid enters with news that an air-raid is about to happen. The lights are switched off, but Hector switches them back on to demonstrate his lack of concern about the threat. A bomb lands in the garden, blowing up Shotover's store of dynamite and killing Mangan and the burglar who were hiding there. When it is over everyone says how bored they are. They hope the bombs will come again tomorrow. Relation to Chekhov In the preface to the play Shaw acknowledges his debt to Chekhov, in particular to The Cherry Orchard. He writes that in comparison to himself, Chekhov was \\"more of a fatalist, had no faith in these charming people extricating themselves. They would, he thought, be sold up and sent adrift by the bailiffs; therefore he had no scruple in exploiting and even flattering their charm.\\"David Krasner, History of Modern Drama, Volume: 1, Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, 2012, p.187. Critics have taken very different views about Shaw's adaptation of Chekhov. Louis Kronenberger says that Shaw \\"turns Chekhov into a sort of literary Hyde Park soapbox dialectic for the theatre...We should be brow-beaten indeed to accept the idea that in Heartbreak House there is more than the merest hint or tiny reflection of Chekhov's true method, none of that pure, pains-taking economy and drawing, none of that humility of vision, none of that shy certainty of intuition. And Mr. Shaw's play has none of the variety in emotional rhythm that Chekhov's has, either in tone or in profound self-revelation among the characters.\\"Louis Kronenberger, George Bernard Shaw: A Critical Survey, World Publishing, Cleveland, OH, 1953, p.234 Louis Crompton, in contrast, says that, Thomas Whitaker says that Shaw differs markedly from Chekhov by presenting his characters as mercurial \\"rhetorical puppets\\" which gives them a \\"surprisingly rich vitality... a heartbroken adolescent can instantly become a cynic on the prowl, a maternal confidante can also be a seductive hostess and an emasculating wife, a philandering lapdog can be a shrewd judge of character and an offstage hero, and a mad hatter can be a mad Lear and a mad Shaw.\\"T. Whitaker, Fields of Play in Modern Drama, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1977, pp.90-1. Major themes =Society= The house could arguably be a metaphorical reference to a ship which must be guided capably, not only by its crew, but also its passengers. Each character in the house represents to some degree a facet of Edwardian British society, Mangan being the nouveau riche capitalist, Hesione the flighty Bohemian, Ellie a struggling member of the bourgeoisie and so on. Shaw divides the Edwardian upper-class into two facets: the traditional country-based gentry and aristocracy (those of Horseback Hall) and the upper middle-class (those of Heartbreak House). The \\"horsey set\\" are identified with activity, most of it pointless; the rentiers with passivity, equally pointless. Both groups share the delusion that their worlds could continue to travel in tandem forever, which they did until Sarajevo. =Character traits= One of Shaw's most important and evident themes is reality versus appearances. By the end of the play, each character is revealed to be nothing like who they appeared to be in the beginning. Mangan, who was reported to be \\"a Napoleon of industry\\" is revealed in the third act to be virtually penniless and incapable of running his own businesses. It is in fact Mazzini who runs Mangan's businesses although he at first appears mild and incompetent. =Fate= Mazzini's belief in fate ruling his life reinforces his feeble ability to control his situation and according to the captain dooms the ship to destruction unless competent navigation can be learned: Captain Shotover: \\"Navigation. Learn it and live; or leave it and be damned.\\" (p. 141) =Play in performance= The play was first performed in New York at the Garrick Theatre in November 1920, with Albert Perry as Shotover and Elizabeth Risdon as Ellie Dunn. It was first presented in England on 18 October 1921, at the Royal Court, with Ellen O'Malley as Ellie and Brember Wills as Shotover. Edith Evans played Lady Utterword.Violet M. Broad & C. Lewis Broad , Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw, A. & C. Black, London, 1929, p.221 Heartbreak House is not often performed due to its complex structure; however it is argued that the genius of the play cannot be fully appreciated without seeing it in performance. Its subject-matter is the ignorance and indifference exhibited by the upper and upper-middle classes to the First World War and its consequences. The self-indulgence and lack of understanding of the high-class characters are central issues in British society at the time that the play illuminates. It was directed by John Schlesinger in a production by the National Theatre at the Old Vic in 1975 with Anna Massey, Colin Blakely, Eileen Atkins, Patience Collier and Kate Nelligan. In 1981 it was produced at the Royal Exchange, Manchester directed by Jonathon Hales with Eleanor Bron and Lynsey Baxter A major Broadway revival was mounted in 1984, with an all star cast headed by Sir Rex Harrison as Shotover (a role for which he was nominated for a Tony), and featuring Amy Irving, Rosemary Harris, Dana Ivey, George N. Martin and Tom Aldredge. The play has been performed several times at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the- Lake, Ontario, Canada: most notably in 1968 directed by Val Gielgud and with Jessica Tandy, Paxton Whitehead, Tony Van Bridge and Frances Hyland (this production was recorded and released by Caedmon Records [Caedmon TRS-335]); then in summer 2011 directed by Christopher Newton with Michael Ball as Captain Shotover, Blair Williams as Hector, Patrick McManus as Mazzini, Laurie Paton as Ariadne, Benedict Campbell as Mangan and Robin Evans Willis as Ellie. It also formed part of Chichester Festival Theatre's 50th Anniversary Season in 2012 and cast Derek Jacobi as Captain Shotover. The Denver Center Theatre Company staged it for a run 30 March to 29 April 2012. It is available on VHS based on the 1985 television version directed by Anthony Page, with Rex Harrison as Shotover, Amy Irving as Ellie and Rosemary Harris as Hesione. Also available on DVD is the 1977 BBC Play of the Month version directed by Cedric Messina, with John Gielgud as Shotover, Lesley-Anne Down as Ellie and Si√¢n Phillips as Hesione. The play was performed at Shaw's Corner 25‚Äì27 July 2014, produced by Michael Friend and by the Abbey Theatre, Dublin from 14 August to 13 September 2014. In 2018, the play was staged Off-Broadway from 28 August to 29 September.https://www.broadwayworld.com/off-broadway/article/Photo- Coverage-Meet-the-Company-of-Gingold-Theatrical-Groups-HEARTBREAK- HOUSE-20180731 The production was directed by David Staller and produced by Gingold Theatrical Group, a New York-Based Theatre Group dedicated to presenting plays that echo Shaw's values.https://gingoldgroup.org/season/heartbreak-house Aleksandr Sokurov's loose film adaptation Mournful Unconcern (Skorbnoye beschuvstviye) was made in 1987.

Orchids in this genus are epiphytes, lithophytes or terrestrial plants with flat, leathery leaves and short-lived flowers with the sepals and petals more or less similar to each other. The labellum is rigidly fixed to the column and has three lobes. The side lobes are erect and the middle lobe is thick and fleshy. There are about 190 species distributed from tropical and subtropical Asia to the Western Pacific. Most species grow in lowland or tropical rainforests up to an altitude of 1,200 m. Description Orchids in the genus Thrixspermum are epiphytic or lithophytic, rarely terrestrial, monopodial herbs with long thick roots, and flat, fleshy leaves arranged in two ranks with their bases sheathing the stem. The flowers are arranged on a pendulous or arching flowering stem arising from a leaf axil. The flowers are usually short-lived and often open for less than a day. The sepals are free from and more or less similar to each other. The petals are free from each other and similar to, but slightly shorter than the sepals. The labellum is stiffly attached to the column with a pouched base and three lobes, the side lobes erect, usually short and blunt and the middle lobe thick and fleshy. The fruit is a long, thin capsule. Taxonomy and naming The genus Thrixspermum was first formally described in 1790 by Jo√£o de Loureiro in Flora Cochinchinensis. The name Thrixspermum is derived from the Ancient Greek words (), meaning \\"hair\\" and () meaning \\"seed\\".Backer, C.A. (1936).

She was the second Estonian musician with higher education. Her greatest contribution is perhaps the fact that she took organ music to the countryside, as virtually no skilled organists gave concerts outside of towns. During her 60-year creative career, she wrote more than 200 choral songs, 10 cavatinas, a canto, \\"Kalev and Linda\\" and much more. She composed mainly vocal music.  Biography  H√§rma was born Miina Hermann in 1864 in K√µrvek√ºla, Livonia, Russian Empire to a local teacher and his wife. There were seven children in the family. Both of her parents were musically educated. H√§rma began to learn music on her own with a small organ her father bought her. When she was 15, H√§rma began studying with K. A. Hermann, who gave her lessons in both musical composition and piano. In 1883, H√§rma entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory as its only organ student that year. She graduated in 1890, but continued to live in Saint Petersburg because it was very hard to find work in the Baltic governorates. In 1894, the fifth Estonian Song Festival took place, which led to the formation of H√§rma's own choir. Miina H√§rma conducting at the IX Estonian Song Festival in Tallinn in 1928 In 1903, as financial problems overwhelmed her, H√§rma moved to Kronstadt, Governorate of Saint Petersburg. She had to leave the city in 1915 because of the beginning of the First World War, as no civilians were allowed to stay there. Despite the fact that music had rapidly developed in Tartu, it was still hard to find a job as a music teacher, since there were almost no students due to the war. In 1917, H√§rma became a music teacher in a school that is now the Miina H√§rma Gymnasium. H√§rma died on November 16, 1941, in Tartu. She is buried in the Raadi Cemetery.

Life Jessie Rooke was born in London on September 10, 1845, to William Walker and Catherine Scollay. Rooke moved to Melbourne, and in 1867, she married New Zealander Peter Charles Reid. After he died, she married widower Charles Rooke on August 14, 1883. The Rookes moved to Tasmania in the early 1890s, and Jessie Rooke became involved with the Burnie Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). She was elected president in 1894. The WCTU emerged as leaders of the Tasmanian suffrage campaign. In 1896 Rooke toured Tasmania with suffrage superintendent Georgina Kermode. They arranged public meetings of women, collecting campaign funds, distributing pamphlets, and collecting signatures on a petition calling for the vote to be extended to women. The petition was presented to the Tasmanian parliament at the end of 1896. In 1898 Rooke toured Tasmania again with South Australian Elizabeth Nicholls. They visited 30 towns collecting signatures on a petition. Although suffrage bills were defeated in both 1896 and 1897, the Electoral Act of 1903 granted Tasmanian women the right to vote. In 1898, Rooke became president of the Tasmanian WCTU branch, and in 1903, president of the Australian WCTU. Rooke was a delegate to the 1902 International Council of Women Conference in Washington, and, in 1903, she founded the Tasmanian Women's Suffrage Association, which mobilized women for the next election.

It is located about 3 km south of the town of Wolfville on the Gaspereau River. The name \\"Gaspereau\\" is often used to refer to all of the communities along the 15 km Gaspereau Valley which include Gaspereau, Wallbrook, Melanson, Benjamin Bridge and White Rock. The name is derived from the Gaspereau fish, Alosa pseudoharengus, which migrates up the river every spring. The fishing of Gaspereau has been important to human settlement of the Gaspereau Valley for thousands of years. When the Acadians came here around 1680, they named the fish and the area \\"Gasparot\\". There is still a commercial fishery for Gaspereau in the river. The term \\"Rivi√®re des Gasparots\\" is mentioned in a 1701 census of Acadia. Gaspereau Vineyards, NS Plate showing Gaspereau Valley Scene Gaspereau is primarily an agricultural community, hosting dairy farms and apple orchards. In recent years many grape vineyards have been established and there is more than one winery in the village. Gaspereau Vineyards, opened in 2004, and L'Acadie Vineyards, opened in 2008, are both popular destinations in the village of Gaspereau. The Gaspereau River is also known for tubing. During the hot summer months residents and visitors float on inner-tubes down through lush, tranquil river scenery when the river is high. Visitors can often rent tubes from nearby houses, but they should also be aware that the river is part of nature, not a theme-park: depending on the activity of the hydro dam that controls water levels and flow in the river there can be areas of powerful flow, overhanging obstacles or protruding rocks. Non-swimmers should wear life jackets and be in the company of competent swimmers. Gaspereau is also home to a canal (referred to as \\"The Canal\\" or \\"The Gaspereau Canal\\" or \\"White Rock Canal\\"). The 1.5 km long canal brings water from the White Rock reservoir to the hydroelectricity generating station.

Its site is in the eastern outskirts of modern-day Alexandria, around from the center of that city. Canopus was located on the western bank at the mouth of the westernmost branch of the Delta ‚Äì known as the Canopic or Heracleotic branch. It belonged to the seventh Egyptian Nome, known as Menelaites, and later as Canopites, after it. It was the principal port in Egypt for Greek trade before the foundation of Alexandria, along with Naucratis and Heracleion. Its ruins lie near the present Egyptian town of Abu Qir. Name The settlement's Egyptian name was written in Demotic as pr-gw·π± (sometimes romanized Peguat or Pikuat). The Greeks called it Canopus (, K√°n≈çpos) after a legendary commander of the era of the Trojan War supposedly buried there. The English form of the name derives from the Latinized form used under Roman rule. History =Ancient Egypt= Canopus was the site of a temple to the Egyptian god Serapis. The name of Canopus appears in the first half of the 6th century BC in a poem by Solon.PDF file Research by Franck Goddio Early Egyptological excavations some 2 or 3 km from the area known today as Abu Qir have revealed extensive traces of the city with its quays, and granite monuments with the name of Ramesses II, but they may have been brought in for the adornment of the place at a later date. The exact date of the foundation of Canopus is unknown, but Herodotus refers to it as an ancient port. Homeric myth claims that it was founded by Menelaus, and named after Canopus, the pilot of his ship, who died there after being bitten by a serpent. Legend describes how Menelaus built a monument to his memory on the shore, around which the town later grew up. There is unlikely to be any connection with \\"canopy\\". A temple to Osiris was built by king Ptolemy III Euergetes, but according to Herodotus, very near to Canopus was an older shrine, a temple of Heracles that served as an asylum for fugitive slaves. Osiris was worshipped at Canopus under a peculiar form: that of a vase with a human head. Through an old misunderstanding, the name \\"canopic jars\\" was applied by early Egyptologists to the vases with human and animal heads in which the internal organs were placed by the Egyptians after embalming. =Hellenistic Era= In Ptolemy III Euergetes' ninth regnal year (239 BC), a great assembly of priests at Canopus passed an honorific decree (the \\"Decree of Canopus\\") that, inter alia, conferred various new titles on the king and his consort, Berenice. Three examples of this decree are now known (plus some fragments), inscribed in Egyptian (in both hieroglyphic and demotic) and in classical Greek, and they were second only to the more famous Rosetta Stone in providing the key to deciphering the ancient Egyptian language. This was the earliest of the series of bilingual inscriptions of the \\"Rosetta Stone Series\\", also known as the Ptolemaic Decrees. There are three such Decrees altogether. The town had a large trade in henna. =Roman Era= In Roman times, the town was notorious for its dissoluteness. Juvenal's Satire VI referred to the \\"debauchery\\" that prevailed there. The emperor Hadrian built a villa at Tivoli, 18 miles away from Rome, where he replicated for his enjoyment architectural patterns from all parts of the Roman Empire. One of these (and the most excavated and studied today) was borrowed from Canopus. =Modern town= The Egyptian town of Abu Qir (\\"Father Cyrus\\"), honoring two Christian martyrs, is located a few kilometres away from the ruins of Canopus. It is a town (around 1900 with 1000 inhabitants), at the end of a little peninsula north-east of Alexandria. It has a trade in quails, which are caught in nets hung along the shore. Off Aboukir on 1 August 1798, the French Mediterranean fleet was destroyed within the roads by British Admiral Horatio Nelson. On 25 July 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte destroyed there a Turkish army 18,000 strong; and on 8 March 1801, the French garrison of 1,800 men was defeated by 20,000 English and Ottoman Turks commanded by Abercromby. See of Canopus Egypt had many martyrs in the persecution of Diocletian, among others St. Athanasia with her three daughters, and St. Cyrus and John. There was here a monastery called Metanoia, founded by monks from Tabennisi, where many a patriarch of Alexandria took shelter during the religious quarrels of the 5th century. east of Canopus was the famous Pharaonic temple of Manouthin, afterwards destroyed by monks, and a church on the same spot dedicated to the Four Evangelists. St. Cyril of Alexandria solemnly transported the relics of the holy martyrs Cyrus and John into the church, which became an important place of pilgrimage. It was here that St. Sophronius of Jerusalem was healed of an ophthalmy that had been declared incurable by the physicians (610‚Äì619), whereupon he wrote the panegyric of the two saints with a compilation of seventy miracles worked in their sanctuary (Migne, Patrologia Graeca, LXXXVII, 3379-676) Canopus formed, with Menelaus and Schedia, a suffragan see subject to Alexandria in the Roman province of Aegyptus Prima; it is usually called Schedia in the Notitiae episcopatuum. Two titulars are mentioned by Lequien (II, 415), one in 325, the other in 362. Archaeology Ptolemaic coins from the submerged Heracleion Over time the land around Canopus was weakened by a combination of earthquakes, tsunamis and rising sea levels. Finds of pottery and coins appear to stop at the end of the 2nd century BC. At this point, probably after a severe flood, the eastern suburbs succumbed to liquefaction of the soil on which it was built. The hard clay turned rapidly into a liquid and the buildings collapsed. The western suburbs eventually became the present day Egyptian coastal city of Abu Qir. In 1933 ruins were sighted under the water by an RAF commander who was flying over Abu Qir Bay. Egyptian scholar Prince Omar Toussoun subsequently undertook archaeological investigations between 1934 and 1940. The undersea ruins were eventually identified as the lost cities of Heracleion and Canopus. In 2000 the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio explored the submerged ruins of the two cities. Archaeological discoveries made by Goddio's team included parts of the \\"Naos of the Decades\\" temple and pieces of various statues, including a marble head of the god Serapis.

As a boy, Uppdal worked as a shepherd, and later as a miner and construction worker. In 1907 he started working for Norsk Hydro, and came to their factory in Rjukan in 1910-1911. In 1905, he debuted with Ung sorg (Young sorrow) and Kv√¶de (Songs), collections of poetry, followed by Sollaug in 1908, and Villfuglar (Wild birds) in 1909. With the short-stories collection Ved Akerselva (By the Aker River) in 1910, Uppdal introduced his epic 10-volume series of novels, Dansen gjenom skuggeheimen (The Dance through the Shadow Land). Here listed are the separate volumes in the order that Uppdal himself later designated and explained in the preface to Herdsla, along with year of publication: * (1919) Stigeren (The Foreman of the Miners) * (1912/1922) Trolldom i lufta (Witchcraft in the Air) * (1923) Vandringa (The Wander) [a revision of Ved Akerselva] * (1920) Kongen (The King) * (1911/1921) Dansen gjenom skuggeheimen (The Dance through the Shadow Land) * (1921) Domkyrkjebyggaren (The Cathedral Builder) * (1922) I skiftet (In the change) * (1914/1923) R√∏ysingfolket (The R√∏ysing People) * (1924) Fjelskjeringa (The Mountain Trench) * (1924) Herdsla (The Toughening) Uppdal seems to have decided to link the stories together in hindsight, as he outlined the plan in the last volume, Herdsla, and thus revised and republish the three volumes first published so they'd fit the puzzle. His intent, by his own statements, was to describe the dawn of the working class, its severance from its origins (the peasantry), the proletarization, and finally the modern worker and the worker movement. At the same time, Uppdal claimed he was not a \\"proletarian poet;\\" his main purpose was to describe the human being. Two of the volumes were republished in revised editions in the 1950s, in which Uppdal (in addition to expanding the narrative considerably, and emphasizing the political agenda) had changed the language used into a more archaic and dialectal form. These editions didn't win any acclaim, and later editions of the series in the 1970s and 1985-91 were made from the 1919-24 editions. Uppdal was also an important lyric poet. He gathered his finest poetry of youth and adulthood in Elskhug (Love) in 1919, and Altarelden (The Altar Fire) in 1920. Of his poetry, Johs. A. Dale has written that \\"It has a primitive strength and a masculine self-assertion, and is marked by suffering and conflict of the soul.\\" Uppdal was finally granted a poet's pension by the state in 1939, perhaps due to his long periods of financial hardship. When confronted with his difficult prose and asked if he had plans to make his novels more audience-friendly, he is said to have responded: \\"I don't give a damn about the audience! Don't give a hoot about what anyone else says, be yourself even if it should take you straight to the pits of Hell.\\" References * Store Norske Leksikon Category:1878 births Category:1961 deaths Category:20th-century Norwegian poets Category:Norwegian male poets Category:20th-century Norwegian novelists Category:Norwegian male novelists Category:20th-century Norwegian male writers Category:People from Steinkjer ","title":"Kristofer Uppdal"},{"id":"1963331","text":"Borinda is a genus of clumping bamboos erected in 1994 by Christopher Mark Adrian Stapleton and previously included in the genera Fargesia and Yushania.

Some remains of the castle, which stood for only 50 years, are still visible on what is now Vredenburg square in Utrecht.  History  In 1528, the Holy Roman Empire annexed the Bishopric of Utrecht, and Emperor Charles V immediately ordered the construction of a castle in Utrecht, not only to protect the domain from invasion by the duke of Guelders, but also to retain control over the city's unruly population. Construction began in 1529 and was completed in 1532. On 8 November 1576, the States General of the Seventeen Provinces ratified an agreement, known as the Pacification of Ghent, to remove Spanish occupying soldiers. In response the castle's Spanish garrison prepared to be besieged by the Dutch rebels, turning the castle's cannons towards the city itself. By December, the siege was underway and fighting broke out between the Spanish and Dutch. However, the garrison abandoned the castle on 11 February 1577, following negotiations between garrison commander Francesco Fernando d'Avila and Maximilien de H√©nin-Li√©tard, the count of Bossu, who served as temporary Dutch stadholder. The abandonment was part of a general withdrawal agreed upon by the new Governor-General Don Juan one day later, on 12 February. The citizens of Utrecht demanded that the castle be demolished to prevent the Spanish or other foreign powers from dominating the city again in future. However, the city government opposed demolition, so as not to offend the emperor. On 2 May, the population took the matter into their own hands. According to legend, a group of local women led by Trijn van Leemput stormed the castle and Trijn gave the signal for the castle to be destroyed by removing the first bricks from the castle walls. Despite doubts about the historical accuracy of this tale, a statue of Trijn van Leemput was erected on the in Utrecht in 1955. The demolition of the castle lasted until 1581. The two western towers remained standing, as they were part of the outer city walls. However, they were also demolished piece by piece in the following centuries; by 1919 they had completely disappeared. The foundations of Vredenburg castle were uncovered during archaeological excavations in 1976 and 1978.

On 29 July 1940, manufacturers Albright & Wilson of Oldbury demonstrated to the Royal Air Force how their white phosphorus could be used to ignite incendiary bombs. The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition, but the idea of a self-igniting petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an \\"A.W. bomb\\", it was officially named the \\"No. 76 grenade\\", but was more commonly known as the \\"SIP\\" (self-igniting phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was white phosphorus, benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper.War Office. Military Training Manual No 42, Appendix B: The Self-Igniting Phosphorus Grenade, The AW Grenade. 29 August 1940, p. 25. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve making the contents slightly sticky and the mixture would separate into two layers ‚Äì this was intentional and the grenade was not to be shaken to mix the layers as this would only delay ignition.Handbook for the Projectors, 2¬Ω inch, Marks I & II September 1941. p. 26. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite, liberating choking fumes of phosphorus pentoxide and sulphur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat. Strict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely, preferably underwater and certainly never in a house. Mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon, it was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured.Northover Projectors - WO 185/23, The National Archives The grenade could either be thrown by hand, or fired from the Northover projector, a simple mortar; a stronger container was needed for the latter and the two types were colour-coded. There were many who were sceptical about the efficacy of Molotov cocktails and SIP grenades against the more modern German tanks. Weapon designer Stuart Macrae witnessed a trial of the SIP grenade at Farnborough: \\"There was some concern that, if the tank drivers could not pull up quickly enough and hop out, they were likely to be frizzled to death, but after looking at the bottles they said they would be happy to take a chance.\\" The drivers were proved right; trials on modern British tanks confirmed that Molotov and SIP grenades caused the occupants of the tanks \\"no inconvenience whatsoever\\". The Home Guard hid caches of these grenades during the war for use in the event of an invasion. Not all locations were officially recorded and some caches were lost. Occasionally, the caches are discovered by builders digging foundations. In all cases, the grenades are still found to be dangerous and typically are destroyed via a controlled explosion.

While most of Fulci's films have been released uncut in the United Kingdom, The New York Ripper remains censored to this day, even for its 2011 DVD and Blu-ray releases.  Plot  An old man is walking his dog in New York City when the dog retrieves a decomposed human hand. It is identified by the police as belonging to Ann-Lynne, a local model. Lieutenant Fred Williams (Jack Hedley), the burned-out police detective investigating the murder, interviews the young woman's nosy landlady, Mrs. Weissburger (Babette New), who tells him that during her daily spying and eavesdropping on her tenants, she overheard the girl last week over the phone arranging to meet a man who spoke with a strange, duck-like voice. Meanwhile, a young woman (Cinzia de Ponti) rides her bicycle down Manhattan to the Staten Island Ferry at Battery Park. After an altercation with a motorist, she rides onto the boat. When the ferry is underway, the young woman sneaks into the car-bay and begins vandalizing the man's car, but is interrupted by an unseen figure, who adopts a grotesque duck voice and brutally murders her with a switchblade. At the morgue, Williams talks to Barry Jones the pathologist (Giordano Falzoni), who believes he recognizes the \\"style\\" of the killing and links it to Ann-Lynne, as well as a similar case in Harlem the previous month. Having informed the press that a serial killer is at large, Williams is visited at the station by New York's chief of police (Lucio Fulci), who tells him not to make any further public announcements about the case to avoid starting a citywide panic. Soon after the chief leaves, Williams is notified that a man \\"sounding like a duck\\" phoned while he was out at the press conference wanting to speak with him. Williams travels to Columbia University, where he meets with a brilliant young psychotherapy professor named Dr. Paul Davis (Paolo Malco) for help in creating a profile of the killer. That night in New York's red-light district, Jane Lodge (Alexandra Delli Colli), attends a live sex show and records the simulated moans and groans of the two performers with a pocket tape recorder. A scruffy, dangerous-looking man (Howard Ross), with two fingers missing from his right hand sits nearby and observes what she is doing. After the show has ended, the female performer (Zora Kerova) retires backstage to her dressing room only to find it totally dark. Hearing a noise, she opens a closet door and is brutally attacked and killed by the maniac. Later that night, at the home of Kitty (Daniela Doria), a prostitute regularly visited by Williams, he receives a taunting phone call from the duck-voiced killer saying that he has killed again. The next day, Jane shows her latest tape recording to her husband, Dr. Lodge (Laurence Welles), who has agreed to support their open- marriage. Jane goes to a bar in a rough neighborhood where she's approached by two Hispanic bar punks (Antone Pag√°n) and (Josh Cruze) who proceed to fondle and sexually humiliate her. The emotionally troubled Jane runs out and drives away. That night, Fay Majors (Almanta Keller), a young woman, is riding alone on a late-night subway train when she gets menaced by the man from the live sex theater. She runs off the train, through the deserted subway station, and onto the street where she gets attacked in a dark alley by the quacking maniac, who stabs her in the leg and slashes her hands and arms as she tries to defend herself. Limping away, Fay stumbles through a doorway into an apartment building. She locks the door behind her, then passes out from the loss of blood. Reality and illusion blur: Fay is sitting alone in a dark movie theater watching cartoons when she attacked and killed by a handsome young man who slashes her neck with a straight razor. Fay wakes up in the hospital the morning after when the same man visits her in her room. He is revealed to be her physicist boyfriend, Peter Bunch (Andrew Painter). Later Williams and Dr. Davis visit Fay, and she tells them her attacker was missing two fingers from his right hand. Williams and Davis both conclude that this is the killer since all forensic evidence points to the killer being left-handed. Somewhere in night-time New York, the owner of the mutilated right hand picks up Jane and takes her to a sleazy hotel room for bondage sex. The S&M; game she had willingly begun soon turns nasty, and he begins to beat her. Then the man turns up the radio while it plays Berto Pisano's \\"Tic nervoso\\" and makes a muttered phone-call, describing the bound woman to the person on the other end of the line as someone who's \\"right up your perverted alley.\\" A little later, while the man sleeps, Jane overhears a radio DJ describing the killer, whom the press has now dubbed, 'the New York Ripper,' as missing two fingers from his right hand. Jane quietly unties herself and flees into the hotel hallway only to encounter the real ripper just as she makes for the exit. Wielding a switchblade, he kills her by stabbing her several times in the throat and then slicing open her abdomen from the groin to the breasts. Williams arrives at the scene when the police find Jane's tape recordings of the sex shows and of her 'master.' Learning from witnesses, Williams discovers that the identity of the 8-fingered man is Mickey Scellenda - a Greek immigrant with a history of sexual assault and drug abuse. Williams and the police step up the search for Scellenda after raiding his apartment, finding photographs of most of the Ripper victims and huge stashes of pornography and drug paraphernalia. Williams also pays a visit to Dr. Lodge to inform him of his wife's murder. Dr. Lodge tearfully defends his open marriage, which gets him a sneering response from the moralistic Williams. Meanwhile, Dr. Davis begins to express doubt to the killer's identity, as Scellenda is only a petty criminal, not matching the high intelligence that Davis had established in profiling the Ripper. Davis then buys a gay porn magazine at a local newsstand (revealing his repressed homosexuality) and pays a visit to Peter and Fay at their house to ask them more questions about Fay's experience. Something about their story arouses his suspicion. That evening, after Peter goes out, Fay is attacked in their house by Scellenda, who breaks in trying to kill her. She is saved when Peter returns, and the man flees. A few days later, Williams gets another taunting phone call from the New York Ripper, who wants to \\"dedicate a murder\\" to him. Williams and the police put a trace on the line and race to the location, only to find that the killer has set up a two-way radio to a remote phone booth, while he is presently in the home of Kitty, the young prostitute favored by Williams, torturing her. Williams races to Kitty's apartment, but is too late as the killer has fled, leaving behind Kitty's maimed corpse to be discovered. Sometime later, the dead body of Mickey Scellenda is found having committed suicide. When Dr. Barry Jones informs Williams that Scellenda was dead for the last eight days, four days before Kitty's murder, Williams realizes that they have been tailing the wrong man. He relays this to Professor Davis, who is both delighted and disappointed with the news. Davis explains that with Scellenda eliminated as a suspect, his original idea to the killer's identity is confirmed; a misogynist psychopath who used Scellenda to throw the police off his trail. Fay is shown visiting a hospital where Peter has a child from a previous marriage, a little girl named Susy, who is dying from a rare bone disorder. Visiting the hospital, Williams and Davis observe Susy in her hospital bed and decide to race over to Peter and Fay's place to arrest both of them. At the house, one of them gets a phone call from a duck- voiced person, while the other one overhears. While Peter goes into the kitchen for dinner, Fay has disappeared. Going upstairs to Susy's bedroom, Fay jumps out of the darkness at Peter while stabbing him with a kitchen knife. Peter rises, quacking like a duck, and struggles with Fay in which they both tumble down the stairs. Just as Peter grabs the knife away from Fay and is about to stab her, Williams runs in and literally blasts Peter's face off with his gun. In the ambulance, Davis explains to Fay her deranged boyfriend's motivation for killing. His hatred of sexually active women stemmed from bitterness at the cruel blow fate had dealt his young daughter, who will never enjoy the freedoms of his victims. After leaving the scene, the phone in the now-deserted house rings again. In her hospital bed, Susy is calling out for her father, pleading to him to answer her call, as her voice is drowned out beneath the indifferent traffic of the city.  Cast  *Jack Hedley as Lt.

The lead heroine role had originally been offered to British actress Catriona MacColl who had starred in Fulci's, City of the Living Dead (1980), The Beyond (1981) and House by the Cemetery (1981), but she turned it down and the role went to Almanta Suska. Zora Kerova, who played Eva in the film, spoke positively about working with Fulci and stated that it took a while for Fulci to warm up to her. When asked what she thought of the film, she stated she \\"didn't like The New York Ripper at all.\\" Release The New York Ripper was released on 4 March 1982 in Italy. In the United Kingdom, the film was screened for the BBFC, with Carol Tpolski describing the film as \\"simply the most damaging film I have ever seen in my whole life\\" and \\"a relentless catalogue of the eponymous antihero/villain cutting women up.\\" The film was banned in the United Kingdom, where it could not be sold or owned until 2002. The film received a limited theatrical release in the United States in 1984 and was released on VHS in 1987, where it was slightly edited by Vidmark Entertainment.  Critical reception  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on , with a weighted average rating of 3/10. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called the film \\"sour and pointless,\\" adding that it \\"utilizes all the necessary ingredients but fails to summon from them the magisterial dignity one expects from the finer NYC vomitoriums.\\" On his website, Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar criticized the film's clich√©d plot, obvious identity of the killer and attempts at pathos, the latter of which he felt were \\"forced and ineffectual.\\" In the end, Sindelar stated that the film's nastiness and gore were its primary appeal, while also noting that it \\"will certainly not be to everyone‚Äôs taste.\\" Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide gave the film 1/4 stars, writing, \\"Fulci alternates sleazy sex scenes with graphic and deeply misogynistic murders, fills the plots with twists that make no sense, then wraps the whole thing up in a preposterous psychological flourish.\\" Robert Firsching of AllMovie claimed that the film was Fulci \\"pandering to the lowest common denominator as never before in his career\\". He added that \\"Fulci showed with this blatant play for the sicko slasher crowd that the days of well-plotted, stylish Italian horror were gone, replaced with the most vicious sort of sexual violence and perversion\\", concluding that the film was a \\"shameful piece of work\\".

Boston College presidency =Achievements= Since becoming Boston College president, Leahy has accelerated the growth and development of the university initiated by his predecessor J. Donald Monan. Boston College's endowment has continued to increase rapidly to more than $2 billion, making BC one of the 50 wealthiest universities in the nation. During the years after the global recession of 2008, Leahy's effective fiscal governance has enabled BC to emerge in a position of strength. BC had the fastest-growing endowment of many high-ranking universities. During Leahy's presidency, the campus has expanded by almost 150 acres (607,000 m¬≤), and undergraduate applications have surpassed 30,000. At the same time, its students, faculty and athletic teams have seen unprecedented success ‚Äî winning record numbers of Truman, Marshall, Fulbright, Rhodes scholarships as well as other academic awards and research grants. In 2006, after a two-year self- study involving more than 200 BC faculty, administrators, students and alumni, Leahy announced a $1.6-billion strategic plan that called for hiring 100 new faculty, adding a dozen new academic centers and spending $1 billion in construction and renovation projects to elevate Boston College to the highest echelon of premier national universities. The Plan set seven strategic directions for the University: To become a national leader in liberal arts education and student formation; to enhance its research initiatives in select natural sciences and in areas that address urgent social problems; to support leadership initiatives in BC's graduate and professional schools; to expand international programs and partnerships. Leahy's stated goal was to establish Boston College as \\"the world's leading Catholic university.\\" In line with this direction, the Weston Jesuit School of Theology re-affiliated with Boston College in 2008 to form the new School of Theology and Ministry. During the same year, Leahy started the construction of Stokes Hall, a administrative and classroom building for BC's humanities departments, which opened in 2012. Already in 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program to examine issues facing the Roman Catholic Church in light of the clergy sexual abuse scandal. In athletics, Boston College won conference and national titles during Leahy's presidency: for example four national men's ice hockey championships.

Five playing cards are dealt to the player, while the dealer is dealt five cards face down and a sixth card face up. Both the player and the dealer make their best four-card hands. The dealer's advantages are in having an extra card and the fact that if the player folds, he will lose his ante, even if his hand turns out to be better than the dealer's. After seeing their cards and the dealer's face up card, the player can opt to fold the ante bet, in which case the player loses it, or play by betting 1-3 times their ante. Unlike Three Card Poker and some other games, the dealer always qualifies (plays). If the player ties or beats the dealer, the player is paid the amount bet. A bonus is paid if the player has a three of a kind (2-1 for the original ante bet only), straight flush (20-1), or four of a kind (25-1). This bonus is paid out even if the dealer's hand is better than the player's; however, in this situation, the player would still lose their ante and play bets. The Aces Up bet depends solely on the player's hand. If the player has a pair of aces or better, they win, otherwise they lose. The dealer's hand is immaterial.

Their demo releases The Bemoaning of Metatron and Metatron and the Red Gleaming Serpent gained them a good deal of critical attention in the underground metal press, even receiving mentions from such mainstream sources as Kerrang! magazine, and they soon signed to Supernal Music after the release of their widely acclaimed final demo The Watchers of Catal Huyuk. Their albums, particularly 2001's The Excommunication of Christ explore conceptual themes based around an anti- Christian interpretation of the Bible and Apocrypha. Despite a fluctuating line-up, the band continues to release well-received music. One of the band's most consistent features is their use of guest musicians.

Early career Clapperton was born in Annan, Dumfriesshire, where his father, George Clapperton, was a surgeon. He gained some knowledge of practical mathematics and navigation, and at thirteen was apprenticed on board a vessel which traded between Liverpool and North America. After having made several voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, he was impressed for the navy, in which he soon rose to the rank of midshipman. During the Napoleonic Wars he saw a good deal of active service, and at the storming of Port Louis, Mauritius, in November 1810, he was first in the breach and hauled down the French flag. In 1814 Clapperton went to Canada, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and to the command of a schooner on the Canadian lakes. In 1817, when the flotilla on the lakes was dismantled, he returned home on half-pay. In 1820 Clapperton removed to Edinburgh, where he made the acquaintance of Walter Oudney, who aroused his interest in African travel. African exploration Lieutenant G. F. Lyon having returned from an unsuccessful attempt to reach Bornu from Tripoli, the British government determined on a second expedition to that country. Walter Oudney was appointed by Lord Bathurst, then colonial secretary, to proceed to Bornu as consul, accompanied by Hugh Clapperton. From Tripoli, early in 1822, they set out southward to Murzuk, where they were later joined by Major Dixon Denham, who found both men in a wretched condition. They eventually proceeded south from Murzuk on 29 November 1822. By this time, a deep antipathy had developed between Clapperton and Denham, Denham secretly sending home malicious reports about Clapperton having homosexual relations with one of the Arab servants. The accusation, based on a rumour spread by a disgruntled servant dismissed by Clapperton for theft, was almost certainly unfounded, and Denham later withdrew it but without telling Clapperton he had done so, leading the historian Bovill to observe that 'it remains difficult to recall in all the checkered (sic) history of geographic discovery.... a more odious man than Dixon Denham'.Bovill, E. W. (ed.) (1966). Missions to the Niger. Vols. II ‚Äì IV. The Bornu Mission, 1822‚Äì25. Cambridge University Press. Denham and Clapperton received by Sheikh al-Kaneimi at Kuka On 17 February 1823, the party eventually reached Kuka (now Kukawa in Nigeria), capital of the Bornu Empire, where they were well received by the sultan Sheikh al-Kaneimi, having earlier become the first white men to see Lake Chad. Whilst at Kuka, Clapperton and Oudney parted company with Denham on 14 December to explore the course of the Niger River. Denham remained behind to explore and survey the western, south and south-eastern shores of Lake Chad, and the lower courses of the rivers Waube, Logone and Shari. However, only a few weeks later, Oudney died at the village of Murmur, located near the town of Katagum on the road to Kano. Undeterred, Clapperton continued his journey alone through Kano to Sokoto, the capital of the Fulani Empire, where by order of Sultan Muhammed Bello he was obliged to stop, though the Niger was only a five-day journey to the west. Exhausted by his travels, he returned by way of Zaria and Katsina to Kuka, where Denham found him barely recognizable after his privations. Clapperton and Denham departed Kuka for Tripoli in August 1824, reaching Tripoli on 26 January 1825. Their mutual antipathy unabated, they exchanged not a word during the 133-day journey. The pair continued their journey to England, arriving home to a heroes' welcome on 1 June 1825. An account of their travels was published in 1826 under the title Narrative of Travels and Discoveries in Northern and Central Africa in the years 1822‚Äì1823 and 1824. Immediately after his return to England, Clapperton was raised to the rank of commander, and sent out with another expedition to Africa, the sultan Bello of Sokoto having professed his eagerness to open up trade with the west coast. Clapperton came out on HMS Brazen, which was joining the West Africa Squadron for the suppression of the slave trade. He landed at Badagry in the Bight of Benin, and started overland for the Niger on 7 December 1825, having with him his servant Richard Lemon Lander, Captain Pearce, and Dr. Morrison, navy surgeon and naturalist. Before the month was out Pearce and Morrison were dead of fever. Clapperton continued his journey, and, passing through the Yoruba country, in January 1826 he crossed the Niger at Bussa, the spot where Mungo Park had died twenty years before. Death In July, Clapperton arrived at Kano and thence the Fulani capital Sokoto, intending to continue to Bornu and renew his acquaintance with the Kanuri leader Sheikh al-Kaneimi. However, the Fulani were now at war with al-Kaneimi, and Sultan Bello refused him permission to leave. After many months' detention, afflicted by malaria, depression, and dysentery, Clapperton died, leaving his servant Lander the only survivor of the expedition. Lander returned to the coast, and at Fernando Po by extraordinary coincidence met Clapperton's old antagonist, Dixon Denham, who duly relayed the news of Clapperton's demise to London.Kryza, F. T. (2007). The Race for Timbuktu. Harper Collins, New York. . Legacy Clapperton was the first European to make known from personal observation the Hausa states, which he visited soon after the establishment of the Sokoto Caliphate by the Fula. In 1829 the Journal of a Second Expedition into the Interior of Africa, &c.;, by Clapperton appeared posthumously, with a biographical sketch of the explorer by his uncle, Lieutenant-Colonel S. Clapperton, as a preface. Richard Lander, who had brought back the journal of his master, also published Records of Captain Clapperton's Last Expedition to Africa ... with the subsequent Adventures of the Author (2 volumes, London, 1830).

Founded in 1997, HTC began as an original design manufacturer and original equipment manufacturer, designing and manufacturing laptop computers. After initially making smartphones based mostly on Windows Mobile, HTC became a co-founding member of the Open Handset Alliance, a group of handset manufacturers and mobile network operators dedicated to the development of the Android mobile operating system. The HTC Dream (marketed by T-Mobile in many countries as the T-Mobile G1) was the first phone on the market to run Android. Although initially successful as a smartphone vendor, competition from Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics, among others, diluted its market share, which reached just 7.2% by April 2015, and the company has experienced consecutive net losses. In 2016, HTC began to diversify its business beyond smartphones, having partnered with Valve to produce a virtual reality platform known as HTC Vive. After having collaborated with Google on its Pixel smartphone, HTC sold roughly half of its design and research talent, as well as non-exclusive rights to smartphone-related intellectual property, to Google in 2017 for billion. History HTC Kangaroo PK10, the first Palm-size PC, released 1998 Cher Wang (ÁéãÈõ™Á¥Ö) and H. T. Cho (ÂçìÁÅ´Âúü) founded HTC in 1997. Initially a manufacturer of notebook computers, HTC began designing some of the world's first touch and wireless hand-held devices in 1998. HTC started making Windows Mobile PDAs and smartphones starting from 2004 under the Qtek brand. In 2006 the range was rebranded as HTC with the launch of the HTC TyTN. In 2007, HTC acquired the mobile device company Dopod International. In 2008, HTC unveiled the HTC Max 4G, the first GSM mobile phone to support WiMAX networks. HTC joined Google's Open Handset Alliance and then developed and released the first device powered by Android in 2008, the HTC Dream. In November 2009 HTC released the HTC HD2, the first Windows Mobile device with a capacitive touchscreen. The same year, HTC Sense debuted as a user interface which continues to be used as of 2018. In July 2010, HTC announced it would begin selling HTC-branded smartphones in China in a partnership with China Mobile. In October 2010, HTC launched the brand tagline \\"quietly brilliant\\"', and the YOU campaign, HTC's first global advertising campaign. The same month, the HTC HD7 was released as one of the launch models of Microsoft's revitalised Windows Phone. In 2010, HTC sold over 24.6 million handsets, up 111% over 2009. At the Mobile World Congress in February 2011, the GSM Association named HTC the \\"Device Manufacturer of the Year\\" in its Global Mobile Awards. In April 2011, HTC surpassed Nokia as the third-largest smartphone manufacturer by market share, behind Apple and Samsung. On 6 July 2011, it was announced that HTC would buy VIA Technologies' stake in S3 Graphics. On 6 August 2011, HTC acquired Dashwire for $18.5M. In August 2011, HTC confirmed a plan for a strategic partnership with Beats Electronics involving acquiring 51 percent of the company. The 2011 Best Global Brands rankings released by Interbrand, listed HTC at #98 and valued it at $3.6 billion. Based on researcher Canalys, in Q3 2011 HTC Corporation became the largest smartphone vendor in the U.S. with 24 percent market share, ahead of Samsung's 21 percent, Apple's 20 percent and BlackBerry's 9 percent. HTC Corporation made different models for each operator. During early 2012, HTC lost much of this U.S. market share due to increased competition from Apple and Samsung. According to analyst firm comScore, HTC only accounted for 9.3% of the United States smartphone market as of February 2013. In light of the company's decrease in prominence, Chief Executive Peter Chou had informed executives that he would step down if the company's newest flagship phone, the 2013 HTC One, had failed to generate impressive sales results. HTC's first quarter results for 2013 showed its year-over-year profit drop by 98.1%, making it the smallest-ever profit for the company‚Äîthe delay of the launch of the HTC One was cited as one of the factors. In June 2012, HTC moved its headquarters from Taoyuan City (now Taoyuan District) to Xindian District, New Taipei City. On 14 January 2013, HTC launched its smartphones in Burma. The HTC One was released in mid-2013 and, subsequently won various industry awards in the best smartphone and best design categories, but global sales of the HTC One were lower than those for Samsung's Galaxy S4 flagship handset and HTC recorded its first ever quarterly loss in early October 2013: a deficit of just under NT$3 billion (about US$100m, ¬£62m). Marketing problems were identified by HTC as the primary reason for its comparative performance, a factor that had been previously cited by the company. During 2013, Microsoft were in negotiations to purchase HTC. This was only revealed in 2018 by Risto Siilasmaa, chairman of Nokia, in an interview with the Helsingin Sanomat. Microsoft would eventually purchase Nokia's mobile phone business that year. In August 2013, HTC debuted a new \\"Here's To Change\\" global marketing campaign featuring actor Robert Downey, Jr., who signed a two-year contract to be HTC's new \\"Instigator of Change.\\". On 27 September 2013, HTC announced that it would sell back its stake in Beats Electronics Following the release of the HTC One, two variants were released to form a trio for the 2013 HTC One lineup. A smaller variant named the HTC One Mini was released in August 2013, and a larger variant named the HTC One Max was released in October 2013. Similar in design and features to the HTC One, the upgraded aspects of the One Max include a display measuring , a fingerprint sensor and a removable back cover for expandable memory. The product was released into the European and Asian retail environment in October 2013, followed by a US launch in early November 2013. In March 2014, HTC released the HTC One (M8), the next version of the HTC One flagship, at press conferences in London and New York City. In a change from previous launches, the HTC One was made available for purchase on the company website and North American mobile carrier websites on the same day a few hours after the launch. In April 2014, HTC reported sales climbing 12.7 percent to NT$22.1 billion, the company's fastest growth since October 2011. In September 2014, Google selected HTC to make its Nexus 9 tablet. In August 2014 HTC announced a Windows Phone-powered variant of the One (M8), their first using the operating system since 2012. HTC ended its long relationship with Microsoft afterwards due to Nokia's dominance in Windows Phone devices, and started focusing solely on Android. On 1 March 2015, HTC unveiled Vive, a virtual reality head-mounted display in collaboration with Valve. In June and October 2015, HTC reported net losses; the company has faced increased competition from other smartphone makers, including Apple, Samsung, and others, which had resulted in a decline in its smartphone sales, as well a major loss of market share. Its smartphone market share had risen back to 7.2 percent in April 2015 due to its strong sales of recent devices, but HTC's stock price had fallen by 90 percent since 2011. In November 2016, HTC reported that it had sold at least 140,000 Vive units, and that each unit was being sold at a profit. In January 2017, HTC unveiled its new U series smartphone line, the U Play and U Ultra; the company described the U series as a \\"new direction\\" for its phones, emphasizing an integrated virtual assistant developed by the company. In February 2017, HTC reported that in the fourth quarter of 2016, its operating losses had decreased by 13% year-over-year, citing \\"robust sales performance\\" and sequential revenue increases throughout the year. On 21 September 2017, Google announced that it would acquire roughly half of the 4,000 employees who worked in HTC's design and research staff, and non-exclusive licences to smartphone-related intellectual property held by HTC, for US$1.1 billion. The employees included the team involved with Google's Pixel smartphone, which was manufactured by HTC. Google stated that the purchase was part of its efforts to bolster its first-party hardware business. The transaction was completed on 30 January 2018; while HTC will continue to produce its own smartphones, the company has stated that it planned to increase its focus on Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality going forward. On 26 March 2018, HTC reported a quarterly net loss of US$337 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, citing \\"market competition, product mix, pricing, and recognized inventory write-downs\\". The company's transaction with Google will be reflected in its first quarter 2018 numbers. HTC stated that it would use the revenue to further its investments in \\"emerging technologies\\". The company had also cited its increasing VR investments, including its upcoming Vive Pro model, and Vive Focus‚Äîa standalone \\"all-in- one\\" VR headset unveiled in November 2017. In July 2018 HTC has revealed that it has entered into a partnership with games and apps developer and publisher Animoca. This includes product development and joint collaboration in areas such as games, blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, augmented reality and virtual reality. Animoca's games will be pre-installed on HTC devices in the future. On 5 February 2019 HTC released its first \\"Cryptophone\\", focused on providing universal finance through Bitcoin and creating a portal towards realizing a truly decentralized web. On 11 May 2019 HTC announced that its Cryptophone will be the first smartphone to support a bitcoin full node. On 17 September 2019 HTC appointed Yves Maitre, former executive vice president of consumer equipment and partnerships of Orange, as CEO where Cher Wang will continue her role as chairwoman. On 3rd September, 2020 HTC CEO Yves Maitre stepped down from the position citing personal reasons. Co-founder Cher Wang then stepped in and is now the current CEO of HTC. Litigation HTC One History In March 2010, Apple Inc. filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission claiming infringement of 20 of its patents covering aspects of the iPhone user interface and hardware. HTC disagreed with Apple's actions and reiterated its commitment to creating innovative smartphones. HTC also filed a complaint against Apple for infringing on five of its patents and sought to ban the import of Apple products into the US from manufacturing facilities in Asia. Apple expanded its original complaint by adding two more patents. On 10 November 2012, Apple and HTC reached a 10-year license-agreement covering current and future patents held by the two companies. The terms of the agreement remain confidential. Previously, Apple ignored HTC's long held rights over the trade name Touch by calling its new iPod range the same. In February 2013, HTC settled with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concerning lax security on more than 18 million smartphones and tablets it had shipped to customers and agreed to security patches. Corporate information HTC's chairwoman and acting CEO is Cher Wang who is the daughter of the late Wang Yung-ching, founder of the plastics and petrochemicals conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group. Peter Chou serves as head of the HTC Future Development Lab, and HT Cho as Director of the Board and Chairman of HTC Foundation. HTC's CFO is Hui-Ming Cheng. In addition to being chair of HTC, Cher Wang is also acting chair of VIA Technologies. HTC's main divisions, including the IA (Information Appliance) engineering division and the WM (Wireless Mobile) engineering division, are ISO 9001/ISO 14001-qualified facilities. The company's growth has accelerated dramatically since being chosen by Microsoft as a hardware platform development partner for the Windows Mobile operating system (based on Windows CE). HTC also works with Google to build mobile phones running Google's Android mobile OS such as the Nexus One. HTC's sales revenue totalled $2.2 billion for 2005, a 102% increase from the prior year. In 2005 it was listed as the fastest-growing tech company in BusinessWeeks Info Tech 100. HTC invested strongly in research and development, which accounts for a quarter of its employees. The company's North American headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington. HTC runs a software design office in Seattle (near its North American headquarters) where it designs its own interface for its phones. In 2011, HTC also opened a research and development office in Durham, North Carolina, a location the company chose over Seattle and Atlanta, to focus on multiple areas of wireless technology. On 17 February 2010, Fast Company ranked HTC as the 31st most innovative company in the world. On 27 May 2011, in response to customer feedback, HTC announced that they will no longer lock the bootloaders on their Android based phones.

It was released on Polydor Records on 26 January 1998, then reissued on Pond Life on 13 March 2000. In 2003, the album was released in LP format on Universal Records. Its sound is noted for being extremely sparse and minimal; AllMusic called it \\"quite possibly the most quiet and intimate record ever made\\". Hollis found inspiration not in the popular music of the day, but rather in 20th-century classical music and jazz from the late fifties and sixties. The album did not mark a return for Hollis to the music industry or live performance; he stated at the time of the album's release that \\"There won't be any gig, not even at home in the living room. This material isn't suited to play live.\\" The album was recorded as part of a two-album contract with Polydor, along with Talk Talk's 1991 Laughing Stock. At one point, the record was to be entitled Mountains of the Moon and released under the Talk Talk name, but eventually it was decided it should be a self-titled solo project (early promotional CD-Rs and cassettes of the album contain the original details, with the CD-R retaining the attribution to Talk Talk). Engineer Phill Brown, who also recorded Laughing Stock, stated that, compared to the final Talk Talk album, which he considered \\"one of [his] best projects\\" but \\"dark and claustrophobic\\",cybercity.dk he found the solo release \\"the opposite‚Ä¶- open, restful and at times fantastically beautiful\\".

A reissue of the album was released on 18 October 2019 through UMC/Polydor.

It is one of the better known castles in the Netherlands and featured in many television shows set in the Middle Ages. History =Floris V= The history of Muiden Castle begins with Count Floris V who built a stone castle at the mouth of the river in 1280, when he gained command over an area that used to be part of the See of Utrecht.A.T.E. Cruysheer, Het Muiderslot; een archeologische begeleiding en een historische interpretatie, Jaarboek 2005 van de Archeologische afdeling Naerdincklant, pp. 48-55 The Vecht river was the trade route to Utrecht, one of the most important trade towns of that age. The castle was used to enforce a toll on the traders. It is a relatively small castle, measuring 32 by 35 metres with brick walls well over 1.5 metres thick. A large moat surrounded the castle. In 1296, Gerard van Velsen conspired together with Herman van Woerden, Gijsbrecht IV of Amstel, and several others to kidnap Floris V. The count was eventually imprisoned in Muiden Castle. After Floris V attempted to escape, Gerard personally killed the count on the 27th of June 1296 by stabbing him 20 times. The alleged cause of the conflict between the nobles was the rape of Gerard van Velsen's wife by Floris. Henry S. Lucas, The Problem of the Poems concerning the Murder of Count Floris V of Holland, Speculum , Vol. 32, No. 2 (Apr., 1957), pp. 283-298 In 1297, the castle was conquered by Willem van Mechelen, the Archbishop of Utrecht, and by the year 1300 the castle was demolished. =Fourteenth century= A hundred years later (ca. 1370-1386) the castle was rebuilt on the same spot based on the same plan, by Albert I, Duke of Bavaria, who at that time was also the Count of Holland and Zeeland. =P.C. Hooft= The next owner of the castle shows up in the 16th century, when P.C. Hooft (1581-1647), an author, poet and historian took over sheriff and bailiff duties for the area (Het Gooiland). For 39 years he spent his summers in the castle and invited friends, scholars, poets and painters such as Vondel, Huygens, Bredero and Maria Tesselschade Visscher, over for visits. This group became known as the Muiderkring.Hans Kauffmann, Rembrandt und die Humanisten vom Muiderkring, Jahrbuch der Preuszischen Kunstsammlungen, 41. Bd., (1920), p. 60 He also extended the garden and the plum orchard, while at the same time an outer earthworks defense system was put into place. =18th and 19th century= At the end of the 18th century, the castle was first used as a prison, then abandoned and became derelict. Further neglect caused it to be offered for sale in 1825, with the purpose of it being demolished. Only intervention by King William I prevented this. Another 70 years went by until enough money was gathered to restore the castle to its former glory. =Modern times= Muiden Castle is currently a national museum (Rijksmuseum). The inside of the castle, its rooms and kitchens, was restored to look like they did in the 17th century and several of the rooms now house a collection of arms and armour.

Real-time collaborative editing can occur online in web applications such as Microsoft Office on the web (formerly Office Online) ‚Äì which supports online (web-based) simultaneous editing (which Microsoft refers to as \\"Co-Authoring\\") of Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint and other Microsoft Office documents stored on Office.com, OneDrive or SharePoint cloud storage ‚Äì or Google Docs and other G Suite productivity (office suite) apps ‚Äì for online collaborative editing of word processing and other documents stored in Google Drive. Real-time collaborative editing can also occur in hybrid manner, such as with Power Sheet BI for Excel, in offline, web-based, and online collaborative editing in desktop software as well as web-based and mobile apps, which can be synchronized automatically with instant access to version history. Unlike asynchronous (non-real-time, delayed or offline) collaborative editing, such as occurs with revision control systems like Git or Subversion, real-time editing performs automatic, periodic, often nearly instantaneous synchronization of edits of all online users as they edit the document on their own device. This is designed to avoid or minimize edit conflicts. In asynchronous collaborative editing, each user must typically manually submit (publish, push or commit), update (refresh, pull, download or sync) and (if any edit conflicts occur) merge their edits. Due to the delayed nature of asynchronous collaborative editing, multiple users can end up editing the same line, word, element, data, row or field resulting in edit conflicts which require manual edit merging or overwriting, requiring the user to choose which edits to use or (depending on the system and setup) automatically overwriting their edits or other people's edits, with or without a warning.  History of key products  The first instance of a collaborative real-time editor was demonstrated by Douglas Engelbart in 1968, in The Mother of All Demos. Widely available implementations of the concept took decades to appear. Instant Update was released for the classic Mac OS in 1991 from ON Technology. Later, a version for Microsoft Windows was released as well, allowing real-time collaboration across these two operating systems. Instant Update relied on a work group server to coordinate documents updated in real time on multiple clients. The Web 2.0 phenomenon has caused an explosion of interest in browser-based document editing tools. In particular, a product called Writely saw explosive user growth and was bought by Google in March 2006 (what became known as Google Docs and later renamed to Google Drive). It provided simultaneous edits on the entirety of a document, though changes from other users were only reflected after the client program polling the server (every half-minute or so). Another early web-based solution was JotSpotLive, in which line-by-line simultaneous editing was available in near-realtime. However, after Google's purchase of parent company JotSpot in November 2006, the site was closed. Google Sites was launched in February 2007 as a refactoring of JotSpot, but it lacks the multi-user real-time abilities of JotLive. The Synchroedit (rich text) and MobWrite (plain text) projects are two, more recent, open source attempts to fill the gap in real-time browser- based collaborative editing, though still unable to achieve true real-time performance, especially on a large scale architecture. In 2009, Google started beta testing Google Wave, a real-time collaboration environment which Google hoped would eventually displace email and instant messaging. EtherPad was acquired by Google, which allocated the EtherPad team to work within the Wave project. However, Google announced in August 2010 on its blog that it had decided to stop developing Wave as a standalone project, due to insufficient user adoption. After Google released the abandoned EtherPad source code as open source in December 2009, the community took over its development and produced a complete rewrite named Etherpad lite, which is written entirely in JavaScript and built on top of node.js. Other notable tools based on operational transformation technology are CKEditor, and SubEthaEdit.  Technical challenges  The complexity of real-time collaborative editing solutions stems from communication latency. In theory, if communication were instantaneous, then creating a real-time collaborative editor would be no more difficult than creating a single-user editor, because a document could be edited using an algorithm similar to the following: # Request an 'edit document' token from the server # Wait until the server says it's our turn to edit the document # Tell the server how to edit the document # Release the 'edit document' token However, the speed of communication is limited by network latency. This creates a fundamental dilemma: users need their own edits incorporated into the document instantly, but if they are incorporated instantly, then because of communication latency, their edits must necessarily be inserted into different versions of the document. An example illustrates this problem. Suppose Bob and Alice start with a document containing the word Mary. Bob deletes 'M', then inserts 'H', to change the word into Hary. Alice, before she receives either edit from Bob, deletes 'r', then deletes 'a', to change it into My. Both Bob and Alice will then receive edits that were applied to versions of the document that never existed on their own machines. Thus, the challenge of real-time collaborative editing is to figure out exactly how to apply edits from remote users, which were originally created in versions of the document that never existed locally, and which may conflict with the user's own local edits. The most sophisticated solutions solve this problem in a way that does not require a server, does not use locking (all users can freely edit all parts of a document at the same time), and supports any number of users (limited only by the resources of the computers). UNA and SubEthaEdit are examples of two programs that take this approach. While these sophisticated approaches enable the best user experience, a basic collaborative editor can also be created in a client‚Äìserver model. In a client‚Äìserver scenario, one of the editor instances is assigned the role of collaboration server when the document is opened. This server ensures that other editors are kept in sync by determining network latency and acting as a time synchronization server. The server receives timestamped notifications of changes made to the document by other users. It determines how those changes should affect its local copy, and broadcasts its changes to the collaboration pool. In some models, the changes are not reflected on a client until an official response is returned from the server, even if those changes were made locally. This approach, while significantly less powerful, allows for basic collaboration at a relatively low cost. This makes it preferable in situations where processing resources are limited. NetSketch is an example of a program that uses this model. In the past, Microsoft and IBM have worked to add collaboration facilities to their existing architectures.Microsoft Live Communications Marketed as real time but not real time in the sense of this article. Although marketed as real-time collaboration, these 'workspace' approaches require either document locking (so only one person can edit it at a time), or 'reconciliation' of conflicting changes, which is generally found by users to be unsatisfactory.

Early life Born in South Shields, County Durham, Montgomery was educated at Jarrow Grammar School and Bede College at the University of Durham, and became a teacher in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1950. From 1950-58 he served as a councillor on Hebburn urban district council. From 1957‚Äì58, he was National Chairman of the Young Conservatives, having served as Vice-Chairman from 1954‚Äì57. Parliamentary career Having unsuccessfully contested the safe Labour seat of Consett in 1955, he was first elected to the House of Commons for Newcastle upon Tyne East at the 1959 general election with a narrow majority of just 98 votes. He is the only Conservative MP to have ever represented Newcastle East. Montgomery narrowly lost the seat to the Labour Party in 1964. He returned to Parliament at a 1967 by-election for Brierley Hill. Boundary changes which took effect from the February 1974 general election abolished the Brierley Hill constituency. Having unsuccessfully sought selection for South West Staffordshire Montgomery was selected for the new Dudley West constituency which partially replaced it. However, he was unsuccessful, losing the election to Colin Phipps of the Labour Party. His absence from Parliament was short-lived. Later in 1974, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber stood down at the October 1974, and Montgomery was selected to contest the constituency of Altrincham and Sale and was duly elected, and then held the seat until he retired at the 1997 general election. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Margaret Thatcher, during her tenure as Secretary of State for Education, and then as Leader of the Opposition. Family He married Joyce Riddle, a teacher, cricketer and Conservative local councillor; they had no children. Lady Montgomery served as Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Greater Manchester.

J√§gerst√§tter was sentenced to death and executed for his refusal to fight for Nazi Germany. He was later declared a martyr and beatified by the Catholic Church. Life J√§gerst√§tter farmstead in St Radegund J√§gerst√§tter was born in Sankt Radegund, Upper Austria, a small village between Salzburg and Braunau am Inn. He was the child of Rosalia Huber, a chambermaid, and Franz Bachmeier, a farmer. As his parents could not afford a marriage, Franz was first cared for by his grandmother, Elisabeth Huber. His biological father was killed in World War I when Franz was still a child. When his mother married in 1917, Franz was adopted by her husband, Heinrich J√§gerst√§tter. In his youth, Franz gained a reputation for being a wild fellow, but, in general, his daily life was like that of most Austrian peasants. He worked as a farmhand and also as a miner in Eisenerz, until in 1933 he inherited the farmstead of his adoptive father. In that same year, he fathered an out-of-wedlock daughter, Hildegard Auer.Biography of J√§gerst√§tter (in German) On Maundy Thursday of 1936, he married Franziska Schwaninger (4 March 1913‚Äì16 March 2013), a deeply religious woman. After the wedding liturgy, the bridal couple proceeded on a pilgrimage to Rome, where they received a papal blessing from Pope Pius XI. Inspired by his wife, J√§gerst√§tter began to study the Bible and the lives of saints. The marriage produced three daughters: Maria, Louisi, and Rosi. When German troops moved into Austria in March 1938, J√§gerst√§tter rejected the offered position as Radegund mayor. He was the only person in the village to vote against the Anschluss in the plebiscite of 10 April; nevertheless, the local authorities suppressed his dissent and announced unanimous approval. He was dismayed to witness many Catholics in his town supporting the Nazis, writing, \\"I believe there could scarcely be a sadder hour for the true Christian faith in our country\\". Although he was not involved with any political organization and did undergo one brief period of military training, he remained openly anti-Nazi. On 8 December 1940, he joined the Third Order of Saint Francis and from summer 1941 worked as a sacristan at the local parish church, being deferred from military service four times. Drafted for the first time on 17 June 1940, J√§gerstetter, aged 33, was again conscripted into the German Wehrmacht in October and completed his training at the Enns garrison. He refused to take the Hitler oath, but could return home in 1941 under an exemption as a farmer. Faced with his experiences in military service, the suppression of the church, as well as reports on the Nazi T4 \\"euthanasia\\" program, he began to examine the morality of the war. He even proceeded to Linz to discuss this with his bishop but emerged from the conversation saddened that the episcopate seemed afraid to confront the issues.\\"Franz J√§gerst√§tter 1907 ‚Äì 1943 - Martyr\\" Arrest and death Memorial plaque at the former Reichskriegsgericht in Berlin After many delays, J√§gerst√§tter was finally called to active duty on 23 February 1943. By this time, he had three daughters with his wife, the eldest not quite six. He maintained his position against fighting for Nazi Germany and upon entering into the Wehrmacht garrison in Enns on March 1 declared his conscientious objection. His offer to serve as a medic was ignored. He was immediately arrested and placed in custody, first at the Linz remand prison, then from 4 May at Berlin-Tegel. A priest from his village visited him in jail and tried to talk him into serving, but did not succeed. When he heard of the fate of the Austrian priest Father Franz Reinisch, who had been executed for his refusal to take the Hitler oath, he was determined to go the same way. Accused of Wehrkraftzersetzung (undermining of military morale), J√§gerst√§tter was sentenced to death for sedition in a military trial at the Reichskriegsgericht in Berlin-Charlottenburg on 6 July 1943. He was deported to Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison on 9 August, where he was executed by guillotine in the afternoon, aged 36. J√§gerst√§tter's last recorded words before his death were, \\"I am completely bound in inner union with the Lord\\". After the war, in 1946, his ashes were buried at the Sankt Radegund cemetery. Legacy and beatification J√§gerst√§tter was criticized by his countrymen, especially by those who had served in the military, for failing in his duty as a husband and father. The municipality of Sankt Radegund at first refused to put his name on the local war memorial and a pension for his widow was not approved until 1950. Icon depicting Franz J√§gerst√§tter J√§gerst√§tter's fate was not well known until 1964, when US sociologist Gordon Zahn published his biography, In Solitary Witness. Thomas Merton, the famed Trappist monk and peace activist, included a chapter about Franz J√§gerst√§tter in his book Faith and Violence (1968). A 1971 film treatment of his life made for Austrian television, Verweigerung (\\"The Refusal\\") (originally titled Der Fall J√§gerst√§tter), by director Axel Corti starred Kurt Weinzierl. A bronze plaque with his quotation about conscientious objection was dedicated at the Pacifist Memorial in Sherborn, Massachusetts in 1994. His case was a topic of the annual Braunauer Zeitgeschichte-Tage conference in 1995. The death sentence was nullified by the Landgericht Berlin on 7 May 1997. A Stolperstein for J√§gerst√§tter in Sankt Radegund was laid in 2006. In June 2007, Pope Benedict XVI issued an apostolic exhortation declaring J√§gerst√§tter a martyr. On 26 October 2007, he was beatified in a ceremony held by Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins at the New Cathedral in Linz. His feast day is the day of his baptism, 21 May. The documentary, Franz Jaegerstaetter: A Man of Conscience, was released in 2011. A film about J√§gerst√§tter, A Hidden Life, written and directed by Terrence Malick, premiered in May 2019 at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival, and was given a general release in the US on December 13, 2019. The film is inspired by the book titled Franz J√§gerst√§tter: Letters and Writings from Prison, edited by J√§gerst√§tter biographer Erna Putz, with Malick acquiring its adaptation rights for the production.

Its mission is to explore the universe, study its origins and its evolution with two of the most advanced radio facilities in the world: * The NOEMA observatory (NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array), an array of currently eleven 15-meter antennas located in the French Alps on the Plateau de Bure at more than 2550 meters above sea level. NOEMA is the most powerful millimeter observatory of the Northern Hemisphere. * The IRAM 30-meter telescope, located at 2850 meters altitude on Pico Veleta in the Spanish Sierra Nevada (Andalucia, Spain). The telescope is the world's premier single-dish facility for astronomical research in the millimeter wavelength range. Both sites are at high altitude to reduce the absorption by water vapour in Earth's atmosphere. The telescopes are supported by the IRAM offices and laboratories in Granada and Grenoble, respectively. The IRAM headquarters are on the campus of Universit√© Grenoble Alpes near Grenoble. More than 120 scientists, engineers, technicians and administrative personnel work for the IRAM organization. The institute's laboratories cover the complete field of high frequency technology. IRAM staff develop cutting edge technology for the IRAM facilities and to the benefit of the international astronomical community.  Facilities and research  The principal activity of IRAM is the study of mostly cold matter (interstellar molecular gas and cosmic dust) in the solar system, in our Milky Way, and other galaxies out to cosmological distances in order to determine their composition, physical parameters and history. Compared to optical astronomy, which is sensitive to the hot universe (stars are generally a few thousand degrees Celsius), radiotelescopes that operate in the millimeter wavebands, such as NOEMA or the IRAM 30-meter telescope, probe the cold universe (around -250 degrees Celsius). They are able to see the formation of the first galaxies in the universe, to observe super-giant black holes at the center of galaxies, to analyze the chemical evolution and dynamics of nearby galaxies, to detect organic molecules and possible key elements of life and to investigate the formation of stars and the appearance of planetary systems. IRAM's facilities have done pioneering work and made a large number of astronomical discoveries. NOEMA has observed the most distant galaxy known to date. Together with the IRAM 30-meter telescope it made the first complete and detailed radio images of nearby galaxies and their gas. NOEMA also obtained the first image of a gas disk surrounding a double star system (Guilloteau et al. 1994). Its antennas captured for the first time a cavity in one of these disks, a major hint for the existence of a planetary object orbiting the new star and absorbing matter on its trajectory (GG tau, Pi√©tu et al. 2011). The IRAM facilities have discovered one third of the interstellar molecules known to date (published ApJ, 2018, Brett A. McGuire). Both IRAM observatories are part of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a global array of radio telescopes. In 2017, IRAM participated in the observations that lead to the publication of the first ever image of a black hole.  History  IRAM was founded in 1979 and is operated as a French-German-Spanish collaboration. Its partner institutes are the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS, France), the Max Planck Society (MPG, Max Planck Gesellschaft, Germany), and the Instituto Geogr√°fico Nacional (IGN, Spain). Today, the institute is considered a model of scientific multinational cooperation.  Global outreach  IRAM supports the scientific research of more than 5000 astronomers worldwide. The institute maintains close research partnerships with high-profile universities and research organizations in North-America and China as well as with other radio- astronomical facilities including the ALMA observatory in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2016, The University of Michigan Astronomy Department signed into an agreement allowing access to NOEMA .lsa.umich.edu, NOEMA In 2017, the University of Nanjing (China) and the Purple Mountain Observatory (Chinese Academy of Sciences) follow. IRAM also exports its technical and instrumental know-how. Transnational organizations like the European Space Agency benefit from IRAM's developments for their space missions.

The memorial is served by the King Street‚ÄìOld Town Metro station on the Blue and Yellow Lines of the Washington Metro. The station is located about four blocks from the memorial. Early memorial efforts and Washington Memorial Park The idea to construct a Masonic memorial for George Washington was first proposed in 1852 by the Washington area's \\"mother lodge,\\" Fredericksburg Lodge No. 4 (located in Fredericksburg, Virginia).Lichtenstein, p. 27; Brown, George Washington, Freemason, p. 305; Walker, p. 112. Funds were sought from Grand Lodges (state-level Masonic organizations) throughout the United States to construct a memorial Masonic Temple with a large statue in the vestibule.Lichtenstein, p. 27-28. Enough funds were raised to commission a life-size bronze statue of Washington in full Masonic regalia from a sculptor named Powers who was living in Rome, Italy.Lichtenstein, p. 28. The statue reached Alexandria in early 1861, just before the outbreak of the American Civil War. It remained on display in Alexandria until the summer of 1863, when it was moved to Richmond, Virginia. The statue was destroyed in the fire which occurred as Richmond surrendered to the Army of the Potomac on April 3, 1865. Plans for a Masonic memorial moved forward again in 1909 after work on a competing memorial began. The proposed site for the new memorial was Shooter's Hill, which at one time had been seriously considered by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson as the site of the United States Capitol building.Rothery, p. 5; Laughlin, p. 17; Stevens, p. 243.Native Americans used Shooter's Hill as a seasonal base for hunting and fishing as far back as 3,000 BC. The first dwelling built by European settlers was constructed there in 1781. A plantation owner built a mansion on the hill in the 1830s, but it burned to the ground in 1842. A log cabin, a small frame house, and a large brick house occupied the site until 1861. The site also was used as a laundry and barracks after the Civil War. See: Allen, \\"City's Hill Holds 5,000 Years of History,\\" Washington Post, May 22, 1997. On May 8, 1900, citizens of Alexandria formed the \\"Washington Monument Association of Alexandria\\" (WMAA), a nonprofit organization whose mission was to build a memorial to George Washington in the city of Alexandria. Little was accomplished in the organization's first few years of life, but in February 1908 the WMAA purchased an option to buy a tract of land on and around Shooter's Hill and the nearby Alexandria Golf Course.\\"Gets Option on Park Site.\\" Washington Post. February 27, 1908. This tract of land is today approximately bounded by Russell Road, Walnut Street, Upland Street, and Roberts Lane. Most of the land immediately on either side of King Street was subdivided into housing tracts and sold, with on top of Shooter's Hill reserved for a memorial.\\"Monument to Washington.\\" Washington Post. July 1, 1908. The sale of the housing subdivisions paid for the purchase of the entire tract, with enough left over to provide for construction of a memorial. Within a month of the purchase of Shooter's Hill, the WMAA decided to build a park rather than a memorial.\\"Push Public Park Plan.\\" Washington Post. August 5, 1908. About were set aside for the George Washington Memorial Park, while another were set aside for a small memorial within the park. The new subdivision, named Fort Ellsworth (after an American Civil War fort which used to occupy Shooter's Hill), was platted in November 1908, and public streets laid out.\\"Alexandria Park Assured.\\" Washington Post. November 8, 1908.The street built on the southeast corner for Shooter's Hill would later be renamed Callahan Drive. See: \\"Early Construction of the Masonic Memorial.\\" Alexandria Times. March 26 ‚Äì April 2, 2009. Accessed 2011-03-24. Until the 1970s, the star-shaped outline of Fort Ellsworth could be seen from the memorial's tower. Gunpowder, spilled into the soil during the Civil War, served as a rich fertilizer which made the grass far more luxuriant than any surrounding the site of the former fort. But in 1974, the Ellsworth Gardens condominiums were built on top of this site, obliterating what remained of the fort. See: Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 103; \\"Ellsworth Gardens.\\" Washington Post. March 30, 1974. The park was ready for dedication on April 30, 1909‚Äîthe 120th anniversary of the inauguration of Washington as President. Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 (George Washington's Masonic lodge, as well as the lodge he led as a Worshipful Master) was asked to preside over its dedication.\\"Masons Asked to Preside.\\" Washington Post. January 11, 1909. President William Howard Taft, Vice President James S. Sherman, Speaker of the House Joseph Gurney Cannon, Virginia Governor Claude A. Swanson, Virginia Lieutenant Governor J.

Formation of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association There were several reasons why Masonic bodies finally began to build a memorial. The construction of George Washington Memorial Park sparked renewed Masonic interest in building their own memorial. But another reason was the safety of items owned or used by George Washington (\\"Washingtoniana\\") and which were now owned by the Alexandria-Washington lodge. The lodge had suffered several fires over the previous century, and a number of these historic items were destroyed. Constructing a fire resistive building which would more safely house these important items was a major factor in pushing the Masonic memorial forward.Solomon, Mary Jane. \\"The Father of His Fraternity.\\" Washington Post. February 19, 1993. In late 1907 or early 1908, Alexandria Commissioner of Revenue Charles H. Callahan (the deputy master of Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22) proposed to his fellow Masons that, at last, a memorial to George Washington should be built.\\"Work on Alexandria Masonic Temple to Cease for Winter.\\" Washington Post. December 26, 1924.Callahan was born in 1858 at Aquia Mills, Virginia. He married Mary Elizabeth Appich in October 1891. He was a clerk and bookkeeper for his father until 1905, when he was elected deputy commissioner of revenue for the city of Alexandria. He was elected commissioner in 1907. See: \\"Callahan, Charles H.\\", p. 682. Callahan proposed the construction of a $10,000 memorial temple.Shepperson, Charles M. \\"Symbolic Corn, Wine and Oil to Be Poured on Realistic Copy.\\" Washington Post. May 1, 1932. In early 1908, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge formed a \\"local memorial temple committee\\" to research the costs and obstacles involved in building a memorial temple. The committee passed a resolution asking Joseph Eggleston, the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Virginia, to approve the creation of a memorial temple and to assist in creating a national memorial association in which all Masons and Masonic organizations could participate. On May 7, 1909, the Grand Lodge of Virginia called upon all grand lodges in the United States to meet in Alexandria on February 22, 1910, to discuss plans for organizing a George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association whose purpose would be to construct a memorial temple.\\"Temple for Alexandria.\\" Washington Post. February 15, 1910. President Taft, Representative Champ Clark, Secretary of War Jacob M. Dickinson, and Virginia Governor William Hodges Mann all spoke at the February 22 meeting.\\"Taft to Address Masons.\\" Washington Post. February 4, 1910; \\"Temple for Alexandria.\\" Washington Post. February 15, 1910. The George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association (GWMNMA) was formed at this meeting, and plans were adopted to raise $500,000 to go toward the cost of construction and another $500,000 for an endowment and maintenance fund.\\"Masons Plan Temple.\\" Washington Post. February 23, 1910. Thomas J. Shryock, Grand Master of Maryland (and a former Treasurer of Maryland and Brigadier General in the Maryland National Guard), was elected president of the GWMNMA.\\"Masons Announce Plans.\\" Washington Post. February 9, 1912. At this point, the GWMNMA only planned to construct a Masonic temple, not a giant memorial. One floor was to be set aside for use by Masonic lodges, and one or more fire resistive, secure rooms in the temple were to be used for the display of Washingtoniana and historical documents owned by the Alexandria- Washington Lodge. By February 1911, the GWMNMA had ruled out all locations except Alexandria as the site for its memorial temple, and fund-raising activities were being planned.\\"Taft to Meet Masons.\\" Washington Post. February 22, 1911. A more formal association structure was also adopted at this time.\\"Alexandria Will Be Host.\\" Washington Post. February 18, 1911. But except for fund-raising activities, little was done in the association's first five years of activity. =Site selection= Nearly everyone involved in the project in its early years agreed the memorial temple had to be built in Alexandria due to Washington's extensive ties to that city. George Washington Memorial Park seemed a good location, but this park was still privately owned by the WMAA.\\"Park May Get Temple.\\" Washington Post. September 29, 1915. In September 1915, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge offered to buy several lots on top of Shooter's Hill for $1,000. At about the same time, the city of Alexandria discussed whether it should ask the WMAA to turn over the remainder of George Washington Memorial Park to the city. The lodge suggested that of the eastern slope of George Washington Memorial Park be retained as a public park, while the rest of the tract could be used for any purposes the city wanted. This plan was not acted on. By December 1915, the city had purchased all of Shooter's Hill and George Washington Memorial Park from the WMAA except for a area (lots 29 through 38, inclusive, of block 5)This area included the crest of Shooter's Hill and the north slope extending toward Park Road. on the north slope of the hill. In October or December 1915 (sources disagree on the date), the Alexandria-Washington Lodge purchased the north slope of Shooter's Hill (an area about ) for $1,000.\\"The George Washington National Masonic Memorial Association.\\" New Age Magazine. March 1917, p. 127.\\"Temple of Masons Washington Shrine.\\" Washington Post. April 1, 1917.Riddell, John P. \\"Charles H. Callahan... A Man of Vision, A Man of Action.\\" The Light. Fall 2000, p. 6. Under the terms of the conveyance of the deed, the Masons were required to build a memorial temple (costing no less than $100,000) to George Washington at the top of the hill within 10 years or they would be forced to turn over the land to the city of Alexandria. With land secured, the Masons began making plans to build a memorial. In 1917, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge reported that the intent remained to construct a $500,000 building to house the Washingtoniana (valued at $2 million) which the lodge held. The GWMNMA had raised $5,000, and another $20,000 in donations was anticipated. GWMNMA President Thomas J. Shyrock died on February 3, 1918, and Louis Arthur Watres (former Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania and a former Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania) was elected president as his successor. At its annual meeting just two weeks later, the association approved the employment of an architect to begin developing plans for the memorial. Watres departed for New York City to interview architects. On the train, he met Harvey Wiley Corbett of the New York City firm of Helmle & Corbett (and coincidentally a Freemason).Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 8-9. The GWMNMA selected Corbett to be the chief architect.Caemmerer, p. 1140.Stoller, p. 42.\\"$4,000,000 Memorial to Washington.\\" Manufacturers' Record. November 8, 1923, p. 91. By February 1922, the GWMNMA had radically revised its plans for the memorial. Now the association planned a building which would cost $1.5 million, with another $400,000 set aside for landscaping the grounds and $500,000 as an endowment for perpetually maintaining the memorial.\\"Plans Big Temple to First President.\\" Washington Post. February 20, 1922.\\"$2,400,000 Memorial Engrosses Masons.\\" Washington Post. February 21, 1922. The directors of the GWMNMA also approved a new charter for the organization, inspected the building site, and approved blueprints for the building. The state of Virginia approved the revised charter for the GWMNMA on March 16, 1922.\\"Virginia Charters Masonic Temple.\\" Washington Post. March 17, 1922. =Early designs= Model of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial in 1922. The model shows clear differences in the design of the tower and landscaping from the final building. Corbett planned a three-story memorial temple topped by a three- story tower. The first three floors (which constituted the temple and the base of the tower) would be built in the Neoclassical style, while the tower would be a variation on the setbacks popular in Modern architecture. The structure was to be built entirely of masonry, with almost no metal used in its construction (except for reinforcing rods in the concrete). The rationale for this decision was that a building constructed purely of stone would be the most permanent structure possible. The firm of Osgood & Osgood of Grand Rapids, Michigan, was the consulting engineer.Reynolds, p. 154. Daniel E. Moran (of the firm Moran, Maurice & Proctor of New York) designed the building's foundation; Gunvald Aus was the structural engineer; the firm of Clarke, McMullen & Riley (of New York) was the mechanical engineer; and Carl Rust Parker of Olmsted Brothers was the landscape architect. The general contractor was the Percy Cranford Co., but the actual masonry work was done by the Samuel Miller Co. (both companies were located in Washington, D.C.). Corbett's initial design was for a memorial about high.Corbett, Harvey W. \\"Architectural Models of Cardboard, Part II.\\" Pencil Points. May 1922, p. 32. Corbett drew his inspiration from the restoration of the lighthouse at the port of Ostia Antica near Rome.Clute, p. 19. The first floor was occupied by a main hall with a colonnade on either side and clerestory windows, at the back of which a large statue of Washington would reside. Historic murals would be painted on the walls. To the right and left of the main hall would be large meeting rooms (one for the use of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge and one for use by other Masonic bodies). To the left of the main hall there would also be a small room which would contain a replica of the original Masonic lodge room in which Washington himself had presided.Corbett, p. 32-33. Additional details and apparent design changes were revealed in July 1922. Although the building was still just in height, the press now reported that the building would be built specifically in the Greek and Romanesque Revival styles and be constructed of white marble and white concrete.\\"Begin Mason Shrine to First President.\\" Washington Post. July 1, 1922.\\"Masons Raise Half of $4,000,000 for Washington Shrine.\\" Washington Post. February 22, 1924. The atrium of the building (as the first floor main hall was now called) was now slated to contain space along the walls which could be used by Grand Lodges to memorialize their prominent members, while the rooms around the atrium would be dedicated to the various Masonic \\"appendant bodies\\" (jurisdictional bodies, social groups, youth and women's organizations, etc.). The plan called for the second floor to be used as an art gallery as well as a museum, and for the museum to not only honor Washington but also other famous Masons from Virginia. The memorial was still intended to house Washingtoniana and contain a replica of the original Alexandria-Washington Lodge's meeting room. A major revision to the memorial plans was made in February 1923. The GWMNMA approved constructing the building entirely of granite (rather than marble and concrete), a change which increased the cost of the structure to $3 million.\\"Memorial Building to Be Solid Granite.\\" Washington Post. February 23, 1923. Including landscaping and the endowment, the total cost of the structure had risen to $4 million.\\"Officers Elected by Masonic Body.\\" Washington Post. February 24, 1923. These plans were revised and elaborated on again by April 1923. Now the memorial was to stand high.Osgood, S. Eugene. \\"George Washington National Masonic Memorial.\\" The American Tyler-Keystone. March 1923, p. 50. The atrium on the first floor was specified to be wide by deep. With the clerestory windows, this hall would be in height. Meeting rooms would still surround the atrium. The second story, now in size with a high ceiling and extensive windows (to let in large amounts of natural light), was still slated to house the Washington museum. The purpose of the third floor was not yet agreed upon. The tower above the third floor now contained an observation deck forming a seventh and ultimate floor at the top of the tower. The new plans specified that terraces would lead from the front steps of the memorial down to the street below. The cost, however, was still budgeted for $4 million. The final major change in the memorial came in early 1924. The height of the tower had been decreased at some point to . But in February 1924, architect Corbett raised the tower's height back to . Construction of the building =Building the foundation= Given the size and weight of the memorial, even in its early design stages, a solid foundation for the structure was critical. An initial test borehole into Shooter's Hill (which reached a depth of ) found no bedrock, leading to concerns that the site might not be a suitable location for the building. Daniel E. Moran, the foundation engineer, further investigated the earth beneath the building. Moran drilled below the lowest point of the foundation and found gravel, hard clay, and sand. Soil experts in New York City and with the United States Geological Survey analyzed the soil and provided a guarantee (backed up by a bond) that no settling of the building would occur due to soil conditions. Ground for the memorial was broken at noon on June 5, 1922. Louis Watres, president of the association, and Charles H. Callahan, vice president, broke ground in a driving rain. The shovel and pick used to break ground, as well as four small stones from the first two spades of earth turned, were preserved by the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. Excavation of the memorial's foundation began a few days later, with Cranford Paving Co. of Washington, D.C., doing the work.\\"Many Companies Assisted In Building Great Temple.\\" Washington Post. May 12, 1932. The foundation was roughly hemispherical to provide the greatest stability, and of the top of hill removed (lowering the elevation to just ) in order to accommodate the wide by long foundation.Riddell, J.P. \\"How High is the Memorial?\\" The Light. Winter 2000, p. 5. To ensure that the clay remained damp and did not dry out, which would cause the building to settle, a concrete pad was laid on top of the clay. This pad was deep in the center but only deep on the edges, and consisted of of concrete and of reinforcing steel rods. The pad was allowed to set for several months before work began on the foundation itself.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 10. The basement of the building was as large as the first two floors combined and was intended to house the structure's mechanical plant.\\"Memorial Site Once Was Land of Washington.\\" Washington Post. June 11, 1935. Although steam shovels were used to excavate the foundation, the earth was carried away by mule-drawn wagons.\\"Early Construction of the Masonic Memorial.\\" Alexandria Times. March 26 ‚Äì April 2, 2009. Accessed 2011-03-24. A wide road was constructed to the top of Shooter's Hill to permit the transport of earth off the site and construction materials to the hilltop. By July 1922, the GWMNMA had received $700,000 in donations and another $900,000 in pledges. Some time in the spring of 1922, the GWMNMA also obtained title to the tract encompassing the rest of Shooter's Hill. About of the tract, valued at $1 million, was purchased from the city of Alexandria at almost no cost (essentially making it a gift from the city). The total size of the tract owned by the Masons was now . By January 1923 the foundation was almost completed and the granite walls for the first floor were rising. Work proceeded very rapidly through June.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 17. By February 1923, $1 million had been spent on constructing the foundation and walls and on landscaping. Topsoil for the landscaping came from the Earl Strong Co. of Alexandria, the grass seed from O.M. Scotts and Sons of Ohio, and other trees, shrubs and landscaping products from C.F. Armiger of Washington, D.C. Revenues easily exceeded these expenditures, as $1.8 million had been received in donations and pledges. The same month, the GWMNMA expanded its board of directors from nine to 12. By April 1923, the foundation had been fully excavated and the foundation walls constructed.Lusk, George L. \\"Annual Meeting of the George Washington National Masonic Memorial.\\" The American Tyler-Keystone. April 1923, p. 72. The Washington Post reported that the concrete foundation was the largest ever cast in a single piece.\\"Washington Temple Work Starts Again.\\" Washington Post. March 31, 1928. The foundation (of articulate girder design) was in size, thick, and contained of concrete. Plows pulled by mules had reshaped the side of the hill into its terraced form, and most of the landscaping was now done. Total cash donations received by April 1923 totaled more than $1 million. Concrete for the first floor was poured in June 1923 and once it had set, the eight green granite marble columns in the atrium were set in place. Each green marble column was high and in diameter when finished. To prevent the columns from twisting or slipping, a mortise and tenon was used. A mortise approximately deep was created in the floor and a tenon carved on the bottom of the column base. A small amount of mortar mixed with small flat discs of metal was used to help fix the tenon into the mortise. Between the base and the first drum (or section of the column), between the drums and between the top drum and the capital were placed wedge-shaped thin sheets of lead to inhibit slippage.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 29. By October 15, the first floor and granite outer walls were complete. =Laying of the cornerstone= Laying of the cornerstone of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial in Alexandria, Virginia, on November 1, 1923. Laying of the memorial's cornerstone occurred on November 1, 1923. Planners had initially proposed that cornerstone be laid on November 4, 1923‚Äîthe 170th anniversary of George Washington's initiation into Freemasonry. But because November 4 fell on a Sunday in 1923, the ceremony was scheduled for November 1. The ceremony almost did not occur. A short time before the event, contractors discovered that the cornerstone for the memorial had been cut too small. A new cornerstone was quickly fashioned and completed just in time. Alexandria Mayor William Allen Smoot declared a holiday, and all businesses closed except for banks and the U.S. post office. The United States Navy light cruiser and a U.S. Navy destroyer anchored at the Alexandria torpedo factory as part of the festivities.\\"Cruiser Richmond Will Arrive Today to Honor Masons.\\" Washington Post. October 30, 1923. Trains ran every three minutes into the city of Alexandria in order to accommodate the crowds. An estimated 14,000 Masons, dignitaries, United States armed forces personnel, police, and others marched in a parade from the Alexandria waterfront to Shooter's Hill to kick off the event.\\"14,000 to March as Masons Lay Memorial Cornerstone.\\" Washington Post. October 31, 1923. During the parade, four United States Army Air Corps planes circled overhead. Among the dignitaries present at the 1:00 P.M. cornerstone-laying event were President Calvin Coolidge, now-Chief Justice of the United States William Howard Taft, Virginia Governor Elbert Lee Trinkle, and Alexandria Mayor Smoot.Price, Harry N. \\"President to Lay Stone For Masonic Memorial.\\" Washington Post. November 1, 1923.\\"14,000 Expected in Line of Masonic Procession.\\" Washington Post. November 1, 1923. Charles H. Callahan was master of ceremonies, and the Rt. Rev. James Edward Freeman, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, provided the invocation and benediction. President Coolidge laid the cornerstone using the same trowel Washington used on September 18, 1793, to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol building (the trowel was owned by the Alexandria-Washington Lodge). Loudspeakers were used to broadcast the speeches of President Coolidge and the other speakers to the crowd, and a temporary radio station (operated by radio station WCAP) was set up on Shooter's Hill to broadcast the proceedings nationwide. (Both the loudspeakers and temporary radio station were the same which President Warren G. Harding had used during the laying of the cornerstone for the Lincoln Memorial.) Every U.S. state deposited an item into the cornerstone. Other items deposited in the cornerstone were an American flag; a bronze medal celebrating the inauguration of Warren G. Harding; a bronze plaque containing the names of the architects, consulting architects, landscape architects, engineers, and contractors working on the memorial; a Christian Bible; a lambskin apron; a copy of William Joseph Williams' 1794 portrait of George Washington in Masonic regalia; several books and pamphlets concerning the life of Washington and the history of Freemasonry in America; and the names of the board of directors and officers of the GWMNMA. Beneath the cornerstone was another container, which held several dimes, copies of the Constitution, copies of the Declaration of Independence, books, and other items. =Construction milestones= Construction proceeded slowly after the cornerstone was laid. This was because construction stopped every winter to ensure that the memorial remained free of moisture, frost damage, and the effects of cooling (to improve the fit between stones).\\"$375,000 Expended on Masonic temple on Shooters Hill.\\" Washington Post. May 25, 1925.\\"George Washington Temple Work Will Be Resumed May 1.\\" Washington Post. April 20, 1924. The Helmle & Corbett architectural firm did an extensive study of stone buildings in Europe, and determined that working during good weather was the best way to construct a durable building. During 1923, the GWMNMA raised another $500,000 in cash donations, which brought the total received to $2 million. The granite for the memorial came from quarries in New Hampshire, and was provided by the Maine & New Hampshire Granite Corp. Some of these blocks were as much as long. By the time of the GWMNMA's annual meeting in February 1924, construction on the first floor was almost complete. The first five terraces above the street (the \\"lower terrace\\") were built using Potomac bluestone for the walls, while the walks were graveled. The topmost sixth terrace (the \\"upper terrace\\", which encircled the building and its main entrance) was constructed with Conway Pink Granite for a base. The base was high and thick. The upper portion of this wall was concrete. More than of concrete and of steel reinforcing bars were used in this part of the wall.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 26.Potomac bluestone, also known as \\"Potomac Blue Stone\\" and \\"Sykesville Gneiss\\", is a 500 million year old schistose gneiss that contains garnet, mica, and quartz. Leaching of the garnet from the rock over time leaves the stone looking rusty in color, not blue. It is a commonly used building material throughout the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. See: Moore and Jackson, p. 5, 62. The GWMNMA believed that the second floor would be finished by the end of the construction season in the fall of 1924, and that the entire structure would be done by late 1927 or early 1928. The association also decided that a statue of Washington should be placed in the memorial atrium, and that this statue should be a marble copy of Jean-Antoine Houdon's 1788 statue of George Washington (which stood in the rotunda of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond). In May 1924, the GWMNMA resodded the terrace and spent $6,000 on a new gateway and entrance to the memorial at the foot of Shooter's Hill. A damaged column was donated to a local veterans group to create this memorial to World War I veterans near the GWMNM. The 1924 construction year ended in December with the installation of eight green marble columns (each weighing ) in the first floor atrium. Each column was high and in diameter,Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 27. and arrived at Alexandria's Union Station by train from Redstone, New Hampshire. One columnar section was damaged, and given to the Ladies Auxiliary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). The VFW turned it into a memorial to American war dead, and erected it in front of Alexandria's Union Station. In December 1924, it was estimated that the building would be complete in three to six years. Work on the building slowed in 1925 due to the difficult nature of completing the roof and raising the tower. About of pink Conway granite (also quarried near Redstone) was received in May 1925 and used to build the memorial hall on the second floor. The walls of the hall were already high, and about of granite needed to be raised on the northeast and south sides of the hall to complete them. (They were when finished in December 1925.) Sixteen columns of St. Genevieve marble, quarried in Missouri, were procured and placed around the perimeter of the second floor auditorium to help support the auditorium roof. Each column was high and in diameter, and weighed .Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 37. Once the columns were in place, a jack arch was constructed above them. The arch had two cross-members (each consisting of five stones weighing a total of ) supported by four wide, long steel rods placed in shallow grooves on the underside.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 40. The GWMNMA anticipated spending $595,000 in construction funds in 1925, and raised another $500,000 in cash donations.\\"Masons of Nation Have First Meeting in Alexandria Fane.\\" Washington Post. February 23, 1926. In 1926, the GWMNMA appropriated another $500,000 to continue construction on the memorial.\\"Masonic Memorial Group Will Open Convention Monday.\\" Washington Post. February 18, 1926. The first event held in the memorial was the February 22, 1926, GWMNMA annual meeting. The group reported that $2 million in cash donations had been received thus far, and $1.8 million expended. Eight pink Conway granite columns‚Äîeach high and weighing ‚Äîfor the portico were raised into position in October 1926, nearly completing this portion of the structure.\\"Columns in Place for Masonic Temple in Alexandria Park.\\" Washington Post. October 18, 1926. Also nearing completion was a massive bas-relief sculpture of Washington's head in profile, designed by sculptor Gail Sherman Corbett (wife of architect Harvey W. Corbett).American Art Annual, p. 473.\\"Woman Dares Dizzy Heights Carving Washington Head.\\" Popular Mechanics. September 1927, p. 417. G. Fred Coles, who helped execute the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial, did the carving of the sculpture on- site in the summer of 1927 from Corbett's maquette. At the group's February 1927 meeting, the GWMNMA officers reported raising another $125,000 in cash donations.\\"Alexandria Session of Memorial Group Reelects Watres.\\" Washington Post. February 23, 1927. Six months later, the roof over the first three floors was put in place. The concrete roof was designed by Gunvald Aus, who also designed the Woolworth Building in New York City. Pouring of the concrete roof began on August 22, 1927,\\"Masonic Memorial Construction Work Nearing Completion.\\" Washington Post. August 13, 1927. and was completed on August 30.\\"Pouring Concrete for Masonic Roof Completed Today.\\" Washington Post. August 30, 1927. Steel for the roof was provided by Concrete Steel Co. of Washington, D.C. The Vulcanite Portland Cement Co. of Philadelphia provided the cement, and Cranford Construction Co. poured the roof. A total of of steel reinforcing rods were used in the roof, which contained of concrete. The roof was wide and long‚Äîreportedly the largest concrete roof in the world at the time. The roof was supported by four steel-reinforced concrete beams, each beam long and deep. Each beam varied from in thickness, contained of steel reinforcing rods, and weighed ). The beams were supported at the front of the building by four of the pink Conway granite columns. At the four corners of the roof were concrete piers, each in size. Spandrel beams between the columns‚Äî wide at the bottom, wide at the top, and deep‚Äîalso supported the roof. The roof was waterproofed, sealed, and covered with copper sheeting by the New York Roofing Co. and the Ehret-Warren Co.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 30. In August 1927, it was believed the building would be finished in another three to five years. At its February 1928 annual meeting, the GWMNMA agreed to spend another $500,000 in the coming year on construction costs.\\"Masons to Discuss Financing Temple on Shooters' Hill.\\" Washington Post. February 2, 1928.\\"Grand Lodge Votes $10,000 for Doors for Masonic Fane.\\" Washington Post. February 20, 1928. The association also agreed to increase the endowment fund to $1.5 million, for a total cost of building, grounds, and endowment of $5 million. At this time, it was estimated that the building could be completed if another $500,000 was raised in 1929. The Grand Lodge of the state of Virginia announced at the meeting that it had agreed to fund the construction of bronze doors for the memorial at a cost of $10,000. At the close of the meeting, the GWMNMA established a formal dedication date of 1932 for the memorial.\\"Washington Memorial Temple Heads Elected.\\" Washington Post. February 23, 1928.

When work on the structure began again in March 1929, the terrace and lawns were resodded. The first Masonic degrees were conferred in the unfinished memorial in mid-October 1929.\\"Alexandria Masons Plan Temple Rites.\\" Washington Post. August 5, 1929.

With so many skilled workers unemployed due to the Great Depression, the association was able to hire more men at lower wages than before. By February 1930, the tower section had risen to above elevation, more than the construction schedule anticipated.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 48. At the GWMNMA annual meeting, the association voted to establish a $1 million endowment fund to maintain the memorial after it was completed.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 48-49. In 1930, the association spent $225,000 on the memorial.\\"Work on Exterior of Temple Is Ended.\\" Washington Post. February 9, 1931. That same year, GWMNMA President Watres donated a large Celesta-like set of chimes for the memorial's tower.\\"The George Washington National Masonic Memorial.\\" The New Age Magazine. February 1957, p. 117. The tower was completed, and floors for the eighth, ninth, and tenth levels installed.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 49. Work on the exterior of the memorial ended on February 8, 1931.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 53. The Grand Chapter of Virginia of Royal Arch Masonry donated the aluminum double-keystone symbol and light at the top of the building. The fixture, the largest of its kind in the world at the time, was in place by February 1929 but not yet illuminated (as exterior lighting systems were still being installed). The $17,000 light fixture is high, made of aluminum, and has its own independent power supply. Claude Haynes, a steelworker employed on the memorial since 1923 and a member of Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22, completed the light by installing the aluminum sheeting on it on February 8. Construction of decorative items, flooring, landscape drainage, marble walls, and plumbing continued throughout 1931 and was expected to be complete by February 1932. Work on the outbuilding housing the memorial's boiler room began in late March 1931.\\"Workers to Start on Memorial Unit.\\" Washington Post. March 21, 1931. The brick building was constructed by the Temple B. Greenstreet Co. of Washington, D.C., and the brick smokestacks built by the Alphonse Custodis Co. of New York. A steam tunnel square and long carried heat to the building.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 54. The outbuilding's two low-pressure boilers and the memorial's interior radiators were supplied and installed by the American Radiator Co. Interior heating and ventilation units and ductwork were provided by the B.F. Sturtevant Co., Benjamin F. Shore Co., and Buffalo Forge Co. Modern thermostats provided by Johnson Service Co. were used to control the heating and cooling. The furnaces used heating oil for fuel, and were installed by the Automatic Heating Corporation of Washington, D.C.\\"Finest Materials Used in Structure.\\" Washington Post. May 12, 1932. =Dedication= The George Washington Masonic National Memorial was dedicated on May 12, 1932. Planners had hoped for a dedication date of February 22, 1932‚Äîthe 200th anniversary of Washington's birth. But the structure was not ready in time, as many of the interior details had not yet been agreed on or installed, electrical and plumbing work had not yet reached the third floor, and the George Washington National Bicentennial Commission had already scheduled numerous programs for February. Initially, May 13‚Äîthe 325th anniversary of the founding of the English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia‚Äîwas chosen as the date for the dedication. But since the number 13 was considered unlucky, May 12 was chosen instead.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 56-57. Even with an extra two months, the contractors still rushed to finish the building.\\"Masonic Dedication Plans Being Rushed.\\" Washington Post. April 23, 1932. The huge granite steps leading up to the main entrance were not in place (and would not be until 1940). Among the rooms being prepared at the last minute was the 1,000-seat circular auditorium at the rear of the second floor. Workers laid a cement floor for the auditorium (although this would later be replaced with marble). The marble wall material in the auditorium came from the Hilgartner Marble Co. of Baltimore, while the seating and woodwork came from the American Seating Co. of Grand Rapids. The fan-shaped ceiling and the frieze in the auditorium were designed by Louis Ludwig of Washington, D.C., while the installation of the ceiling and the frieze was done by the A.W. Lee Co. of Washington. Contractors were also busy installing sashes, windows and ventilation grillwork throughout the building, and laying a cement floor in the memorial hall on the second floor. Bronze was used for the sashes, doors, doorjambs and other exterior work where connection to the granite was required, and these items were installed by the William H. Jackson Co. of New York. The interior and exterior ironwork was supplied by the Alexandria Iron Works and the Washington Stair and Ornamental Iron Co. Other than the auditorium, no attempt was made to complete the first floor, the lodge rooms on the second floor or any of the tower rooms in time for the dedication. The memorial had been constructed without incurring any debt. From the start of the project, the Masonic bodies involved in the memorial's construction resolved not to sign any contract or begin any work until the money for such efforts was in hand.\\"Memorial to Date Free of All Debts.\\" Washington Post. May 12, 1932. At the time of the dedication, not a single bond had been sold or loan sought to fund the building's construction. A number of special events marked the dedication ceremony. More than 100 special trains carried an estimated 150,000 spectators into Alexandria. Many attendees slept in railway sleeping cars (which remained parked in the city's rail yards) because hotel accommodations were lacking. The U.S. Navy sailed the historic wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate to Alexandria for the dedication.\\"Old Frigate to Aid Masonic Ceremony.\\" Washington Post. April 25, 1932. Three United States Coast Guard cutters and a U.S. Navy submarine also anchored in the Potomac River for the ceremony.\\"Temple Dedication Plans Completed.\\" Washington Post. May 11, 1932. The United States Post Office Department established a special temporary ceremonial post office at the site of the memorial to postmark letters and postcards with the memorial's name and location and the date of the dedication ceremony.\\"Memorial Postal Station Decreed.\\" Washington Post. May 8, 1932. (More than 200,000 letters were postmarked at the ceremonial station that day.)\\"200,000 Letters Sent In Memorial Cachet.\\" Washington Post. May 14, 1932. The United States House of Representatives adjourned because most House members were attending the dedication event.\\"Most of House Members Will Attend Dedication.\\" Washington Post. May 12, 1932. Most members of the United States Senate also went to the dedication, as did a number of foreign ambassadors. A continuous heavy rain dampened the May 12 festivities. Only about 20,000 people (rather than the anticipated 150,000) lined Alexandria's streets to view the parade. Originally estimated to incorporate 20,000 participants, only 15,000 marched in the parade through Alexandria to the memorial prior to the dedication ceremony. More than 5,000 U.S. military personnel and 3,000 Knights Templar (the third part of the York Rite system of Masonic degrees) marched in the procession. The contingents took more than two hours to pass the reviewing stand. Representatives from every branch of Freemasonry in the U.S. attended and many representatives from overseas Masonic lodges were also present. President Hoover and nearly his entire Cabinet attended the dedication. When the President and his party arrived at the memorial site, the Constitution, the three Coast Guard ships and a battery of the 16th Field Artillery fired a 21-gun salute.\\"Lofty Temple Dedicated By Masonic Rite.\\" Washington Post. May 13, 1932. Due to the heavy rain, the ceremony was moved from the portico of the memorial to the newly completed auditorium. Several items of Washingtoniana were employed during the dedication. Among these were the Bible which Washington used when initiated into Fredericksburg Lodge No. 4 in 1752, the trowel and gavel Washington used while laying the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol building, the Bible on which Washington took the presidential oath of office and a silver urn made by Paul Revere which contained a lock of Washington's hair.\\"Masons to Display Relics.\\" Washington Post. April 4, 1932. A special Masonic ritual was written for the dedication. The ceremony incorporated a high model of the memorial (manufactured by inmates at the Lorton Reformatory), and the pouring of wine, oil and corn (Masonic symbols) from gold and silver pitchers onto the model. The pitchers were made by metalsmith Olaf Saugstadt. The invocation was given by the Rt. Rev. W. Bertrand Stevens, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. The benediction was given by Dr. William J. Morton, Rector of Christ Church, Alexandria (the church where Washington worshipped). Construction of the interior A portion of the Grotto room on the third floor of the memorial, the first room finished in the tower. =1930s= Construction on some of the exterior and nearly all of the interior of the memorial continued after its May 1932 dedication. Sheet metal for interior window sashes, doorjambs and other moldings, fixtures and fittings was provided by G.O. Robertson of Delaware; Ernest Gichner of Washington, D.C.; and the E. Van Norden Co. of New York. The Hires-Turner Glass Co. of Rosslyn, Virginia, provided the windows and stained glass. The lighting fixtures were supplied by the Sterling Bronze Works, while electrical supplies were furnished by the National Electrical Supply Co. of Washington and A.L. Ladd of Alexandria. Four firms oversaw the plumbing and sewage work: Earl Riley, the D.C. Engineering Co., Potomac Clay Works and the Thos. Somerville Co. The interior heavy hardware as well as some heavy internal equipment was supplied by Henry H. Meyer & Co. of Washington, D.C., while lighter hardware and fixtures were supplied by Worth Hulfish & Sons of Alexandria, Baldwin-Stuart Co. of Hartford, Connecticut and Sargent & Co. of New York. Many of the non-marble floors were covered in cork (provided and installed by the David E. Kennedy Co.) and carpeting was provided by Woodward & Lothrop (the department store chain). Acoustic tile was used in many rooms to dampen the echoes produced by the granite walls. This tile was provided by the George P. Little Co. Terrazzo (faux marble flooring) work was done by the V. Foscato Co. of New York. Much of the interior woodwork was supplied by W.A. Smoot & Co. of Alexandria. Interior painting was done by the W.W. MacCallum Co. of Alexandria, while the terracotta (unglazed baked ceramic) decorations were provided by Ernest Simpson of Alexandria. The aluminum for interior work was supplied by the Aerocrete Corporation and worked and molded into forms by the Aluminum Company of America. Gold vein and Tennessee pink marble were used to line the walls of the first floor atrium and the second floor memorial hall and ceilings on both floors were plastered. But by the end of 1933, no heating had been installed in the second floor hall.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 63. Despite the immediate flurry of work on the memorial after its dedication, construction and decoration of the interior slowed significantly over the next two decades. The Great Depression and World War II left both funds and building materials in short supply. The association wished to complete the memorial hall, the north lodge room and the Alexandria- Washington replica lodge room on the second floor of the memorial. To complete the rooms and hallways leading to them would cost about $193,000. Although fund-raising for the effort began, in 1936 the organization learned that it had to complete the library and elevators in the tower first.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 63-64. In February 1931, Florence M. Lemert, widow of Rae John Lemert, Grand Historian of the Grand Lodge of Montana, donated more than 6,000 books and manuscripts about Masonic history and Masonry to the memorial as a means of founding a national Masonic library.Tatsch, p. 85; Bessel, Paul M. \\"Library Corner.\\" The Light. Spring 1999, p. 6. With these books in danger of deterioration, a library had to be constructed immediately and at least one elevator installed in order to reach the library room in the tower. Additional landscaping had to be done in order to reduce the fire danger in the area, walls had to be erected around the land to prevent the public from cutting across the property and roads had to be re-graveled and maintained. In 1935, the GWMNMA set aside the fourth floor as a \\"States Memorial Hall\\" (where each state's Grand Lodge could recognize its famous Masons), the sixth floor as a Masonic library and the eighth floor as a museum. The third, fifth and seventh floors had not yet been assigned a function. But these plans were not carried out. After the death of Louis Watres in June 1937, Dr. Elmer R. Arn, Past Grand Master of Ohio, was elected president of the association as his successor.\\"Dr. Arn Heads Masonic Memorial Unit for Fourth Term.\\" Washington Post. February 24, 1942. Four large lighting sconces were added to the second floor memorial hall in 1938, with the $4,000 cost of their installation paid for by the General Grand Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 66. In 1939, the granite steps leading up to the portico, the walls containing the patio which surrounds the memorial and the stone balustrade for the granite steps were installed.\\"High Masonic Chiefs to Meet Here Friday.\\" Washington Post. February 18, 1940. Several hundred plants were also added to the landscaping. =1940s= The U.S. Dept. of Commerce donated equipment in 1942 to have the exterior of the building and the keystone light atop it lit. In February 1941, the association reported its first big fundraising season since the memorial's dedication, receiving $100,000 in cash donations.\\"$100,000 Given to Washington Memorial Unit.\\" Washington Post. February 23, 1941. In 1941, the association raised an additional $70,000, leaving it with total funds on hand of $225,000. By now, the total cost of completing the structure had risen to $6 million. The GWMNMA agreed to spend $60,000 in 1942 in order to finish the south lodge room on the second floorBrown, George Washington, Freemason, p. 427. and dedicate it to the Blue Lodge. The sum also would cover the cost of finishing the room in the southwest corner of the second floor to house the Alexandria-Washington Lodge's Washingtoniana. Five empty lots on Shooter's Hill were also purchased in 1942, so that a large building could not be built next to the memorial. Additionally, the United States Department of Commerce provided, free of charge, equipment for lighting the building and tower as an aid to aviation. The association paid to have the equipment installed. In February 1942, Representative Sol Bloom donated an oil painting of Washington in full Masonic regalia to the memorial that year as well. Bloom was a member of Pacific Lodge No. 233 in the state of New York and had served as director of the Washington Bicentennial Commission. Artist Hattie Elizabeth Burdette painted the picture in 1932. Actor Tefft Johnson modeled for the portrait, posing in the Masonic apron and wearing the same jewel Washington himself had worn. The chair in the painting also belonged to Washington and the pedestal and background cloth belonged to the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. The painting had been used to advertise the Washington Bicentennial and Bloom donated it to the memorial in memory of his wife (who had died in 1941).Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 67. The Blue Lodge room and Alexandria-Washington Lodge replica room were finished in late 1942. During the following year, one of the granite columns in the memorial cracked and was repaired. Work on the interior did not really begin in earnest until after the war. It was not until May 1945 that the room dedicated to the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (the Shriners) on the north side of the first floor was begun.\\"Shriners' Room Is Dedicated in Alexandria.\\" Washington Post. May 22, 1945. Placed in the finished room was an original oil painting of Shrine co-founder William J. Florence (valued at $5,000), a copy of the Shrine's Ritual in the handwriting of co-founder Walter M. Fleming, a collection of jewels, and other items.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 68. In time, the Shriners would furnish two more rooms on ground floor at a total cost of $168,000. In 1946, the association received a major donation of about $154,700 which went to its maintenance fund (which now had to be at least $3 million to generate enough funds to keep the structure maintained).\\"Masons Swell Temple Fund By $154,699.\\" Washington Post. February 23, 1947. At the GWMNMA's annual meeting in February 1947, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge Replica Room was dedicated. The association also voted to allot one of the rooms in the unfinished tower to the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm (also known as \\"the Grotto\\"), which had raised $25,000 to finish the room. The Supreme Council, Scottish Rite (Southern Jurisdiction, USA) donated $100,000 to finish the north lodge room on the second floor and dedicate it to Cryptic Masonry. Prior to this donation, the association was unsure whether appendant bodies of Freemasonry should be allowed to occupy rooms in the memorial. The Southern Jurisdiction's donation effectively ended this debate. It also encouraged many Grand Lodges (state organizations) of Masonry to make large donations to the memorial, bringing new life to the memorial's fund-raising efforts. The association also agreed to expend funds to build a kitchen and dining room, hang bronze doors on the first floor and install bronze grillwork for the heating and ventilation system on the first floor.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 69. Two other major decisions were made in 1947 as well. Long-time memorial architect Harvey W. Corbett presented his plans for completing the memorial's interior and sculptor Bryant Baker discussed his plans for a life-size statue of George Washington to adorn the memorial hall. The Order of DeMolay, the young men's affiliate of Freemasonry, had won the association's approval for a campaign to raise money for a bronze statue of George Washington back in 1934. Baker proposed a marble statue that would cost $50,000 to $60,000 and stand on a pedestal worth $7,000 to $10,000. The association also began work on its first elevator. The Otis Elevator Company was awarded this contract on October 23, 1947. Designed to fit into the southeast stairwell, the company overcame the 7.5 degree incline of the stairwell by putting wheels on one side of the elevator car to keep it vertical. The memorial's dining room was completed at the end of 1947, and its first use was for a meeting of the GWMNMA in February 1948.\\"Many Here to Honor Washington Today.\\" Washington Post. February 22, 1948. The Grotto dedicated its finished room (designed to house its archives) on the third floor of the building in February 1948.Turnbull and Denslow, p. 287.Hollinger, John R. \\"Grotto Room Dedicated in the George Washington Memorial.\\" The New Age Magazine. April 1948, p. 252. The association, meanwhile, outfitted the first floor auditorium with handrails and bronze windowsills and HVAC ventilation grills. The association also made the decision to begin fund-raising for a number of other projects at the memorial. These included designing, manufacturing and installing stained glass windows in the second floor memorial hall, designing and painting murals on the walls of the memorial hall, finishing the roof over the auditorium and portico, installing marble over the rough cement in the interior stairwells and replacing the large wooden doors at the memorial's entrance with bronze doors.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 70. That same year, President Harry S. TrumanTruman had served as Grand Master of Masons of Missouri from 1940 to 1942, and was a 33¬∞ Sovereign Grand Inspector General and honorary member of the supreme council of the Scottish Rite's Southern Jurisdiction in 1945. The Masonic Presidents Tour - Harry Truman - Thirty- third President presented the memorial with a replica of the Great Seal of the United States which was in diameter and lit from within.Ellis, Paul E. \\"From The President.\\" The Light. Winter 2001, p. 1. The sign had originally topped of the United States Government Printing Office headquarters, but had been damaged by lightning. Removed and listed as scrap, a Freemason noticed the sign in a government warehouse and asked that it to be donated to the memorial. A presentation ceremony was set for June 24, 1948. Truman's arrival at the presentation was significantly delayed, for he had spent the morning giving military orders to begin the Berlin airlift. By September 1949, the memorial was still \\"nowhere near finished.\\"Lyons, Richard L. \\"Alexandria Temple Boasts Only Slanting Elevators.\\" Washington Post. September 23, 1949. None of the tower rooms in floors three through nine were finished, although the observation deck was under construction. The Scottish Rite agreed to fund the observation deck. The observation deck was accessible only by a circular stairway. In late 1949, the Cryptic Lodge Room (also known as the \\"North Room\\") was finished\\"Alexandria Temple Unit Dedicated.\\" Washington Post. December 4, 1949. and the two elevators were installed on the north and south side of the building. The room contained seating for 450 and an organ (which was used for the first time during the room's dedication ceremony).According to Freemason historian William Adrian Brown, the cost of finishing and equipping the Cryptic Lodge Room was $31,500, and another $17,880 raised to provide for its maintenance. The lodges which had provided funds to complete the room were Andrew Jackson Lodge No. 120; Washington Lodge of Perfection, Scottish Rite; Mt. Vernon Chapter No. 14, Royal Arch Masons; Old Dominion Commander No. 11, Knights Templar; and Martha Washington Chapter No. 42, Order of the Eastern Star. See: Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 73. To avoid piercing the second floor's memorial hall, the elevators slanted inward at 7.5 degrees. They were apart on the first floor, but only apart at the observation deck. They were the only slanting elevators in the world when installed, and the motors for them had to be passed up through the shafts in order to get them to the roof.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 72. Other decorative changes were made by late 1949 as well. A woven Persian carpet, the largest in the world and worth $1 million, was donated to the memorial by Sarkis Nahigian (a Masonic member from Chicago). (It was installed in the Alexandria-Washington Replica Lodge Room. But it had to be folded in order to fit in the room, which caused wear on the rug. The rug was removed after several years and reinstalled in the memorial hall on the second floor.) In the Memorial Hall, two stained glass windows designed and manufactured by Robert M. Metcalf were being installed. Bronze doors, grillwork and window sashes had been installed throughout the first floor, the first floor assembly hall was completed, the kitchen and dining room were finished, the north and south corridors on the first floor were completed and an addition to the heating plant installed.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 72-73. The \\"Hall of Presidents\\" was also finished. This walkway on the upper level of the auditorium contained plaques depicting Presidents of the United States who were Masons.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 73-74. The Shriners, too, completed their rooms on the first floor.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 73. At some point during 1949, Bryan Baker's sculpture of George Washington was changed from marble to bronze. The statue and its base were both paid for that year. =1950s= President Truman wearing his Masonic regalia, with other dignitaries at the Masonic National Memorial, February 22, 1950 One of the murals in the Memorial Hall, painted by Allyn Cox in the 1950s. Baker's bronze statue of Washington was finally unveiled on February 22, 1950.Folliard, Edward T. \\"Talk at Dedication of Washington Statue Regarded as Defense of Russian Policy.\\" Washington Post. February 23, 1950. President Truman, past Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Missouri, dedicated the statue and delivered a major foreign policy address at its unveiling. The same year, muralist painter Allyn Cox was hired to paint murals throughout the memorial depicting allegorical Masonic events from history as well as scenes from the life of George Washington.Turnbull and Denslow, p. 288.Smith, J.Y. \\"Allyn Cox Dies; Works Included Capitol Murals.\\" Washington Post. September 28, 1982. The Grand Lodge of California donated the funds for these murals. Cox also designed six stained glass windows for installation above the murals, each depicting a famous Masonic patriot (such as Benjamin Franklin and Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette).Boudreau, Bleimann, and Deutsch, p. 200. The windows were executed and installed by stained glass artist Robert Metcalf. In 1951, the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons agreed to fund the completion of the room on the fifth floor and dedicate it to Holy Royal Arch Masonry. That same year, two more Metcalf windows were installed in the memorial hall, the chimes were installed on the 10th floor, and a ladder (acting as a staircase) was placed to provide access to the 10th floor from the ninth floor. A water tank was installed on the fifth floor (to help ensure high pressure) and plumbing extended to the eighth floor, and air conditioning placed in the second floor South Lodge Room. A spiral staircase was added between the third and ninth floors to provide an emergency exit.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 78. It was also in 1951 that the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania sponsored the completion of the memorial's sixth-floor main library. Outside the memorial, the northwest parking lot was paved and two flagpoles placed outside the main entrance. Work on the memorial continued in 1952, although most of the work was not finished until a year later. The ninth floor observation deck remained unfinished (although money had been donated to enclose it in a suicide-proof iron cage), and only two floors were open to the public. But the sixth floor library was dedicated on February 22, and later that year Allyn Cox's sketches for the memorial hall murals were approved.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 80-81. Finally, with the second-floor auditorium nearing completion, the memorial association authorized the expenditure of funds for the Moller Organ Co. to begin design and construction of a pipe organ for this space. By early 1953, however, the observation deck was finished and opened for use, and the second inclined elevator began to be installed.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 81. Problems with the shaft, however, delayed its completion.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 82. Additional internal construction was also completed at this time. The building plans had called for two sets of stairs to descend from the second floor's memorial hall to the first floor's assembly hall. These stairs had never been completed, however, and the space had been used for storage for years. Now funds were available to build the staircases. In order to do so, the unfinished space beneath the main portico was turned into a storage room, and the stairs were installed. Contractors also resealed the exterior of the tower and the second floor roof parapet to prevent water from leaking into the memorial. By the end of 1953, the remaining stained glass windows in the memorial hall were installed. In 1954, the 42-rank Moller organ was installed in the main auditorium.Hume, Paul. \\"New Organ to Have First Test Tonight.\\" Washington Post. March 1, 1954. The $50,000 for the organ had been donated by the Grand Lodge of New Jersey in 1930. The marble staircases between the first and second floors were also completed,Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 84. and the fifth floor with its Royal Arch Masonry room was almost finished as well.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 85. The memorial association now began reconsidering some of its plans. It was clear now that there was no need for a \\"States Remembrance Room\\" on the fourth floor, and that the eighth floor did not have enough space to hold all the Washingtoniana in the possession of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. So the association resolved to make the fourth floor a Washington museum, while leaving the eighth floor open. Allyn Cox's mural on the south wall of the memorial hall was completed in early 1955. Although a mural on the ceiling of the memorial hall had also long been planned, the association decided to forgo this.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 84‚Äì87. In February 1955, Theodor Vogel, Grand Master of the United Grand Lodges of Germany, presented the memorial association with intricate wood carvings depicting the Four Crowned Martyrs (in this case, Claudius, Castorius, Nicostratus, and Symphorian). The carvings were hung in the memorial library.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 87-88. That same year, the Knights Templar asked that their assigned room be moved from the seventh to the eighth floor. This request was quickly granted, although it left the seventh floor unoccupied. Throughout the year, Allyn Cox continued to work on murals in the Royal Arch Masonry room and on the mural on the north wall of the memorial hall. At the end of the year, the north and south steps from the parking lots to the first floor were completed. William and Annetta Childs of Oklahoma donated an electronic, automated carillon to the memorial, which was installed in the tenth floor.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 88. The following year, the north side elevator was finally completed. With the elevators freed from the need to carry construction materials and workmen, the tower was finally opened to the public.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 88‚Äì89. A number of exterior projects remained, however: granite facing for the upper terrace walls, bronze trim for the main doors, bronze lighting standards for the portico, granite facing for the lower terrace walls, and granite facing for the back of the auditorium. Some interior work was also needed. For example, holes had been drilled in the marble floor of the memorial hall so that electric plugs could be installed for lighting fixtures.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 89. The unassigned seventh floor finally found a sponsor as well. That year, the Grand Central Council of Cryptic Masonry agreed to sponsor the floor, and by year's end had raised half the funds necessary to complete and furnish the floor. The Royal Arch Room was dedicated on April 20, 1957, by Vice President of the United States Richard Nixon.\\"New Chapel Dedicated By Masons.\\" Washington Post. April 21, 1957. The four bays in the room remained unfinished for many years, however, and were curtained off.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 89-90. The same year, the Southern and Northern Jurisdictions of the Scottish Rite dedicated the George Washington museum on the memorial's fourth floorRiddell, John P. \\"The George Washington Museum Displays Rich Relics.\\" The Light. Spring 1999, p. 4. (although there were no display cases or other furnishings to permit the Washington museum to open). The day before Easter (April 20), the Knights Templar dedicated their eighth floor chapel. At year's end, the second of Allyn Cox's murals for the memorial hall was completed.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 90. Work on the seventh-floor Cryptic Masonry room was well under way by late 1957 and the room was dedicated on February 12, 1958.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 94. A change was made to the portico as well that year. The portico had been designed so that large bronze plaques could be installed on either side of the main doors. Fundraising for these plaques had not gone well, leaving two gaping holes in the marble walls. The memorial association decided that marble, rather than bronze, plaques be installed in these spaces. Quotations from George Washington's Masonic correspondence were selected and inscribed on these marble plaques. Additionally, the bronze doors for both sets of elevators were also installed (at a cost of $18,000).Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 92. At the end of the year, the memorial association spent more than $108,000 to finish the granite facing of the auditorium. In 1959, a large bronze bust of Washington by sculptor Donald De Lue (commissioned by the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, and originally destined for their headquarters) was donated to the museum. The Scottish Rite offered to finance the completion of the fourth floor's museum. =1960s and 1970s= In 1962, artists Dwight Franklin and Robert N.S. Whitelaw completed 12 dioramas (worth $75,000) to be placed in the assembly hall and which depicted key incidents in Washington's life.Douglas, Walter B. \\"Dioramas Tell Story of Washington's Life.\\" Washington Post. February 16, 1962. These dioramas had been part of the original decorative scheme for the memorial, with eight dioramas (two for each corner) to be placed in the assembly hall. Due to a dispute over the subject matter, 12 rather than eight dioramas were ordered.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 93. Air conditioning was added to the North Lodge (form the Cryptic Lodge) Room in 1963.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 95. But despite these achievements, by 1964 the memorial still wasn't finished. More than 150,000 people a year were visiting the memorial, but the Washington museum was still unfinished.Douglas, Walter B. \\"'Lighthouse' of Alexandria Looms As One of Area's Several Wonders.\\" Washington Post. August 30, 1964. A major push to finish the museum came after 1966, when Washington's descendants‚ÄîAnne Madison and Patty Willis Washington‚Äîdonated the Washington family's collection of papers and memorabilia to the museum. The donation included a large portrait of George Washington and his family, as well as the Washington family Bible.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 96. Only after this donation was made were funds for the museum's completion finally raised.\\"Former Curator Returns to The Memorial.\\" The Light. Fall 2000, p. 1. The late 1960s saw the completion of the memorial. In February 1966, Senator Everett Dirksen (a Mason) dedicated the George Washington museum on the memorial's fourth floor.\\"Washington Birthday Rites Set.\\" Washington Post. February 21, 1966. The dedication meant that the final room in the tower was now complete and open to the public. In 1967, the city of Alexandria changed the street layout around the memorial. As part of this alteration, the memorial granted the city a wide access path (or \\"alley\\") between the memorial's access road and Park Road. Since the back wall of the auditorium had never been faced with granite, the protruding steel reinforcing bars had rusted. These were removed in 1968, as they were no longer fit for use. Finally, in 1970, the 40-year-old oil-burning heating plant was replaced with new natural gas-burning boilers, the city of Alexandria donated a back-up electrical generator to keep the tower lit in case of blackouts, additional lighting for the tower was installed, and additional landscaping work completed.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 97. The memorial was considered complete in 1970.\\"On the Cover.\\" The Athelstanian. August 2010, p. 2. However, the granite facing still remained incomplete. The memorial association finally raised the funds to finish the facing in July 1972, and the facing was finished in March 1973.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 99. The tower, too, remained only partially lit. But the Grand Lodge of New York provided the funds to finish the lighting, and the final tower exterior illumination was completed in the summer of 1973.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 99-100. About the building The memorial at sunset on July 30, 2011. The George Washington Masonic National Memorial is Neoclassical in style. Portions of the building are also in the Greek Revival and Romanesque Revival styles. The columns which form the portico, are in the first floor assembly hall and the second floor main hall, and on the first tier of the tower are Doric. However, the columns on the second tier of the tower are Ionic, and the columns on the third tier of the tower are Corinthian. The memorial consists of nine floors. The first (or \\"ground\\") floor appears, from the outside, to be part of the foundation. In the center of the first floor is the Grand Masonic Hall. The Grand Masonic Hall features eight large green granite columns, four on each side of the hall. The Grand Masonic Hall is long, wide, and high. The 12 dioramas commissioned in the mid-1960s are located in this hall. At the western end of the hall are short steps which lead up to an alcove in which a bronze bust of George Washington was placed in 2008.Tabbert, Mark A. \\"New Exhibit Opens During World Conference.\\" The Messenger. Summer 2008, p. 2. The semicircular alcove surrounding the bust contains murals depicting Masonic events in the life of Washington. For many years, the Great Seal of the United States donated by President Truman to the memorial in 1948 was displayed in this hall, but it was removed in the late 1990s. Large, medium, and small meeting rooms are on the north and south sides of the Grand Masonic Hall. All three rooms on the north side contain exhibits which document the history and activities of the Shriners. Many of the models in these rooms depict Shriner charities, and one model is a miniature mechanical version of a Shriners' parade. The medium-sized room on the memorial's southwest corner contains an exhibit about Freemasonry in general. The medium-sized meeting room (the George Washington Room) and large-sized meeting room (the Andrew Jackson Room) on the south side are generally closed to the public but can be rented as meeting space. A portion of one of the murals in the Cryptic Masonry room on the seventh floor. The second (or \\"main\\") floor appears, from the outside, to be the main level of the memorial. The Parthenon-inspired portico with its Doric columns forms the primary entrance to the memorial. The portico is supported by eight fluted columns of pink Conway granite in diameter and high, each weighing .Riddell, J.P. \\"Memorial Hall.\\" The Light. Spring 2000, p. 5. The bas-relief medallion of Washington in profile which is incorporated into the pediment above the portico is across. Bronze doors lead the way into the memorial. Once inside the memorial, to the left is the Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 Replica Lodge Room, which faithfully duplicates the look of the lodge room at the time Washington presided over the lodge. This room contains several items which belonged to Washington as well as historic items (such as furniture) from the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. Behind the Master Mason's chair in this room is the William Joseph Williams portrait of Washington in his Masonic garb. Along the south side of this floor is the South Lodge Room, which replicates the Neoclassical look of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge when it was located in the Alexandria City Courthouse. This room is used for meetings of Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 as well as other Masonic lodges who wish to use it for meetings while visiting the memorial. The main feature of the second floor is the Memorial Hall, which is long, wide, and high. Eight green granite columns (four on each side) support the roof of the Memorial Hall.\\"More History Than Mystery in Alexandria.\\" Washington Post. January 29, 2010. Each column is high, wide at the base, and weighs . On the western end of the hall is the high bronze statue of Washington in Masonic regalia. It weighs . The floor is composed of Tennessee marble in a geometric design, and the walls are of Missouri marble. In the corners of the Memorial Hall are four high bronze lamps, donated by the Order of the Eastern Star (a Masonic social organization composed primarily of women). On the north and south sides of the Memorial Hall are murals by Allyn Cox depicting Washington attending a service at Christ Church, Alexandria and of Washington (in Masonic garb) laying the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol building. The murals were photographed in their entirety for the first time in 2000.\\"Murals in Memorial Hall Photographed for the First Time.\\" The Light. Spring 2000, p. 6. Behind the Memorial Hall to the west is the semicircular Memorial Theater, which was designed to seat 1,000. (After being reconfigured, it seats just 358 today.) The Memorial Theater features a fan-shaped ceiling and 16 St. Genevieve marble columns around its perimeter. Around the mezzanine are 14 bronze bas-relief portraits of Presidents of the United States who were Freemasons.\\"Gerald R. Ford, 33Àö ‚Äî President, Statesman, Freemason.\\" The Messenger. Spring 2007, p. 6. Behind the stage is the portrait of Washington donated by Rep. Sol Bloom. In the balcony in the theater's eastern end is the Moller organ donated by Grand Lodge of New Jersey. On the north side on the first floor is the North Lodge Room. An open-beam arched ceiling marks this room, which is in the half- timbered style and has balconies on three sides and a stage in front.\\"The North Lodge Room.\\" The Light. Fall 1999, p. 6. This is the meeting room of Andrew Jackson Lodge No. 120, as well as other Masonic lodges who wish to use it for meetings while visiting the memorial. The altar in the chapel in the Knights Templar room on the memorial's eighth floor. The tower contains the third through ninth floors. The tower is divided into four sections, each smaller in circumference than the one below. There are two floors in the first, second, and third section, but only one floor in the fourth section. The third floor contains exhibits about the history, charitable activities, and socializing that various Masonic bodies engage in. The third floor used to be solely dedicated to the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm (\\"the Grotto\\"), and housed the organization's archives. But beginning in February 2012, the third floor was renovated to contain displays about other appendant bodies as well (although the Grotto's display in the room remains by far the largest).\\"Family of Freemasonry Exhibit.\\" Light. Summer 2011, p. 12. The fourth floor contains the George Washington Museum, which is maintained with funding from the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite of the Southern and Northern Jurisdictions of the United States. The Donald De Lue bronze statue of Washington is located in the museum,Howlett and Noble, p. 132. which also contains many items used or owned by Washington. The fourth floor is double the height of the third floor, with a mezzanine that contains additional exhibits. The fifth floor is the same height as the third floor, and is dedicated to exhibits and symbols important to Royal Arch Masonry. This floor is in the Egyptian Revival and ancient Hebraic architectural styles. It also contains a replica of the ark of the covenant (curtains automatically open and close to reveal the replica to visitors). The sixth floor contains the Memorial Library.Burian, p. 408. This floor is double the height of the fifth floor, and like the fourth floor contains a mezzanine. The seventh floor is the same height as the third and fifth floors, and is dedicated to Cryptic Masonry (the second part of the York Rite system of Masonic degrees). The room is a symbolic replica of the legendary crypt beneath the Temple of Solomon where secrets and treasures were kept. It also contains murals which depict key events mentioned in Cryptic initiation rituals (such as the murder of Hiram Abiff, architect of Solomon's Temple). The eighth floor is the same height as the seventh floor, and contains a chapel dedicated to the Knights Templar. It is in the early French Gothic architectural style. Like the fourth and sixth floors, it is double the height of the third and fifth floors but it lacks the mezzanine found on the fourth and sixth floors. The stained glass windows in this chapel depict four scenes from the Christian Bible: Jesus healing the blind, the Sermon on the Mount, the crucifixion of Jesus, and the ascension of Jesus into heaven. The ninth floor is the same height as the third, fifth, and seventh floors, and contains both the Tall Cedars Room and the observation platform. The Tall Cedars of Lebanon is a social group for Master Masons, and their room on the ninth floor depicts King Solomon's throne room and symbols important to this group. The observation platform, which rings the exterior of the ninth floor, is accessible only from this room. The structure is capped by a step pyramid with seven steps.Seghers, George A. \\"Message From Alexandria.\\" The Messenger. Summer 2008, p. 3. The light fixture atop the pyramid is in the shape of a double keystone (a shape which is of symbolic importance to Freemasons). The memorial sits on of parkland. Since the GWMNMA is a nonprofit organization, the memorial and its land are not taxed. The first and second floors are open to all visitors, but visitors are required to be accompanied by a docent when visiting the other floors. Tours occur every hour. Tours were free for most of the memorial's history, but a fee began to be charged in 2010. Building operations The Square and Compasses, a large Masonic symbol built of concrete, was added to the memorial in 1999. =Finances and organizational changes= The George Washington Masonic National Memorial is the only Masonic building supported by all 52 grand lodges of the United States.Bahr, et al., p. 59. By 1983, the memorial had 35 full-time staff and an annual budget of $500,000.Burgess, John. \\"The 'Secret' That Everyone Is Able to See.\\" Washington Post. April 24, 1983. At that time, each person initiated into Freemasonry in the United States paid a one-time-only $5 fee which was deposited in the memorial's building maintenance fund. But despite this income and its endowment, the memorial faced a severe financial crisis in the 1980s.\\"From The President.\\" The Light. Fall 2000, p. 1. A significant decline in the number of Freemasons in the United States led to strong declines in donations to the memorial's maintenance and endowment funds. The building needed significant repairs, but making them left the maintenance fund exhausted. For the first time in its history, the GWMNMA considered taking out a loan to pay for the repairs and the upkeep of the memorial. The financial crisis was avoided when several Grand Lodges adopted a per capita assessment on their members to keep the memorial afloat, and the GWMNMA began a series of fundraisers and the sale of gifts to generate additional income. In 1993, to make the memorial a more central part of the cultural life of Alexandria, the memorial began renting out its meeting rooms, assembly halls, and theaters to private groups for various kinds of functions. In 1994, the memorial's operating budget was $600,000. By 2000, the GWMNMA's endowment had grown to $12 million.\\"Paul E. Ellis Elected President.\\" The Light. Spring 2000, p. 1. But revenues were still inadequate. In the 1920s and 1930s, many Grand Lodges had enacted a per capita assessment on their members to provide general support for the GWMNMA. But by 2003, only one-quarter of all Grand Lodges still did so. That year, the GWMNMA began pushing Grand Lodges to assess an automatic per capita contribution again. The program met with some success. But despite this growth, in 2004 the endowment was still only half the size it needed to be.Seghers, George D. \\"Message From Alexandria.\\" The Messenger. Winter 2004, p. 3. The GWMNMA also made some organizational changes. Between 1910 and 1951, the association had had just three presidents (Shyrock, Watres, and Arn). The GWMNMA board of directors decided that imposing term limits on the office of the president would give board members a chance to become president and implement new ideas more frequently. In 2004, the GWMNMA amended its constitution to impose a limit of three one-year terms on presidents of the association.Lichty, Warren D. \\"Greetings From The President.\\" The Messenger. Winter 2004, p. 2. In 2008, the number of presidential terms limit was reduced further to two one-year terms.\\"2008 Annual Meeting.\\" The Messenger. Spring 2008, p. 1. For the calendar year 2008,These are the most recent figures available as of March 31, 2011. the GWMNMA had 21 staff, total revenues of just over $1 million, total expenses of about $1.6 million, and total assets of about $15.8 million.\\"Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax. Form 990.\\" George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association. 54-0545202. December 31, 2008. The association's endowment, however, was not as robust as it had once been. About $500,000 had been spent (primarily on building repairs), and losses due to the economic downturn were significant (close to $2.7 million). The endowment had dropped from about $11.8 million at the end of 2007 to about $8.7 million at the end of 2008. =Renovations= Major changes have occurred to the memorial and the nearby area since it was completed in 1970. The King Street Metro station opened about three blocks from the memorial in November 1983.Martinez, Michael. \\"King St. Station Bringing New Life to Old Town.\\" Washington Post. November 21, 1983. Storm windows on the exterior of building were also replaced about this time, at a cost of $75,000. Microwave transmission antennas were added to the top of the memorial in 1990 to help the City of Alexandria improve police radio transmissions in the area.Jenkins, Jr., Kent. \\"Alexandria to Improve Police Radio; City to Set Dishes Atop GW Memorial.\\" Washington Post. April 12, 1990. For the memorial's 60th anniversary in 1992, the George Washington museum exhibited a special collection of Washingtoniana. A rhinestone Past Master's Masonic \\"jewel,\\" owned by Martha Washington and sold by the Washington family at the time of her death, was part of the display. Also loaned to the museum was the desk in the Maryland Statehouse on which Washington resigned his commission in the Continental Army at the end of the American Revolution. The Washington museum's collection was recataloged at this time as well. This led to some historic discoveries. It had long been known that the Washington family Bible had a half-page of the family torn out, but the recataloging discovered that one of Washington's descendants had ripped it out to go into the cornerstone of the Washington Monument on July 4, 1848. A map, hand-drawn by Washington to show the route a British military expedition took to Ohio in 1790, turned up in a desk. Also uncovered was a book on the use of artillery sent to Washington by a Scotsman, and a 1798 encyclopedia (the first printed in America) specially ordered by Washington. Researchers also uncovered a print of Washington's deathbed scene, and the stub of a candle carried by Freemasons in a ceremony after his death. In 1999, the George Washington Masonic National Memorial was branded for the first time as a Masonic building. Although twin sidewalks used to run directly up the eastern slope of Shooter's Hill toward the memorial's front steps, these were partially replaced by curving cement paths and a large Square and Compasses (the Masonic symbol) in a landscaped setting.O'Hanlon, Ann. \\"A Symbolic Addition: The Letter 'G' Is Concrete, but Its Meaning Is Abstract.\\" Washington Post. July 29, 1999. The new symbol cost $250,000,\\"A Day in History.\\" The Light. Winter 1999, p. 1. and is wide by long. (It is visible from aircraft landing at nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.) A number of renovations and repairs were made to the memorial in 1999 and 2000 as well. The Tall Cedars of Lebanon paid for the cleaning and restoration of its room on the ninth floor about this time.\\"Knights Templar, Grotto and Tall Cedars Renovating Areas.\\" The Light. Spring 1999, p. 8. The ninth floor chapel suffered water damage in the early and mid-1990s, but the Knights Templar organization repaired and repainted this space in 1999. At the same time, the Grotto began a project to refurbish the murals and decorations in its room, while also researching and preparing for a later installation of new exhibits and displays. In the fall of 1999, the York Rite organization installed an exhibit in the south hall on the memorial's first floor which explained the rite's charities, degrees, and goals.\\"York Rite Sovereign College Installs Exhibit.\\" The Light. Fall 1999, p. 2. Scheduled for completion in 2000 were a lawn sprinkler system on the east side of the hill, refurbishment of the boilers and the kitchen, installation of air conditioning in the Memorial Theater and library, upgrades to the elevators, repairs and upgrades to the electrical system, upgrades to make the memorial more ADA-compliant, removal hazardous materials (such as asbestos), repaving of driveways and parking lots, waterproofing of the portico and the tower, and a general refurbishment of the interior.\\"Projects in Progress ‚Äì 2000.\\" The Light. Spring 2000, p. 3. \\"Edgar N. Peppler Retiring As President.\\" The Light. Winter 2000, p. 2. The cost of these upgrades was in excess of $500,000.\\"Projects in Progress.\\" The Light. Summer 2000, p. 5. Seghers, George D. \\"A Message from the Executive Secretary-Treasurer.\\" The Light. Fall 2000, p. 4. The same year, the memorial hired staff to begin a major renovation of the George Washington Museum and its exhibits, and began a major landscaping effort to restore the grounds to their original condition. But despite these repairs, by 2002 the memorial still had almost $795,000 in deferred repairs.Seghers, George D. \\"From the Secretary.\\" The Light. Summer 2002, p. 3. Some of the larger and more costly projects which were needed included removal and resetting of the granite front steps, purchase and installation of emergency generators, replacement of the fresh water mains, installation of a tuned mass damper to prevent wind damage to the tower, installation of emergency lighting, and a structural survey of the memorial.\\"Projects That Need Funding ‚Äì 2002.\\" The Light. Winter 2002, p. 6. In 2003, the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions of Scottish Rite of Freemasonry agreed to provide $200,000 to fund the renovation of the George Washington museum.Lichty, Warren D. \\"From the President.\\" The Light. Summer 2003, p. 4. The renovations were to be completed by August 2003. In February 2004, renovations to the exhibits in the three Shriners' rooms on the first floor were also complete.\\"Memorial Welcomes 2004 Conference and Holds Successful Annual Meeting.\\" The Messenger. Spring 2004, p. 1. By fall of that year, the sidewalks on the north side of the memorial had also been replaced,\\"Wish List ‚Äì 2004.\\" The Messenger. Fall 2004, p. 3. and in 2005 retaining walls around the Masonic symbol on the east side were built.\\"Wish List ‚Äì 2005.\\" The Messenger. Spring 2005, p. 3. Aircraft warning lights were installed atop the memorial in early 2006, and security lighting installed in the parking lots.\\"Wish List ‚Äì 2006.\\" The Messenger. Spring 2006, p. 3. But while welcome, these were not the major repairs the GWMNMA said it needed to make. In anticipation of the association's 100th anniversary in 2010, the memorial underwent significant repair. The GNWMMA Board of Directors approved a significant expenditure of funds to make these changes. The Main Assembly Hall was renamed the Grand Masonic Hall,\\"Board Approves Major Projects at Semi-Annual Board Meeting.\\" The Messenger. Summer 2007, p. 1. and restored to its original condition.Seghers, George D. \\"Message From Alexandria.\\" The Messenger. Spring 2007, p. 3. The \\"Grand Masonic Hall\\" was also enclosed with glass and doors, permitting it to be used as a conference center. Air conditioning was installed throughout the building, elevators reaching to the first floor added, the roof over the second and third floors repaired, the memorial made even more handicap-accessible, the main front granite steps removed and reset, and a security and surveillance system installed.\\"Message From Alexandria.\\" The Messenger. Summer 2007, p. 3. The hallways around the Grand Masonic Hall on the first floor were repainted, new lighting installed, and a new photo exhibit (\\"The Golden Age of Masonic Architecture\\") placed on the walls.Tabbert, Mark A. \\"New Exhibit Opens.\\" The Messenger. Summer 2007, p. 7. The room containing the historic replica of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 meeting room was also renovated and updated, to better display the Washingtoniana in the room.Brumback, Michael D. \\"Greetings From The President.\\" The Messenger. Fall 2008, p. 1-2. A new exhibit, \\"The Form and Function of American Freemasonry,\\" was added to the first floor to help explain what Freemasonry is and what its symbols represent. Also planned were an exhibit (intended for the Grotto's third floor room) about Freemasonry's appendant bodies and a history of the memorial and its relationship with the city of Alexandria.Seghers, Georg D. \\"Message From Alexandria.\\" The Messenger. Spring 2008, p. 2. Several new exhibits and permanent displays were added to the memorial in 2010 as well. On February 22, 2010, the GWMNMA unveiled a new painting by artist Christopher Erney depicting George Washington as a Freemason.\\"Centennial Celebration.\\" The Messenger. Fall 2010, p. 1. The memorial also unveiled a new temporary exhibit, \\"The Freemasons' White House Stones.\\" The exhibit displayed stones which had been marked with Masonic symbols by some of the Scottish workmen during the construction of the White House in the 1790s.Wasserman, p. 59. Although some stones were permanently cemented into place in the fireplace in the White House basement kitchen, others had been unearthed during the structure's renovation from 1949‚Äì1951. President Truman sent each Grand Lodge and Masonic body in the U.S. one of these stones.\\"Centennial Celebration.\\" The Messenger. Fall 2009, p. 5. The new exhibit reassembled most of these stones again in one location for the first time since 1951.Tabbert, Mark A. \\"Memorial Opens White House Stones Exhibit.\\" Light. Spring 2010, p. 2, 4. A new, permanent exhibit was \\"Founders' Hall,\\" which featured busts of Charles H. Callahan, Thomas J. Shryock, Louis H. Watres, and Elmer R. Arn.\\"Honoring Our Founders.\\" Light. Summer 2010, p. 1-2. The GWMNMA also received $50,000 from the California Grand Lodge to plant trees throughout the grounds.\\"California Tree Project.\\" Light. Summer 2010, p. 6. =New programs= The GWMNMA has voiced concern that the memorial seems isolated from the life of the city around it, and the association has worked to improve its relationship with the surrounding community. For example, in February 1994, the memorial held its first \\"open house.\\"Hong, Peter. \\"Inside Look at a Landmark.\\" Washington Post. February 24, 1994. The memorial was opened to the public for the first time without the need for a guide, and numerous objects and documents related to Washington from Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22's private collection were put on display. The memorial also opened its grounds to archeological digs in 1994. Estimates of human occupation on Shooter's Hill go back as far as 3,000 BC.Allen, Mike. \\"City's Hill Holds 5,000 Years of History.\\" Washington Post. May 22, 1997. Shooter's Hill had been occupied by Native Americans, a mansion (in the 1830s and 1840s), a log cabin, Fort Ellsworth, a reservoir for the city's fresh water system, a park for outdoor dancing, and the Alexandria Golf Course among many others.Constable, Pamela. \\"Young Alexandrians Help Unearth City's Past.\\" Washington Post. June 25, 1995. Alexandria city archeologists used ground-penetrating radar to help identify sites of interest on Shooter's Hill, including a brick foundation wall.Sigal, Ann Cameron. \\"Uncovering History.\\" Washington Post. May 15, 2009. In the dig's first three seasons, a stone ax, pieces of ceramic pots, Civil War ammunition, various kinds of colored glass, a piece of jewelry shaped like a scarab, a Colonial-era mug imported from England, Native American spear points, a silver-plated spoon, a stoneware jar, and the bisque heads of dolls manufactured in Germany were found. In 2002, the memorial opened an exhibit designed to showcase some of the archeological evidence unearthed on the memorial grounds.\\"Archaeology Exhibit Unveiled.\\" The Light. Summer 2002, p. 5. =Crime at the memorial= The memorial has been the target of criminal activity several times in its history. The first set of incidents occurred in the 1960s. Twice the Cox murals in the second floor Memorial Hall were vandalized. The first time was about 1960, when someone cut into one of the murals and removed a fist-sized portion of the canvas.Douglas, Walter B. \\"Washington Mural Cut By Vandal in Alexandria.\\" Washington Post. March 25, 1965. The second time was in March 1965, when two portions of a mural were cut out. The vandals were not caught, but the murals were repaired. The memorial's grounds have also been vandalized numerous times. In the 1960s and throughout the 1970s, vandals uprooted trees, sawed the tops off the memorial's many evergreens (for use as Christmas trees), smashed windows with stones, held drag races on the lawns, and cut fences down for use as firewood. At one point in 1973, the vandalism was so severe that security guards with attack dogs had to patrol the grounds at night.Brown, History of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial..., p. 97-98. The memorial has also drawn unwanted attention from potential terrorists. In April 2005, Syed Haris Ahmed, a naturalized American citizen and student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, took videos of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial as well as the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the headquarters of the World Bank, and other buildings and infrastructure in the D.C. area.Johnson, Carrie. \\"Ga. Man Convicted of Terrorist Support.\\" Washington Post. June 11, 2009. American law enforcement authorities later learned that Ahmed had shared the video with Younes Tsouli and Aabid Hussein Khan (men later convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United Kingdom). Ahmed was arrested in March 2006, and convicted in 2009. In media and popular culture A scene from the 2007 mystery-adventure film National Treasure: Book of Secrets was filmed in the Memorial Theater.Deane, Daniela and Downey, Kirstin. \\"Freemasonry, Eager to Step From Cultural Shadows.\\" Washington Post. December 24, 2007. The stage in the theater was a stand-in for a lecture hall. An additional scene was filmed in the Memorial Hall.Brumback, Michael D. \\"Greetings From The President.\\" The Messenger. Fall 2007, p. 1. The memorial also figured briefly in author Dan Brown's 2009 best- selling novel, The Lost Symbol.Hesse, Monica and Montgomery, David. \\"Mysteries All Over the Map.\\" Washington Post. September 10, 2009. The memorial is discussed in chapter 78, but not visited by the novel's protagonists.Burstein and De Keijzer, p. 228. When the book was released in 2009, the memorial attracted widespread media attention. The Discovery Channel filmed a portion of a documentary about Freemasonry at the memorial in August 2009 (it aired in October 2009).Tabbert, Mark A. \\"The Memorial and The Lost Symbol.\\" The Messenger. Fall 2010, p. 7. Brown himself recommended that The Today Show co- host Matt Lauer visit the memorial, and Lauer subsequently filmed a segment in the Royal Arch room (it aired September 14, 2009, the day before Brown's book was released). NBC Nightly News interviewed memorial staff around the same time, and Dateline NBC recorded a portion of a segment on Brown's book at the memorial as well (it aired October 16, 2009). C-SPAN aired a special program about the building, George Washington Masonic National Memorial, on December 21, 2010 (the 100th anniversary of the creation of the memorial's governing association).George Washington Masonic National Memorial.

The line opened to East Hills in 1931 and was extended to connect to the Main South line in 1987. Most services along the line form part of the Airport & South Line operated by Sydney Trains.  Alignment  The East Hills line branches from the Illawarra line at Wolli Creek Junction, between Tempe and Arncliffe railway stations. From Wolli Creek, the line heads west towards East Hills, where the alignment is within 2 km of the since- constructed M5 South Western Motorway. It then turns south-west through the new suburbs of Voyager Point and Wattle Grove to meet the Main South line at Glenfield Junction. The line is four tracks between Wolli Creek junction and Revesby station, then two tracks to Glenfield junction. The bridge over the Georges River at East Hills, opened in 1987, is the only significant engineering structure on the line.  History  Map of the East Hills Line from 1939 showing the limit of electrification at Kingsgrove, and the former station names Dumbleton and Herne Bay. Proposals for a line to East Hills were first raised after World War 1 as an extension of the existing line at Bankstown. In 1923, the Railway Department put forward a proposal for a railway from Tempe to Salt Pan Creek to serve the growing town of Dumbleton (later known as Beverly Hills). Residents west of Salt Pan Creek petitioned the government to extend the line to East Hills. The New South Wales Public Works Committee approved of construction of a railway from Tempe to East Hills in August 1924 and the bill for construction of the line passed both Houses of the state Parliament in late 1924. A ceremony at Padstow Park commemorating the turning of the first sod by the then-Premier of New South Wales Jack Lang was held in September 1927. The initial line was to be double track between Tempe and Kingsgrove and single track beyond, although earthworks were to allow future easy duplication of the entire route. Electrification was also to end at Kingsgrove. Construction began in 1927 with the employment of 400 workers, and most of the earthworks were completed in by 1930.Oakes, J. Salt Pan via Dumbleton. The Story of the East Hills Line. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, September 2001, Vol 52, no 767. Station names were announced in November 1929. They were largely the same as those used today with the exception of Dumbleton (present-day Beverly Hills) and Herne Bay (present-day Riverwood). The first section to Kingsgrove opened on 21 September 1931 as an electrified double track line from Wolli Creek Junction on the Illawarra line to Kingsgrove. The second section, a single-track non- electrified extension to East Hills, was opened on 19 December 1931 by the then-Minister for Local Government James McGirr in a ceremony at East Hills. Points to reverse trains were provided at Kingsgrove, and a passing loop was provided at Herne Bay. Services on this section were by CPH railmotor, supplemented by through steam trains from Central in peak hours.Salt Pan via Dumbleton ‚Äì The Story of the East Hills Line Oakes, John Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, September 2001 pp323-346 Some electric services from Kingsgrove operated through to St James station (the City Circle was not complete at that time), however most terminated at Tempe, connecting with Illawarra line services to and from the city. Complete through service commenced in 1937. The single line between Kingsgrove and East Hills was opened for electric services on 17 December 1939.Mok, Danny \\"FordGhia's Railway & Transport in Australia Page: East Hills Line Information & Photos\\". Retrieved 3 February 2003. The line was duplicated between Kingsgrove and Riverwood in 1948, with points for terminating trains provided at both stations, and a passing loop at Revesby was opened in 1956. Services generally ran all stations from East Hills via Tempe and Sydenham, to the City Circle. Occasional services terminated at Riverwood, Kingsgrove and Padstow. Most trains stopped at Erskineville and St Peters, now only served by the Bankstown line. =A major link for south west Sydney= In 1985, the line was duplicated through to East Hills and on 21 December 1987 extended to Glenfield to connect with the Main South Line, allowing through services to and from Campbelltown. A new station was provided at Holsworthy, and East Hills station was rebuilt with the addition of a third platform. When services commenced on 21 December 1987,Bozier, Rolfe, \\"New South Wales Railways: East Hills Line: History\\". Retrieved 30 December 2006. there were only limited services from Campbelltown via East Hills during peak hours only; however, in 1988 an all day half-hourly service was provided. Local (all stations) services generally ran every 15 minutes from East Hills.\\"NSW Rail Historical Timetables: Pre CityRail\\". Retrieved 30 December 2006. In conjunction with the construction of the Airport Line, the section of the East Hills Line between Wolli Creek Junction and Kingsgrove was quadruplicated. Once this was opened, the running patterns of the trains on the lines changed. The \\"flying junctions\\" interchange near Central Station was altered to give the Airport Line its own platforms (21 & 23) at Central. Local (all stations) trains generally were timetabled to run from East Hills via the airport, peak hour express trains from Campbelltown run along the original route via Sydenham, taking the express tracks between Kingsgrove and Wolli Creek Junction. The line as a whole suffered a substantial loss in patronage when the M5 East Tunnel opened in 2002. The tunnel joined the Eastern Distributor and M5 South Western Motorway, shortening road travel times between the city and the south west. The line was estimated to have lost 384,450 commuters over 12 months after the tunnel opened.Kerr, Joseph, \\"Motorway takes toll on rail trips\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 2 April 2003. Retrieved 30 December 2006. Since that time, however, the line appears to have gained commuters again, with a reported 3.5% increase in patronage up to early 2006.Pearlman, Jonothan, \\"Passengers crowd onto fewer trains\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 3 March 2006. Retrieved 30 December 2006. An additional platform and turn-back track was completed at Revesby as part of the Rail Clearways Program. From October 2009 it replaced East Hills as the primary turn-back point for local all-stations services on the line.Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation, \\"Revesby Turnback: Project Profile\\". Retrieved 30 December 2006. A second Rail Clearways project involved quadruplicating the section of track between Kingsgrove and Revesby. This enables express services between the Campbelltown area and the city to operate separately from local services between Revesby and the city.Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation, \\"Kingsgrove to Revesby Quadruplication: Project Profile\\".

He played in 34 Test matches and took 139 wickets at a bowling average of 24.70. The first Pakistani to pass 100 wickets, he reached the landmark in his 22nd match. Fazal played his earliest first-class cricket for Northern India in the Ranji Trophy and strong performances there led to selection for India's inaugural tour of Australia in 1947‚Äì48. The independence of Pakistan, prior to the tour led Fazal, a Muslim, to withdraw and choose Pakistan. He played a major role in first gaining Test status for the new nation and then establishing them as a Test match team. He took ten wickets in a Test on four occasions; those against India, England and Australia coming in Pakistan's maiden victories over those teams. Fazal's most memorable performance came on the 1954 tour of England, when he had a leading role as Pakistan won at The Oval to square the series. He took match figures of 12/99, including 6/46 in the second innings as England collapsed chasing a target of 168. Succeeding Abdul Kardar as captain, Fazal led the national team in 10 matches between 1959 and 1961. He had immediate success against the West Indies but after losing to Australia and a stalemate with India he was sacked as captain. In all Pakistan won two Tests and lost two under his leadership. He retired from Test and first-class cricket following the 1962 tour of England when he was called up to replace injured opening bowlers. Early life Born in Lahore, Fazal attended Islamia College, Lahore, from the age of 13. His father, Ghulam Hussain, was a Professor of Economics at the College as well as being president of the College's cricket club. Before settling for a career in academia, and despite passing the competitive Indian Civil Service exams, Ghulam Hussain joined the independence movement under the Islamic scholar and revolutionary activist Ubaidullah Sindhi, hoping to throw the British colonialists from a base in Afghanistan through an armed struggle.Peter Oborne, Wounded Tiger: A History of Cricket in Pakistan, Simon and Schuster (2015), pp. 4-5 He set Fazal a stringent training routine which involved waking at 4:30 am, walking five miles and running five miles. This schedule was adhered to for seven years. Fazal made the College first team in his second year and at the age of 15 took 5/13This notation means he took five wickets and conceded 13 runs in an inter-college final, a record for the tournament. First-class cricket =India= In March 1944, Fazal, aged 17 and still at college, made his first-class debut for Northern India. In a Ranji Trophy match against Southern Punjab he batted at number eleven scoring 38 not out and taking three wickets. His maiden first-class wicket was that of India Test all-rounder Lala Amarnath. In Fazal's second appearance, a semi- final against Western India, he claimed eight wickets including 6/65 in the first innings. After a quiet 1944‚Äì45 season, in which Fazal took five wickets at 18.20, his performances the following season almost led to a place on the 1946 tour of England. Playing in the Zonal Quadrangular Tournament, a competition which acted as a trial for the tour, he opened the bowling for North Zone with Amarnath and took match figures of 9/83. Indian captain Nawab of Pataudi wanted Fazal in the squad but he was considered too young by the other selectors. On the tourists return home they played two matches against a Rest of India XI, Fazal took seven wickets in the first match which the Rest won but was expensive in the second. Later in the 1946‚Äì47 season his batting abilities were displayed when he scored his first and only first-class century. Playing for North Zone he scored exactly 100 not out from number eight, sharing in a 207-run seventh wicket partnership with Gogumal Kishenchand. North Zone won the match comfortably with Fazal contributing six wickets. He took a further five wickets in the final but North Zone lost by an innings. The zonal tournament had again acted as a trial, on this occasion for the country's inaugural tour of Australia in 1947‚Äì48. Fazal was included in the squad and attended the training camp, however before the tour began independence intervened and as a devout Muslim Fazal withdrew. =Pakistan= The maiden first-class match in the newly formed country took place on 27 December 1947 between Punjab and Sind. Fazal played for Punjab, taking six wickets and scoring 60 in an innings victory. The match was the first time that Fazal opened the bowling alongside Khan Mohammad, his future new ball partner for Pakistan. The first international visitors to Pakistan were West Indies in November 1948. The last of three fixtures was against a representative side which contained Fazal, he failed to take a wicket in a drawn match. At the end of the 1948‚Äì49 season Pakistan toured Ceylon for four matches, Fazal was the leading wicket-taker with 20 wickets. On the return tour a year later he took 16 wickets in two matches. A MCC side toured the subcontinent in 1951‚Äì52, playing a number of fixtures in Pakistan. In the first match against Punjab they were nearly forced to follow on after Fazal took 5/58. The fifth and final match of the tour was against a Pakistan side on a coir matting wicket at Karachi, Fazal exploited the surface to return figures of 6/40 in the MCC's first innings. The hosts went on to win by four wickets, a victory that played a large part in Pakistan gaining Test status. Pakistan were made Test members on 28 July 1952, less than five years after independence. Test career =First series= In October 1952, Pakistan began their first Test series against India. Fazal made his Test debut in the first match at Delhi, taking 2/92 in India's first innings, his maiden wicket was Indian captain, Lala Amarnath. Pakistan were dismissed cheaply twice to lose by an innings, Fazal was the only Pakistani player to reach double figures in both innings. Pakistan reversed the result in the second Test at Lucknow, played on a jute matting pitch Fazal took 5/52 in the first innings and 7/42 in the second as Pakistan won by an innings in only their second ever Test. His match figures of 12/94 are the best by a Pakistani bowler away from home, and were the best by any bowler against India until 1980. In the third Test at Bombay Fazal was wicketless as Pakistan lost by ten wickets, although in their first innings he scored 33 batting at number eight, helping Pakistan recover from 60/6 to 143/7. The final two Tests of the series were drawn, Fazal took six further wickets to finish his maiden series as Pakistan's leader wicket-taker with 20 at 25.60. He also made some lower order contributions finishing with a series total of 173 runs at 28.83. =England tour= A Pakistan Eaglets side, containing Fazal, was sent to England in 1953 in preparation for the following year's tour of the country. While in England, Fazal received coaching from retired England and Surrey fast bowler Alf Gover. Fazal was made vice-captain to Abdul Kardar for the 1954 tour which would prove a success for both player and team on their first series outside the subcontinent. Fazal began the tour well, taking 11/102 and scoring 67 in the tourists first match against Worcestershire. He continued to take wickets in the lead up to the Test series, and also demonstrated his ability to bowl long and economical spells particularly against Oxford University where he bowled 37 maidens in 68 overs taking 7/95 in the process. The first Test at Lord's was heavily affected by rain and drawn, batting was difficult in the play that was possible and Pakistan were dismissed for 87 in their first innings. England in response scored 117/9 declared with Fazal and Khan Mohammad bowling throughout the innings, Fazal recording figures of 4/54. In the tour match before the next Test Pakistan played Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, the tourists won by eight wickets with Fazal taking 11 wickets including a then career best 8/66 in the first innings. The second Test was at the same venue but saw contrasting fortunes as the Pakistanis suffered a heavy innings defeat and Fazal recorded his worst Test figures of 0/148. Although he was suffering with a leg injury which forced him to shorten his run-up. Pakistan faced another innings defeat after three days of the third Test but the match was drawn after rain stopped any play on the final two days, Fazal took 4/107 from 42 overs in England's innings. Pakistan went to the fourth and final Test at The Oval 1‚Äì0 down but caused a major upset by beating England to level the series, it was the first occasion that a country had won a Test in England on their inaugural tour. Fazal played a leading role in the victory claiming match figures of 12/99. In England's first innings he bowled throughout taking 6/53 from 30 overs, Wisden wrote the figures 'would have been much better but for dropped catches'. In a low scoring match, England were set a target of 168 in their second innings. Despite the early loss of Len Hutton, for the second time in the match caught behind off the bowling of Fazal, at 109/2 England looked well set on the fourth evening. However Fazal took the wickets of Peter May, Godfrey Evans and Denis Compton before the close and the next day took the first two wickets to fall as Pakistan completed a 24-run victory. Fazal's finished with second innings figures of 6/46 from 30 overs. In the series Fazal took 20 wickets, 12 more than the next best Pakistani bowler, at an average of 20.40. He played in only one of the six first-class matches that concluded the tour but still finished as leading wicket-taker with 77 at 17.53. In recognition of his feats, Fazal was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1955, the first Pakistani to be honoured. =Home series= Pakistan's first home series came in the 1954‚Äì55 season with the visit of India for five Test matches. The series was marked by defensive and dull cricket with all five matches being drawn, the first occurrence of this in Test history. Fazal played in four of the matches and took 15 wickets at 21.93. His best figures came in the fifth Test at Karachi where he took 5/48 in India's first innings. Later in 1955 New Zealand made their maiden tour to the country, Pakistan completed a first Test series victory, winning 2‚Äì0. Fazal played in two of the three Tests and took five wickets at 18.40. Australia was the next visitors to Pakistan, touring in October 1956 for a single Test prior to their series in India and following the tour of England. In the match at Karachi, Pakistan secured a historic victory in their first Test against Australia. Fazal played a major role in the win, taking Test best figures of 13/114. He took the first six wickets to fall in Australia's first innings leaving the tourists on 52/6, a position they failed to recover from, they were 80 all out. He also took the first four wickets in the second innings and finished with 7/80. Wisden described his technique: \\"maintaining an accurate length and varying his swing with a mixture of leg-cutters and breakbacks\\". Imtiaz Ahmed said that: \\"Fazal never wavered in length and direction, and he moved the ball both ways intelligently...For one whole over from Fazal in the first innings, even the great Miller had no clue.\\" =Tour of West Indies= Pakistan's tour of the West Indies in 1958 was marked by a number of high scoring Test matches and Fazal had a large workload, sending down over 320 overs in the five Test series including 186 in consecutive Tests. Pakistan lost the series 3‚Äì1 and only avoided defeat in the first Test thanks to the 16-hour innings of 337 by Hanif Mohammad. In the second Test at Trinidad Fazal was Pakistan's most economical bowler collecting six wickets in the process, while as batsman he scored 60 from number 10, his highest Test score and only fifty at international level. The third Test at Kingston was historic as Gary Sobers scored 365 not out, breaking the Test record for highest individual score. Injuries to fellow opening bowler Mahmood Hussain and spinner Nasim-ul-Ghani meant that Fazal sent down 85.2 overs, what Wisden described as 'a phenomenal number of overs for a bowler of his pace'. Fazal conceded 247 runs in the innings and took the only two wickets to fall. Fazal's bowling analysis places him fifth in Test history for most overs bowled and most runs conceded in an innings. Pakistan lost the Test by an innings and by losing the next match in Guyana they lost the series. Pakistan achieved a consolation victory in the fifth Test, Fazal taking 6/83 in the first innings including the wicket of Conrad Hunte with the first ball of the match. Fazal finished the series with 20 wickets at 38.20, despite being one of his worst in terms of average, he was still Pakistan's leading wicket-taker. =Captaincy= By the time of the return tour the following year, Abdul Kardar, captain of Pakistan since their Test election, had retired from Test cricket. Fazal, the nation's leading bowler, succeeded him in the role. In his first Test as captain he won the toss and decided to field, opening the bowling he took the wicket of Conrad Hunte in the first over for the second successive Test. Fazal finished the innings with figures of 4/32 which also included dismissing Gary Sobers for a duck. Fazal took three further wickets in the second innings including both Hunte and Sobers, the latter's wicket was Fazal's 100th in Test cricket, the first Pakistani to reach the landmark. Pakistan completed a ten wicket victory to give their new captain a winning start. Pakistan also won the next Test at Dhaka and therefore completed a series win in the three match rubber. In a low scoring match Fazal played an instrumental role, taking ten wickets in a match for the fourth time in Tests. Put in to bat, Pakistan recovered from 22/5 to make 145. West Indies fared worse, being dismissed for 76 following a collapse of six wickets for 11 runs. Fazal bowled throughout the innings, taking 6/34. West Indies, set 214 in their fourth innings, fell 41 runs short. Fazal taking six of the first seven wickets, the other dismissal that of Sobers by Mahmood Hussain involved Fazal as the catcher. Mahmood finished off the tail to claim four wickets while Fazal ended with figures of 6/66 and a match analysis of 12/100. The latter were the best figures by a bowler whilst captain until 1993, when bettered by Waqar Younis. The third Test, a dead rubber, was won by the West Indies. Fazal dismissed both openers but these were his only wickets in 40 overs. He was the leading wicket-taker in the series with 21 at 15.85. Australia toured Pakistan at the end of 1959 for a three Test series which they won 2‚Äì0, Pakistan's first series defeat at home. In the first Test at Dacca the tourists won by eight wickets, Fazal claimed six wickets including a first innings five-for, 5/71. He missed the second Test at his home city of Lahore, wicket-keeper Imtiaz Ahmed taking over captaincy duties in a match Australia won by seven wickets. Fazal returned for the third Test in Karachi and took another five wicket haul with 5/74 in Australia's first innings. Pakistan gained a lead on first innings but after three early wickets their second innings slowed and the match petered out to a draw. Despite missing a match Fazal was Pakistan's leading wicket-taker for the series, taking 11 at 19.36. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowlers ranking for 1959. Pakistan toured India during the 1960‚Äì61 season but with little reward as all 15 matches on their tour, including five Tests, were drawn. Just as seven years previous, the series contained dour and defensive cricket as both sides appeared intent on avoiding defeat rather than attempting to win. Fazal won the toss in the first four Tests but only in the third Test at Eden Gardens did Pakistan gain a first innings lead. In that match Fazal took 5/26 off 25.3 overs, but he failed to take a wicket in India's second innings as they batted out time comfortably. Apart from that five-for, his 13th and last in Test cricket, Fazal took only four other wickets in the series. Fazal's captaincy received severe criticism with accusations of favouritism, and following the final Test he was sacked as captain. =Final Tests= Fazal wasn't initially selected by Pakistan for the home series against England but returned for the final Test. He was as economical as ever, conceding 98 runs from his 63 overs, but failed to take a wicket. He wasn't included in the 1962 tour squad to England but was called up as a replacement when fast bowlers Mahmood Hussain and Mohammad Farooq broke down injured. The five match series already lost, Fazal came into the team for the fourth Test at Trent Bridge. He shouldered much of the workload, bowling for all but 30 minutes of the second day and continuing throughout on the third morning until the England declaration, from his 60 overs he took 3/130. In the fifth Test at The Oval, he was expensive taking 2/192 from 47 overs, the two wickets, which proved to be his last in Test cricket, were those of Colin Cowdrey (182) and Ted Dexter (172). League Cricket =Lancashire League= Fazal spent three seasons as the professional with the East Lancashire Cricket Club in 1957, 1958, and 1959. Playing against albeit excellent amateur cricketers his bowling was devastating. In three memorable seasons he took 4 hat-tricks, with 8 wickets on 2 occasions and 7 wickets on 6 occasions, including 7 for 9 in 1959, and 7 for 26 in 1957. Outside cricket After leaving Islamia College with a master's degree in Economics, Fazal joined the Pakistan Services as an Inspector of Police in 1947 rising to Deputy Superintendent in 1952 and Deputy Inspector General in 1976. Due to his good looks, he had many movie offers : during Pakistan's first tour of India, in 1952-1953, famous director Mehboob Khan offered him a second-lead role in the movie Aan (1952), while well-known American director George Cukor, while on a visit in Lahore and meeting Mahmood, said he would have preferred him as the lead role in his 1956-movie Bhowani Junction, instead of Stewart Granger. He refused them to concentrate on cricket.Richard Heller, Peter Oborne, White on Green: A Portrait of Pakistan Cricket, Simon and Schuster (2016), chapter 22 Quitting cricket, he also became more religious in his outlook, and notably published, in 1970, the book Urge To Faith, where he outlines his vision of applying Islamic principles to the economy and social system of Pakistan, and which has been described by journalist Peter Oborne as \\"a meditation on religion, philosophy and politics. The book demonstrates a profound faith and learning, containing many relevant quotations from the Quran. Fazal doubted whether ‚Äòa democracy of western type‚Äô was capable of bringing about Islamic justice.\\" He also acted as a muezzin for the local mosque in his old age, and established a school for girls, the Sidra Model School, using the plot of rural land he was gifted after the 1954 Oval victory.Peter Oborne, Wounded Tiger: A History of Cricket in Pakistan, Simon and Schuster (2015), pp. 502-503 His autobiography has been published by the Oxford University Press, in 2003, as From Dusk to Dawn: Autobiography of a Pakistan Cricket Legend. Fazal suffered a fatal heart attack at his Lahore residence on 30 May 2005. His friend and former teammate Hanif Mohammad described Fazal as a \\"great human being\\" and \\"the doyen of Pakistan bowlers in the country's formative years\\". Fazal Mahmood married the daughter of Mohammad Saeed, Pakistani cricket's captain. Awards and recognition *Pride of Performance Award in 1958 by the Government of PakistanFazal Mahmood's Pride of Performance Award listed on Pakistan Sports Board website Retrieved 5 July 2019 In 2012, he was posthumously awarded Hilal-i-Imtiaz in recognition of his contribution to Pakistan's cricket. Records and statistics Fazal was the first bowler in the history of Test cricket to take 12 or more wickets in a Test match against four different countries, those being India, England, Australia, and West Indies. He reached 100 Test wickets in 22 Tests, of Pakistan bowlers only Waqar Younis and Mohammad Asif reached the landmark quicker.

Early life Maybanke Anderson n√©e Selfe was born at Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom, near the city London. She was the sister of Norman Selfe and a cousin of Eadward Muybridge, who migrated to the United States in 1850. Her family migrated to Australia as free settlers when she was nine years old. Twelve years later in September 1867 she married Edmund Kay Wolstenholme, a timber merchant. The couple had seven children between 1868 and 1879, four of them died from a heart condition before the age of five. Her son, Harry Wolstenholme, was a lawyer and keen amateur ornithologist. The Wolstenholmes built a large house called 'Maybanke' in Marrickville. The later years of the marriage were unhappy; Edmund had a number of business failures and became an alcoholic, leaving the family in 1884. Maybanke had to wait for the passage of the Divorce Amendment and Extension Act in 1892 before she could divorce Edmund on the grounds of \\"three years of desertion.\\" The divorce was finalised in 1893. p.37 After the divorce, she was supported financially by her brother, the renowned engineer Norman Selfe, with whom she would later campaign for education reform. In 1885 Maybanke opened Maybanke School, a girls' school that she operated in her home preparing girls for the University of Sydney entrance examination. Operating for 10 years, the school was later known as Maybanke College.Nugent, A. 2001. Maybanke Anderson Feminist, Suffragist and Federationist, National Library of Australia News, Volume XI Number 8. p. 14 Maybanke Kindergarten in Pyrmont, New South Wales, named after Anderson Woman suffrage activist Following her divorce, Maybanke took an active role in the promotion of women and children's rights. She became active in the women's suffrage movement; she believed that the vote was 'the kernel for all reform'. She was vice president of the Women's Literary Society started by her friend Rose Scott. Many of the society's members would go on to form the Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales (WSL) on 6 May 1891. In 1893 she was elected to the WSL presidency, and founded the Australasian Home Reading Union in the same year. The Union was a program to promote induction by organising small study groups in rural areas. In 1894, she began publishing the fortnightly newspaper Woman's Voice. The paper ran for 18 months, drawing women's attention to suffrage issues at the national and international level. In 1895 she established the first free kindergarten in Australia at Woolloomooloo as the president of the Kindergarten Union, helping the children of working mothers. The WSL's attempts to have suffrage implemented by the New South Wales government were not fruitful; however, in 1897, Maybanke decided to petition the 1897 Federal Convention in Adelaide. She reasoned that this would have the women's vote written into the Federal agenda. Thus, the women from South and Western Australia who already had the vote could not have it taken from them, and if there was suffrage at the federal level, it would flow down to the states. At this time, she also became involved in the pro- federation movement. Maybanke resigned from the WSL in 1897. Suffrage was extended to the women of New South Wales in 1902. Maybanke was inducted onto the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001 in recognition of her achievements. Marriage and travel In 1899 Maybanke married her second husband, Sir Francis Anderson. Anderson was the first Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney. They travelled and worked together on voluntary projects, including campaigning to have women stand for local government. She was active with the National Council of Women of New South Wales, and worked closely with the University Women's Society. Maybanke died in St Germain-en- Laye, Paris on 15 April 1927.

CAN was one of the original four distributed hash table proposals, introduced concurrently with Chord, Pastry, and Tapestry. Overview Like other distributed hash tables, CAN is designed to be scalable, fault tolerant, and self-organizing. The architectural design is a virtual multi-dimensional Cartesian coordinate space, a type of overlay network, on a multi-torus. This n-dimensional coordinate space is a virtual logical address, completely independent of the physical location and physical connectivity of the nodes. Points within the space are identified with coordinates. The entire coordinate space is dynamically partitioned among all the nodes in the system such that every node possesses at least one distinct zone within the overall space. Routing A CAN node maintains a routing table that holds the IP address and virtual coordinate zone of each of its neighbors. A node routes a message towards a destination point in the coordinate space. The node first determines which neighboring zone is closest to the destination point, and then looks up that zone's node's IP address via the routing table. Node joining To join a CAN, a joining node must: # Find a node already in the overlay network. # Identify a zone that can be split # Update the routing tables of nodes neighboring the newly split zone. To find a node already in the overlay network, bootstrapping nodes may be used to inform the joining node of IP addresses of nodes currently in the overlay network. After the joining node receives an IP address of a node already in the CAN, it can attempt to identify a zone for itself. The joining node randomly picks a point in the coordinate space and sends a join request, directed to the random point, to one of the received IP addresses. The nodes already in the overlay network route the join request to the correct device via their zone-to-IP routing tables. Once the node managing the destination point's zone receives the join request, it may honor the join request by splitting its zone in half, allocating itself the first half, and allocating the joining node the second half. If it does not honor the join request, the joining node keeps picking random points in the coordinate space and sending join requests directed to these random points until it successfully joins the network. After the zone split and allocation is complete, the neighboring nodes are updated with the coordinates of the two new zones and the corresponding IP addresses. Routing tables are updated and updates are propagated across the network. Node departing To handle a node departing, the CAN must # identify a node is departing # have the departing node's zone merged or taken over by a neighboring node # update the routing tables across the network. Detecting a node's departure can be done, for instance, via heartbeat messages that periodically broadcast routing table information between neighbors. After a predetermined period of silence from a neighbor, that neighboring node is determined as failed and is considered a departing node. Alternatively, a node that is willingly departing may broadcast such a notice to its neighbors. After a departing node is identified, its zone must be either merged or taken over. First the departed node's zone is analyzed to determine whether a neighboring node's zone can merge with the departed node's zone to form a valid zone. For example, a zone in a 2d coordinate space must be either a square or rectangle and cannot be L-shaped. The validation test may cycle through all neighboring zones to determine if a successful merge can occur. If one of the potential merges is deemed a valid merge, the zones are then merged. If none of the potential merges are deemed valid, then the neighboring node with the smallest zone takes over control of the departing node's zone. After a take-over, the take-over node may periodically attempt to merge its additionally controlled zones with respective neighboring zones. If the merge is successful, routing tables of neighboring zones' nodes are updated to reflect the merge. The network will see the subsection of the overlay network as one, single zone after a merge and treat all routing processing with this mindset. To effectuate a take-over, the take-over node updates neighboring zones' nodes' routing tables, so that requests to either zone resolve to the take-over node. And, as such, the network still sees the subsection of the overlay network as two separate zones and treats all routing processing with this mindset.

H. Downing, SAGE Reference, 2011, pp. 423-424. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Founded in 1998 by a small group of radio activists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Prometheus has participated in the community radio movement by providing technical training, helping marginalized communities gain access to affordable media outlets, and creating a network of low power community radio stations. A lot of Prometheus' efforts have focused on legal advocacy for low- power FM (LPFM) stations.Dunbar-Hester, Christina. Low Power to the People : Pirates, Protest, and Politics in FM Radio Activism, MIT Press, 2014. p.2  Origins  The Prometheus Radio Project evolved out of Radio Mutiny, an unlicensed station based in West Philadelphia which broadcast in the mid-1990s. Radio Mutiny was shut down by the FCC in 1998. In response, the Radio Mutiny organizers held a protest at Benjamin Franklin's printing press and stated that \\"for every station [the FCC] harassed or shut down, we would teach people to build ten more.\\" After Radio Mutiny came to an end, some of the pirate broadcasters involved formed the Prometheus Radio Project in order to advocate for new low-power FM licenses and help community groups to establish independent radio stations.  Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC  In 2003 the Federal Communications Commission, under Chairman Michael Powell, sought to significantly relax media outlet ownership regulations. In Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC, a number of broadcasters and citizens groups, including the Consumer Federation of America, the National Council of Churches of Christ, and Media Alliance, sued to prevent the FCC from following through on the decision. Prometheus was represented by Andrew Jay Schwartzman and Cheryl Leanza of the Media Access Project. On September 3, 2003, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay which prevented the new rules from being enforced pending the outcome of the litigation. In 2004, the majority ruled 2‚Äì1 in favor of Prometheus and mandated the FCC re-examine its media ownership rules. They ruled that a \\"diversity index\\" used by the FCC to weigh cross-ownership (of radio, television and newspapers) employed several \\"irrational assumptions and inconsistencies.\\" Dissent by Chief Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica noted that the majority were simply employing their own assumptions.Summary of the Third Circuit Court's ruling on Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC from the Media Access Project . The Supreme Court later turned down an appeal, so the decision stands. The FCC was ordered to reconfigure how it justifies raising ownership limits.  Barnraisings  Studying the console at the WMXP-LP Barnraising, June 2007. In the spirit of the Amish barn-raising tradition, where a community comes together and erects an essential structure, Prometheus holds radio barnraisings. These events bring together the local community with community radio advocates from around the world to build a community radio station, while advancing the movement for media democracy. Prometheus barnraisings gather Low Power FM radio advocates, journalists, radio engineers, students, lawyers, musicians, activists and other folks from across the country to build a studio, raise an antenna mast, and put the station on air for the first time ‚Äì all over the course of three days. At a typical barnraising, the organization invites expert facilitators to lead workshops on a wide variety of topics, like understanding the workings of the FCC, introductions to various aspects of radio engineering, updates on media and democracy campaigns, and how radio can promote social change today. In the inclusive spirit of Prometheus's mission, the events are open to the public.

Prometheus Involvement with the Local Community Radio Act  For many years, Prometheus has strived to gain community members and nonprofit groups a fair share of the radio spectrum. Most recently, Prometheus was involved in the passing of the Local Radio Community Act. The act, proposed in 2009, opened up a portion of the radio spectrum to low-power community radio stations (LPFMs). Before then, community members could apply for licenses for full-power stations, which are five to ten times as expensive as LPFMs. Those groups who did not have the capital to build a full-power station were forced into piracy. The Prometheus Radio Project did everything possible to ensure the passage of the Local Community Radio Act. Members of the organization discovered that while the bill circulated in Congress, secret holds were put on it to prevent its passage. People who opposed the bill, like Senator Gordon Smith ‚Äì the president of the National Association of Broadcasterswww.nabef.org/documents/board/gordonSmith.asp. ‚Äì were persuading other senators to vote against it. The moment the Prometheus Radio Project found out about this, members began contacting all the citizens they could. They encouraged their contacts to call their senators to show they were aware of these holds. Their efforts turned out to be successful when the Local Community Radio Act was finally passed in 2010.Everhart, K. (2011, January 11) For LPFMers, radio act brings a ‚Äòton of joy.‚Äô Current. Retrieved from www.current.org/radio/radio1101lpfm-bill.shtml . What signing this act means is that ‚Äúthe FCC [has] a new mandate to expand low power radio,‚Äù says Brandy Doyle, Policy Director for the Prometheus Radio Project. However, the FCC will not begin to automatically handout licenses. Doyle states that ‚Äúwe think the FCC will need to do a rule making to clarify the intent of the new law and update the rules going forward.‚Äù (Doyle) Because of this act more groups will soon start to apply for licenses and they will need a lot of support in order to ‚Äúnavigate the process‚Äù says Vanessa Maria Graber, Community Radio Director at the Prometheus Radio Project.

According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. Before the advent of general relativity, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses, even though Newton himself did not regard the theory as the final word on the nature of gravity. Within a century of Newton's formulation, careful astronomical observation revealed unexplainable variations between the theory and the observations. Under Newton's model, gravity was the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was bothered by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion. However, experiments and observations show that Einstein's description accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in the orbits of Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, while others are the subject of ongoing research. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology. Creation of general relativity = Early investigations = As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was the preference of inertial motion within special relativity, while a theory which from the outset prefers no particular state of motion appeared more satisfactory to him.Albert Einstein, Nobel lecture in 1921 So, while still working at the patent office in 1907, Einstein had what he would call his \\"happiest thought\\". He realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields. Consequently, in 1907 he wrote an article (published 1908) on acceleration under special relativity. page 454 (Wir betrachen zwei Bewegung systeme ...) In that article, he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the Equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of gravitational time dilation. In 1911, Einstein published another article expanding on the 1907 article. (also in Collected Papers Vol. 3, document 23) There, he thought about the case of a uniformly accelerated box not in a gravitational field, and noted that it would be indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field. He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks at the top of a box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation. Also the deflection of light by massive bodies was predicted. Although the approximation was crude, it allowed him to calculate that the deflection is nonzero. German astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich publicized Einstein's challenge to scientists around the world.Crelinsten, Jeffrey. \\"Einstein's Jury: The Race to Test Relativity \\". Princeton University Press. 2006. Retrieved on 13 March 2007. This urged astronomers to detect the deflection of light during a solar eclipse, and gave Einstein confidence that the scalar theory of gravity proposed by Gunnar Nordstr√∂m was incorrect. But the actual value for the deflection that he calculated was too small by a factor of two, because the approximation he used doesn't work well for things moving at near the speed of light. When Einstein finished the full theory of general relativity, he would rectify this error and predict the correct amount of light deflection by the sun. Another of Einstein's notable thought experiments about the nature of the gravitational field is that of the rotating disk (a variant of the Ehrenfest paradox). He imagined an observer performing experiments on a rotating turntable. He noted that such an observer would find a different value for the mathematical constant œÄ than the one predicted by Euclidean geometry. The reason is that the radius of a circle would be measured with an uncontracted ruler, but, according to special relativity, the circumference would seem to be longer because the ruler would be contracted. Since Einstein believed that the laws of physics were local, described by local fields, he concluded from this that spacetime could be locally curved. This led him to study Riemannian geometry, and to formulate general relativity in this language. =Developing general relativity= In 1912, Einstein returned to Switzerland to accept a professorship at his alma mater, ETH Zurich. Once back in Zurich, he immediately visited his old ETH classmate Marcel Grossmann, now a professor of mathematics, who introduced him to Riemannian geometry and, more generally, to differential geometry. On the recommendation of Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita, Einstein began exploring the usefulness of general covariance (essentially the use of tensors) for his gravitational theory. For a while Einstein thought that there were problems with the approach, but he later returned to it and, by late 1915, had published his general theory of relativity in the form in which it is used today.O'Connor, J.J. and E.F. Robertson (1996), \\"General relativity\\". Mathematical Physics index, School of Mathematics and Statistics , University of St. Andrews, Scotland, May 1996. Retrieved 4 February 2015. This theory explains gravitation as distortion of the structure of spacetime by matter, affecting the inertial motion of other matter. During World War I, the work of Central Powers scientists was available only to Central Powers academics, for national security reasons. Some of Einstein's work did reach the United Kingdom and the United States through the efforts of the Austrian Paul Ehrenfest and physicists in the Netherlands, especially 1902 Nobel Prize- winner Hendrik Lorentz and Willem de Sitter of Leiden University. After the war ended, Einstein maintained his relationship with Leiden University, accepting a contract as an Extraordinary Professor; for ten years, from 1920 to 1930, he travelled to the Netherlands regularly to lecture. In 1917, several astronomers accepted Einstein's 1911 challenge from Prague. The Mount Wilson Observatory in California, U.S., published a solar spectroscopic analysis that showed no gravitational redshift. In 1918, the Lick Observatory, also in California, announced that it too had disproved Einstein's prediction, although its findings were not published. However, in May 1919, a team led by the British astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington claimed to have confirmed Einstein's prediction of gravitational deflection of starlight by the sun while photographing a solar eclipse with dual expeditions in Sobral, northern Brazil, and Pr√≠ncipe, a west African island. Nobel laureate Max Born praised general relativity as the \\"greatest feat of human thinking about nature\\"; fellow laureate Paul Dirac was quoted saying it was \\"probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made\\".J√ºrgen Schmidhuber. \\"Albert Einstein (1879‚Äì1955) and the 'Greatest Scientific Discovery Ever'\\". 2006. Retrieved on 4 October 2006. There have been claims that scrutiny of the specific photographs taken on the Eddington expedition showed the experimental uncertainty to be comparable to the same magnitude as the effect Eddington claimed to have demonstrated, and that a 1962 British expedition concluded that the method was inherently unreliable. The deflection of light during a solar eclipse was confirmed by later, more accurate observations.See the table in MathPages Bending Light Some resented the newcomer's fame, notably among some German physicists, who later started the Deutsche Physik (German Physics) movement.For a discussion of astronomers' attitudes and debates about relativity, see , especially chapters 6, 9, 10 and 11. =General covariance and the hole argument= By 1912, Einstein was actively seeking a theory in which gravitation was explained as a geometric phenomenon. At the urging of Tullio Levi-Civita, Einstein began by exploring the use of general covariance (which is essentially the use of curvature tensors) to create a gravitational theory. However, in 1913 Einstein abandoned that approach, arguing that it is inconsistent based on the \\"hole argument\\". In 1914 and much of 1915, Einstein was trying to create field equations based on another approach. When that approach was proven to be inconsistent, Einstein revisited the concept of general covariance and discovered that the hole argument was flawed. =The development of the Einstein field equations= When Einstein realized that general covariance was tenable, he quickly completed the development of the field equations that are named after him. However, he made a now-famous mistake. The field equations he published in October 1915 were :R_{\\\\mu u} = T_{\\\\mu u}\\\\,, where R_{\\\\mu u} is the Ricci tensor, and T_{\\\\mu u} the energy‚Äìmomentum tensor. This predicted the non-Newtonian perihelion precession of Mercury, and so had Einstein very excited. However, it was soon realized that they were inconsistent with the local conservation of energy‚Äìmomentum unless the universe had a constant density of mass‚Äìenergy‚Äìmomentum. In other words, air, rock and even a vacuum should all have the same density. This inconsistency with observation sent Einstein back to the drawing board and, on 25 November 1915, Einstein presented the updated Einstein field equations to the Prussian Academy of Sciences: :R_{\\\\mu u} - {1\\\\over 2}R g_{\\\\mu u} = T_{\\\\mu u}, where R is the Ricci scalar and g_{\\\\mu u} the metric tensor. With the publication of the field equations, the issue became one of solving them for various cases and interpreting the solutions. This and experimental verification have dominated general relativity research ever since. =Einstein and Hilbert= Although Einstein is credited with finding the field equations, the German mathematician David Hilbert published them in an article before Einstein's article. This has resulted in accusations of plagiarism against Einstein, although not from Hilbert, and assertions that the field equations should be called the \\"Einstein‚ÄìHilbert field equations\\". However, Hilbert did not press his claim for priority and some have asserted that Einstein submitted the correct equations before Hilbert amended his own work to include them. This suggests that Einstein developed the correct field equations first, though Hilbert may have reached them later independently (or even learned of them afterwards through his correspondence with Einstein). However, others have criticized those assertions. =Sir Arthur Eddington= In the early years after Einstein's theory was published, Sir Arthur Eddington lent his considerable prestige in the British scientific establishment in an effort to champion the work of this German scientist. Because the theory was so complex and abstruse (even today it is popularly considered the pinnacle of scientific thinking; in the early years it was even more so), it was rumored that only three people in the world understood it. There was an illuminating, though probably apocryphal, anecdote about this. As related by Ludwik Silberstein,John Waller (2002), Einstein's Luck, Oxford University Press, during one of Eddington's lectures he asked \\"Professor Eddington, you must be one of three persons in the world who understands general relativity.\\" Eddington paused, unable to answer. Silberstein continued \\"Don't be modest, Eddington!\\" Finally, Eddington replied \\"On the contrary, I'm trying to think who the third person is.\\" Solutions = The Schwarzschild solution = Since the field equations are non-linear, Einstein assumed that they were unsolvable. However, Karl Schwarzschild discovered in 1915 and published in 1916, an exact solution for the case of a spherically symmetric spacetime surrounding a massive object in spherical coordinates. This is now known as the Schwarzschild solution. Since then, many other exact solutions have been found. =The expanding universe and the cosmological constant= In 1922, Alexander Friedmann found a solution in which the universe may expand or contract, and later Georges Lema√Ætre derived a solution for an expanding universe. However, Einstein believed that the universe was apparently static, and since a static cosmology was not supported by the general relativistic field equations, he added a cosmological constant Œõ to the field equations, which became :R_{\\\\mu u} - {1\\\\over 2}R g_{\\\\mu u} + \\\\Lambda g_{\\\\mu u} = T_{\\\\mu u}. This permitted the creation of steady-state solutions, but they were unstable: the slightest perturbation of a static state would result in the universe expanding or contracting. In 1929, Edwin Hubble found evidence for the idea that the universe is expanding. This resulted in Einstein dropping the cosmological constant, referring to it as \\"the biggest blunder in my career\\". At the time, it was an ad hoc hypothesis to add in the cosmological constant, as it was only intended to justify one result (a static universe). =More exact solutions= Progress in solving the field equations and understanding the solutions has been ongoing. The solution for a spherically symmetric charged object was discovered by Reissner and later rediscovered by Nordstr√∂m, and is called the Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m solution. The black hole aspect of the Schwarzschild solution was very controversial, and Einstein did not believe that singularities could be real. However, in 1957 (two years after Einstein's death in 1955), Martin Kruskal published a proof that black holes are called for by the Schwarzschild solution. Additionally, the solution for a rotating massive object was obtained by Roy Kerr in the 1960s and is called the Kerr solution. The Kerr‚ÄìNewman solution for a rotating, charged massive object was published a few years later. Testing the theory The first piece of evidence in support of general relativity came from its correct prediction of the anomalous rate of precession of Mercury's orbit. Subsequently, Arthur Stanley Eddington's 1919 expedition confirmed Einstein's prediction of the deflection of light by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of 29 May 1919, which helped to cement the status of general relativity as a viable theory. Since then, many observations have shown agreement with the predictions of general relativity. These include studies of binary pulsars, observations of radio signals passing the limb of the Sun, and even the global positioning system. First image of the event horizon of a black hole (M87*) captured by the Event Horizon Telescope The theory predicts gravitational waves, which are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that propagate as waves, travelling outward from the source. The first observation of gravitational waves, which came from the merger of two black holes, was made on 14 September 2015 by the Advanced LIGO team, corroborating another prediction of the theory 100 years after it was published. The first image of a black hole, the supermassive one at the center of galaxy Messier 87, was published by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration on 10 April 2019.  Alternative theories There have been various attempts to find modifications to general relativity. The most famous of these are the Brans‚ÄìDicke theory (also known as scalar-tensor theory), and Rosen's bimetric theory. Both of these theories proposed changes to the field equations of general relativity, and both suffer from these changes permitting the presence of bipolar gravitational radiation. As a result, Rosen's original theory has been refuted by observations of binary pulsars. As for Brans‚ÄìDicke (which has a tunable parameter œâ such that œâ = ‚àû is the same as general relativity), the amount by which it can differ from general relativity has been severely constrained by these observations. In addition, general relativity is inconsistent with quantum mechanics, the physical theory that describes the wave‚Äìparticle duality of matter, and quantum mechanics does not currently describe gravitational attraction at relevant (microscopic) scales. There is a great deal of speculation in the physics community as to the modifications that might be needed to both general relativity and quantum mechanics in order to unite them consistently. The speculative theory that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics is usually called quantum gravity, prominent examples of which include String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity. Golden age Kip Thorne identifies the \\"golden age of general relativity\\" as the period roughly from 1960 to 1975 during which the study of general relativity, Extract of page 74 which had previously been regarded as something of a curiosity, entered the mainstream of theoretical physics.In Black holes and time warps, chapter 7 \\"The Golden Age\\" Kip Thorne writes: The black holes [Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar] was analyzing were radically different beasts from those of the early 1960s, when physicists had begun to embrace the concept of a black hole. The intervening decade had been a golden age of black-hole research, an era that revolutionized our understanding of general relativity‚Äôs predictions. During this period, many of the concepts and terms which continue to inspire the imagination of gravitation researchers and the general public were introduced, including black holes and 'gravitational singularity'. At the same time, in a closely related development, the study of physical cosmology entered the mainstream and the Big Bang became well established. Fulvio Melia refers frequently to the \\"golden age of relativity\\" in his book Cracking the Einstein Code. Andrzej Trautman hosted a relativity conference in Warsaw in 1962 to which Melia refers: :General relativity moved very successfully from that meeting in Warsaw, hot on the heels of the Pound‚ÄìRebka experiment, and entered its golden age of discovery that lasted into the mid-1970s.Fulvio Melia (2009) Cracking the Einstein Code, page 50, University of Chicago Press Roy Kerr, protagonist of the book, contributed an Afterword, saying of the book: \\"It is a remarkable piece of writing capturing beautifully the period we now refer to as the golden age of relativity.\\"Roy Kerr (2009) Afterword, Cracking the Einstein Code, page 127 See also *Contributors to general relativity *Golden age of cosmology *Golden age of physics *Mach's principle *W.

It was founded by Monsignor Joseph Jessing in 1888 and is the only papal college in North America. The seminary prepares its students to become priests in the Roman Catholic Church. Students come from U.S. dioceses that do not have their own seminaries, as well as dioceses from around the world. The Josephinum, which means \\"House of Joseph\\", was granted pontifical status in 1892 by Pope Leo XIII, recognizing its unique mission of forming priests for the international Catholic Church. History =Overview= Monsignor Joseph Jessing, seen here in 1896 wearing decorations from his years in the Prussian Army, founded the Josephinum in 1888.Founded in 1888, the Josephinum was the religious vocational outgrowth of an orphanage and orphan's industries, founded by Msgr. Joseph Jessing, in the early 1870s and relocated to Columbus. In 1888, Jessing founded the Collegium Josephinum, as it was then known. It was granted pontifical college status in 1892 by Pope Leo XIII and renamed to its current name, thus becoming, and remaining, the only pontifical seminary in the Western Hemisphere. =Background= In the 1870s, inspired by the orphanage work of Father Jessing, when four older boys indicated a desire to serve the Church as Roman Catholic priests, Father Jessing advertised in his German- language newspaper that he would be willing to sponsor two boys who wished to become priests but who lacked the financial means to do so. Jessing accepted twenty-three of the more than forty applicants who replied. Originally his new seminary was called the Collegium Josephinum and was located in downtown Columbus. As those first students progressed through the seminary program, the institution initially provided six years of primary education (\\"minor seminary,\\" four years of high school and two years of college/pre-theology) and six years of secondary seminary education (\\"major seminary,\\" another two years of college/pre-theology and four years of theology/ seminary). Father Jessing lived to see the first class of six seminarians ordained to the priesthood in June 1899 but he died less than six months later. =Pontifical status= Pope Leo XIII granted pontifical status to the Josephinum with this hand-written, Latin letter in 1892.To make sure that the fledgling institution would continue after his death, Father Jessing asked that it be placed under the protection of the Holy See. Pope Leo XIII granted the request in 1892, thus making the new institution, the Pontifical College Josephinum, the only pontifical seminary outside of Italy. From that time to the present, the institution has been under the direction of the Congregation for Catholic Education, with the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States as its Chancellor. Today, the seminary is financially independent from both the Holy See and the Diocese of Columbus. =Relocation to present campus= In 1931, the Josephinum moved to its present location just north of Worthington, Ohio and eleven miles (18 km) north of downtown Columbus on a landmark campus. (The current size of the campus is slightly less than with another approximately parcel close by.) The new complex was designed by architect Frank A. Ludewig. The academic structure of the seminary changed over time during the 1940s and 1950s from the \\"six-six\\" format to four years of high school, four years of college, and four years of theology/seminary (though the distinctions were gradual and unclear). Reflecting the German origins of its founder and its service to the German-speaking community, the seminary high school and college held almost all classes in German until the influx of non-German speaking students made this no longer practical. The first official College commencement occurred in June 1953; the College and Recreation buildings were dedicated in 1958; and the high school closed in 1967. For the first few decades of its existence, the seminary focused its work on educating priests to work with the large population of German immigrants in the United States. The Josephinum was incorporated in Ohio in 1894; its Constitution was first approved by Pope Pius XI in 1938 and was most recently revised and approved by the Congregation for Catholic Education in 1996. =Modernization and increasing international focus= The Josephinum's Saint Joseph oratory In the years after World War I, the focus of the seminary shifted away from its original mission of meeting the spiritual needs of German-speaking Catholics to a wider mission of preparing priests for dioceses throughout the United States that lacked their own seminary. With the advent of the Second Vatican Council in 1962, the Church took on a more outward-looking and evangelical orientation. It was only natural that seminaries like The Josephinum also become increasingly involved in outreach and ministry work in their local communities. This trend continues today, along with many other initiatives. The Very Reverend Steven P. Beseau STD assumed leadership of the Pontifical College Josephinum on October 1, 2019. Josephinum alumni serve the Church in 48 states and 22 foreign countries. The Josephinum continues to prepare priests for U.S. dioceses that do not have their own seminaries, missionary areas of the United States, including regions of the U.S. with growing Hispanic communities and finally, dioceses around the world in need of help with the education of their seminarians. Accreditation and certifications Led by a decades long effort by its most significant graduate and 20th Century leader, Msgr. Leonard J. Fick, the Josephinum was accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, an affiliate of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1976. The Josephinum has been accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada since 1970. The seminary also holds a Certificate of Authorization from the Ohio Board of Regents.

History The station's track was once used by Toronto and Nipissing Railway and later Grand Trunk Railway and finally by CN Rail. TNR opened a station at Agincourt in 1871 (not to be mistaken for CPR Agincourt station located further east) and was later demolished and not replaced until GO established service in the area in 1982 (and renovated a station structure in the 1990s). In 2018, EllisDon Transit Infrastructure was awarded a contract to expand the station for increased Regional Express Rail service. The project will include construction of a second platform, improved pedestrian and vehicle connections, and a new station building. The project is expected to be completed by December 2020. Connecting transit The Toronto Transit Commission's 85 Sheppard East and 985 Sheppard East Express bus routes links Agincourt Station to Don Mills station in the west, the 85 and 985B continues east into Scarborough while the 985A continues express to Scarborough Centre station. The proposed Sheppard East LRT would create a grade-separation of the rail line at Sheppard Avenue East (this started in December, 2009), with a connection from the LRT platform to the GO platform. But now it seems that plans have been made to build a second track from Agincourt to Markham GO so the line will operate on weekends. The Rob Ford administration saw a cancellation of the LRT projects, with an intended Sheppard subway line extension; however, on March 22, 2012 Toronto City council voted to reinstate the Sheppard LRT project and construction should restart sometime within the next few years. Underpass construction Since the Sheppard LRT project was a plan back in 2010, it required a grade separation of Sheppard Avenue East and the GO train tracks. This led contractors from the City of Toronto government and TTC to build a bridge for the GO train tracks, while having Sheppard Avenue move under it, as the light rail vehicles would not have been able to cross the GO tracks at ground level. On July 3, 2012 the underpass was completed and opened to regular traffic, which was five months ahead of schedule. Not only does this improve the flow of traffic along Sheppard Avenue, as vehicles no longer have to wait at a rail crossing, it also improves GO train service. The bridge will also allow two-way service on this portion of the line. Building the bridge also meant that the parking capacity of the station could be expanded. Before the project, parking capacity was only 297 and now it has been increased to 342 spaces.

It is located in the neighbourhood of Milliken, Ontario.See Isabel Champion, ed., Markham: 1793-1900 (Markham, ON: Markham Historical Society, 1979), pp. 276f; 74f (Milliken family); 339 (post office). See also the detailed 1878 map, \\"Township of Markham,\\" Illustrated historical atlas of the county of York and the township of West Gwillimbury & town of Bradford in the county of Simcoe, Ont. (Toronto: Miles & Co., 1878). The station originally opened on September 7, 1982 on the Stouffville line but was relocated on September 6, 2005 because the curve of the original station made it difficult for the operator to see, and it would allow a parking lot to be built on the other side, along with making the station accessible. The station was re-located south of Steeles Avenue, opposite to the Splendid China Mall shopping centre and accessed by a re-aligned Redlea Avenue. This new station has a straight platform long enough to accommodate a full-length train of ten carriages and a locomotive, which allows the conductor to have a good enough view from the 5th carriage to open all the doors safely. It has a 725 car parking lot, a dedicated passenger pick-up and drop-off area, and a station building with ticket sales counters, a waiting area, and public washrooms. Former location The former Milliken station (closed September 2, 2005), was located on the north side of Steeles in Markham, to the east of Market Village Mall. It consisted of a fenced off area with a small ticket booth and 2 large bus shelters. It was one of the most neglected GO railway stations because it was built on a sharp curve, and was much shorter than most GO stations. Because of that, trains could not open all the doors when stopped there. It had no dedicated parking spots and a small kiss-and-ride area. Cars waiting for the trains were parked at Market Village or along Steeles Avenue. There are no traces of the former platform, other than a single sign facing towards Steeles Avenue reading \\"CN Milliken.\\" From 2018 to 2019 Steeles Avenue will be re routed to allow for the construction of a pedestrian bridge and new level crossing. A small shed was built (in latter 19th Century) by the Toronto and Nipissing Railway as a flag stop located on the north side of Steeles Avenue on the east side of the tracks (see postcards) and used by successor railways (Grand Trunk Railway and Canadian National Railways) until it was demolished in the early 1960s. Connecting transit The station is not directly served by regular local transit services, but there is a short connecting walkway beside the railway tracks to bus stops on Steeles Avenue East.

He is the drummer and backing vocalist for the rock band Coldplay. Early life and education William Raymond Champion was born in Southampton, Hampshire, England, and was brought up in the Highfield suburb of the city, close to the University of Southampton, where his father, Timothy Champion, is a professor of archaeology; his mother, Sara Champion, was also an archaeologist.Chris Martin: ‚ÄòColdplay are saying the opposite of walls and Brexit‚Äô  Music  The Guardian As a youth, Champion's musical influences included Tom Waits, Nick Cave and traditional Irish folk music. He learned to play piano and violin when he was 8 and he learned to play the guitar when he was 12. He also has experience on the bass, and tin whistle. Before he joined Coldplay, Champion performed in a band called Fat Hamster. Champion attended primary school at Portswood Primary School, secondary school at Cantell Maths and Computing College, and college at Peter Symonds College. He attended Highfield Church. As a youngster he also played cricket for Chandler's Ford CC along with his older brother. He studied anthropology at University College London, where he met his future bandmates. English comedian Ricky Gervais is Champion's former boss. Career =Coldplay= Champion was the last of the four band members to join the ensemble on 31 July 1997. He took up the position as drummer with no prior experience, but quickly adjusted to fill the role. In 1999, lead singer Chris Martin sacked Champion, but the band asked him to return soon after. His previous experience on other instruments has been praised by Martin: \\"Will is like a human jukebox. He knows more songs than anyone. You name it, he'll play it.\\" In Coldplay, Champion is often regarded as the rationality of the band. They say of him: \\"Will does have a very sensible head on his shoulders and when it comes to making band decisions he's really good at putting valid points across and keeping everyone focused. He frequently has the casting vote and his decision can sometimes override the consensus!\\" As Chris Martin has said in multiple interviews, \\"We [Coldplay] are all just working for Will Champion.\\" While all four members have sung backing vocals, Champion has been the most prominent. During the Viva la Vida Tour, Champion sang and performed an acoustic version of the song \\"Death Will Never Conquer\\". A version of the song was included on Coldplay's live album LeftRightLeftRightLeft. He has also performed lead vocals on the \\"Life in Technicolor II\\" B-side \\"The Goldrush\\", on a live version of \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" and on the live version of \\"In My Place\\" performed during the A Head Full of Dreams Tour and included in Live in Buenos Aires. =Other projects= In the autumn of 2004, Champion and Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman guested on A-ha keyboardist Magne Furuholmen's first solo album Past Perfect Future Tense. Champion made a cameo appearance in \\"The Rains of Castamere,\\" an episode of the HBO series Game of Thrones, where he portrayed a musician during the Red Wedding. Personal life Champion's mother, Sara, a doctor of prehistoric archaeology, died from cancer in 2000. The album Parachutes was dedicated to her. In 2003, Champion became the first Coldplay member to marry after becoming engaged to Marianne Dark, a teacher. The first child of the couple, a girl named Ava, was born on 28 April 2006. On 7 May 2008, Marianne gave birth to fraternal twins Juno and Rex. Champion is a lifelong fan of Southampton F.C. and has had a season ticket for many years. According to an article released by Quartz in May 2018, Champion has an estimated wealth of ¬£82 million. Equipment Champion currently uses a Yamaha drum kit with Zildjian cymbals. In the music video for \\"Christmas Lights\\", he uses a Slingerland drumkit and Ludwig Supraphonic Snare 14x6.5 inches. For sticks, Champion looks to Pro-Mark's American Hickory 5A stick with a wooden tip. It wasn't until A Head Full Of Dreams Tour (which started in March 2016 and concluded in November 2017) that Champion owned his own drum kit, as all the other drum kits he used were either from the band or from the company.

When the boys try to earn some extra money, the time-traveling immigrants are willing to do the same work for next to nothing, causing the boys to lose their jobs.

Unfamiliar with his surroundings, he is hit lightly by a car. After shovelling snow, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny watch a report on CNN about the mysterious arrival. The mysterious person, who has come from over a thousand years in the future, is looking for work because of the overpopulation and poverty in his time, and he learns that the money that he earns in the 21st century will be enough to feed his family in 3045.

The future people are described by CNN as \\"a hairless, uniform mix of all races\\" with the same skin color, while their language is a guttural mixture of all world languages; also, the immigrants are referred to as \\"Goobacks\\" due to having some kind of goo attached to them after exiting the portal (a satire of the modern slur \\"Wetbacks\\" referring to Mexican immigrants). As the boys return to offer to shovel snow again the next day, they find that the newly arrived time-immigrants have shoveled all driveways on the street for very low pay. As the immigrants are willing to accept jobs for that kind of pay, the original workers throughout South Park are replaced, thus resulting in massive unemployment throughout the town. At a meeting to discuss their concern with the Goobacks, construction worker Darryl Weathers complains that they have worked hard to get their pay high enough to make a living, but now are being ousted by the time-immigrants. The other workers voice their own complaints, with each sentence finishing off with an increasingly slurred and garbled exclamation of \\"They took our jobs!\\", which later becomes their slogan. Later at that meeting, Weathers has the audience suggest ideas for stopping the immigrants from arriving at the town. One man suggests everyone start stripping and engaging in a gay orgy; Weathers likes the idea, as it is the only way to stop the immigrants from coming because homosexual couples cannot spawn offspring. The protesters reluctantly agree with the exception of Jimbo Kern; and begin the orgy. Meanwhile, Stan's father Randy - despite initially being sympathetic to the Goobacks - loses his job to a Gooback and becomes the spokesperson of the protesters. Randy is interviewed by CNN while still naked. Next to him is a very embarrassed and disturbed Stan, who explains that he understands that the immigrants are living in poverty and they are just trying to get by, but realizes that poor societies often hurt other societies instead of helping them. He suggests that the people of the present should try to make the future better so the immigrants will not need to come. The entire town begins to recycle, install solar and wind power devices, plant trees, give to the poor, etc., hoping to cause the Goobacks to disappear. Although the townspeople's efforts are successful and the Goobacks begin to fade away, the boys observe that the work is \\"gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other\\". Stan apologizes, and the male adults including the boys happily resume their orgy. Home release \\"Goobacks\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co- creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.

The school was founded in 1614 with a bequest from William Jones, a successful merchant and trader. The School is run as a trust, the William Jones's Schools Foundation, by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, one of the livery companies, and has close links to its sister school, Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls. In 2018, the Haberdashers renamed their group of schools in the town, the Monmouth Schools, and made corresponding changes to the names of the boys' and girls' schools. The school is situated on the eastern edge of the border town of Monmouth, adjacent to the River Wye. Nothing of the original school buildings from the 17th century remains as the school was completely rebuilt in the mid to late 19th century. Later developments have included the Science Block (1981‚Äì1984) and the William Jones Building of the early 21st century (2014). In 2014, the quatercentenary of the school's foundation was celebrated with a service at St Paul's Cathedral. Established originally as a grammar school, by the early 1870s Monmouth was a member of the recently formed Headmasters' Conference and had acquired the status of a public school. Between 1946 and 1976 it was part of the direct grant scheme, returning to full independence in 1976. A member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, the school has a roll of approximately 650 pupils. The fees for 2019/2020 are ¬£16,275 for day boys, and ¬£30,852 for boarders. The William Jones‚Äôs Schools Foundation, which funds the Monmouth schools on behalf of the Haberdashers‚Äô Company, recorded an income of ¬£24.9M against an expenditure of ¬£23.8M in its accounts for 2018. History William Jones, Haberdasher - The school's founder =Years of foundation: 1613‚Äì1616= In 1613, William Jones, a prominent merchant and haberdasher, gave the Haberdashers‚Äô Company ¬£6,000, followed by a further ¬£3,000 bequeathed in his will on his death in 1615, to \\"ordaine a preacher, a Free-School and Almes-houses for twenty poor and old distressed people, as blind and lame, as it shall seem best to them, of the Towne of Monmouth, where it shall be bestowed\\". Jones was born at Newland, Gloucestershire and brought up in Monmouth, leaving to make a sizeable fortune as a London merchant engaged in the cloth trade with the continent. The motivations for his bequest appear partly philanthropic and partly evangelical; the county of Monmouthshire in the early 17th century had a significant Catholic presence and the local historian Keith Kissack noted, \\"the priority given to the preacher illustrates [Jones's] concern to convert an area in the Marches which was still, when the school opened in 1614, strongly recusant\\". The order for the establishment of the school was made, retrospectively by James I in 1616 and decreed \\"for ever in the town of Monmouth, one almshouse and one free grammar school\\". The Haberdashers purchased four fields as the site for the school before Jones's death, paying the sum of ¬£100. Royal permission for this charitable purchase was required under the Statute of Mortmain, which was granted in 1614. By Jones's death in Hamburg in 1615, the almshouses, and the schoolroom and headmaster's house had been completed, although nothing now remains of the original school buildings. The bulk of Jones's considerable bequest was used for the purchase of lands at New Cross, in South-East London, and the rent rolls from that estate provided the money for the salaries and running costs associated with the school, as well as the payment of pensions to the residents of the almshouses. The first headmaster was John Owen, M.A. of Queens' College, Cambridge, appointed on a salary of ¬£60 per annum. Neither Owen, nor many of his 17th and 18th century successors, lasted very long unlike the school day which ran from 7‚Äì11 a.m., followed by an afternoon session from 1.30‚Äì5.00 p.m. =Years of uncertainty: 1617‚Äì1799= The 17th century school buildings The mid-twentieth-century historian of the school, H. A. Ward, described its early history as \\"the precarious years\\". Continuing religious controversy, coupled with the English Civil War, made the town of Monmouth a divided and uncertain setting for the school. Divisions between staff, and the financial instability, and remoteness, of the Haberdashers Company, which was compelled to make substantial loans to the Parliamentary government that went unpaid for decades, and was then required to finance the rebuilding of their livery hall which was destroyed during the Great Fire of London, contributed to internal weaknesses. These difficulties continued well into the 18th century, and at one point, during the headship of the \\"morose and tyrannical\\" John Crowe, who was removed from his post after becoming insane, the school roll fell to just three boys. A source for information regarding the school in the mid-17th century is the diary of the school's usher, More Pye. The diary, extracts from which were published in the Monmouthshire Beacon in 1859 but which is now lost, records Pye's experiences in great detail from the date of his appointment in 1646 until his resignation in 1652. An example is Pye's entry for February 18, 1647; \\"Pd (paid) 6d ffor (for) wormeseedes and triacle for ye boys\\". A less parochial entry for November 11, 1647, records Pye's monarchist sympathies, \\"Ye King's Magy (Majesty) made an escape from Hampton Court, out of ye Armye's power. Vivat, vivat in aeternum\\". =Years of controversy: 1800‚Äì1850= Ward described the early 19th century period of the school's history as years of \\"controversy\\". These focused mainly on three issues; relations between the school and the town, relations between the school, the town and the Haberdashers Company and the Court of Chancery, which together were responsible for the school's funding and oversight, and attempts to expand the school's curriculum beyond the traditional study of Latin and Greek. The first issue saw the school perceived as part of the faction of the Dukes of Beaufort, the premier landowners in the county, and directors of the town's politics from their regional base at Troy House. Early 19th century Monmouth had a strong Radical tradition led by burgesses such as Thomas Thackwell, and fuelled by the liberal positions of the local newspapers, the Monmouthshire Beacon and the Monmouthshire Merlin. The school's leadership was perceived in the town to be too close to the Beauforts, and Thackwell ran an almost fifty-year campaign against their attempts to defend the established order. The second controversy related to the governance of the school and another long campaign of attrition saw the school's Lecturer lose the responsibility for preparing an annual report on the school, this being transferred by the Court of Chancery to a Board of Visitors. The last area of conflict arose between the school's leadership, which wanted to maintain the tradition of a curriculum that involved the study solely of Latin and Greek, and the Court and the Haberdashers who wanted expansion to cover such areas as writing and arithmetic. In a damming report in 1827 they condemned \\"the present Masters, though so liberally paid, and having so little to do, consider themselves engaged only to teach Latin and Greek. A school teaching those branches of learning only will never be useful to a place of such confined population as Monmouth\\". Reforms introduced by John Oakley Hill in 1852, saw the establishment of Upper and Lower Schools, the former continuing to provide a classical education, while the latter had a curriculum focused on writing and arithmetic. William Coxe, who undertook extensive tours of Wales in the very late 18th and early 19th centuries in the company of his friend, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, recorded his impressions of the school in the second volume of his An Historical tour in Monmouthshire, published in 1801. Describing the school as enjoying \\"a high reputation under the care of (the headmaster) the Rev. John Powell\\", Coxe retells the mythical story of the school's establishment and records a \\"portrait of the founder, habited in the costume of the age of James the First, with an inscription 'Walter William Jones, haberdasher and merchant of London etc.' is preserved in the school room\\". =Years of expansion: 1851‚Äì1913= In the early 1850s the Court of Chancery insisted on the appointment of an external examiner. His report of 1852 was not encouraging; \\"many of the boys appear so ignorant as to be a disgrace to their parents, still more than to their teachers\\". If the academic outlook remained bleak, the financial position of the school was transformed in this period. The sale of part of the New Cross estate to railway developers, and the vastly increased rents accruing from the development and expansion of London saw the Haberdashers' fortunes dramatically increase. The availability of funds led to the complete rebuilding of the school on its original site between 1864, the school's 250th anniversary, and the end of the century. The school's expansion was undertaken during the long reign of the Rev. Charles Manley Roberts, headmaster for 32 years from 1859 to 1892. During Roberts's time Monmouth became an early member of the prestigious Headmaster's Conference (created by Edward Thring of Uppingham in 1869), a mark of its increasing reputation and status as a public school. The school's reputation for sporting prowess also rose, its rugby teams and rowers enjoying particular success. As a result of rising revenues from rents and investments, by the mid-19th century, Monmouth's endowment was one of largest of any school in England and Wales. To use the resulting surpluses, the original foundation was reorganised in 1891 to support a new girls‚Äô school and an elementary school in the town, as well as a boys' grammar school (West Monmouth School) in Pontypool. As importantly for the school's development, the rule that limited applications to boys from Monmouthshire and the neighbouring counties was set aside, and applications were opened to the entirety of Wales and England. =Years of war: 1914‚Äì1945= The school close with the memorial sundial to G. H. Sutherland, Head of School, who drowned in the River Wye in 1921 Monmouth School's Combined Cadet Force was reportedly the last CCF in the country to change its uniforms to khaki from the traditional blue at the outbreak of war in August 1914. The conflict brought the award of the school's only Victoria Cross, to Angus Buchanan in 1916 for conspicuous bravery in the Mesopotamian campaign. Blinded by a bullet to the head the following year, he returned to Monmouthshire and worked as a solicitor in Coleford, unveiling the school's war memorial in 1921. In total, seventy-six old boys from the school were killed in the war. The school's Bricknell Library, founded in 1921, commemorated one of them, Ernest Thomas Samuel Bricknell, who died in October 1916 from wounds received at the Battle of the Somme. Further loss of life occurred in 1921, when the Head of School, G. H. Sutherland, drowned in the Wye during a rowing match between the school and Hereford Cathedral School. Sutherland is commemorated by the sundial in the school's cloister. The Second World War added the names of a further sixty-one Old Monmothians to the lists of the dead inscribed on the school's war memorial. During the war, the school hosted the entire school and staff from King Edward VI Five Ways School, Birmingham, who were evacuated due to German bombing of the Midlands. =Recent years: 1946‚Äìpresent= Internal conflict within the school's management continued in the mid-twentieth century, with the governors sacking two headmasters within three years. This led to the school's expulsion from the Headmasters Conference, and to that body's advising any of its members against applying for the vacant headship. The impasse was resolved in 1959, with the appointment of Robert Glover. Reorganisation of the Haberdashers' endowments also occurred at this time. The elementary school, founded with Haberdashers' funds in 1891, was transferred to County Council control in 1940 with West Monmouth School at Pontypool following in 1955. This left the William Jones's Schools Foundation responsible for Monmouth School and Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls ‚Äì also known as HMSG ‚Äì both of which joined the Direct Grant scheme in 1946. Another significant development for the school's location was the building of the A40, which \\"severed (Monmouth) ruthlessly from the river on which in the past it had depended\\" and cut off the school from its historic frontage onto the River Wye. This led to the permanent closure of the school's ceremonial entrance, the Wye Bridge Gate, constructed by Henry Stock in the 1890s. The direct impact on the school was perhaps less significant, Ward had recorded an early comment on the entrance, \\"that ancient gate which never opened is but thrice a year on notable occasions, such as when the coal cart comes\\". In 1976, with the ending of the Direct Grant system, the school returned to full independence. Having argued strongly against the ending of the grant system, the headmaster at the time, Robert Glover, gave a warning as to the likely consequences, \\"if direct grant goes, the school which has served the boys of Monmouth for four hundred years, will suddenly become for many families financially prohibitive\\". In response, a committee of the Old Monmothian Club, headed by Lord Brecon and Sir Derek Ezra undertook a campaign to raise funding for scholarships which accumulated ¬£100,000 in ten weeks. During his tenure Glover also secured re-admittance to the Headmasters' Conference. To mark the school's four hundredth anniversary a service of thanksgiving was held at St. Paul's Cathedral, on 19 March 2014, attended by some 2,200 pupils and staff from the school and from Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, as well as Haberdashers and friends of the Schools. In 2018, the Haberdashers rebranded their group of schools in the town as Haberdashers Monmouth Schools and renamed the senior schools as Monmouth School for Boys and Monmouth School for Girls respectively. In its most recent accounts, published in 2018, the William Jones‚Äôs Schools Foundation, which funds the Monmouth group of schools on behalf of the Haberdahers‚Äô Company, recorded an expenditure of ¬£23.8M against an income of ¬£24.9M. Histories of the school The Monmouthshire antiquarian Charles Heath described the traditional, and almost certainly inaccurate, story of the school's foundation in his Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of the Town of Monmouth, published in 1804. Heath records that William Jones, now established as a successful and wealthy merchant, returned to his home town of Newland disguised as a beggar. Receiving a hostile reception, he travelled to Monmouth, where he was more warmly received and where, as a consequence, he funded the construction of the school and associated almshouses. The story is taken from an earlier oral tradition, also recorded in Archdeacon Coxe's An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire, published three years before. In 1899, the Rev. W. M. Warlow published his History of the Charities of William Jones at Monmouth and Newland. His fellow cleric and master, the Rev. K. M. Pitt wrote a more focused account, Monmouth School in the 1860s. H. A. Ward published Monmouth School: 1614‚Äì1964: An Outline History to commemorate the school's 350th anniversary. In 1995, Keith Kissack published his history, Monmouth School and Monmouth: 1614‚Äì1995. In 2014, in celebration of the school's quatercentenary, two masters at the school, Stephen Edwards, who wrote the text, and Keith Moseley, who took the photographs, published a new history, Monmouth School: The First 400 Years. Buildings Interior of Monmouth School Chapel, 1865 William Jones's original foundation provided for a schoolroom, on the site of the present chapel, houses for the Headmaster and Lecturer, and almshouses segregated by sex. A painting by J.A. Evans, of later date and purchased on behalf of the school by the then Headmaster Lionel James in 1921, shows the buildings and is titled The Old School Room. Built A.D. 1614. Pulled down to make room for the present school room, 1865. Nothing of these buildings remains. The local writer and artist Fred Hando records that the bell, which hung above the schoolroom, was cast at the Evan Evans foundry at Chepstow in 1716. In 1864 the Haberdashers undertook a substantial rebuilding of the school. Funded by the rising fortunes of Jones's bequest on the back of the Victorian expansion of London, the work was mostly undertaken by William Snooke and Henry Stock, of the firm Snooke & Stock, surveyors to the Haberdashers' Company. Snooke built the chapel, two schoolrooms and a classroom in 1864‚Äì1865, followed in the 1870s by the library, Headmaster's House and the buildings which now form Monmouth House and Hereford House. These buildings are all Grade II listed. The Monmouth Alms Houses, on Almshouse Street, were rebuilt by J. B. Bunning in 1842, and redeveloped by William Burn in 1895‚Äì1896. They now form part of the school and incorporate a large inscription panel describing the benefactions of the Jones Foundation. The almshouses are also Grade II listed. The chapel was further extended in 1875. Snooke's work was not universally praised; a report from the School's Commissioner commenting, \\"the architect has arranged the buildings in a most inconvenient manner, and the ventilation is deficient.\\" School House, with its ceremonial arched entrance and coat of arms facing the Wye Bridge, and the adjacent technology block, were designed by Henry Stock in 1894‚Äì1895. They are Grade II listed buildings as of 8 October 2005. The style of the School House block mirrors that of the main block of Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, which Stock designed at the same time. The war memorial was dedicated in 1921, Angus Buchanan (VC) attending the ceremony. The memorial is a Grade II listed structure. To the west of Stock's School House block, and set into the wall previously facing the Wye and now completely overshadowed by the A40 by-pass, is a pair of iron gates, of 18th century date and installed at the school in 1941. They come from the Haberdashers' Hall in London which was destroyed during the Blitz. The school's building of greatest architectural merit is the Grade II* listed Chapel House. The architectural historian John Newman describes the 18th century building, situated on the Hereford Road away from the main school site, as \\"the best house in the entire street\\". More modern developments include the Hall of 1961, redeveloped in the early 21st century and now the Blake Theatre, the Red Lion Block of the same date and the Science Block of 1981‚Äì1984. In 1985‚Äì1986, two ceramic murals were designed for the chapel by the Polish religious artist Adam Kossowski, a friend and wartime colleague of the school's Head of Art from 1947‚Äì1978, Otto Maciag. Executed by Maciag, and another art master at the school, Michael Tovey, the murals were dedicated at a service conducted by the Bishop of Monmouth, the Rt Rev Clifford Wright on 3 October 1987. He described them as \\"masterpieces of twentieth-century religious art‚Äù. In November 2008, a ¬£2.3 million sports pavilion was completed and opened by the former British Lions player and Welsh captain, Eddie Butler, an old boy of the School. It was designed by the architects Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams. In 2011 the school began the Heart Project. This led to the sale of some outlying sites, such as St. James's House, and the re-organisation of others, to assist in the raising of funds for the redevelopment of the main school site. Further funds came from the Haberdashers' Company, and the first phase was completed with the rebuilding of the Red Lion Block, now renamed the William Jones Building. The school today The William Jones Building With 650 pupils, the school offers boarding and day places as well as preparatory departments in a single-sex environment. A range of GCSE, A and AS level subjects are offered, with the Sixth Form having some collaborative teaching with pupils from the sister school, Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls (HMSG). Tatler magazine's 2020 Schools Guide noted its strong academic performance. The school charges fees for attendance; for 2019-2020, the annual fees are: day pupils, ¬£16,275, boarding pupils, ¬£30,852. The school operates a substantial bursary programme. In September 2018, Monmouth School was renamed Monmouth School for Boys after a merger of all five Haberdashers' Company schools in Monmouth. The Foundation now operates under the name Haberdashers' Monmouth Schools and consists of: Monmouth School for Boys (formerly Monmouth School), Monmouth School for Girls (formerly Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls or HMSG), Monmouth School Boys' Prep (formerly The Grange), Monmouth School Girls' Prep (formerly Inglefield House) and Monmouth Schools Pre-Prep and Nursery (formerly Agincourt School). =Houses= There are three age divisions in the school; lower (forms I and II) middle (forms III, IV, and V) and sixth form (forms VI.1 and VI.2). Within these divisions, the school operates a House system. As at 2018, the houses are: * Wye and Dean Houses, the lower school day houses; * Severn House, Town House, Monmouth House and Hereford House, middle school day houses; * New House, Weirhead House, School House and Chapel House, middle school boarding houses; * Tudor, Glendower and Buchanan Houses, which comprise the sixth form centre and VI.2 boarding. =Extracurricular activities= The school has its own theatre, The Blake, opened in 2004. Funded by Bob Blake, a former pupil, it is used as a venue for performances by both the school and the girls' school, and by external performers. The Glover Music School has an auditorium and teaching and practice rooms. The strong musical tradition owes much to Michael Eveleigh, director of music at the school from 1950‚Äì1986, and his successors, there having been only five directors of music since the Second World War. Other extra-curricular activities include foreign expeditions, music and drama events as well as a newspaper, The Lion, a creative writing leaflet, The Lion's Tale, The Mon-Mouth, a bi-weekly, student-run newspaper and an annual magazine, The Monmothian, first published in 1882. The Combined Cadet Force, founded in 1904, which has both Army and RAF sections, is operated in collaboration with HMSG. =Sport= The school has a notable sporting tradition, with a high number of successful sportsmen amongst its alumni. The main sports are rugby, rowing and cricket. The school's rowing club, affiliated to British Rowing (boat code MNS), produced three championship crews at the 1988, 2007 and 2009 British Rowing Championships. Facilities include a boathouse, a sports complex which houses a six-lane swimming pool, indoor facilities including a weights and fitness suite, tennis courts, and a full size astroturf pitch. The Hitchcock sports pavilion, completed in 2008, stands on the playing fields, on the other side of the Wye from the school's main site.

Thought to contain only one species, in 1994 it was recognized to have two; P. elata and P. filaris, both of which are among the fastest growing palms. Description These dioecious palms have green, solitary trunks with widely spaced leaf scar rings. The trunks grow to 45 cm in diameter and 35 m in height; the leaf crown is hemispherical, or nearly so, with 6 m pinnate leaves on robust, 2 m petioles. Petioles are armed with 6 cm spines, gold or gray in color. Inflorescences emerge from within the leaf crown, to 2 m in length, and resemble those in Mauritia. The fruit ripens to a yellow-orange drupe, covered in scales and containing one seed.

Army of Karelia was formed on 29 June 1941 soon after the start of the Continuation War.  Organisation  The army was organised in two corps and one separate group. * VII Corps (VII armeijakunta) * VI Corps (VI armeijakunta) * Group Oinonen or Group O (Ryhm√§ Oinonen or Ryhm√§ O) The corps consisted of a total of 5 infantry divisions. The Cavalry Brigade and the 1st and 2nd J√§ger Brigades were organised into Group O. Also, the German 163rd Infantry Division was later added to the army.  Offensive  The areas occupied by Finnish troops during the Continuation War. The Karelian Army fought north of Lake Ladoga. On July 10 the Army started its offensive against East Karelia, north of Lake Ladoga. The aim was to reclaim the areas lost to the Soviet Union in the Winter War, but also to advance deeper into Soviet territory to gain a more easily defensible front. On the north flank the army was supported by the independent 14th Division and to the south by forces on the Karelian Isthmus. The army's advance was rapid due to the use of light j√§ger troops. The capital of Karelia Petrozavodsk was taken in October and promptly renamed to the poetic √Ñ√§nislinna. By September 1941, Army of Karelia participated in the Siege of Leningrad, threatening the city from the east. During the autumn of 1941 the army took positions along the river Svir between lakes Ladoga and Onega. Medvezhegorsk was taken in December. After the offensive phase of the war ended, Army of Karelia was disbanded and its HQ became HQ of Aunus Group.

Mark, an original regular character when the series started in February 1985, became a semi-regular after his original portrayer David Scarboro was written out of the role in April 1985. Scarboro made brief returns to the role in 1986 and 1987. Scarboro committed suicide in April 1988 and his body was found at the bottom of Beachy Head, East Sussex. Mark was recast in 1990, with former Grange Hill regular Todd Carty taking on the role. From this point the character was a permanent fixture in the series and Carty remained in the role until the character was written out of the series in early 2003. Initially a delinquent teenager, he became a changed man when he returned to Albert Square as a 22-year-old in 1990. Following his return, Mark was featured in some of the most prominent storylines during his tenure on the soap. He announced that he had been diagnosed with HIV, which forced him to grow up fast and accept his responsibilities. He frequently found it difficult to accept the restrictions of the illness, which finally caused his death in April 2004. Other storylines included marriages to Gill Fowler (Susanna Dawson), who had also contracted HIV and died the day after their wedding, Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson), which ended in adultery, and Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin), arguably the most problematic of them all. Storylines =1985‚Äì1987= Mark is first of three children born to Albert Square residents Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) and his wife Pauline (Wendy Richard). Initially, a teenage Mark gets involved in drugs with local thug Nick Cotton (John Altman), attempts to join a racist organisation known as The New Movement, is a suspect in Reg Cox's (Johnnie Clayton) murder, and generally clashes with his parents. With no solution to these problems in sight, he abruptly leaves home without telling anyone. He is not seen again until eight months later when he contacts his parents through a runaways' agency and Pauline and Arthur find him in Southend-on-Sea. Mark is living with an older Swedish woman named Ingrid (Sally Faulkner) and her two children, John (Anthony Short) and Melanie (Vanessa Short), who call Mark \\"Daddy\\". He and Ingrid split up soon afterwards and Mark moves around the country. Mark returns to Walford several times for brief visits. In July, he brings his Welsh friend Owen Hughes (Philip Brock). The duo cause problems after Cassie Carpenter (Delanie Forbes) steals their cannabis and her parents, Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) and Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe), catch her smoking it; the Carpenters refuse to speak to the Fowlers for some time afterwards. In November, Pauline receives news that Mark is in Borstal detention centre for drug offences, burglary, and assaulting a policeman. Visiting him, Pauline finds him unrepentant but due for release in a few weeks. After his release he briefly returns to Walford, but refuses to stay despite Pauline's pleas. He is not seen again until Christmas the same year, when he visits unexpectedly to spend the day with his family. Mark astutely guesses that Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) is his niece's father but keeps this to himself. This is the last time Mark is seen for over two years. =1990‚Äì2003= Mark returns to Albert Square in September 1990 as a changed man. He is more caring and stable, having grown out of his rebellious stage. His new maturity is due to the fact that he has contracted HIV, which has forced him to become more responsible. Mark develops a close friendship with Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence) and initially doesn't tell anyone about his HIV status. But as he and Diane grow closer, he finally tells her the truth. He believes that he contracted the virus from Gill Robinson (Susanna Dawson), his girlfriend in Newcastle, who visits briefly later that year but leaves when she sees him kissing Diane. Mark initially tells Gill that he isn't infected but later tells the truth. Mark's relationship with Diane never becomes serious but she is a good friend and confidante and persuades Mark to have counselling at the Terrence Higgins Trust. Mark initially turns on his male counsellor, relaying his bitterness at being a potential AIDS victim, but later feels the benefits of the counselling. Mark loves Diane for keeping his secret and he asks her to marry him but she gently refuses and leaves Walford to live in France. Later that year, following the example of a friend Joe Wallace (Jason Rush) who had told his parents about being gay and HIV- positive, Mark decides to tell his parents. By now, he is dating Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), who advises him not to but Mark is tired of the pretence. On Boxing Day Mark tells Pauline and Arthur that he is HIV-positive. They sit in stunned silence while he scatters helpful leaflets around the house and then goes away for a while. On his return, he faces Pauline's irrational terror and Arthur's hostility. Arthur's ignorance is apparent initially as he fears that Mark will pass HIV on to him; he even bleaches everything Mark touches to avoid infection. Pauline and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) are understandably distraught but help Arthur to understand the illness, and are a huge support to Mark. Mark's relationship with Rachel ends, and the animosity at home sends Mark back to his girlfriend Gill, who moves to London and becomes seriously ill. Gill's HIV has already progressed into AIDS and her deterioration is rapid. She is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and goes into a hospice. Mark realises that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him. Mark and Gill marry, and their honeymoon consists of one night in a hotel, before Gill returns to the hospice and dies. Mark later befriends local teenage tearaway Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) but their friendship is severely tested when she becomes obsessed with him. Mark, still grieving for Gill, is horrified when he discovers that Mandy has been reading his late wife's diary and has dressed up in her clothes. Despite this, he invites Mandy to live with him after Den's friend Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) throws her out. On Christmas Day, Mandy goes to visit her mother but is attacked by her stepfather; Mark arrives just in time to rescue her and invites her for Christmas dinner at the Fowler household. Mark takes over running the family fruit and vegetable stall in the market after his uncle, Pete Beale (Peter Dean), leaves. He also begins casually dating his sister's housemate Shelley Lewis (Nicole Arumugam), but is reluctant to tell her about his HIV status. Whilst on a trip to Amsterdam, Shelley makes it clear to Mark that she wants to sleep with him, forcing him to admit his HIV status. Shelley is furious that he did not think to tell her this before and tells him she never wants to see him again. Mark takes the rejection badly and stops taking his HIV medication. During Christmas that year, he is rushed to hospital after collapsing. Mandy visits him in hospital and learns that he has HIV. When Shelley finds out that Mark is ill, she returns and admits that she really cares for him and they reconcile. However, Shelley tries to rush things by asking Mark to meet her family and go on holiday with her parents. She becomes infatuated and tries to spend as much time with him as she can. Mark fears that the relationship is moving too quickly and Mark decides to end it. When he tries to tell Shelley this, she uses emotional blackmail to stop him, saying that she has risked her health being with him so he owes her. When this doesn't work, she threatens to tell everyone about his HIV status, but leaves Walford when her bluff doesn't work. Following Joe's death of an AIDS-related illness, Mark meets a Scottish woman named Ruth Aitken (Caroline Paterson), who is also visiting a friend. After a brief conversation, the two decide to go for a drink together. They start dating and Ruth copes with his HIV status but her father, a strict Presbyterian minister, refuses to give his blessing to her relationship with Mark and disowns her when she announces her plans to marry Mark. They marry in Scotland but problems surface in their marriage. She persuades Mark - and herself - that she is happy about not having children (due to the inevitable spread of the AIDS virus to herself and the baby), but it is soon clear that she is fooling herself. Mark is injured in a pub brawl during which he saved the square's local hardman, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), from getting glassed by a punter. However, after calling the ambulance, Grant overhears Ruth telling the paramedics about Mark's HIV status. Around this time, Mark wins money at an illegal poker match that takes place at the Bridge Street Cafe run by Steve Elliot (Mark Monero) and gives the money to Arthur. However, Arthur is arrested and asked where he got the money. Mark tells the police but he needs a witness. He asks Steve to help, but Steve is not willing to help due to fear of repercussions with the two gangsters who organised the game. Arthur spends a stretch in prison, leaving Mark devastated. Steve eventually decides to help but leaves Albert Square when he is threatened by the criminal firm. Arthur is eventually released. To add to his problems, Mark is further devastated when Arthur dies of a brain haemorrhage in May 1996, after being injured in a prison riot several weeks earlier and the Fowlers are in mourning. During this time, Mark's HIV issues escalates when Kathy's infant child Ben (Matthew Silver) becomes seriously ill, and Grant informs his brother Phil (Steve McFadden) - the child's father - about the situation. Grant blackmails Ruth, telling her that she has until Arthur's funeral to give up babysitting Ben or he will tell the whole square about Mark. Phil and Kathy soon learn about Mark's condition, which causes Ruth to lose her job as a child minder. Mark confronts Grant after learning he blackmailed Ruth about his HIV status but Grant reassures Mark that he won't tell anyone else. On the day of his father's funeral, Mark becomes angry that Willy Roper (Michael Tudor-Barnes) had framed Arthur for embezzlement and assaults Willy at the cemetery. He believes that he was the one who caused Arthur's death. Mark's HIV status becomes public knowledge after an argument in the Queen Victoria between Pauline and Ted Hills (Brian Croucher) is overheard by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). She hears Ted tell Pauline that he knows that Mark has AIDS. Peggy spreads the gossip around the Square and the residents begin to boycott Mark's fruit and vegetable stall, fearing they will catch the virus, showing their ignorance on their knowledge of HIV or AIDS. Pauline springs to her son's defence and she and Peggy have a vicious fight, but even Pauline cannot defuse the prejudice, and Mark comes home to find the words \\"AIDS scum\\" graffitied on his wall. This is too much and he decides to present his neighbours with a few facts about his illness in The Queen Victoria; firstly by telling them that he does not have AIDS but is HIV positive, which is a non-contagious virus, forcing them to acknowledge their bigotry. Grant speaks to Mark the next day and tells him that no one is barred from The Queen Victoria unless he says so. Peggy remains uncertain, but is forced to realise that Mark might appreciate some support when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. Mark and Ruth foster a six-year-old girl named Jessie Moore (Chelsey Paden), but returning her to her mother proves too heartbreaking and their marriage goes into crisis. When Mark's cousin Conor Flaherty (Se√°n Gleeson) shows an interest in Ruth, Mark becomes jealous and the relationship falls apart. After they split, Ruth succumbs to Conor's charms and becomes pregnant by him. She leaves Walford with Conor, leaving Mark heartbroken. In 2000, Mark's past troubles resurface when Nick returns to the square and the two embark on a longstanding feud. This soon gets Mark's younger brother, Martin (James Alexandrou), involved when Nick attempts to ensnare him with drugs - as he once did with Mark. Towards the end of the year, Nick gets one over Mark after giving Martin ecstasy. When Mark discovers this, he decides to settle the score with his tormentor once and for all. Mark spikes Nick's drink, leads him up to the Walford viaduct, and watches delightedly as the intoxicated Nick falls - just as midnight strikes and 2001 commences. Nick survives the fall, but is left severely crippled and vows revenge against Mark. He enlists his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald), who had recently befriended Martin, to take revenge on Mark. However, when Ashley is hesitant to kill Mark himself, Nick takes matters into his own hands and drains the brake fluid on his motorbike. The next day, Ashley - not knowing that his father had done - steals Mark's motorbike and attempts to run him over in a last-ditch attempt to impress his father, but is killed after he ends up crashing into the launderette. On the eve of Ashley's funeral, Mark and Nick have their final showdown when Nick attempts to kill Mark with a knife. Mark overpowers Nick, who then blurts out that he should've been the one on the motorbike instead of Ashley - thus exposing his involvement in his son's death. Mark berates Nick for causing his own son's death, then leaves him to be disowned by his mother Dot (June Brown) - who had just overheard Nick confess to his role in Ashley's death. At the end of Ashley's funeral, Mark watches as Nick leaves the square shortly afterwards and mutters to himself \\"Some people you're just glad to see the back of\\"; their rivalry is brought to an end as Nick leaves the square and never sees Mark again. By 2001, Nick wasn't the only enemy Mark had been clashing with throughout the year. He embarked on a conflict with Phil after learning that he had been mistreating his girlfriend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), whom Mark has been growing fond of from that point. Mark soon takes Lisa to live with him after she leaves Phil, and they start dating - much to Pauline's horror. Mark also defends Kathy's son Ian (Adam Woodyatt) from Phil on several occasions, particularly when Mark witnesses Phil attacking Ian and is forced to separate them. When Phil is shot on the night his nemesis Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Lisa's best friend Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) get married, Mark becomes a prime suspect as the police gather information on his hatred for Phil - which leads his godson Jamie (Jack Ryder) and cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) to each separately accuse Mark of shooting Phil. One month later, Mark learns that Phil has recovered and checked himself out of the hospital to exact revenge - prompting him to find Lisa in order to protect her from Phil. When he finds them at her house, Mark learns from Phil that it was Lisa who shot him. Lisa confesses to shooting Phil. Despite this, Mark continues to defend Lisa and tells Phil that she isn't totally responsible for the crime - stating that the abuse Phil had inflicted upon Lisa is what set the course of his shooting in the first place. Phil grudgingly comes to accept these terms, and decides to cover Lisa's involvement by framing his ex- business partner Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for the crime. Mark and Lisa observe Phil planning to incriminate Dan in the shooting, even going as far as to get Steve and Mel involved with his plan. However, Dan is found not guilty and he takes revenge on Phil and Steve by kidnapping Mel and fleeing the country with a money ransom - all the while believing that Steve had shot Phil, meaning that Dan was never aware that Lisa had shot Phil in the first place. At the point Phil's actions have resulted in Dan fleeing the country and Steve's marriage with Mel were left on the verge of facing jeopardy, Mark and Lisa conduct a plan to pretend that she is expecting Mark's baby - as he had grown to love Lisa so much ever since her troubles with Phil had started. To facilitate their lie, Mark insists that he'd taken all necessary precautions in relation to his HIV and they fool everyone for a while. He later proposes to Lisa shortly after her baby Louise is born. However, Mark is devastated to learn that Phil is actually the child's biological father. This Phil discovers when Grant's former wife Sharon (Letitia Dean) informs him about Louise's true parentage, and Phil vows to take an active role in his daughter's upbringing. Mark and Lisa marry, but their happiness is short- lived: Lisa is still very much in love with Phil and Phil knows it so he seduces her in order to get more access to Louise. After Sharon discovers Phil's intentions, she talks him out of his plan and he ends the affair with Lisa, but Mark finds out and after just five months of marriage Lisa leaves Mark and resumes her affair with Phil. This causes Mark to break down by the time he eventually discovers this. After confronting Phil about the discovery, Mark almost rapes Lisa. Horrified by his actions, Mark leaves Walford for a short while. However, Lisa soon realizes her mistake living with Phil and wants to reconcile with Mark, but Pauline refuses to tell her where Mark has gone. Mark eventually returns at Christmas. In January 2003, Mark's doctor tells him that his body is rejecting the medication that will prolong his life and slow down the onset of AIDS. Accepting that he will not live for much longer, he decides to leave rather than let his family see him endure a slow, painful death. On 14 February 2003, he makes a tearful farewell to his family and friends and rides off on his motorbike, although he remains in contact with family. In April 2004, Martin receives a telephone call from Mark's nurse, informing him that Mark has died from an AIDS-related form of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. His body is returned to Walford and he is given a heart- felt send-off by the residents. Following his death, Mark would be referenced by his own family and friends during the subsequent years that go on in the square; particularly in 2015 when Nick returns and, after recalling Dot about the time he tried to kill Mark, ultimately dies from a drug overdose.  Creation and development  =Introduction (1985)= Mark Fowler was one of the original 23 characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mark was a member of the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers, and Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Mark's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. Several young actors were seen and read for the part of Mark (including Gary Hailes, who would later play the gay barrow boy, Barry Clark). On paper, David Scarboro was the least likely to get the job as he was relatively inexperienced, having previously only appeared in a little-known made-for-television film and Grange Hill. His reading was not a huge success as he mumbled most of his lines. However, Holland and Smith were taken with his appearance, particularly his \\"piercing eyes\\", which reminded them of James Dean. They felt that he would be \\"dynamite on-screen\\", and his likeness to their vision of the character was uncanny, so they offered him the role. Mark was originally scripted to be a wayward delinquent and was due to feature heavily within the first year of the series. However, as soon as the regular gruelling schedule of EastEnders production established itself, it became clear that Scarboro was not happy in the role. The stress of the heavy workload and the sudden fame that came to all the actors became difficult for him to cope with. He became unhappy with the schedule and his scripts and refused to play Mark as a racist as was intended. Holland and Smith decided to write the character out of the show to allow the actor to come to terms with the situation better. On-screen, Mark was being implicated in the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton) and was being tempted into heroin by Nick Cotton (John Altman). =Initial departure and brief returns= Fearing Nick Cotton and the police, Mark ran away from home in April 1985. As this had not been the original plan for the character, it meant a hectic period of re-writing early in 1985. The first 50+ scripts were reworked to accommodate this major change. Many of the stories intended for Mark were subsequently given to Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Mark's sister Michelle (Susan Tully) - which partially explains why her character became so prominent in the first year. It still left a gap though, because several of Mark's functions in the serial, as slightly the eldest of the youngsters, could not have been taken over by the others. A new character needed to be introduced to restore the balance to its original shape, which is why the character of Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) was introduced later in 1985. This meant introducing the audience to a character and a story approximately a year before it had been originally intended - \\"Wicksy\\" had originally been scheduled to join the series around the same time as his mother Pat, who arrived in June 1986. Scarboro returned to the show briefly in December 1985 in a storyline that saw Mark's parents, Pauline (Wendy Richard) and Arthur (Bill Treacher) search for him in Southend. The storyline's intention was to help highlight the problems some parents face when their teenage children disappear from home. He returned again for brief stints in 1986 and 1987. His final appearance as Mark was on Christmas Day 1987. =Return and recast (1990)= Scarboro was never to make a return due to his suicide in April 1988. However, BBC bosses decided not to kill off the character, and later set out to find a new actor to reprise the role. Subsequently, the role was recast in 1990 to actor Todd Carty, renowned for his role as Tucker Jenkins in Grange Hill. At this time, Mark returned to the series as a permanent character. Carty later reported that he enjoyed playing Mark because it gave him \\"good dramatic stuff to get his teeth into.\\" The most notable storyline involving Mark after his return to Albert Square was the revelation that he had contracted HIV. Mark discovered he was HIV positive in 1991, and informed his family of this on Boxing Day that year. There then followed a traumatic journey as he struggled first to come to terms with the news, then track down his previous partners to inform them that he was infected with the virus. The problems didn't end there, however, as Mark then had to battle with the fear and ignorance of those living around him - including his parents. Many of Albert Square's residents initially rejected him when they found out that he was HIV positive. Mark married one of his ex- partners Gill (Susanna Dawson), who had also been infected with the virus but in her case it had progressed to AIDS, and she subsequently died the day after the wedding in 1992. The episode in which Gill died (written by Debbie Cook and directed by Leonard Lewis) has been chosen by writer Colin Brake as one of the most memorable episodes of 1992. In his book, EastEnders: The First Ten Years Blake comments, \\"Although in many ways the episode was sad and downbeat it was not without its positive aspects, as Mark talked to his sister about his own mortality.\\" Susanna Dawson, the actress who played Gill, found the experience of playing a person living with, and dying from, AIDS so intense that she co-produced an educational video based on the subject for use in schools and wrote a book, The Gill and Mark Story, to accompany it. =HIV/AIDS= Mark became the first mainstream soap character to be diagnosed as HIV-positive. The storyline came after a government request to \\"spread the word\\".\\"Policy makers stake a claim to TV soapbox\\", Scotsman. URL last accessed on 2006-10-16. Mark lived with the condition for 13 years before dying of an AIDS-related illness. The Terrence Higgins Trust worked with the production team for the duration of Mark's story.\\"Which issues have been highlighted by EastEnders?\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 2006-10-16. Despite all the public health campaigns concerning HIV transmission, the biggest peak in requests for testing in Britain was seen in January 1991 when Mark Fowler was diagnosed HIV-positive.\\"is the truth stronger in fiction?\\", Telegraph. URL last accessed on 2006-10-16. Carty has commented: \\"I feel that the storyline educated people at a time when there were lots of misconceptions about HIV and AIDS‚Ä¶My main concern was that they'd get it right and, overall, I think they did - because it showed someone living with HIV, as opposed to dying of it.\\"\\"TODD CARTY\\", The Mirror. URL last accessed on 11 November 2007.\\"Carty's 30 years on TV\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 11 November 2007. The storyline was widely applauded for the way it handled the plot and the following issues that the scriptwriters explored, from anti-retroviral drugs, safe sex and prejudice. The storyline was so successful in raising awareness that a 1999 survey by the National AIDS Trust found teenagers garnered most of their information about HIV from the soap.\\"How well does TV and film tackle disease? \\", Aegis. URL last accessed on 2006-10-16. The character of Mark remained in the show for a further 13 years after his re-introduction, and featured in an array of storylines including two failed marriages, which were scripted to highlight the difficulties that can occur in a relationship when one partner has HIV and the other does not. Ultimately Mark overcame the stigma and he enjoyed several years of happy, healthy living before finally succumbing to an AIDS-related illness and dying in April 2004 off-screen. EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge said Carty had made a \\"fantastic contribution\\" to the soap and Mark has been a \\"pivotal figure\\" on Albert Square, but the character had finally run its course.\\"EastEnders' Mark: Was it time to go?\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 2006-10-16. Campaigners have since suggested that Mark's HIV storyline could have been handled better in the latter years. Lisa Power, head of policy at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said \\"in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the gay community\\". She also said \\"he was perhaps killed off too early as advancements in drugs are helping people live for much longer... Saying that, one decent soap episode is worth a thousand leaflets in schools. That is why we would always go out of our way to help scriptwriters. TV and films can be very powerful.\\" =Departure (2003)= On 1 July 2002, it was announced that Mark Fowler had been axed from EastEnders and that the character was set to depart in early 2003. Carty said, \\"I've had 12 brilliant years on EastEnders, and they've been fantastic to me [...] I'll deeply miss all the cast and crew and everyone involved on the show.\\" EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge said that Carty had made a \\"fantastic contribution\\" to the soap and Mark had been a \\"pivotal figure\\" on Albert Square, but the character had finally run its course. She went on to say \\"Todd and I have discussed this at some length and agreed that it was time for Mark to hang up his leather jacket for the last time [...] We will all miss Todd, who is one of our best-loved actors, and wish him every success in the future.\\" BBC One's head of drama John Yorke said, \\"We want to thank Todd for his great contribution to EastEnders over the last 12 years.\\" Some reports disclosed that Carty was \\"upset and angry\\" by the decision to axe Mark. According to Carty, the decision was \\"a bolt from the blue\\" from the producers. On 16 December 2002, it was reported that Mark was to be killed-off. It was also announced that the character's death would be shown off-screen. A spokesperson for the show said, \\"There is now nothing more he can do medically to stop the advancement of the infection [...] Rather than see his family suffer from the deterioration of his health and eventual death, Mark decides to leave Walford to spend his remaining days seeing the world and coming to terms with his fate.\\" Carty said: \\"Portraying someone with HIV has been very challenging at times but to learn Mark has been inspirational to real-life people with HIV is really humbling.\\" Reflecting on his time in the soap, Carty went on to say \\"I've had great fun, made some lovely friends and have been very lucky working with terrific scripts and storylines.\\" Mark's off-screen death aired in April 2004. Reception Carty had said that the late EastEnders star Wendy Richard was like a mother to him. \\"When I was filming my goodbye scenes, those tears were real. Seeing Wendy break down was one of the most poignant moments. The whole day was so emotional - I had to hold it together and stay strong for Wendy\\". Carty had also told the Daily Mirror that the pair had struck up a 20-year friendship after they were cast. Following Mark's departure in February 2003, the BBC was accused of \\"killing\\" HIV victims' hopes. Edinburgh- based HIV charity Waverley Care reacted negatively to scriptwriters for \\"scaring\\" victims away from seeking treatment by \\"painting a bleak picture\\". Real-life HIV survivors also hit out at the BBC for destroying their hope by failing to give an accurate view of the range of treatment now available. However, soap bosses hit back and defended the storyline as an \\"accurate portrayal\\" of many real victims' experiences. They also pointed out that they had the backing of AIDS charity The Terence Higgins Trust. David Johnson, director of Waverley Care, said \\"Scriptwriters for EastEnders - and other soaps - carry a huge burden of responsibility. The current story is a difficult one because, although drug treatments are not straightforward for everyone, many people do very well on them. Encouraging people to come forward for testing is a key issue - the earlier an HIV diagnosis is made, the greater the likelihood of staying well on treatments. Our concern with the Mark Fowler storyline is that it will increase the fear associated with HIV, potentially discouraging people from being tested at all or from starting on drug treatments if they feel there is little hope for the future.\\" A real-life HIV victim had been on a variety of combination therapy treatments since he was diagnosed HIV-positive. Mark‚Äôs departure from EastEnders left the victim \\"outraged\\". He said, \\"I‚Äôm a big soap fan and, until now, feel that the HIV issue had been handled sensitively in EastEnders [...] I was very hurt and upset by the Mark Fowler story. He‚Äôd been told that there wasn‚Äôt another combination of drugs available - even though he‚Äôd only had three. There are new developments in drug therapy all the time and I‚Äôm worried that this storyline will make people give up hope. Or that they won‚Äôt start treatments in the first place.\\" See also *List of EastEnders characters (1985) *List of soap opera recasts *List of HIV-positive television characters References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional characters with HIV/AIDS Category:Fictional market stallholders Category:Television characters introduced in 1985 Category:Male characters in television Category:Beale family (EastEnders) ","title":"Mark Fowler"},{"id":"1963661","text":"WHIO may refer to: * WHIO-TV, a television station (channel 7 analog/41 digital) licensed to Dayton, Ohio, United States * WHIO (AM), a radio station (1290 AM) licensed to Dayton, Ohio, United States * WHIO-FM, a radio station (95.7 FM) licensed to Pleasant Hill, Ohio, United States ","title":"WHIO"},{"id":"1963662","text":"\\"Big\\" Steve Long (died October 28, 1868) was a western lawman and outlaw, achieving notoriety in the Wyoming Territory during the late 1860s. He was one of the earliest examples of an Old West gunman. Because of their lawlessness, he and two half-brothers were lynched by a posse put together by a newly appointed sheriff in 1868. Early life Little is known about Steve Long's early life or childhood. After the American Civil War, he had settled in Laramie, Wyoming. He and his half-brothers, Ace and Con Moyer, established a saloon together in the railroad town. Both Ace and Con helped found Laramie. Long reportedly had spent several years as an early version of a gunfighter before being elected in 1867 as Deputy Marshal of Laramie. It is believed that Long had served during the Civil War, in the Confederate States Army, but under a different name. He migrated to Wyoming around 1866. Lawman and outlaw Long soon earned a reputation as a particularly violent lawman, killing eight men in gunfights within two months. On October 22, 1867, Long opened fire on eight men during a street brawl after his orders to cease were ignored, killing five of the men. He rarely arrested anyone, choosing instead to either intimidate them with the threat of force or shoot them. Long and his brothers used their forceful personalities and his position as the Deputy Marshal to their own financial advantage. Within months of his gaining that position, they had forced several local ranchers to sign over to them the deeds to their properties. Several of those who refused were later confronted while alone by Long, who killed them, always claiming later that the other man had reached for a weapon. If the victim was not carrying a pistol or rifle, Long would place one on his person after killing him. There were never any witnesses. It is alleged that Long killed at least nine men in that fashion during a four-month period. Local residents called the saloon the \\"Bucket of Blood\\" because of the violence that often happened inside. By October 1868, Long had killed thirteen men. Another seven men had been killed under suspicious circumstances, with Long suspected, but his role was never confirmed. There was no evidence to support his being named as the killer in these incidents. Long made little effort to find the alleged murderers, leading to speculation that he had committed those murders. Each of the seven men had been known to have refused to sign over land deeds to Long and his brothers. A local rancher and the first sheriff of Albany County, N. K. Boswell, organized several other ranchers to conspire against the three brothers. Boswell insisted that if they could watch Long closely enough, eventually they could catch him in the act of committing a crime. Then they could act against him with the law on their side. On October 18, 1868, Long attempted to rob a prospector named Rollie \\"Hard Luck\\" Harrison. Harrison drew a pistol, and a gunfight erupted between the two. Long was wounded and retreated. Harrison was killed, dying from his wounds before naming his assailant. . Long confessed to his fiancee how he became wounded, and she told N. K. Boswell. Boswell organized several men in the town. They entered the saloon owned by Long and his brothers on October 28. The posse overwhelmed the three and led them to an unfinished cabin in town. Long was quiet throughout the process. He asked only to be allowed to remove his boots, saying, \\"My mother always said I'd die with my boots on\\". He was lynched barefoot, hanged along with Con and Ace Moyer from the rafters of the cabin. There were no legal actions taken against the members of the lynch mob. A photograph of the three men after they were hanged was taken, and on the back was written, \\"(1) Gunfighter \\"Big\\" Steve Long, (2) Con Moyer, (3) Ace Moyer, A lynching in Laramie Wyo. -1868- Con & Ace were founders of Laramie Wyoming!\\".

Previously, he had served as President of the University of Guelph in Ontario Canada for ten years. Overall, he served as a faculty member and administrator for 47 years in higher education. Biography During his term, Rider University ranked in the top-tier among northern regional universities according to the U.S. News and World Reports annual rankings. During Dr. Rozanski‚Äôs presidency, Rider University introduced fourteen new undergraduate and seven graduate degrees that helped grow overall enrollment by 8%. His commitment to online learning led to the development of more than 170 online courses and degree programs enrolling more than 2,400 students annually. These included an online masters in accounting and undergraduate degrees in business and nursing. In 2007, under Dr. Rozanski‚Äôs leadership, the Westminster College of the Arts was established as Rider‚Äôs fourth college. It integrated Westminster Choir College‚Äôs world-class music program in Princeton with the fine arts programs in dance, music, theater and art in Lawrenceville. During his 12-year term, President Rozanski raised and invested more than $150 million for institutional development. Dr. Rozanski considers his greatest legacy to be the more than 45,000 students who graduated during his 22 years as a university president, 13,000 at Rider alone. And he shook the hands of most of the graduates. Dr. Rozanski held the rank of professor and taught Chinese and Asian history at several universities and colleges. Rozanski Hall, a new classroom complex, was named in his honor shortly after his departure from the University of Guelph. He currently serves on the board of the Starfall Foundation and is a consultant to the Danaher-Lynch Foundation.

It is known for its exquisitely preserved fossils, and is mainly composed of basalts interspersed with siliciclastic sediments.  History  = Japanese occupation = The potential importance of the Yixian Formation was initially recognized during the time the Empire of Japan occupied China's Rehe (\\"Jehol\\") Province after the First battle of Hopei in 1933. Many Japanese scientists had noticed fossil remains of extinct fish and reptiles, possibly the champsosaurs. These initial fossil discoveries made by Japanese scientists vanished once World War II ended in 1945. = Chinese rediscovery = By 1949, when administration of the area passed to the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, the fossils of Yixian were studied only by Chinese scientists. It was not until the 1990s when remarkable fossils of birds and dinosaurs were excavated. Since 1996, a number of dinosaur fossils that have revolutionized knowledge of these animals have been found at Yixian; among them are the first known non-avian theropods with feathers. See Jehol Biota.  Dating  For some time, the formation was believed to be from the Late Jurassic‚ÄìEarly Cretaceous boundary, some 145 mya (million years ago). Radiometric dating has since resolved it to be younger; it is now considered to have been deposited in the Barremian to early Aptian, some 125‚Äì121 mya.Swisher, Carl C., Wang, Yuan-qing, Wang, Xiao-lin, Xu, Xing, Wang, Yuan. (1999). \\"Cretaceous age for the feathered dinosaurs of Liaoning, China\\". Nature 400:58‚Äì61 1 July 1999. The Yixian Formation forms the lowest part of the Jehol group, defined by Gu (1962 and 1983) as a group of geological formations including the Jehol Coal-bearing Beds, the Jehol Oil Shale Beds, and the Jehol Volcanic Rocks.Gu, Z.W. (1983) \\"On the boundary of non-marine Jurassic and Cretaceous in China\\" in: \\"Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, Academica Sinica\\" \\"Stratigraphical Chart in China with Explanatory Text\\" Science Press, Beijing 1983:65‚Äì82. The Yixian Formation is preceded by the older Daohugou Beds, of uncertain Jurassic or Early Cretaceous age, which are sometimes considered part of the Jehol group. The Yixian Formation (including the synonymous Jingangshan, Tuhulu, Jianchang, Lower Volcanic and Volcanic Rock formations) is followed stratigraphically by the slightly younger Jiufotang Formation and the Fuxin Formation. Chiappe et al. argued in 1999 that the oldest beds of the Yixian (those bearing a fauna dominated by confuciusornithid birds) were best separated as a distinct formation, called the Chaomidianzi Formation, with a type locality at the village of Sihetun, approximately 25 km south of Beipiao City.Chiappe, L.M., Ji, S.A., Ji, Q., and Norell, M.A. (1999). \\"Anatomy and systematics of the Confuciusornithidae (Aves) from the Mesozoic of North-eastern China.\\" Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, 1999. However, this classification has fallen out of favor, and the Chaomidianzi Formation is disused as a synonym for the Jianshangou Bed of the Yixian Formation. The Dabeigou Formation in Fengning, Hebei Province may immediately precede the Yixian, or it may be equivalent to the oldest Yixian beds. The Yixian also overlies the Tuchengzi Formation in places. The Yixian Formation is divided into the following subunits, from most recent to oldest: (ages when available from Chang et al., 2009) * Jingangshan Bed (youngest, 122.1 Ma) * Dawangzhangzi Bed * Lujiatun Bed (123.2 Ma) * Jianshangou Bed (124.1 Ma) * Dakangpu Bed (~125 Ma) * Basalt base (oldest, 129.7 Ma) New high-precision 40Ar/39Ar dating provided ages of 125.8 ¬± 1.0 Ma and 126.0 ¬± 0.8 Ma for two basaltic samples from the Lujiatun Unit.Su-Chin Chang, Ke-Qin Gao, Chang-Fu Zhou & Fred Jourdan (2017). New chronostratigraphic constraints on the Yixian Formation with implications for the Jehol Biota. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology (advance online publication); doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.09.026  Ecology  The Yixian Formation represents the second of three major faunal phases that characterize the Jehol Biota, mainly based on changes in invertebrate diversity. In the Yixian, ostracods (seed shrimp) had diversified considerably, despite a very low diversity in the earlier Dabeigou Formation. Other major invertebrate groups in the Yixian include clam shrimp and insects. Insects, as a group, experienced their largest diversification of the entire Mesozoic era in the Yixian. On the other hand, some invertebrate groups, such as bivalves and gastropods (snails and slugs), were numerous but low in diversity, being mainly represented by one or two dominant species (Arguniella in the case of the bivalves). Studies of vertebrates have shown support for the division of the Jehol into phases, and the diversity of fish in the Yixian was distinct from older and younger formations, with Lycoptera as the dominant species. The Yixian preserves the first Jehol dinosaurs and pterosaurs (which have not been found in the older Dabeigou Formation), and the first major radiation of birds (only one bird species is known from the Dabeigou). The Yixian also preserves the largest (and only) mammal radiation so far known from the Jehol group. Most vertebrates showed a tendency to climb trees or become arboreal, including many tree-dwelling birds, and climbing mammals and lizards. Plant life reached its Jehol biota peak in the Yixian. Five species of flowering plant were present (three of Archaefructus, one of Archaeamphora and one of Hyrcantha (formerly Sinocarpus), as were a variety of horsetails that closely resembled modern species. It is possible that increasing animal and plant diversity were linked. The Yixian is characterized by extensive forests, dominated by trees such as ginkgoes, conifers, cycads, and seed fern trees. Ground cover plants included lycopods, horsetails, ferns, and primitive flowering plants, which were rare compared to the others. This plant life grew around a series of freshwater lakes, provided with abundant minerals thanks to periodic volcanic eruptions. Volcanic activity, along with periodic wildfires, and noxious gasses released from the lake bottoms caused the ecosystem to be continually destroyed and regrown. This, along with the wide diversity of habitats in the surrounding region, may have contributed to the fast diversification of life forms present in the Yixian ecosystem.  Climate  With the diversity of plant life in the Yixian well known, including examples of a variety of petrified wood and growth rings, and with the help of chemical analysis, scientists have been able to determine the climate of the formation. The Yixian flora was dominated by conifers closely related to modern species that are found mainly in subtropical and temperate upland forests. The presence of ferns, cycads, and horsetails indicates a generally humid climate. However, evidence from the growth rings of petrified wood indicates that the humidity and water supply dropped regularly. This shows that the wet, humid conditions were punctuated by dry seasons, in which the environment became more arid.Wang, Y., Zheng, S., Yang, X., Zhang, W., and Ni, Q. (2006). \\"The biodiversity and palaeoclimate of conifer floras from the Early Cretaceous deposits in western Liaoning, northeast China.\\" International Symposium on Cretaceous Major Geological Events and Earth System, 56A. Evidence from the study of oxygen isotopes has shown that the average yearly temperature during this time period was 10 degrees celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit), significantly colder than once thought. This indicates a temperate climate with unusually cold winters for the generally warm Mesozoic era, possibly due to northern China's high latitude during this time. A study by Wu et al. (2013) concluded that orbital forcing, which is the effect on climate caused by shifts in the tilt of the Earth's axis and by the shape of the Earth's orbit, contributed to the climate fluctuations of this formation.  Paleobiota  The Yixian Formation is well known for its great diversity of well-preserved specimens and its feathered dinosaurs, such as the large tyrannosauroid Yutyrannus, the therizinosaur Beipiaosaurus and various small birds, along with a selection of non-theropod dinosaurs, such as Bolong, Dongbeititan and Psittacosaurus. Despite popular assumption, Microraptor does not hail from this formation, instead hailing from the younger Jiufotang Formation. However, other microraptorines, such as Sinornithosaurus and Graciliraptor, did indeed inhabit the Yixian. Other biota included the troodontid Mei, the dromaeosaurid Tianyuraptor, the large compsognathid Sinocalliopteryx and the tyrannosauroid Dilong.

Earth Federation The White Base crew, from left to right: Top: Kai Shiden, Ryu Jos√©, Amuro Ray, Fraw Bow, Sayla Mass, Mirai Yashima and Bright Noa; Bottom: Hayato Kobayashi, Katz Hawin, Letz Cofan and Kikka Kitamoto. = Amuro Ray = is the son of Tem Ray, the project leader for the Earth Federation's Project V, which produces the prototype mobile suits Gundam, Guncannon, and Guntank to combat the Principality of Zeon's Zaku. At the beginning of the Mobile Suit Gundam TV series, Amuro is merely a 15-year-old civilian, along with his friends Fraw Bow and Hayato Kobayashi, living in Side 7, one of the few space colonies untouched by the One Year War at the time. Amuro is a talented amateur mechanic, which would be called an Otaku nowadays,Otona no Gundam (Adult's Gundam), Character profile, P. 108 and as a hobby designed the basketball- sized talking robot Haro. Born on Earth in Prince Rupert,Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2, file 1 of Personal History, \\"Born in Prince Rupert, West Coast of North America\\" Like his rival Char Aznable, Amuro got his own nickname during the One Year War: the . He was given this moniker after defeating 14 MS-09R Rick Doms in the Battle of Solomon. Amuro and Char Aznable faced off several times during the course of the One Year War, but it was not until when Lalah Sune was killed during one of their battles that this rivalry turned into a fierce hatred of one another. = Sayla Mass = : is a medical student from the incomplete single space colony of the Earth Federation's Side 7 who ends up on the White Base along with other civilians including Amuro Ray, Fraw Bow, Hayato Kobayashi, Kai Shiden and Mirai Yashima. She would later be revealed to be ), the daughter of the Zeon Republic's founder Zeon Zum Deikun and the younger sister of Char Aznable. Sayla is almost immediately recruited as a soldier, and set to the task of watching over the civilian refugees. With the near total lack of experienced personnel to defend White Base (most original crew members were killed in the Principality of Zeon's attack on Side 7), Sayla first serves as acting captain Bright Noa's communications officer and later as a combat pilot. = Bright Noa = When Char Aznable attacks the colony, Side 7, all the officers on the White Base are incapacitated, leaving Ensign with the highest seniority on the ship, and he assumes command from the wounded Captain Paolo Cassius, who later dies of his injuries. After a series of close calls and with help from Amuro Ray and the Gundam, Bright brings the White Base safely to Federation headquarters at Jaburo. Because of the Zeon forces obsession with the White Base, the Federation allows Bright to remain in command and sends the ship out as a decoy. Bright commands the White Base through several major operations in The One Year War, including the last stand of Zeon at asteroid A Baoa Qu. = Mirai Yashima = is one of the three White Base crew to display Newtype abilities, along with Amuro Ray and Sayla Mass. Mirai is a civilian who joins the White Base crew after the attack on Side 7. Her training as a space glider pilot makes her the best choice to take the White Base's helm, and Mirai soon becomes both Bright Noa's trusted deputy and a surrogate mother to the ship's young crew. She is also the daughter of a powerful and well-connected family, which causes complications later in the series when she is reunited with her fianc√©e Side 6's district attorney Cameron Bloom, whom she disliked as all he cared about was avoiding the war by fleeing to Side 6. Mirai was also briefly attracted to Sleggar Law but Sleggar pointed out that she was just too good for someone like him and Sleggar gave her the ring that belonged to his mother shortly before he died. = Fraw Bow = is Amuro's close friend and confidante, and devoted to his welfare. With Amuro's parents separated and his father Dr. Tem Ray frequently away on business for the Earth Federation's Project V, Fraw takes it upon herself to make sure that the perhaps charitably-described \\"engineering nerd\\" or \\"mecha otaku\\" eats, sleeps, bathes, lives in some degree of cleanliness, and‚Äîin her initial appearance‚Äîfollows military evacuation orders. Fraw and Amuro become crew members of White Base, along other Side 7 civilians. Becoming the primary caretaker of three young children, Katz Hawin, Letz Cofan, and Kikka Kitamoto, in addition to Amuro. As the distance between her and Amuro grows, Fraw joins the medical staff to help distract herself. She is married to Hayato some time after the One Year War. Fraw finishes the war serving on the ship's bridge as White Bases communications officer. = Hayato Kobayashi = is one of Amuro Ray's neighbors on Side 7. Short and stocky and with a tendency towards insecurity, Hayato often measures himself against his friend Amuro's accomplishments. After surviving the attack on his Side 7 home, Hayato becomes the co-pilot for the RX-75 Guntank alongside Ryu Jos√©, largely out of a sense of rivalry with Amuro. After Ryu sacrifices his life to save Amuro from Hamon Crowley, Hayato continues to pilot the Guntank after it is modified for use by a single person. = Kai Shiden = : At the onset of the One Year War in UC 0079, Kai Shiden was living in the space colony Green Oasis in Bunch 1 of Side 7. Kai Shiden is tall and lanky in stature with a mop of gray hair, and his snarky and sarcastic personality often gets him scolded or slapped. After surviving the Zeon attack on Side 7, Kai became one of the many evacuees escaping on the Pegasus class assault carrier SCV-70 White Base. However, due to a shortage of crew and soldiers to staff the warship, Kai was asked to become a pilot to help defend the White Base from frequent Zeon attacks. Kai was assigned to pilot the RX-77 Guncannon mobile suit, the unit he would remain in charge of for the rest of the One Year War. A natural coward, cynic, and pessimist, Kai could often be found on the sidelines making smart-alecky comments. His fighting style leaned towards bombarding foes with the Guncannon's long-range armaments, but when he got in a fix he was able to pull off hand-to-hand attacks with the Guncannon. He dislikes it when things move slowly. However, Kai quickly became disenchanted with war and he decided to desert the White Base when it was docked for repairs in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In Belfast, Kai meets a young girl named Miharu Ratokey who lives just outside the city, and agrees to sneak her onto the White Base and take her to the Earth Federation headquarters in Jaburo, located along the Amazon River in South America. Kai soon figures out that Miharu was actually a hired Zeon spy sent to infiltrate the White Base and discover Jaburo's location. During a sudden Zeon attack on the White Base while traveling over the Atlantic Ocean, Kai and Miharu go out in a Gunperry transport plane. During the battle, controls in the cockpit get stuck and Miharu goes down to help fire the plane's missiles manually. But she is knocked from the Gunperry by the missiles' exhaust blast, and falls out of the plane over the Atlantic Ocean. Miharu's death marks a turning point in Kai's development as he works through his grief. = Ryu Jos√© = : A large, stocky Latino man with a dusky complexion, Ryu was a test pilot-in-training for the Earth Federation on Side 7. When the colony was attacked by Char Aznable, Ryu took control of the Core Fighter jet to protect the White Base. Being a gentle, caring, considerate comrade, Ryu was the best mediator to ease the tension between the uptight Bright Noa and the young civilian recruits. Ryu is killed during the White Base's attack from Crowley Hamon. Though critically wounded in firefights during Ramba Ral's attempted boarding attack, Ryu drives his Core Fighter kamikaze-style into Hamon's fighter in order to save the life of Amuro Ray and the crew of the White Base. His death moves the entire crew of White Base to tears and the reality of war truly began to sink in, as everyone felt responsible for his death. Several crew members even try to call to his spirit for advice later on. Amuro is enraged when the only reward for Ryu's heroism is a three rank posthumous promotion at Jaburo. = Sleggar Law = : Sleggar Law joins the White Base crew after they arrive at Jaburo. Sleggar initially looks down at the White Bases young crew, but soon develops a respect for them. He has a brief romance with Mirai Yashima. However, Sleggar feels that Mirai is too wonderful and deserves better than someone like him, so he rejects further advancement in their relationship. Shortly before his final sortie against the MA-08 Big Zam at the Battle of Solomon, Sleggar gives Mirai a ring that he inherited from his mother. = Matilda Ajan = is the commanding officer of the Earth Federation's Medea supply corps. At times Matilda also serves as a personal envoy for General Revil, carrying messages and orders from him to other ships. When the White Base is trapped in Zeon- controlled airspace over North America, it is the vital supplies delivered by the Medea supply corps, which has allowed the beleaguered assault carrier to make desperately needed repairs and escape over the Pacific Ocean. Due to her habits of showing up when the White Base is in a bind and helping them in whatever way she can, Miss Matilda has been looked to as the guardian angel of the vessel. Also due to her stunning beauty she becomes the dream girl of many of the young male crew members staffing the White Base, especially the young Amuro Ray. Miss Matilda is engaged to Lieutenant Woody Malden, who was a chief military engineer stationed in the Earth Federation headquarters of Jaburo. When the ship reached Asia, Miss Matilda gave the White Base orders to head to Ukraine to take part in Operation Odessa, a large-scale military operation to wrest control of the mining facilities at Odessa away from the Principality of Zeon. However, en route to participate in the battle the White Base is attacked by the Zeon ace pilot trio, the Black Tri-Stars. In order to protect the White Base, Matilda rammed her Medea into one of the Black Tri-Stars' MS-09 Doms, in an attempt to knock it down. But Dom pilot Ortega hit back, smashing the Medea's cockpit so the transporter crashed into the ground exploding and killing Matilda instantly. Lieutenant Junior Grade Matilda Ajan was later listed as killed in action on November 6, U.C.0079. Afterwards, Amuro meets Matilda's fiance Lieutenant Woody in Jaburo and apologizes for not being able to protect Matilda, but Woody forgives him, since it was war, and she died protecting her friends' ship, The White Base. During Char's assault on Jaburo Lieutenant Woody also dies while protecting the ship like his girlfriend did, as he attacked Char using a simple attack hoverfighter that was easily destroyed by Char's Z'Gok, but gave White Base crew members enough time to escape.Mobile Suit Gundam Movie 3: Encounters in Space = General Revil = : Admiral Revil (also referred to as General Revil) is one of the Earth Federation's leading Space Force commanders. He is mentioned often, but does not make any personal appearances until the latter half of the series. Before his appointment as head of the Earth Federation Space Force Revil was a Lieutenant General from the Earth Federation Ground Force. Revil's biggest claim to fame came after being captured by the Zeon's Black Tri-Stars after his flagship Ananke was sunk by Zeon's mobile suit attack forces during the Battle of Loum. Shortly thereafter, Revil, aided by Federal agents and sympathizers within Zeon, escaped to Side 6 and returned to the Federation. Broadcasting from Luna II, he made his famous \\"Zeon is Exhausted!\\" speech from what he saw in Zeon during his capture. This speech boosted the morale of the Federation Forces, caused the Federation to toughen their stance, and resulted in the rejection of the terms of their surrender (it was said that Kycilia Zabi smashed the table in rage after hearing the news). Although this, both sides agreed to a ban on NBC weapons, colony drops and maltreatment of POWs by signing the Antarctic Treaty.  Principality of Zeon  Principality of Zeon, from left to right: Giren Zabi, Dozle Zabi, Degwin Sodo Zabi, Kycilia Zabi, Garma Zabi and Char Aznable. = Char Aznable = = Lalah Sune = : Lalah is a young woman who is the \\"star student\\" of Professor Flanagan due to her strong Newtype abilities, and as such is also one of the key test subjects in the development of Newtype-related weaponry. Being one of the earliest and most successful known Newtypes, her powers are accompanied by a profound spiritual awareness. Despite her gentle nature, Lalah is fiercely loyal to the man who saved her life ‚Äî- Char Aznable, the scheming \\"Red Comet\\". In the novel he found her in an Indian brothel where she worked after losing her parents in the war. In the MSG:Origin, episode 7:Encounter with Lalah, her parents were alive and she was sending money to them from her work helping a mobster win at gambling, this attracts a mob called Manaus, and Char takes her away using a Mobile worker. She was assigned to pilot the Newtype use mobile armor MAN-08 Elmeth as a part of the Newtype research project conducted by the Flanagan Institute. Lalah is ranked as an ensign under Char. Lalah and Amuro Ray first met on Side 6, where Amuro found Lalah in front of a lakeside house. They spoke briefly and Amuro was attracted to her with his Newtype powers. They met again sometime later when Amuro's car got stuck in the mud. Another vehicle pulled over and offered to help him, aboard it was Lalah and Char Aznable, Amuro's archrival (the two had not yet seen each other face to face). Amuro immediately recognised both of them, but Char and Lalah had yet to figure out Amuro's identity. Lalah left a profound impact on Amuro and was considered his first great love. During the Elmeth's test run which saw its Newtype \\"bits\\" weaponry wreak havoc on the Federal Fleet guarding the newly captured Zeon base Solomon, Amuro in the Gundam engaged the Elmeth but found out the pilot was Lalah. Both then realized they were soulmates and shared a \\"Newtype bonding\\", a sort of telepathic bond. Unfortunately Char arrived and chastised Lalah for \\"consorting with the enemy\\" and raised his beam naginata to strike down Amuro's wingman Sayla Mass, piloting the CoreBooster jet. Lalah told Char to stop; for she sensed the pilot was Char's sister Artesia (Sayla Mass is her adopted name since young). Char hesitated but this gave Amuro the opportunity to sever the weapon arm of Char's Gelgoog, rendering it incapacitated. Amuro went for the killing blow but Lalah knocked away Char and took the fatal strike. This has a profound effect on both men, as their rivalry escalates from a professional to a very personal one which culminated in the movie Char's Counterattack. Although she died before the end of the One Year War, Lalah Sune's spirit occasionally returns from beyond the grave to haunt both Char and Amuro Ray, as seen in Char's Counterattack. = Ramba Ral = : Longtime friend of Zeon Zum Deikun, took in Deikun's two children, Casval and Artesia, after Deikun was assassinated. In order to protect them, the Ral family later sent them to live on Earth under the names Edward and Sayla Mass. Ramba Ral joined the Zeon military in Universal Century 0064. He quickly made himself known as a great tactician, and a master of guerrilla warfare. Ramba Ral first made a name for himself as an ace pilot in the Zeon mobile suit forces during the Battle of Loum where his impressive combat abilities and blue MS-04 Zaku I earned him the nickname . Ramba Ral is also sometimes referred to as the \\"Great Blue Star\\",\\"guerrilla guy ral\\" or the \\"Blue Nova\\". Ramba Ral stayed in space for the majority of the One Year War, however after the death of Garma Zabi during the pursuit of the Federation assault carrier White Base Ramba Ral is assigned to lead a Special Pursuit Force and is sent down to Earth on a Zanzibar mobile cruiser. Ramba Ral is ordered to avenge the death of Garma Zabi, and is given a new prototype ground-type mobile suit, the MS-07 Gouf, to do the job with. Soon after arriving on Earth, Ramba Ral decides to have a reconnaissance in force and attacks the White Base on an island in the North Pacific. Soon after gauging the attack strength of the warship and the Gundam, with guerrilla tactics, Ramba Ral retreats. The sheer power of Ramba Ral and his Gouf leave Gundam pilot Amuro Ray terrified. Traveling in a Gallop-Class Land Battleship, Ramba Ral continues to harass the White Base as it journeys across the vast deserts of Central Asia. During the second attack on the White Base, Ramba Ral's wingmate Akos is killed, and Cozun is captured when his Zaku II is disabled and taken back on board the White Base by Amuro Ray piloting the Guncannon. When Cozun escapes from White Base's brig he contacts Ramba Ral and Ramba again attacks the White Base in his Gouf to conduct a rescue. However, Cozun is killed before he can safely escape and Ramba Ral's Gouf is disabled by the Gundam, forcing Ramba Ral to retreat. Not soon afterwards Ramba Ral meets Amuro Ray again (but did not recognize Amuro), who had deserted the White Base with the Gundam after dispute with the captain Bright Noa, and Fraw Bow (who came to drag Amuro back) in a small cafe in the desert town of Sodon. After recognizing Fraw Bow as a Federation soldier, Ramba Ral decides to release her and assigns his men to follow her back to the White Base. When Ramba Ral's forces pinpoint s location they launch a surprise attack using guerrilla tactics. Amuro sees the Zeon mobilizing to launch their attack and he decides to come back with the Gundam for rescue. Amuro attacks Ramba Ral's Gouf and the two slash each other's cockpits open, the two of them realizing that they had just met each other in the cafe. Amuro is able to destroy the Gouf, but Ramba Ral is able to escape by leaping out of the gash in the cockpit hatch and swinging out of the way of the explosion on a grappling hook he had attached to the Gundam's arm. Following his defeat Ramba Ral is contacted by Dozle Zabi and told to contact M'Quve to receive support. However M'Quve refuses to supply Ramba Ral with the new Dom mobile suits he was instructed to give him. Realizing he is alone, Ramba decides that it is his duty as a soldier to do whatever he can to carry out his mission including the use of guerrilla tactics. While the Gallop and a Zaku II distract the White Base's mobile suits Ramba Ral and several of his soldiers attack the White Base in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat and successfully invade the ship. On board the ship Ramba Ral finds Sayla Mass and immediately recognizes her as Artesia Zum Deikun, and he tells her that he was a servant of her father. As Ramba Ral lets his guard down by talking he is shot by Ryu Jos√©, whom he also wounded. Wounded, Ramba Ral retreats into the White Bases secondary bridge and locks himself in. Captain Bright orders Amuro to destroy the secondary bridge, and Amuro tears a hole in the wall. Realizing he is trapped, Ramba Ral arms a grenade and leaps out of the hole, exploding in the Gundam's hand. Ramba Ral was killed in action on the 05th of November, Universal Century 0079. = Crowley Hamon = The elegant and attractive serves as an aide to Ramba Ral. Crowley is also Ramba Ral's lover and he affectionately refers to her as \\"Lady Hamon\\". Crowley Hamon mainly stays on the bridge of the Gallop and helps to coordinate Ramba Ral's attacks during battle. After Ramba Ral's death, Hamon decides to attack the White Base and comes close to destroying the Gundam. However, a wounded Ryu Jose crashes his Core Fighter into the Magella Top, killing them both. = Black Tri-Stars = Composing of three veteran pilots, , , and , the are one of Zeon's most famous group of ace pilots after Char Aznable. Prior to the beginning of the series, the Black Tri-Stars were responsible for the capture of Federation General Revil using their \\"Jetstream Attack.\\" Prior to the Earth Federation's assault on Odessa, the Black Tri-Stars were sent to Earth to reinforce Zeon's defenses. Despite being equipped with new MS-09 Dom mobile suits, each of the Black Tri-Stars were defeated by Amuro and the Gundam, however not before they managed to kill Matilda Ajan. = Zabi Family =  Degwin Sodo Zabi  was formally one of Zeon Zum Deikun's trusted allies, but apparently masterminded Deikun's death and used the murder his son Sasro to take over Zeon and establish it into a Principality to unite his people and achieves their ideals. However, Garma's death caused a despondent Degwin to gradually lose power to Gihren, who orchestrated his father's death when he attempted a final plea with the Federation's General Revil for peace.  Gihren Zabi  : is the oldest son of Degwin and one of the heads of the Principality of Zeon, effectively taking over Zeon when his father withdraws from his daily duties following the death of Garma while warping Deikun's ideals to motivate the Zeon people into believing that they are the master race. At one point, Degwin compares Gihren's ideals to those of Adolf Hitler, warning his son not to take things too far and end up losing. After killing his father with the Solar Ray Cannon to keep the war going, Gihren is executed during the Battle of A Baoa Qu by Kycilia after admitting his act of patricide. Gihren's most notable scene is his speech at Garma's state funeral, possibly being the debut of the trademark salute \\"Sieg Zeon!\\" American Rock musician Andrew W.K. dubbed a famous speech of this character in his cover album Gundam Rock released during the 30th anniversary of the Gundam franchise.  Sasro Zabi  Sasro Zabi, introduced in Gundam: The Origin, is the 2nd born son of Dewgin who considered one of his family's prized members for being an adept manipulator of public opinion. This was shown by him using Deikun's death to stir anti-Federation propaganda among the Munzo citizens. Sasro was later killed in the car explosion that scarred his young brother Dozle. This incident was apparently caused by Kycilia in retaliation for Sasro slapping her earlier for allowing Deikun's family to take refuge in the Ral household. Sasro's death ultimately enabled the Zabis' rise to power.  Dozle Zabi  : is Degwin's third born son and Zeon's Space Attack Force Commander, tasked during the One Year War to move fleets to and from various points in space to secure victory. Tall and burly, his face scarred from the explosion that killed his brother Sasro, Dozle casts a fearsome appearance at first glance but he is actually one of the more likable of the Zabi family as he a good man to his troops along with being devoted to his wife Zena and their baby daughter Mineva Lao Zabi. Dozle is closest to his younger brother Garma and actually looks forward to the day when Garma becomes an admiral in his own right. Dozle dismisses Char Aznable from his division, blaming him (though not suspecting him of foul play) for incompetence in the battle that resulted in Garma's death. Dozle especially despises his sister Kycilia and this feeling is only increased when she takes Char under her wing. Dozle is revered by his troops in the Space Attack Force for personally leading them in battle. He and his bodyguard and close friend Shin Matsunaga were known to stage frontline \\"inspections\\" in his custom MS-06F Zaku II mobile suit, which typically became impromptu raids on nearby Earth Federation forces. Dozle's command center is located in the heart of the asteroid Solomon (later renamed Konpei Island by the Federation), and it is here that Dozle made his last stand. Late in UC0079 the Federation launched an offensive against Solomon, utilizing their remaining Salamis and Magellan class vessels. When the Federation's Public class assault ships successfully deployed their beam dispersion smoke, Dozle ordered the mandatory evacuation of all non-essential personnel. At the same time the Federation deployed its first Solar System array at Solomon, which destroyed anything attempting to leave. Dozle mounted his own mobile armour, the MA-08 Big Zam, and flew out to buy time for the evacuees, and shortly thereafter was engaged by the Federation's Gundam mobile suit. During battle his Big Zam's I-Field generator is disabled by a kamikaze attack from a core fighter, and his Big Zam is finally disabled by the Gundam. Dozle then exists the Big Zam's cockpit and fires a machinegun at the Gundam, causing Amuro to temporarily be stricken with fear and doubt. He was caught in the subsequent explosion of the Big Zam and killed. His death marked the beginning of the end for Zeon forces in space.  Kycilia Zabi  : is the only daughter of Degwin Sodo Zabi who desires to be taken seriously, fiercely loyal to her people and subordinates yet an utterly merciless manipulator. Initially a security official in the Zeon homeland at the time of Zeon Zum Deikun's death, having her older brother Sasro Zabi killed for him slapping her over letting Deikun's children be sheltered by the Ral family, Kycilia is tasked with eliminating Deikun's family and loyalists. During the One War Year, placed in charge of Zeon's Mobile Suit Forces, Kycilia shows herself able to adapt to the changing technology while equally proficient in intelligence gathering while establishing numerous elite mobile suit units. She would later take Char Aznable under her wing, unaware that he is actually Casval Deikun whom she assumed to have killed. During the Battle of A Baoa Qu, Kycilia took full command of Zeon after executing Gihren upon learning that he killed their father. Losing the support of Gihren's loyalists, Kycilia orders her remaining forces to fall back and ends up being killed when Char fires a rocket launcher at her through the window of her flagship Chimera, which the Federation warships destroyed moments after.  Garma Zabi  : is the youngest son of Degwin Sodo Zabi, commander of Zeon forces in North America, and academy classmate and friend of Char Aznable. Garma first appears after Char forces the Federation ship White Base off course during reentry into Earth's atmosphere and landed the heart of Zeon-controlled territory. Eager to prove himself to his older sister Kycilia, Garma pursues White Base with the full support of Char, unaware of Char's treachery. In a last attempt to prevent White Base from escaping, Garma personally leads another attack to capture the Federation ship. However, Char intentionally misdirects the Zeon forces, allowing White Base to attack Garma's Gaw air carrier from behind. Shocked by Char's treachery, Garma turns the Gaw around and attempts to ram White Base, only to fall short. Garma's death sends shock waves though the Zeon forces, especially his father, Degwin Sodo, and older brother, Dozle. During Garma's state funeral, eldest brother Gihren uses Garma's death as propaganda to rally the Zeon forces to continue fighting. = M'Quve = : is a colonel for the Zeon ground forces under the command of Kycilia Zabi and supervises mining operations and supplies for the war effort. Decadent and amoral, M'quve fancies crystal vases, which he collects, in particular a Song Dynasty porcelain vase he acquired (which he intended to give to Kycilia Zabi as a present). He sees Char Aznable as somewhat of a rival and upstart. Upon destruction of his Odessa Base operating in Europe by the Earth Federation Forces, M'quve flees to space where he eventually meets the White Base and Amuro Ray's Gundam in battle at Texas Colony. There, M'quve pilots a melee- customized mobile suit, a prototype YMS-15 Gyan, and faces Amuro personally, only to be defeated and killed.

Biography Nightingale began in 1995 as a solo goth rock project of Dan Swan√∂, designed to explore his brief fascination with the genre, also evident on Edge of Sanity tracks such as \\"Sacrificed\\". The first album The Breathing Shadow was recorded and mastered by Swan√∂ alone in the space of a week at his home Unisound studio, and has been described by some as a tribute to legendary goth rock band The Sisters of Mercy, whose sound it does indeed resemble. The second album The Closing Chronicles was recorded in April 1996 with his brother Dag acting as producer and contributing some guitar parts. Unlike the first album, it is somewhat influenced by progressive rock and heavy metal, and continues the conceptual storyline that began in The Breathing Shadow to the logical conclusion of the central characters' death, as it was intended to be the last Nightingale album. After this the band went on semi-hiatus, playing a couple of live concerts in small venues around √ñrebro with future permanent band member Erik Oskarsson on bass and Ari Halinoja playing the drums. The second concert, in October 1998 is remarkable because it was one of the few times Edge of Sanity songs were performed live by Swan√∂, the band adding two lighter tracks to bulk out their set (Swan√∂ scarcely performed live with Edge of Sanity, citing his inability to sustain death metal vocals for long enough). The band returned to Unisound in April 1999 to expand upon a lost demo of the track \\"I Return\\" recorded by Dan and Dag in September 1998. The album \\"I\\" from 2000 is a prequel to the first two albums, half composed by Dan and half by Dag, several of the tracks, such as \\"Alonely\\" and \\"Dead or Alive\\" being recycled by Dag from previously abandoned projects and given new lyrics (the originals being both written in Swedish and outside the conceptual storyline). For the recording of \\"Alive Again\\" in May 2002 (a sequel to the original Breathing Shadow Trilogy of \\"I\\", \\"The Breathing Shadow\\" and \\"The Closing Chronicles\\") the band was filled out with Tom Bj√∂rn on drums and Erik Oskarsson returning as a permanent member. This record received the most critical acclaim yet upon its release in February 2003, partly owing to the increased exposure caused by their signing of a distribution deal with American label The End Records. They played a series of live shows before travelling to V√§ster√•s in June 2004 to record Invisible, which is the band's first departure from their conceptual storyline approach, dealing with a wide array of topics from love to history. Before going on their first major tour, the band re-recorded a set of tracks for a best-of album, Nightfall Overture, containing songs from their first four conceptual albums, an Edge of Sanity track and one new Nightingale song. Dan and Dag Swan√∂ live at Nosturi In 2006 the band concluded the second and last day of the international progressive rock festival, InProg 2006. Later that year Dag stated on his website that he will no longer be using his alias Tom Nouga; The band's sixth album White Darkness was released 4 June 2007. On October 19, 2014, Nightingale released their seventh studio album entitled Retribution, a follow-up to 2007's White Darkness through the band's new worldwide label InsideOut Music on November 10, 2014 in Europe and January 25, 2015 in North America.

She was played by actress Wendy Richard between the first episode on 19 February 1985 and 25 December 2006. Pauline was created by scriptwriter Tony Holland and producer Julia Smith as one of EastEnders' original characters. She made her debut in the soap's first episode on 19 February 1985, and remained for twenty-one years and ten months, making her the second- longest-running original character, surpassed only by her nephew, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Pauline is a member of the Beale family. Her storylines focus on drudgery, money worries and family troubles. The matriarchal stalwart of the fictional London community of Albert Square, she is at first portrayed as a loving, doting, very family-oriented mother. In later years, however, she becomes a more stoic, opinionated battle-axe who alienates her relatives through overbearing interference. Pauline is married to the downtrodden Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher); she finds out he has had a one-night stand with Christine Hewitt (Elizabeth Power), which leads to Pauline hitting him with a frying pan. Their marriage remains rocky until his death in 1996. She is used for comedic purposes in scenes with her launderette colleague, Dot Cotton (June Brown), and scriptwriters included many feuds in her narrative, most notably with her daughter-in-law, Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), a family friend who got her daughter, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), pregnant at 16. A famous episode in 1986, which includes Pauline discovering that Den is the father of Michelle's baby, drew over 30 million viewers, and was listed at number 36 in The Times' 1998 list of \\"Top 100 cult moments in Film\\". Richard announced Pauline's retirement from the serial in July 2006, and the character was killed off in a \\"whodunnit?\\" murder storyline, with Richard making her final appearance on 25 December 2006. Pauline was a staple in the UK press during her time in EastEnders, representative of the symbiosis between Britain's soaps and tabloid newspapers. Widely read tabloids, such as The Sun and Daily Mirror, would routinely publish articles about forthcoming developments in Pauline's storylines.\\"Britain's tabloids and Britain's soaps feed off each other: newspapers publish articles about forthcoming developments in shows like \\"EastEnders\\" and viewers tune in to watch the prophecies come true.\\" Critical opinion on the character differs. She has been described as a \\"legend\\" and a television icon, but was also voted the 35th \\"most annoying person of 2006\\" (being the only fictional character to appear on the list). The character is well-known even outside of the show's viewer-base, and away from the on-screen serial, Pauline has been the subject of television documentaries, behind-the- scenes books, tie-in novels, and comedy sketch shows. Character creation =Background= Pauline Fowler is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland (1940‚Äì2007) and Julia Smith (1927‚Äì1997). Holland had drawn on his own London background for inspiration, naming three of the original characters after his own relatives, specifically his aunt Lou and her children, Holland's cousins, the fraternal twins Pete and Pauline. This family setup of a woman named Lou Beale, with twin children Pete and Pauline, was recreated on-screen as the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers.EastEnders: The Inside Story, pp. 49‚Äì50 Pauline's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appears in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. =Casting= From the beginning, Smith considered the role ideal for Wendy Richard, with whom she had worked on the 1960s BBC soap, The Newcomers;Smith, Julia; Holland, Tony pp. 129‚Äì130 Holland and Smith decided to approach her about the role, even though their casting policy was not to use \\"stars\\"‚ÄîRichard was already well known in the UK for playing glamorous roles, such as Shirley Brahms in the successful sitcom Are You Being Served? At their first meeting, Tony Holland informed Richard that they were planning a programme that would not \\"duck social issues but would be a hard-hitting drama including teenage pregnancy, drugs, racial conflict, prostitution, rape, mental illness, homosexuality, alcoholism, and muggings among its subjects.\\" In order to carry such controversial storylines, Richard was told that \\"powerful characters to whom things just naturally happened\\" had been invented, and two families, the Fowlers and the Beales, were to form the core of the soap's narrative. In her autobiography, Richard states, \\"If I accepted, my character was to be Pauline Fowler. A middle-aged mother of two teenagers, with a late baby on the way, Pauline worked part-time at the launderette, voted Labour and supported Arsenal. She was married to Arthur, who was out of work and was really a bit of a failure, not much good at anything in life.\\" Richard thought it sounded like a challenging role.Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 113 There were initial fears that Richard's glamorous image would not work for the character and Smith also feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age. Richard has commented, \\"although it would be such a huge transformation of my screen image, it was after all my twenty-fifth year in showbusiness, and I'd realised that I couldn't go on playing dolly birds forever ... I knew right away I would be mad to turn down the part of Pauline.\\" After she accepted the role, Richard was told by Julia Smith that she would have to change her appearance, to make it more in keeping with Pauline's unglamorous lifestyle. This included having her hair cut. Richard commented on this: \\"I was very proud of my long hair, which had taken me years to grow. I hadn't had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly, I agreed ... I cried my eyes out for the rest of the day after that traumatic hair cut.\\"Wiggins, Lizzie, pp. 113‚Äì114 From September 1984, Richard was involved in pre-production of the series, covering every angle, from hair, costume design and make-up to organising the set interior of her character's screen house. Richard has said that Pauline had been given extensive biographical detail, including minute specifics, such as her fictional time of her birth: \\"It was vital that we should get to know our own characters intimately and so the cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our 'relations' ... it was essential to develop the rapport that families, who'd been together for years, would naturally have.\\"Wiggins, Lizzie, pp. 115‚Äì116 Richard's casting was considered to be \\"a giant leap of faith\\" by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately \\"landed on its feet\\", because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in EastEnders' history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years. Character development and impact =Lineage and personality= The character of Pauline was a cornerstone of EastEnders; the lynchpin of the Fowler/Beale family around whom the soap was originally structured. At the beginning of the serial in 1985, Pauline was a 40-year-old married mother with two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, and another child on the way. The fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind-the-scenes books such as EastEnders: The Inside Story, and the second tie-in novel by Hugh Miller, Swings and Roundabouts, which explains that Pauline was born and raised at 45 Albert Square, where she lived for her entire life. She married Arthur Fowler in 1965, raising her own children in the same house where she grew up.Swings and Roundabouts, p. 69 Whereas most of the other female characters in EastEnders were portrayed in a somewhat more glamorous working-class way, Pauline Fowler was the exception to the rule, being the sole character to represent the \\"homely and domestic\\" side of the Beale family. As the serial progressed, the character altered from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the show's early years, she became a sombre battle-axe, hardened by a life of misery in Albert Square. Other characters refer to her as \\"Fowler the growler\\", and in the Evening Gazette she was described as \\"the Boadicea of battle-axes.\\" The initial change in her demeanour is traced back to the death of her mother, Lou Beale (Anna Wing), a fierce dowager, who ruled over her family with a \\"rod of iron\\".EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square, p. 57 Following Lou's screen funeral in July 1988, Pauline retorts, \\"Shut up Arthur Fowler, no one interrupts Pauline Beale when she's in full flow\\", a line that was used similarly by Lou in the episode that preceded her own death. This parallel symbolised the transference of the family's matriarchal role from Lou to Pauline.EastEnders airdate 28 July 1988EastEnders airdate 26 July 1988 Wendy Richard indicated that both she and show creator Julia Smith had always intended for Pauline to become like her mother, and former EastEnders executive producer John Yorke has commented on the importance of the lineage between the two characters: \\"[Pauline] endures, stoically and heroically, whatever life may throw at her, just as her mother did before her. This sense of lineage is vitally important, too. Pauline has been in the show since its start and was handed the role of matriarch on Lou Beale's death.\\" =Early storylines= In the first episode, it is revealed that Pauline, aged 40, is pregnant with her third child. The character's pregnancy quickly became a prominent storyline within the series. Pauline, against her mother's opposition, is determined to keep the baby.Brake, Colin, p. 28 The storyline was used to spread a public message on the increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies, with Pauline undergoing amniocentesis tests.Wiggins, p. 118 The storyline culminates with the birth of the serial's first baby, Martin, in July 1985. Pauline's early storylines concentrate on family and money troubles: coping with her husband Arthur's redundancy, mental breakdown and imprisonment; eldest son Mark's delinquency; and daughter Michelle's teenage pregnancy. In 1989, the character was used to highlight another important gynaecological health issue, fibroids.Brake, Colin, p. 74 The storyline sees Pauline ignoring health problems, such as chronic fatigue, and using homoeopathic preparations rather than seeking medical assistance. Her fibroids are discovered by chance, when the character Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) knocks her down in his Austin Mini. In the 1989 Boxing Day episode, Pauline spends time in hospital, recovering from a necessary hysterectomy. Wendy Richard has since revealed that the storyline had originally been scripted differently. Before the outcome of Pauline's illness was screened, producers had decided that the character was to be killed off with cancer. This was a decision that had been made by the show's boss, Mike Gibbon, to refresh the format by replacing some of the serial's older characters. The scriptwriters went as far as giving Pauline a mystery illness. The newly appointed executive producer, Michael Ferguson, decided to scrap the original storyline, believing that Pauline, as one of the soap's original characters, was too valuable an asset to lose. The storyline was rewritten and the character was given a different gynaecological ailment that was treatable.Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 149 =Marriage to Arthur Fowler= Pauline's marriage to the luckless Arthur is central to her character, remaining one of her defining traits even after his death in 1996. The dynamics of the relationship were clear from the beginning of the programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that holds the Fowler family together, while Arthur is depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the programme, has commented that \\"[Pauline and Arthur] represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man ... Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved like a little boy, while Pauline had to make the decisions and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression.\\" Pauline and Arthur were generally seen as the most stable couple in the show, so Arthur's affair with Christine Hewitt (Lizzie Power) came as a shock to viewers.Brake, Colin, p. 128 The storyline was long-running, beginning early in 1992 with the introduction of lonely divorcee Christine, who employs Arthur to tend to her garden. A romance between Arthur and Christine steadily develops throughout the year, facilitated by Pauline's lengthy absence‚Äîshe is called abroad to tend to her crippled brother Kenny in early June, and she does not return until late September‚Äîin reality, Wendy Richard had to be temporarily written out of EastEnders to allow her to act in Grace and Favour.Brake, Colin, p. 107 The build-up to the affair contains many twists and turns, starting with Arthur's rebuff of Christine's advances, then a confrontation between Pauline and Christine, which convinces Pauline of Arthur's innocence and leaves her feeling \\"strangely sorry for the pathetic, lonely figure, who obviously drank too much\\".Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 164 The episode in which Arthur finally gives into temptation and sleeps with Christine aired on Christmas Eve 1992. The storyline continued throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater demands on Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless he does so himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would find out about the affair; \\"should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?\\" In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, \\"an act of betrayal on a massive scale.\\" Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this \\"iconic\\" scene: \\"It was one of the few times when you saw Pauline really, really let rip ... you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did.\\" This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in EastEnders: The First Ten Years and is described by Wendy Richard as \\"Pauline's crowning moment.\\" Pauline hits Arthur with a frying pan after he admits to an affair with Christine Hewitt For a while it seems that EastEnders' \\"most solid\\" marriage is over, but Arthur spends the rest of 1993 trying to convince Pauline that it is worth saving and they eventually reconcile.Brake, Colin, p. 118 However, more tragedy follows, when Arthur is framed by a conman, Willy Roper (dubbed \\"Wicked Willy\\" by the British press), and wrongfully imprisoned for embezzlement in 1995. The storyline captured the public's imagination and a nationwide \\"Free Arthur Fowler\\" campaign was launched. \\"Arthur Fowler Is Innocent\\" T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the UK singles chart promoting the campaign. Arthur's imprisonment was a precursor to the final exit of actor Bill Treacher, who decided to leave EastEnders after 11 years playing Arthur. While Arthur goes to pieces in prison, Pauline is heavily embroiled in the storyline pertaining to his eventual release. For several months viewers witnessed Willy attempt to woo Pauline, but she eventually uncovers his deception and then resorts to uncharacteristic seduction to gain his confession. A critic for the Sunday Mirror commented, \\"Pauline Fowler deserves a Golden Cardie Award for her performance in EastEnders. The way which she extracted a confession from Willy Roper over the money he stole was nothing short of brilliant.\\" Arthur is exonerated, but his joyful reunion with Pauline is cut short when he dies of a brain haemorrhage shortly after his release. His death ends an 11-year screen marriage, the longest run of any marriage in the serial. =Importance of family= Pauline remains a family-oriented character throughout the course of the show. A \\"fiercely loyal, but overbearing mother\\"; sheltering and taking on the major responsibilities of her children and frequently stressing the importance of family. She is portrayed as a traditionalist, with strict rules and beliefs‚Äîthe first to criticise, but also the first to defend her children, often interfering in their issues and causing rifts in their relationships. The quintessential matriarch, she has also been compared with Queen Elizabeth, with the storylines in the fictional Albert Square, mirroring the troubles of England as a whole. In Monarchies: What Are Kings and Queens For, the author points out similarities between the matriarchal nature of Pauline's character, and that of the Queen. \\"Both exhibit a rich mix of suffering and duty. Pauline has tried to bring up her family as best she can, even though it hasn't always been easy. Her offspring have caused her nothing but trials and tribulations; her husband has been wayward at times and caused her several eyebrow-raising moments. But Pauline has steadfastly carried on ...\\"Monarchies, p. 122 Early storylines between Pauline and her two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, show her to be a doting mother, forgiving of Mark's wayward behaviour, and supportive when Michelle decides to become a teenage mum. Pauline is devoted to her twin brother Pete, dutiful to her mother Lou, allegiant to her husband Arthur, and a shoulder for her nephew, Ian, to cry on. Wendy Richard commented in 1990, \\"It's important for her to keep the family together. That's why when her problem son Mark suddenly came home [in 1990], it was like her winning the pools ... She had to take a lot of shocks from Michelle and I think she coped remarkably well.\\" As the serial progressed, Pauline contends with a plethora of family upsets, which include many deaths‚Äîher mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996‚Äîas well as her elder son Mark's fatal battle with HIV. After a year long build-up, Mark is shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on Boxing Day 1991, attracting 19 million viewers. Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline's reaction to Mark's news: \\"To say she was shell- shocked was an understatement and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from AIDS at any moment.\\"Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 157 The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggles to come to terms with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when EastEnders tackled it in 1991. When the storyline initially aired, more people went for a HIV test in Britain than at any other time. Wendy Richard commented: \\"The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and AIDS are not exactly the same thing. The Minister of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across.\\" The HIV storyline came to an end on-screen in 2003, when executive producer Louise Berridge decided to axe Mark Fowler. In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: \\"I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying‚Äîbut everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go.\\" Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness. In the latter years of her time in the soap, Pauline changes from a caring mother into a more inflexible battle-axe. Pauline's relationship with Martin is often shown to be strained by Pauline's refusal to release control over his life. Though initially a teenage delinquent, following Mark's death in 2004, Martin becomes Pauline's \\"dutiful son\\", forced to put his mother's wishes above those of his wife‚Äîa recurring theme within the serial. Eventually, this causes a rift between the two characters. When Martin goes against his mother's wishes in 2006 and rekindles a romance with his adulterous ex-wife Sonia, Pauline cuts him out of her life. Television personality Paul O'Grady addressed Pauline's refusal to \\"share her son like a normal mother\\", commenting, \\"she's suspicious of anybody that comes into the family who wants to take her son away from her. She has already lost one son; she has lost her husband, so she's hanging onto the last [son] like a mother tiger with her cub.\\" =Friends and enemies= The character's narrative also included various feuds, most notably with the soap's lothario Den Watts, a family-friend who gets Pauline's daughter Michelle pregnant at the age of 16. EastEnders pulled in the biggest television audience of the 1980s when over 30 million people watched the 1986 Christmas Day episode in which Pauline discovers that Den is the father of her granddaughter, Vicki. Wendy Richard has commented on the hostility between the characters \\"once Pauline realised that Dennis was Vicki's father, she was out to get him one way or another\\" and actor Leslie Grantham, who played Den, added \\"from then on it was out and out war, which was great!\\" An array of confrontations between Den and Pauline occur, as she tries to force him to leave Walford and keep him away from her family. The feud appears to end in 1989 when the character Den is shot and presumed dead, but it is ignited once again in 2003 when Den is re-introduced, 14 years after he supposedly died. 2005 saw Den killed off for the final time, and although Pauline is not directly responsible for killing him, the item used to bludgeon him to death turns out to be her dog-shaped iron doorstop, which has been described as \\"a nice touch of pathos\\". A large proportion of the character's scenes take place on the set of Walford's launderette, where Pauline works as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in EastEnders. Here, Pauline is frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Dot Cotton. The two characters share one of the soap's most enduring screen friendships and their scenes together are often used to provide humour. Particular emphasis is placed on their differences, which lead to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 sees them \\"buried alive\\" underneath a collapsed fairground ride, in the midst of a cake-selling war. However, Pauline and Dot are most frequently shown gossiping, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo has been described by television personality Paul O'Grady as a \\"fabulous double-act\\": \\"Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd never tell anybody else.\\" Pauline is shown to be particularly hostile to the various female characters that feature in her sons' lives, and she epitomises the archetypal \\"mother-in-law from hell\\". One of Pauline's most notable feuds is with her youngest son Martin's wife, Sonia. Animosity between the characters begins in 2000, when Sonia gives birth to Pauline's grandchild and decides to give the baby Chloe (later renamed Rebecca) up for adoption. In the storyline, Pauline tries unsuccessfully to fight for custody, leading Sonia to retort \\"YOU want to bring up Chloe? You couldn't bring up phlegm!\\"EastEnders, airdate 11 January 2001 The feuding over Chloe is revisited in storylines throughout 2005 and 2006, when first Pauline is shown to visit her adopted granddaughter against Sonia and Martin's wishes, and then, following Sonia's affair with Naomi Julien, Pauline refuses to give Sonia access to the child after Martin regains custody. Critic for The Guardian, Grace Dent, commented \\"At one point, you couldn't move around Walford for hitmen and gangsters, but now they've all been written out ... leaving Pauline Fowler to reign the square like sodding Pablo Escobar in a sky-blue tabard and ski-pants, decreeing who can see their own kids, who can drink where and what everyone's eating in the cafe so as they won't spoil their teas. If I was Sonia, I'd have ransacked the hospital's dangerous drugs box by now and given that old crone a renal meltdown.\\" Various rows, slaps and insults were featured between the characters, caused by Pauline's continuous interference in Sonia's relationships with Martin and Rebecca. As Martin began to cede, allowing Sonia access to their daughter, Pauline was shown to concoct ever more elaborate ways to obstruct Sonia's involvement. During her latter years in EastEnders, Pauline is rarely without her Cairn Terrier, Betty. The dog is a stray taken in by the Fowler family in 2004, who quickly becomes Pauline's inseparable sidekick. Wendy Richard has since revealed that it was her decision for Pauline to own a Cairn: \\"When EastEnders asked if Pauline should have a dog I said it had to be a Cairn Terrier‚Äîand Betty joined us! She's wonderful, she loves me and I love her.\\"(13 January 2006) \\"Real Lives: 'Dogs For Disabled Children Are Vital\\" All About Soap magazine, pp.5, 10, 12, 42‚Äì43 In the on-screen story, the dog is named after Pauline's aunt Betty, but in reality, Wendy Richard named her after Mollie Sugden's fictional character Betty Slocombe, who appeared along with Richard's Shirley Brahms in the sitcom, Are You Being Served? =Second marriage= Several eligible bachelors are shown to express their interest in Pauline over the years, including the characters Derek Taylor in 1987, Danny Taurus in 1993, Jeff Healy (who proposes) in 1999, Eddie Skinner in 2000, and Terry Raymond, with whom she goes on a blind date in 2001. However, the character remains staunchly faithful to her late husband's memory, refusing to let the relationships progress beyond companionship. In 2001 Derek Harkinson (Ian Lavender) is introduced, an old school friend of Pauline's. Initial scripts indicated that Derek was being groomed as a romantic interest for Pauline, which she is shown to welcome. However, the storyline takes a twist when he reveals, to her shock, that he is gay. 2002 sees Derek move in with the Fowler family, unconventionally settling into the show as a replacement father figure for Mark and Martin and as Pauline's best friend. In 2005, Pauline embarks on a romance with a new character, Joe Macer (Ray Brooks), whom she meets at salsa classes. A relationship develops, and despite her initial trepidation, Pauline remarries in 2006, after almost a decade alone. Pauline's marriage to Joe was an attempt to give the character a \\"new lease of life\\", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with EastEnders' 21st anniversary. Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the \\"Fowler\\" surname. However, in July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she was leaving EastEnders. Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with Ray Brooks, who played Joe, as she did with Bill Treacher, who played Arthur. She refuted producers' opinions that Pauline and Joe \\"looked good together\\" and felt that she and Brooks had to work very hard to turn them into a \\"realistic- looking couple.\\" Within the storyline, just two months after the wedding, Pauline's marriage is shown to sour after she discovers Joe's criminal past. Their relationship steadily deteriorates throughout the year, and in December 2006 Pauline ends the marriage‚Äîremoving her wedding ring and informing Joe that he \\"was half the man that Arthur had been, that she had never really loved him and that their sex life was a sham.\\" The resulting row sees Joe insult Pauline's family‚Äîsuggesting that her \\"perfect marriage\\" with Arthur was \\"nothing but a fantasy\\" and branding Mark \\"diseased\\", Michelle a \\"scrubber\\" and Arthur a \\"con\\"‚Äîto which Pauline responds by smashing a plate over his head. Wendy Richard commented, \\"It was not just the memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man. That is what caused the marriage to be a non-starter. Pauline was not mean to Joe, he used her ... and lied to her.\\" =Deception, reclusiveness and death= Viewers saw the slow build-up to Pauline's climactic exit throughout the latter part of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a brain tumour to scupper the revived relationship between her son Martin and his ex-wife Sonia, marital breakdown, and finally ostracism after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: \\"she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia is more than just a thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia‚Äîanother way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times ... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story.\\" The character was killed off in a dramatic storyline, which aired on Christmas Day 2006 and was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers. The episode sees Sonia denouncing Pauline as \\"sick\\" for not wanting to share her son with the woman he loved, to which Pauline retorts, \\"I'll tell you what's sick. You. Daughter of a scrubber, lesbian, under-age mother who gave away her own baby.\\" The row culminates with Sonia slapping Pauline, causing her to fall to the floor and break the Fowler fruit bowl‚Äî\\"the enduring symbol of her family, which smashed, significantly, into smithereens.\\" Though Pauline resolves to stay and reunite with her family in the end, she does not get the chance, as she collapses and dies in the middle of Albert Square, leaving both characters and viewers in uncertainty about the cause of her demise. The Christmas Day episodes, written by Simon Ashdown, drew on the show's early history to mark the occasion of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasised by the use of flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for The Times, Tim Teeman, commented that \\"Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl.\\" In addition, her parting scene with the other EastEnders long-serving \\"grand dame\\" Dot Cotton (played by June Brown) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: \\"The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot ... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved.\\" Richard herself has been less complimentary about her alter ego's departure. She has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's \\"changing character\\" and \\"depressing final storyline\\". In an interview with the Biography Channel she explained: \\"I did say, promise me you won't make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did ... I wasn't too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline's character ... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That's what [show creator] Julia Smith wanted, and that's what I felt was right, so I resigned ... I think it's a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now ... There was so much history with that family.\\" The storyline continued into 2007, as first Pauline's funeral is interrupted by the police in order to perform an autopsy on her body, and then Pauline's nemesis Sonia is arrested for the murder. It is later revealed that the killing blow had actually come from Pauline's husband Joe, who breaks down and confesses to Dot that he had rowed with Pauline on Christmas Day (off-screen) and, in a fury, struck her across the head with a frying pan, causing a brain haemorrhage that claimed her life. The plot's eventual climax in February 2007 led to the exits of several established characters connected with Pauline. This included Martin, Sonia, and Joe, who is dramatically killed off after confessing to Pauline's murder, by falling out of the Fowlers' first floor window while trying to apprehend a hysterical Dot. Pauline is cremated, and her ashes buried at Arthur's graveside, by Dot, in an episode that aired in June 2007. As a final tribute to Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special television programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional look back at Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme‚Äîwhich aired on New Year's Day, 2007‚ÄîWendy Richard reflected upon how \\"proud\\" she was of her character, commenting: \\"Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems ... She wasn't always grumpy ... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame ... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That was the most important thing in her life.\\" Reception At the time of her departure from the serial, Pauline was the second-longest running character to feature in EastEnders and one of only two original characters to remain in the show for almost 22 years. Her baggy woolly cardigan and long-suffering nature have led to her being labelled as a soap institution, a \\"soap legend\\" and a \\"television icon\\". Actress Wendy Richard was awarded an Order of the British Empire MBE medal in 2000 by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, and when the Queen visited the set of EastEnders in 2001, Wendy Richard was the first actress introduced, who then accompanied her and Prince Philip on their tour of the set. Despite being popular with many, the character of Pauline has also garnered much criticism over the years. Persistent criticism has been given to the character's dowdy attire, particularly the perception that she rarely wears anything but a baggy cardigan; a claim that Wendy Richard herself categorically disputes. In addition, Pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour‚Äî\\"a face like a month of wet weekends\\" and \\"a voice that could curdle milk.\\" She has been described as the \\"Wicked Witch of Walford\\" and \\"a character who became a byword for downtrodden haggery.\\" Lucy Mangan, the culture critic from The Guardian newspaper, summed up the character: \\"Pauline Fowler is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable ... She was presumably intended to be the anchoring force for EastEnders, but because of the writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show.\\" This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35th most annoying person of 2006 in a BBC Three poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list. In a Radio Times poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 13% chose Pauline Fowler as the soap character they would most like to see retired. She came third in the poll, behind EastEnders' Den Watts (17%) and Coronation Street's Ken Barlow (15%). Although it had been suggested that Pauline's presence in EastEnders was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike. In a report for BBC News, one viewer commented \\"it's so sad, because I've watched her for 20 years. She's such a large character\\", and another said \\"If she goes then I think EastEnders is finished.\\" BBC controller of continuing drama, John Yorke, commented Richard \\"occupies a huge place in people's hearts\\", and executive producer Kate Harwood said, \\"For many years Wendy simply was EastEnders for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the EastEnders' spirit ... We thank her for everything she has done for the show.\\" Inside Soap editor, Steven Murphy, said that the fact Pauline has been such an \\"enduring staple\\" will make it hard for fans to cope with her departure. \\"It's huge in soap terms ... She's a character people love to hate‚Äîyou just assumed she would be there forever.\\" When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: \\"characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [EastEnders] has very few of those now.\\" Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added \\"[Pauline's] an absolute legend ... You can't imagine the show without her ... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of EastEnders for so many years.\\" However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting \\"How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [getting rid of her]. Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago\\". Pauline's exit in December 2006 was described by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a \\"significant sayonara\\". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as \\"the most moving in a soap this year\\" and added that \\"it was a delight to finally alight on an episode ... that was so satisfying.\\" Conversely, Pauline's exit was described as a \\"mess\\" by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: \\"the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour-faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead.\\" To mark Pauline's 22-year reign in EastEnders, Wendy Richard was awarded with a 'Lifetime Achievement' award at the British Soap Awards in May 2007. The award was presented by Todd Carty, who played her on- screen son Mark. Carty described Richard as the \\"heart and soul of EastEnders\\" and hailed her as an inspiration to everyone in the EastEnders cast. Richard was moved to tears when she collected the award. In popular culture and other media When the series was launching in 1985, since Wendy Richard was the most recognisable actor from the original cast, she and her character Pauline were used heavily to promote EastEnders in the media.Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 120 Wendy Richard, in character as Pauline, was chosen to narrate a special \\"dial-a-soap\\" service for EastEnders. Run by British Telecom, the facility allowed people who had missed an episode to ring a number and get an instant update, up to 88 seconds long. It was the first television show to provide such a service.Smith, Julia; Holland, Tony p. 173 Between 1985 and 2006, Pauline was featured in much EastEnders-related merchandise and promotional material, including calendars, cast-cards, annuals, novels, a knitting pattern book and a greeting card.EastEnders Special The well-known character of Pauline Fowler has also been referenced in various television programmes, unrelated to the EastEnders universe. In 1997 she was mentioned in an episode of the successful BBC drama This Life. Two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watch an episode of EastEnders on television and mock Pauline's hysterics and her well-documented tendency to wear cardigans. The character was also regularly spoofed in the BBC comedy sketch show, The Real McCoy (1991‚Äì1995). One of the show's recurring sketches featured a spoof version of EastEnders, with black comedians taking over roles of well known EastEnders characters, who frequent a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian Llewella Gideon played the role of Pauline. The sketches placed considerable emphasis on the character's high-pitched voice and her tendency to whine. The character's fashion sense has also been referred to in BBC Two sitcom Beautiful People (2008).

OPSEU was established in 1975 as the successor union to the former Civil Service Association of Ontario, which was founded in 1911. In 1979, OPSEU affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress, the National Union of Public and General Employees, and the Ontario Federation of Labour. OPSEU is affiliated to several labour councils across Ontario. An OPSEU union hall in the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood of Toronto. The current president is Warren \\"Smokey\\" Thomas, who was first elected to the position in 2007. The labour expertise of President Thomas is recognised by his role as a faculty member in Employment Relations at Queen's University.https://mir.queensu.ca/index.cfm/students- faculty/faculty/warren-smokey-thomas/ Eduardo \\"Eddy\\" Almeida is the union‚Äôs First Vice-President/Treasurer. Membership and structure The union is structured into local occupational groups, units or locals. Most members of OPSEU work for the Ontario Public Service, municipal governments and services, and the public college system. Additionally, some members work for private companies or organizations that are contracted to provide a public service such as hospitals and medical laboratories. The list of bargaining units includes Colleges of Applied Arts & Technology - Academic (CAAT-A) with about 12,000 members, just under 10% of OPSEU's total membership, Colleges of Applied Arts & Technology - Support (CAAT-S), Hospital Professionals Division Central Provisions (HPD), Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC), Ontario Public Service (OPS). Other members include ambulance, developmental services, boards of education, children's aid societies, community agencies, long-term care, universities, hospital professionals, hospital support, municipalities, child treatment centres, municipal property assessment, mental health, Canadian Blood Services and Diagnostics. \\"OPSEU also represents members in many boards, Crown agencies, and tribunals, such as the Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal, the Ontario Pension Board, the Ontario New Democratic Party Caucus, the Ontario Teachers‚Äô Pension Plan Board, and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario.\\" In June, 2016, part-time support staff at all Ontario colleges held a vote on whether to join OPSEU. The College Employer Council blocked the counting of the ballots for more than a year, eventually losing. When the ballots were counted in January, 2018, 84% were in favour, leading to approximately 20,000 part-time support staff joining the union. OPSEU called this \\"the largest union organizing drive in Canadian history.\\" In October, 2017, part-time college faculty held a vote to join the union, but the results are not known because the College Employer Council is attempting to block the counting of the ballots. Strike history =Ontario Public Service strikes= The First Strike: 1996 In 1993, Ontario's first NDP government altered the legislation governing Ontario Public Service employees to allow them to strike. In 1996, Ontario Public Service employees struck legally (Correctional Officers struck illegally in 1979OPSEU History, 1970's - Page 2) for the first time in their history.OPSEU History, 1990's The strike was deeply political; OPSEU rallied against the Mike Harris government's proposed job cuts. The tension between the Government and OPSEU culminated on March 18, 1996 in a confrontation between the OPP and OPSEU strikers at Queen's Park in Toronto. Ontario Provincial Police riot control officers were called in to escort members of parliament who were being prevented from entering the legislature. MPPs were pelted with rocks and paper cups when they tried to cross the line. The confrontation escalated when police began to push through the line of protesters and violence erupted. At least half a dozen protesters were injured. 2002 The second strike between OPSEU and the provincial government lasted 54 days (March 13 to May 5) in 2002. Again, tensions between managers and the union were strong. Although there was no bloody confrontation between the union and the government during this strike, there was a strong division between union members and management. =College strikes, CAAT-A= 1984 College faculty were on strike from Oct. 16 until November 9, when they were legislated back to work. 1989 8,800 faculty members at Ontario's 22 community colleges went on strike on October 19, 1989. The strike ended on November 14 when OPSEU and the Ontario Council of Regents agreed to binding arbitration after back-to-work legislation was threatened. At the time, the average earnings of a teacher was about $47,000, and salaries ranged from $22,800 to $52,250. 2006 On March 7, 2006, roughly 9,100 faculty at Ontario's 24 colleges went on strike. Faculty returned to work on March 27 after 18 days on strike. At the time, full-time faculty had \\"a starting salary of about $32,000, an average pay of about $75,000 and a 16-year progression to reach top wage levels in their collective agreement, according to the union. The colleges offered a package that would have increased salaries by 12.6 per cent by the end of four years, taking the maximum pay to about $94,000. The union had proposed 12 per cent over three years.\\" 2017 On October 16, 2017, roughly 12,000 full-time faculty, partial load faculty, counsellors and librarians at the province's 24 Colleges went out on strike. The OPSEU collective bargaining team for the teachers was led by Warren Thomas and J.P. Hornick, Coordinator of the School of Labour at George Brown College.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/bathhouse-raids- pussy-palace-1.3647636https://www.dailyxtra.com/heritage-toronto-explores- lgbtq-history-this-summer-71249 Bill 178, the Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Labour Dispute Resolution Act, 2017 was successfully passed on Sunday, November 19, 2017, ending the strike and sending the parties to mediation and binding arbitration. Faculty members returned to work on November 20. Students resumed classes on November 21, 2017. The parties agreed to employ William Kaplan as mediator-arbitrator under the legislation. He published his decision on Dec. 20, 2017, and both sides appeared to be pleased with the result. The decision included a 7.75 increase in wages over four years and a one time lump sum payment for full and part-time staff. = Controversy, MacKay vs Thomas = On March 9, 2017, the Canadian newspaper, the Toronto Star published an article stating that OPSEU President Warren \\"Smokey\\" Thomas was 'accused of asking a community college president to fire a professor ‚Ä¶ according to allegations in a complaint to the Ontario Labour Relations Board'.Cohn, Martin Regg (2017-03-09). \\"OPSEU President Accused of trying to get rival fired\\". _The Toronto Star_. https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2017/03/09/opseu-president-accused-of- trying-to-get-rival-fired-cohn.html Retrieved 2019-03-05.

It is also referred to as the Smuggling Protocol. It is one of the three Palermo protocols, the others being the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children and the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition. The Smuggling Protocol entered into force on 28 January 2004. As of May 2020, the protocol has been signed by 112 parties and ratified by 149.Ratifications. The Protocol is aimed at the protection of rights of migrants and the reduction of the power and influence of organized criminal groups that abuse migrants. It emphasizes the need to provide migrants with humane treatment, and the need for comprehensive international approaches to combating people smuggling, including socio-economic measures that address the root causes of migration. The Protocol requires States Parties that have ratified to ensure that migrant smuggling (also called people smuggling) is criminalised in accordance with its terms, and those set out in the Convention on Transnational Organised Crime. Given the current political priority around people smuggling, it is perhaps surprising that a concerted international focus on defining and responding to migrant smuggling only occurred in the 1990s. This focus followed sharp rises in irregular migration to the United States, and to Europe in the 1980s and 90s.Gallagher and David, International Law of Migrant Smuggling, 2014, p1 A focus on those who facilitate irregular migration - rather than migrants themselves - was seen as a critical element of any response. The resulting legal framework was the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (Migrant Smuggling Protocol), that supplements the parent instrument, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.Gallagher and David, International Law of Migrant Smuggling, 2014, p1 The Migrant Smuggling Protocol does not provide a complete or self-contained legal regime but instead exists as part of a \\"dense web of rights, obligations and responsibilities drawn not just from the Protocol and Convention but also from the law of the sea, human rights law, and refugee law.\\"A.Gallagher and F.David, International Law of Migrant Smuggling, 2014, p2 Unlike human trafficking, people smuggling is characterized by the consent between customer and smuggler - a contractual agreement that typically terminates upon arrival in the destination location. However, smuggling situations can nonetheless in reality descend into situations that can best be described as extreme human rights abuses, with smuggled migrants subject to threats, abuse, exploitation and torture, and even death at the hands of smugglers (see for example, case studies in Gallagher and David, International Law of Migrant Smuggling, 2014, 9-10).

metal movement. They formed in 1979, disbanded 1988 and reformed in 2005. Their \\"Total Metal\\" approach is somewhere between fellow NWOBHM bands such as Mot√∂rhead and Venom, punk rock bands such as The Dickies, and early Exodus or Slayer. History =Moral Fibre= The roots of Atomkraft date to mid-1978, when Tony ‚ÄòDemolition‚Äô Dolan and Paul Spillett got together with the intention to form a band. Initially, going under the name of Moral Fibre and playing punk rock, they recruited guitarists Ian Legg and Chris Taylor. Ian Legg then left to be replaced by Sean Drew who also subsequently left. However the band continued to operate as a trio. =Atomkraft= On returning from a trip to Bremen, Germany, Taylor presented his band mates with some button badges featuring the environmental slogan 'Atomkraft, Nein Danke!' (Nuclear Power, No Thanks!) They liked the way the word \\"Atomkraft\\" sounded and so adopted it as the band name, believing it suits the new \\"metal\\" sound they pursued. In the endeavour for something more metal and less punk they got rid of Taylor. After trying out a couple of guitarists they settled on Steve White, whom Dolan knew from his art class at college. Another member of Dolan's art class, Mark Irvine, joined on bass. With Dolan on rhythm guitar and vocals and Spillett on drums the new line-up played four shows. Irvine's parents disapproved of his heavy metal image and lifestyle and so persuaded him to quit the band. Dolan switched back to bass and the band was able to continue. =Demon= In 1981, the band recorded the four song demo Demon at Impulse Studios, this being funded by Spillett who was the only one working at the time, and with the help of Keith Nicol. It was their first \\"proper\\" demo, although, the limitation of time and a two-track recorder gave results that were far from ideal. However, the band soldiered on, gaining experience by continuing to play live shows. =Total Metal= In early 1983, Atomkraft returned to Impulse Studios to record another demo. Learning from their previous experience they opted to record only two tracks for the Total Metal demo, featuring the title track and \\"Death Valley\\". White passed a copy of the demo to Sam Kress, who ran a radio station and Whiplash magazine. Kress liked the demo and promised to feature the band in his magazine. However, in late 1983, White left the band for personal reasons. Dolan was invited to stay with his sister in Canada to help out with her two children, while she was studying. With Dolan unemployed and the band effectively on hold, he decided to take her up on her offer. =Canada= In 1984, Spillett joined Dolan in Canada. The latter was further inspired when he got a copy of the magazine containing the write-up that Kress had promised. The write-up presented Atomkraft in a positive light and also featured Venom, Raven, Metallica, Anthrax and Megadeth. Spurred on by this, Spillett and Dolan began writing material and returned to England in late 1984 to search for a guitarist. They later fell out over a girl and went their separate ways. =Pour the Metal In= While visiting Neat Records to see if anyone could recommend a drummer, Dolan met Cronos of Venom who informed him that Ged Wolf (the brother of Venom's manager) was looking for a band having just left Tysondog. Dolan and Wolf got together and started auditioning for a guitarist. Finally a then 16-year-old guitar player, Rob Mathew, was recommended and this became the new Atomkraft line-up. The band began working on the new material that Dolan had been writing, and went on to record the Pour the Metal In demo at Neat Records Studio. It featured three tracks, \\"Pour the Metal In\\", \\"Burn in Hell\\" and \\"Carousel\\". The demo was sent to various fanzines and received a good response. Dave Woods of Neat Records heard the demo and offered them a deal, and the band started work on the Future Warriors album. =Future Warriors= Recorded over a couple of weeks and produced by Keith Nichol, Future Warriors was released in September 1985. Despite getting a poor review in Kerrang! magazine, other reviews were more positive and they got further requests for interviews. The band also opened for Slayer at The Marquee, where faulty equipment resulted in the band trashing the equipment in frustration after just three numbers. Despite this the band were asked to join the bill of the Venom/Exodus tour. =Queen of Death= After the end of the Venom/Exodus tour, Atomkraft prepared and recorded a new EP, with the tracks \\"Your Mentor\\" on the A-side and \\"Demolition\\", \\"Funeral Pyre\\" and \\"Mode III\\" on the B-side. The EP did not get released in this form, as a rift developed in the band as a result of discussions over management. Dolan subsequently left the band. Neat then released the track \\"Your Mentor\\" as part of the Powertrax promotional cassette, while the vocal tracks on the rest of the \\"Your Mentor\\" sessions were re-recorded by Ian Davison-Swift from Avenger. D.C. Rage (Darren Cook of Avenger) was brought in as bassist and two new tracks were recorded, with the new four-piece, \\"Queen of Death\\" and \\"Protector\\" (although Alan Hunter of Tysondog had originally contributed vocals to \\"Protector\\"). In October 1986, the re-titled Queen Of Death EP was released with the title track and \\"Protector\\" on the A-side, and \\"Demolition\\", \\"Funeral Pyre\\" and \\"Mode III\\" on the B-side. A re-recording of the track \\"Future Warriors\\", with Davison-Swift on vocals was also licensed for future inclusion in a compilation. With touring commitments lining up for the band, Dolan was invited to rejoin the band as rhythm guitarist, making Atomkraft a five piece outfit for their upcoming shows. =Conductors of Noize= The new line-up recorded the mini- album Conductors of Noize, which was released in July 1987, and then promoted the record as part of support to Agent Steel and Nuclear Assault. The first date of the tour, at the Hammersmith Odeon featured an expanded line-up of Max Penalty, Atomkraft, Onslaught, Nuclear Assault and Agent Steel, and was promoted as ‚ÄòThe Longest Day‚Äô. Atomkraft‚Äôs performance was filmed for the Live Conductors video as well as being recorded for a live BBC radio broadcast. They also played Dynamo Festival alongside Testament, Destruction and Stryper with the show going out live on Dutch radio. =Disbandment= The expanded five piece embarked on a 1988 European tour with Nasty Savage and Exumer ultimately resulting in a ‚Äòunique‚Äô gig (for the time) in Katowice, Poland, at Spodek Stadium. This show was recorded for live TV/video. On completion of the tour, the band folded in 1988. =Reformation= In 2004, Sanctuary Records (who had previously acquired the Neat Records back catalogue) released an Atomkraft anthology. With renewed interest in the band, Dolan reformed Atomkraft for live dates in 2005 and a possible new album. The 2005 line-up included Payre Hulkoff (from Swedish industrial band Raubtier) on guitar and Steve Mason on drums. However, this line-up did not release any new material. An EP of new material came out in 2011 on the Austrian underground label, W.A.R. Productions. Named Cold Sweat it contained three unreleased tracks recorded with members of the 2005 line-up and session musicians, plus a cover version of the Thin Lizzy track, \\"Cold Sweat\\", featuring Australian guitar player Joe Matera on guitar solo. Following the release of Cold Sweat, Dolan recruited a new line-up and did one date in London under the Atomkraft moniker in 2011, performing tracks from the new EP. The 2011 line-up included Kraen Maier and Rich Davenport on guitars, plus Paul Caffrey (from Gama Bomb) on drums. This line-up of Atomkraft (minus Rich Davenport) performed the Future Warriors LP in its entirety in March 2014 at the second edition of Brofest, a NWOBHM festival based in Newcastle upon Tyne. Former Venom guitarist Jeff Mantas appeared as a guest during the gig. A new compilation album, called Looking Back To The Future, was released in 2014 by Italian label Minotauro Records. It contained essentially unreleased demos and live tracks from every era of the band's history.

Built to fund the civic and philanthropic activities of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben, the thoroughbred race track was built in 1919, and the Coliseum in 1929. The racetrack closed in 1995 and the arena in 2002; the facility was demolished in 2005, and is currently being redeveloped for a variety of uses, including dormitory housing for the University of Nebraska Omaha and the Aksarben Village development. Ak-Sar-Ben is \\"Nebraska\\" spelled backwards. The Knights originally said they were turning Nebraska around, thus \\"Ak-Sar-Ben.\\" History =Coliseum= Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum was the premiere ice rink and concert arena in Omaha for more than 70 years. Popular acts ranging from Frank Sinatra to Elvis Presley to Nirvana all performed to sold-out crowds. It was also home to the Omaha Knights, a minor league hockey team from 1959 to 1975. The Knights began operations in 1959 in the IHL, and later moved to the now- defunct CHL, with teams affiliated with the NHL's Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers, and both the Calgary and Atlanta Flames. The arena hosted the USHL's Omaha Lancers for its final dozen years and the Omaha Racers basketball of the CBA from 1989 to 1997. The Coliseum also hosted world-class boxing, was a major stop on the PBR and attracted many popular comedians. =Horse racing= In the racetrack's glory days, the Coliseum housed a cinema-sized screen and betting windows to handle the overflow of fans. In the mid-1980s, Ak-Sar-Ben was tenth in the nation in racetrack attendance, with up to 25,000 betting $2 million per day on weekends. Punters came to the track from all around the Great Plains, as pari-mutuel betting was illegal in many of Nebraska's neighboring states such as Iowa, Missouri and Kansas. Many festivals were also held in the Coliseum annually, including a Greek Festival and River City Roundup booths. Following his death in 1959, the 1935 Triple Crown winner Omaha was buried at the racetrack's Circle of Champions. The thoroughbred spent his final nine years at a farm outside of Nebraska City and made promotional appearances at the Ak-Sar-Ben racetrack during the 1950s. Closure and demolition Horse racing at Ak-Sar-Ben ended in August 1995, just ten years after its record season of 1985. Greyhound and horse racing began in adjacent Iowa in 1986, the dogs would be legalized three years later in Kansas, and finally casino gambling began operations in Missouri in 1993: Ak-Sar-Ben's attendances never recovered, as gamblers who would previously travel to Omaha now had options closer to home. A portion of the property was sold to First Data Resources under the agreement that FDR would donate part of the land to the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO) for its Aksarben Campus to build a new College of Information and Technology.(nd) College of Information and Technology. After the remaining buildings and grandstand were torn down in early 2005, a proposal was put forth to create a mixed-use development called Aksarben Village.(nd) Aksarben Village. Retrieved 7/17/07. Construction began in 2006 and the first businesses opened in 2008.http://www.allbusiness.com/real-estate/commercial-residential-property- commercial/12149041-1.html Baxter Arena, home to several of UNO's sports teams, opened in October 2015.

The original Great Western Railway station was built here in 1856, on the same site as the current VIA and GO Stations. The Great Western Railway was purchased in 1882 by the Grand Trunk Railway, which was absorbed into the Canadian National Railway in 1920. Between 2009 and 2012, improvements on the Lakeshore West line added a third mainline track requiring the demolition of the Via Rail station and the construction a new fully accessible building.

History The original Great Western Railway station was built in 1855, just west of Brant Street, about half a mile west of the current GO Station. With the building of the Hamilton & Northwestern Railway in 1877, this location became a connection known as Burlington Junction. Coords: The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) purchased the Great Western Railway in 1882 and the Hamilton & Northwestern Railway/Northern Railway in 1888, and in turn was absorbed into the Canadian National Railway in 1923 That first station building burnt down in 1904 and was rebuilt in 1906. GO Transit rush hour service was launched in 1967 and the new station location opened in 1980, with the old station renamed Burlington West. Via Rail service, which followed to the GO Station in 1988, was discontinued in 1990. All day GO Transit service commenced in 1992. The City of Burlington acquired the 1906 historic station building in 2005. Renamed Freeman Station it had to be moved off site to allow for track improvements and with the purpose of having it restored.

As the terminal stop for evening rush-hour Lakeshore West line trains, it is a major hub for GO Transit bus and train services. The terminal is also served by intercity coach services, including Coach Canada. History Hamilton GO Centre is a Streamline Moderne building designed by New York architects Fellheimer & Wagner. It was planned as a large complex, but was reduced in size to that of a 7-storey office block. It opened in 1933 as the head office and the Hamilton station of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway (TH&B;). Passenger service on the TH&B; was discontinued on April 26, 1981, and the TH&B; merged into the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1987, leaving the facility disused. In the early 1990s, GO Transit provided service out of two facilities in Hamilton: trains were routed along the CN Grimsby subdivision to the Hamilton CNR Station 1.6 km to the north, and buses operated from an older bus station on the northern edge of Hamilton's Central Business District (CBD) at John Street North and Rebecca Street. In order to better connect GO Transit service to Hamilton's CBD, improve the interface with the Hamilton Street Railway, and consolidate train and bus services at a single site, renovations were undertaken to convert the TH&B; station into the Hamilton GO Centre. The new facility, designed by Garwood-Jones & Hanham Architects, opened on April 30, 1996. Hamilton Street Railway  On June 28, 2009, downtown bus routes were realigned and new bus platforms inside the GO Centre become the downtown terminus points for routes 1 King, 2 Barton and 3 Cannon. The seasonal route 51 University continued to stop inside the station's bus terminal. Many other Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) routes stop immediately adjacent to the Hamilton GO Centre, on Hunter, James, and John streets.  GO Transit  The GO station is served by GO's Lakeshore West line during peak hours; bus service to Aldershot Station in neighbouring Burlington is offered off-peak.

Old station It was the building of the first railway in Ontario in the 1850s between Hamilton and Toronto through what would become the Town of Mimico that led to the first plan for a town at this location. A Mimico Station was built on the north side of the tracks just south of Mimico's Christ Church (the first church in Etobicoke) on the east side of Church St (Royal York) at the end of Windsor Street.Currell, Harvey (1967). \\"The Mimico Story\\", Corporation of the Town of Mimico, Mimico, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Pg 42 This development meant the name Mimico became more associated with the area where the railway crossed the Mimico Creek to its station on Church St (Royal York) rather than the former Mimico at the Mimico Creek and the early Highway; Dundas. Nevertheless, the 1856 subdivision plan for Mimico largely failed and it was after the more successful 1890 plan for a Town at Mimico the 'old' Mimico Railway Station building, constructed by the Grand Trunk Railway was built in 1916 as well as the Windsor Hotel (Blue Goose Tavern). With the creation of the Government of Ontario's regional train GO service a new station was constructed on the site of the original 1856 Mimico Station, north of the tracks on the east side of Royal York just south of Christ Church. The 1916 Mimico Station deteriorated and was close to demolition when it was saved by community volunteers and moved to a new permanent location in Coronation Park at the northwest corner of Judson St and Royal York Rd in 2007. The building is now being restored with the intention of converting it into a local museum.

It is the successor to the RoboSapien robot and uses motion technology based on realistic biomechanics that give it fluid and natural movements. It has a multi-function remote control that uses infrared technology to talk to it. Unlike the original RoboSapien, the Roboraptor is capable of autonomous movement, using 3 realistic gaits.  Sensors  Roboraptor comes with several sensors that allow it to monitor and interact with its environment. It has infrared and stereo sound sensors on its head, and touch sensors on its chin, tail, and in the mouth allowing for more fun and interactive play.  Autonomous behaviors  It has four different modes of behavior or moods: hunting, cautious, playful, and free-roam. In hunting mode, it will react to sharp sounds and progressively focus its attention more intensely on repeated sounds coming from the same direction. In cautious mode, it will react oppositely and move away from sounds it hears. In playful mode, it will react to sounds in a more whimsical fashion but neither approaching nor avoiding them. In free-roam mode, it will explore its own environment, avoiding obstacles and stopping occasionally to listen for loud sounds to investigate. The Roboraptor does not walk well on carpets and cannot be programmed.  Flexible behaviors  When one touches one of Roboraptor's touch sensors, its reaction will vary depending on its mood. Touching its face when it is hunting will make it react angrily and most likely attempt to \\"attack\\" the person touching it. But if it is feeling playful, it will nuzzle the person's hand and then \\"attack\\", using its jaws.  Laser targeting  Early versions of the Roboraptor could also follow a laser-like target pointed on the ground. This could be used this to lead it around a room under direct control. However, this feature was removed from later units.  Mini Roboraptor  There is also a smaller version of Roboraptor available. However, it does not have a remote control or different modes of behavior. It is not an autonomous robot so much as it is a wind-up toy, though the smaller version does actually run on batteries. It is a smaller, cheaper, less functional Roboraptor. It walks at a single pace and it has a 'trigger' to make its mouth move, but it does not have any other sensors.

Date from: Circa 800 BC Date to: Circa AD 1800 (Iron Age to Medieval). Found by fieldwalking on cultivated land near Goole in Yorkshire, England. In archaeology or anthropology, a pot boiler is a heated stone used to heat water - typically by people who did not have access to pottery or metal vessels.  In Archaeology  The term refers to a stone used to move heat from a fire to a vessel to raise the temperature of water in the vessel, including for cooking. The stone is heated in a fire or in embers. When hot enough, the stone is transferred into a vessel of water to heat the contents. The vessel may be metal (though this is uncommon, metal normally being tough enough to take direct heat from a fire) or pottery which is not of good enough quality to be directly exposed to the heat of the fire \\\\- or a wooden trough. In a pre-pottery context, the heating can be done by lining a pit with leather, leaves or clay, and then putting in the water followed by pot boilers directly into the vessel. Such stones can be recognized because the repeated exposure to the heat of the fire followed typically by rapid chilling in water leads to great thermal stress on the stone's fabric due to the thermal expansion and contraction. This typically leads to partial glazing of the stone's surface and a fine network of cracks on the stone's surface (often described as \\"crazing\\"). Eventually the stone shatters. Individual fragments may be re-used until it becomes infeasible to manipulate the stone into and out of the fire, at which point the fragments are discarded and a new pot boiler (or many new ones) are acquired. Often the broken pot boilers are discarded into middens or domestic waste deposits, which on long-established sites can amount to many tonnes of material. Reuse as building material is not impossible, but the typical small size of the fragments hinders this use. = Identification = Surface \\"crazing\\" is not restricted to pot boilers - hearth stones and the surrounds of fireplaces may also show the same structure. However, since a pot boiler needs to be manipulated into and out of the fire (typically in anthropological observations, using sticks of green wood) at arm's length, they start off weighing up to several kilogrammes, and shrink by fragmentation ; hearth stones and chimney liners are typically larger.

The highway is currently known as Saint Rose Parkway, but was known as Lake Mead Drive prior to 2001. History View from the west end of SR 146 looking eastbound The original segment of SR 146 was known as State Route 41 (Lake Mead Drive) until the early-1980s. Originally, it was a route that began at the current western terminus at Interstate 15 and crossed Boulder Highway in Henderson before ending at the intersection of North Shore Road near Lake Mead. Construction of I-215 through southeast Las Vegas and Henderson altered the routing of SR 146. Clark County decided to build I-215 between Mile 6 (St. Rose Parkway/Pecos Road) and Mile 0 (the Interstate 515/U.S. Route 93/U.S. Route 95 interchange) on the SR 146 alignment. Since the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) does not co-sign state routes along Interstate highways, the decision was made in 1999 to officially truncate SR 146 to its current eastern terminus. The portion of the highway east of I-515/US 93/US 95 was recommissioned as State Route 564 (and has since been renamed Lake Mead Parkway).

Formerly carrying U.S. Route 91 (US 91), which had been the main highway between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, it has been bypassed by Interstate 15, and serves mainly local traffic with some sections designated State Route 604. Route description Las Vegas Boulevard runs the length of the Las Vegas metropolitan area in Clark County, Nevada. \\"The Boulevard\\", as it is sometimes called by longtime Las Vegas residents, starts at Apex, and continues south to about south of Jean, in the Mojave Desert. The Boulevard shows up again in Primm, Nevada, but is currently not connected to the northern sections. There are tentative plans to connect the existing section at Primm to the northern section at Jean. An aerial view of Las Vegas Boulevard as seen from atop Paris Las Vegas in 2012 Las Vegas Boulevard serves as the Valley's east/west address demarcation boundary line south of the Stratosphere onwards. The road's own north/south street address demarcation boundary is located at its intersection with Fremont Street. Unlike most other cases, where using the more traditional nomenclature of putting the direction before the road name is common practice, The Boulevard is an exception, as it is almost never referred to as \\"North Las Vegas Boulevard\\" and \\"South Las Vegas Boulevard\\". The road instead is usually referred to as \\"Las Vegas Boulevard North\\" (abbreviated LVBN) and \\"Las Vegas Boulevard South\\" (stylized LVBS), by both local residents and various media outlets. At its northern end in Apex, the Boulevard starts in an industrial complex of manufacturing plants and power plants running along the Union Pacific Railroad line. Traveling south, the road meets Nellis Air Force Base on the east side and the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on the west side. As the road enters the city of North Las Vegas, it passes through some of the older commercial areas in the region. As the road approaches the city of Las Vegas proper, some of what historical Las Vegas was becomes visible, as some of the older casinos appear along with some of the more famous and long-operating strip clubs. Upon entering the city limits of Las Vegas, the Boulevard showcases the area's past with a number of museums, including the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park, the Neon Museum, and the Fremont Street Experience and downtown casino sector. On crossing Washington Avenue, the Boulevard is designated as the Downtown Las Vegas Boulevard Scenic Byway by the state. This designation continues south to Sahara Avenue. Further south is a stretch of road that has many of the older motels, bars and wedding chapels that were among the high points of the old Vegas before the era of the megaresorts. =Las Vegas Strip= Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign, picture taken looking north up the strip in 2009 The Boulevard leaves the city of Las Vegas at Sahara Avenue and assumes its unofficial name the Las Vegas Strip for the next . This portion of Las Vegas Boulevard actually begins a few blocks to the north at the Stratosphere (the only major Strip hotel/casino actually sited within the Las Vegas city limits) and runs through Winchester and Paradise, with the Strip technically ending at Russell Road. This is the section of the road most people are familiar with; it is home to casino megaresorts with their world-famous lights, huge video signs and other attractions. It is designated as an All-American Road. Just past the end of \\"The Strip\\", the road passes the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign (located in the median) as it abuts the western edge of the McCarran International Airport property (the sign is often considered the de facto south end of the Strip, even though it is presently some distance from the nearest resort property. \\"South Strip\\" is now used to describe the section of Las Vegas Boulevard between Russell Road and Blue Diamond Road. Along this stretch, development thins out, except for newer shopping malls, hotels, resorts, casinos and condominiums (such as South Point Hotel & Casino and The Grandview at Las Vegas) as the Boulevard continues to travel south, just to the east of Interstate 15. After passing the M Resort, the Boulevard enters rural desert areas. It continues to parallel Interstate 15 and eventually arrives at Jean. South of Jean, the road ceases to be a major artery for a stretch of several miles before resuming just north of Primm, where it runs alongside two of the resort's hotels and shopping mall; just short of the Nevada/California state line, the road changes its name to Lotto Store Road and becomes a local road. Public transportation RTC Transit Route(s) 113 (and the MAX, before February 2016, when it was decommissioned) serves the road from Downtown Las Vegas north to Nellis Air Force Base, The Deuce serves the Road from Downtown Las Vegas south to Mandalay Bay (except from 12:30 am local time to 9:00 am local time where it continues further south to the South Strip Transfer Terminal (SSTT)). South of Circus Circus, alongside it runs the SDX (Strip & Downtown Express) which runs from 9am to 12:30am as a limited stop express line. Route 117 serves the road south from the SSTT past the Las Vegas Premium Outlet South store, the South Point Casino and Silverado Ranch Blvd. History Las Vegas Boulevard has had several names, including 5th Street (from Sahara to Owens, within the Las Vegas city limits), Main Street (in North Las Vegas), the Arrowhead Highway, Los Angeles Highway, Salt Lake Highway, US 91 (entire segment), US 93 (from Fremont Street north), US 466 (from Jean to Fremont Street, including the Las Vegas Strip) and State Route 6 (entire segment, unsigned). South of the city, Las Vegas Boulevard was commonly known as the Los Angeles Highway. Just north of JeanNevada Historical Marker 195 is the place where the last spike on the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad line was driven. With the construction of I-15, Las Vegas Boulevard went from being the main through road to one that only served as a city street for locals and tourists. Its current name, in effect since 1959, reflects its importance to the Valley rather than past names when it served as a main intra-city road. On October 16, 2009, the Federal Highway Administration announced the designation of a new National Scenic Byway on the boulevard. The section starting at Sahara Avenue and running north to Washington Avenue was designated the City of Las Vegas, Las Vegas Boulevard State Scenic Byway.

It is a stop on the Lakeshore East line and was the eastern terminus from 1967 until 1990, when service was extended to Whitby and subsequently to Oshawa. History GTR station Pickering The previous Pickering station, which had been constructed by Grand Trunk Railway in the early 1900s, had been about 2 kilometres east of the current location at Liverpool Road. Plans for the original GO Transit Lakeshore line called for commuter train service not to go beyond Liverpool Road where the CN York Subdivision tracks joined the CN Kingston Subdivision, because this would interfere with freight trains. No practical site could be found, but there was a large field south of the tracks on the east side of Liverpool Road with more than enough space to accommodate a station building, bus terminal and car parking, with convenient access from Bayly Street. Installation of a new crossover before the overpass at Liverpool Road was required to get to an existing industrial track, so that GO Trains standing at the station platform would be off the main line. When the station opened in 1967 it was a key transfer point between train and bus services. In 1990 the single platform was supplement by two more platforms and tracks when GO Transit built a dedicated right-of-way on the north side of the Canadian National tracks. This was part of the project to expand Lakeshore East train service to Ajax and Whitby, and finally to a new terminus at the Oshawa Via Rail station in 1995. Station layout Pickering has three platforms for trains, 1 and 2 which serve trains to Union and trains to Oshawa. Track 3, separated from the other tracks, is closest to the bus bays and station. Track 3 is the original track before the extension to Oshawa, which serves Express and Local trains to and from Union which terminate in Pickering. A pedestrian walkway (to eliminate need for passengers to cross CN tracks to travel from the station to the bus terminal) was completed in 2012, and a new multi-level parking structure is being built at the station and will be completed by spring/summer 2014 with an expected capacity of 1500 new parking spaces. Exterior cladding of the bridge in a metallic mesh proved to be problematic and, along with severe weather, delayed its completion.

The station is situated on the CN Kingston Subdivision. It is a stop on the Lakeshore East line and also for intercity Via Rail Corridor services running from Toronto to Ottawa and Montreal. History The station was opened on April 4, 1967 by the Canadian National Railway, with GO Transit following a month later. Intercity services passed to Via Rail in 1979. The station was meant to provide an easy connection to Toronto Transit Commission buses along Kingston Road, as well as car parking. Since the commuter train service was initially only a demonstration, the land close to the overpass, and the bus stop, could not be acquired due to the cost. This resulted in quite a long walk for pedestrians using local transit. The station has long served as (Metro) Toronto's secondary intercity rail station, providing a second option for Via riders traveling through Toronto alongside the busier Toronto Union Station. In May 2018, both platforms were closed at the west end for constructing more tunnels on the west platform, and further station building upgrades. GO Trains only opened the five east-end coaches of each train. Construction was completed on July 3, 2019.

It is the terminal station for the Lakeshore East line of GO Transit and serves Via Rail's Corridor service, which travels from Toronto to both Ottawa and Montreal. The bus terminal is served by bus routes of GO Transit and Durham Region Transit. History Old CNR station The Grand Trunk Railway between Montreal and Toronto was completed in 1856 and the first Oshawa station was located on the north end of Albert Street. In 1923 the Grand Trunk was absorbed by the Canadian National Railway who, in the 1960s, built a single-floor station with a flat roof on the same spot. The CN station was demolished shortly after when GO Transit built their Oshawa station as their eastern terminus to the west of the original station's location. The building was expanded and upgraded by Via Rail in the early 1990s and GO Transit's Lakeshore East line was extended to there in 1995. On November 24, 2017, the modernization of the Oshawa GO Station was completed and opened to the public. It was announced 2 years earlier as a joint project between Via Rail and Metrolinx, the province's public transit agency. The CAD$14 million projects included upgrades to the modern ticketing counter, a waiting area with bigger public washrooms, and a pedestrian bridge to the Via platform which made it easier for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists to access the station. Via Rail The station is regularly served by intercity trains on the Corridor routes between Toronto and Montreal or Ottawa. In 2009 Via Rail announced the planned construction of a new fully accessible station adjacent to the existing building as part of major improvements to the Kingston Subdivision, the main line between Toronto and Dorval.

This is the only terminal station in the GO transit system located at the actual end of line trackage. There are GO bus connections serving Courtice, Bowmanville, Newcastle and Peterborough to the east, and to the west, serving Whitby, Ajax, Pickering, Scarborough and Toronto, via Highway 2 and/or Highway 401. GO Transit plans to cease services to the station when it extends services to Bowmanville, replacing it with three new stations (with plans for a future potential fourth station). Durham Region Transit Durham Region Transit serves the city of Oshawa and surrounding cities such as Whitby, Port Perry, Ajax, Pickering and Clarington. DRT tickets pass, and transfers are accepted on GO buses operating within Durham Region, allowing riders to freely transfer between DRT and GO buses to complete a trip within the region. DRT also has in place a co-fare (reduced fare) system for riders transferring from GO Transit.

It was in the possession of Thomas of Woodstock, a son of King Edward III of England, until his death in 1391, when it reverted to the Crown. Caldicot Estate Caldicot is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, not for its castle, but as an agricultural holding of Durand of Gloucester, Sheriff of Gloucestershire. Walter FitzRoger, Durand's nephew, inherited his lands as well as his father's office of Constable of England which remained with the lords of Caldicot. Walter's son Milo was granted the Earldom of Hereford to add to his titles. In the time of Henry I of England the castle was probably a simple motte-and-bailey. Charles W.C. Oman, Castles: An illustrated guide to 80 castles of England and Wales, Beekman House, 1978 Printing, Bohun family Milo's five sons died childless so his eldest daughter, Margaret, took to her marriage with Humphrey II de Bohun the Earldom of Hereford, the Constableship of England, and Caldicot. Their son Humphrey III de Bohun was the probable builder, in about 1170, of the stone keep and curtain walls of the present-day castle.Charles W.C. Oman, Castles: An illustrated guide to 80 castles of England and Wales, Beekman House, 1978 Printing, The Bohun family held the manor and castle of Caldicot for more than two centuries, over eight generations. Thomas of Woodstock In 1376 the manor, along with 70 others, passed to Thomas of Woodstock, the third son of King Edward III of England, when he married Alianore de Bohun. On the death of Edward III the throne passed to his grandson, the nine-year-old Richard II. As the new king's uncle, Thomas played an important role advising him. He was appointed Constable of England. He rarely visited Caldicot, his main estates being at Pleshey in Essex, close to the seat of power. In 1381, however, Essex was convulsed by the Peasants' Revolt. This may be why Thomas decided to spend part of that year in Caldicot. During his stay he gave orders for major new work to be done on the castle. A new gatehouse and drawbridge were constructed. At the rear of the castle a dovecote was replaced by a new tower with private chambers, now known as the Woodstock tower. At the foot of the Woodstock tower two carved stones were to be placed, one marked 'Thomas' the other 'Alianore'. As time passed relations between Thomas and King Richard grew increasingly strained. In 1391, on the orders of the king, Thomas was kidnapped and murdered. His property was confiscated and passed into the hands of the Crown. House of Lancaster In 1399 Henry Bolingbroke seized the throne from Richard, and although Mary de Bohun did not live to see her husband crowned Henry IV, her son, born at Monmouth Castle, would be one of the country's great heroes, Henry V, victor of Agincourt. The division of the de Bohuns estates was revised after the death of Alianore and Mary de Bohun's mother Joan, who had outlived both of her daughters by some twenty years. Alianore's eldest daughter and heir, Anne, lost Caldicot to Mary's son King Henry V, and so Caldicot became part of the great Duchy of Lancaster. Held by Henry's widow, Katherine of Valois, Caldicot was later granted into the stewardship of the Herbert family for much of the fifteenth century, and then leased in the sixteenth century to their successors the Somersets with their power base at Raglan. Decline, neglect and restoration Caldicot Castle was evidently neglected, fell into ruin and became little more than a farmyard. The castle was sold to Charles Lewis of St Pierre in 1857. In 1885 he sold it to Joseph Richard Cobb, who began the restoration of the castle as his family home.Welsh Country Homes: Caldicot Castle (2) The Cardiff Times, 12 November 1910, at Welsh Newspapers Online, National Library of Wales From 1885 to 1964, the Cobb family owned the castle. Joseph Cobb's family remained at the castle after his death and it was his son Geoffrey Wheatly Cobb, and in particular his daughter-in-law Anna, who continued the work of restoration. In the early twentieth century, many rooms were decorated with memorabilia from Nelson's first flagship, HMS Foudroyant which was owned by G. Wheatly Cobb at the end of its life. G. Wheatly Cobb died in 1931 and, after Anna's death in 1943, the castle passed to Joseph's grandson, Geoffrey Cobb who created furnished apartments for renting in three of the towers and also in parts of the gatehouse. In 1964, Chepstow Rural District Council bought the castle from the Cobb family for ¬£12,000, at a time when the increasing availability of council housing had supplanted the local need for the castle apartments. The building, including a small museum, was opened to the public in 1965. After 1967, medieval-style banquets were held there.Thomas T.

On occasion other artists and writers have contributed to the series, including Katie Bair, Fred Perry, Robby Bevard, Carlos Castro, and Fabian Doles. NHS takes place in a suburban town known as Quagmire, located \\"somewhere in the Midwest\\". The series originally centered on the misadventures of Jeremy Feeple, a 16-year-old boy attending Quagmire High School; an alien princess named Asrial from a planet called Salusia; and a young female ninja named Ichi-kun Ichihonei, from Japan. As the series progressed, more backstory was given to the main characters, and a large cast was created. Most of the cast are manga archetypes of varying degrees. NHS started out as a limited series that mainly parodied famous anime and manga conventions. (Rumiko Takahashi's Urusei Yatsura appears to be the main influence, although the title \\"Ninja High School\\" was commonly used in the 1980s to refer to Fujihiko Hosono's series Sasuga no Sarutobi, which was actually about a high school for ninja students.) Later story arcs became more serious, delving into murder, drugs, and other more mature subjects. After its initial four-issue run, the comic was popular enough to become a full series, currently totaling over 160 issues (as well as two limited series, Ninja High School V2 and Quagmire USA and the color limited series The Prom Formula). There were also two-issue furry parodies, Furry Ninja High School and Furry Ninja High School Strikes Back. Fan-contributed editions of the series include the Ninja High School Yearbook and Ninja High School Swimsuit Edition. While not reaching great heights in critical or financial success, Ninja High School is one of few successful, long running manga-styled comics produced in America. It has contributed greatly to their continuing saturation of the American comics market.

During the period Eternity was publishing the title, the company published several NHS limited series and spin-offs, including a two-issue intercompany crossover with NOW Comics' Speed Racer in 1993. When Eternity shut down, Antarctic Press took over publication of NHS starting with an issue #0 in May 1994. Resuming the numbering with issue #40, Antarctic published 137 issues, ending with issue #175 in August 2009. Story continuity was \\"reset\\" three times, between issues #57 and #58, issues #74 and #75, and issues #129 and #130.Ninja High School (Antarctic Press 1994 series), Grand Comics Database. Accessed Jan. 2, 2020. During this period, NHS crossed over with its fellow Antarctic Press title, Gold Digger; Antarctic has since published many associated one-shots and limited series. Issue #74 (publication date April 2000) of the original series completed the Jeremy storylines, and in 1999‚Äì2000, Antarctic published a twelve-issue NHS Volume 2, focusing on Jeremy's younger brother, Ricky. Set four years after Ninja High School #74; Volume 2 reset continuity so that Ninja High School #1-74 took place in 1989, not 1986. NHS Volume 2, therefore (as well as all issues of NHS after issue #75+) took place in the 1990s. From issue #101 to #126, the comic was written and drawn by Katie Bair (with assists from Robby Bevard), had a title change (shortened) to just NHS, returned to black and white, and the setting changes to Hawaii. The only major character who carried over from the previous cast was Yumei Katana. This run was later collected into individual volumes under the new title, Ninja High School: Hawaii. From #127 to #129, the comic was cooperatively developed by Fred Perry and Ben Dunn to transition from the Hawaii storyline back to the Quagmire location. The focus returned to the Volume 2 cast. In #130, Ricky Feeple returns to the spotlight, in what, after the events of the second \\"Quagmire US\\" miniseries, may or may not be an alternate timeline. From here the version was dubbed Shidoshi by Antarctic Press to separate it from the original series. The Shidoshi series ran eight issues, and a new version of NHS was planned focusing on a new batch of characters. Plot The story centers on Jeremy Feeple, an ordinary student at Quagmire High, living an ordinary life. Shortly into the story, a beautiful female ninja named Itchy Koo (real name Ichikun Ichinohei) and an alien princess named Asrial appear. The earlier stories focus on the girls' comedic attempts to marry this seemingly plain, ordinary high school boy. The series plot started rather simply: Princess Asrial was sent to Earth to find Jeremy Feeple and marry him, an act that was described as required to ensure that their enemies do not lay claim to the planet. Since Earth was a non-aligned world, anyone could claim it, and the Salusians were desperate to keep it from being used against them. Ichi went to America to marry Jeremy as well, although her reasons for the trip were different, in order to become leader of her clan, her grandfather informed her that she had to marry the boy, the reason behind this is that Jeremy's mother was raised by this grandfather, and they wanted to be blood related. Unfortunately, shortly after landing, Asrial, Ichi, and Jeremy Feeple get caught up in a whirlwind of comic mischief, fighting, and plots by local villains to take over the planet. The comic often features parody versions of other comics or television shows, usually Japanese, but occasionally European or American, such as Kamen Rider, Power Rangers, Ultraman, Harry Potter, Superman, The Powerpuff Girls, Terminator, Robocop, Ninja Gaiden, Transformers, Fist of the North Star, and the Gundam series. Later the series does a time skip and focus on Jeremy's little brother, Ricky Feeple (who was mostly a minor character in the first series), as he enters high school himself, gaining new friends and soon coming into conflict with a rival ninja clan known as Shidoshi who set their sights on destroying him. While the comic still retained its comedic tones, it also ventured into darker territory and has a bit more drama thrown in than the original NHS. * The V2 spinoff has little to do with the actual storyline, although several main characters are used in the plot. It was created by Ben Dunn because it gave him the ability to tell stories he never got a chance to do with the original cast of characters. Furthermore, it allowed him to update the NHS timeline a bit. * Between issues 75 to 100, the storyline departed from the main line and started focusing on Ricky Feeple and his temporal trips to alternate timelines on a bid to save the universe from being destroyed. In this time, Asrial had been seen to have left Earth for Salusia on important yet unknown business at that time. Eventually the universe is saved. * Asrial's return to Earth following her trip came included with two children named Kassy and Lexus. Their age at introduction places them as at least 6 to 8 years old. As they are Salusian in appearance, Jeremy believes Asrial married someone else, however, when they call Jeremy \\"daddy\\", Asrial admits to Jeremy he is their father. It is then assumed that the reason Asrial left was because Jeremy impregnated her and thought it safer to raise them on Salusia in a more stable environment. Likewise, this time gap could be explained by the temporal hopping Ricky did in his efforts to save the universe. This is the first time that the connection between Jeremy and Asrial has been confirmed as mutually romantic although there may be earlier evidence of this romantic and violent interest in earlier issues. A point ending the first run was when Ichi-Kun reveals her first pregnancy, which is in conjunction with Asrial's third pregnancy, but with a note saying the series would continue at a later date. * Jeremy gets involved at least twice in Salusian affairs, one time by accident, in which he manages to uncover some secret plots to bring the Salusian Conglomerate to ruin. Information of this is sketchy at best. Main characters To the left, the original main characters, Asrial, Jeremy, and Ichi-kun. To the right the current cast, centred around Ricky Feeple * Jeremy Feeple: A mild-mannered teenage boy attending Quagmire High School, generally described in the series as average in everything. Though he has not trained as extensively in the ninja arts as his younger brother Ricky, it is revealed later in the series that he does possess some stealth and infiltration skills. When Asrial shows up to marry him, mass mayhem ensues as another suitor and local events turn his world inside out. In the beginning, it was thought that Ichi would marry him, to the point that a character was seen in early issues who was from a future in which they did marry, but he eventually falls in love with Asrial and marries her instead, negating that reality. He is also the father of their three children. Despite being the star of the first series of adventures, Jeremy does not seem to follow in the footsteps of his mother Anna, and is instead among the more 'normal' members of the cast, though he is shown to be courageous and willing to fight for friends and loved ones. * Ichi-kun Ichinohei: The granddaughter of the head of the Ichinohei clan. Ichi came to Quagmire due to a prearrangement with Anna Feeple a former member of the Ichinohei clan. Her goal was to have Jeremy marry her so that she could take over the clan, however she was soon caught up in the general Quagmire craziness. Ichi can be aggressive, and very to the point, though she is a very sweet girl. Ichi was always thought of to be the one who would marry Jeremy, this did not come true. Ichi eventually married Rivalsan Lendo, and the two were last seen to be expecting their first child. Ichi, like Asrial, at one point was genuinely enamored with Jeremy, though she later came to love Lendo. Unlike Jeremy, Ichi-kun- who was also sometimes referred to as \\"Itchy koo\\" as a nickname by others in the cast- was fully competent in martial arts, as she was trained in ninjutsu by the Ichinohei clan, and often fought with Asrial over Jeremy as much as she did actual threats to the lives of all three characters during their time in the spotlight as the primary characters of the series. * Asrial: A Salusian (race of humanoid skunks) Princess hailing from the planet Salusia. In order to avoid detection on Earth, she was transformed by a scientist into a human girl with long blonde hair, though she retained her skunk-like ears atop her head. She has superhuman strength and great intelligence, however her attitude is the antithesis of Ichi-kun in that she is more reserved and less prone to headstrong decisions; likely due to her royal upbringing. She was ordered to marry Jeremy in order to cement an alliance between Salusia and Earth, which led to a rivalry with Ichi-kun. However, her determination to marry Jeremy was not solely on orders, but because she had genuinely fallen in love with him. Ultimately Asrial marries Jeremy, and gives birth to a set of boy-girl fraternal twins. She later gives birth to a third child; another daughter. * Ricky Feeple: Jeremy's brother, who finds himself jealous of all the attention that Jeremy gets, among other issues. Ricky becomes one of the primary protagonists of the Shidoshi arc of Ninja High School, showcasing his martial arts talent, gained from training with his mother. He ends up married at the end of Shidoshi and he and his wife are currently expecting the birth of their first child. * Yumei Katana: A ninja whose family married into the Rivalsans and along with Ricky one of the two rivals of Tetsuo Rivalsan, she eventually moved to Hawaii where she was beset by suiters, blind samurai, and the children of gods. Yumei serves as the protagonist of the Hawaii arc. * Rivalsan Lendo: The head of the Rivalsan Ninja Corporation's US branch. Lendo has had a childhood crush on Ichi-kun, and had followed her to Quagmire when she moved from Japan. Lendo tried to foil Kudasai's prearrangement by kidnapping Jeremy. After his plan failed, Lendo tried to leave, but was stopped by his father. Thus, he was stuck in Quagmire until he could improve the profitability of its RNC branch. Rivalsan became a recurring character, fitting the rich but arrogant type. The name Lendo is basically a take on that of Shuutarou Mendou from Urusei Yatsura. * Anna Feeple: Jeremy Feeple's mother. She's a wizened woman who used to be a martial artist and heir to a dojo before she married Jeremy's father and settled down into retirement. * Robert Feeple: Jeremy Feeple's father. He is an exterminator who was once hired by Ichi-kun's grandfather to rid the dojo of rats, which led to his chance meeting with Anna that ultimately resulted in their marriage. He is seen in two flashbacks, one where Anna explains that in order to leave the clan to marry, she had to promise Jeremy to the clan's first daughter, then with Jeremy at a very young age where he is explaining he must go off and kill many rodents, but will not be returning due to too many chemicals. Although this strongly suggested Mr. Feeple took his own life, it was later revealed he is now living in a faraway kingdom, as in a later issue Jeremy is reunited with his father. * Professor Johann Steamhead (Steamhein): German-born Jew who was expelled from his homeland in the early 1930s, just as he was beginning his science career. A devout scientist, Steamhein had a passion for harnessing the wonders of steam. His inventions were already known in the field of animal control when he came to America. He'd made a friendship with Jeremy and Ricky's grandfather long before he became a teacher at Quagmire High School. Before leaving Germany; Professor Johann Steamheinn was a colleague of Professor Hossenfeffer. Due to a disagreement about something, they have not been on speaking terms ever since. It should also be mentioned that Professor Steamhead is the inventor of Zetranite; the substance that gives the Zetramen their powers. * May (Tomorrow Girl): Modeled after Supergirl, Tomorrow Girl is a superhero who makes several appearances. She is not an alien however, but instead a synthoid, a kind of artificial construct designed to resemble a human down to the cell structure. Originally, May came from a future where an artificial intelligent race has enslaved mankind. She was sent to the present to bring back Jeremy, as his capture was crucial for the survival of that race. She and her adopted 'father' Tomorrow Man both defend the city of Quagmire. May dated Ricky Feeple for a time during the early issues of Shidoshi, though their relationship did not last and various events throughout the arc kept them apart to the point that by the time they had encountered one another again, Ricky was married and had completed his ninja training. * Arnie: An incredibly strong man. Early on, he defeated Lendo's bodyguard Kenterminator. Good friends with Jeremy and the gang, he was an older brother/guardian figure. He later was the leader of a group of teen heroes whom Ricky Feeple was a member of. * Kaiju Akaru: Jeremy's rival for Ichi's affections (or so he would like to think) Akaru came from a small pacific island named Guri-guri. As a child he had received a letter in a bottle from a girl wishing for a friend‚ÄîIchi. When Akaru got older he left Guri-guri island and sought out to find Ichi with one goal: to make her his bride. Akaru arrived in Quagmire with his squid, Sigmund. He first ran into Asrial after picking fruit from her tree. After a quick encounter, Akaru was sent on his way with one of Asrial's fist. Later after meeting Ichi; Akaru decided to take her back by force. Ichi was saved by Asrial and Jeremy. However, after disabling Asrial's Vette, it was then reduced to a fight between Jeremy and Akaru. Jeremy was definitely not in his best form, as Akaru was stronger and a much better fighter (tempered by his lifestyle in the wild). With the quick intervention of Asrial and a Salusian Power Drink (akin to steroids) the fight was quickly put to an end. Afterwards Akaru decided to stay and learn of this new place. * Kalen: Asrial's older half-brother. Kalen was born from a union between King Jerka and an unknown lover. Kalen was a member of the ISC, however a falling out with his father led to a rift that has never quite been resolved. Kalen soon after became a pirate and recipe connoisseur. Kalen has always had a close relation to Asrial, and has constantly fought on the forces of good. Kalen's role in the intergalactic war between Zardon and Salusia was key in Salusia's victory as he had assisted in the escape of Asrial when captured by Zardonian Princess Leanna. Kalen was also selected by Asrial to watch over her daughter Kassy when it was deemed necessary for her safety. Currently Kalen's whereabouts are unknown, but he has added Solara to his crew. * Kudasai Ichinohei: Kudasai is the head of the Ichinohei Clan from the beginning of the series. He appears short and vulnerable, but is able to reveal a stunningly buff physique by just taking off his shirt. In the spring of 1945 Kudasai Ichinohei crash landed somewhere in Russia. There he gained the trust of a young Russian woman named Tasha. Though their initial first encounter was a scare for the both of them. Tasha would help Kudasai gather the equipment to repair his plane so that he could leave. However some Russian soldiers tried to attack Tasha, and she was shot in the process. Tasha begged Kudasai to take her daughter Anna with him. Kudasai raised Anna along with his son. After Japan has surrendered on August 10, 1945, America occupied the country. A military officer named Jerome Feeple came to help during Americas occupation by exterminating rats and bringing in food. Kudasai and Jerome became great friends. Soon the two began a small toy making company. Rivalsan Kenjo came along to help run the business. Though a disagreement would cause him to leave and form the infamous R.N.C. As time passed Kudasai would reestablish his clan, leading the Ichinohei's to the forefront of ninja-dom.

This article details the major Canadian allocations changes under NARBA. The principal reason for Canada in entering the NARBA negotiations was to gain more clear-channel allocations for Canadian stations, particularly for the CBC, which at that time was both Canada's public broadcaster and also its broadcasting regulator. Up to that point, these allocations had been dominated by commercial stations from the United States. Canada had only six clear- channel frequencies: 540, 690, 730, 840, 910, and 1050, of which 540, 730, and 910 were shared with Mexico, and 1050 was shared with the United States. The result of the treaty for Canada was to add new clear-channel allocations at 740, 990, and 1010; with the expansion of the AM band to 1605 kHz, Canada would later add 1580. Most stations throughout North America were minimally affected by the allocations changes. Their channels simply moved up (or in a few cases down) the dial to a new frequency which was shared (or not) with the same stations as were there before. Major Canadian cities, however, saw more changes, as the creation of the three new clear channels invited a reshuffle of channels among the existing broadcasters. (No new Canadian stations were licensed as a part of this process.) The major changes were as follows: * In the Maritimes, CBA in Sackville, New Brunswick moved from 1050 to 1070. There were (and are) no other clear-channel stations in the Maritimes. * In Quebec, all of the important stations were located in Montreal. CKAC on 730 remained unchanged. CBF moved from 910 (which would have become 940) to 690, paving the way for CBM to move from 960, a regional channel, to clear-channel 940. * In Ontario, changes were again limited to the largest city, Toronto. CBL moved from 840 (which would have become 860) to the new clear, 740. This allowed CFRB to move from 690 to 860, freeing up 690 for use in Montreal. * In Manitoba, Winnipeg's CKY moved from 910 to 990. (The channel would eventually be taken over by the CBC.) * In Alberta, CJCA in Edmonton moved from clear channel 730 to regional channel 930. (This would make it possible for the CBC to later build CBX in Edmonton on 740 kHz.) In Calgary, CFCN moved from 1030 to 1010; that channel would also eventually be taken over by the CBC. * In British Columbia, Vancouver's CBR moved from 1100 to 1130, both secondary assignments on a U.S. clear channel. (It would only later move to 690, opening up the 1130 allocation for a commercial station in Vancouver.)

Zobrist hashing is named for its inventor, Albert Lindsey Zobrist.Albert Lindsey Zobrist, A New Hashing Method with Application for Game Playing, Tech. Rep. 88, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, (1969). It has also been applied as a method for recognizing substitutional alloy configurations in simulations of crystalline materials. Calculation of the hash value Zobrist hashing starts by randomly generating bitstrings for each possible element of a board game, i.e. for each combination of a piece and a position (in the game of chess, that's 12 pieces √ó 64 board positions, or 16 x 64 if a king that may still castle and a pawn that may capture en passant are treated separately for both colors). Now any board configuration can be broken up into independent piece/position components, which are mapped to the random bitstrings generated earlier. The final Zobrist hash is computed by combining those bitstrings using bitwise XOR. Example pseudocode for the game of chess: constant indices white_pawn := 1 white_rook := 2 # etc. black_king := 12 function init_zobrist(): # fill a table of random numbers/bitstrings table := a 2-d array of size 64√ó12 for i from 1 to 64: # loop over the board, represented as a linear array for j from 1 to 12: # loop over the pieces table[i][j] := random_bitstring() function hash(board): h := 0 for i from 1 to 64: # loop over the board positions if board[i] ‚â† empty: j := the piece at board[i], as listed in the constant indices, above h := h XOR table[i][j] return h Use of the hash value If the bitstrings are long enough, different board positions will almost certainly hash to different values; however longer bitstrings require proportionally more computer resources to manipulate. The most commonly used bitstring (key) length is 64 bits. Many game engines store only the hash values in the transposition table, omitting the position information itself entirely to reduce memory usage, and assuming that hash collisions will not occur, or will not greatly influence the results of the table if they do. Zobrist hashing is the first known instance of tabulation hashing. The result is a 3-wise independent hash family. In particular, it is strongly universal. As an example, in chess, each of the 64 squares can at any time be empty, or contain one of the 6 game pieces, which are either black or white. That is, each square can be in one of 1 + 6 x 2 = 13 possible states at any time. Thus one needs to generate at most 13 x 64 = 832 random bitstrings. Given a position, one obtains its Zobrist hash by finding out which pieces are on which squares, and combining the relevant bitstrings together. Updating the hash value Rather than computing the hash for the entire board every time, as the pseudocode above does, the hash value of a board can be updated simply by XORing out the bitstring(s) for positions that have changed, and XORing in the bitstrings for the new positions. For instance, if a pawn on a chessboard square is replaced by a rook from another square, the resulting position would be produced by XORing the existing hash with the bitstrings for: 'pawn at this square' (XORing out the pawn at this square) 'rook at this square' (XORing in the rook at this square) 'rook at source square' (XORing out the rook at the source square) 'nothing at source square' (XORing in nothing at the source square). This makes Zobrist hashing very efficient for traversing a game tree. In computer Go, this technique is also used for superko detection. Wider usage The same method has been used to recognize substitutional alloy configurations during Monte Carlo simulations in order to prevent wasting computational effort on states that have already been calculated.

There is no lower limit. Investment clubs provide members a means to learn about markets, while meeting and working with people who have similar interests.  History  Although people have been investing in groups for thousands of years, the world's first investment club was allegedly established in Texas in 1898 back in the days of the Wild West when few investments could be considered safe. Investment clubs were seen as an ideal way of spreading the risk ‚Äì away from just cattle. While the first investment club on record dates back to the 1800s in Western America, Various online communities devoted to this type of investing have recently emerged and have contributed to the personal investing boom in the United States. One of the reasons that people come together in investment clubs is to learn how to invest. In Britain investment clubs took off in the 1950s, but the rate of formation fell at the time of the 2008 financial crisis.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/shares/10698532/Is- it-last-orders-for-investment-clubs.html  Starting an Investment Club  Industry observers recommend prospective members adhere to these guidelines: *Consult a tax adviser on the taxation implications of the club's selected legal structure *Establish an investment mission, policy and goals that allow active participation before investing *Draw up a written operating or membership agreement covering asset management rules and membership changes *Evaluate fees for different tools and platforms to maximize returns.Starting an Investment Club,\\"\\" *Focus on learning and making money.  Club Types  = High School Extracurricular Investment Clubs = This form of investment club usually meets to develop interest in investing and the intricacies of investing for minors, usually high school students. They typically are led by an adult who has vast experience in professional investing. = Stock, Mutual Fund or Bond Investment Clubs = These clubs are groups of people that pool their money to purchase stocks, stock options, mutual funds or bonds. Many clubs are educational in nature with objectives in line with learning how to make smart long-term investments. The National Association of Investors Corporation is a non-profit organization of many investment clubs with this purpose. These clubs may decide to buy or sell investments typically based on a majority votes. Club objectives do vary and in the U.S. the Securities and Exchange Commission may require that a club be registered depending on the intent of investment. The SEC distinguishes between clubs on the basis of several laws including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which are concerned with whether the club issues membership interests that are effectively securities. Club officers and members are not normally required to hold a securities license as long as they refrain from soliciting compensation in exchange for financial advice or soliciting the sale of stock, mutual funds or bonds in third party companies. One allowed exception is that a CEO / President or CFO of a C Corporation is allowed to solicit stock or bonds in their corporation as long as they provide a private placement memorandum that complies with the law to their new shareholders. One additional requirement is that non-accredited investors must be Directors of the C Corporation in addition to being shareholders. = Real Estate Investment Clubs = Clubs of this type are most commonly publicized as a real estate investment group or company, rather than a club. The legal distinction according to the SEC is having 100 members or less. Whereas, a real estate investment group would normally have more than 100 investors. These clubs normally buy real estate or notes (loans originated by a licensed third party) to benefit from: cash flow, appreciation of assets, instant equity, tax benefits from deductions or qualified dividends, group buying power, monthly or daily compounding, higher liquidity and diversification of risk. Real estate transactions are limited to 35 participants to meet the legal requirements of many states for being closely held, and can be legally organized as a sole proprietorship transferring assets to a group living trust, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, general partnership or C corporation. = Business Investment Clubs = These clubs are often called incubators and are formed to purchase businesses that generate cash flow and equity. Investment types range from a group of people buying lower risk franchises with at least two years of significant revenues and positive cash flow like major fast food franchises, gas stations and hotels to higher risk businesses without an income history like start-ups, inventions, or product patenting and prototype development. = Hybrid Investment Clubs = Hybrid clubs are a combination of two or more of the above types of investment clubs. Typically, real estate investment clubs are lower in risk and provide higher returns of 21% to 70% than stock, mutual fund or bond investment clubs due to the ongoing need for housing and population growth. Business investment clubs have about equal risk when compared to stock, mutual fund or bond investment clubs. However, business investment clubs have several additional benefits which include significantly higher returns and lower operating expenses measured by the net profit per year divided by the amount of cash necessary to purchase the business. Additionally, you can also hire yourself or family members to work in the business as employees.  Conduct of business  In order to operate an investment club, business must be conducted in a somewhat orderly fashion. The level of formality will vary based on the club type. A typical club will have informal channels of communication via mailing lists, Twitter accounts or message boards. In addition to the informal channels of communication, an investment club must set up formal channels of communication to conduct business. Typically, this is done with monthly meetings. A typical meeting agenda will include all the normal activity you would expect in an organization with elected officials. A typical meeting agenda: * Roll call * Old business ‚Äì list of any unfinished business from the previous meeting. * Summary of votes ‚Äì Summary of all voted decisions from the previous meeting * NAV presentation ‚Äì NAV or the Net Asset Value of the Club will indicate what each club member is worth on paper. * Available funds ‚Äì a presentation of Available funds to invest. * Presentation of current research ‚Äì each member assigned to present an investment option will present his/her research. * Vote to hold or invest ‚Äì A vote to hold cash, sell current assets or invest in one of the investment options * Investment vote ‚Äì A final vote on an investment strategy specifying an exact amount to invest and strategy to execute that investment. * Other business ‚Äì Typically, other business will include proxy voting needs or other day-to-day business operational needs. This could also include options to change a brokerage house, or discussions of counter party risk. *Formal close of meeting  Legal structure  =UK= Investment clubs are normally unincorporated associations. Members‚Äô contributions are converted into ‚Äòunits‚Äô whose value rises and falls in line with the value of the underlying investments. The clubs are not taxed corporately, and members should account individually for their share of profits and capital gains.HMRC guidance on investment clubs: https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal- manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg20600 =USA= Investment clubs are generally formed as general partnerships, but could also be formed as limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, corporations, or sole proprietorship that transfer real estate assets to a group living trust (similar to a family trust). While an investment club could incorporate, the double tax treatment on corporate distributions makes the corporate structure less desirable than a partnership except in the case when a C Corporation pays out qualified dividends after deducting allowable expenses. Typically, a general partnership does not generate any tax liability on its own; instead, any tax liability is passed through to members each year. However, income taxes are generally much higher than taxes on qualified dividends. In order to understand the legal structure that an investment club should choose, the club should first understand its club type. Each of the different club types will have different legal requirements as well as different reporting requirements. Typically, the SEC only requires reporting for investment groups with over 100 members, which is reclassified as an investment group, not an investment club. Publicly held offerings like a Real Estate Investment Trust as known as a REIT also have additional reporting requirements.  Tax implications  Investment club accounting software can facilitate the management of a club's books and the preparation of tax filings. In the United States Investment club partnerships may have to file Form 1065 and Schedule K-1s with the IRS each year, and with States that require partnership filings. In the United Kingdom investment clubs and their members are required to submit form 185(new) to HMRC each year.

Biography  Babayan was born in Baku, Soviet Union to an Armenian family. He graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 1957. He completed his Ph.D. in 1964 and his doctorate of science in 1971. From 1956 to 1996, Babayan worked in the Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering, where he eventually became Chief of the hardware and software division. Babayan and his team built their first computers during the 1950s. In the 1970s, being one of 15 deputies of chief architect V. S. Burtsev, he worked on the first superscalar computer, the Elbrus-1 and programming language –≠–ª—å-76.–≠–ª—å-76 Using these computers in 1978, ten years before commercial applications appeared in the West, the Soviet Union developed its missile systems and its nuclear and space programs. A team headed by Babayan designed Elbrus-3 computer using an architecture named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC). From 1992 to 2004, Babayan held senior positions in the Moscow Center for SPARC Technology and Elbrus International. In these roles he led the development of Elbrus 2000 (single-chip implementation of Elbrus-3) and Elbrus90micro (SPARC computer based on domestically developed microprocessor) projects. Since August 2004, Babayan is the Director of Architecture for the Software and Solutions Group in Intel Corporation and scientific advisor of the Intel R&D; center in Moscow. He leads efforts in such areas as compilers, binary translation and security technologies. He became the second European holding the Intel Fellow title (after Norwegian, Tryggve Fossum). Babayan was awarded the two highest honors in the former Soviet Union: the USSR State Prize for his achievements in 1974 in the field of computer-aided design, and the Lenin Prize in 1987 for the Elbrus-2 supercomputer design. Since 1984, he has been a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences (later - Russian Academy of Sciences). , he serves as a professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and holds the Microprocessor Technology chair in Moscow based R&D; center of Intel Corporation.

The American Library Association defines informatics as \\"the study of the structure and properties of information, as well as the application of technology to the organization, storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information.\\" Legal informatics therefore, pertains to the application of informatics within the context of the legal environment and as such involves law-related organizations (e.g., law offices, courts, and law schools) and users of information and information technologies within these organizations. Policy issues Policy issues in legal informatics arise from the use of informational technologies in the implementation of law, such as the use of subpoenas for information found in email, search queries, and social networks. Policy approaches to legal informatics issues vary throughout the world. For example, European countries tend to require destruction or anonymization of data so that it cannot be used for discovery. Technology =Cloud computing= The widespread introduction of cloud computing provides several benefits in delivering legal services. Legal service providers can use the Software as a Service model to earn a profit by charging customers a per-use or subscription fee. This model has several benefits over traditional bespoke services. * Software as a service is much more scalable. Traditional bespoke models require an attorney to spend more of a limited resource (their time) on each additional client. Using Software as a Service, a legal service provider can put in effort once to develop the product and then use a much less limited resource (cloud computing power) to provide service to each additional customer. * Software as a service can be used to complement traditional bespoke services by handling routine tasks, leaving an attorney free to concentrate on bespoke work. * Software as a service can be delivered more conveniently because it does not require the legal service provider to be available at the same time as the customer. Software as a service also complicates the attorney-client relationship in a way that may have implications for attorney-client privilege. The traditional delivery model makes it easy to create delineations of when attorney-client privilege attaches and when it does not. But in more complex models of legal service delivery other actors or automated processes may moderate the relationship between a client and their attorney making it difficult to tell which communications should be legally privileged.Chris Johnson, Leveraging Technology to Deliver Legal Services, 23 HARV.

Artificial intelligence and law (AI and law) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) mainly concerned with applications of AI to legal informatics problems and original research on those problems. It is also concerned to contribute in the other direction: to export tools and techniques developed in the context of legal problems to AI in general. For example, theories of legal decision making, especially models of argumentation, have contributed to knowledge representation and reasoning; models of social organization based on norms have contributed to multi-agent systems; reasoning with legal cases has contributed to case-based reasoning; and the need to store and retrieve large amounts of textual data has resulted in contributions to conceptual information retrieval and intelligent databases.

This, in turn, led to the foundation of the Artificial Intelligence and Law Journal, first published in 1992.List of AI and Law journal volumes In Europe, the annual JURIX conferences (organised by the Jurix Foundation for Legal Knowledge Based Systems), began in 1988. Initially intended to bring together the Dutch-speaking (i.e. Dutch and Flemish) researchers, JURIX quickly developed into an international, primarily European, conference and since 2002 has regularly been held outside the Dutch speaking countries.List of Jurix conferences Since 2007 the JURISIN workshops have been held in Japan under the auspices of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.See the list of workshops on the Jurisin 2014 page  Scope  Today, AI and law embrace a wide range of topics, including: * Formal models of legal reasoning * Computational models of argumentation and decision-making * Computational models of evidential reasoning * Legal reasoning in multi-agent systems * Executable models of legislation * Automatic legal text classification and summarization * Automated information extraction from legal databases and texts * Machine learning and data mining for e-discovery and other legal applications * Conceptual or model-based legal information retrieval * Lawbots to automate minor and repetitive legal tasks * Risk assessment, pricing and timeline predictions of litigation using machine learning and artificial intelligence.  Formal models of legal reasoning  Formal models of legal texts and legal reasoning have been used in AI and Law to clarify issues, to give a more precise understanding and to provide a basis for implementations. A variety of formalisms have been used, including propositional and predicate calculi; deontic, temporal and non-monotonic logics; and state transition diagrams. Prakken and SartorH. Prakken and G.Sartor, Law and logic: A review from an argumentation perspective, Artificial Intelligence. Available on-line June 2015. give a detailed and authoritative review of the use of logic and argumentation in AI and Law, together with a comprehensive set of references. An important role of formal models is to remove ambiguity. In fact, legislation abounds with ambiguity: Because it is written in natural language there are no brackets and so the scope of connectives such as \\"and\\" and \\"or\\" can be unclear. \\"Unless\\" is also capable of several interpretations, and legal draftsman never write \\"if and only if\\", although this is often what they intend by \\"if\\". In perhaps the earliest use of logic to model law in AI and Law, Layman Allen advocated the use of propositional logic to resolve such syntactic ambiguities in a series of papers. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s a significant strand of work on AI and Law involved the production of executable models of legislation, originating with Thorne McCarty's TAXMAN and Ronald Stamper's LEGOL . TAXMAN was used to model the majority and minority arguments in a US Tax law case (Eisner v Macomber), and was implemented in the micro-PLANNER programming language. LEGOL was used to provide a formal model of the rules and regulations that govern an organization, and was implemented in a condition-action rule language of the kind used for expert systems. The TAXMAN and LEGOL languages were executable, rule-based languages, which did not have an explicit logical interpretation. However, the formalisation of a large portion of the British Nationality Act by Sergot et al. showed that the natural language of legal documents bears a close resemblance to the Horn clause subset of first order predicate calculus. Moreover, it identified the need to extend the use of Horn clauses by including negative conditions, to represent rules and exceptions. The resulting extended Horn clauses are executable as logic programs. Later work on larger applications, such as that on Supplementary Benefits,T.J.M. Bench-Capon, G.O. Robinson, T.W. Routen, M.J. Sergot, Logic programming for large scale applications in law: a formalisation of supplementary benefit legislation, in: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 1987, pp. 190‚Äì198. showed that logic programs need further extensions, to deal with such complications as multiple cross references, counterfactuals, deeming provisions, amendments, and highly technical concepts (such as contribution conditions). The use of hierarchical representationsT. Routen, T.J.M. Bench-Capon, Hierarchical formalizations, International Journal of Man- Machine Studies 35 (1991) 69‚Äì93. was suggested to address the problem of cross reference; and so-called isomorphicT.J.M. Bench-Capon, F.P. Coenen, Isomorphism and legal knowledge based systems, Artificial Intelligence and Law 1 (1992) 65‚Äì86. representations were suggested to address the problems of verification and frequent amendment. As the 1990s developed this strand of work became partially absorbed into the development of formalisations of domain conceptualisations, (so-called ontologies), which became popular in AI following the work of Gruber.Thomas R. Gruber: The Role of Common Ontology in Achieving Sharable, Reusable Knowledge Bases. Knowledge Representation 1991: 601-602 Early examples in AI and Law include Valente's functional ontologyValente, A. 1995. Legal Knowledge Engineering; A Modelling Approach, IOS Press, Amsterdam. and the frame based ontologies of Visser and van Kralingen.Robert W. van Kralingen, Pepijn R. S. Visser, Trevor J. M. Bench- Capon, H. Jaap van den Herik: A principled approach to developing legal knowledge systems. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies. 51(6): 1127-1154 (1999) Legal ontologies have since become the subject of regular workshops at AI and Law conferences and there are many examples ranging from generic top-level and core ontologiesRinke Hoekstra, Joost Breuker, Marcello Di Bello, Alexander Boer: The LKIF Core Ontology of Basic Legal Concepts. Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Legal Ontologies and Artificial Intelligence Techniques. 2007: 43-63 to very specific models of particular pieces of legislation. Since law comprises sets of norms, it is unsurprising that deontic logics have been tried as the formal basis for models of legislation. These, however, have not been widely adopted as the basis for expert systems, perhaps because expert systems are supposed to enforce the norms, whereas deontic logic becomes of real interest only when we need to consider violations of the norms.A.J. Jones, M.J. Sergot, On the characterisation of law and computer systems: the normative systems perspective, in: J.-J.Ch. Meyer, R.

There is also some interesting work combining deontic and action logics to explore normative positions.M.J. Sergot, A computational theory of normative positions, ACM Trans. Comput. Log. 2 (2001) 581‚Äì622. In the context of multi-agent systems, norms have been modelled using state transition diagrams. Often, especially in the context of electronic institutions,Marc Esteva, Juan A. Rodr√≠guez-Aguilar, Josep Llu√≠s Arcos, Carles Sierra, Pere Garcia: Institutionalizing Open Multi-Agent Systems. ICMAS 2000: 381‚Äì382 the norms so described are regimented (i.e., cannot be violated), but in other systems violations are also handled, giving a more faithful reflection of real norms. For a good example of this approach see Modgil et al.Sanjay Modgil, Nir Oren, Noura Faci, Felipe Meneguzzi, Simon Miles and Michael Luck, Monitoring Compliance with E-Contracts and Norms, Artificial Intelligence and Law 23(2) (2015). Law often concerns issues about time, both relating to the content, such as time periods and deadlines, and those relating to the law itself, such as commencement. Some attempts have been made to model these temporal logics using both computational formalisms such as the Event CalculusR. Hernandez Marin, G. Sartor, Time and norms: a formalisation in the event-calculus, in: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM, New York, 1999, pp. 90‚Äì100. and temporal logics such as defeasible temporal logic.G. Governatori, A. Rotolo, G. Sartor, Temporalised normative positions in defeasible logic, in: Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ACM Press, New York, 2005, pp. 25‚Äì34. In any consideration of the use of logic to model law it needs to be borne in mind that law is inherently non-monotonic, as is shown by the rights of appeal enshrined in all legal systems, and the way in which interpretations of the law change over time.Schauer, Frederick. \\"On the supposed defeasibility of legal rules.\\" Current Legal Problems 51.1 (1998): 223.Prakken, Henry, and Giovanni Sartor. \\"The three faces of defeasibility in the law.\\" Ratio Juris 17.1 (2004): 118-139.R. Loui: Paths to Defeasibility: Reply to Schauer on Hart . APA 12:2, 2013 Moreover, in the drafting of law exceptions abound, and, in the application of law, precedents are overturned as well as followed. In logic programming approaches, negation as failure is often used to handle non-monotonicity,Robert A. Kowalski: The Treatment of Negation in Logic Programs for Representing Legislation. Proceedings of Second International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law. 1989: 11‚Äì15 but specific non-monotonic logics such as defeasible logicBenjamin Johnston, Guido Governatori: Induction of Defeasible Logic Theories in the Legal Domain. Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law 2003:204‚Äì213 have also been used. Following the development of abstract argumentation,Phan Minh Dung: On the Acceptability of Arguments and its Fundamental Role in Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Logic Programming and n-Person Games. Artificial Intelligence 77(2): 321‚Äì358 (1995) however, these concerns are increasingly being addressed through argumentation in monotonic logic rather than through the use of non-monotonic logics. Quantitative legal prediction Both academic and proprietary quantitative legal prediction models exist. One of the earliest examples of a working quantitative legal prediction model occurred in the form of the Supreme Court forecasting project. The Supreme Court forecasting model attempted to predict the results of all the cases on the 2002 term of the Supreme Court. The model predicted 75% of cases correctly compared to experts who only predicted 59.1% of cases.Theodore W. Ruger, Pauline T. Kim, Andrew D. Martin, & Kevin M. Quinn, \\"The Supreme Court Forecasting Project: Legal and Political Science Approaches to Predicting Supreme Court Decisionmaking\\" Columbia Law Review Volume 104 May 2004 Another example of an academic quantitative legal prediction models is a 2012 model that predicted the result of Federal Securities class action lawsuits. Some academics and legal technology startups are attempting to create algorithmic models to predict case outcomes. Part of this overall effort involves improved case assessment for litigation funding. In order to better evaluate the quality of case outcome prediction systems, a proposal has been made to create a standardised dataset that would allow comparisons between systems. Legal practice Within the practice issues conceptual area, progress continues to be made on both litigation and transaction focused technologies. In particular, technology including predictive coding has the potential to effect substantial efficiency gains in law practice. Though predictive coding has largely been applied in the litigation space, it is beginning to make inroads in transaction practice, where it is being used to improve document review in mergers and acquisitions. Other advances, including XML coding in transaction contracts, and increasingly advanced document preparation systems demonstrate the importance of legal informatics in the transactional law space.Darryl Mountain, XML E-Contracts: Documents that Describe Themselves, 11(3) INT'L J.L. & TECH. 274 (2003) Current applications of AI in the legal field utilize machines to review documents, particularly when a high level of completeness and confidence in the quality of document analysis is depended upon, such as in instances of litigation and where due diligence play a role. Donahue L, A Primer on Using Artificial Intelligence in the Legal Profession https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/a-primer-on-using- artificial-intelligence-in-the-legal-profession.. Predictive coding leverages small samples to cross-reference similar items, weed out less relevant documents so attorneys can focus on the truly important key documents, produces statistically validated results, equal to or surpassing the accuracy and, prominently, the rate of human review. Donahue L, A Primer on Using Artificial Intelligence in the Legal Profession https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/a-primer-on-using-artificial-intelligence- in-the-legal-profession.. =Delivery of services= Advances in technology and legal informatics have led to new models for the delivery of legal services. Legal services have traditionally been a \\"bespoke\\" product created by a professional attorney on an individual basis for each client.Richard Susskind, From Bespoke to Commodity, LEGAL TECH. J., 2006, at 4, 4‚Äì7. However, to work more efficiently, parts of these services will move sequentially from (1) bespoke to (2) standardized, (3) systematized, (4) packaged, and (5) commoditized. Moving from one stage to the next will require embracing different technologies and knowledge systems. The spread of the Internet and development of legal technology and informatics are extending legal services to individuals and small-medium companies. =Corporate legal departments= Corporate legal departments may use legal informatics for such purposes as to manage patent portfolios, and for preparation, customization and management of documents.

An ardent abolitionist, he was noted for encouraging thousands of free black men to join the Union army. Birney was a son of prominent Southern abolitionist leader James G. Birney and the older brother of Civil War general David B. Birney. Another brother, James M. Birney, served as Lieutenant Governor of Michigan in 1860. A cousin, Humphrey Marshall, was a U.S. Congressman and a general in the Confederate States Army.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 132. Birth and early years William Birney was born May 28, 1819 on his father's plantation near Huntsville, Alabama. He grew up there and in Danville, Kentucky. Birney was educated at Centre College and Yale University and he practiced law in Cincinnati, Ohio. He then lived for five years in Europe, primarily on the Continent and in England. For two years, he was a professor of English literature at the college in Bourges. He took an active part in the revolutionary movement in France in 1848. He later wrote numerous articles for English and American newspapers. Returning to the United States in 1853, Birney established a newspaper, the Daily Register, in Philadelphia. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Birney entered the Union Army on May 22, 1861 as a captain in the 1st New Jersey Infantry Regiment. He first saw combat in the First Battle of Bull Run. Promoted to major of the 4th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, he participated in the battles of Second Bull Run, Chantilly, Fredericksburg, and, as a colonel, the Chancellorsville. In 1863-64, he was appointed as one of three superintendents in charge of enlisting colored troops into the Union army, and in that capacity organized seven regiments. He was named Colonel of the 22nd U.S. Colored Troops. On June 9, 1863, he was commissioned as a brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from May 22, 1863, and assigned to Maryland to recruit more black troops.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 718.His nomination as brigadier general was not confirmed by the U.S. Senate until April 18, 1864. Eicher, 2001, p. 718. In 1864, he marched his regiments to fight in South Carolina as a part of the Department of the South. They fared poorly, but did much better work in campaigns in Florida, including the Battle of Olustee. Charge of Gen. Birney's troops Birney's brigade was transferred to Virginia and joined other black regiments to form the Third Division of the X Corps under the command of Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler. They suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, but were instrumental in several fights along the defenses of Richmond. In December 1864, the X Corps black regiments were combined with those of the XVIII Corps in the new all-black XXV Corps under Maj. Gen. Godfrey Weitzel. Birney's regiments became the 2nd Division of the XXV Corps, and participated in the last assaults during the Siege of Petersburg in early 1865. He then led his division in the pursuit of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia during the Appomattox Campaign. Birney was mustered out of the volunteer army on August 24, 1865. On July 20, 1866, President of the United States Andrew Johnson nominated Birney for appointment to the grade of brevet major general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865 and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 26, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 710. Birney resided in Florida for several years after the war before moving north in 1874 to establish a law practice in Washington, D.C.. He served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and as a school board trustee until 1886. He wrote profusely on the subjects of religion and history and authored a biography of his father, James G. Birney and His Times; the Genesis of the Republican Party, in 1890. Birney died at his home in Forest Glen, Maryland on August 14, 1907, and was buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown (Washington, D.C.).

It was founded in 1929 through a merger arranged by Weirton Steel with some properties of the Great Lakes Steel Corporation and M.A. Hanna Company with headquarters in Pittsburgh. Despite a difficult market in Depression-setting 1930, the company reported USD 8.4 million in profits. Again, in 1931 the company was profitable unlike many other competitors. The company could attribute its success primarily to sales to the automobile industry. Large steel producing operations were located near Detroit, providing the company with low shipping costs. Throughout the Great Depression, National Steel obtained profitability every year. Post war years The post-World War II years brought about record profits for the company as steel was in high demand. The company continued to post healthy profits in the 1970s, although the latter half of the decade saw some sharp and turbulent profit slumps. The increasing consumption of imported steel was often an attributed problem. It acquired United Financial, a savings and loan, in 1979, adding another sundry item for its portfolio. 1980s Beginning in 1980, the company reported a serious loss of demand and with it profits in its core steel business. A roller coaster earnings surge the next year crashed down the year after that due to a further increase in imports and low demand. In 1983, shareholders agreed to create National Intergroup, a holding company, and merge the steel business as one many units into it. The corporate reorganization was a further step to an already initiated arrangement that started in 1982, which broke the company into six independently managed units. The move was intended to better administer the company which had become diversified away from steel into aluminum and financial services. That same year, the workers of the Weirton mill purchased their operation from National Steel, forming an independent employee-owned corporation. In February 1984, Nippon Kokan K.K., a major Japanese steel producer, acquired 50% of National Steel from National Intergroup for US$ 292 million. Later in 1990, the Japanese firm would claim another 20% share from National Intergroup, which was eager to sell the steel business. The company stumbled through troubled years as it shed thousands of workers and faced bankruptcy in 1991. National Steel spun-off its computer data subsidiary Genix which spun-off the current- day Corporate Election Services, a market leader in proxy statement and proxy fight services based in suburban Pittsburgh. 1990s The company announced in 1991 that it would re-locate its longtime Pittsburgh headquarters to the South Bend, Indiana area. In 1994, the company caused a stir in the industry when it terminated nearly all of its vice presidents, President and CFO, and replaced them by hiring nearly the complete executive staff of the U.S. Steel Gary Works, including V. John Goodwin who was named the new President of National Steel. U.S. Steel was incensed and filed a lawsuit which the two companies settled out-of-court in 1995. However these drastic leadership changes were short-lived, as Goodwin resigned in 1996, the result of a bitter dispute with the Japanese ownership and by 1998 nearly all of the U.S. expatriates had departed from National. 2000s The darkest days of National's management history occurred in 2000, when an internal auditor, tipped off by an informer, discovered that longtime executive James Squires was receiving millions of dollars in kickbacks from scrap suppliers. This was an especially painful event for the company because Squires had been hailed as a \\"self-made man\\" who had advanced from a mill laborer to a Senior Vice President over the course of his 42-year career, and had professed to be the pinnacle of financial stewardship. Nevertheless, in August 2001, Squires was convicted in Federal Court of receiving kickbacks, and in 2002 was sentenced to two years imprisonment. Later he was forced to pay National approximately $3,000,000 in a civil lawsuit. In his allocution at sentencing, Squires noted, apologetically, that he had taken the improper payments because the company was promoting \\"Harvard MBA's\\" more rapidly than it was promoting him. The truth of the matter, however, was that Squires was one of the company's most senior executives, and that National Steel did not have any Harvard MBA's within its ranks, let alone any who were promoted ahead of Squires. The company then lumbered along for the next few years, hampered by doddering executive management. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002, the result of a deep depression in the industry at the time combined with the laggard leadership. Bankruptcy The company would never again enjoy extended periods of profit and finally in March 2002, it filed for bankruptcy with only $2.3 billion in assets for $2.6 billion in debt. After a bidding war between AK Steel and U.S. Steel, in May 2003 the remains of National Steel were sold to U.S. Steel for $850 million and the assumption of $200 million in debt. US Steel continues to operate National's Keewatin mining operation and pellet plant under the new name of Keewatin Taconite or Keetac.

He and his brother, Charles Horace Mayo, both joined their father's private medical practice in Rochester, Minnesota, US, after graduating from medical school in the 1880s. In 1919, that practice became the not-for-profit Mayo Clinic. Augustus Stinchfield was also asked to join the medical practice in 1892 by William Worrall Mayo. Once Stinchfield was hired, W. W. Mayo retired at age 73. Others who were invited to be part of the enterprise were C. Graham, E. Starr Judd, Henry Stanley Plummer, Melvin Millet and Donald Balfour. Early years William James Mayo Will Mayo was born to William Worrall Mayo and his wife Louise in Le Sueur, Minnesota in his parents' home. As a child, William and his brother Charles frequently accompanied their father as he went about his business as a pioneer physician. They began by helping out with very menial tasks, and were gradually given more responsibility. Eventually, the boys were administering anesthesia and tying off blood vessels. One night at the age of 16, Will accompanied his father to an abandoned hotel where one of the elder Mayo's patients worked as the caretaker. The patient had just died and Mayo was going to perform an autopsy. Will stood by and watched the procedure and after about an hour, it was time to go to another patient's home. Mayo asked his son to stay behind and clean up. \\"Sew up the incisions and then tuck the sheet around the corpse. When you finish, go right home.\\" Will nervously began to stitch up the incisions on the body and recounted the incident many years later saying, \\"I'm about as proud of the fact that I walked out of there, instead of ran, as of anything else I ever made myself do\\". Education and career Mayo earned his medical degree at the University of Michigan Medical School in 1883, where he became a founder of Nu Sigma Nu Medical Fraternity. Afterwards he returned to Rochester to practice medicine alongside his father and his brother Charles. On August 21, 1883, a tornado struck Rochester, killing 29 people and seriously injuring over 55 others. One-third of the town was destroyed, but young Will and his family escaped serious harm. The relief efforts began immediately with a temporary hospital being established at the town's dance hall. The Mayo brothers were extensively involved in treating the injured who were brought there for help. Mother Alfred Moes and the Sisters of Saint Francis were called in to act as nurses (despite the fact they were trained as teachers and had little if any medical experience). After the crisis had subsided, Mother Alfred Moes approached William Worrall Mayo about establishing a hospital in Rochester. On September 30, 1889, Saint Mary's Hospital opened. W.W. Mayo, 70 years old, became the consulting physician and surgeon at the hospital, and his two sons began seeing patients and performing surgery with the assistance of the Sisters of Saint Francis. Personal life and death William J. Mayo married Hattie Marie Damon (1864-1952) in 1884. They had 5 children, two of whom survived infancy. Carrie born in 1887 and Pheobe in 1897 both married physicians at the Mayo clinic. He died in July 1939 of gastric carcinoma (stomach cancer) in Rochester, Minnesota. That type of tumor had been a major focus of his surgical practice. Mayo is buried with his family members near his parents and brother at Oakwood Cemetery in Rochester. The United States Postal Service printed a stamp depicting him and his brother, Charles Horace Mayo, on September 11, 1964. Both William J. Mayo and his brother Charles H. Mayo were prominent Freemasons of the Grand Lodge of Minnesota, and members of Rochester Lodge #21. The Dr. William J. Mayo House in Rochester is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Military service William J. Mayo served in World War I at the rank of Colonel (O6), as chief adviser for U.S. Army surgical services in the office of the U.S. Army Surgeon General. His brother Charles was also a Colonel in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and alternated with William as the associate chief adviser for surgical care of U.S. Army soldiers. When President Woodrow Wilson organized the Committee of American Physicians for Medical Preparedness in 1916, William was named its chairman and Charles as one of its members. That committee subsequently became the General Medical Board of the Council for National Defense. William was made a member of its executive committee and Charles was his alternate. During World War I, the Mayo Clinic continued to be busy. Many draftees were examined and war training classes were conducted for new physicians in the medical corps. William and Charles designed courses to educate military doctors on the latest scientific and surgical developments. The two brothers divided their time between Rochester and their duties in Washington, D.C. so that one of them would always be at the Clinic. This schedule took a toll on their health; Charles contracted pneumonia during one of his stints in Washington, and William developed hepatitis while in Rochester in 1918.Mayo Brothers Biography. notablebiographies.com After hostilities ended in November 1918, both of the Mayo brothers were promoted to the rank of Brigadier General (O7) in the U.S. Army Reserve.

Mayo's prediction was that the life expectancy of developed countries would reach 70 years, compared to less than sixty years in 1931. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"90%\\" style=\\"background-color: #EEEEEE;\\" -  > Contagious and infectious diseases have been largely overcome, and the > average length of life of man has increased to fifty-eight years.

Before 1938, Czechoslovakia drove on the left. In 1925, Czechoslovakia accepted the Paris convention and undertook to change to right- hand traffic \\"within a reasonable time frame\\". In 1931, the government decreed to change over within five years, which did not happen. The main obstacles were financial cost and widespread opposition in rural areas. In November 1938, parliament finally decided to change to right-hand traffic with effect from 1 May 1939. Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia The occupation of the Czech part of the country by Nazi Germany and its transformation into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (in German: Protektorat B√∂hmen und M√§hren) on 15 March 1939 sped up the change. A few places switched the same day (e.g. Ostrava), the rest of the area of the Protectorate on 17 March, and Prague got a few more days to implement the change and switched on 26 March. Tramway infrastructure in Prague was modified in November 1938. In the final days there were daily reminders of the change in newspapers and large warnings were painted on the streets and on tramway cars. Drivers adapted quickly and only a small number of traffic accidents happened due to the switch with only one recorded fatality in Prague. Slovakia Right hand traffic was already introduced in Slovakia by a decree of the government of \\"autonomous Slovakia\\" within Czechoslovakia in late 1938. After the creation of the Slovak State in March 1939, Buses in the capital Bratislava were adapted, and the last roads in Slovakia switched to the new system in 1940/1941. The areas which are nowadays the southern border regions of Slovakia were subsequently part of Hungary (under the terms of the First Vienna Award), and did therefore change to right hand traffic as late as 1941, together with the rest of wartime Hungary.

Biography  Agrest was born in Knyazhitsy in the Mogilev Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Republic of Belarus) on 20 July 1915. He graduated from Leningrad State University (now Saint Petersburg State University) in 1938 and received his PhD in Science, Physics and Mathematics in 1946. He became the Chief of the University's Laboratory in 1970. He retired in 1992 and emigrated with his wife Riva to Charleston, South Carolina, in the United States. Agrest authored more than 100 scientific articles and five monographs on the subjects of mathematics, physics and astronomy. Some of his articles were devoted to the question of paleocontacts- contacts of extraterrestrial intelligent beings with Earth. His article \\"–ö–æ—Å–º–æ–Ω–∞–≤—Ç—ã –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏\\" (translated in some places as Astronauts of Yore, and also as Ancient Astronauts; literally, Cosmonauts of Antiquity), published in 1961 in Moscow, has been translated into many languages. Agrest has been said to be the first scientist to advance the theory that Earth had been visited in pre-historic times by intelligent beings from outer space. In a 1959 work, he asserted a number of unorthodox claims, such as that the megalithic stone terracing at Baalbek had been used as a launch site for spaceships, and that the destruction of Biblical Sodom and Gomorrah were the result of a nuclear explosion detonated by extraterrestrial beings. Agrest was a major inspiration of later figures such as Erich von D√§niken and Zecharia Sitchin, who in later decades popularized the idea of ancient astronauts. He has been described as the doyen of the ancient astronaut theory. Agrest was a member of the Ancient Astronaut Society, and contributed a number of articles to the society's periodicals.

It covers 8 hectares and is immediately adjacent to the Belvedere gardens. It is a part of the University of Vienna. The gardens date back to 1754 when Empress Maria Theresa founded the Hortus Botanicus Vindobonensis with renowned botanist Nikolaus von Jacquin as one of its first directors. His son, Joseph von Jacquin, succeeded him as director, as did a number of other leading botanists in turn, including Stefan Endlicher, Eduard Fenzl, Anton Kerner von Marilaun, Richard von Wettstein, Fritz Knoll, Karl von Frisch, and Lothar Geitler. The Institute of Botany building was opened in 1905. However, at the end of the Second World War, the institute, all the greenhouses, and the entire garden area were bombed and severely damaged, and thus required major repair work. The gardens currently contain more than 11,500 species of plants, including well-documented tropical plants, particularly of such families as Annonaceae, Rubiaceae, Gesneriaceae, Bromeliaceae or Orchidaceae.Facts & Maps botanik.univie.ac.at, accessed 12.

He was best known as one of the great chamber music violinists of the twentieth century.  Education  S√°ndor V√©gh was born in 1912 in Kolozsv√°r, Transylvania, Austria-Hungary, (since 1920 Cluj-Napoca, Romania). His parents were not professional musicians but folk music especially was an important part of family life. At the age of six he was given a violin, ‚ÄúBecause‚Äù, he says, ‚Äúthat was cheaper than a piano. My parents had no idea how much money I had to save later to be able to buy a Stradivari.‚Äù He entered the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music in 1924, taking violin studies with Jen≈ë Hubay and composition with Zolt√°n Kod√°ly. He began a career as a solo violinist and in 1927, when he played a Richard Strauss composition under the composer‚Äôs baton. He graduated from the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music in 1930, having won the Hubay Prize and the Rem√©nyi Prize from the institution in 1927.  Chamber musician  As his solo career was developing, he joined the Hungarian Trio with Ilonka Krauss and L√°szl√≥ Vencze. In 1934, he became one of the founding members of the Hungarian String Quartet. He was initially the first violinist, but gave that position to Zolt√°n Sz√©kely and took second chair. He participated with the Hungarian String Quartet in the first Hungarian performance of B√©la Bart√≥k's String Quartet No. 5. V√©gh left the Hungarian String Quartet in 1940 to found his own quartet, the V√©gh Quartet. At the first international music competition held in Genova in 1946, the V√©gh Quartet was awarded the first prize. He and the quartet left Hungary in 1946. The quartet continued to give concerts until the mid-1970s; V√©gh also made solo appearances as a violinist. From 1958 V√©gh played on his own Stradivari from 1724, which once belonged to Niccol√≤ Paganini.  Teaching, conducting In the same year (1940) in which he established the quartet that bore his name, V√©gh became a professor at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, a position he held until 1946, when he left Hungary. In 1952 he met cellist Pablo Casals, who invited V√©gh to join him in giving summer classes in Zermatt, Switzerland (1953‚Äì62), and to appear annually at Casals' Prades Festival (1953‚Äì69). He began his first recital there with Bach: the solo Sonata in g minor. Works of Bach played a special role in his life, as V√©gh himself declared on numerous occasions. He found teaching rewarding, and taught at the Basel Conservatory (1953‚Äì63), in Freiburg (1954‚Äì62), D√ºsseldorf (1962‚Äì69), and at the Mozarteum in Salzburg (1971‚Äì97). He founded the International Chamber Music Festival of Cervo (Liguria, Italy) in 1962, and often conducted there. He also founded an orchestra, the S√°ndor V√©gh Chamber Orchestra, which he led from 1968 to 1971, and conducted the Marlboro Festival Orchestra (1974‚Äì77). And in 1972, after visiting Cornwall (England) at Hilary Tunstall-Behrens' invitation, he co- founded the International Musicians Seminar Prussia Cove (England). In 1978 he became conductor of the Camerata Academica at the Mozarteum. With them he made a recording of Mozart‚Äôs divertimentos and serenades that won the Grand Prix du Disque in 1989. He was awarded \\"Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur\\" in 1986, Doctor Honoris causa of Warwick and Exeter universities (1987), an honorary appointment as Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1988, and the Gold Medal of Salzburg in 1987. Carlos Kleiber referred to V√©gh as \\"my conducting idol\\", and said \\"That man is pure music. A monster\\" in letters to Charles Barber. \\"He is great, wild, Asiatic... I didn't get a word in edgeways, thank God.\\" V√©gh took French citizenship in 1953, but is perhaps best regarded as a \\"world citizen of music\\", having made his home in Basel and, from 1971, in Greifensee, near Zurich. He also lived in Salzburg from the 1970s onwards. After a short illness in 1997, he died at a hospital in Freilassing, just across the border from Salzburg. His grave is in the cemetery of the old parish church in Liefering, in the district of Salzburg.knerger.de: Grave of S√°ndor V√©gh in Salzburg.

Its common name is Colorado blue columbine; sometimes it is called \\"Rocky Mountain columbine,\\" but this also refers to Aquilegia saximontana. The Latin specific name coerulea (or caerulea) means \\"sky blue\\".  Description  It is a herbaceous perennial plant often found at elevations of 2,100 to 3,700 m (6,900 to 12,100 ft). This beautiful plant can grow to 20‚Äì60 cm (8‚Äì24 in) tall, with flowers sprouting in inflorescences produced from the shoot apical meristem. The flowers are very variable in color, from pale blue (as in the species name coerulea) to white, pale yellow and pinkish; very commonly the flowers are bicolored, with the sepals a different shade to the petals. They consist of five petals, five sepals and an ovary surrounded by 50 to 130 stamens. Five long spurs hang below the calyx and contain nectar at their tips, accessible only to hawkmoths. In addition to hawkmoths, pollinators for this flower include bumble-bees, solitary bees and syphrid flies. Aquilegia coerulea is the state flower of Colorado.

El-Ghad is a centrist liberal secular political party pressing for widening the scope of political participation and for a peaceful rotation of power. The official El-Ghad Party, headed by Moussa Moustafa Moussa, was running the 2011‚Äì12 Egyptian parliamentary election as an independent list. The split faction Ghad El- Thawra Party, headed by Ayman Nour, was part of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party-led Democratic Alliance for Egypt. Background Ayman Nour left the New Wafd Party in 2001, and established El-Ghad. The party was legalized in 2004. After facing president Hosni Mubarak in the 2005 Egyptian presidential election, Nour was sentenced to five years in jail on forgery charges. In 2005, just before Nour being sentenced, the El-Ghad party split in two factions. One was headed by Moussa Moustafa Moussa, the other by Nour's (now former) wife Gameela Ismail. Legal battle ensued between both factions, both claiming legitimacy and simultaneously using the party name and insignia. The final court ruling in May 2011 was in favor of Moussa.ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖŸàÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜÿå \\"ÿ¥ÿ¶ŸàŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ≠ÿ≤ÿßÿ®\\" ÿ™ÿ±ŸÅÿ∂ ŸÇÿ®ŸàŸÑ ÿ™ÿ£ÿ≥Ÿäÿ≥ ÿ≠ÿ≤ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØ . ÿßŸÑŸäŸàŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿßÿ®ÿπ 2011-9-5. ŸàÿµŸÑ ŸÑŸáÿ∞ÿß ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ÿßÿ± ŸÅŸä 28 ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ™ŸÖÿ®ÿ± 2011. Ayman Nour hence filed for a new party, Ghad El-Thawra Party or \\"Revolution's Tomorrow Party\\", which was approved on 9 October 2011. The removal of Nour from the party leadership by Moussa, and the latter's election to the Egyptian Upper House, have been seen as compliances with the Hosni Mubarak regime.  Platform  The party platform calls for: * Political and economic reform. * Paying a special care for the handicapped. * Combating drug addiction. * Solving the water crisis. Name confusion Ayman Nour has been tightly associated with both the El-Ghad name and party, even being accused of internal monopoly by other party members. Since both Nour and Moussa factions were using (and still are) the same name and insignia (ex: Ghad El-Thawra website), it was often difficult to tell them apart. For instance, Liberal International listed El-Ghad, specifying its leader as Ayman Nour, as an observer member.Datasheet on the Liberal International's website Many poll and media outlets used the term \\"El-Ghad\\" without specifying which party or faction they are referring to, although they often meant the Ayman Nour Ghad El-Thawra faction.

Go for Broke! is a 1951 black-and-white war film directed by Robert Pirosh, \\"Robert Pirosh, 79, Veteran of Combat and Author, Is Dead,\\" New York Times. December 31, 1989. produced by Dore Schary and starring Van Johnson and six veterans of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. The film co- stars Henry Nakamura, Warner Anderson, and Don Haggerty in its large cast. The film dramatizes the real-life story of the 442nd, which was composed of Nisei (second-generation Americans born of Japanese parents) soldiers.Barsam, Richard. (1992). Nonfiction Film: a Critical History, p. 220. Fighting in the European theater during World War II, this unit became the most heavily decorated unit for its size and length of service in the history of the United States Army, as well as one of the units with the highest casualty rates.Sterner, C. Douglas. (2005). Go For Broke: The Nisei Warriors of World War II Who Conquered Germany, p. 141. This film is a Hollywood rarity for its era in that it features Asian Americans in a positive light, highlighting the wartime efforts of Japanese Americans on behalf of their country even while that same country confined their families in camps. As with his earlier film script for Battleground, in which Van Johnson also starred, writer-director Robert Pirosh focuses on the average squad member, mixing humor with pathos, while accurately detailing equipment and tactics used by American infantry in World War II.Crowther, Bosley. \\"'Go for Broke!', Tribute to War Record of Nisei Regiment, Opens at the Capitol\\", New York Times. May 25, 1951. The contrast of reality versus public relations, the hardships of field life on the line, and the reality of high casualty rates are accurately portrayed with a minimum of heroics. In 1979, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Plot In 1943 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, the newly commissioned Lt. Michael Grayson (Johnson) reports for duty to train the 442nd, a unit established on the US mainland and composed of Nisei. His expectation was to return to the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, a Texas National Guard unit, which he had served as an enlisted soldier. He has to come to terms with a group of people that he sees as Japanese, the enemy, rather than Americans. Grayson runs his platoon rather insisting on strict observance of military regulations. He learns that \\"Go for broke\\" is a pidgin phrase used in Hawaii meaning to gamble everything, to \\"shoot the works\\"‚Äîto risk \\"going broke\\" or bankruptcy. Grayson comes to learn the meaning of the frequently exclaimed Baka tare, which, loosely translates to mean \\"very stupid.\\" There is only one brief discussion of the internment camps from which most of the men have come, but throughout the film there are references to the camps. There are also a few brief references to the distinctions between the Nisei from Hawaii (\\"Buta-heads\\") and those from the mainland (\\"Kotonks\\"). While Buta-heads (the phrase later devolved to \\"Buddha-Heads\\") are a key part of the Hawaiian economy and Hawaiian society, Katonks were largely distrusted and disliked by their neighbors. Arriving in Italy, the unit is joined by the 100th Battalion, a Nisei unit formed in Hawaii before the 442nd. The troops of the 100th are seasoned veterans and the new arrivals look to them for advice. On the march to the front lines, Grayson gets left behind when fraternizing with a signorina, but he is not found by the colonel because his platoon has covered for him during an inspection of their positions. By the actions by the 442nd in Italy and France, Grayson finds reason to replace his bigotry with respect toward them. His transfer to the 36th, as a liaison‚Äîover his objections‚Äîcomes through when the 442nd is attached to the 36th. As he has misjudged the Nisei, they have misjudged him. The Nisei learn that he has defended them against bigotry, even getting into a fistfight with an old friend from the 36th had insulted them. The 36th is surrounded by the German army and the \\"Buddha-heads'\\" rescue \\"them\\". On their return home, they are the awarded the distinction of the eighth Presidential Unit Citation.Takemoto, Kenneth.' (2006). Nisei memories: my parents talk about the war years, p. 120.

N. and Sir James Wellwood Moncreiff, 9th Baronet, a Scottish judge.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 100th Edn, London, 1953. He was born at his parents' Edinburgh townhouse on 13 Northumberland Street.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1810 He was educated at Edinburgh High School then studied Law at the University of Edinburgh and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1833. He was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland in 1850, and Lord Advocate from 1851 to 1852, from 1852 to 1858, from 1859 to 1866 and from 1868 to 1869. He was Dean of the Faculty of Advocates from 1858 to 1869. He was appointed Lord Justice Clerk from 1869 to 1888. Moncreiff was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1869. He was Rector of the University of Glasgow from 1868 to 1871, and held the degrees of LLD from both Edinburgh and Glasgow universities. Moncreiff was Member of Parliament for Leith Burghs from 1851 to 1859, for Edinburgh from 1859 to 1868 and for Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities in 1868. During a long career in parliament Moncreiff guided the passing of over 100 acts of parliament, and his name is associated with the reform of legal procedure and mercantile law. As lord advocate he was engaged as public prosecutor in important cases, notably the trials of Madeline Smith, Wielobycki, and the directors of the Western bank. In 1856, he defended the Scotsman in the libel action raised by Duncan McLaren, one of the members for the city of Edinburgh. In January 1857, Moncreiff was presented with the freedom of his native city for the part he took in regard to the Municipal Extension Act. In 1859 he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the newly-formed 1st Queen's Edinburgh Rifle Volunteer Brigade (No 1 Company of which was recruited from Edinburgh advocates) ‚Äì the first rifle volunteer corps in Scotland. He held the appointment until 1873 when he was appointed Honorary Colonel.Army ListMaj-Gen J.M. Grierson, Records of the Scottish Volunteer Force 1859‚Äì1908, Edinburgh:Blackwood, 1909, pp. 177‚Äì84. In 1860, he helped pass the annuity tax bill, a subject in which, as a free churchman, he took close interest, and in the following year he carried the major bill relating to burgh and parochial schools. In 1861 he was engaged as leading counsel in the defence of Sir William Johnston, one of the directors of the Edinburgh and Glasgow bank, and in 1863-4 he was counsel in the famous Yelverton case. For 19 years Lord Moncreiff occupied the judicial bench, presiding over the trials in the justiciary court of Chantrelle (1878), the City of Glasgow Bank directors (1878), the dynamitards (1883), and the crofters (1886). Extrajudicially Moncreiff was occupied in many other matters. As a lecturer he was in great request, and delivered numerous orations in Edinburgh and Glasgow on subjects of literary, scientific, and political interest to the Philosophical Institution, Royal Society, Juridical Society, Scots Law Society, and other bodies. Moncreiff also published anonymously in 1871 a novel entitled A Visit to my Discontented Cousin, which was reprinted, with additions, from Fraser's Magazine. He was also a frequent contributor to the Edinburgh Review. In 1858 Moncreiff received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh. From 1868 to 1871 he was rector of the University of Glasgow from which he received a second honorary doctorate of LL.D. in 1879, and in 1869 he was appointed a member of the Privy Council. On 23 May 1871 he was created a baronet of Kilduff in the County of Kinross in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. On 9 January 1874 he was created Baron Moncreiff, of Tulliebole in the County of Kinross in the Peerage of the United Kingdom; in 1878 he was appointed a royal commissioner under the Endowed Institutions (Scotland) Act, and in 1883 he succeeded his brother as 11th baronet of Moncreiff. In 1870 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer was Charles Neaves. He was President of the Society 1879 to 1884. In September 1888, Moncreiff resigned the position of Lord Justice Clerk, and took up the preparation of his Memorials. On these he was engaged till his death on 27 April 1895. Family On 12 September 1834 Moncreiff married Isabella Bell (d.1881), only daughter of Robert Bell FRSE (1781-1861), procurator of the Church of Scotland, and Sheriff of Berwickshire and Haddingtonshire. They lived at 47 Moray Place in the west end of Edinburgh. They had two daughters and five sons.

It also for many years generously funded Carnegie's other philanthropic organizations, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP), the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT), and the Carnegie Institution for Science (CIS). History =Founding and early years= By 1911 Andrew Carnegie had endowed five organizations in the US and three in the United Kingdom, and given more than $43 million to build public libraries and given another almost $110 million elsewhere. But ten years after he sold the Carnegie Steel Company, more than $150 million remained in his accounts and at 76, he wearied of philanthropic choices. Long-time friend Elihu Root suggested he establish a trust. Carnegie transferred most of his remaining fortune into it, and made the trust responsible for distributing his wealth after he died. Carnegie's previous charitable giving had used conventional organizational structures, but he chose a corporation as the structure for his last and largest trust. Chartered by the State of New York as the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the corporation's capital fund, originally worth about $135 million, had a market value of $1.55 billion on March 31, 1999. In 1911-1912, Carnegie gave the corporation $125 million. At that time the corporation was the largest single philanthropic charitable trust ever established. He also made it a residual legatee under his will so it therefore received an additional $10 million, the remainder of his estate after had paid his other bequests. Carnegie reserved a portion of the corporation's assets for philanthropy in Canada and the then-British Colonies, an allocation first referred to as the Special Fund, then the British Dominions and Colonies Fund, and later the Commonwealth Program. Charter amendments have allowed the corporation to use 7.4 percent of its income in countries that are or once were members of the British Commonwealth. In its early years Carnegie served as both president and trustee. His private secretary James Bertram and his financial agent, Robert A. Franks, acted as trustees as well and, respectively, corporation secretary and treasurer. This first executive committee made most of the funding decisions. Other seats on the board were held ex officio by presidents of five previously-established US Carnegie organizations: *Carnegie Institute (of Pittsburgh) (1896), *Carnegie Institution of Washington (1902), *Carnegie Hero Fund Commission (1904), *Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT) (1905), *Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP) (1910). After Carnegie died in 1919, the trustees elected a full-time salaried president as the trust's chief executive officer and ex officio trustee. For a time the corporation's gifts followed the patterns Carnegie had already established. Grants for public libraries and church organs continued until 1917, and also went to other Carnegie organizations, and universities, colleges, schools, and educational agencies. Carnegie's letter of gift to the original trustees making the endowment said that the trustees would \\"best conform to my wishes by using their own judgement.\\" Corporation strategies changed over the years but remained focused on education, although the trust did also increasingly fund scientific research, convinced that the nation needed more scientific expertise and \\"scientific management\\". It also worked to build research facilities for the natural and social sciences. The corporation made large grants to the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, the National Bureau of Economic Research, Stanford University's now-defunct Food Research Institute and the Brookings Institution, then became interested in adult education and lifelong learning, an obvious follow-on to Carnegie's vision for libraries as \\"the university of the people\\". In 1919 it initiated the Americanization Study to explore educational opportunities for adults, primarily for new immigrants. =Frederick P. Keppel= With Frederick P. Keppel as president (1923-1941), the Carnegie Corporation shifted from creating public libraries to strengthening library infrastructure and services, developing adult education, and adding arts education to the programs of colleges and universities. The foundation's grants in this period have a certain eclectic quality and remarkable perseverance in its chosen causes.Richard Glotzer, \\"A long shadow: Frederick P. Keppel, the Carnegie Corporation and the Dominions and Colonies Fund Area Experts 1923‚Äì1943.\\" History of Education 38.5 (2009): 621-648. Keppel initiated a famous 1944 study of race relations in the United States by the Swedish social economist Gunnar Myrdal in 1937 by naming a non-American outsider as manager of the study. His theory that this task should be done by someone unencumbered by traditional attitudes or earlier conclusions led to Myrdal's widely heralded book American Dilemma (1944). The book had no immediate effect on public policy, but was later much cited in legal challenges to segregation. Keppel believed foundations should make facts available and let them facts speak for themselves. His cogent writings on philanthropy made a lasting impression on field and influenced the organization and leadership of many new foundations.Walter Jackson, \\"The Making of a Social Science Classic: Gunnar Myrdal's An American Dilemma.\\" Perspectives in American History 2 (1985): 221-67. In 1927 Keppel toured sub- Saharan Africa and recommended a first set of grants to establish public schools in eastern and southern Africa. Other grants went to for municipal library development in South Africa. During 1928 the corporation initiated the Carnegie Commission on the Poor White Problem in South Africa. Better known as the \\"Carnegie Poor White Study\\", it promoted strategies to improve the lives of rural Afrikaner whites and other poor whites in general. A memorandum sent to Keppel said there was \\"little doubt that if the natives were given full economic opportunity, the more competent among them would soon outstrip the less competent whites\\"The Silent War: Imperialism and the Changing Perception of Race By Frank F√ºredi. Page 66-67. Keppel endorsed the project that produced the report, motivated by his concern with maintaining existing racial boundaries. The corporation's concern for the so-called \\"poor white problem\\" in South Africa stemmed at least in part from similar misgivings about poor whites in the American South. White poverty defied traditional understandings of white racial superiority and thus became the subject of study. The report recommended that \\"employment sanctuaries\\" be established for poor white workers and that poor white workers replace \\"native\\" workers in most skilled aspects of the economy.Haunted by Empire: Geographies of Intimacy in North American History By Ann Laura Stoler. Page 66. The authors of the report suggested that white racial deterioration and miscegenation would be the outcome unless something was done to help poor whites, endorsing the necessity of the role of social institutions to play in the successful maintenance of white racial superiority.Racially segregated school libraries in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa by Jennifer Verbeek. Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, Vol. 18, No. 1, 23-46 (1986) The report expressed trepidation concerning the loss of white racial pride, with the implicit consequence that poor whites would not successfully resist \\"Africanisation.\\" The report sought, in part, to forestall the historically inevitable accession of a communal, class based, democratic socialist movement aimed at uniting the poor of each race in common cause and brotherhood.The American Century: Consensus and Coercion in the Projection of American Power By David Slater and Peter James Taylor. Page 290. , 1999 =Charles Dollard= World War II and its immediate aftermath were a relatively inactive period for the Carnegie Corporation. Charles Dollard had joined the staff in 1939 as Keppel's assistant and became president in 1948. The foundation took greater interest in the social sciences, and particularly the study of human behavior. The trust also entered into international affairs. Dollard urged it to fund quantitative, \\"objective\\" social science research like research in physical sciences, and help to diffuse the results through major universities. The corporation advocated for standardized testing in schools to determine academic merit regardless of the student's socio-economic background. Its initiatives have also included helping to broker the creation of the Educational Testing Service in 1947. The corporation determined that the US increasingly needed policy and scholarly expertise in international affairs, and so tied into area studies programs at colleges and universities as well as the Ford Foundation. In 1948 the trust also provided the seed money to establish the Russian Research Center at Harvard University, today known as the Davis Center for Russia and Eurasian Studies, as an organization that could address large-scale research from both a policy and educational points of view. In 1951 the Group Areas Act took effect in South Africa and effectively put the apartheid system into place, leading to political ascendancy for Afrikaners and dispossession for many Africans and colored people suddenly required to live in certain areas of the country only, on pain of imprisonment for remaining in possession of homes in areas designated for whites. The Carnegie corporation pulled its philanthropic endeavors from South Africa for more than two decades after this political change, turning its attention from South Africa to developing East African and West African universities instead. =John Gardner= John W. Gardner was promoted from a staff position to the presidency in 1955. Gardner simultaneously became president of the CFAT, which was housed at the corporation. During Gardner's time in office the Carnegie Corporation worked to upgrade academic competence in foreign area studies and strengthened its liberal arts education program. In the early 1960s it inaugurated a continuing education program and funded development of new models for advanced and professional study by mature women. Important funding went to the key early experiments in continuing education for women, with major grants to the University of Minnesota (1960, co- directors Elizabeth L. Cless and Virginia L. Senders), Radcliffe College (1961, under President Mary Bunting), and Sarah Lawrence College (1962, under Professor Esther Raushenbush).Elizabeth L. Cless, \\"The Birth of an Idea: An Account of the Genesis of Women's Continuing Education,\\" in Helen S. Astin (ed.), Some Action of Her Own: The Adult Woman and Higher Education, Lexington, MA: Lexington Books, 1976, pp.6-7. Gardner's interest in leadership development led to the White House Fellows program in 1964. Notable grant projects in higher education in sub-Saharan Africa include the 1959-60 Ashby Commission study of Nigerian needs in postsecondary education. This study stimulated aid increases from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States to African nations' systems of higher and professional education. Gardner had a strong interest in education, but as a psychologist he believed in the behavioral sciences and urged the corporation to funded much of the US' basic research on cognition, creativity, and the learning process, particularly among young children, associating psychology and education. Perhaps its most important contribution to reform of pre-college education at this time was the series of education studies done by James B. Conant, former president of Harvard University; in particular, Conant's study of comprehensive American high schools (1959) resolved public controversy concerning the purpose of public secondary education, and made the case that schools could adequately educate both average students and the academically gifted. Under Gardner, the corporation embraced strategic philanthropy‚Äîplanned, organized, and deliberately constructed to attain stated ends. Funding criteria no longer required just a socially desirable project. The corporation sought out projects that would produce knowledge leading to useful results, communicated to decision-makers, the public, and the media, in order to foster policy debate. Developing programs that larger organizations, especially governments, could implement and scale in size became a major objective. The policy shift to institutional knowledge transfer came in part as a response to relatively diminished resources that made it necessary to leverage assets and \\"multiplier effects\\" to have any effect at all. The corporation considered itself a trendsetter in philanthropy, often funding research or providing seed money for ideas while others financed more costly operations. For example, ideas it advanced resulted in the National Assessment of Educational Progress, later adopted by the federal government. A foundation's most precious asset was its sense of direction, Gardner said, gathering a competent professional staff of generalists that he called his \\"cabinet of strategy,\\" and regarded as a resource as important to the corporation as its endowment. =Alan Pifer= While Gardner's opinion of educational equality was to multiply the channels through which an individual could pursue opportunity, it was during the term of long-time staff member Alan Pifer, who became acting president during 1965 and president during 1967 (again of both Carnegie Corporation and the CFAT), that the foundation began to respond to claims by various groups, including women, for increased power and wealth. The corporation developed three interlocking objectives: prevention of educational disadvantage; equality of educational opportunity in the schools; and broadened opportunities in higher education. A fourth objective cutting across these programs was to improve the democratic performance of government. Grants were made to reform state government as the laboratories of democracy, underwrite voter education drives, and mobilize youth to vote, among other measures. Use of the legal system became a method for achieving equal opportunity in education, as well as redress of grievance, and the corporation joined the Ford and Rockefeller foundations and others in funding educational litigation by civil rights organizations. It also initiated a multifaceted program to train black lawyers in the South for the practice of public interest law and to increase the legal representation of black people. Maintaining its commitment to early childhood education, the corporation endorsed the application of research knowledge in experimental and demonstration programs, which subsequently provided strong evidence of the long-term positive effects of high-quality early education, particularly for the disadvantaged. A 1980 report on an influential study, the Perry Preschool Project of the HighScope Educational Research Foundation, on the outcomes for sixteen-year-olds enrolled in the experimental preschool programs provided crucial evidence that safeguarded Project Head Start in a time of deep cuts to federal social programs. The foundation also promoted educational children's television and initiated the Children's Television Workshop, producer of Sesame Street and other noted children's programs. Growing belief in the power of educational television prompted creation of the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television, whose recommendations were adopted into the Public Broadcasting Act of 1968 that established a public broadcasting system. Many other reports on US education the corporation financed at this time, included Charles E. Silberman's acclaimed Crisis in the Classroom (1971), and the controversial Inequality: A Reassessment of the Effect of Family and Schooling in America by Christopher Jencks (1973). This report confirmed quantitative research, e.g. the Coleman Report, showed that in public schools resources only weakly correlated with educational outcomes, which coincided with the foundation's burgeoning interest in improved school effectiveness. Becoming involved with South Africa again during the mid-1970s, the corporation worked through universities to increase the legal representation of black people and increase the practice of public interest law. At the University of Cape Town, it established the Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and Development in Southern Africa, this time to examine the legacies of apartheid and make recommendations to nongovernmental organizations for actions commensurate with the long-run goal of achieving a democratic, interracial society. The influx of nontraditional students and \\"baby boomers\\" into higher education prompted formation of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education (1967), funded by the CFAT. (During 1972, the CFAT became an independent institution after experiencing three decades of restricted control over its own affairs.) In its more than ninety reports, the commission made detailed suggestions for introducing more flexibility into the structure and financing of higher education. One outgrowth of the commission's work was creation of the federal Pell grants program offering tuition assistance for needy college students. The corporation promoted the Doctor of Arts \\"teaching\\" degree as well as various off-campus undergraduate degree programs, including the Regents Degree of the State of New York and Empire State College. The foundation's combined interest in testing and higher education resulted in establishment of a national system of college credit by examination (College-Level Entrance Examination Program of the College Entrance Examination Board). Building on its past programs to promote the continuing education of women, the foundation made a series of grants for the advancement of women in academic life. Two other study groups formed to examine critical problems in American life were the Carnegie Council on Children (1972) and the Carnegie Commission on the Future of Public Broadcasting (1977), the latter formed almost ten years after the first commission. =David A.

Hamburg, a physician, educator, and scientist with a public health background, became president in 1982 intending to mobilize the best scientific and scholarly talent and thinking on \\"prevention of rotten outcomes\\" - from early childhood to international relations. The corporation pivoted from higher education to the education and healthy development of children and adolescents, and the preparation of youth for a scientific and technological, knowledge-driven world. In 1984 the corporation established the Carnegie Commission on Education and the Economy. Its major publication, A Nation Prepared (1986), reaffirmed the role of the teacher as the \\"best hope\\" for quality in elementary and secondary education. That report led to the establishment a year later of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, to consider ways to attract able candidates to teaching and recognize and retain them. At the corporation's initiative, the American Association for the Advancement of Science issued two reports, Science for All Americans (1989) and Benchmarks for Science Literacy (1993), which recommended a common core of learning in science, mathematics, and technology for all citizens and helped set national standards of achievement. A new emphasis for the corporation was the danger to world peace posed by the superpower confrontation and weapons of mass destruction. The foundation underwrote scientific study of the feasibility of the proposed federal Strategic Defense Initiative and joined the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to support the analytic work of a new generation of arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts. After the end of the USSR, corporation grants helped promote the concept of cooperative security among erstwhile adversaries and projects to build democratic institutions in the former Soviet Union and Central Europe. The Prevention of Proliferation Task Force, coordinated by a grant to the Brookings Institution, inspired the Nunn-Lugar Amendment to the Soviet Threat Reduction Act of 1991, intended to help dismantle Soviet nuclear weapons and reduce proliferation risks. More recently, the corporation addressed interethnic and regional conflict and funded projects seeking to diminish the risks of a wider war resulting from civil strife. Two Carnegie commissions, Reducing the Nuclear Danger (1990), the other Preventing Deadly Conflict (1994), addressed the dangers of human conflict and the use of weapons of mass destruction. The corporation's emphasis in Commonwealth Africa, meanwhile, shifted to women's health and political development and the application of science and technology, including new information systems, to foster research and expertise in indigenous scientific institutions and universities. During Hamburg's tenure, dissemination achieved even greater primacy with respect to strategic philanthropy. Consolidation and diffusion of the best available knowledge from social science and education research was used to improve social policy and practice, as partner with major institutions with the capability to influence public thought and action. If \\"change agent\\" was a major term during Pifer's time, \\"linkage\\" became a byword in Hamburg's. The corporation increasingly used its convening powers to bring together experts across disciplinary and sectoral boundaries to create policy consensus and promote collaboration. Continuing tradition, the foundation established several other major study groups, often directed by the president and managed by a special staff. Three groups covered the educational and developmental needs of children and youth from birth to age fifteen: the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development (1986), the Carnegie Task Force on Meeting the Needs of Young Children (1991), and the Carnegie Task Force on Learning in the Primary Grades (1994). Another, the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology, and Government (1988), recommended ways that government at all levels could make more effective use of science and technology in their operations and policies. Jointly with the Rockefeller Foundation, the corporation financed the National Commission on Teaching & America's Future, whose report, What Matters Most (1996), provided a framework and agenda for teacher education reform across the country. These study groups drew on knowledge generated by grant programs and inspired follow-up grantmaking to implement their recommendations. =Vartan Gregorian= During the presidency of Vartan Gregorian the corporation reviewed its management structure and grants programs. In 1998 the corporation established four primary program headings: education, international peace and security, international development, and democracy. In these four main areas, the corporation continued to engage with major issues confronting higher education. Domestically, it emphasized reform of teacher education and examined the current status and future of liberal arts education in the United States. Abroad, the corporation sought to devise methods to strengthen higher education and public libraries in Commonwealth Africa. As a cross-program initiative, and in cooperation with other foundations and organizations, the corporation instituted a scholars program, offering funding to individual scholars, particularly in the social sciences and humanities, in the independent states of the former Soviet Union.

Biography Mortillet was educated at the Jesuit college of Chamb√©ry and at the Paris Conservatoire. Becoming in 1847 proprietor of La Revue ind√©pendante, he was implicated in the Revolution of 1848 and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. He fled the country and during the next fifteen years lived abroad, chiefly in Italy. In 1858 he turned his attention to ethnological research, making a special study of the Swiss lake-dwellings. He also issued three works on the evidence for early man in North Italy, the third making a then unprecedented association with the Ice Age.G. Bibby, The Testimony of the Spade (Fontana 1962) p. 66 He returned to Paris in 1864, and soon afterwards was appointed curator of the museum at St Germain. He became mayor of the town, and in 1885 he was elected deputy for Seine-et-Oise. He had meantime founded a review, Mat√©riaux pour l'histoire positive et philosophique de l'homme, and in conjunction with Broca assisted to found the French School of Anthropology. He died at St Germain-en-Laye on 25 September 1898. Typological stages Mortillet is best known for his clarification and ordering of the archeology of the Paleolithic.W. Bray ed., The Penguin Dictionary of Archeology (Penguin 1972) p. 152 Where √âdouard Lartet had used fauna as a distinguishing feature ‚Äì Mammoth against Reindeer ‚Äì for his important discoveries, Mortillet realised that as fauna varied with latitude they were unreliable indicators, and proposed instead a classification by means of dwelling places: Alluvial or Cave epochs, for example.G. Bibby, The Testimony of the Spade (Fontana 1962) p. 68 Later acknowledging the ambiguity in that system as well, he published a new classification in 1869, using type sites and their associated artifacts to distinguish and name periods: (Chellian, Mousterian, Solutrean, Magdalenian, Robenhausen).G. Bibby, The Testimony of the Spade (Fontana 1962) p. 69 His system may have subsequently been refined, but still remains in current use. However, whereas Mortillet believed his classifications were universal stages, with a unilineal evolution, later thinking regards each culture as a more localised conglomerate, capable of overlapping in time with others, not necessarily lineally related.W. Bray ed., The Penguin Dictionary of Archeology (Penguin 1972) p. 153 Mortillet proposed the name \\"Marnian Epoch\\" as a replacement for the period usually called the Gallic, which extends from about five centuries before the Christian era to the conquest of Gaul by Caesar. Mortillet generally objected to the term Gallic, as the civilization characteristic of the epoch was not peculiar to the ancient Gauls, but was common to nearly all Europe at the same date. The name is derived from the French d√©partement of Marne. Stone age art De Mortillet recognised the importance of the mobiliary art discovered by Lartet and Christie, commenting of such bone carvings, ‚ÄúThey are not the work of children. They are the childhood of art‚Äù.G. Bibby, The Testimony of the Spade (Fontana 1962) p. 79 However he was unable to accept the authenticity of the much more extensive cave art that was coming to light, conservatively and stiffly rejecting Sautuola's discovery of the paintings in Altamira as the original work of palaeolithic man.Tim Murray, Milestones in Archeology (2007) p. 246  Published works  * Mus√©e pr√©historique, (1881). * Le pr√©historique, antiquit√© de l'homme, (1882). * Les N√®gres et la civilisation √©gyptienne (1884). * Origines de la chasse, de la p√™che et de l'agriculture (1890). * Le pr√©histoire : origine et antiquit√© de l'homme, 1900.Most widely held works about Gabriel de Mortillet OCLC WorldCat See also *Henry Christie  References  Category:1821 births Category:1898 deaths Category:People from Meylan Category:French anthropologists Category:Prehistorians Category:French archaeologists ","title":"Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet"},{"id":"1964031","text":"Adin (formerly, Adinville and Aidenville) is a census-designated place in Modoc County, California. It is located 29 miles (47 km) southwest of Alturas, at an elevation of 4203 feet (1281 m). The population was 272 at the 2010 census. Each summer, the town hosts the annual Golden State Star Party, a gathering of amateur and professional astronomers from California and parts of the United States. History Adin, the first town in Modoc County west of the Warner Mountains, was founded in 1869 by Adin McDowell as the supply point for the mining town of Hayden in northern Lassen County, and was named for him in 1870. The Aidenville post office opened in 1871, and changed its name to Adin in 1876. A 1913 book described Adin as having a population of 200, and as the chief town of the Big Valley. It became a sawmill town in the mid-1930s when the Edgerton Brothers Mill moved into town, from the Adin Mountains. The town suffered devastating fires in 1904, 1915, 1931, and finally in 1939. Following the 1939 fire, the town organized a volunteer fire brigade.

Web. 24 January 2015 During the reign of William Rufus, Hamelin de Balun, founded the Benedictine priory of St Mary, at Abergavenny under the jurisdiction of the Abbey of Saint Vincent at Le Mans. The designation \\"Alien Priory\\" included any property owned by the French houses, regardless of whether there was an actual priory, or religious house, constructed upon it. Some priories enjoyed more autonomy than others. A distinction was drawn between those where the prior was appointed and served at the will of the abbot of the motherhouse, and those where the prior was elected by the monks. In the latter case, the land was vested in the priory and could not be sold by the abbot. The priories paid an apport, a nominal fixed sum, annually to the mother-house.Pearce, Christopher. \\"The Cluniacs in Wales\\", Monastic Wales A medieval abbey which held distant estates normally administered them by establishing a small cell or priory of two or three monks to manage a manor or group of manors and send the profits to the mother-house. King John compelled them to pay into the royal treasury the apport. During the reign of King Henry III (1216-1272), many alien priories were suppressed by Simon de Montfort's Parliament (the Parliament of Leicester, 1265), and their revenues were taken into the king's hands. The Crown, however, in most cases transferred the property to other monasteries. In 1294, when King Edward I of England was at war with France, many of the alien priories were seized, numbering about a hundred, and their revenues were used to help pay for the war. In order to prevent the foreign monks in southern coastal areas giving possible help to invaders, he deported many of them to other religious houses that were twenty or more miles from the coast. King Edward II of England subsequently followed this example, taking the alien priories into his own hands, but he not infrequently appointed their priors custodians for a consideration, obliging them to pay to the Crown the apport due to their superiors. When Edward III came to the throne, he restored many of the alien priories to their original owners and waived the arrears of payments due to the Crown. But ten years later, when war broke out again with France, he reverted to the policy of his predecessors, and again seized the property of these French aliens. For twenty-three years, these foreign houses remained in his hands; but with the peace of 1361 most of them were restored, only to be again sequestrated eight years later when the war was renewed. In the time of Richard II, the alien priories continued mostly in the hands of the Crown. In 1378, all the monks in alien priories were expelled from England. Most finally came to an end under Henry V in 1414, with a few exceptions surviving, for example Modbury Priory in Devon.

A co-founder of West Berlin's Zodiak Free Arts Lab, he was an early member of Tangerine Dream (1969‚Äì1970) and a founder of the band Kluster. He left Kluster in 1971, first working with his group Eruption and then focusing on solo works. Schnitzler participated in several collaborations with other electronic musicians. Biography Schnitzler was born in D√ºsseldorf. His father was German, his mother was Italian. He had a wife and they had three children,Conrad Schnitzler (1937‚Äì2011) by Geeta Dayal (20 August 2011) one of whom is son Gregor Schnitzler, who was born in 1964 in Berlin and who is a film director. Schnitzler, Dieter Moebius, and Hans-Joachim Roedelius formed Kluster in 1969 after the three had met at the Zodiak Free Arts Lab. This trio released three albums, Klopfzeichen (1970), Zwei-Osterei (1971) and Eruption (1971). When Schnitzler left the group, Roedelius and Moebius became Cluster. Around this time, Schnitzler also joined Tangerine Dream for their debut album Electronic Meditation (1970). Schitzler provided the introductory music for Norwegian black metal band Mayhem's debut EP Deathcrush in 1987, following a meeting with teenage guitarist Euronymous in the mid-1980s. The instrumental track, entitled Silvester Angfang, was randomly selected from Schnitzler's archive of works in progress. The piece is still played at most of the band's live shows. For many years Schnitzler appeared in the comics of Matt Howarth (particularly Savage Henry) as a member of the band The Bulldaggers.\\"Conrad Schnitzler in the comics\\" His 2006 work Moon Mummy is a collaboration with Matt Howarth based on an included PDF comic.

History Pinga played as forward or inside left and achieved nationwide fame at CS Mar√≠timo. In 1930 he earned his first call-up to the national team, and in the same year joined FC Porto, and became the key player of the victories in the 31‚Äì32 and 36‚Äì37 Campeonato de Portugal (the predecessor to the Cup of Portugal). He was still a playing for Porto when the forerunner of the current Primeira Liga was established. Porto was champion in the first two years of the competition. He retired in 1946 after a meniscus surgery, when such operations still carried many risks. During his career he was considered the best national player ever, with 394 goals in 400 games. He only played for two clubs, Mar√≠timo and FC Porto. He was capped 21 times for Portugal, scoring 9 goals over 12 years (1930‚Äì1942). In his first season as a football manager, he caused a massive upset when Tirsense knocked out Sporting in the Portuguese Cup. He then managed Sanjoanense and Gouveia before returning to FC Porto as assistant manager. He died in 1963, while serving as a youth team coach in Porto.

History Angelus Oaks was initially called Camp Angelus. In 1849 there was a big gold strike in Holcomb Valley, north of Bear Valley and near the town that was later to become Big Bear. The only way to get supplies in and the gold out was by mule trains. The mule train traveled up the Santa Ana River Canyon, stopping overnight in Seven Oaks and then took a switch back trail (Clark's Grade...still visible on the mountain across from the Angelus Oaks Lodge) up to the gold fields. Eventually, a wagon road was built to replace the mule skinner trail. But, the Santa Ana River kept washing out the wagon road within the rugged canyon, and so another, better road, known as a 'Control Road', (because traffic was allowed to proceed one-way in each direction only, with controls stationed at each end) was built in nearby Mill Creek Canyon. The \\"Lower Control Road\\" started at Mountain Home Village, in Mill Creek Canyon, and ended in Camp Angelus, at the Lodge. (The Lower Control Road later became known as Mountain Home Creek Road.) \\"Middle Control Road\\" started just east of the Lodge and meandered down to Seven Oaks. The final control road, 'Clark's Grade', went up and over the north side of the Santa Ana Canyon and into Bear Valley. The Clark Brothers, based at Clark's Ranch north and west of Seven Oaks, scratched out their control road by hand, and collected fees for its use. In the late 1870s, cattle rustlers, operating out of San Bernardino, would bring their stolen herds up to nearby Glen Martin, just below Camp Angelus in Mountain Home Canyon, to hide them. Due to the configuration of the opening of the mountain down by the Ranger Station, the opening to the canyon was not visible to posses passing by searching for the stolen herds. Beginning in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the stagecoach, using the old wagon road, would bring passengers and mail from Redlands up Mill Creek, then Mountain Home Creek (Lower Control Road), through Camp Angelus, on to Seven Oaks via Middle Control Road and then up the back side of the mountain to Big Bear. The now Angelus Oaks Lodge was first built as a stagecoach stop for changing horses at the top of the climb and for serving up sandwiches to passengers. It also served as a small grocery store for the local community. The original wagon road is the small road that now runs along the front of the Lodge and crosses over to the current chain up turn-out (Middle Control Road). In 1919, with automobiles now traveling up the road to Big Bear, the Angelus Oaks Lodge became a perfect spot to replenish the water in their radiators. A few cabins were built by two brothers that owned the Lodge at that time. These crude cabins were nothing more than four walls and contained only cots for sleeping and a wood-burning stove for heat and cooking. The original school was a log cabin on a hill located behind and rented from Glen Lodge. This lodge had a full restaurant, bar, gas and repair station, grocery store, hotel, cabins, and a dance hall with a large fireplace. In 1953 the first teacher, originally from South Dakota and a graduate of USC, was Orville Young. He lived with his family in Camp Angelus and taught the community children from five to 13 years of age at Camp Angelus Elementary. In 1956 the natural wood clad (later painted red) one-room school-house serving grades one through seven was built, and closed permanently in 2004. Glen Lodge burned down in the late Sixties. In the 1970s, when the postal service decided to combine the two small post offices of Camp Angelus and Seven Oaks, closing the Seven Oaks location, they renamed the remaining office \\"Angelus Oaks\\". That name stuck with the town. It was at this time that the Lodge was abandoned and fell into disrepair. In 1987, the lodge was purchased by a couple living at that time in Long Beach, California. The lodge and cabins were restored over a two-year period and heaters and showers were added to the cabins. The lodge and surrounding cabins became a livable resort for individuals wanting to get away from the hectic city life below. Over the years, full bathrooms, kitchens, and even some dividing walls for bedrooms were added. Beginning in 2012 and continuing through 2015, the Lodge and its outer cabins once again underwent a major restoration. As of January 2015, eight of the original 12 cabins have been completely restored, and the Lodge is open for viewing. The cabins are available to rent on a nightly basis and are operated under a special use permit provided by the USDA Forest Service. On February 12, 2013, in a rural area east of Angelus Oaks, the search for Christopher Dorner ended after a standoff with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. He was the primary suspect in a series of shootings. Present day The Oaks Restaurant, the only restaurant in Angelus Oaks, CA. Its downtown consists of a general store, a restaurant, a post office (ZIP Code 92305) and a real estate office. A San Bernardino County Fire Station (Station 98) is also downtown, and a San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department Resident Deputy (one of only three in the entire County) lives nearby. The State of California's Department of Transportation (CalTrans) and the United States Forest Service also have a presence in downtown Angelus Oaks. Two private water companies service the residents of Angelus Oaks. Within the town lies the historical Angelus Oaks Lodge, which originally served as a stagecoach stop for passengers traveling up the mountain to Big Bear, and is now available for overnight visitors. Angelus Oaks has become a favorite to bicyclists due to its proximity to the Santa Ana River Trail (S.A.R.T.) which is renowned for its grandeur and challenge. For hikers, Angelus Oaks offers the San Bernardino Peak Hiking Trail (1W07) and the Vivian Creek Trail. There are also other less vigorous trails situated throughout the San Gorgonio Wilderness. The Angelus Oaks Lodge offers a great overnight and staging area for bikers and hikers wishing to get an early morning start. A few miles past Angelus Oaks, in the Barton Flats area, there are multiple public Forest Service campsites and group camps run by various churches and non-profit organizations, including YMCA and Jewish Community Center of Orange County. The two largest and most active camps are the Boy Scout Camp Tahquitz owned by the Long Beach Boy Scouts (it was developed from a very private summer tent camp with one snack store to one serving thousands of Scouts year round with a mess hall, clinic, garage/fire station, swimming and fishing lake, camp offices, and rangers' quarters developed, built, and maintained under the watchful eye of the Camp Ranger, Glen McIntosh, from 1957 until his death in 1981), and Camp Cedar Falls, 3 miles (5 km) past Angelus Oaks on Highway 38 run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Jenks Lake hosts fishing and some swimming activities.

It is south-southwest of Colfax, and northeast of Auburn. The city's msl elevation is . Its ZIP code is 95703 and its area code 530. Applegate was originally settled in 1849 by Lisbon Applegate, who came to California with his son, George, from Missouri. Part of a family that first emigrated to America in the 17th century, the Applegates bought acreage above Clipper Gap, California, and established a fruit ranch there. The main house of the Applegate Ranch was where Oliver's gas station and bar sits today. Lisbon eventually returned to Missouri but his son, George W. Applegate, stayed. As the town grew, it was called Bear River House for its proximity to the Bear River, a short distance northwest. When a post office was established in 1855, the community officially became known as Lisbon in honor of its founder. George W. Applegate became postmaster, and in the 1870s, the settlement was renamed Applegate, also to honor its founder. At one time, Applegate was a station on the Central Pacific Railroad (later Southern Pacific). When a second track was added in 1929, the station on the eastbound track was named East Applegate.

The film's original script was loosely based on the 1954 science fiction short story \\"The Golden Man\\" by Philip K. Dick. The film tells the story of Cris Johnson, a small-time magician based in Las Vegas, who has limited precognition; his ability allows him to see into the very immediate future. His gift makes him not only a target of a highly motivated and heavily armed group of terrorists, but also wanted by the FBI to help them fight those same terrorists. The film was released on April 25, 2007, in Belgium and France, and on April 27, 2007, in the United States by Paramount Pictures. With a production budget of $78 million, the film grossed $76 million worldwide, making it a box office flop. It was the only Revolution Studios film to be distributed by Paramount Pictures until 2017's XXX: Return of Xander Cage. Plot Cris Johnson can see into his future. He can only see two minutes ahead, with the exception of a vision he once had of a woman walking into a diner. Knowing no details other than the time, he goes to the diner twice each day at 9:08 to await her arrival. He works as a small-time magician in Las Vegas, where he supplements his income with gambling, using his powers to win medium amounts against the house. Cris draws the attention of FBI agent Callie Ferris, who has figured out his ability and wants to stop Russian terrorists from detonating a nuclear weapon. Before she can approach Cris, his gambling draws the attention of casino security. Using his ability to forecast the actions of his pursuers, he eludes them and the Las Vegas police. Ferris tracks Cris to his location, but he escapes after foreseeing her arrival. Later that night, the casino's security chief is approached by two of the terrorists, is interrogated about Johnson and is then killed. The following morning, Cris is at the diner again when he sees Liz Cooper, the woman from his vision. It turns out that Cris can not only see the future, but also see how his actions can affect that future. When Liz's aggressive ex-boyfriend arrives, Johnson envisions all outcomes of his intervening, and then chooses the outcome that gets him \\"in\\" with Liz. Knowing that she is heading for Flagstaff, Arizona, Cris tricks her into giving him a ride. Ferris follows, while the terrorists decide to kill him. With the weapon tracked to Los Angeles, Ferris convinces her superiors to let her bring Cris in. The terrorists follow in the hope that the agents will lead them to Cris. Cris and Liz have to spend the night in a motel. Ferris confronts Liz near the hotel. Claiming Cris is a dangerous sociopath, Ferris asks Liz to drug Cris so that they can bring him in peacefully. Instead, Liz warns Cris, who tells her his secret. When she asks why he will not help the FBI stop the terrorists, he explains his limitations, noting the exception for events involving her. Cris tries to escape from the FBI but is captured after saving Ferris from logs tumbling down the side of a mountain. Unable to get to Cris, the terrorists kidnap Liz. The FBI strap Cris to a chair and force him to watch television until he has a vision that can help. They expect him to see a report about the detonation of the bomb, but instead he envisions a broadcast from several hours in the future in which Liz is killed with a bomb vest while strapped to a wheelchair as bait for him. Cris escapes and races to the parking garage where she will be killed. Catching up to him, Ferris promises to help save Liz as long as Cris will help stop the bomb; she also sets up a plan to draw out the terrorists. Cris helps the FBI track the terrorists to the port where they are based. When they arrive, Cris is able to walk right up to the terrorist leader while using his power to dodge bullets. After killing the terrorists and saving Liz, they find that the bomb has already been moved. Ferris shows Cris a seismograph, hoping that he will see any tremors caused by explosions before they happen. As he stares at the screen he realizes that he has made a mistake and that he was too late: the bomb detonates out at sea and completely destroys the port, as well as the rest of the city. The timeline reverts a full day to Cris and Liz in bed at the hotel in Arizona, before Ferris arrived. Because of Liz's involvement in events, Cris has now been able to envision everything that could happen leading to the nuclear explosion. \\"Every time you look into the future, it changes.\\" Cris calls Ferris and offers to help prevent the nuclear disaster, then asks Liz to wait for him. Cast Production Gary Goldman and Jason Koornick initially optioned the science fiction short story \\"The Golden Man\\" by Philip K. Dick. Goldman wrote a script treatment that he and Koornick presented to Nicolas Cage's production company, Saturn Films, but Goldman ended up writing the screenplay on spec. =Original draft= This first draft had more similarities to the short story, detailing the efforts of a government agency to capture and contain a precognitive mutant.http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Next-GaryGoldman.pdf To provide greater interaction between the opposing parties (as well as create a leading role), Cris was changed from a feral animal whose existence threatened humanity's into a more familiar and understandable social outcast. A romantic subplot was added: the character of Liz Cooper, who in this draft was not only destined to be the love of Cris's life, but a mutant as well (born in Love Canal) and the only woman he has ever met with whom he can have children, herself incapable of procreating with normal humans. As the original short story had a distinct tone of racist paranoia, the motivation for the pursuit of Cris was changed from an ironclad policy of exterminating mutations to a manipulative Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent's obsessive search for unconventional assets in the war on terror. This script was filled with anti-authoritarian themes, with Cris often speaking clearly and eloquently of how he enjoys his independence. He states plainly that \\"what I want is freedom. And you don't get it by giving it up.\\" The DHS is explicitly depicted as a completely unregulated, astoundingly powerful and unapologetically ruthless collection of fanatics, breaking laws without consideration and eager to torture and even murder innocent civilians to achieve their objectives. They discuss their plans in using Cris as if he were a piece of machinery, most of which consist of using him as a \\"timescope\\": that is, bolting him into a chair for the rest of his life so his only experiences are ones which are useful to them, a process which they believe would extend the range of his abilities. One agent suggests that they amputate his arms and legs, a suggestion his colleague considers humorous. However, his enemies are skilled tormentors and eventually they drive him to the breaking point: when the DHS learns that Liz is pregnant with his child, they coldly decide to have her executed at a pre-determined time, thus pre-emptively proving to Cris their determination to possess him. He attempts to secure Liz's safety, but the DHS captures her. In retaliation, he demolishes the Las Vegas DHS headquarters with a barrel of C-4 explosive agents had seized earlier in a warrant-less search. He and Liz are the only survivors. =Saturn re-draft= Saturn Films had the script extensively rewritten and in the process almost completely eliminated its anti-authoritarian themes. Though Cris remained a meek social outcast, he is somewhat less sympathetic: he is portrayed as arrogant, as well as far more prone to applying violent solutions. The DHS's role was replaced with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Despite a scene in which Cris experiences his worst nightmare ‚Äì spending the rest of his life strapped into a chair with his eyes wedged open ‚Äì the authorities are portrayed as sympathetic and Cris as uncooperative and belligerent. Their insistence on his obedience is reduced to the point that the authorities offer their assistance in rescuing Liz (whom they neglect to arrest despite her efforts to sabotage Cris's capture) from the terrorists. This leads to the film's greatest variation from the original draft ‚Äì a confrontation with the terrorists. No clue is given as to the motivation for the terrorists' detonation of the nuclear device in Los Angeles. The few terrorists who speak in the film with British, French and German accents, seem to be under the guidance of an unseen leader who has told them that they must kill Cris since \\"he says that Cris is the only threat to the plan\\". During the confrontation with the terrorists, Cris willingly supports the FBI with his abilities in a series of sequences similar to those in the original script, only with the authorities as allies instead of antagonists. This was the script Saturn Films brought to the attention of Revolution Studios. Revolution Studios acquired the screenplay and in November 2004, Revolution Studios hired Lee Tamahori to direct the film, with Cage in the lead role. Filming was to begin in summer 2005. In December 2005, Moore was cast as the federal agent who seeks people to help prevent future terrorism and uncovers Cage's character as a potential candidate. In November 2005, Initial Entertainment Group negotiated for rights of international distribution of Next, which had a target release date of 2007. In February 2006, actress Jessica Biel was cast as the love interest of Cage's character. In May 2006, Starz! Entertainment's 14-episode reality television miniseries, Looking for Stars, gave 200 contestants the opportunity to earn a speaking role in Next, which was won by actor Marcus Welch. =Filming= Sections of the film were filmed in the San Bernardino Mountains in California. Mountain locations used in production of the film included Crestline, Running Springs and Big Bear Lake. The hotel featured in the film, \\"The Cliffhanger\\", is actually a restaurant overlooking the City of San Bernardino. In order to make the restaurant look more like a hotel, a facade was attached to the building. The facade is the section of the motel where Johnson and Liz Cooper were staying. Interior shots were filmed elsewhere. Following the end of production, the facade was removed. However, remnants of the signage placed and the paint works conducted remain intact. Running Springs served for scenes shot in the town. Scenes (in which a vehicle was rolled off the side of a cliff) shot in Big Bear Lake were shot at a campground. Due to the terrain located on the side of the cliff the Cliffhanger is located on, the producers decided to finish the scenes at the campground in Big Bear Lake.Paramount Pictures Corporation, Next DVD Next originally was to be distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment (which had a deal with Revolution), set to be released on September 28, 2006, but that studio dumped it in January 2007, and Paramount Pictures subsequently picked it up and released the film on April 27, 2007. Reception = Box office = The film opened at #3 at the U.S. box office, grossing $7.1 million in 2,725 theaters in its opening weekend. In its eight-week run in the United States, it grossed a total of just $18 million and has a combined worldwide gross of $76 million. Compared to other films based on Philip K. Dick stories, Next grossed less than Minority Report, Total Recall, Paycheck and Blade Runner but performed better than Impostor, Screamers and A Scanner Darkly. =Critical response= Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 28% based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Numerous plot holes and poorly motivated characters prevent Next from being the thought-provoking sci-fi flick it could've been.\\" Metacritic gives the film had an average score of 42 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Justin Chang of Variety said the film plays \\"like the cinematic equivalent of a Choose Your Own Adventure novel\\" and that the plot is highly reminiscent of 24. Chang also said \\"What starts out as a mildly diverting thriller blows itself to smithereens in the final reel\\", describing the climax as a \\"stunning cheat.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film 2¬Ω out of 4 stars and said parts of the film are \\"fascinating\\" and \\"compelling\\" but that \\"the whole thing ends up collapsing under its own weight.\\" Berardinelli said Nicolas Cage \\"seems to be going through the motions\\", \\"Julianne Moore brings intensity to the part of Callie, although the character is incomplete\\", \\"Jessica Biel is appealing\\" but \\"the character is unfinished\\", and that \\"Thomas Kretschmann is unimpressive as a generic 24-style terrorist.\\" He also said \\"some viewers will feel cheated by what Next does, and it's hard to blame them.\\" Connie Ogle of the Miami Herald gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said the film looks like director Lee Tamahori \\"spent about 12 bucks on his special effects budget.\\" Ogle said the film had a decent premise but \\"Next begins to seriously embarrass itself and its stars once it rolls to its climax.\\" Toronto Star film critic Peter Howell gave the film 1¬Ω stars out of 4 and called it a \\"colossal waste of time\\" and said it is \\"possibly the most egregious befouling of Dick's work to date.\\" Howell said the roles \\"seem to be cut-and-pasted from other movies\\", called the film a \\"straight-to-DVD wannabe\\", and said the film \\"has one of the most infuriating endings ever.\\" Moira MacDonald of the Seattle Times gave Next 1¬Ω stars out of 4 and said \\"Late in the movie, Cris shouts at a bad guy, 'I've seen every possible ending here. None of them are good for you.' It's as if he's talking to the audience, and alas, he's right.\\" and \\"Julianne Moore spends most of her screen time in Lee Tamahori's confused sci-fi thriller Next looking royally pissed off, like she got tricked into making the movie on a sucker bet. You can't blame her; this film's audience is likely to look that way as well by the time the end credits roll.\\" Kalamazoo Gazette critic James Sanford gave the film 1¬Ω stars and said \\"the only visions Next inspires are flashbacks to better films\\" like Honeymoon in Vegas, Leaving Las Vegas, The Illusionist, and Hannibal, adding \\"any film that makes someone wish he or she were watching Hannibal must be pretty awful.\\" Sanford said \\"Cage performs as if he's on autopilot, Moore looks more miserable than she did as the suicidal housewife in The Hours, and Biel seems fully aware she was hired only to provide a few glimpses of cheesecake.\\" Sanford also remarked, \\"the ending of this film is not just a colossal cheat, it's a hard slap in the face to anyone who has invested his or her time in watching it.\\" Daniel Eagan of Film Journal International said the film \\"follows a familiar Hollywood pattern in which a few intriguing ideas are swamped by the demands of a big-budget, star-driven vehicle\\" and that it \\"won't add any luster to Nicolas Cage's resume.\\" Eagan said \\"Half of Next is a clever, unpredictable thriller that plays with Dick's customary obsessions with time and reality. The other half is a sloppy, bloated adventure marred by cheesy special effects and some equally cheesy acting\\" and also that \\"the script to Next has plenty of [plot jams], one or two egregious enough to demand ticket refunds.\\" Orlando Sentinel critic Roger Moore gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and said \\"who says preposterous junk can't be fun?\\" Moore said \\"this sloppy little time travel variation is a crowd-pleasing hoot, thanks mostly to Cage turning on the charisma and showing off his gift for hangdog understatement\\" and that the Groundhog Day-like attempts to woo Jessica Biel's character are \\"hilarious.\\" Moore concluded \\"It's all so stupid and ends so perfunctorily that you can't call Next good, or even as good as the dopey D√©j√† Vu...but it does score over [D√©j√† Vu] in one important criterion. It's just fun.\\" Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe gave the film 2¬Ω out of 4 stars and called it a \\"watchably absurd popcorn flick\\" and that the film \\"bears almost no resemblance\\" to the original short story \\"The Golden Man\\", the short story it was adapted from. He described Moore's performance as \\"enjoyably curt\\" and said \\"alongside Cage's spontaneity, Biel seems humorless and earnestly dull.\\" Morris said the film is fun \\"until it turns crass\\" and concluded, \\"when you're being toyed with that cheaply, you forget how much you admire Nicolas Cage's shamelessness and start to resent the movie's.\\" Diana Saenger of ReviewExpress gave the film 3¬Ω stars and said \\"Next boasts a fresh plot with a tricky twist ending that can be misconstrued if you don't pay close attention and then pause to think about it.\\" Saenger reported that it was Nicolas Cage's idea for Cris to be a magician, and that it was his suggestion that his wife be part of the scene where a woman comes out of the audience to be part of the magic show. Saenger remarked that people complaining about the twist being a rip-off probably didn't understand it and said it made perfect sense and concluded \\"I liked the surprise twist and found Next very entertaining.\\" The film was subject to the heckling of Bridget Jones Nelson and Michael J. Nelson in an October 2007 installment of Rifftrax.

King Solomon is said to have used it in the building of the First Temple in Jerusalem in the place of cutting tools. For the building of the Temple, which promoted peace, it was inappropriate to use tools that could also cause war and bloodshed. Referenced throughout the Talmud and the Midrashim, the Shamir was reputed to have existed in the time of Moses, as one of the ten wonders created on the eve of the first Sabbath, just before YHWH finished creation.Pirkei Avot 5:9 Moses reputedly used the Shamir to engrave the Hoshen (Priestly breastplate) stones that were inserted into the breastplate. King Solomon, aware of the existence of the Shamir, but unaware of its location, commissioned a search that turned up a \\"grain of Shamir the size of a barley- corn\\". Solomon's artisans reputedly used the Shamir in the construction of Solomon's Temple. The material to be worked, whether stone, wood or metal, was affected by being \\"shown to the Shamir.\\" Following this line of logic (anything that can be 'shown' something must have eyes to see), early Rabbinical scholars described the Shamir almost as a living being. Other early sources, however, describe it as a green stone. For storage, the Shamir was meant to have been always wrapped in wool and stored in a container made of lead; any other vessel would burst and disintegrate under the Shamir's gaze. The Shamir was said to have been either lost or had lost its potency (along with the \\"dripping of the honeycomb\\") by the time of the destruction of the First Temple at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C. Asmodeus According to the deutero-canonical Asmodeus legend, the shamir was given to Solomon as a gift from Asmodeus, the king of demons. Another version of the story holds that a captured Asmodeus told Solomon the Shamir was entrusted to the care of a woodcock. Solomon then sends his trusted aide Benaiah on a quest to retrieve it. Gemstones The shamir worm was also used by King Solomon to engrave gemstones. Apparently he also used the blood of the shamir worm to make carved jewels with a mystical seal or design. According to an interview with Dr. George Frederick Kunz, an expert in gemstone and jewelry lore, this led to the belief that gemstones so engraved would have magical virtues, and they often also ended up with their own powers or guardian angel associated with either the gem, or the specifically engraved gemstones.‚ÄúGardens in Midair.‚Äù The Washington Post. August 4, 1895, page 20. Quran The Quran mentions the shamir when pointing out the ignorance of the jinn who worked for Solomon concerning the occult, and emphasizing that all knowledge rests only with God: According to commentators such as Ibn Abbas, when Solomon died his body remained leaning on his staff for a long time, nearly a year, until \\"a creature of the earth, which was a kind of worm,\\" gnawed through the stick weakening it and the body fell to the ground. It was then that the jinn knew that he had died a long time before and until then they were working hard thinking they were being supervised by him. It also became clear to humans who divined and engaged in occult activities or spirit-consulting, or worshiped the jinn that they do not possess knowledge of the occult. In popular culture Leonard Tushnet's story \\"The Worm Shamir,\\" published in the December 1968\\"The Worm Shamir\\" issue of Fantasy & Science Fiction, retells the legend in modern, quasi-scientific terms.

For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Avila Beach as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. The population was 1,627 at the 2010 census. History The name Avila commemorates Miguel √Åvila, who was granted Rancho San Miguelito in 1842. The town was established in the latter half of the 19th century, when it served as the main shipping port for San Luis Obispo. Around this time, Luigi Marre built a honeymoon hotel here and steamboats brought customers from San Francisco and Los Angeles.David W. Kean, Wide Places in the California Roads: The encyclopedia of California's small towns and the roads that lead to them (Volume 1 of 4: Southern California Counties), p. 19 Although Avila Beach still has a working commercial fishing pier and the inland areas have extensive apple orchards, tourism is now the main industry. There are few historical structures remaining; among the oldest is the Point San Luis Light, built in 1890 after a series of shipping accidents. In the late 1990s, Unocal began the cleanup of decades old oil seepage discovered years earlier from corroding pipes under the township, and which had caused a massive oil spill under the town. Over 6,750 truckloads of contaminated material was sent to a Bakersfield landfill, and replaced with clean Guadalupe Dunes sand. Many of the town's homes and businesses, including several blocks of Front Street, were razed as a result of the quarter-mile-wide excavation. New buildings, homes, businesses, modern walkways and sea motif walls and benches have been constructed. Geography The beach is less than 0.5 miles (0.8 km) long and sheltered in San Luis Bay, which is formed by Point San Luis on the west and Fossil Point on the east. Avila Beach faces south and the 600 foot elevation of Point San Luis breaks the prevailing northwesterly winds. It is therefore usually warmer than the other beaches on the Central Coast. Most of Avila Beach is undeveloped, except for a few blocks adjacent to the beach with homes, hotels, and small businesses, and a few upscale housing developments inland near a golf course. Avila Beach is also known for its hot springs, which are used for resort spas. U.S. Route 101 and State Highway 1 bypass this part of the coastline to the east in favor of a more direct route from Pismo Beach north to San Luis Obispo. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 6.0 square miles (15.6 km2), 99.71% of it land, and 0.29% of it water.  Climate  Average temperatures vary little during the year, ranging from to from November through April, and from to from May through October. Average annual rainfall is . Along with much of the California coast, winter is the wet season, with more than 70% of the yearly rain falling from December through March, while summer brings drought conditions. Demographics The 2010 United States Census reported that Avila Beach had a population of 1,627. The population density was 269.9 people per square mile (104.2/km2). The racial makeup of Avila Beach was 1,507 (92.6%) White, 13 (0.8%) African American, 7 (0.4%) Native American, 33 (2.0%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 34 (2.1%) from other races, and 33 (2.0%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 111 persons (6.8%). The Census reported that 1,627 people (100% of the population) lived in households, 0 (0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized. There were 842 households, out of which 115 (13.7%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 416 (49.4%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 39 (4.6%) had a female householder with no husband present, 16 (1.9%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 36 (4.3%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 14 (1.7%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 296 households (35.2%) were made up of individuals, and 108 (12.8%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.93. There were 471 families (55.9% of all households); the average family size was 2.45.

Points of interest Humpback whales are becoming features for local tourism. Avila Beach has three piers: Avila Beach Pier, in length, is open to tourist strolling and recreational fishing; Harford Pier, which is for commercial fishing boats to offload their wares since 1873; and the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly SLO) Pier, part of the university's marine research program, is not publicly accessible. In recent years, the pier has become a site for whale watching as numbers of grays and humpback whales come into bays around the pier to feed and draw crowds during the seasons.

Previously the school was known as Audenshaw Grammar School and Audenshaw School. Audenshaw Grammar school opened to boys in 1932. History On 29 July 1932, Audenshaw Grammar School for Boys was opened, providing facilities for 300 pupils. \\"The school officially opened on Saturday July 23rd at 3.00 pm when the contractors handed the keys to County Alderman J. T. Travis Clegg DL JP. The school remained open until 7:00 pm for inspection by the general public. On 13 September 1932, seventy-six boys walked through the gates of a brand new Grammar School on Hazel Street Audenshaw.\\" The first Head Master was John Lord, who was in charge until 1953. He was followed by Ronald Porter, who had joined the school from Stretford Grammar School. Kenneth Exley became Headmaster in 1961, having previously been Headmaster at the Creighton School for Boys in Carlisle. In 1981, Graham Locke OBE succeeded Exley as Head Master. Locke was Head Master until his sudden death in 1994; the school's sports hall is named in his memory. Locke was later appointed to the Order of the British Empire for his role for services to education. Alan Crompton was Head Master from 1994 to 2005, whereupon he retired. Crompton had previously worked at Copley High School in Stalybridge. He was widely regarded as one of the most outstanding Head Masters of his generation. When Crompton retired he was succeeded by Stephen Turner, who joined the school having been Head at Golborne High School in Wigan ‚Äì he retired in 2012. The current Head is Jeanette Saw was appointed in June 2013. In 1989, Audenshaw became one of the first Grant Maintained (GM) schools in England under the leadership of Locke and the then Chair of Governors T. Hall. The school had faced the threat of a merger and then closure. The LEA attempted to sell the school land but a High Court ruling overturned this action. The school opted out of LEA control in 1988; parents voted for the maintenance ‚Äì 86% of those eligible voted; 91% of them voting in favour of the school receiving grant maintenance. This followed the Parents Action Group campaign. Since then the school has grown and has become one of the most popular schools in Tameside. Mr T Hall was awarded the MBE for services to Education and he remains the Chair of Governors. In the mid-1960s pupils of Audenshaw Grammar School formed a branch of the Peak Forest Canal Restoration Society. Founding members W. Lear, N. Markham, and W. Morgan began their efforts in the summer of 1965 with the objective of cleaning, restoring and reopening the then derelict Ashton Canal. Successful in their ambitious aim, the canal was eventually reopened on 13 May 1974 by Denis Howel, then Member of Parliament for Birmingham Small Heath and the Minister for Sport.. Audenshaw Grammar School lost its sixth form in the late 1970s due to ‚Äòreorganisation‚Äô within the LEA. However, an adjoining sixth form college was opened in 1997, the same year the school was granted foundation school status but this time it was co-educational rather than single-sex, gaining fairly mixed results. The school also became fully comprehensive in the late 1970s. The sixth form was announced to close in June 2018. It will officially close in June 2019 after the final year has taken their exams. In 1999, Audenshaw School won the inaugural ‚Äì and only ‚Äì schools' series of Channel 4's daytime quiz show Fifteen to One. The Queen Mother visited the school in 1959 to present colours to the Manchester Regiment. In 2007, the school celebrated its 75th anniversary with a visit by the Princess Royal who officially opened the Sixth Form extension. In 2019 Audenshaw School‚Äôs sixth form closed due to its small size, and thus not securing enough funding after government cuts, making it economically unviable for the school as a whole.

Life Kaplan was born in M√ºrzzuschlag, Austria into a railroad worker's family. He graduated from high school in Vienna in 1895, after which he attended the Technical University of Vienna, where he studied civil engineering and specialised in diesel engines. From 1900 to 1901 he was drafted into military service in Pula. After working in Vienna with a specialisation in motors, he moved to the German Technical University in Brno to conduct research at the institute of civil engineering. He spent the next three decades of his life in Brno, and nearly all his inventions and research are connected with his professorship there. In 1913 he was appointed head of the institute for water turbines. In 1912 he published his most notable work: the Kaplan turbine, a revolutionary water turbine that was especially fitted to produce electricity from large streams with only a moderate incline. From 1912 to 1913 he received four patents on these kinds of turbines. In 1918 the first Kaplan turbine with 26 kW power and a diameter of 60 cm was built by the Storek construction company for a textile manufacturer in Lower Austria. This turbine was used until 1955 and today is exhibited at the Technisches Museum Wien. After the success of the first Kaplan turbines they started being used worldwide and remain one of the most widely used kinds of water turbines. In 1926 and 1934 Kaplan received honorary doctorates.

Summary Hill House is a mansion in a location that is never specified but is between many hills. The story concerns four main characters: Dr. John Montague, an investigator of the supernatural; Eleanor Vance, a shy young woman who resents having lived as a recluse caring for her demanding disabled mother; Theodora, a flamboyant, bohemian artist; and Luke Sanderson, the young heir to Hill House, who is host to the others. Dr. Montague hopes to find scientific evidence of the existence of the supernatural. He rents Hill House for a summer and invites as his guests several people whom he has chosen because of their experiences with paranormal events. Of these, only Eleanor and Theodora accept. Eleanor travels to the house, where she and Theodora will live in isolation with Montague and Luke. Hill House has two caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, who refuse to stay near the house at night. The blunt and single-minded Mrs. Dudley is a source of some comic relief. The four overnight visitors begin to form friendships as Dr. Montague explains the building's history, which encompasses suicide and other violent deaths. All four of the inhabitants begin to experience strange events while in the house, including unseen noises and ghosts roaming the halls at night, strange writing on the walls, and other unexplained events. Eleanor tends to experience phenomena to which the others are oblivious. At the same time, Eleanor may be losing touch with reality, and the narrative implies that at least some of what Eleanor witnesses may be products of her imagination. Another implied possibility is that Eleanor possesses a subconscious telekinetic ability that is itself the cause of many of the disturbances experienced by her and other members of the investigative team (which might indicate there is no ghost in the house at all). This possibility is suggested especially by references early in the novel to Eleanor's childhood memories about episodes of a poltergeist-like entity that seemed to involve mainly her. Later in the novel, the bossy and arrogant Mrs. Montague and her companion Arthur Parker, the headmaster of a boys‚Äô school, arrive to spend a weekend at Hill House and to help investigate it. They, too, are interested in the supernatural, including s√©ances and spirit writing. Unlike the other four characters, they do not experience anything supernatural, although some of Mrs. Montague's alleged spirit writings seem to communicate with Eleanor. Mrs. Montague's haughtiness and self-importance provide another source of comic relief. Much of the supernatural phenomena that occur are described only vaguely, or else are partly hidden from the characters themselves. Eleanor and Theodora are in a bedroom with an unseen force trying the door, and Eleanor believes after the fact that the hand she was holding in the darkness was not Theodora's. In one episode, as Theodora and Eleanor walk outside Hill House at night, they see a ghostly family picnic that seems to be taking place in daylight. Theodora screams in fear for Eleanor to run, warning her not to look back, though the book never explains what Theodora sees. By this point in the book, it is becoming clear to the characters that the house is beginning to possess Eleanor. Fearing for her safety, Dr. Montague and Luke declare that she must leave. Eleanor, however, regards the house as her home and resists. Dr. Montague and Luke force her into her car; she bids them farewell and drives off, but before leaving the property grounds she propels the car into a large oak tree, and it is assumed that she is killed. In the short, final paragraph that follows, the reader is left uncertain whether Eleanor was simply an emotionally disturbed woman who committed suicide, or whether her death at Hill House has a supernatural significance. She is revealed to have died in the same spot where the original owner also perished. Reception and legacy In a New York Times review in 1959, Edmund Fuller wrote, \\"With her 'conceit' of Hill House, whether pretty be the name for it or not, Shirley Jackson proves again that she is the finest master currently practicing in the genre of the cryptic, haunted tale.\\" Stephen King, in his book Danse Macabre (1981), a non-fiction review of the horror genre, lists The Haunting of Hill House as one of the finest horror novels of the late 20th century and provides a lengthy review. According to The Wall Street Journal, the book is \\"now widely regarded as the greatest haunted-house story ever written.\\" In his review column for The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Damon Knight selected the novel as one of the 10 best genre books of 1959, declaring it \\"in a class by itself.\\"\\"Books\\", The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, April 1960, p.98 Reappraising the book in The Guardian in 2010, Sophie Missing wrote, \\"Jackson treats her material ‚Äì which could be reduced to penny dreadful stuff in less deft hands ‚Äì with great skill and subtlety. [‚Ä¶] The horror inherent in the novel does not lie in Hill House (monstrous though it is) or the events that take place within it, but in the unexplored recesses of its characters' ‚Äì and its readers' ‚Äì minds. This is perhaps why it remains the definitive haunted house story\\". In 2018, The New York Times polled 13 writers to choose the scariest book of fiction they have ever read, and Carmen Maria Machado and Neil Gaiman both chose The Haunting of Hill House. Carmen Maria Machado wrote in The Atlantic about her experience discovering The Haunting of Hill House. She was at a writer's retreat while working on her short story \\"The Resident,\\" and was told her story reminded readers of Shirley Jackson. Having read little of Jackson, Machado decided to read Hill House: \\"When I went back home to Philly, I picked up a copy. And I just devoured it. I read it in one sitting. I started reading one night, and when my girlfriend (now wife) went to bed I just kept reading. It scared the shit out of me. Even though the events that appear to be supernatural activity are few and far between, those scenes are so chillingly written‚Äîas if Jackson was describing a phenomenon she‚Äôd seen before and really understood. The book‚Äôs particular brand of surreality felt, to me, like that experience of walking home from a party a little bit drunk, when the world somehow seems sharper and clearer and weirder.\\" Adaptations =Film= The novel has been adapted to film twice, in 1963 and again in 1999, both times under the title The Haunting. The 1963 version is a relatively faithful adaptation and received critical praise. The 1999 version, considerably different from the novel and widely panned by critics, is an overt fantasy horror in which all the main characters are terrorized and two are killed by explicitly supernatural deaths. It was also parodied in Scary Movie 2 (2001). The plot of The Legend of Hell House and the book on which it is based, Hell House both written by Richard Matheson, have several details in common with Jackson‚Äôs novel (and the movie adaptation The Haunting (1963 film)) in which a party of four (some psychic, some skeptical, some British, some Americans) stay in an extremely haunted Gothic mansion house with a terrible history, for the purposes of scientific study, and all are plagued by unseen terrors. It is to both of the films‚Äô credit that they only partially resemble each other. =Theater= It was first adapted for the stage in 1964 by F. Andrew Leslie. In 2015, Anthony Neilson prepared a new stage adaptation for Sonia Friedman and Hammer for production at the Liverpool Playhouse. =Radio= In 1997, The Haunting of Hill House was abridged for radio by Alison Joseph and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in eight 15-minute episodes, read by Emma Fielding. =Television= A loose television adaptation was released in 2018 to critical acclaim. It changed many elements from the novel, keeping mainly its Hill House setting, Mr and Mrs Dudley, and a few character names, but shifted the focus to members of a singular haunted \\"Crain family.\\" It was directed by Mike Flanagan and was produced for Netflix. Varying from the novel, the series depicted the married couple and their five children being terrorized by the house for decades of their lives.

He was an editor of campus humor magazine The Yale Record.Yale Banner. New Haven: Yale University Press. 1942. p. 96. During his senior year at Yale, Waugh enlisted in the United States Navy Air Corps and, after graduation, received his aviator's wings. He served in Panama for two years, flying various types of aircraft. While in military service, Waugh turned his hand to creative writing, completing and publishing his first novel Madam Will Not Dine Tonight in 1947. He quickly published two more novels, but they were not very well received. In 1949, as the result of reading a case book on true crime, Waugh decided to explore a realistic crime novel. With the cooperation of his fianc√©e, who was a student at Smith College, Waugh set his police procedural Last Seen Wearing ... in a fictional women's college. Published in 1952, the book was a significant success and is now considered a pioneering effort exploring relentless police work and attention to detail.

His first title was Mr Britain in 1946. He then won the Mr Universe in 1951, 1958 and 1965. He also starred in five films, four featured as Hercules, and in one, Hercules in the Haunted World (1961), he co- starred with Christopher Lee. Besides his own career and titles, he is probably best known as an idol and mentor to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Biography Roy Park was born in Leeds, West Yorkshire on 7 June 1928 Showing athletic interests early in life, Park dedicated his teenage years to excelling in football where he played in the reserves for Leeds United.\\"Arnold Schwarzenegger reveals Leeds United connection\\". Yorkshire Evening Post. Retrieved 22 March 2017. He had no specific interest in bodybuilding until age 16 when he met muscleman David Cohen. Upon learning that Cohen lifted weights at his friend's house, Park joined in out of curiosity. Park's legendary physique would begin to grow from barbells, dumbbells and a simple chinning bar. During his national service he was a Physical Training Instructor in Singapore. Upon discharge from the British Army in 1948, he witnessed his first physique contest; the inaugural NABBA Mr. Universe contest in London, in which John Grimek edged out Steve Reeves in controversial fashion. It was this contest that inspired Park to compete himself. After one year of hard training, Park earned the title of Mr. Britain in 1949. He then subsequently spent six months in the United States (thanks to a gift from his parents). There, he met up with publisher Joe Weider, who began to feature the Englishman prominently in his muscle magazines. The next year, Park was runner-up to Steve Reeves in the 1950 NABBA Amateur Mr. Universe in London (also a close contest). After a second full year of training, Park broke what had been an American monopoly on bodybuilding titles by winning the 1951 National Amateur Bodybuilders Association (NABBA) Amateur Mr. Universe. He cemented his status by winning the 1958 and 1965 NABBA Pro Mr. Universe titles. Standing 6'1\\" and with a top weight of 250 pounds, Park was known for his muscular mass and was a forerunner to modern bodybuilding. Park was also renowned for his strength, which he often demonstrated in contests and strongman exhibitions. He is on record as the second man to bench press 500 lbs, after Doug Hepburn. As an actor, Park made five films‚Äîall Italian Hercules sword and sandal pictures. Laura Efrikian and Reg Park in Hercules Conquers Atlantis Up to the time of his illness in 2007, despite being in his seventies, Park continued to train clients at the Morningside Virgin Active Gym in Sandton, South Africa. He has been featured in many fitness and bodybuilding magazines, and has also appeared on the cover of Muscle & Fitness. He was inducted into the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB) IFBB Hall of Fame's first ballot in 1999. Death and legacy With his wife of 55 years, Mareon, and children Jeunesse and Jon Jon by his side, Park died on 22 November 2007 in his home in South Africa, after an eight-month battle with metastatic melanoma (a form of skin cancer). Park's legacy is continued by his son Jon Jon Park, a personal trainer and former Olympic swimmer. Reg Park raised and trained Jon Jon in South Africa. Today Jon Jon Park is the owner of the Legacy Gym, a popular gymnasium in West Los Angeles. Reg's daughter, Jeunesse, founded Food & Trees for Africa, a non profit that changed thousands of lives and landscapes. Famous for his mass and strength, Reg Park was an early influence and lifelong mentor to champion bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger said that he was inspired to become a bodybuilder after seeing Park. For three years in the 1960s Schwarzenegger was trained by Wag Bennett in his gym in the East End of London, and it was there where he met his idol Reg Park. Bonus footage from the DVD release of the classic documentary film Pumping Iron (1977) features Park mentoring Schwarzenegger. Park can also be heard performing the Master of Ceremonies duties in the Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia contests featured in the film proper.

Through his columns in Scientific American, including \\"The Amateur Scientist\\", and his three-volume series Amateur Telescope Making, Ingalls exerted a great influence on amateur astronomy and amateur telescope making in the United States. Biography Ingalls was born in Elmira, New York, an only child. In 1914 he graduated from Cornell University. He worked odd jobs, including telegraph operator, until enlisting in the New York National Guard and serving in France during World War I. In 1923 he became an editor at Scientific American, an affiliation he maintained until his retirement in 1955. He later described his editorial duties as \\"obtaining articles, editing articles, finding the illustrations, writing the captions, reading the proof and, in general, being wet-nurse to six major articles each month.\\" He started a regular column, \\"The Back Yard Astronomer\\" in 1928 which he later named \\"The Amateur Scientist\\". His final column appeared in April 1955 shortly before his retirement. Ingalls's primary interests were in the areas of astronomy and telescope construction. After reading an article by Russell W. Porter on telescope making, he arranged a visit by Porter to New York in June 1925, out of which came an article later that year in Scientific American. The article was so well received that Ingalls began a series of columns on amateur telescope making, some written in collaboration with Porter. Ingalls and Porter became close friends and the two men remained at the center of the American amateur telescope making community for the next thirty years. A number of articles from the columns, together with illustrations by Porter, were published in book form as Amateur Telescope Making, the first volume of which appeared in 1926, followed by volumes 2 and 3 in 1937 and 1953. These books helped to create lasting public interest in observational astronomy.Willard, B., \\"A Brief History of Stellafane\\" The books have come to be called \\"the bible of telescope making\\". During World War II, Ingalls organized the work of amateur telescope makers to help overcome the shortage of roof prisms for military instruments. After his retirement in 1955, Ingalls travelled about New York state studying genealogy until he was struck by a car. His injuries left him paralyzed, and he died a year later at the age of 70.

It covers over in the form of a Site of Special Scientific Interest. History The Warren Lodge, built by the priory Thetford Forest was created after the First World War to provide a strategic reserve of timber, since the country had lost so many oaks and other slow-growing trees as a consequence of the war's demands. It is managed by the Forestry Commission. The creation of the forest destroyed much of the typical Breckland environment of gorse and sandy ridges, ending the frequent sand blows (where the wind picked up sand and blew it across the land reducing visibility). However, this environment was itself man-made, since the area had been denuded by flint-mining, the construction of rabbit warrens and other activities. Grimes Graves is located within the forest. =Making a landscape= Acquiring the land By the end of the First World War the economic position of the large landed estates in England were bleak and particularly acute in areas of poor soil like Breckland. Farms were left untenanted and land became derelict. At this time the Forestry Commission had been established. In 1922, the first purchases of land were made with over 80% of the land in Thetford Forest acquired in the 1920s and 1930s in the form of large blocks of land from the former estates. Management Since the forest's inception decisions affecting the forest have been taken locally at the Divisional Offices at Santon Downham.Forestry Commission - Santon Downham Retrieved 23 August 2013 At a local level, authority rested with the Divisional or District Officers. Many of these officers were recruited from affluent, land owning families who were attracted into forestry at the time when much of agriculture was in a depressed state. Foresters were the next level in the hierarchy and were often recruited from the forestry workers and by the 1940s they were trained for two years in the Commission's Forestry Schools. Beneath them were the gangers or foremen who supervised the forestry workers. The forest workers were organised into gangs of between three and thirty, their tasks included clearing ground, planting, weeding and later brashing and thinning. Labour and labour camps Breckland of the 1920s was an area of high unemployment and the Commission had few problems recruiting staff. From the outset the Commission believed that it would help alleviate unemployment in rural Britain. Many people were keen to take up forestry work, especially as the job included a tied cottage, many with an attached small holding. By the late 1920s, unemployed people, mainly miners, from the depressed areas of the North of England were housed in the forest holdings. As the depression deepened training camps were established. From 1928 up to 1938, 21 camps and a further 10 only used in the summer months housing a total of 6000 men were scattered throughout the infant forest. The unemployment schemes and mass unemployment came to an end with the onset of World War II. The war years saw a drastic shortage of labour as local men joined the armed forces or took up other jobs. This led to a significant number of women employed in the forest. They were employed by the Timber Production Department, and by 1943 the Women's Land Army had a training camp at Wordwell on the edge of the forest. With the end of the war women workers gradually decreased. In 1946, the Forest Workers Training Scheme was set up providing one year's training for demobbed servicemen. During the post-war years the number of people employed increased to 570 by 1950. However, with the development of the nearby town of Thetford recruitment of labour became more difficult. With the introduction of modern technology and the use of modern weedkillers these problems eased through the sixties and by the mid-1970s the numbers of workers was similar to the 1930s. =Planting= Seed collection The vast quantities of trees needed for the forest in its infancy needed huge amounts of seed much of it obtained locally. Men and women were sent out into the countryside, gathering cones from existing plantations and pine hedges. As the new plantations matured it was possible to obtain seed from the forest itself. From 1925 the seed was extracted from the cones at the Seed Extraction Unit at Santon Downham, this continued to be operated until 1964. Once the seed had germinated the seedlings were transplanted after one year's growth. This was later increased to two years. After being lined out in the nursery they were grown on for one to two years before they were planted in the forest. Tree species As soon as a property was acquired by the Commission planting began with the majority of the forest planted within the first 20 years. The scots pine was the initial choice as the main forest tree given the adverse local conditions and seeds being readily available in the locality. However, the corsican pine was being established at several locations from the early 1920s. Today (2013), the tree is the dominant species in the forest owing to its having greater resistance to fungal diseases and insect pests, more tolerance of the thin chalky soils and producing a higher volume of timber per acre. Many other species of conifer were planted including the Douglas fir and larch but these were less tolerant of local conditions than the pines. Substantial numbers of indigenous hardwood trees were planted in the 1920s and 1930s. Oak and beech plantings were vulnerable to spring frosts and deer proved a threat particularly to the beech saplings. Oak tended to fare better but they grew slowly compared to pines, and were considered uneconomic with numbers being planted steadily declining. However, hardwood trees have been planted to form narrow roadside belts acting as a fire control measure. Besides oak and beech a wide variety of species including lime, walnut, red oak and maple have been established. =The forest matures= Maintenance and industry As the trees became established and were approximately 20 feet high all side shoots up to six feet were removed. This process called brashing ensured easy access, less risk of fire and the first six feet of the tree had a reduced knotty core. The next stage after brashing was pre-thinning this process was carried out after 15 to 16 years. It involved the removal of diseased trees. Larger trees known as wolves were also removed as they suppressed their smaller and straighter more valuable neighbours. Thinning began when the trees were 18 to 20 years old, coinciding with the start of World War 2. At this time there was much debate about how the work would be carried out. It was decided that racks or access ways 18 to 20 feet in width would be cut and then dividing the compartments into blocks covering 5 acres. Next, two rows of trees were removed to create a rack some 10 feet wide. The thinnings were graded and the straighter poles used as pit props in the coal industry. Other thinnings had a wide range of uses including fencing posts, pea poles in gardens and into netting stakes for the local rabbit warrens. Curved or irregular shaped cuttings was sold as firewood. In 1946, a central processing depot was established at Brandon to process poles into pit-props destined for the East Midlands coalfields. Large amounts of waste material was generated and this attracted a secondary industry of charcoal burning. As the forest matured the quantity of the thinnings increased with the disposal of them continued to be a problem. By 1950, demand from the National Coal Board for the timber decreased and the commission had to find new outlets, these included many of the smaller poles being cut up and converted into wallboard and some 60 tons of pine transported each week to a wood wool factory in Manchester. Large numbers of thinnings were taken to the Commission's own creosote plant at Santon Downham which was established in 1958 before closing in 1970. As the forest matured the size of the material being removed increased and clear felling of mature areas began with felled timber being sold directly to timber merchants. By the mid 1960s chainsaws had been introduced and by the early 1980s specially adapted tractors and trailers known as forwarders came into widespread operation. With the arrival of the harvester in 1991 full mechanization had reached the forest. Some 2500 trees were being extracted each day producing 180,000 cubic metres of timber annually by 1997. Much of this is sold to local saw mills and used in the building industry with the remainder producing fence posts, pallets and pit props. Conservation Visitor numbers have been increasing steadily from the 1950s as the forest matured and now exceed 1 million annually. Open areas created by felling have made the forest a more pleasant place for visitors to walk and picnic. These changes have now attracted a wider variety of wildlife including birds such as crossbills and nesting sparrowhawks which have increased interest from naturalists. The commissions changing attitude to the public was in part a response to the threat of privatisation in the 1980s. In 1985 the Thetford Forest Management Plan were recommending a wide range of measures including the importance of wildlife and the forest to be visually pleasing and culminated in May 1990 with forest designated as a Forest Park. The growing importance of recreation was reflected with the opening of the High Lodge visitor centre in 1992. Conservation in the management of the forest has greatly increased and by 1991 a Conservation Panel made up of experts in various relevant fields had been set up. Within the forest English Nature have designated 11 SSSIs which have been chosen as representative of the principal Breckland habitats. Biodiversity Southern fringe of Thetford Forest The forest is largely surrounded by farmland, as well as the villages of West Stow, Ingham, Elveden, and the towns of Mundford and Thetford in Norfolk, and Brandon in Suffolk, however it has a high level of biodiversity. It is home to a large population of hares, rabbits and gamebirds. Several species of deer also reside there, muntjac, roe deer and a small population of red deer, the last hunted by the Norwich Staghounds before deer hunting was outlawed.page 4 Norwich Staghounds Retrieved 18 June 2013 The forest is well known for its scarce breeding birds, such as woodlarks, nightjars, goshawks, crossbills, siskins as well as an introduced population of golden pheasants.

It ranges from accurate historical reproductions of pioneer, mountain man, Civil War, cowboy and vaquero clothing to the stylized garments popularized by singing cowboys such as Gene Autry and Roy Rogers in the 1940s and 1950s. Western wear can be very informal, with a t-shirt and blue jeans forming a basic ensemble, or it may consist of tailored formal garments with western accents. At minimum, western wear generally incorporates a cowboy hat, a leather belt, and cowboy boots. Hat Lawman Bat Masterson wearing a bowler hat. In the early days of the Old West, it was the bowler hat rather than the slouch hat, centercrease (derived from the army regulation Hardee hat), or sombrero that was the most popular among cowboys as it was less likely to blow out off in the wind. By the 1870s, however, the Stetson had become the most popular cowboy hat due to its use by the Union Cavalry as an alternative to the regulation blue kepi.Stetson Hats 1865‚Äì1870, Jeffery B. Snyder 1997* CavHooah.com ‚Äì Stetson Page Stampede strings were installed to prevent the hat from being blown off when riding at speed. These long strings were usually made from leather or horsehair. Typically, the string was run half-way around the crown of a cowboy hat, and then through a hole on each side with its ends knotted and then secured under the chin or around the back of the head keeping the hat in place in windy conditions or when riding a horse. The tall white ten gallon hats traditionally worn by movie cowboys were of little use for the historical gunslinger as they made him an easy target, hence the preference of lawmen like Wild Bill Hickok, Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson for low-crowned black hats.Wild Bill Hickok collection at Nebraska State Historical Society Originally part of the traditional Plains Indian clothing, coonskin caps were frequently worn by mountain men like Davy Crockett for their warmth and durability.

A Western dress shirt is often elaborately decorated with piping, embroidered roses and a contrasting yoke. In the 1950s these were frequently worn by movie cowboys like Roy Rogers or Clayton Moore's Lone Ranger.Western Shirts Derived from the elaborate Mexican vaquero costumes like the guayabera and the battleshirts worn by many Confederate soldiers, these were worn at rodeos so the cowboy could be easily identifiable.Guayabera Buffalo Bill was known to wear them with a buckskin fringe jacket during his Wild West shows and they were fashionable for teenagers in the 1970s and late 2000s.The Western shirt Another common type of Western shirt is the shield- front shirt worn by many US Cavalry troopers during the American Civil War but originally derived from a red shirt issued to prewar firefighters. The cavalry shirt was made of blue wool with yellow piping and brass buttons and was invented by the flamboyant George Armstrong Custer.Shield front shirts In recent times this shield-front shirt was popularised by John Wayne in Fort Apache and was also worn by rockabilly musicians like the Stray Cats.

In the preface to the score, she states that split tones \\"tend to be unstable and prone to distortion,\\" and, \\"it is expected that a degree of fluctuation or 'fraying' will occur in most split tones and this should be regarded as part of the overall timbral quality of the trumpet part.\\"Lim, Liza. Ehwaz. Ricordi, 2010. p. I. Method In a blog post for his Cologne-based ensemble musikFabrik, American trombonist Bruce Collings provided a basic method for producing split tones: Treatment When split tones occur unintentionally, they are referred to as double buzzing. This phenomenon is widely understood to occur due to fatigue.Lewis, Eddie. \\"Double Buzz\\", EddieLewis.com. Accessed: November 7, 2011. David Hickman writes \\"In most cases, double buzzes occur because of sore or bruised lips. This causes the player to tilt the mouthpiece unconsciously at an abnormal angle to relieve pressure on the sore area. In these cases rest over several days is the best remedy.\\"David R. Hickman, Trumpet Pedagogy: A Compendium of Modern Teaching Techniques (Chandler, Arizona: Hickman Music Editions, 2006), 221. A double buzz results from an uneven balance of pressure between the upper and lower lips. Tilting the horn either up or down will balance the pressure. Others suggest focusing on producing a clear tone on the mouthpiece only. It can be helpful to experiment with the double buzz and learn to produce it on demand. Learning to control it may help in learning to \\"turn it off\\" during regular playing.Phil Schaefer, interview 2005. A completely different approach, favored by pedagogue William Adam and others, is for a student to not pay any attention to the physical aspects of the phenomenon and focus only on producing a clear, focused sound on the instrument.Adam, William, John Harbaugh, and Stewart Aull, A New and Different Way of Getting More Music out of Trumpet (Fairbanks, Alaska: Stewart Aull/Moving Images, 1997) [Videocassette] External links * Bruce Collings, \\"Split Tones (Son Fendu) and Xenakis\\", which includes in-mouthpiece video of trombone split tones, as well as comparisons with other multiphonic techniques. * Stephen Altoft demonstrates trumpet split tones. * Matt Barbier describes a detailed technical method for producing trombone split tones.

He is known primarily for his work in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he was a member of The Naturals alongside his tag team partner Andy Douglas. Professional wrestling career In high school, Chase Stevens was a Golden Gloves boxing champion. After attending a professional wrestling training session, in order to watch a friend, Stevens decided to become a wrestler and joined the training school. After several weeks, veteran wrestler Tracy Smothers took him under his wing and became his trainer and mentor. Stevens debuted in 1998 under a mask as \\"Glacius\\", losing to fellow trainee Johnny B. Dazzled. Stevens found a niche as a tag team specialist, teaming with Blaze as \\"High Velocity\\" and Cassidy O'Reilly as \\"The Hotshots\\". The latter team appeared with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in July 2002, and were given full-time contracts. The team split when Reilly left TNA due to travel problems, and Stevens was sent to USA Championship Wrestling for seasoning. In USA Championship Wrestling Stevens was placed in a tag team with Andy Douglas by Bob Ryder. While on a fishing trip they chose the name \\"Natural Heat\\", which was later shortened to \\"The Naturals\\". The Naturals became a pair of sneaky, cheating villains. The Naturals began working for Jerry Lawler's Memphis Wrestling promotion in 2003, where they were renamed \\"The Alternative Express\\". The Alternative Express - a gothic pair of rock fans who wore black clothing and recolored their hair and fingernails - were managed by The Goddess Athena. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003‚Äì2007)= The Naturals (2003‚Äì2006) The Naturals were brought into TNA in late 2003, immediately beginning a lengthy feud with America's Most Wanted. In the course of the feud, they defeated America's Most Wanted for the NWA World Tag Team Championship on July 7, 2004. The Naturals successfully defended their titles against Triple X, but were eventually beaten by Chris Harris and Elix Skipper (one member of each team) on September 8, 2004. In 2005, The Naturals formed an alliance with Chris Candido, who also became their manager. On April 26, they defeated America's Most Wanted to become NWA World Tag Team Champions for a second time. The sudden death of Candido two days later led to a surge in popularity for The Naturals, eventually turning them into fan favorites. On June 19, 2005 at Slammiversary, The Naturals were assisted in a title defence against Team Canada by Jimmy Hart. They were managed by Hart throughout mid-2005, with their reign ending on the October 22 episode of TNA Impact!. Then they lost to America's Most Wanted following interference from Jeff Jarrett and Gail Kim. They were defeated by AMW in their rematch at Bound for Glory on October 23, again following interference from Kim. During the October 25 Impact! tapings, Stevens injured his neck after landing badly during a match. He was diagnosed as having suffered an avulsion fracture of his C5 and C6 vertebrae, in addition to herniating his C4 vertebra (described by TNA as the \\"mildest form of trauma associated with a broken neck\\"). The injury did not require surgery, and Stevens returned for Genesis on November 13, teaming with Douglas and Lance Hoyt in a loss to the Diamonds in the Rough. In April 2006, Stevens began a bit of singles work in light of his partner being injured by Scott Steiner. Stevens' singles run did not go overly well, as he was unable to post a victory in any of his competitions, losing to Samoa Joe twice, Abyss once, and losing an Xscape match at Lockdown 2006. In June 2006, Stevens and Douglas began to be managed by the returning Shane Douglas after he approached them, asking to be their manager. The duo accepted his offer and were shown \\"training\\" in several vignettes which aired on Impact!. Newly Franchised (2006‚Äì2007) At Victory Road, The Naturals returned in brand new black and yellow attire (to replace their black and pink attire) and were managed by Shane Douglas. They were called 'The Newly Franchised Naturals', in reference to Shane's nickname 'The Franchise', and beat The Diamonds In The Rough. On the August 17 edition of Impact!, Stevens defeated Chris Harris, Frankie Kazarian and B.G. James to win a tag team championship shot for him and Andy. Shane took their tag title match away from them after they lost a match on Impact! to teach them a lesson. They then won a Tag Team \\"Triple Chance\\" Battle Royal the following month at No Surrender. This suggested that their push that had been going for several months would finally conclude with them getting a tag title shot at Bound for Glory, but they ended up losing a Four Corners match on the undercard of the show, not even getting the title shot. The Naturals then began a feud with Team 3D and defeated them in a Tables match on TNA's primetime debut. Then it started speculation that the storyline would once again get better for The Naturals, but then on the December 21 episode of Impact!, Shane turned his back on The Naturals after they lost the second Tables match to Team 3D, saying \\"This experiment is over\\". Stevens wrestled Lance Hoyt at Final Resolution on January 14, 2007. He lost the match, which led to Shane coming out asking why he was wearing the Franchised gear, when he said the experiment was over. This led to Stevens shoving him, with security separating the two. On May 10 both Stevens and Douglas were released from their contracts. =World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (2007‚Äì2008, 2012)= Stevens alongside his Naturals partner, Andy Douglas, were originally going to receive a try-out match for World Wrestling Entertainment at a Raw taping in September 2007, but was cancelled when Douglas posted the tryout information on his Myspace without WWE's permission. Stevens later appeared on the March 21, 2008 edition of WWE SmackDown, alongside his Naturals partner Andy Douglas, fighting in a losing effort to the Big Show. He made another appearance on the September 16, 2008 edition of ECW, losing to Jack Swagger and again the next week against Mike Knox. Stevens was in attendance for a tryout at the March 12, 2012 WWE RAW SuperShow in Cleveland. The next day, on March 13, 2012, Stevens wrote on his Twitter page that he was backstage in Columbus for the SmackDown tapings, saying he was as ready as he will ever be. =Independent circuit (2007‚Äìpresent)= Stevens at an independent show, 2012 Stevens returned to wrestle on the southeast independent circuit with Naturals partner Andy Douglas. He has wrestled in many organizations such as Showtime All-Star Wrestling, United States Wrestling Organization, United Wrestling Association and The Jerry Lawler Tribute Show where he and Andy Douglas defeated Big Bully Douglas and Seven. In late 2008 Andy Douglas turned on Stevens while Stevens teamed with Arrick Andrews and Nikki Vaughn in a tag team match against the A-Team thus Douglas aligned himself with The A-Team joining TNA Alumni, David Young and Rick Santel. This created a bitter rivalry between the two spanning over a year long and culminating in several matches, until Andy's retirement in early 2010. Chase Stevens is a former SAW International Heavyweight Champion, a championship he won from Kid Kash on the same night Andy Douglas and himself, had their final war. He lost the title to Phill Shatter. On September 28, 2012, Stevens defeated Matt Hardy in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee at KFW Black Harvest 2012. On October 20, 2012, Stevens defeated John Skyler, Jon Malus and Sixx at WrestleForce Fall Brawl 3: All Or Nothing to win the WrestleForce Championship. On November 3, 2012, at Crossfire Wrestling's TV Taping The Hot Shots (Cassidy Riley and Chase Stevens) defeated Diamonds in the Rough (David Young and Sigmon) in Nashville, Tennessee. On May 17, 2013, at WrestleForce Revenge Stevens teamed with TNA Superstars Crimson, D.O.C and Gunner defeating Team WrestleForce Brady Pierce, Cedric Alexander, John Skyler and Jon Malus. On May 30, 2014, Stevens participated in a match for the UCW (Universal Championship Wrestling) Heavyweight title in a street fight, but lost the match. He faced Rhyno after \\"The Headliner\\" Chris Michaels was a no-show. On June 14, 2013, Stevens challenged Rob Conway for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the NWA SAW Gathering of the Champions event, the match ended in a draw after time had expired. In 2014, Chase Stevens participated in a Triple Threat Match in Puerto Rico for the Entertainment Wrestling Organization's (EWO) World Championship against Dameon Slugga and Mike Piconose, during EWO's \\"Renacer\\" (Reborn) event, where Stevens successfully captured the championship. On May 11, 2015, Stevens was announced as part of the roster for the Global Force Wrestling (GFW) promotion. =Return to TNA (2013)= Stevens returned to TNA on March 17, 2013 as he took part in 10 man Battle Royal which featured TNA Wrestlers from the past and present, the match was won by Matt Morgan. On March 18, 2013, The Hot Shots (Cassidy Riley and Chase Stevens) were defeated by the Aces & Eights (Wes Brisco and Garett Bischoff) in the first round of the TNA Tag Team Tournament.

The film chronicles the lives of several gay men and one lesbian who were persecuted by the Nazis. The gay men were arrested by the Nazis for the crime of homosexuality under Paragraph 175, the sodomy provision of the German penal code, dating back to 1871. Between 1933 and 1945, 100,000 men were arrested under Paragraph 175. Some were imprisoned, others were sent to concentration camps. Only about 4,000 survived.

He was born at Saint-C√©neri-pr√®s-S√©es (now Aunou-sur-Orne) in Normandy, and distinguished himself for his mechanical genius which was of great avail to the French army in Egypt. Napoleon called him ‚Äúa universal man with taste, understanding and genius capable of creating the arts of France in the middle of the Arabian Desert.‚Äù Aeronautics One of his early interests while still at S√©es was in the newly developing science of aeronautics. He made at least one hot air balloon which he flew in the public square. He contributed to the improvement of the production of hydrogen gas, as well as the treatment of the gas bag of the balloon itself. In Egypt Cont√© was called on to exercise his expertise in ballooning and was asked to prepare an ascent for the celebration of the French New Year on 22 September 1798. He was not sufficiently prepared so the event was postponed to 1 December. On that occasion his efforts met with a near disaster. The balloon caught fire and the Egyptians received the impression that what had been demonstrated was a machine of war for setting fire to the enemy encampments. At a second attempt with a larger balloon, it is said that the ascent was witnessed in Esbekia Square by 100,000. It is probable that the use of the balloon in Egypt was limited to impressing the local population and was never found suitable for military purposes. Al- Jabarti, (‚ÄòAbd al-Rahman al-Jabarti al-Misri) in his account of the ascent said ‚ÄúTheir claim that this apparatus is like a vessel in which people sit and travel to other countries in order to discover news and other falsifications did not appear to be true.‚Äù Writing and drawing equipment Cont√© invented the modern pencil lead at the request of Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot. The French Republic was at that time under economic blockade and unable to import graphite from Great Britain, the main source of the material. Carnot asked Cont√© to create a pencil that did not rely on foreign imports. After several days of research, Cont√© had the idea of mixing powdered graphite with clay and pressing the material between two half-cylinders of wood. Thus was formed the modern pencil. Cont√© received a patent for the invention in 1795, and formed la Soci√©t√© Cont√© to make them. He also invented the cont√© crayon named after him, a hard pastel stick used by artists. At the 1798 Exposition des produits de l'industrie fran√ßaise Cont√© won an honorable distinction, the highest award, for his \\"crayons of various colours\\".

Created in 1980 by members of the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus, they were described by The Advocate as \\"a non-official offshoot\\" of SFGMC along with three official subgroups.Guthman, Edward: \\"Merry Musicmakers from Coast to Coast\\". The Advocate, March 5, 1981 Automatic Pilot soon came into their own as an independent force, creating a niche at the fringe of the nascent gay musical movement and a new musical style. They achieved notoriety early on with songs such as \\"Sit On My Face\\" and \\"Killer Purses\\" performed at benefits for the SFGMC, Theatre Rhinoceros, and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. They derived their name from psychiatric testimonySan Francisco Chronicle, May 10, 1979 at Dan White's trial for killing Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. History The ensemble consisted of up to four part vocals led by Matthew McQueen, backed by pianist Karl Brown, with violin, flute/sax, and a string bassist and drummer from the San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band. With an acoustic parody of punk rock as a starting point, writers Brown and McQueen incorporated elements of jazz, classical, theater and the avant-garde into somewhat twisted song structures that are both interesting and accessible. Their sound, dubbed \\"erotic jazz wave\\" has been compared to cartoon music, klezmer, and Frank Zappa. Automatic Pilot anticipated the queercore bands by a decade. The post-punk genre fits best due to the time period, punk influence and experimental bent. Automatic Pilot continued to perform in San Francisco at various venues including the Castro Street Fair, the On Broadway Theater and the Valencia Rose gay performance space, venturing as far as the Chute II Bar in Reno.

Viking Age Iceland. Penguin Books Ltd; London, 2009. Page 99. It was written by an anonymous writer, who describes a long-standing feud between Snorri Go√∞i and Arnkel Go√∞i, two strong chieftains within the Norse community that settled in Iceland. The title is slightly misleading as it deals also with the clans from √û√≥rsnes and Alptafj√∂r√∞r on Iceland. The most central character is Snorri √ûorgr√≠msson, referred to as Snorri Go√∞i and Snorri the Priest. Snorri was the nephew of the hero of G√≠sla saga, and is also featured prominently in Nj√°ls saga and Laxd≈ìla saga. Another main interest of the Eyrbyggja Saga is to trace a few key families as they settled Iceland, specifically around the Sn√¶fellsnes peninsula. The Saga is usually not regarded as artistically equal to Egil's saga, Nj√°ls saga and Laxd√¶la saga. Nevertheless, it is valued for many reasons, including its historical and folkloric elements. The saga is characterized by a distinct interest in old lore, rituals, pagan practices and superstitions. The saga includes several references to the colonization of Greenland and one reference to an expedition to Vinland. It also mentions a journey by Gu√∞leifr Gu√∞laugsson and his crew to Great Ireland, which was said to exist beyond Vinland. Sections of the Eyrbyggja Saga have survived in fragments from the 13th century and in numerous manuscripts from the 14th century.Byock, Jesse. Viking Age Iceland. Penguin Books Ltd; London, 2009. Page 99, 100, 104.http://www.northvegr.org/sagas%20annd%20epics/icelandic%20family%20sagas/eyrbyggja%20saga/001.html Synopsis Modern day map of Sn√¶fellsnes The Saga portrays the different families and individuals living on Iceland at Sn√¶fellsnes. There is constant fighting between the different clans on Sn√¶fellsnes, mostly over resources such as wood, property, and livestock. The different Norsemen represented in the Saga constantly turn to Snorri and Arnkel for advice and permission to take legal and/or physical action against perpetrators that have wronged them. The story of the Eyrbyggja Saga frequently turns on actions that stem from greed, fear, ambition or downright meanness, as it describes cold-hearted bargaining between farmers and chieftains. All of the events of the Saga take place in one small region of Sn√¶fellsnes, shifting between √Ålptafjord, which cuts into the northern shore of the peninsula, and Helgafell, the farmstead on Th√≥rsnes, where Snorri Go√∞i resided.Byock, Jesse. Viking Age Iceland. Penguin Books Ltd; London, 2009. Page 100. The Saga shows a steady shift from paganism on Iceland to Christianity over the course of roughly twenty years. Modern day Helgafell The saga was most likely written in its entirety in the mid- or late-13th century, but historians have not yet been able to pinpoint an exact date. The narrative begins at the time of the Norse settlement in Iceland as early as the 9th century, but most of the events take place towards the end of the 10th century and the early 11th century. There is also internal evidence that the author of the saga knew of Laxd≈ìla saga and Egils saga. The Saga cannot be taken too literally, since it is a story and not a written history. Many of the places, events, and people are quite real, but the some of situations are questionable. The author tends to favor Snorri Go√∞i over any other character in the Saga. This is probably because the author was a Christian scholar and wished to praise Snorri for popularizing Christianity and declaring it the official religion on Iceland. Overview Sn√¶fellsnes is a peninsula in western Iceland. *Government Eyrbyggja Saga shows the Norse system of legalities on Sn√¶fellsnes which used a trial by jury system. There was normally a local chieftain who oversaw property boundaries, settled disputes between landlords and blood feuds, and prosecuted criminals. Snorri Go√∞i, in particular, was the head chieftain on Sn√¶fellsnes and dealt with local disputes over firewood, blood feuds, and property distribution. Snorri is also seen putting ghosts on trial for their hauntings. Chapter 55 of the Saga shows Snorri and his nephew Kiartan summoning Thorir Wooden-leg and other ghosts with coming and going about Frodis-water without permission and despoiling men of their lives and good fortune. These trials brought an end to the hauntings that occurred at Frodis-water. *Women Women represented in the Saga are prominent and strong-willed characters. They could own property, become merchants, court their own marriages, and command legions of sailors. For example, Geirrid, the sister of Geirrod of Ere, had workers build her a large vestibule hallway in which she could examine all the men that passed by in attempts to find a future husband.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 9 *Death ritual The Saga shows that, upon death, a hole was cut in the wall closest to where the corpse was and the body was removed from the house through the hole. It was believed that, if a dead person was carried through the front door, their ghost would remember how to enter and exit the house and come back to haunt the house.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 33 *Religion The Saga shows a strong shift from Paganism to Christianity.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 50 The author explains that Snorri Go√∞i permitted the construction of Christian churches around Sn√¶fellsnes, which was the same summer that Snorri declared Christianity was the official religion of Iceland, although it is unclear how many Norsemen actually converted from Norse paganism to Christianity. Archaeological evidence suggests that Pagan and Christian burials took place on Iceland, specifically on Sn√¶fellsnes.Jesse Byock, et all. A Viking Age Valley in Iceland: The Mosfell Archaeological Project. Maney Publishing, 1995. Page 200, 201, 205. Many Icelandic Norsemen were baptized and called themselves Christians, but little of their old Pagan rituals and beliefs had been abandoned; for example, cremating a corpse and drinking heavily after a funeral were pagan rituals.Joynes, Andrew. Medieval Ghost Stories, an Anthology of Miracles, Marvels and Progress. Boydell Press; Rochester, New York, 2001. Page 112. Prominent characters An illustrated recreation of Snorri Go√∞i, by Andreas Bloch in 1898, titled Aasgrim follows Snorri Go√∞i to his booth, an event that was featured in the Nj√°ls saga =Snorri Go√∞i= Snorri acted as the chieftain of Sn√¶fellsnes, and the author constantly depicts him as the wise, classical hero. The Saga's main area of focus is featured around his life. Snorri also converted to Christianity and declared Christianity the official religion of Iceland. He permitted the construction of Christian churches around Sn√¶fellsnes. ::Snorri was middling in height and somewhat slender, fair to look on, straight faced and of light hue; of yellow hair and red beard; he was meek of mood in his daily ways; little men knew of his thought for good or ill; he was a wise man, and forseeing in many things, enduring in wrath and deep in hatred; of good rede was he for his friends, but his unfriends deemed his counsels but cold.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 15 In chapter 37, Snorri and his foster brothers kill Arnkel whilst he is working on his farm. In the ensuing court case regarding the murder of Arnkel, only Thorleif Thorbrandsson (√ûorbrandsson) was convicted and outlawed.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 37, 38 Snorri, after killing Arnkel, later sided with his foster brothers, the Thorbrandssons (√ûorbrandssons), in their feud with the Thorlaksson family. He took part in the battle of Alftafjord with his foster brothers and rescued them after they were all wounded at the battle of Vigrafjord.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 46 A compromise was later reached between the two families, after Snorri courted his daughter with the son of Thormod Thorlaksson.Eyrbyggja Saga chapters 44-46 Snorri also made an attempt to kill Bjorn Asbrandsson, who had an affair with his sister Thurid while she was married to Thorodd the Tribute Trader, a marriage that Snorri helped to arrange. Bjorn fended off Snorri's attack, but was later convinced to leave Iceland.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 47 Snorri in his later years successfully led a fight against Ospak Kjallaksson, a Norseman who had assembled a group of men that constantly attacked and pillaged his neighbors. Snorri and his gang killed Ospak and the other members of his group. Snorri spared Ospak's son and allowed him inherit his father's farm.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 62 Snorri had several children and was able to create marriage alliances with many leading families in Iceland. Snorri's descendants included the Sturlungs, through his son Halldor.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 65 =Arnkel= Arnkel, like Snorri, acted as chieftain over the peoples of Holyfell, and was also referred to as Arnkel the Priest. He is often depicted as the enemy of Snorri by the author. Arnkel provides similar information to the Norse living on Iceland on such matters as property rights and blood feuds. Arnkel became involved in further disputes with Snorri after Arnkel's father, Thorolf Halt-foot, accused Snorri of stealing his firewood. As the Saga progresses, Arnkel claims properties around Sn√¶fellsnes, in which he also claims land from peoples who he presided over.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 31Byock, Jesse. Viking Age Iceland. Penguin Books Ltd; London, 2009. Page 103, 104. Arnkel finally engages in a physical dispute with Snorri and the Thorbrandssons (√ûorbrandsson), Snorri's foster brothers. Snorri and his foster brothers attack and kill Arnkel whilst he was working on his farm.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 37 ::Arnkel had laid his sword and shield against a hayrick, and now he took up his weapons and defended himself therewith; but now he began to gather wounds, and withal they came up into the garth about him. Then Arnkel leapt up on to the hayrick, and defended himself thence for a space, but such was the end of matter that he fell, and they covered him over there in the garth with hay; and thereafter Snorri and his folk fared home to Holyfell. =Erik the Red= The Saga reveals Erik the Red's discovery of Greenland. He stayed there for three winters, returned to Iceland for a winter, and then returned to settle permanently in Greenland. The saga does not give a specific time of when this took place, but it does suggest that it was fourteen years before Snorri declared Christianity the official religion of Sn√¶fellsnes.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 24 Ghost tales in the Saga Eyrbyggja Saga describes numerous supernatural events that mainly consist of undead animals rising up through the floor and Draugrs coming into the house to warm themselves by the fire. The Draugrs in the Saga have a mixture of characteristics that are \\"typical\\" of Norse ghosts. =Thorolf Halt-Foot= The hills where Thorolf was buried Chapter 31 of Eyrbyggja Saga reveals the death of Thorolf Halt-Foot, who is also the father of Arnkel. Thorolf is reincarnated as a Draugr and a frightening marauder who leaves his tomb to cause devastation around √û√≥rsnes. Thorolf's undead ventures also reveal specific overtones from the Wild Hunt legends. Thorolf's body is buried, reburied, burned, and is reincarnated as a bull, though he continued to cause relentless terror for nearly a year before he finally was permanently laid to rest by Arnkel, who buried his remains on a hillside. Arnkel constructed a high stone wall around Thorolf's grave so that Thorolf could not overcome it. However, Thorolf seemed to continually haunt the hillside where he was buried.Joynes, Andrew. Medieval Ghost Stories, an Anthology of Miracles, Marvels and Progress. Boydell Press; Rochester, New York, 2001. Page 106-108. ::This event took place in the autumn at Hvammr, that [one day] neither the shepherd nor the sheep came home. In the morning a search was made, and the shepherd was found dead not far from √û√≥r√≥lfr¬ís cairn; he was completely coalblack and every bone was broken. He was buried near √û√≥r√≥lfr. Of all the sheep in the valley, some were found dead, and the rest that had strayed into the mountains were never found. Whenever birds landed on √û√≥r√≥lfr¬ís grave, they fell down dead.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 34 Sk√°laholt in the winter =Thorgunna= Chapters 50‚Äì51 of the Saga show a sickly, wealthy seafaring woman named Thorgunna from the south of Iceland who requested at her death bed to be buried in Sk√°laholt, her sheets and bedding to be burned, and her wealth to be donated to the Christian church. Upon Thorgunna's death, Thorodd, a friend, burns all her bedding except her bed sheets, which he gave to his wife as a gift. Thorodd donates her wealth to the church, and transports her body south to Sk√°laholt in a coffin. At nightfall, Thorodd decides to rest on a farmstead just outside Sk√°laholt. In the middle of the night, Thorodd and the farmstead owners awaken to find a dead, naked Thorgunna setting the dinner table and preparing a meal to eat. The farm owner tries to speak to Thorgunna and she disappears after having prepared a full meal. Thorodd along with the other members transporting the corpse and the homesteaders of the farm bless the meat by sprinkling holy water on it, eat the meat without harm, and then sleep peacefully through the night. The next day Thorgunna's corpse is transported to Sk√°laholt and laid to rest, never disturbing Thorodd or his kinsmen again.Eyrbyggja Saga chapters 50, 51Joynes, Andrew. Medieval Ghost Stories, an Anthology of Miracles, Marvels and Progress. Boydell Press; Rochester, New York, 2001. Pages 108-109. =Thorir Wooden-leg and his undead company= Following the death of Thorgunna, the author describes the death of a shepherd at Frodis-water where Thorgunna had once resided. The shepherd haunted the house at Frodis-water until Thorir Wooden-leg fell sick and died after encountering the shepherd's ghost. The shepherd and Thorir haunted Frodis-water, in which four more people fell sick and died one after the other. During the winter just before the Yule Feast, the constant sound of fisherman skinning fish could be heard outside the Frodis-water house. Additionally, a crew of six men were often seen manning a ten-oared boat not far from the shoreline. One night when the Frodis-water inhabitants were gathering for dinner, a seal's head began to emerge from the floor. The people of the house tried to smash the seal back down into the floor boards with sticks and clubs, but the seal kept steadily rising, further out of the floor after each blow. Kiartan, a young man at Frodis-water, ran into the house with a sledge hammer and struck the seal back down into the floorboards.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 53Joynes, Andrew. Medieval Ghost Stories, an Anthology of Miracles, Marvels and Progress. Boydell Press; Rochester, New York, 2001. Page 109-110. Following the incident with the seal at Frodis- water, Thurid and Kiartan invite their neighbors to Frodis-water for the Yule Feast. As Thurid, Kiartan and the guests are dining and sitting about the fire, Thorir and his followers entered the house and shake their dirty clothes all over the house, throwing mud on the guests. The next three nights, Kiartan moves the guests and the fire in to a different room, however Thorir and the other ghosts continue to enter the house, flinging mud and killing servants and farm-hands. Eventually, Snorri, who was also Kiartan's uncle, banishes Thorir and the ghosts from Sn√¶fellsnes using an effective combination of Christian rituals and Icelandic common-laws.Eyrbyggja Saga chapter 54 Popular culture * Robert Louis Stevenson's The Waif Woman: A Cue, from a Saga (1914) was based on this saga.

(; , ) (born in Armenia, died in Maastricht, traditionally on 13 May 384) was bishop of Tongeren Latin: Atuatuca Tungrorum, the capital of the Tungri. Servatius is patron saint of the city of Maastricht and the towns of Schijndel and Grimbergen. He is one of the Ice Saints. His feast day is May 13. History Basilica of St Servatius in Maastricht A widely travelled diplomat and a determined prosecutor of Arianism, the presence of Servatius is recorded at several synods and church councils. In 343, Sarbatios - Greek texts rendering v as b - was present at the Council of Sardica (modern Sofia). In the debates, Servatius represented the Trinitarian view, which clashed with the Arian view of most Eastern bishops. When Athanasius, leader of the anti-Arian party, was in exile in Trier, he may have met with Servatius in Trier or Tongeren, because both men campaigned against Arian bishops and priests in the region. In 346, at the Council of Cologne,Fourthcentury.com Servatius testified against the bishop of Cologne, saying that \\"he denied the divinity of Jesus Christ, this even happened in the presence of Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria\\", adding to this \\"our churches are adjacent\\". After co-emperor Constans had been assassinated in 350, Servatius was sent to the Roman emperor Constantius II in Edessa, the capital of Armenian Mesopotamia, as an envoy of the usurper Magnentius to represent the late Constans as an unworthy tyrant and oppressor, in the hope of obtaining Constantius' recognition of Magnentius as co-ruler. The mission failed and the resulting civil war ended with the death of Magnentius in 353. The mission can be seen as a sign of the high standing of Servatius. In 359, at the Council of Rimini, Sulpicius Severus reports that Servatius again eloquently denounced Arianism. An important source about the life of Saint Servatius, albeit not a contemporary source, is Gregory of Tours' Glory of the Confessors and History of the Franks.Historia Francorum, II.5 In his late 6th- century account, Gregory writes about Aravatius (identified by most scholars as Servatius), who was a bishop of Tongeren and died in Maastricht. According to the Frankish bishop and historian, Aravatius lived at the time when the Huns threatened Tongeren (5th century), which does not match the 4th-century dates of the synods mentioned above. It is not always clear how much of Gregory's account is history and how much is (pious) fiction. Gregory describes how Servatius, during a vigil at Saint Peter's tomb in Rome, had a vision in which the destruction of Tongeren was forecast (because of their sinfulness). Peter then handed the Keys of Heaven to Servatius, transferring to him the power to forgive sins. According to Gregory, Servatius returned to Tongeren, brought the relics of his predecessors to Maastricht, where he died and was buried alongside the Roman road, near the bridge. As a bishop, Servatius may have been the founder of several early Christian churches in the diocese of Tongeren. Two likely candidates are the Basilica of Our Lady in Tongeren and the Basilica of Our Lady in Maastricht. In the case of Tongeren, this traditional claim was supported by excavations in the 1980s, which revealed under the medieval church remains of a 4th-century church, possibly the original cathedral of the diocese. The origins of the Maastricht church of Our Lady remain uncertain, since no excavations have ever been carried out inside this church. In another Maastricht church however, the Basilica of Saint Servatius, excavations in the 1990s have revealed the remains of a 6th- century church (built by bishop Monulph and described by Gregory of Tours as a magnum templum), with at its center a late Roman structure, possibly the tomb of Servatius. Legend The extended family of Saint Servatius, including Jesus, Mary, John the Baptist and Saint Anne (16th-century panel, Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius) Over the centuries legends accumulated around the historical figure of the bishop of Tongeren. Two early vitae (biographies) place Servatius' birth in Armenia and make him a cousin of John the Baptist, and thus a distant relative of Jesus (neither were mentioned by Gregory of Tours). Around 1075, the French priest Jocundus was commissioned by the chapter of Saint Servatius to write another Vita sancti Servatii. Jocundus is also the author of the Miracula sancti Servatii, a sequel to the vita, describing all the miracles that happened after Servatius' death. According to some historians, both works were composed to quell doubts about the genealogy of Servatius and his Armenian descent. These doubts had been raised at the Council of Mainz in 1049. When envoys from the Byzantine emperor arrived at the Council of Mainz, confirming accounts by a certain Alagrecus who had testified that Servatius was Armenian, and asserting that his birthplace was Fenuste, southeast of Damascus, this helped to erase some doubts but Servatius' kinship to Jesus was never confirmed by an official council.P.C. Boeren (see above: Sources) reconstructed Jocundus' Vita sancti Servatii from surviving fragments; his dates are followed. At the end of the 12th century the poet Henric van Veldeke wrote a new legend of Saint Servatius, based on the earlier accounts by Gregory of Tours and Jocundus, to which he added several more miracles, thus emphasizing Saint Servatius' saintliness. The work is considered one of the earliest works of Dutch literature, even though it was written in Limburgish, the most divergent of the 4 major dialects that comprises Middle Dutch. In the 17th century, the Bollandists tried to separate some of the facts and myths surrounding Servatius. They managed to calculate the exact date of his death (13 May 384), which for a long time was accepted as a historical fact.

His tomb has been a place of pilgrimage for many centuries. Famous visitors include Charlemagne, Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor), Philip II of Spain and Pope John Paul II. In Maastricht, the Orthodox Church belonging to the Russian Exarchate of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is also dedicated to Saint Servatius. The Sint Servaasbrug, the oldest bridge over the river Meuse in Maastricht, was named after Saint Servatius. The name 'Servaas' was a popular given name in Maastricht and surroundings for many centuries. The 12th-century gilded reliquary chest in the Basilica of Saint Servatius, containing the saint's relics, is a major work of Mosan art and became known as the 'Chest of Distress' (Dutch: Noodkist) as it was carried around town in times of distress. A pilgrimage with the relics of Saint Servatius and other saints takes place every seven years: the Maastricht Pilgrimage of the Relics (Dutch: Heiligdomsvaart). The Noodkist is normally kept in the Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius, along with the so-called 'Servatiana' (objects that are associated with the saint, such as his pilgrim's staff, his crozier, his pectoral cross, his chalice, his paten and a symbolic key to heaven).

In the Quedlinburg Treasury important relics of Saint Servatius are kept. In many churches around the world, reliquaries, statues, stained glass windows, altar pieces and paintings of Servatius are revered. St. Servatius Church in Kampung Sawah, Indonesia received the relics of Servatius from Maastricht in its establishment date on October 6, 1996. Since then, highly infused by Betawi culture, the festival honoring the relics has been celebrated annually by the parishioners of the church. A mid-15th-century wooden sculpture of Memelia (the ancestor linking Servatius to Jesus) with the infant Servatius in her arms (identifiable by the infant wearing a bishop's mitre) in the Vendsyssel Historiske Museum in Hj√∏rring, Denmark, is iconographically so similar to sculptures of the Madonna and Child, that it was long misattributed.See: 'Den hellige Memelia' on website Vendsyssel Historiske Museum .

Until 1919, it was the parish church of St Peter.  Background  The first church on the site was built in Anglo-Saxon times and fell into ruin during the Norman Invasion in 1066. The Norman Lady of the Manor, Alice de Laci, built a second church that three hundred years later would be destroyed by raiding Scots. During the 14th century the church was rebuilt and some of the older masonry may have been used in the reconstruction of the nave. The nave arcades, the oldest parts of the present building, were completed in 1458. A clerestory above them was added by the end of the 15th century. Chantry chapels were founded, on the north side of the chancel by the Leventhorpe family, and on the south by the owners of Bolling Hall. The tower in the Perpendicular style was added to the west end and finished in 1508. In 1854 Robert Mawer carved a new reredos in Caen stone for the church.Bradford Observer, Thursday 23 August 1855 p5 col.6: \\"The Parish Church\\" There is a photograph of it in the church archive. This reredos was lost during the 1950s rebuild by Edward Maufe. Exterior of Cathedral The clerestory The nave inside the Cathedral Originally in the Diocese of York, the church was in the Diocese of Ripon before becoming a cathedral in 1919, when the Diocese of Bradford was created; it became one of three co-equal cathedrals of the new Diocese of Leeds upon its creation on 20 April 2014. The building was extended in the 1950s and 1960s by Edward Maufe. The east end of the Cathedral (shown in the photo) is Maufe's work, but he reused the Morris & Co. stained glass from the old east window‚Äîthere is therefore Victorian stained glass throughout the building including at the west end a window showing the women of the Bible. The many wall monuments include a sculpture by John Flaxman. Maufe also extended the west of the Cathedral on either side of the tower. In 1987 the nave and west end were re-ordered so as to provide the setting and amenities needed for the increasing number of visitors and the many varied occasions when large numbers of people come to the Cathedral. New entrances were made through the tower walls to the offices and Song Room. The roof panelling was cleaned and restored and new lighting was installed. To enable flexibility of use the Victorian pews were replaced by chairs. The nave organ was removed to give more light and space at the west end, and a Bradford Computer Organ was installed, complementing the pipe organ in the choir with loudspeakers in the nave. The hassocks were embroidered by people from many parishes in the Diocese. They depict Christian symbols and also a woolsack and the White Rose of York. The finest embroidery is seen on the cushions in the Sanctuary and the Choir. At the beginning of the 21st century, the cathedral authorities decided to develop a museum of religion in St Peter's House (built in the 19th century as Bradford's main Post Office). The visitor numbers were much lower than expected and the project collapsed leaving the cathedral in debt, from which it was discharged in 2007. St Peter's House is now owned by a South Asian arts group, Kala Sangam. The cathedral is set in a small conservation area which includes the close to its north. The close provides modern housing for the Dean and Canons Residentiary, the Bishop's official residence, Bishopcroft, being in Heaton, approximately from the city centre. The cathedral and its predecessors were built on the shelf of alluvial land that had formed on the outside of the bend where Bradford Beck turns north, but the town grew up on the lower ground on the other side of the beck, so the church was always just outside the centre of town. In the 19th and 20th centuries the cathedral was partly hidden from the centre by buildings, first by the Post Office just below it, and subsequently by the 1960s developments of Forster Square and Petergate. The latter areas were demolished in 2006, and leaving the cathedral more visible than for many years prior to the completion of the Broadway Centre in 2015.

During term-time, Choral Services are sung as follows: Sunday 10.15 am Choral Eucharist (rotates girls/adults, boys/adults or Cathedral Consort); Sunday 4.00 pm Choral Evensong (rotates boys/adults, girls/adults or Lay Clerks); Monday 5.45 pm Choral Evensong (girls and adults); Tuesday 5.45 pm Choral Evensong (boys and adults); Thursday 5.45 pm Choral Evensong (girls or boys, alternating weekly). The boys and girls of the Choir sing as separate top lines and are drawn from as many as 20 local schools at any time. New entrants spend a couple of terms as a probationer, receiving basic training in singing and musicianship, before progressing to full membership. Full Choristers have the opportunity to take up individual, free-of-charge tuition in singing, musicianship, theory or piano on a 1:1 basis each week. The lay clerks of the Choir are highly skilled volunteers, most of whom make their living outside of music. In September 2015 residential choral scholarships were introduced. The Cathedral Consort, a high standard chamber choir consisting of adult sopranos and lay clerks, completes the Choral Foundation. In addition to the schedule above, the Choir also performs other concerts and services within and outside the diocese. Although foreign tours have been undertaken, the most recent being to Barcelona in 2010 and Bavaria in 2008, touring more recently has been within the UK, with the girls and boys each undertaking a residential tour annually, with or without the choir adults. Tours have been undertaken in recent years to Bristol, Worcester, Edinburgh and Durham. The girls and men are involved with the annual Yorkshire Cathedrals' Girls' Choirs' Festival and hosted the Festal Evensong in March 2015. The boy choristers had not been involved with the Yorkshire Three Choirs Festival since 1981, but with the recent renaissance of an independent boys' top-line at the Cathedral they, along with the lay clerks, were re-included in this annual festival from October 2015. Bradford Cathedral hosted the Festival in October 2016. In July 2012, the Choir recorded two services for the BBC Radio 2 Sunday Half Hour programme, which were broadcast in Autumn 2012, and the girls and men sang live for BBC Radio 4 Sunday Worship in December 2012. The Choir recorded a CD of Evening Canticles, including Humphrey Clucas's 'Bradford Service' in November 2013, and February 2014 saw the Choir recording two programmes of BBC Songs of Praise, airing on 2 March 2014 and Palm Sunday, 13 April 2014. Since 2015, the Choir has performed annually with the European Union Chamber Orchestra, singing Vivaldi's Gloria, Haydn's Little Organ Mass, and Schubert's Mass No. 2 in G major.

The son of William Daniel Ferg and Agnes Ogston, Ferg was educated at Manitoba University and the Manitoba Law School, was called to the Manitoba bar in 1919 and worked as a barrister-at-law. He was a captain in the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps in 1918, and a member of the Royal Canadian Legion. In 1923, he married Helen Fleming Paterson. Ferg was named a King's Counsel in 1949. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1953 provincial election, defeating opponents from the Progressive Conservative Party and Social Credit League in the rural constituency of Cypress. At his nomination speech, Ferg spoke out in favour of the Canadian wheat board and against the liberalization of Manitoba's liquor laws. He served as a backbench supporter of Douglas Campbell's government, and did not run for re-election in 1958. He became mayor of Glenboro in 1959 and died in Winnipeg the following year at the age of 70.

Its population in 2011 was estimated at 823. The river Trev√©lez flows through the village. They are located in the western part of the Alpujarras region. Two of the highest mountains in Spain, Mulhacen and Alcazaba (Sierra Nevada), are just to the north of the village, a few hours' walk away. Located at a height of 1486 metres, Trev√©lez is not the highest recognised municipality in Spain. That honour goes to Valdelinares located in the Sierra de G√∫dar range of the Sistema Ib√©rico, in the province of Teruel, Aragon, Spain. It lies at the confluence of the R√≠o Trev√©lez with a smaller stream, to the southwest of Mulhac√©n, the highest peak of the Sierra Nevada mountains and of the Iberian peninsula. The village lies to the west of the R√≠o Trev√©lez. It is divided into three parts, the Barrios Bajo, Medio and Alto (lower, mid and upper quarters), with 200 metres of altitude difference between the highest and lowest points. The only bridge over the river is in the Barrio Bajo. The Barrio Bajo is a significant tourist centre, while the Barrios Medio and Alto are more typically Alpujarran in style, though tourism is important to the economy of the entire village. To the west, the nearest village is Busqu√≠star; the road through the Bajo Barrio continues to the east and south to Juviles and Torvizc√≥n. There is a regular bus service along this road, linking the village to the regional centres of Lanjar√≥n and √ìrgiva as well as the provincial capital, Granada. Trev√©lez is famous for the quality of its air- cured hams, a speciality throughout the Alpujarras but particularly associated with the village, because the dry climate due to its altitude makes for ideal conditions for storing them. Trev√©lez celebrates the day of the Virgen de Las Nieves (Virgin of the Snows - see article in external links) in the summer months. On this day the virgin is carried to the summit of Mulhac√©n and a mass is celebrated. The traditional belief is that this will keep travellers safe in the Sierra Nevada for another year.

Regulatory gene cluster These genes were first shown to be arranged into a physically-linked chromosomal cluster in amphioxus, an invertebrate with a single member of each of the three gene families. All the ParaHox genes in the amphioxus genome are therefore in the ParaHox gene cluster. In contrast, the human genome has six ParaHox genes (GSX1, GSX2, PDX1, CDX1, CDX2, CDX4), of which three genes (GSX1, PDX1 (=IPF1), CDX2) are physically linked to form a human ParaHox gene cluster on chromosome 13. Mouse has a homologous ParaHox gene cluster on chromosome 5. The other three human ParaHox genes are remnants from duplicated ParaHox gene clusters that were generated in the 2R genome duplications at the base of vertebrate evolution. Some vertebrates, notably chondrichthyan fish and coelacanths, have retained an additional ParaHox gene (PDX2). The ParaHox gene cluster has been proposed to be a paralogue, or evolutionary sister, of the Hox gene cluster; the two gene clusters being descendent from a segmental duplication early in animal evolution, preceding the divergence of cnidarians and bilaterian animals. It has been suggested that an ancient role of the ParaHox gene cluster in bilaterians was the specify or pattern the through- gut, with Gsx patterning the mouth, Xlox (=Pdx) patterning the midgut and Cdx marking the anus. Gene expression and functional data lends tentative support to this hypothesis, although in many animals the roles of the genes have changed in evolution, notably the Gsx gene family which plays a role in brain (not foregut) development in vertebrates.

KCC operates eight development and production centers, as well as eleven regional information centers. It runs the KCC Information Technology College and its Information Technology Institute. The KCC has branch offices in China, Germany, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. It has an interest in Linux research, and started the development of the Red Star OS distribution localised for North Korea. KCC is a part of the political establishment and not entirely an IT company per se. Its technological state and general modernity are seen as lagging well behind the rest of the world, even with the general zeitgeist in North Korea. For example, the .kp ccTLD was registered in 2007, but KCC did not manage to get a working registry for three years, despite the support of a European company. KCC has still not implemented a working ccTLD infrastructure, something the North Korean government has had as a goal for several years. While KCC mainly works on projects within North Korea, it has since 2001 served clients in Europe, China, South Korea, Japan, and the Middle East.

Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo was adapted into a 76 episodes anime series by the Toei Animation studio between 2003 and 2005.  Career  Sawai made his debut in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump drawing one shot manga such as Mutekiman and Fierce!! Rock Paper Scissors Island!!, all of which have a gag aspect of manga, usually using satire and visual gags. Not too long after beginning to work for Sh≈çnen Jump, Sawai began experimenting with various concepts regarding characters who fought with bizarre bodily functions, including a hero who fought with farts and a poop-headed hero. His most successful experiment was a Fist of the North Star parody involving a strange afro-haired man who fought against \\"Hair Hunters\\" using his nose hairs in a post-apocalyptic society. The character, as well as the story itself, was Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo. Over several one-shots, Sawai further defined Bo-bobo as well as introducing other characters, including damsel-in-distress Beauty, fellow nosehair fighter Gunkan (Captain Battleship), rival fart-fighter Heppokomaru (Gasser), and a strange star- shaped creature and fellow \\"Hajikelist\\" known as Don Patch. After the success of these one-shots, Bo-bobo became a weekly series in 2001, where it had a long and successful run until its conclusion in 2007. Sawai's art style is a mix of very blocky-looking characters and, sometimes, very detailed art. He tends to focus on the realistic appearance of his characters' facial expressions when they freak out. Because of the nature of his series, he has often written Bo-bobo version parodies of other authors' manga, including Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball, Yudetamago's Kinnikuman, Kazuki Takahashi's Yu- Gi-Oh!, and Tsugumi Ohba's and Takeshi Obata's Death Note. He was also the leader of a team of gag-based manga artists (alongside Kyosuke Usuta, Amon Dai and Kouji Ooishi) who wrote a special 30th anniversary chapter of Osamu Akimoto's Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K≈çen-mae Hashutsujo. (Kochi Kame) Sawai returned to the magazine in September 2008 with new series Chagecha. He has also published a children's storybook, Kirarinchoshirizu. In December 2011 Sawai started a spin-off manga of Don Patch from Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo entitled Fuwari! Don Pacchi in Saiky≈ç Jump . A sequel to the spinoff titled \\"Honnori! Don Patch\\" was serialized in the Shonen Jump+ app until its conclusion in August 2015.

Background After the arrest of the Girondist deputies on the 2 June 1793, there followed a series of insurrections within the French cities of Lyon, Avignon, N√Æmes and Marseille known as Federalist revolts. In Toulon, the revolutionaries evicted the existing Jacobin faction but were soon supplanted by the more numerous royalists. Upon the announcement of the recapture of Marseille and of the reprisals which had taken place there at the hands of the revolutionaries, the royalist forces, directed by the Baron d'Imbert, requested support from the Anglo-Spanish fleet. On the twenty-eighth of August, the British and Spanish commanders of the fleet, Admiral Sir Samuel Hood (Royal Navy) and Admiral Juan de L√°ngara (Spanish Navy), responded with 13,000 troops of British, Spanish, Neapolitan and Piedmontese origin. Baron d'Imbert delivered the port of Toulon to the British navy. Toulon hoisted the royal flag, the fleur de lys, and d'Imbert declared the eight-year-old Louis XVII king of France on the first of October. This result produced a potentially mortal situation for the French republic, as the city had a key naval arsenal and was the base for 26 ships of the line (about one third of the total available to the French Navy). Without this port there was little chance for French naval ambitions. As a result, any desire to challenge the Allies, and specifically the British, for control of the seas would be out of the question. In addition, its loss would send a dangerous signal to others preparing to revolt against the republic. Connolly, Owen. The Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon, 1792-1815.

Siege The troops of the army said to be of the \\"Carmagnoles\\", under the command of General Jean Fran√ßois Carteaux, arrived at Toulon on 8 September, after those troops had recovered Avignon and Marseille, and then Ollioules. They joined up with the 6,000 men of the Alpine Maritime Army, commanded by General Jean Fran√ßois Cornu de La Poype, who had just taken La Valette-du-Var, and sought to take the forts of Mont Faron, which dominated the city to the East. They were reinforced by 3,000 sailors under the orders of Admiral de Saint Julien, who refused to serve the British with his chief, Jean-Honor√© de Trogoff de Kerlessy. A further 5,000 soldiers under General La Poype were attached to the army to retake Toulon from the Army of Italy.Chandler 1966, p.20 The Chief of Artillery, commander Elz√©ar Auguste Cousin de Dommartin, having been wounded at Ollioules, had the young captain Napoleon Bonaparte imposed upon him by the special representatives of the Convention and Napoleon's friends ‚ÄîAugustin Robespierre and Antoine Christophe Saliceti. Bonaparte had been in the area escorting a convoy of powder wagons en route to Nice and had stopped in to pay his respects to his fellow Corsican, Saliceti. Bonaparte had been present in the army since the Avignon insurrection (July, 1793), and was imposed on Dommartin in this way despite the mutual antipathy between the two men. Bonaparte at the Siege of Toulon Despite the mutual dislike between Bonaparte and the chief of artillery, the young artillery officer was able to muster an artillery force that was worthy of a siege of Toulon and the fortresses that were quickly built by the British in its immediate environs. He was able to requisition equipment and cannon from the surrounding area. Guns were taken from Marseille, Avignon and the Army of Italy. The local populace, which was eager to prove its loyalty to the republic which it had recently rebelled against, was blackmailed into supplying the besieging force with animals and supplies. His activity resulted in the acquisition of 100 guns for the force. With the help of his friends, the deputies Saliceti and Augustin Robespierre, who held power of life and death, he was able to compel retired artillery officers from the area to re-enlist. The problem of manning the guns was not remedied by this solution alone, and under Bonaparte's intensive training he instructed much of the infantry in the practice of employing, deploying and firing the artillery that his efforts had recently acquired.Chandler 1966, p.24 However, in spite of this effort, Bonaparte was not as confident about this operation as was later his custom. The officers serving with him in the siege were incompetent, and he was becoming concerned about the needless delays due to these officers' mistakes. He was so concerned that he wrote a letter of appeal to the Committee of Public Safety requesting assistance. To deal with his superiors who were wanting in skill, he proposed the appointment of a general for command of the artillery, succeeding himself, so that \\"... (they could) command respect and deal with a crowd of fools on the staff with whom one has constantly to argue and lay down the law in order to overcome their prejudices and make them take steps which theory and practice alike have shown to be axiomatic to any trained officer of this corps\\".Correspondence of Napoleon I, Vol. I, No. 2, p.12 After some reconnaissance, Bonaparte conceived a plan which envisaged the capture of the forts of l'Eguillette and Balaguier, on the hill of Cairo, which would then prevent passage between the small and large harbours of the port, so cutting maritime resupply, necessary for those under siege. Carteaux, reluctant, sent only a weak detachment under Major General Delaborde, which failed in its attempted conquest on 22 September. The allies now alerted, built \\"Fort Mulgrave\\", so christened in honour of the British commander, Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave, on the summit of the hill. It was supported by three smaller ones, called Saint-Phillipe, Saint- C√¥me, and Saint-Charles. The apparently impregnable collection was nicknamed, by the French, \\"Little Gibraltar\\". Bonaparte was dissatisfied by the sole battery‚Äîcalled the \\"Mountain\\", positioned on the height of Saint-Laurent since 19 September. He established another, on the shore of Br√©gallion, called the \\"sans-culottes\\". Hood attempted to silence it, without success, but the British fleet was obliged to harden its resolve along the coast anew, because of the high seabed of Mourillon and la Tour Royale. On the first of October, after the failure of General La Poype against the \\"Eastern Fort\\" of Faron, Bonaparte was asked to bombard the large fort of Malbousquet, whose fall would be required to enable the capture of the city. He therefore requisitioned artillery from all of the surrounding countryside, holding the power of fifty batteries of six cannon apiece. Promoted to Chief of Battalion on 19 October, he organised a grand battery, said to be \\"of the Convention\\", on the hill of Ar√®nes and facing the fort, supported by those of the \\"Camp of the Republicans\\" on the hill of Dumonceau, by those of the \\"Farini√®re\\" on the hill of Gaux, and those of the \\"Poudri√®re\\" at Lagoubran. On 11 November, Carteaux was dismissed and replaced by Fran√ßois Am√©d√©e Doppet, formerly a doctor, whose indecision would cause an attempted surprise against Fort Mulgrave to fail on the 16th. Aware of his own incompetence, he resigned. He was succeeded by a career soldier, Dugommier, who immediately recognized the virtue of Bonaparte's plan, and prepared for the capture of Little Gibraltar. On the 20th, as soon as he arrived, the battery \\"Jacobin\\" was established, on the ridge of l'Evescat. Then, on the left, on 28 November, the battery of the \\"Men Without Fear\\", and then on 14 December, the \\"Chasse Coquins\\" were constructed between the two. Two other batteries were organized to repel the eventual intervention of the allied ships, they were called \\"The Great Harbour\\" and the \\"Four Windmills\\". Pressured by the bombardment, the Anglo-Neapolitans executed a sortie, and took hold of the battery of the \\"Convention\\". A counter-attack, headed by Dugommier and Bonaparte, pushed them back and the British general, Charles O'Hara, was captured. He initiated surrender negotiations with Robespierre the Younger and Antoine Louis Albitte and the Federalist and Royalist battalions were disarmed. Following O'Hara's capture, Dugommier, La Poype, and Bonaparte (now a colonel) launched a general assault during the night of 16 December. Around midnight, the assault began on Little Gibraltar and the fighting continued all night. Bonaparte was injured in the thigh by a British sergeant with a bayonet. However, in the morning, the position having been taken, Marmont was able to place artillery there, against l'Eguillette and Balaguier, which the British had evacuated without confrontation on the same day. During this time, La Poype finally was able to take the forts of Faron and Malbousquet. The allies then decided to evacuate by their maritime route. Commodore Sydney Smith was instructed by Hood to have the delivery fleet and the arsenal burnt. Destruction of the French fleet Admiral Sir Samuel Hood who commanded the British naval forces defending the city. L√°ngara ordered Don Pedro Cotiella to take three boats into the arsenal to destroy the French fleet. Sir Sidney Smith, who had recently arrived, volunteered to accompany him with his ship Swallow and three British boats. Cotiella was tasked with sinking Toulon's hulks; one was a disarmed former British frigate captured during the American Revolutionary War, Montr√©al, and the other was the French frigate Iris.Clowes, p.209 These ships contained the gunpowder stores for the entire fleet and due to the danger of explosion were anchored in the outer roads, some distance from the city. He was then instructed to enter the Old Arsenal and destroy the ships there. The dock gates, which had been barred against attack and manned by 800 former galley slaves freed during the retreat. Their sympathies were with the advancing Republicans so to ensure that they did not interfere, Smith kept his guns trained on them throughout the operation. His boats were spotted by the Republican batteries on the heights and cannonballs and shells landed in the arsenal, although none struck Smith's men. As darkness fell Republican troops reached the shoreline and contributed musketry to the fusillade; Smith replied with grapeshot from his boat's guns.Tracy, p. 44 Destruction of the French fleet at Toulon At 20:00 Captain Charles Hare brought the fire ship HMS Vulcan into the New Arsenal. Smith halted the ship across the row of anchored French ships of the line, and lit the fuses at 22:00. Hare was badly wounded by an early detonation as he attempted to leave his ship.Tracy, p. 42 Simultaneously, fire parties set alight the warehouses and stores ashore, including the mast house and the hemp and timber stores, creating an inferno across the harbour as Vulcans cannons fired a last salvo at the French positions on the shore.James, p.78 With the fires spreading through the dockyards and New Arsenal, Smith began to withdraw. His force was illuminated by the flames, making an inviting target for the Republican batteries. As his boats passed the Iris however the powder ship suddenly and unexpectedly exploded, blasting debris in a wide circle and sinking two of the British boats. On Britannia all of the crew survived, but the blast killed the master and three men on Union.Mostert, p. 116 With the New Arsenal in flames, Smith realised that the Old Arsenal appeared intact; only a few small fires marked the Spanish effort to destroy the French ships anchored within. He immediately led Swallow back towards the arsenal but found that Republican soldiers had captured it intact, their heavy musketry driving him back.Tracy, p. 29 Instead he turned to two disarmed ships of the line, H√©ros and Th√©mistocle, which lay in the inner roads as prison hulks. The French Republican prisoners on board had initially resisted British efforts to burn the ships, but with the evidence of the destruction in the arsenal before them they consented to be safely conveyed to shore as Smith's men set the empty hulls on fire.Tracy, p. 44 =Evacuation= The British evacuation of Toulon in December 1793 With all the available targets on fire or in French hands, Smith withdrew once more, accompanied by dozens of small watercraft packed with Toulonnais refugees and Neapolitan soldiers separated during the retreat. As he passed the second powder hulk, Montr√©al, she also exploded unexpectedly. Although his force was well within the blast radius, on this occasion none of Smith's men were struck by falling debris and his boats retired to the waiting British fleet without further incident. As Smith's boats had gone about their work Hood had ordered HMS Robust under Captain George Elphinstone and HMS Leviathan under Captain Benjamin Hallowell to evacuate the allied troops from the waterfront. They were joined by HMS Courageux under Captain William Waldegrave, which had been undergoing repairs in the Arsenal to replace a damaged rudder. Despite this handicap, Courageux was able to participate in the evacuation and warp out of the harbour with the replacement rudder following behind, suspended between two ship's boats. The fireship HMS Conflagration, also undergoing repairs, was unable to sail and was destroyed during the evacuation. By the morning of 19 December Elphinstone's squadron had retrieved all of the Allied soldiers from the city without losing a single man.James, p.80 In addition to the soldiery, the British squadron and their boats took on board thousands of French Royalist refugees, who had flocked to the waterfront when it became clear that the city would fall to the Republicans. Robust, the last to leave, carried more than 3,000 civilians from the harbour and another 4,000 were recorded on board Princess Royal out in the roads. In total the British fleet rescued 14,877 Toulonnais from the city; witnesses on board the retreating ships reported scenes of panic on the waterfront as stampeding civilians were crushed or drowned in their haste to escape the advancing Republican soldiers, who fired indiscriminately into the fleeing populace.Clowes, p.210 Aftermath =Suppression= The troops of the Convention entered the city on 19 December. The subsequent suppression of Royalists, directed by Paul Barras and Stanislas Fr√©ron, was extremely bloody. It is estimated that between 700 and 800 prisoners were shot or slain by bayonet on Toulon's Champ de Mars. Bonaparte, treated for his injuries by Jean Fran√ßois Hernandez, was not present at the massacre. Promoted to Brigadier General on 22 December, he was already on his way to his new post in Nice as the artillery commander for the Italian Army. A gate, which comprises part of the old walls of the city of Toulon, evokes his departure; a commemorative plaque has been affixed there. This gate is called the Porte d'Italie.

Novator Partners and General Catalyst had previously collectively owned a majority stake in the company, and in September 2018, CCP was acquired by South Korean video game publisher Pearl Abyss for $425 million. CCP Games is best known for developing Eve Online, which was released in 2003 and has since been maintained.  History  CCP Games was founded in June 1997 by Reynir Har√∞arson, √û√≥r√≥lfur Beck Kristj√≥nsson and √çvar Kristj√°nsson for the purpose of making MMORPGs. The name \\"CCP\\" is short for \\"Crowd Control Productions\\". To finance the initial development of Eve Online, CCP Games developed and published a board game, called H√¶ttuspil (\\"Danger Game\\"). The game sold more than 10,000 copies to Iceland's 80,000 households. In April 2000 the company, with Sigur√∞ur Arnlj√≥tsson as CEO, raised $2.6 million, through a closed offering organised by Kaupthing Bank, from private investors in Iceland, including the Icelandic telephone company S√≠minn. He was with the company from 1999 to 2002 during which time the company raised two rounds of financing and secured a contract with publisher Simon & Schuster. Approximately half of the initial 21 employees came from Icelandic dot-com company OZ Interactive. = White Wolf Publishing acquisition and CCP North America = On 11 November 2006, it was announced that CCP Games had entered a merger agreement with White Wolf Publishing. With the merge, the combined company planned to produce \\"the industry's most innovative games leveraging both online and offline systems\\". While CCP Games looked into creating online games based on White Wolf Publishing's properties, White Wolf Publishing would in turn create card games based on Eve Online. On 3 October 2007, CCP Games announced that CCP North America, a new video game-focused subsidiary, would be set up within White Wolf Publishing's Stone Mountain, Georgia location on 12 October, hiring 100 developers. White Wolf Publishing president Mike Tinney was additionally promoted head of CCP North America. In February 2011, CCP Games announced that intentions to expand the location from their presently 150 positions to 300, and move the studio to new housing in Decatur, Georgia. However, when CCP Games let go 20% of their worldwide staff, most of these layoffs occurred at CCP North America. On 27 February 2012, Tinney stated that he had departed from both operations to focus on his new gaming-and-health startup, UtiliFIT. In December 2013, further 15 people from the World of Darkness Online development team were let go. White Wolf Publishing was acquired by Paradox Interactive on 29 October 2015. The deal comprised an undisclosed all-cash sum for CCP Games, and the company assets of White Wolf Publishing, their intellectual property and the rights to World of Darkness Online for Paradox Interactive. = Restructuring (2011‚Äì2017) = Hilmar Veigar P√©tursson, CEO of CCP, in 2017 In October 2011, following a large controversy over its introduction of microtransactions to the game EVE Online, CCP Games announced that it would be reducing its staff. CCP Games released an announcement to its community admitting that they had made a mistake by releasing the Incarna expansion in its current development stage. In the wake of the Incarna expansion and following a mass protest by EVE Online players, CCP Games announced that it had decided to prioritise and shift their focus from their World of Darkness MMO back to their EVE-Universe products, EVE Online and Dust 514. The restructuring resulted in the layoffs of 20% of CCP Games' staff worldwide. The majority of these layoffs affected the Atlanta, United States, office, but also affected were several positions in CCP headquarters in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. Even though after considerable downsizing, CCP Games claims that EVE Online and its development is stronger than ever and that the company will continue to grow. CCP Games confirmed that they had moved away from the Incarna/Ambulation project to focus on the core game mechanics and that Incarna may be revisited further down the line. On 28 August 2014, CCP Games shut down its San Francisco studio to refocus their efforts on EVE Online. At the same time, CFO Joe Gallo and CMO David Reid resigned. As of 2015, none of CCP Games' original founders were still with the company. On 30 October 2017, CCP Games announced it would shutter its Atlanta studio, and sell off its Newcastle studio, affecting approximately 100 employees. It announced that it would shift its focus from VR development to PC and mobile game development. =Acquisition by Pearl Abyss (2018‚Äìpresent)= Pearl Abyss, the South Korean publisher of Black Desert Online, announced on 6 September 2018 that they had agreed to acquire CCP Games for about .

CCP Games later reacquired the rights to publish EVE Online and continues to manage it to this day. EVE Online's core gameplay revolves around player decisions around mining, exploration, industry, factional warfare and piracy. A major design choice is the freedom to do what would be illegal activities, such as scamming for in-game items. = Dust 514 = On 18 August 2009, Hilmar Veigar P√©tursson announced Dust 514, a new ground-based first-person shooter (FPS) with real-time strategy elements being developed by CCP Games' Shanghai office.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1953 to 1958, initially as a Social Credit representative and later as an independent. The son of Adrian Henry Bullmore and Annie Andrew, Bullmore was educated in Minnedosa, and worked as a manufacturer. He was the president of Dauphin Products Ltd. and also established the Bullmore Funeral Home. He married Arla Maynes, from Harrowby, Manitoba, on August 11, 1936 and they had two children, who were named James William Bullmore and Arla Anne Bullmore Porter. He served in Dauphin as a Councillor from 1944 to 1945, and was the town's mayor from 1946 to 1955. He was the first president of the Manitoba Urban League. Bullmore was also an active freemason, and was involved with several masonic organizations. Bullmore's decision to run for the Social Credit Party was a surprise to many political observers, as he had been encouraged by some members of the Liberal Party to run federally under their banner. In his nomination speech, he acknowledged that some of his friends had warned him against running for Social Credit, suggesting it would be \\"political suicide\\". He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1953 election, defeating Liberal-Progressive candidate John Potoski by 174 votes in the Dauphin constituency. Incumbent Progressive Conservative Ernest N. McGirr finished third. Bullmore was one of only two Social Credit MLAs to serve in Manitoba's 1953-58 parliament. According to the Winnipeg Free Press, his early speeches in the legislature were focused on issues of monetary reform. He left the Social Credit Party in 1956 over contributions to the Social Credit Party from the Manitoba breweries. He did not seek re-election in the 1958 provincial election. Bullmore moved to Winnipeg in 1958 and died there at the age of 59 following a lengthy illness.

History =Origins= The County of Salm arose in the 10th century in Vielsalm, in the Ardennes region of present Belgium. It was ruled by a junior branch of the House of Luxembourg, called the House of Salm. In 1165, it was divided into the counties of Lower Salm, in the Ardennes, situated in Belgium and Luxembourg, and the county of Upper Salm, situated in the Vosges mountains, present France. =Lower Salm= The counts of Lower Salm became extinct in 1416, and the county was inherited by the House of Reifferscheid-Dyck. In 1628 the county was elevated to an altgraviate, and henceforth the fief was renamed the Altgraviate of Salm- Reifferscheid. In 1639 the Altgraviate was divided up into the Altgraviate of Salm-Reifferscheid-Bedburg, to the Northwest of Cologne, and the Altgraviate of Salm-Reifferscheid-Dyck, Neuss. Salm-Reifferscheid-Bedburg In 1734 the Altgraviate of Salm-Reifferscheid-Bedburg was divided in three by splitting off the Altgraviate of Salm-Reifferscheid-Raitz, from Bohemian descent, and the Altgraviate of Salm-Reifferscheid-Hainsbach from the original altgraviate. In 1803 the, smaller, Altgraviate of Salm-Reifferscheid-Bedburg was renamed the Altgraviate of Salm-Reifferscheid-Krautheim. In 1804 it was raised to a principality, und existed until 1806, when it was mediatised. Salm-Reifferscheid-Dyck The county was mediatised, and the family branch became extinct in 1888. =Upper Salm= In 1246 the County of Upper Salm was split up, and the County of Salm-Blankenburg came into existence, next to it. In 1431 the County of Upper Salm was split up again, and the County of Salm-Badenweiler came into existence, next to it. The County of Upper Salm was inherited by the Wild- and Rhinegraves in 1475, who then called their fief the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Upper Salm. In 1499 the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm was divided up into two entities, the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm-Kyrburg and the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm-Dhaun. Salm-Blankenburg The county became extinct in 1506, and was inherited by the House of Lorraine. Salm-Badenweiler In 1520 the County of Salm- Badenweiler was split up, and the County of Salm-Neuburg came into existence, next to it. In 1653 the fief was inherited by the Austrian House of Sinzendorf, but the House of Salm kept using the title until 1784, when the last lord died. The county was annexed by the House of Lorraine from 1600 until 1608, when it came back into the family. 1670 the territory was finally annexed by France. Salm-Kyrburg In 1607 the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm-Kyrburg was divided in three by splitting off the Wild- and Rhinagraviate of Salm-M√∂rchingen and the Wild- and Rhinagraviate of Salm-Tronecken from the original Wild- and Rhinegraviate. In 1637 the lord of Salm-Tronecken died and his territories were joined with ... . In 1681 the last lord of Salm-Kyrburg died, and his territories were joined with Salm-M√∂rchingen. In 1688 the last lord of Salm-M√∂rchingen died. His territories were joined with ... . In 1743 a completely new territory of Salm-Kyrburg was created, this time the Principality of Salm-Kyrburg. It was shortly annexed by France in 1811 and mediatised in 1813. But the family kept using the titles. Salm-Dhaun In 1561 the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm-Neuweiler and the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm-Grumbach were split off Salm-Dhaun. In 1697 the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm-P√ºttlingen was split off Salm-Dhaun. In 1748 the Salm-Dhaun branch of the family became extinct, its territories went to the branch of Salm-P√ºttlingen. =Salm-P√ºttlingen= Salm-P√ºttlingen became extinct in 1750. Their territories went to ... . =Salm-Neuweiler= In 1610 the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm was split off Salm-Neuweiler. It was elevated to the Principality of Salm in 1623. In 1803, when the Bishopric of M√ºnster was secularized, part of it was given to the princes of Salm-Salm who by then already were in possession of the Lordship of Anholt. This new Principality of Salm, covering the area around Borken, Ahaus and Bocholt, was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine. In 1810 it was annexed by France, as a part of the Imperial d√©partement of Lippe. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, it was mediatized to Prussia. The family branch exist until today. In 1696 Salm-Neuweiler was divided in two, the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm- Leuze and the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Salm-Hoogstraten. Their lands were incorporated into Belgium. The branches became extinct in 1887 and 1186. =Salm-Grumbach= In 1668 the Wild- and Rhinegraviate of Rheingrafenstein-Grenzweiler was split off Salm-Grumbach. It was mediatised and incorporated into Prussia. The branch extinction occurred in 1819. In 1803 Salm-Grumbach was annexed by France. The lords of Salm-Grumbach received the Principality of Salm-Horstmar as compensation in 1803. It was mediatised in 1813. The family branch sold its titles to Salm-Salm in 1892.

The \\"Samael/Lilith\\" version. The Sigil of Baphomet is the official insignia of the Church of Satan. It first appeared on the cover of The Satanic Mass LP in 1968 and later on the cover of The Satanic Bible in 1969. The sigil has been called a \\"material pentagram\\" representational of carnality and earthy principles. The Church describes the symbol as the \\"...preeminent visual distillation of the iconoclastic philosophy of Satanism.\\" History In the literature and imagery predating LaVey, imagery used to represent the \\"Satanic\\" is denoted by inverted crosses and blasphemous parodies of Christian art. The familiar goat's head inside an inverted pentagram did not become the foremost symbol of Satanism until the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966. The original goat pentagram containing the Hebrew letters at the five points of the pentagram spelling out Leviathan (◊ú◊ï◊ô◊™◊ü) first appeared in the book La Clef de la Magie Noire by French occultist Stanislas de Guaita, in 1897. This symbol was later used in Maurice Bessy's book A Pictorial History of Magic and the SupernaturalOriginal , 1961; English edition first published in 1964, with the words \\"Samael\\" and \\"Lilith\\" removed. During his years of research into the \\"black arts\\", LaVey had come across this book and added it to his collection. When he chose to turn his magic circle, the Order of the Trapezoid, into the Church of Satan, he decided that the symbol was the one which most fully embodied the principles which were the bedrock of the Satanic church. Contrary to claims made against the Church by detractors, LaVey never claimed to have created this particular symbol. In its formative years, this particular version of the symbol was utilized by the Church on membership cards, stationary, medallions and most notably above the altar in the ritual chamber of the Black House. During the writing of The Satanic Bible, it was decided that a unique version of the symbol should be rendered to be identified exclusively with the Church. The complete graphic now known as the Sigil of Baphomet, named such for the first time in LaVey's The Satanic Rituals, first appeared on the cover of The Satanic Mass LP in 1968 and later on the cover of The Satanic Bible in 1969. This version was drawn by LaVey and attributed to \\"Hugo Zorilla\\" (a pseudonym used by LaVey in some of his art). The sigil, when combined with the text \\"The First Church ov Satan\\", was previously trademarked by the Church of Satan, but the trademark was abandoned in 2000. The Satanic Temple uses a personalized version of the Sigil of Baphomet as its official logo. In this redesign of the symbol, the goat's head, the inverted pentagram, the organization's acronym (TST), and the circumcircle are depicted as black silhouettes.

The series was in four parts, with parts 2‚Äì4 having a tagline on their cover. Plot =Part 1= The story begins in a sewer-residing community at an undisclosed location (possibly on Earth). The characters are looking for someone when they find a seemingly decrepit woman in rags. At her request they attempt to help her stand, and she attacks them, beating the larger men easily before Annalee Call (Winona Ryder's character from Alien: Resurrection) identifies herself to the woman, who is revealed to be Ripley #8, the clone of Ellen Ripley (also from Alien: Resurrection). Call then takes Ripley back to her base of operations, where she expresses her sadness that Ripley left her after their promise to stay together after Alien: Resurrection. She informs Ripley of a new military operation on the science station Typhoon, involving a hybrid Alien super soldier, led by a Dr. Trollenberg. Also at this point, Ripley explains that she nearly didn't sign on for her position on the Nostromo (the start of the Alien story). The story moves to Dr. Trollenberg working on the super soldier. He is approached by General Helm, who is in charge of the station and intent on shutting down the project after Trollenberg requested cybernetic components. The doctor opens fire and kills the general and his two guards, before changing his voice to match the general's and hailing the bridge, informing them that the general will remain with him in the lab until the completion of the project and can only be contacted there. He finishes by throwing the three bodies into a vat of acid. Back at Call's base, Ripley is still yet to be convinced to join the mission to stop Trollenberg's project. Ripley mentions that she no longer has nightmares about the aliens; she plainly states that they \\"can't be stopped. The aliens are coming and the human race is going to suffer...they just do what they have to do. And then you're dead and it's over.\\" Eventually Call blackmails Ripley, saying she will inform the military of her location, to which Ripley replies, \\"I could learn to hate you.\\" Meanwhile, a Predator is traveling toward the Typhoon, intent on hunting the super soldier. Call, her crew and Ripley infiltrate the station disguised as \\"the World's Most Unexceptional Food Delivery Service,\\" and after killing the guards, move into Trollenberg's lab. Inside, they find Trollenberg, who proceeds to kill two of Call's crew (Echo and Saud) before the cloaked Predator decapitates him with its disc, leaving Call, Ripley, and the survivors stunned. Immediately, the now-decloaked Predator is thrown back into the room, only to be followed by the hulking form of the prototype super soldier who proceeds to fight the Predator. =Part 2: Monster vs. Machine= Ripley, Call and her surviving crew (Blades and Voorman) stand stunned as the prototype supersoldier and Predator fight, noting that the super soldier is almost impervious to harm and is able to absorb metal objects to regenerate damage. After tearing off one of the Predator's arms, the super soldier moves to absorb a portion of the exterior bulkhead of the lab, opening a hole into the vacuum which quickly dispatches the Predator. Moving quickly back towards their shuttle (Carthage), with Trollenberg's head, the heroes quickly escape before the space station explodes from the breach, while the super soldier boards a smaller science vessel/escape pod, taking with it some alien chestbursters. As the space station explodes, Ripley has a bad feeling that the super soldier survived and, in the 'science pod', the super soldier commences work on a second super soldier who was also near completion. Call suggests she hack into Trollenberg's skull to learn more about him, explaining that the skull and its wiring \\"is very weird... advanced in some ways, in others a real antique\\". Once inside Trollenberg's memory, she encounters a shell program and is approached by an interactive recording of John Connor, who goes on to explain the Skynet war, concluding with the \\"Skynet Resurrection Program\\" which used a model known as the Crypto Terminators (of which Trollenberg was one) which were capable of existing in civilization indefinitely until such time that technological advancements would allow for a new generation of Terminators which would be unstoppable (during this, scenes from Trollenberg's existence are shown, including the creation of the super soldier). The recording finishes with \\"the victorious forces of the 21st Century salute you... and wish you good luck\\". Logging out of Trollenberg's memories, Call expresses concern that this is simply another great cover-up in history, but the discussion is cut short by three Predator spacecraft surrounding their ship. A trio of Predators teleport on board; Voorman attacks one of the Predators but is easily knocked away, while another grabs Ripley and lightly cuts her arm with its wrist blades, watching as her acidic blood burns the floor. The three Predators teleport off the ship with Ripley and their craft disappears. Elsewhere, the science pod reaches its destination (revealed in Part 3 as the Navy heavy cruiser Euphrates) and the prototype disembarks, now accompanied by a new super soldier. =Part 3: Ripley... And Company= On the Carthage, Voorman is being treated by Blades for the head injury he received from the Predator attack. Call surmises the Predators knew of Ripley's genetic heritage just as they did and that they most likely want her to assist in the threat posed by the super soldiers; she even wonders if they too encountered John Connor's sleeper virus, and ultimately decides they must use all this new information to their advantage. Meanwhile, on one of the Predators' spacecraft, Ripley stands on a teleportation pad watching the Predators remove their helmets, who then leave her to go about their business. Ripley comments \\"Just when I think my life can't get any stranger... Just when I think I've fallen as far as I can fall... The bottom drops out and I wind up amazed and horrified all over again.\\" She considers herself to now be beyond terror or outrage, even towards the Predators or their current disinterest in her. She walks through the craft, observing the work of the Predator armourers, and notes that the Predators are exuding an aura of menace throughout the 'heavy, nitrogen-rich air' of their craft, directed not at her, who she considers they currently deem worthless, but at something else, something connected to her DNA. Ripley finds herself in a trophy room filled with dozens of Alien corpses and body parts, and understands that the Predators' lives revolve around the Aliens and that they know that both the super soldier and she are part Alien, which leads her to wonder if they are merely adding her to their trophy collection. A Predator moves up behind her, reaching for her, causing her to recoil in anger, punching the Predator to little effect before he throws her over his shoulder and carries her away. She is taken to a circular operating table and tied down whilst a breathing apparatus is attached to her face, followed by a thin needle drill moving towards her. She resists throughout, comparing them to the military who created her, commenting \\"I guess I haven't fallen past terror after all...\\". On the Euphrates, the ship's commanding officer complains about the 'android survivors' of the Typhoon and the super soldiers' request to be transferred to a high security asteroid facility. The CO has been uneasy since they arrived and has them restricted to the science pod. He approaches the pod and explains the delay, much to the original super soldier's displeasure, who demands access to the bridge, which the CO denies them. Shortly after a message arrives from Command, refusing the super soldiers access to the 'Black Asteroid'; this results in both super soldiers re-entering the science pod, launching and ramming the pod further into the Euphrates. The super soldiers then disembark with firearms, quickly killing the crew present before the prototype super soldier begins to absorb parts of the cruiser's interior, resulting in critical damage to the ship's primary systems, including life support. On the Carthage, Call has determined that the Predators would be following the most likely course of the super soldier towards the nearest large source of Aliens' genetic material: Los Alamos 235, the large hill also known as mons veneris or the 'Black Asteroid'. Back on the Predators' spacecraft, Ripley experiences a dream where she is swimming in Aliens and encounters a ghostly image of a traditional Terminator endoskeleton before awaking. Regaining consciousness, Ripley notices a scar on the left rear side of her neck and is led from the operating table, past an assembled room of Predators in a Cleft of Venus formation, to a viewing screen of Los Alamos 235, sensing that there are Aliens within and that the Predators extracted this information from her DNA, from the Alien 'genetic memory'. Nearby, the Euphrates is granted access to the Black Asteroid and opens fire on the station's control room. In the Predators' craft, Ripley has returned to the room of assembled Predators and undergoes a pre-battle ritual where she is given an Alien tooth necklace and is covered in Predator blood warpaint. Throughout the process, Ripley considers that there are monsters in this world, but the Predators are not them - they simply do what they must to survive and maintain balance in the universe when it comes to the Aliens, and that they see the arrival of the Terminator hybrids as an imbalance to the ecology of the stars, and that is the true evil. She understands that at any other time she would instead be merely a \\"scalp on their belts\\", but the current situation has made them allies and she knows \\"they didn't much care for my human side... But, oh, do they respect and approve of the Alien in me!\\". Ripley knows she will soon \\"do battle with the great abomination from Earth's wretched past\\", as the super soldiers take control of the ship and make their way to a room filled with fully-grown Aliens in containment tubes. Ripley looks forward to destroying the man-made \\"agents of true human evil\\", and in regards to the Aliens on board, she will \\"ride the whirlwind to glorious annihilation. Until then, I am learning to love the Alien\\". =Part 4: Future Hell= The next day, hidden amongst the smaller asteroids around Los Alamos 235, the Carthage and her crew watch the space surrounding the Black Asteroid, where an entire fleet of military ships have arrived to retake the station only to be wiped out by a powerful energy surge launched from the asteroid's entry point, draining the station of all external power and lowering its defences. The Carthage moves towards the station, entering unnoticed through the entry point as Call wonders whether the Predators have already made it here and if Ripley is still alive. Inside, Ripley lies alongside a Predator on the ground in a field of orange smoke as a monstrous super soldier crouches over them, bearing the appearance of a dark blue, muscular, bald humanoid with red eyes, fangs, clawed hands and biomechanical 'veins' at its neck and wrists. Ripley considers that the day hadn't turned out like she'd hoped as she underwent the ritual the day before, remembering how they entered the asteroid, slipping unnoticed past its defenses and the fleet outside. They had observed that, in less than 24 hours, the two super soldiers had created an entire sophisticated manufacturing plant which quickly grew more of the new blue skinned hybrids, and Ripley and the Predators attacked without hesitation. Quickly, as on the Typhoon, the Predators were killed at every turn and even when a dying Predator activated its self- destruct device a super soldier sacrificed itself, wrapping its larger body around the Predator to absorb almost the entirety of the blast. Ripley crawled away from the scene of the battle, finding herself amongst a stockpile of fully-grown Aliens, and saw a chance to even the odds and do what she was born to do, deactivating the stasis effect of the tubes, \\"to release the Hounds of Hell!\\". The Aliens quickly set upon the super soldiers and the Aliens' true power was revealed when a Predator killed one with his shoulder cannon, showering nearby super soldiers with acidic blood, critically wounding the hybrids. The remaining Predators used this to their advantage, unleashing blasts which spilt fatal bursts of acidic blood, killing both super soldiers and Aliens together with each shot although, ultimately, they were themselves overwhelmed by the Aliens once the last of the new super soldiers had died. Ripley watches the carnage, frozen in place as the remaining Predators and super soldiers die, but the appearance of the prototype super soldier refocuses her and she follows through the station after him, knowing that if he escapes all their sacrifices will be for nothing. Rounding a corner, Ripley strikes out at the shadows of Call and Voorman, believing them to be the prototype, to the shock of all three of them. Ripley doesn't care for how they got there and insists that they go back the way they came and leave the station, telling them they will not survive if they go on any further and that there is nothing they can do. In the end, Ripley thanks Call: \\"You did the right thing, bringing me back out into the black, I know that now. Please  go. Let me do what I can do... Let me finish the job\\". Voorman agrees with Ripley and drags Call back to the Carthage, commenting that Call is \\"a lot closer to human than she is\\" as they leave. As Ripley returns to follow the original super soldier, the station begins to shake as the internal structure starts to collapse. Reaching the Carthage, Call frees herself of Voorman's grip and starts to run back into the station after Ripley, but Voorman quickly captures her and takes her aboard the Carthage, tying her to one of the seats to stop her from going after Ripley again. Throughout the process, Call resists Voorman's actions, commenting that she brought Ripley out here and forced all of this on her. Meanwhile, Ripley slips on board the ship and the hybrid prototype also boards. The Carthage quickly exits the station, followed by the super soldier's ship, just as the station explodes. Ripley stalks towards the prototype, moving through the ship's internal piping. Ripley considers the similarities to what happened a time long ago on the Nostromo's escape pod, the Narcissus, where she was at the controls and the enemy stalked her instead. She realises that even now, with the roles reversed, she is just as terrified as she was then as she leaps forward to kill the prototype with a Predator knife, only to be knocked aside due to its superior speed and reflex response. Deciding to go with 'Plan B', Ripley cuts her left arm with the blade, waving it to spread her acidic blood as the super soldier holds her above him, his hands around her neck and right shoulder respectively. Ripley's blood begins to burn through the viewing panel of the airlock door, causing flames from the explosion that surrounded the ship to flood in, resulting in its destruction. On board the Carthage, Call has been released from the seat and is at one of the monitors when Blades comments on an explosion that occurred, separate from the one of the station. Call comments that it was Ripley finishing the job: \\"She cleaned up the mess that we stumbled into. What the Connor virus told me  about Skynet returning? She closed the book on that. I know she did. I forced her back out there. I got her into this. I'm going to have to live with that. I hope she made her peace. I think she got her dignity back. And her soul, maybe. Yeah. And her soul. And maybe she saved mankind's soul in the bargain. Let's go home.\\" Collected editions The work has been collected as a trade paperback: * Aliens versus Predator versus The Terminator (Dark Horse Comics, 96 pages, 2001, ) See also Other related comic series include: *Aliens *Alien vs. Predator *Predator *The Terminator References  External links *Official Dark Horse website Category:Alien vs. Predator (franchise) comics Category:Comics based on films Category:Intercompany crossovers Category:Terminator (franchise) comics ","title":"Aliens versus Predator versus The Terminator"},{"id":"1964595","text":"Fothergilla (witch alder) is a genus of two or three species of flowering plants in the family Hamamelidaceae, native to woodland and swamps of the southeastern United States.

BNC and twisted pair cabling A cable tester is an electronic device used to verify the electrical connections in a signal cable or other wired assembly. Basic cable testers are continuity testers that verify the existence of a conductive path between ends of the cable, and verify the correct wiring of connectors on the cable. More advanced cable testers can measure the signal transmission properties of the cable such as its resistance, signal attenuation, noise and interference. Terry William Ogletree, Upgrading and Repairing Networks,Que Publishing 2004, , page 961 Basic tester Generally a basic cable tester is a battery operated portable instrument with a source of electric current, one or more voltage indicators, and possibly a switching or scanning arrangement to check each of several conductors sequentially. A cable tester may also have a microcontroller and a display to automate the testing process and show the testing results, especially for multiple-conductor cables. A cable tester may be connected to both ends of the cable at once, or the indication and current source portions may be separated to allow injection of a test current at one end of a cable and detection of the results at the distant end. Both portions of such a tester will have connectors compatible with the application, for example, modular connectors for Ethernet local area network cables. A cable tester is used to verify that all of the intended connections exist and that there are no unintended connections in the cable being tested. When an intended connection is missing it is said to be \\"open\\". When an unintended connection exists it is said to be a \\"short\\" (a short circuit). If a connection \\"goes to the wrong place\\" it is said to be \\"miswired\\" (the connection has two faults: it is open to the correct contact and shorted to an incorrect contact). Generally, the testing is done in two phases. The first phase, called the \\"opens test\\" makes sure each of the intended connections is good. The second phase, called the \\"shorts test\\" makes sure there are no unintended connections. There are two common ways to test a connection: # A continuity test. Current is passed down the connection. If there is current the connection is assumed to be good. This type of test can be done with a series combination of a battery (to provide the current) and a light bulb (that lights when there is a current). # A resistance test. A known current is passed down the connection and the voltage that develops is measured. From the voltage and current the resistance of the connection can be calculated and compared to the expected value. There are two common ways to test for a short: # A low voltage test. A low power, low voltage source is connected between two conductors that should not be connected and the amount of current is measured. If there is no current the conductors are assumed to be well isolated. # A high voltage test. Again a voltage source is connected but this time the voltage is of several hundred volts. The increased voltage will make the test more likely to find connections that are nearly shorted since the higher voltage will cause the insulation of nearly shorted wires to break down. Signal testers More powerful cable testers can measure the properties of the cable relevant to signal transmission. These include the DC resistance of the cable, the loss of signal strength (attenuation) of a signal at one or more frequencies, and a measure of the isolation between multiple pairs of a multi-pair cable or crosstalk. While these instruments are several times the cost and complexity of basic continuity testers, these measurements may be required to certify that a cable installation meets the technical standards required for its use, for example, in local area network cabling. Optical cable testers An optical cable tester contains a visible light source and a connector compatible with the optical cable installation. A visible light source is used, so that detection can be done by eye. More advanced optical cable testers can verify the signal loss properties of an optical cable and connectors.

Albert Vilar, (born October 4, 1940) is an American former investment manager who became particularly known as a patron of opera companies, performing arts organizations, and educational institutions. Following the collapse of his investment firm, Amerindo Investment Advisors, he was tried and convicted in November 2008 on charges of money laundering, investment advisor fraud, securities fraud, mail and wire fraud. He was sentenced in February 2010 to nine years in prison and released in 2018. Background Originally from West Orange, New Jersey, Vilar earned an economics degree from Washington & Jefferson College, a liberal arts college in Washington, Pennsylvania. He then earned a master's degree in economics at Iona College in New Rochelle, New York. In 1979, along with Gary Tanaka, he founded Amerindo Investment Advisors, an investment advisory firm based in San Francisco and New York, with offices in London. In 1981, Vilar made his first $1 million. Amerindo's main investment activities were in technology funds, which the stock market crash of 2000 severely affected. The value of the Amerindo funds declined sharply, and Vilar began to default on his pledges to arts institutions. Vilar has served on the Washington & Jefferson College Board of Trustees. Donations to opera companies and other organizations The arts organisations to which Vilar pledged donations included: * Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (ROH) in central London, where the Floral Hall, one of the major foyers of the redeveloped house, was named the \\"Vilar Floral Hall\\" in recognition of a 1999 pledge of ¬£10 million. The ROH changed the name of its atrium to the Floral Hall in September 2005 after Vilar paid only a fraction of his original ¬£10 million pledge. Subsequently, he pledged money for the \\"Young Artists Programme\\", several opera production sponsorships, and for the installation of seat back titles in the main auditorium. * The Salzburg Festival received its largest donation in its 81-year history from Vilar. He in turn received a full-page color photo of himself in every program book. * Metropolitan Opera was pledged amounts thought to total $45 million. With $12 million actually given to the company, he remains as its third largest donor. * The Kirov Opera located in the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia has been another major beneficiary of Vilar's support, which is said to have been around $14 million and was focused primarily on supporting the summer White Nights Festival. * Washington DC's Kennedy Center, under its President, Michael Kaiser who had developed a relationship with Vilar when the former was at the Royal Opera House, received donations to create an arts-management program, the \\"Vilar Institute for Arts Management\\" plus pledges for a program to bring the Kirov Opera to the Center on an annual basis. In 2001 Vilar pledged $50 million toward the Center's activities. Again, actual payments fell short, and the Center has had to seek alternative sources of financial support. * The Washington National Opera and the Los Angeles Opera both received support from Vilar due to his connection to Pl√°cido Domingo, who was then the General and Artistic Director of both companies. $10 million was pledged to each company. * The Maazel-Vilar Conductor's Competition. * New York University has the Alberto Vilar Global Fellows in the Performing Arts program, which began in 2002 with a $23.4 million donation to attract and bring young performing artists to study in New York for two years. It has been described by NYU as a Rhodes Scholars-style program. * Beaver Creek, Colorado has the Vilar Center for the Arts and the Ford Amphitheater/Vilar Pavilion in Vail, Colorado. * Washington & Jefferson College began construction of a new technology building, which was to be named \\"The Vilar Technology Center,\\" based on a multimillion-dollar pledge by Vilar. With the pledge failing to fully materialize, funds were diverted from elsewhere, allowing for the scaled back building, along with its scaled back name of the \\"Technology Center\\" to be completed. * Vilar Distinguished Artist Series at Washington & Jefferson College, featuring Lorin Maazel and Susan Graham As a result of his philanthropy, in 2002 the Americans for the Arts organization gave him their National Arts Award, for \\"Corporate Citizenship in the Arts\\". As noted in James Stewart's 2006 New Yorker profile of Vilar, at some point in 2002, Vilar was hospitalized for a series of operations on his back, and he claims to have nearly died as the result of complications: \\"they were ready to give me the last rites\\".James Stewart, \\"The Opera Lover\\" There was speculation that he might have missed some planned donations as the result of his illness. A lasting effect, however, clearly came from the severe decline in his personal fortune due to the crash in technology stocks around 2000. It is documented that Vilar still continued to make pledges even as his personal and his company's fortunes continued to plunge. Among the pledges were $5 million for money for voice loss research after meeting Julie Andrews and $30 million to a Berlin opera company: \\"Asking Alberto for money was like offering an alcoholic a drink\\".A close friend of Vilar's quoted in Stewart, \\"The Opera Lover\\" However, many of his pledges were never paid. Fraud conviction Vilar and Tanaka were arrested on May 26, 2005, on charges of securities fraud.Ben Mattison, \\"Opera Patron Alberto Vilar Jailed on Fraud Charges\\", playbillarts, May 28, 2005\\"Once a billionaire, now a prisoner: Scandal dogs tech investor Alberto Vilar, accused of fleecing investors out of millions of dollars\\" money.cnn, May 30, 2005 The government claimed that the two appropriated as much as $5 million of an Amerindo client Lily Cates' (heiress and mother of actress Phoebe Cates) money for personal use. It was alleged that Vilar used the money to pay for some home repairs and to make good on previously-promised charitable contributions. It was also alleged that Tanaka used money to purchase thoroughbred race horses. The SEC also filed a civil suit. .\\"Alberto Vilar Spends More Time in Jail While His Amerindo Investment Advisers Teeters on the Brink\\" lawprofessrors.typepad.com, June 6, 2005 According to Stewart's article in The New Yorker, an extensive analysis of Vilar's rise and fall, \\"Vilar maintains that when he was arrested he was on the brink of a financial comeback. Everything I predicted about the Internet has come true.... I'm ready to go back to work and make money.\\" Stewart continues: \\"if convicted, Vilar and Tanaka face fines of more than ten million dollars and prison terms of up to a hundred and fifty-five years. But Vilar says, 'We'll sort this out. I'll get beyond this. I will always try to help others.... I still love opera and classical music.... The Met is not going to get my money, but it will not kill my love of music.'\\" The charges did not allege wrongdoing at Amerindo's mutual funds, and when the firm was wound up there were no missing funds. But Morningstar, a fund analysis company, advised investors to withdraw their money in any case, because the funds had been performing very poorly. In fact, as with many other funds investing in internet companies, investors had already been pulling out for some time, reducing assets and causing expense ratios to increase. Extensive seizures of records and computers in the course of the investigation compelled Amerindo's board to merge the fund with Munder Capital Management's fund, Munder NetNet, later renamed Munder Internet. The seizures were ruled excessive by a federal judge in early 2007. Vilar and Tanaka's trial began in September 2008, with Herald Price Fahringer as Vilar's defence attorney and Glenn Colton representing Tanaka. The trial concluded on November 19, 2008 with the conviction of Vilar on all 12 counts with which he had been charged and the conviction of Tanaka on 3 counts. On February 5, 2010, Vilar was sentenced to nine years in prison, while Tanaka was sentenced to five years. They were both featured in the fifth season of the television series American Greed. In October 2012, after having served more than 2 1/2 years at the Fort Dix, New Jersey, Federal Correctional Institution, the appeals court, over the objections of the prosecution, ordered his immediate release pending the appeal. Vilar and Tanaka were returned to jail in November 2013. In April 2014, Vilar was returned to prison, and sentenced to an additional year for preventing the victims' families from recovering their lost funds. Consequences of his failures to pay promised donations In a 2000 interview with Philipp Blom, Vilar had estimated his donations to opera houses and other performing arts centers in some 150 million dollars granted over the previous 10 yearsTo Have and to Hold - An Intimate History of Collectors and Collecting, Allen Lane/Penguin, London, 2002 Many of the organizations to which Vilar had pledged donations gradually began to remove his name from parts of their institutions where it had been prominently placed. In July 2005 the Royal Opera House announced that, following Vilar's failure to maintain the agreed payment schedule, his name would be removed from the building. Later his name was removed from the young artists program when a new donor stepped forward. At the Metropolitan Opera, where his name appeared on the \\"Vilar Grand Tier\\", it has since been removed. The Washington Opera's young artists program has also been renamed (after additional support was found) as the \\"Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program\\", and the Kennedy Center's \\"Arts Management Fellowship\\" program has similarly dropped the Vilar name.

Renshaw. Renshaw was laid down 7 May 1942 by the Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Company in Kearny, New Jersey; launched on 13 October 1942, sponsored by Miss Dorothy Lillian Renshaw; and commissioned on 5 December 1942, with Lieutenant Commander C. F. Chillingworth in command.  South Pacific, 1943 - 1944  Following shakedown, Renshaw reported to the Pacific Fleet in the spring of 1943, and protected transports in the Solomon Islands area. On 2 July 1943, she participated in the bombardment of the Vila Stanmore and Shortland Island areas in Kula Gulf, coming under the fire of enemy shore batteries. From 21 to 25 November, she pounded East Island in Empress Augusta Bay with 200 rounds of 5 inch ammunition. Sorum and Makatawa on northeast Bougainville next felt her blows, and she then proceeded north of Buka Island for an offensive sweep between Buka and Green Islands. On the morning of 20 January, she retired southward with her task unit to give fire support to the landings on Bougainville Island itself. During landings in the New Britain-New Ireland area, Renshaw dealt considerable damage to enemy airfield installations while coming under the fire of shore batteries. On 13 March the ship was in the Empress Augusta Bay area where she bombarded enemy positions in the jungles east of the beachhead held by Allied forces. After a short period of amphibious training at Pearl Harbor, Renshaw led a force of LSTs to the Marianas Islands. At first assigned to the outer destroyer screen, she later closed the Tinian beach to provide star shell illumination and fire support for troops ashore who were undergoing a heavy counterattack.  Philippines, 1944 - 1945  In November 1944, while operating with a destroyer division bombarding enemy installations in the Ormoc Bay area and conducting anti- shipping sweeps in the waters westward of Leyte, Renshaw spotted on the surface. Renshaw and accompanying destroyers , , and immediately commenced fire and, after a brief one-sided duel during which the submarine returned fire with small caliber weapons, the enemy vessel was destroyed. After a turnaround in San Pedro Bay, Renshaw and other units of her task group made a high-speed run to Ormoc Bay in an effort to intercept enemy transports reported unloading there. However, only a single Japanese vessel, a large wooden barge, was found, which Renshaw took under fire and destroyed while she came under air attack. On 31 December 1944, Renshaw sortied with a task unit en route to screen a large transport formation assigned to land troops in the Lingayen Gulf area on 9 January 1945. Despite repeated air attacks during the voyage through the Sulu and South China Seas, the powerful invasion armada reached its objective without serious damage. While in the Mindanao Sea, on 21 February 1945, Renshaw was struck by a torpedo from an enemy submarine, about 10 feet (3 m) below the waterline, flooding the firerooms. The ship lost all power, a large section of the hull was warped by the explosion, and bulkheads and decks were fractured. Even though 19 men were killed and 20 injured, within a matter of minutes, damage control parties had the flooding reduced by half. Through their efforts the main propulsion machinery suffered no damage. She managed to get under way again, and was escorted to San Pedro Bay by . President Harry S. Truman (waving his hat) with his party on board USS Renshaw during the Navy Day Fleet Review in New York Harbor, 27 October 1945. Temporary repairs were made in April by the ship's crew and men from the destroyer tender and the repair ship . Renshaw then proceeded under her own power from the forward area to the Todd Pacific Shipyard in Tacoma, Washington, where permanent repairs were completed early in October 1945. On Navy Day, 27 October 1945, in New York Harbor, President Harry S. Truman reviewed the greatest victory parade in naval history from Renshaw.  1949 - 1970  Renshaw decommissioned in February 1947 and was attached to the U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet. During 1949 and 1950, she was converted to a specialized antisubmarine vessel and recommissioned in June 1950 as DDE-499. During the Korean War, Renshaw had two tours of duty in the Far East, May to November 1951 and November 1952 to June 1953, in which she served as an escort, patrol, search and rescue, and bombardment vessel. Subsequently, Renshaw served in the Pacific Proving Grounds, February to May 1954, during Operation Castle, rendering patrol and air control services for Joint Task Force 7. This was followed by a short tour in the Far East from June to August 1954 where Renshaw rescued a British airman from the sea while acting as plane guard for the Royal Navy carrier , and also participated in a hunter-killer exercise with a force composed of United States and Canadian ships. On 8 August 1955, Renshaw sailed for her fourth tour in the Far East, spending most of her time in hunter-killer exercises and task force operations. She subsequently made additional Far Eastern deployments from Pearl Harbor, October 1956 to May 1957, December 1957 to May 1958, February 1959 to July 1959, and April 1960 to October 1960. In 1960, Renshaw received Weapon Alpha, a new anti-submarine weapon, and on 17 December 1961, recovered the nosecone of Discoverer 36. She made a further WestPac deployment in 1962. On 7 August 1962 she was redesignated a destroyer and resumed the hull number, DD-499. On 3 October, Renshaw participated in the recovery of Project Mercury astronaut Commander Walter M. Schirra. Spending most of 1963 operating out of Pearl Harbor, Renshaw deployed to WestPac again in November 1963, returning 6 months later. In 1964 Renshaw took part in the movie In Harm's Way. On 3 March 1965, Renshaw, in company with other units of Destroyer Division 252, departed Pearl Harbor on short notice to augment destroyer forces for the rapidly expanding naval commitments in the South China Sea. During April and May, she served in surveillance roles and in support of carrier striking force operations. In June she was on Taiwan patrol, returning to Vietnamese waters in July, where she remained until September before steaming via Japan for Pearl Harbor. In October and December Renshaw served as an alternate recovery ship in Project Gemini. Her 11th WestPac tour began 5 July 1966. She participated in anti- submarine operations, as an aircraft carrier rescue destroyer, in special operations with in the Tonkin Gulf, and in special operations and patrol duties in the Taiwan Strait. DesDiv 252 returned to Pearl Harbor 16 December 1966. Renshaw remained in the Hawaiian area throughout 1967. She departed Pearl Harbor 8 April 1968 for WestPac where she provided escort services for the fast carrier attack forces on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf. In September Renshaw returned to Pearl Harbor. In June 1969 she sailed for WestPac and Yankee Station where she rescued one pilot from the water. In December 1969, she returned from the Far East to Pearl Harbor. Renshaw decommissioned on 14 February 1970 and was struck from the Navy List the same day. She was sold for scrapping in October 1970 to Zidell Explorations, Inc.. Renshaw earned eight battle stars for World War II service; five battle stars for Korean War service; and six battle stars for Vietnam War service. Her Ship's Bell survives, and is at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Museum. See also See USS Renshaw for other ships of the same name.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Progressive Conservative from 1945 until his death ten years later. Argue's father, James H. Argue, was also a Member of the Legislative Assembly from 1898 to 1914. Argue was educated at Wesley College, Winnipeg. He worked as a farmer at Elgin, Manitoba and was active in freemasonry. He was married twice: first to Christina Yuill in 1911 and then to Josephine Riley in 1943. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1945 provincial election, winning by acclamation in the Deloraine constituency after his only opponent withdrew from the race. He was again returned by acclamation in the 1949 election, for the redistributed riding of Deloraine-Glenwood. From 1940 to 1950, Manitoba was governed by an alliance of Liberal-Progressives and Progressive Conservatives. When the Progressive Conservatives left the coalition in 1950, Argue chose to sit as an independent Progressive Conservative. He later rejoined the Progressive Conservative Party, and defeated Liberal-Progressive R.E. Moffat by 268 votes in the 1953 provincial election.

His coat-of-arms was \\"Enghien (gyronny of eight argent and sable crusilly or), a label gules bezantee\\". Biography Louis was the fourth son of Walter III of Enghien and Isabella of Brienne. When his mother divided the inheritance of his uncle Walter VI of Brienne among her sons, he received the title of Count of Conversano. In 1370, after Philip II of Taranto had secured the undisputed control of the Principality of Achaea against Maria of Bourbon, he was sent as Philip's bailli to the principality, which also included the lordship of Argos and Nauplia, ruled by his brother Guy. He remained in the position until 1371. From this position he and his brothers, including John of Enghien, wrote to the Doge of Venice to request Venetian aid in reclaiming the Duchy of Athens, which had been in their family's hands until 1311, from the Catalan Company, but help was not forthcoming. On the death of his childless nephew Walter V of Enghien in 1381, he also became titular Duke of Athens, Count of Brienne and Lord of Enghien. He married Giovanna of Sanseverino, and they had four daughters: Margaret, Yolanda, Isabella, and Helena. On his death, at Conversano, on March 17, 1394, his titles were inherited by his eldest daughter * Margaret (born 1365). In 1380, Margaret married John of Luxembourg, Lord of Beauvoir (1370‚Äì1397), son of Guy of Luxembourg and Mahaut of Ch√¢tillon, by whom she had issue, including  Peter I of Luxembourg, Count of St. Pol, of Brienne and of Conversano, and  John II of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny. Peter I married in his own turn, Margaret de Baux, by whom he had nine children: among them are Louis, Count of St. Pol, Brienne, and Conversano, and Jacquetta (mother of Queen consort Elizabeth Woodville). Louis was one of the founding members of the Order of the Ship of King Charles III (1381).

Graduates earn either the International Baccalaureate (\\"IB\\") or the French Baccalaureate (\\"French Bac\\"). The IB curriculum is taught in English, while the French Bac is taught in French. A common misconception is that French is required to attend IHS. This is not true. Non-French speakers follow the IB curriculum. Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of the students graduate with the IB diploma. (The IB is an internationally recognized degree program, with the fastest growth coming in the United States. Stuart Hall/Convent in San Francisco and Berkeley High School are two schools in the Bay Area that also offer the IB diploma.) IB and French Bac graduates earn substantial college credit from pursuing these programs. Many graduates attend respected universities. At IHS, for example, 61 out of 239 graduates (37%) in the last three graduating classes (2015-17) matriculated at University of Chicago (10), UC Berkeley (9), NYU (8), Carnegie Mellon (7), Stanford (6), UCLA (6), King's College London (5), St. Andrews (4), Harvard (3), Columbia (3), Cornell (3), Washington University (3), Johns Hopkins (3), Georgetown (3), MIT (2), Brown (2), Williams (2), Penn (2), University College London (2), Carleton (2), Davidson, Emory, London School of Economics, and Wellesley. The IHS faculty is recruited from all over the world and represents over 20 nationalities. The average number of years of teaching experience is just under 20, and more than 80% of the faculty hold master's degrees or higher. The Main Campus at 150 Oak St. The Arts Pavilion at 66 Page St. Campus International High School's campus consists of a main building at 150 Oak St., a gymnasium and outdoor recreational space across the street, and an Arts Pavilion on 66 Page St. The school has acquired the lots at 98 Franklin and 84 Page and is currently in the process of selecting designs for the development of an expanded urban campus. The main building at Oak Street houses classrooms and science labs, teacher workrooms, administrative offices, the library, the design lab, as well as the rooftop deck. The Arts Pavilion houses the music, film, visual arts, and theater programs. The lower floors of the main building house Chinese American International School and French American International School, both K-8 schools. Student body Each entering class at International is composed of 90-100 students. In the past few years, there have been around 250 applications for the approximately 50 open spots in the entering freshman class. (The remaining 40-50 students that made up the entering class came from the affiliated French-American K-8 school.) Incoming students arrive at IHS from the following middle schools in the Bay Area, among others: a) Independent schools: Presidio Hill, SF Day, Hamlin, Live Oak, Town, Burke, Friends, Adda Clevenger, Children's Day, Marin Country Day, Head Royce (Oakland), Redwood Day (Oakland), Bentley (Oakland) b) Parochial/Religious schools: Cathedral, Stuart Hall, Convent, Brandeis, Zion Lutheran, St. Thomas More, Notre Dame des Victoires, St. Paul Episcopal, Holy Spirit c) Bilingual schools: Chinese American International School, Ecole Bilingue de Berkeley, Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de San Francisco, International School of the Peninsula d) Public schools: Alice Fong Yu, Aptos, Everett, Gateway, Hoover, Kipp Bridge, Lawton, Presidio, Rooftop, Mill Valley Middle, Crocker Middle (Hillsborough) Ingrid Lacy (Pacifica), Fernando Rivera (Daly City) A small number of students enter from schools abroad. Over 30% of the families receive financial aid. Languages The school offers extensive language offerings in French, Chinese, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic. Students are able to take native level classes in French and Chinese (and Spanish if there is sufficient demand) beginning in their freshman year. During the IB years in 11th and 12th grade, the school offers both Level A (native/bilingual level) and Level B (non-native) courses in French and Chinese. (The school offers Level A in Spanish when there is sufficient demand.) Spanish, Italian and Arabic are offered at Level B (non-native) level in the IB years.http://www.internationalsf.org/page.cfm?p=3094 All students take a minimum of four years of a language other than English; many take a third language as well. All of the language teachers are native in the tongue that they teach. Global travel International High School's students make yearly cultural, service oriented, and linguistic trips to multiple destinations across the world. The extensive travel program at IHS is unique in the Bay Area. In 2017-18, groups of 10-20 students from grades 9 to 11 will travel to Vietnam, China and Tibet, Denmark and Germany, the American South, England, Ecuador, Galapagos Islands, Tahiti, Senegal, Thailand, and India and Myanmar for approximately two weeks. The school also offers longer 6 to 8 week exchanges intended to enhance the students‚Äô globally focused education outside the classroom and enrich their linguistic proficiency. The trips often consist of exchange programs in which IHS students are hosted by local families in the foreign country. In 2015-16, IHS students had the opportunity to undertake exchanges in France (Paris, Bordeaux, Tahiti), Spain, Bolivia, and Peru. In return, IHS families host students from the various foreign countries in their homes in San Francisco. Service learning Service learning is an integral part of the curriculum at International as it is a core component of the IB diploma program. Students perform at least 100 hours of service activities throughout their years at IHS. The service component culminates with a month long Creativity Action Service project fully organized by each student. Examples of CAS projects in the past have been: an annual student-run TEDx program, a student organized community development project in Nicaragua, a fundraising evening of music and food for the Chigoli organization in Malawi, a student-organized and run summer volleyball class for girls at John Muir Elementary, a student founded and led LGBT club (\\"LASER\\") to raise consciousness about LGBT issues, among many others. The school partners with an extensive list of non-profit organizations that the students regularly become engaged with, including Amigos de las Americas, Breakthrough San Francisco, Family House, Habitat for Humanity, John Muir Elementary After School Beacon Program, My Yute Soccer, Reading Partners, Rocket Dog Rescue, and Teens Teaching Elders Technology, among others. The student body is also active in annual blood drives for Blood Centers of the Pacific, day-long volunteer efforts at the S.F. Food Bank,http://www.sffoodbank.org/Home/index.html and others. IHS is also known for its international community service projects, most prominently raising money to build schools in Jemjem Legabatu, Ethiopia, and M'bour, Senegal. Each year, students at International organize an evening of musical performances by students and faculty known as Songs for Senegal to raise funds to support √âcole Natangu√© in Senegal. IHS has had a key role in the construction and growth of √âcole Natangu√©. Athletics International sponsors twenty athletic teams that compete with other high schools throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. As of 2017-18, the school competes in the BCL Central league in team sports. Scott Kennedy joined the school as Athletic Director in 2015-16, after 16 years at Mission High School. Scott is the recipient of several leadership and coaching awards, including the California State Athletic Directors Association \\"Athletic Director of the Year\\" Award and the Positive Coaching Alliance \\"National Double-Goal Coach\\" Award. The athletic program at IHS consists of eleven different sports at the Varsity and Junior Varsity levels (including two clubs sports - sailing and skiing) and around 55 percent of the student body participates in athletics throughout the academic year. The sports are as follows: Fall: co-ed cross country (varsity and JV), men's soccer (varsity and JV), women's tennis (varsity and JV), women's volleyball (varsity and JV), sailing (varsity and JV) Winter: men's basketball (varsity and JV), women's basketball (varsity and JV) Spring: co-ed badminton (varsity), co-ed swimming (varsity), co-ed track (varsity), men's baseball (varsity), men's tennis (varsity and JV), women's soccer (varsity) Notable results: In Fall 2017, the men's soccer team went the North Coast Section (NCS) playoff tournament and earned a quarter-finals slot. In 2016-17, IHS attained the following additional results in BCL league play: first in men's and women's basketball; first in baseball; and second in badminton; third in women's volleyball; third in men's tennis. The women's varsity soccer team reached the finals of the NCS playoff tournament. The women's basketball team made it to the CIF State tournament in 2016-17. Arts Students at International have the option of taking art - whether it be music, theater, visual arts, or film - in each of their four years. In 9th grade, students explore two art forms, one each semester. In 10th grade, each student chooses one art form for a deeper exploration lasting the entire year. In 11th grade, students can choose to continue with a two-year art course as part of the IB Diploma. This IB art course is a rigorous exploration at the same level of depth and commitment as any of the other five IB courses taken by each student. (The five other IB courses fall in the following categories: English Literature, Mathematics, Science, Humanities/Social Science, and a Second Language other than English.) Thus, many students take art for four years at International. (If a student does not choose the art course, the \\"sixth course\\" as it is known can be in any of the other academic disciplines, e.g., a second Science course or a second Humanities course.) International opened the Dennis Gallagher Arts Pavilion in September 2009. The Pavilion includes a black-box theater, a state-of-the-art film and video editing classroom, as well as music and visual arts studios. Student engage in a broad range of artistic activities and classes there: from writing and directing one act plays to making short films, from painting murals to composing music. The arts are not limited to classes during the regular school day. The Visual Arts department puts on exhibitions throughout the year, with the work of the IB visual arts students prominently on display at the March Arts Reception and at the end-of-year May Arts Festival. The after school performing arts program includes theater and music. = Theater = The school's after school theater program is known as Back √† Dos and it is the heart of the performing arts at IHS. The program enjoys the largest participation of any school sponsored extra-curricular activity other than athletics. Every year, Back √† Dos produces at least three major shows, including a set of student-directed one act plays (many of which are original student-written pieces), a musical with live musical accompaniment by IHS musicians, and a play. Past performances include Spamalot, Cabaret, and Spring Awakening. = Music = The after school music program holds auditions at the beginning of the year for the ensemble that performs during the Spring Musical. Rehearsals take place twice a week after school from January until the end of the musical, usually in mid to late March. Student-musicians also participate in the IHS orchestra, which rehearses twice a week after school in the fall culminating in a recital at the Florence Gould Theater in the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. There are several major music concerts during the year - Songs of Senegal (in the Fall and used as a fundraiser for an IHS backed school in Senegal, consists mostly of small group pop/rock, jazz, and vocal performances), the Florence Gould Recital (for chamber, jazz, and acoustic performances in January), and two Rock/Pop/Jazz Concerts (in January and May).  Design Technology  The school offers Design Technology courses beginning in the freshman year (required for all entering students) and continuing in 10th and in the IB years (11th and 12th) as an optional elective. The freshman course includes a coding component taught by a computer science teacher. The IB Design Technology course incorporates elements of physics, engineering, and art and design. The school partners with SF's Tech Shop in offering its IB design courses and participates in the Maker Faire in San Mateo.

It is now part of BAE Systems Electronics & Integrated Solutions, a subsidiary of BAE Systems. It concentrated on developing and manufacturing electronic systems, notably aircraft self-protection systems, and tactical surveillance and intelligence systems. Other business areas included microwave, missile and space electronics; infrared imaging; and automated mission planning systems, with both military and commercial applications. The first home video game console was developed as a side project by engineer Ralph H. Baer and several assistants at Sanders. The production of the final product was granted to Magnavox, a home electronics company, and sold under the name Magnavox Odyssey.  History  The company was founded in Waltham, Massachusetts in July 1951, formed by eleven engineers and scientists from Raytheon. It was named for Royden C. Sanders, Jr., one of the original eleven associates. It moved its operations to Nashua in 1952, taking up a vacant mill building and restoring economic vitality to a city that had been devastated by the post- World War II departure of the textile industry from New England to the lower- cost American South.NHBR obituary for Mort Goulder, Sanders co-founder Sanders Associates was one of the premier flexible printed circuit manufacturers during the 1960s and 1970s. It specialized in complex flexible circuit assemblies and specialized printed wiring boards for both the U.S. military and space programs including the Saturn V and Lunar Excursion Module. Sanders also produced flexible circuity for most other commercial applications including medical equipment. Sanders Flexprint division was involved with producing printed wiring boards and flex circuitry for all branches of the military and for all platforms. The Flexprint division was sold in the late seventies or early eighties. Most divisions of Sanders Associates competed in the government marketplace. One division marketed intelligent terminals to the commercial marketplace. These intelligent terminals competed against IBM 3270 terminals, Honeywell terminals, Univac Uniscope terminals and Burroughs Corporation terminals. Terminals provided data entry capability into mainframes as well as light pen pointing and selection before the mouse was in use. The last Sanders Intelligent terminal system marketed was the 814 terminal controller that supported up to eight terminals. That division was acquired by Harris Corporation in the late 1970s and integrated with their Data Communications Division. For a short time, the Nashua plant facilities were shared between Sanders and Harris, eventually the Harris division was moved to a new facility in Dallas, Texas. In 1986, Sanders Associates was bought by Lockheed Corporation and became Sanders, A Lockheed Company. Following the Lockheed/Martin Marietta merger in 1995, Sanders was merged into Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems. In July 2000, Lockheed announced the sale of this group to BAE Systems for $1.67 billion. The company became BAE Systems Information & Electronic Warfare Systems (IEWS). In 2005, this was merged into the newly created BAE Systems Electronics & Integrated Solutions.  Video games  The first home video game console was developed at Sanders by a team headed by Ralph Baer in 1966. It became the Magnavox Odyssey.

His highest rank was ≈çzeki, which he held for fifty tournaments. As an active rikishi he was extremely popular and was nicknamed the \\"Prince of Sumo\\" due to his good looks and relatively slim build. He was the father of Wakanohana Masaru and Takanohana K≈çji, and as head of the Futagoyama stable coached both of them to the yokozuna rank. Career He had been a champion swimmer while at school, but did not think he could make a living out of it. He was determined to join professional sumo, in spite of some opposition from his family, who had wanted him to continue swimming (he was considered a possibility to make the team for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City). He began his career in the spring of 1965, joining Futagoyama stable which had been set up his elder brother, former yokozuna Wakanohana Kanji I, three years previously. He initially fought under his own surname of Hanada. He reached the top makuuchi division in November 1968 at the age of just 18, the youngest ever at the time (the record is now held by his son Takanohana). He weighed barely 100 kg, and would remain one of the lightest men in the top division for the rest of his career. He adopted the shikona of Takanohana in 1969. He was the last man to beat yokozuna Taih≈ç, in May 1971. As he rose up the rankings he collected nine special prizes, including four prestigious Gin≈ç-sh≈ç, or Technique Awards. After finishing as runner-up in consecutive tournaments in May and July 1972 he reached sumo's second highest rank of ≈çzeki in November 1972. He was promoted at the same time as his friend and rival Wajima, who quickly went on to be promoted to yokozuna. Takanohana's progress was slower, but he did win two top division tournament (or honbasho) championships in March and September 1975, each time delighting the crowds by defeating the giant yokozuna Kitanoumi in a playoff. He and Wakanohana were the first brothers ever to each win a top division tournament title. He was also runner-up in the January and March 1977 tournaments. However he was ultimately unable to defeat Kitanoumi or Wajima on a regular basis, and was hampered by his inability to put on weight, and so never made the yokozuna rank. Nevertheless, he was an ≈çzeki for fifty tournaments, corresponding to over eight years in the rank. This was a record until July 2007 when it was broken by Chiyotaikai. He was a bigger crowd attraction than some yokozuna. By the early 1980s he was finding it harder to hold onto his rank, and had been overtaken by his stablemate Wakanohana Kanji II, and other younger wrestlers. One of his final bouts was a memorable clash in September 1980 with Hawaiian born Takamiyama, who was nearly twice his weight and like Takanohana, extremely popular with the Japanese public. Takanohana looked to have won the match with an underarm throw, only for the judges to reverse the referee's decision and rule that the tip of Takanohana's topknot or oichomage had brushed the surface of the dohyo ahead of his opponent. After losing to the rising star Chiyonofuji twice in a row in September and November 1980, he decided the time was right to retire. The two were often compared, and Takanohana had been something of a mentor to Chiyonofuji, advising him to give up smoking to help increase his weight, something that Takanohana himself had never been able to manage. After retirement After retiring from sumo in January 1981, he took the name Fujishima and established the Fujishima stable in 1982, which grew to be one of the most powerful in terms of top makuuchi ranked wrestlers. When his elder brother retired as a stablemaster in 1993 he purchased the Futagoyama toshiyori-kabu or elder stock, with the help of 300 million yen from his koenkai, or network of supporters. The two stables merged, and the newly renamed Futagoyama stable had one quarter of all the top ranked rikishi in it at one point, including two yokozuna, an ≈çzeki and many others regularly in the junior san'yaku ranks. During this time it was undoubtedly the most powerful stable the sumo world has seen in the postwar period. He oversaw the promotion of both of his sons to yokozuna, the first time ever that two siblings have held sumo's highest rank. He was married in 1970 to a former actress and beauty queen, Fujita Noriko, who was once \\"Miss ≈åita Prefecture\\". They were divorced in 2001. His health began to decline in 2003, and he withdrew from his duties in the Sumo Association. He passed on control of Futagoyama stable to his son Takanohana in January 2004, and made his last public appearance in January 2005 at the retirement ceremony of one of his former wrestlers, Takanonami. Death Takanohana's grave in Suginami, Tokyo. In February 2005, his son publicly announced that his father was struggling with mouth cancer (he had been a heavy smoker of Mild Seven cigarettes for most of his life). He underwent extensive treatment, but no recovery was possible, and on 30 May 2005, he succumbed to the disease at the age of 55. There was an acrimonious battle between Takanohana's sons over who should be head mourner at his funeral. More than 1200 attended the event, which was held in Aoyama, Minato, Tokyo. The Sumo Association also held a public funeral in the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on June 13. This was the first time in nine years that a former wrestler had been afforded this honour. Fighting style Takanohana's favoured techniques were hidari-yotsu (a right hand outside, left hand inside grip on his opponent's mawashi), tsuridashi (lift out) and uwatenage (overarm throw). He was also noted for his ability to spin at the edge of the ring and turn the tables on his opponent with the utchari throw.

Hill was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the first round (13th overall) of the 2003 MLB draft and made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with them in 2005. He also played for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Milwaukee Brewers, Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants. Hill is one of only five players in MLB history to hit for the cycle twice in one season. Early life At age 15, Hill and friends were participating in a soccer tournament in Park City, Utah. While on their way to a round of golf, a college student narrowly missed Hill's car and slammed into his mother's car following behind him. Hill's mother, Vicki, was killed as a result. College career Hill was originally drafted by the Anaheim Angels in the 7th round of the June 2000 Draft. Hill turned down the offer, opting to attend Louisiana State University and play for the varsity Tigers baseball team. While at LSU, Hill posted a career .335 batting average with 23 home runs and 150 RBIs. In 2001, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named playoff MVP of Wareham's league championship team. Professional Career =Toronto Blue Jays= Hill was Toronto's first draft pick (13th overall) in the 2003 MLB draft, and he made his major league debut on May 20, 2005, after being called up from the minor leagues a day earlier as an injury replacement for Corey Koskie. Although he was brought up as a shortstop, Hill appeared as a third baseman, a designated hitter, and as a second baseman during the course of the season. He finished the 2005 season with a .274 batting average, .348 OBP, and 25 doubles in 361 at-bats. After the trade of Orlando Hudson to the Arizona Diamondbacks, Hill became the starting second baseman for the Blue Jays in 2006, but was moved back to shortstop mid-season after the demotion of Russ Adams. After experiencing defensive struggles at shortstop, he was then moved back to second base, with John McDonald taking over at shortstop. On May 29, 2007, in a game at home against the New York Yankees with Andy Pettitte pitching, Hill became only the second player in Blue Jays history to accomplish a \\"straight steal\\" of home. Hill won a Fielding Bible Award at second base for his fielding excellence in 2007. On April 4, 2008, Hill agreed to a four-year, $12 million deal that included a club option that could have run through the 2014 season. The contract would have been worth as much as $38 million if Toronto kept Hill in the fold for all seven years of the deal. On May 29, Hill suffered a Grade II concussion in a collision with teammate David Eckstein during a game against the Oakland Athletics. Hill missed the remainder of the season. Hill returned from his concussion during spring training. On July 5, 2009, Hill was selected by managers and players to take part in the 2009 MLB All-Star Game in St. Louis. Hill finished the 2009 season with 37 doubles, 36 home runs, 108 runs batted in, and a batting average of .286. After the season, Hill received the 2009 AL Comeback Player of the Year. He was voted the Blue Jays Player of the Year. He was also honored with his second Fielding Bible Award. Prior to the first game of the 2011 season, the Blue Jays announced that they had declined the three option years on Hill's contract. Hill was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 24, retroactive to April 20, with a strained hamstring. =Arizona Diamondbacks= Hill with the Arizona Diamondbacks On August 23, 2011, Hill and John McDonald were traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for second baseman Kelly Johnson. Hill hit his first home run as a Diamondback on August 28 against the San Diego Padres, a two-run shot to right field off starter Cory Luebke. In Game 4 of the 2011 NLDS, Hill hit his first postseason home run. The Diamondbacks would, however, lose the division series to the Milwaukee Brewers in 5 games. After the 2011 season, the Diamondbacks resigned Hill to a 2-year, $11 million contract extension. On April 7, 2012, Hill, who got moved up in the order to the #2 spot, went 2-4 with 3 RBI and 2 home runs against the Giants in the 1st and 2nd innings, both off of Madison Bumgarner. This came after going 0-4 on Opening Day while hitting 8th. The D-Backs went on to win 5-4. On June 18, 2012, Hill hit for the cycle against the Seattle Mariners. On June 29, 2012, Hill again hit for the cycle against the Milwaukee Brewers, becoming the first player to hit for the cycle twice in one season since Babe Herman in 1931 for the Brooklyn Robins and the first modern-era player to do so in the same month (John Reilly hit cycles a week apart in 1883). =Milwaukee Brewers= On January 30, 2016, Hill was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along with Chase Anderson, Isan Diaz, and cash considerations for Jean Segura and Tyler Wagner. On May 7, 2016, Hill had a career day at the plate hitting three home runs and driving in seven runs. His home runs included a game-tying home run in the eighth inning and a go-ahead grand slam in the tenth inning. Hill had only hit three home runs in his previous 82 games at the time. =Boston Red Sox= On July 7, 2016, the Brewers traded Hill to the Boston Red Sox for Aaron Wilkerson and Wendell Rijo. =San Francisco Giants= On February 17, 2017, Hill signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. Through 80 plate appearances, Hill managed just a .132 batting average with a strikeout to walk ratio of 13/11. He was designated for assignment on June 24 and released 6 days later.

It is among the laconic phrases reported by Plutarch,Plutarch, Moralia 225D, \\"Sayings of Spartans\\", Leonidas, Son of Anasandridas, saying 11 original Greek in the Perseus Project attributed to King Leonidas I in reply to the demand by Xerxes I that the Spartans surrender their weapons.  Grammar  The phrase ŒºŒøŒª·ΩºŒΩ ŒªŒ±Œ≤Œ≠ mol·πën lab√© is in the Classical Greek of Plutarch and does not necessarily reflect the Doric dialect that Leonidas would have used.The form ·ºîŒºŒøŒªŒøŒΩ is recorded in Doric as the aorist for Œµ·º∑œÅœÄŒøŒΩ \\"to go, come\\". in Liddell & Scott, A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon (1940). The classical pronunciation is , the modern pronunciation . At the time of Plutarch, when the phrase was recorded, the pronunciation would have been somewhere between the classical and the modern, approximately . The phrase is participial, its literal translation would be approximately \\"having come, take!\\". This use of the participle is known as the circumstantial participle in the grammar of classical Greek, i.e. the participle gives a circumstance (the coming) attendant on the main verb (the taking).Alston Hurd Chase and Henry Phillips Jr., A New Introduction to Greek (), Lesson 21. It is a form of hypotaxis, where English would use parataxis, the conjunction of two verbs, \\"come and take\\". This construction normally (but not always) occurs within narrative literature.Daniel Wallace, Greek Grammar beyond the Basics [Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1996], 640‚Äì45). The first word, ' (\\"having come\\") is the aorist active participle (masculine, nominative, singular) of the Greek verb ' \\"to come\\". at Liddell & Scott, A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon (1940). The aorist stem is ŒºŒøŒª- (the present stem in Œ≤Œªœé- being the regular reflex of ŒºŒªœé-, from a verbal root reconstructed as *mel…ô-, *ml≈ç- \\"to appear\\"Pokorny (1959), p. 721f.). The aorist participle is used in cases where an action has been completed, also called the perfective aspect. This is a nuance indicating that the first action (the coming) must precede the second (the taking). The second word, , is the second person singular imperative of \\"take; grasp, seize\\". The entire phrase is thus in the singular, i.e. Leonidas is depicted as addressing Xerxes personally, not the Persian army as a group.  Origin  Plutarch cites the phrase in his Apophthegmata Laconica (\\"Sayings of Spartans\\"). The exchange between Leonidas and Xerxes occurs in writing, on the eve of the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC): : :\\"When Xerxes wrote again, ‚ÄòHand over your arms,‚Äô he wrote in reply, ‚ÄòCome and take them.‚Äô\\" (trans. Frank Cole Babbitt, 1931) The exchange is cited in a collection of sayings by Leonidas before the Battle of Thermopylae (51.2-15). The main source for the events of the battle is Herodotus. According to his account, the Spartans held Thermopylae for three days, and although ultimately defeated, they inflicted serious damage on the Persian army. Most importantly, this delayed the Persians' progress to Athens, providing sufficient time for the city's evacuation to the island of Salamis. Though a tactical defeat, Thermopylae served as a strategic and moral victory, inspiring the Greek forces to defeat the Persians at the Battle of Salamis later the same year and the Battle of Plataea one year later.  Modern use  =Greece= Modern use of as a military motto appears to originate in the Kingdom of Greece during World War I or the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922).Œó ŒîŒØŒ∫Œ∑ œÑœâŒΩ ŒïŒæ (œÑŒ± ŒµœÉœÑŒµŒΩŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ± œÄœÅŒ±Œ∫œÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨) (Trial of the Six official transcript), Œ†œÅœâŒØŒ± newspaper (1922), p. 213. The motto is on the emblem of the I Army Corps of Greece and the Second Infantry Division of Cyprus. The phrase was inscribed on the Thermopylae monument (1955), using an archaic script that would be appropriate for the time of the Persian Wars. During the Cyprus Emergency, fought between Greek Cypriot insurgents and British troops, Cypriot leader Grigoris Afxentiou on 3 March 1957 was surrounded by British forces outside his secret hideout near the Machairas Monastery near Lazanias, Nicosia.Grivas Memoirs (1964), p. 111 The British asked Afxentiou to surrender his arms but he replied with molon labe. Unable to drive him out and after sustaining casualties, the British forces resorted to pouring petrol into his hideout and lighting it, burning him alive.Charles Foley (ed.), The Memoirs of General Grivas, Longmans, London (1964), p. 111. =United States= Allusion to the phrase in translation (\\"come and take it!\\") is recorded in the context of the American revolution, noted in 1778 at Fort Morris in the Province of Georgia, and later in 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales during the Texas Revolution where it became a prevalent slogan. Use of the original Greek in the United States is more recent. Its use by militia organizations is reported for the 1990s or early 2000s,Scott Barry, \\"A Series of Documents\\" (2003), p. 78 and use by the Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT) is recorded for 2006.See the top of the page for the two logos and their motto usage. Texas Revolution Gonzales flag at the Texas State Capitol In early January 1831, prior to the Texan Revolution, Green DeWitt wrote to Ram√≥n M√∫squiz, the top political official of Bexar, and requested armament for defense of the colony of Gonzales. This request was granted by delivery of a small used cannon. The small bronze cannon was received by the colony and signed for on March 10, 1831, by James Tumlinson, Jr. The swivel cannon was mounted to a blockhouse in Gonzales and later was the object of Texan pride. At the minor skirmish known as the Battle of Gonzales ‚Äî the first battle of the revolution against Mexican rule ‚Äî a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders from Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase \\"come and take it\\" along with a black star and an image of the cannon that they had received four years earlier from Mexican officials. This was the same message that was sent to the Mexican government when they told the Texans to return the cannon; lack of compliance with the initial demands led to the failed attempt by the Mexican military to take the cannon back forcibly. Replicas of the original flag can be seen in the Texas State Capitol, the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum, the Sam Houston State University CJ Center, the University of Texas at El Paso Library, the Marine Military Academy headquarters building, Hoblitzelle Auditorium of the Hockaday School, and in Perkins Library at Duke University. Gun rights activism In the United States, the original Greek phrase and its English translation are often heard as a defense of the right to keep and bear arms and opposition to gun control legislation.

Umbels can be simple or compound. The secondary umbels of compound umbels are known as umbellules or umbellets. A small umbel is called an umbellule. The arrangement of the inflorescence in umbels is referred to as umbellate, or occasionally subumbellate (almost umbellate). Umbels are a characteristic of plants such as carrot, parsley, dill, and fennel in the family Apiaceae; ivy, Aralia and Fatsia in the family Araliaceae; onion (Allium) in the family Alliaceae.

The fruit, a cross between a grapefruit and an orange, had spontaneously appeared in the shade-providing trees grown on coffee plantations in the Puerto Rican highlands. In 1956, Carlos G. Moscoso, from the Horticulture, Agricultural Extension Service of the University of Puerto Rico noticed trees that grew fruits that were larger and a brighter yellow than those of the other trees on the plantations. Rootstock trials led to the development of the hybrid commonly known as the chironja. In Puerto Rican Spanish, the name is a portmanteau of orange (Puerto Rican Spanish: china) and grapefruit (toronja).

The distinction between \\"organized\\" and \\"disorganized\\" offenders was drawn by the American criminologist Roy Hazelwood. The disorganized offender is usually of low-average or below average intelligence. They often have poor work ethic and are apt to be regularly fired from or reprimanded at work; in the cases where a disorganized offender has a steady work ethic, they work blue collar jobs or jobs which require little or no use of reasoning or intelligence. They are socially inadequate and possess little or no interpersonal skills; most disorganized offenders have never been married or in a serious relationship. Although a disorganized offender may claim to be heterosexual, evidence will usually suggest that they are either a virgin or that their sexual conquests have come in relation to a paraphilia, such as necrophilia, bestiality, or pedophilia. Some disorganized offenders have exhibited homosexual tendencies, but in such cases, any homosexual contact they may have had will usually be either as a symbolic act of dominance or as an offshoot of one of their paraphilias. Disorganized offenders have an innate fear or anxiety in regard to people, especially strangers, and usually live in a complex delusion that they have constructed in their own mind. Ed Gein, for example, exhumed the corpses of women who he believed reminded him of his mother and consumed parts of them because he believed that he could preserve his mother's soul inside of his own body, going so far as to create a \\"female suit\\" made of human flesh that he would wear when assuming his mother's identity. Disorganized offenders, lacking confidence and the skills that the planning of a crime requires, do not venture far from their homes when committing murders. Their victims are either chosen at random or are people they know personally. The murder is sadistic; the disorganized offender uses overkill. A disorganized offender may stab his victim dozens of times even after he or she is dead.

Based in Ljubljana, it has regional broadcasting centres in Koper and Maribor and correspondents around Slovenia, Europe, and the world. RTV Slovenija's national radio services operate under the name , while the television division carries the name or . The names are sometimes Anglicized as Radio Slovenia and TV Slovenia, respectively. There are three national and four regional radio services, which can all be heard online as well. RTV Slovenija also finances the RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra and the RTV Slovenia Big Band. The legal foundation for the institution is the Radiotelevizija Slovenija Act (). It is the only public nonprofit broadcasting organization in Slovenia to operate both radio and television stations. The law also requires it to air radio and television services for the country's two indigenous linguistic minorities, which it does in collaboration with the regional broadcasting centres in Maribor (for the Hungarian-speaking minority) and in Koper (for the Italian- speaking minority). Approximately 73% of RTV Slovenija's funding comes from television licence fees. History Radio Ljubljana signed on the air for the first time on September 1, 1928, with experimental broadcasts. By October 28 the radio station already had a scheduled programme. On April 11, 1941, the station's transmitter in Dom≈æale was destroyed and the station was occupied by Italy. TV Ljubljana's first broadcast for Eurovision in 1960 On April 1, 1949, the first TV laboratory was established in Ljubljana, but was separate from the radio station. However, the task of setting up a television service was eventually assigned to Radio Ljubljana. Second radio program started in 1951. On November 11, 1958 the TV channel got a regular schedule, but it was shared by other Yugoslav republics, with TV Ljubljana getting around 30% of airtime. TV Ljubljana produced its first broadcast for Eurovision, showing ski jumping in Planica, in 1960. The color program broadcasting started in 1966. During that decade, the amount of programming produced exclusively for Slovenian audiences increased substantially. On April 15, 1968, the main evening newscast was broadcast in the Slovenian language for the first time. It had previously originated in Belgrade and was produced in Serbo-Croatian. In 1970, the RTV Slovenia record label was established. In 1971, TV Koper/Capodistria, a subsidiary of RTV Ljubljana, was launched as the first bilingual TV station in Slovenia, serving the Italian community in Slovenia and Croatia. However, it enjoyed huge popularity in many parts of Italy. There, RAI still had a monopoly on television, so many Italians eagerly tuned into the new Yugoslav station, which broadcast mostly in color. Private companies built transmitters and translators in various parts of Italy that made TV Koper-Capodistria (generally known as \\"Telecapodistria\\" in Italy) available to millions of Italians. Because the station used the PAL color standard, Italians bought PAL TV sets in large numbers, ending the hopes of the French government that Italy might adopt its SECAM system instead. With the advent of privately owned, purely commercial television in Italy, the station's popularity eventually began to diminish. During the 1970s, TV Ljubljana's main service was also gradually converted to color. In 1984, teletext was introduced, whereas the digitalization started in 1986. In 1989, Radio Ljubljana started transmitting an RDS signal. At first, TV Ljubljana's second television network primarily relayed programs from other Yugoslav television stations. In the late 1980s, however, the percentage of TV Ljubljana's own programs on the second network increased dramatically. A year before Slovenia's independence in 1991, the institution was renamed to Radiotelevizija Slovenija (from RTV Ljubljana). On January 1, 1993, RTV Slovenija was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union following the collapse of Yugoslavia, and began participation in the Eurovision Song Contest. In the mid- to late 1990s, TV Slovenia began to face increased competition from Slovenia's commercial television stations. In 1995, RTV Slovenija published its first web page. Radio digitalization started in 1995, whereas the digitalization of television broadcasting started in 1999. In 1997, satellite broadcasting started via Hot Bird 3. In 2001, RTV Slovenija's Multimedia Centre was established to help introduce new technologies. A new multimedia web portal was introduced in 2002. This portal includes regular news updates, broadcast archives, and the live transmission on line of most services, both radio and television. RSS feeds were introduced in 2005. The public broadcaster referendum, 2005 was approved by a slight majority of voters, but the referendum saw a very low turnout. On November 12, 2005 a law was passed stating that Radio-television Slovenia is \\"a public institution of special cultural and national importance...\\" In May 2008 TV Slovenia began airing a new TV channel, TV Slovenija 3, dedicated primarily to live Parliament coverage. In August 2008 TV Slovenia broadcast their first HD event ‚Äì Olympic Games 2008 on test DVB-T channel. The Slovenian public broadcaster law referendum, 2010 was rejected by voters. In 2011, analogue signal was abandoned. http://dk.fdv.uni- lj.si/diplomska/pdfs/oblak-sara.pdf http://www.rtvslo.si/strani/zgodovina-rtv- slovenija/14  Legal framework  The 1994 Law on RTV Slovenia regulates public broadcasting. RTV Slovenia has a Programming Council and a Supervisory Board; RTV is required by law to be independent and autonomous, to respect human integrity and dignity in its programs, to observe the principle of impartiality, and to ensure the truthfulness of information and the pluralism of opinions and religious beliefs. The law also requires the public broadcaster to provide radio and TV programs for the Italian and Hungarian minorities in Slovenia. Marko Milosavljeviƒá and Igor Vobiƒç, Slovenia #National Media Policies, EJC Press Landscapes (circa 2009) After EU accession, the new 2005 Law on RTV Slovenia reintroduced a dominant role of the state and the executive in the appointment of RTV's governing bodies, excluding civil society institutions (e.g. universities, association of writers, and sports organisations) which were previously involved. The draft law raised several domestic and international criticisms, including from the International Federation of Journalists and the Council of Europe, but the Slovenian institutions dismissed most of themthe Slovenian government refused to accept any important changes, refused the opinion of the Council of Europe as ‚Äúlegally incorrect, wrong and politologically missed from the start‚Äù, while Karol Jakubowicz, the chairman of the Steering Committee on the Media and New Communications Services of the Council of Europe, who said that the draft law is ‚Äúa catastrophe‚Äù, was labeled by Slovenian Ministry for Culture as ‚Äúa third- rate public servant from Poland‚Äù. and went along with adopting the new law in November 2005, which was later narrowly confirmed by 50.7% of voters in a special referendum. The current governance system of RTV Slovenia allows control over almost all managerial bodies and over the appointment of all key editors to the governmental majority. Majority parties also control the majority of the new Programming Council and Supervisory Board of RTVS, thus being also able to appoint RTVS' Director General, who will in turn appoint and manage the directors of radio and TV, the editors-in-chief, and the senior management. This governance system is deemed a threat to the independence and credibility, trust, and respect with the public of RTV Slovenia by the European Journalism Centre. The following period indeed saw a host of cases of political interference in the editorial and journalistic work of the Slovenian public broadcaster, whose public credibility (particularly for the TV) fell dramatically. The Varuh pravic poslu≈°alcev in gledalcev (‚ÄúListener and Viewer Ombudsman‚Äù) of RTV Slovenia was appointed for the first time in 2008, according to art.16 of the RTV Slovenia Law, to \\"address the comments and suggestions of viewers and listeners\\" and \\"give instructions to the director- general regarding changes that must be effected on channels.‚Äù Radio services =National= RTV Slovenija's national radio networks are based in Ljubljana and broadcast in Slovene.

Background Mitre is of Mexican American descent. He grew up in Tijuana, Mexico, where he trained in the arts of kenpo, boxing and wrestling due to frequent street fights. Mitre graduated from Montgomery High School in San Diego, California in June 1999. He and his wife, Tonya, have a son named Sam (Sergio Armando Mitre III), who was born on December 29, 2006. They also have a young daughter named Senya. Pro career =Chicago Cubs= Mitre was the Chicago Cubs 7th-round selection in the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft out of San Diego City College. He was the second player out of the 2001 draft to make it to the majors with the Cubs, the first being Mark Prior. Mitre made his major league debut for the Cubs in after being called up from the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx (at the time, West Tenn was the Cubs' Double-A affiliate). He played in 3 games in 2003 (2 starts) and had an 0‚Äì1 record with an 8.31 ERA. In , Mitre started out the season on the Opening Day roster, filling in for the injured Mark Prior. He was sent down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs after Prior came back from injury. On August 13, 2004, Mitre pitched a complete game shutout against the Albuquerque Isotopes. Mitre gave up only a double and a walk, both coming in the first inning of the game. After this, Mitre sat down 23 straight batters, striking out 9 batters in the game. He became the Pacific Coast League's Player of the Week. He finished the Iowa Cubs 2004 season (after going back and forth to Chicago) with a 6‚Äì4 record, and a 2.97 ERA. Mitre returned to the majors after the September roster expansions and pitched 4 games out of the bullpen. His season ending total was a 2‚Äì4 record with a 6.62 ERA in 12 games (9 starts). In , Mitre started off on Triple-A Iowa's roster, and on May 10, , he was recalled from Iowa, only to be sent down after two games and not pitching in either. On May 24, 2005, he was called up for a spot start. On June 14, 2005, Mitre pitched his first complete game, along with his first shutout in a 14‚Äì0 victory over the Florida Marlins against Josh Beckett. =Florida Marlins= On December 7, 2005, Mitre and minor league pitchers Ricky Nolasco and Renyel Pinto were traded to the Florida Marlins for Juan Pierre. Mitre pitched 15 games for the Marlins in . Mitre in . In the season, Mitre won a career-high five games. He also set career bests with 27 games played, 27 starts, 149.0 innings pitched and 80 strikeouts. Mitre had a streak of not allowing an earned run in 24.2 consecutive innings. This streak lasted five starts, beginning May 20 at Tampa and ending June 15 at Kansas City. He made Marlins history with his 1.12 ERA in May, the second lowest for a starting pitcher during May in Marlins history, a feat only topped by Chris Hammond, who turned in a 0.61 ERA in May . Mitre began to see injury problems beginning in 2007, missing two weeks with a blister on his right middle finger, and time later in the season for a strained right hamstring. He had three stints on the disabled list, foreshadowing his season. Mitre did not play in a game in 2008. On July 15, Mitre underwent Tommy John ligament replacement surgery to fix right forearm tightness. As is the case with all Tommy John surgery patients, he was expected to miss 12‚Äì18 months. He was released by the Marlins at the end of the 2008 season. =New York Yankees= On November 3, Mitre signed a one-year minor league contract with the New York Yankees with an option for 2010. Mitre was suspended for the first 50 games of the 2009 season after testing positive for androstenedione in August 2008. Mitre said the androstenedione came from a contaminated legal supplement purchased from GNC, but took full responsibility for his actions. He served his suspension while still on the disabled list from last year's Tommy John surgery.Yankees RHP Mitre to Get 50 Game Suspension ESPN.com, January 6, 2009 Mitre returned to action, pitching well in nine starts for the Single-A Tampa Yankees and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees. Replacing an injured Chien-Ming Wang, Mitre was called up to the majors to start against the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday, July 21, 2009. Mitre pitched 5 innings, allowed 3 runs, and got the win. Mitre earned a World Series ring when the Yankees won their 27th World Series title, though he was not on the postseason roster. Mitre recorded his first career save on August 19, 2010, pitching the last 3 innings of a Yankees 11‚Äì5 win over the Detroit Tigers. ESPN.com, August 19, 2010 =Milwaukee Brewers= On March 25, 2011, Mitre was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Chris Dickerson. He was designated for assignment on June 27, after posting a 3.27 ERA in 33 innings. =Return to the Yankees= Mitre was traded back to the Yankees on June 29 for cash considerations. On June 19, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with inflammation in his right shoulder.http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/6784762/new-york- yankees-put-sergio-mitre-dl-shoulder-inflammation In four games with the Yankees, he posted an 11.81 ERA and was not offered a contract for the 2012 season. =Post MLB= After his MLB career, Mitre played baseball in Japan while continuing to rehab his shoulder. He was unable to make a comeback, and retired as an active player. Eventually, Mitre returned to California. He was a coach for a competitive baseball organization that he founded called the Playmakers. On April 29, 2017, Mitre came out of retirement and signed with the Bravos de Le√≥n of the Mexican Baseball League. He was traded to the Toros de Tijuana on July 9, 2017. He was released from the organization on July 26, 2018. On January 26, 2019, Mitre signed with the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos of the Mexican League. He was released on May 9, 2019. On May 14, 2019, Mitre signed with the Saraperos de Saltillo of the Mexican League. Legal troubles On September 1, 2019, while playing for the Saraperos de Saltillo of the Mexican League, Mitre was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a woman (thought to be his girlfriend), after employees at a Quality Inn in Saltillo alerted authorities of a domestic violence situation taking place inside a suite. Following his arrest, the Saraperos owner denounced Mitre's actions and he was later suspended indefinitely by the team. However, these charges were eventually dropped and Mitre was reinstated by the Saraperos prior to the 2020 season (which was later canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic). On July 13, 2020, Mitre was arrested in Saltillo for possession of marijuana. On July 14, Mitre was charged with femicide and aggravated statutory rape over the death and possible sexual assault of his girlfriend's daughter; he was booked into the Saltillo Prison.

It occurs in plants and animals. Photoperiodism can also be defined as the developmental responses of plants to the relative lengths of light and dark periods. They are classified under three groups according to the photoperiods: short-day plants, long-day plants, and day- neutral plants.  Plants  Pr converts to Pfr during the day time and Pfr slowly reverts to Pr during the night time. When nights are short, an excess amount of Pfr remains in the day time and during long nights, most of the Pfr is reverted to Pr. Many flowering plants (angiosperms) use a photoreceptor protein, such as phytochrome or cryptochrome, to sense seasonal changes in night length, or photoperiod, which they take as signals to flower. In a further subdivision, obligate photoperiodic plants absolutely require a long or short enough night before flowering, whereas facultative photoperiodic plants are more likely to flower under one condition. Phytochrome comes in two forms: Pr and Pfr. Red light (which is present during the day) converts phytochrome to its active form (pfr). This then triggers the plant to grow. In turn, far-red light is present in the shade or in the dark and this converts phytochrome from pfr to pr. Pr is the inactive form of phytochrome and will not allow for plant growth. This system of Pfr to Pr conversion allows the plant to sense when it is night and when it is day. Pfr can also be converted back to Pr by a process known as dark reversion, where long periods of darkness trigger the conversion of Pfr. This is important in regards to plant flowering. Experiments by Halliday et al. showed that manipulations of the red-to far-red ratio in Arabidopsis can alter flowering. They discovered that plants tend to flower later when exposed to more red light, proving that red light is inhibitory to flowering. Other experiments have proven this by exposing plants to extra red-light in the middle of the night. A short-day plant will not flower if light is turned on for a few minutes in the middle of the night and a long-day plant can flower if exposed to more red-light in the middle of the night. Cryptochromes are another type of photoreceptor that is important in photoperiodism. Cryptochromes absorb blue light and UV-A. Cryptochromes entrain the circadian clock to light. It has been found that both cryptochrome and phytochrome abundance relies on light and the amount of cryptochrome can change depending on day-length. This shows how important both of the photoreceptors are in regards to determining day-length. In 1920, W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard published their discoveries on photoperiodism and felt it was the length of daylight that was critical, but it was later discovered that the length of the night was the controlling factor. Photoperiodic flowering plants are classified as long-day plants or short-day plants even though night is the critical factor because of the initial misunderstanding about daylight being the controlling factor. Along with long-day plants and short-day plants, there are plants that fall into a \\"dual-day length category\\". These plants are either long-short-day plants (LSDP) or short-long- day plants (SLDP). LSDPs flower after a series of long days followed by short days whereas SLDPs flower after a series of short days followed by long days. Each plant has a different length critical photoperiod, or critical night length. Modern biologists believe that it is the coincidence of the active forms of phytochrome or cryptochrome, created by light during the daytime, with the rhythms of the circadian clock that allows plants to measure the length of the night. Other than flowering, photoperiodism in plants includes the growth of stems or roots during certain seasons and the loss of leaves. Artificial lighting can be used to induce extra-long days. = Long-day plants = Long-day plants flower when the night length falls below their critical photoperiod. These plants typically flower during late spring or early summer as days are getting longer. In the northern hemisphere, the longest day of the year (summer solstice) is on or about 21 June. After that date, days grow shorter (i.e. nights grow longer) until 21 December (the winter solstice). This situation is reversed in the southern hemisphere (i.e., longest day is 21 December and shortest day is 21 June). Some long-day obligate plants are: * Carnation (Dianthus) * Henbane (Hyoscyamus) * Oat (Avena) Some long-day facultative plants are: * Pea (Pisum sativum) * Barley (Hordeum vulgare) * Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) * Wheat (Triticum aestivum) = Short-day plants = Short-day plants flower when the night lengths exceed their critical photoperiod. They cannot flower under short nights or if a pulse of artificial light is shone on the plant for several minutes during the night; they require a continuous period of darkness before floral development can begin. Natural nighttime light, such as moonlight or lightning, is not of sufficient brightness or duration to interrupt flowering. In general, short-day (i.e.long-night) plants flower as days grow shorter (and nights grow longer) after 21 June in the northern hemisphere, which is during summer or fall. The length of the dark period required to induce flowering differs among species and varieties of a species. Photoperiodism affects flowering by inducing the shoot to produce floral buds instead of leaves and lateral buds. Some short- day facultative plants are: * Kenaf ( Hibiscus cannabinus) * Marijuana (Cannabis) * Cotton (Gossypium) * Rice (Oryza) * Jowar (Sorghum bicolor) * Green Gram (Mung bean, Vigna radiata) * Soybeans (Glycine max) = Day-neutral plants = Day-neutral plants, such as cucumbers, roses, tomatoes, and Ruderalis (autoflowering cannabis) do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism. Instead, they may initiate flowering after attaining a certain overall developmental stage or age, or in response to alternative environmental stimuli, such as vernalisation (a period of low temperature).  Animal  Daylength, and thus knowledge of the season of the year, is vital to many animals. A number of biological and behavioural changes are dependent on this knowledge. Together with temperature changes, photoperiod provokes changes in the color of fur and feathers, migration, entry into hibernation, sexual behaviour, and even the resizing of sexual organs. The singing frequency of birds such as the canary depends on the photoperiod. In the spring, when the photoperiod increases (more daylight), the male canary's testes grow. As the testes grow, more androgens are secreted and song frequency increases. During autumn, when the photoperiod decreases (less daylight), the male canary's testes regress and androgen levels drop dramatically, resulting in decreased singing frequency. Not only is singing frequency dependent on the photoperiod but the song repertoire is also. The long photoperiod of spring results in a greater song repertoire. Autumn's shorter photoperiod results in a reduction in song repertoire. These behavioral photoperiod changes in male canaries are caused by changes in the song center of the brain. As the photoperiod increases, the high vocal center (HVC) and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA) increase in size. When the photoperiod decreases, these areas of the brain regress.Nelson Randy J. (2005) An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (p.189). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates. In mammals, daylength is registered in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is informed by retinal light-sensitive ganglion cells, which are not involved in vision. The information travels through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Some mammals are highly seasonal, while humans' seasonality is largely believed to be evolutionary baggage.

A jam session is a relatively informal musical event, process, or activity where musicians, typically instrumentalists, play improvised solos and vamp on tunes, songs and chord progressions. To \\"jam\\" is to improvise music without extensive preparation or predefined arrangements, except for when the group is playing well-known jazz standards or covers of existing popular songs. Original jam sessions, also 'free flow sessions', are often used by musicians to develop new material (music) and find suitable arrangements. Both styles can be used simply as a social gathering and communal practice session. Jam sessions may be based upon existing songs or forms, may be loosely based on an agreed chord progression or chart suggested by one participant, or may be wholly improvisational. Jam sessions can range from very loose gatherings of amateurs to evenings where a jam session coordinator or host acts as a \\"gatekeeper\\" to ensure that only appropriate- level performers take the stage, to sophisticated improvised recording sessions by professionals which are intended to be broadcast live on radio or TV or edited and released to the public.  Jazz  One source for the phrase \\"jam session\\" came about in the 1920s when white and black musicians would congregate after their regular paying gigs, to play the jazz they could not play in the \\"Paul Whiteman\\" style bands they played in. When Bing Crosby would attend these sessions, the musicians would say he was \\"jammin' the beat\\", since he would clap on the one and the three. Thus these sessions became known as \\"jam sessions\\".\\"Really The Blues\\" by Mezz Mezzrow Mezz Mezzrow also gives this more detailed and self-referential description, based on his experience at the jazz speakeasy known as the Three Deuces: The New York scene during World War II was famous for its after-hours jam sessions. One of the most famous was the regular after-hours jam at Minton's Playhouse in New York City that ran in the 1940s and early 1950s. The jam sessions at Minton's were a fertile meeting place and proving ground for both established soloists like Ben Webster and Lester Young, and the younger jazz musicians who would soon become leading exponents of the bebop movement, including Thelonious Monk (Minton's house pianist), saxophone player Charlie Parker, and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. The Minton's jams had competitive \\"cutting contests\\", in which soloists would try to keep up with the house band and outdo each other in improvisational skill.  Afro-Cuban music  Influenced by jazz, Cuban music saw the emergence of improvised jam sessions during the filin movement of the 1940s, where boleros, sones and other song types were performed in an extended form called descarga. During the 1950s these descargas became the basis of a new genre of improvised jams based on the son montuno with notable jazz influences pioneered by the likes of Julio Guti√©rrez and Cachao. During the 1960s, descargas played an important role in the development of salsa, especially the salsa dura style.  Rock  Phish is an example of a \\"jam band\\". As the instrumental proficiency of pop and rock musicians improved in the 1960s and early 1970s, onstage jamming‚Äîfree improvisation‚Äîalso became a regular feature of rock music; bands such as Pink Floyd, Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Deep Purple, The Who, the Grateful Dead, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Santana, King Crimson, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers Band would feature live improvised performances that could last 10 to 20 minutes or longer. In this context, jams are not casual get-togethers, but rather improvised portions of rehearsed public concerts. = Jam bands = Though the Grateful Dead are often credited as being the first jam band, Cream incorporated long improvisations into their songs as early as 1967. However, the Grateful Dead allowed the \\"jam band\\" to become a genre unto itself; more recent bands following in their steps include Phish, moe., Umphreys Mcgee, and Widespread Panic, all of which feature extended improvisational sessions. Other bands, such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers also regularly perform live jam sessions. Progressive rock band Coheed and Cambria often end shows with a jam session to their song \\"The Final Cut\\" with different instruments.  Bluegrass  Bluegrass pickin'. Bluegrass music also features a tradition of jamming. Bluegrass jams happen in the parking lots and campgrounds of bluegrass festivals, in music stores, bars and restaurants and on stages. Bluegrass jams tend to be segregated by the skill level of the players. Slow jams for beginners provide an entry point. Open bluegrass jams are open to all comers, but the players in an open jam will expect a certain level of proficiency from participants. The abilities to hear chord progressions and keep time are essential, and the ability to play improvised leads that contain at least a suggestion of the melody is desirable. Jams that require advanced musical proficiency are generally private events, by invitation only.  Soulquarians  Members of the Soulquarians, an alternative-minded black music collective active from the late 1990s to early 2000s, held jam sessions while recording their respective albums at Electric Lady Studios. This began in 1997 when the singer D'Angelo and drummer-producer Questlove (of The Roots) prepared to record the former's Voodoo (2000) album at the studio. Their sessions there over the next five years resulted in the Roots' albums Things Fall Apart (1999) and Phrenology (2002), singer Erykah Badu's second album Mama's Gun (2000), rapper Common's Like Water for Chocolate (2000) and Electric Circus (2002), and singer Bilal's debut album 1st Born Second. Badu has said that \\"just about everything from [Mama's Gun] was a jam\\". The Roots performing in 2007 According to music journalist Michael Gonzales, their sessions were marked by an experimentation with \\"dirty soul, muddy water blues, Black Ark dub science, mix-master madness, screeching guitars, old school hip-hop, gutbucket romanticism, inspired lyricism, African chats and aesthetics, pimpin' politics, strange Moogs, Kraftwerk synths and spacey noise\\". The musical approach also influenced the collective's associated musicians, including rapper Mos Def's Black on Both Sides (1999), singer Res's How I Do (2001), and rapper Talib Kweli's Quality (2002). Bilal held improvisatory jam sessions while recording his second album, Love for Sale, at Electric Lady, although its experimental direction alienated his label from releasing it, and a subsequent leak led to its indefinite shelving. Common's similarly experimental Electric Circus sold disappointingly, which discouraged MCA Records, Common and the Roots' label, from letting the artistically-free environment at the studio to continue. In 2018, leading up to the Grammy Awards, the Roots used their four-day residency at the Gramercy Theatre in New York to \\"revive a long tradition of jam-session concerts with unannounced special guests\\", including Common, Big K.R.I.T., Wyclef Jean, Roxanne Shant√©, Gary Clark, Jr., and Mtume.

Written by series creator and executive producer Constance M. Burge and directed by John T. Kretchmer, it was first broadcast in the United States on The WB on October 7, 1998. \\"Something Wicca This Way Comes\\" was the highest rated episode of Charmed in the entire series. It was watched by 7.7 million viewers and broke the record for the highest-rated premiere episode in The WB's history, being later surpassed by the pilot episode of Smallville. The series focuses on the lives of three Halliwell sisters, known as the Charmed Ones: Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano), as they deal with their grandmother's death and learn that they inherited a little more than the house they grew up in. All three of them have inherited magic powers; Prue has the power of telekinesis, Piper has the power to freeze time, and Phoebe has the power of premonition. Together they try to live everyday normal lives in San Francisco, while battling demons and warlocks, and keeping their supernatural identities a secret. The name of this episode is a play on words from Shakespeare's Macbeth: \\"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.\\" Plot Piper (Holly Marie Combs) arrives late at the Halliwell Manor, which infuriates Prue (Shannen Doherty) as they were trying to get an electrician. Prue states that Piper's boyfriend Jeremy (Eric Scott Woods) has sent some flowers and a bottle of Port, the ingredient she needs for her showpiece recipe in the morning. Piper sees an old spirit board that Prue found in the basement while she was looking for a circuit tester. She turns it over to see the inscription on the back. The pair then begin to wonder about their sister Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) who is living in New York. Prue suggests that they should rent out the spare room at a reduced rate in exchange for fixing things around the house. Piper suggests that Phoebe could move in before admitting that two weeks earlier she had agreed to allow her sister to move back in. Prue is not happy with this since she and Phoebe had fallen out over Prue's husband-to-be, Roger (Matthew Ashford). Phoebe, who is broke, had been accused of sleeping with Roger causing Prue to break off the engagement. Phoebe and Piper are seen playing with the spirit board. As Piper goes into the kitchen, the pointer on the spirit board starts to spell a word. Phoebe freaks out and calls in Piper and then Prue to see what the pointer is doing but it doesn't move while all three are watching. She tries to convince both sisters that the pointer is moving and making out a word, but they do not believe her since Phoebe is known to have moved the pointer in the past. Piper then sees the pointer move briefly and then the spirit board finally spells out the word \\"attic\\" as Phoebe writes it down on paper. As the storm continues, the power goes out. Piper and Prue head off to the fuse panel, but Phoebe follows the spirit board's prompt and heads to the attic. The door is locked but suddenly opens and Phoebe is guided to a wooden chest. Opening the chest, she discovers a large, ancient book called the Book of Shadows. Unaware of the powers involved, but overcome with curiosity, she reads a page aloud, which mentions three sisters and the power of three having the active powers of an ancestor named Melinda Warren. The spell bestows Phoebe with premonitions, Piper with molecular immobilization, and Prue with telekinesis. Prue tells Phoebe that the book is of witchcraft but they believe that nothing has changed. In fact, the photo of the three sisters has changed, as they have magically moved closer to each other, but the sisters don't see it. In the morning Prue is confronted by her ex Roger, who is also her boss. He removes her from the project that she had been looking after. Prue quits her job but her anger unwittingly causes her to make his pen explode and his necktie to nearly strangle him. Piper runs out of time and can't complete her dish until she accidentally freezes the chef of the restaurant which allows her to finish the sauce off and get the job. Whilst Phoebe is riding her bike, she gets a premonition of two boys on roller skates being involved in a car accident and she prevents the accident by causing herself to have an accident. Prue still has problems accepting that they are witches and sees her power in action for the first time when putting cream in her drink. While Prue is in a pharmacy looking for aspirin, Phoebe observes that Prue uses her power when she is angry. Phoebe winds her sister up over Roger and their Dad, which causes Prue to knock most of the stock off the shelves. Meanwhile, Piper is on a date with Jeremy, who is actually a warlock that steals the powers of good witches. Jeremy says that he knew all about them the whole time, hence why he started dating Piper six months beforehand when their grandmother went into hospital. He then shows Piper the powers of the witch whom he killed at the start of the episode. While Jeremy attempts to stab Piper with an athame, she freezes him and escapes before telling Prue and Phoebe what happened. The trio then create a potion which injures Jeremy and Phoebe has a premonition that he has been wounded but not defeated. After trying to blockade themselves from Jeremy, Prue remembers the inscription on the spirit board and the sisters hold hands chanting \\"The power of three will set us free\\" until he is killed. Production An unaired pilot for the series was first shot, with some scenes filmed in the actual manor that is shown on the show, located at 1329 Carroll Avenue in Los Angeles. Lori Rom and Chris Boyd were originally cast to play Phoebe and Andy, and were later recast. After Lori Rom leaving Charmed, executive producer Aaron Spelling asked Alyssa Milano, whom he knew from Melrose Place, to be her replacement and the show moved to a sound studio. The unaired pilot is featured in a bonus disc of some editions of the complete series DVD releases. Reception In 2016, Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV ran a series of Charmed articles in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the series finale. The first was a complete season review of season one, including the pilot episode, in which Gavin comments that the episode is a \\"classic\\", and that he \\"loved the episode\\".
