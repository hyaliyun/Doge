Speaking on her influences, SZA said: \\"[My] personal influences came from dancing with American Ballet Theatre and doing pieces to Björk [music]. That's the only time I had really any outside influence to music. So, the people that I fell in love with on a musical level were always much older. Jamiroquai is just, like, the shit for me.\\" In an interview for Live Nation Entertainment, SZA described the meeting she had with Beyoncé for the writing of the song \\"Feeling Myself\\", affirming \\"Beyoncé might be the most perfect, beautiful being I've ever met in my whole life. She's the most inspirational woman on earth, next to my mother\\". SZA also spoke about Rihanna, admiring her strong and confident attitude, of someone who does only the music she wants to do, and that if there's anybody that she could imagine singing her words, it would be Rihanna. During an interview, SZA said she is less inspired by strictly music, and more inspired by creating art in general; she has looked up to people who were not \\"typical artists\\" including her \\"favorite gymnast, ice- skater, saxophonist, painter, or movie director,\\" continuing to say she was particularly inspired by film director Spike Lee. During an interview with W, SZA spoke on her style influences, saying a large amount of her style inspiration comes from movies, including Wes Anderson films, praising his use of \\"pantone color palette\\" and that she \\"would love to dress like a character from Moonrise Kingdom. Or perhaps Bill Murray in The Life Aquatic.\\" Along with her music, SZA's image has been compared to neo-soul artists Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu.

He was signed by the Cardinals as an amateur free agent in December 2012, and made his MLB debut for them August 9, 2016. The Cardinals' top prospect entering both the 2015 and 2016 seasons, Baseball America named him the second-best prospect overall in their 2016 mid-season ranking. He has played in two All-Star Futures Games and was one of two Cardinals' Co-Minor League Pitchers of the Year in 2015. Early life Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to Tomás, Sr., and Dignora Reyes, Alexander Reyes is the youngest of three sons, including Tomás, Jr., and Adriel. While he was attending Elizabeth High School, he was 5'11\\" [] and threw a maximum of . He lived in New Jersey until he was 18. With his family unable to afford to send him to showcases and tryouts, he moved to the Dominican Republic in December 2011. There, it would be much easier to gain the attention of scouts to increase his chances of signing with a Major League Baseball (MLB) team as a free agent rather than be selected through the amateur draft had he remained in the United States. In the Dominican Republic, Reyes lived with each of his grandmothers in San Cristóbal, enabling him to gain residency and the notice of scouts, known colloquially as buscones. Shortstop Raúl A. Mondesí, the son of San Cristóbal mayor and former MLB outfielder Raúl Mondesí, worked out with Reyes and attracted the attention of a buscón known simply as Valera, who also noticed Reyes. Reyes tried out with Valera before St. Louis Cardinals scout Rodny Jiménez noticed him. The Cardinals observed Reyes work out in Palenque, of the Sabana Grande de Palenque municipality, near San Cristóbal, and invited him for a private workout in their team academy in Santo Domingo. At that point, he had reached speeds of up to . Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak commented that Reyes' athleticism was one important factor that caused the team to consider the young pitcher. Because he had emigrated from the United States, MLB regulations stated that Reyes must wait one year to sign with an MLB franchise as an international free agent, delaying the Cardinals' opportunity to sign him for six months. In December 2012, he signed a $950,000 deal with St. Louis. Professional career =Minor leagues= Reyes made his professional debut in 2013 for the Johnson City Cardinals of the Appalachian League. In 12 starts, he went 6–4 with a 3.39 earned run average (ERA) with 68 strikeouts (SO) in innings pitched (IP). Prior to the 2014 season, Baseball America ranked him as the seventh-best prospect in the Cardinals organization. Also, Baseball Prospectus determined him the 98th-best prospect in all of baseball. He spent the 2014 season with the Single-A Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League. There, he notched a 7–7 record to go with a 3.62 ERA and 137 strikeouts in innings. He said: \\"I learn from watching. I don't think ... he even knows, but Rob Kaminsky is definitely the number one guy I've studied. From day one in Peoria he just separated himself from everyone on the pitching staff, including me.\\"Taking Flight: The St. Louis Cardinals and the Building of Baseball's Best Franchise - Rob Rains, Whitey Herzog (2016). Prior to the start of the 2015 season, Baseball America ranked Reyes as the 51st-best prospect in all professional baseball, and Baseball Prospectus ranked him 55th. Jim Callis selected Reyes as the Cardinals' top prospect for 2015, and although he did not make MLB.com's top 100, Callis named him the best pitching prospect not on that list. The recipient of a late growth spurt, it was in class-A level that Reyes began to throw at and had grown to a height of 6'4\\" (190 cm). Playing for the Class A-Advanced Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League (FSL) in 2015, Reyes was the Cardinals' Minor League Pitcher of the month in April. He led the FSL with 35 SO and allowed a 1.71 ERA over innings. His 13-strikeout performance on June 17 was a season-high. Including his previous 10 outings, he had posted a 1.79 ERA and 70 SO in innings. On June 25, Reyes was selected to represent the World Team in the All-Star Futures Game after leading all of the minor leagues with a ratio of 13.4 strikeouts per nine innings pitched (SO/9). He had registered a 2–5 record and 2.08 ERA while striking out 90 and walking 30 in IP. He was also selected to play in the 2015 FSL mid-season All-Star game. With a 2.26 ERA, 49 hits and zero home runs allowed with 96 strikeouts in innings over 13 FSL starts, the Cardinals promoted Reyes to the AA Springfield Cardinals of the Texas League in July 2015. The next month, Baseball America rated him as throwing the FSL's best fastball, best breaking pitch, and as the \\"best pitching prospect\\" in the league in 2015, according to a poll of managers and coaches. He totaled a 5–7 record and 2.49 ERA over 22 starts in 2015, striking out 151 in innings while allowing a .197 opposing batting average. The Cardinals selected him to play for the Surprise Saguaros of the off-season Arizona Fall League (AFL). Baseball America also selected Reyes for the high Class-A minor leagues All-Star team for the 2015 season. He and Austin Gomber were selected the Cardinals' co-Minor League Pitchers of the Year for 2015. After he tested positive for marijuana, Major League Baseball announced on November 9, 2015, that they were suspending Reyes for 50 games including the remainder of the AFL season and the start of the 2016 season. Baseball America selected Reyes as the top Cardinals' prospect entering the 2016 season. MLB.com ranked him as the tenth-best prospect in all the minor leagues, and Baseball Prospectus at number 13. Reyes was activated from his suspension on May 22 to make his first start for the Memphis Redbirds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. Baseball America moved his rank to second of all prospects in baseball in their 2016 mid-season update. Selected to play his second All-Star Futures Game for 2016 at Petco Park in San Diego, Reyes was the starting pitcher for the World team, striking out four of the five outs he recorded as World won, 11−3. His 2016 totals with Memphis included a 2−3 record, 4.96 ERA, 93 strikeouts and 32 walks in 65 innings. =St. Louis Cardinals= 2016 The Cardinals purchased Reyes' contract on August 9, 2016, and added him to the major league roster to serve as a relief pitcher. He made his major league debut the same night against the Cincinnati Reds, pitching a perfect inning and striking out fellow rookie Adam Duvall for his first in the major leagues. Reyes earned his first major league win on August 13, 2016, against the Chicago Cubs, and first save on August 19 against the Philadelphia Phillies. After five appearances and innings in relief with 13 strikeouts and no runs surrendered, he made his first MLB start on August 27 against the Oakland Athletics. He completed innings, allowing one run, two hits and four walks while striking out four. The first run charged to Reyes in his major league career occurred when reliever Zach Duke walked Khris Davis with the bases loaded to score Bruce Maxwell in the fifth, ending 14 consecutive scoreless innings. The Athletics won, 3−2. The Cardinals, attempting to make the playoffs, called upon Reyes to start against fellow contenders, including seven scoreless innings against San Francisco on September 23 and, in his next outing, three runs in five innings against Chicago. As a starting pitcher, Reyes was credited with a 4−1 record; his only loss came against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 7. He completed relief innings, surrendering one earned run and eight hits while striking out 23. In 46 total innings with St. Louis in 2016, Reyes struck out 52; his 1.57 ERA ranked second among all major league rookie relief pitchers with at least 20 innings. 2017 On February 14, 2017, Reyes was diagnosed with a partial tear of his ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. The next day, it was announced Reyes would undergo Tommy John surgery, shelving him for the entire 2017 season. He had successful surgery on February 16. 2018 After sitting out all of 2017, Reyes began rehabbing in 2018. In a rehab start on May 19 with the Springfield Cardinals he pitched 7 scoreless innings, allowing only one hit and striking out 13, tying Springfield's team record. On May 24 during a rehab start with the Memphis Redbirds, Reyes struck out nine consecutive batters, making him the first pitcher in Pacific Coast League history to strike out nine batters in a row. In four total rehab starts between Springfield, the Peoria Chiefs, Palm Beach Cardinals and Memphis, he pitched 23 scoreless innings in which he struck out 44, walked seven, and gave up only seven hits. Reyes was activated from the 60-day DL on May 30 to start against the Milwaukee Brewers. Making his first major league appearance since September 29, 2016, Reyes pitched four scoreless innings, allowing three hits while walking two and striking out two. He was placed on the 10-day DL the next day with a right lat strain that he suffered during his start against Milwaukee.http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/23661968/alex-reyes-st-louis- cardinals-back-disabled-list On June 6, Reyes underwent surgery for a torn tendon in his lat muscle, effectively ending his season.http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/23717189/alex-reyes-st-louis- cardinals-surgery-torn-tendon-lat-muscle 2019 Reyes entered the 2019 season and began the year in St. Louis' bullpen.

Noted to have prodigious lateral and horizontal movement, the fastball typically ranges from to , making it very difficult for batters to hit solidly. It is most effective high in the strike zone. The curveball has been called a \\"wipeout\\" pitch with a vertical falling pattern following the points from \\"12-to-6\\" on the clock, making it equally difficult for batters to hit well. The combination of both the fastball and curveball contributes to the significantly-above normal strikeout rates. Reyes typically throws both pitches for strikes, although his command of the fastball was below average. The changeup will need increased refinement. His walk rate is higher than normal, but he gave up just one total home run in 2015. In 2016, Baseball Prospectus pronounced that Reyes \\"has one of the highest ceilings of any current pitching prospect.\\" Personal Reyes has a daughter, Aleyka, who was born in July 2016.https://www.vivaelbirdos.com/st-louis-cardinals-news-analysis- mlb/2017/2/17/14648786/alex-reyes-update-on-tommy-john-surgery-and-his- adorable-daughter-a-hunt-and-peck Awards * Baseball America Minor Leagues Classification All-Star (2015) * Baseball America Best Tools – Florida State League (2015): ** Best pitching prospect ** Best fastball ** Best breaking pitch * Florida State League Mid-season All-Star (2015) * 2× Major League Baseball All-Star Futures Game (2015, 2016) * St. Louis Cardinals Minor Leagues Pitcher of the Month (April 2015) * St. Louis Cardinals Minor Leagues Pitcher of the Year (2015) See also *List of baseball players who underwent Tommy John surgery References External links *Alex Reyes: The Best Pitching Prospect You’ve Never Heard Of  Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Elizabeth High School (New Jersey) alumni Category:Sportspeople from Elizabeth, New Jersey Category:Baseball players from New Jersey Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Johnson City Cardinals players Category:Peoria Chiefs players Category:Gulf Coast Cardinals players Category:Palm Beach Cardinals players Category:Springfield Cardinals players Category:Surprise Saguaros players Category:Memphis Redbirds players ","title":"Alex Reyes"},{"id":"42376487","text":"Shanghai 13, also known as The Shanghai Thirteen, is a 1984 Hong Kong- Taiwanese martial arts film written and directed by Chang Cheh and starring an ensemble cast of notable film stars such as Andy Lau, Jimmy Wang Yu, Ti Lung, Chen Kuan-tai, Danny Lee, Bryan Leung, David Chiang, Chiang Sheng, Chi Kuan- chun, Chan Sing, Lu Feng and more.

In order to ensure a smooth arrival of Mr. Gao and the contract to Hong Kong, Shanghai Tycoon Shen Gang-fu (Chen Kuan-tai) decides to send his underlings, the Shanghai 13, to protect Gao while on his way to the dock. Unexpectedly, there are moles among the 13 men who betray Gao and Shen. With obstacles ahead and pursuers behind, under the condition of obstruction by the traitors, can Mr. Gao successfully arrive to the dock? Are the Shanghai 13 loyal or evil? On the road to the dock, there are murderous traps everywhere and bloody battles appear one after another.

Tracking of metabolic activity via VO2 measurement during treadmill walking. Cost of transport [COT] In human gait, to travel a particular distance, chemical energy must be expended by the body.

Preferred Gait  Qualitative illustration of the relationship between walking speed and cost of transport (COT). The green line indicates the walking speed with minimum COT. Qualitative illustration of the relationship between step rate (or cadence) and rate of energy expenditure at a fixed walking speed of ~90 m/min. Metabolic cost is naturally optimized by selection of a nominal gait. While external factors such as instability and perceived dangers may temporarily alter the body's priorities, the primary goal of minimizing a task-dependent energetic expenditureMcNeill Alexander, R. (2002). Energetics and optimization of human walking and running: the 2000 Raymond Pearl memorial lecture. American Journal of Human Biology, 14(5), 641-648. ultimately dominates the determination of preferred walking gait. As a result, humans tend to select a preferred walking speed that minimizes their cost of transport. The relationship between walking and cost of transport is parabola- like with the preferred walking speed at the minimum, meaning walking at a slower or faster speed can incur a similar increase in energetic cost for a 1-kilometer walk. Within each walking speed, the step length and cadence are also optimized for metabolic cost. While multiple proportional combinations of step length and cadence can be used to achieve the same walking speed, taking faster and shorter steps or slower and longer steps than the optimal combination leads to increased cost of transport.Zarrugh, M. Y., & Radcliffe, C. W. (1978). Predicting metabolic cost of level walking. European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology, 38(3), 215-223.  Gait Parameter Definitions  The parameters of gait for a fixed walking speed all vary with the size (e.g. leg length) of different individuals. However, a typical or average self-selected value can be estimated based on average human size. The mechanical work and metabolic cost associated with these parameters can be described by the dynamic walking model. = Step Length= Step length is a measure of the distance, parallel to the direction of travel, between the initial point of contact of one foot and the successive initial point of contact of the opposite foot. The step lengths for left and right are similar in normal gait. Another metric similar to step length is known as stride length, which measures the distance between successive points of initial contact of the same foot, and left and right stride lengths are normally equivalent. At self-selected walking speeds, normal step length is approximately 0.75 meters for men and slightly less for women due to a gender- specific shorter average leg length.Sekiya, N., Nagasaki, H., Ito, H., & Furuna, T. (1997). Optimal walking in terms of variability in step length. Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy, 26(5), 266-272. For other walking speeds, the preferred step length can be approximately predicted based on the relationship \\\\textstyle s \\\\; \\\\alpha \\\\; v^{0.42}, where \\\\textstyle s is step length and \\\\textstyle v is walking speed.Grieve, D. W. (1968). Gait patterns and the speed of walking. Biomedical Engineering, 3(3), 119-122. =Cadence= Cadence is a metric of walking rate, typically measured in number of steps per minute. This parameter is also termed as step frequency. At self-selected walking speeds, the step frequency is approximately 100 steps/min.Cavagna, G. A., & Franzetti, P. (1986). The determinants of the step frequency in walking in humans. The Journal of physiology, 373(1), 235-242. =Step Width= Step width is a measure of the distance, perpendicular to the each foot midline, between the initial point of contact of one foot and the successive initial point of contact of the opposite foot. At self-selected walking speeds, step width is typically around 10 to 12 cm. This is based on the relationship that equates step width to \\\\textstyle 0.12L , where \\\\textstyle L is leg length.Bauby, C. E., & Kuo, A. D. (2000). Active control of lateral balance in human walking. Journal of biomechanics, 33(11), 1433-1440. =Step Variability= Step variability is a measure of the standard deviation of step length and step width calculated from all valid steps during a single walking trial. At self-selected walking speeds, step width variability (~2.8 cm) is almost always greater than step length variability (~1.8 cm)Owings, T. M., & Grabiner, M. D. (2004). Step width variability, but not step length variability or step time variability, discriminates gait of healthy young and older adults during treadmill locomotion. Journal of biomechanics, 37(6), 935-938.  Dynamic Walking as a Framework for COT Center of mass on a massless leg travelling along the trunk trajectory path in inverted pendulum theory. Velocity vectors are shown perpendicular to the ground reaction force at time 1 and time 2. In dynamic walking, the human body can be modeled as the center of mass (COM) supported by a massless rigid leg in single support and two massless legs during double- support,Donelan, J. M., Kram, R., & Kuo, A. D. (2002). Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions is a major determinant of the metabolic cost of human walking. Journal of Experimental Biology, 205(23), 3717-3727. which is consistent with passive dynamics of the inverted pendulum, otherwise known as the inverted pendulum theory of gait. In single support, no work is done since the ground reaction force is perpendicular to the COM motion. In double support, the trailing leg works in conjunction with the leading leg to redirect the COM motion upward. During this step-to-step transition period, the trailing leg exerts positive mechanical work on the COM while the leading leg exerts negative mechanical work on the COM. To maintain steady walking gait requires the sum of these work terms, or the net work, to be equal to zero since any changes in system energy would impart different COM velocities between the start and end of transition. While the ideal net mechanical work of this system is zero, muscle contractions are necessary to generate the ground reaction forces, implying that the metabolic energy expended is nonzero. = Leg Swing Mechanics = The massless leg assumption in the inverted pendulum theory omits the amount of work required to swing the contralateral leg during single support. Due to the similarity of leg swing with the hanging pendulum paradigm, the work performed is dominated by gravity.Mochon, S., & McMahon, T. A. (1980). Ballistic walking: An improved model.Mathematical Biosciences, 52(3), 241-260. In the case that the leg is swung at a rate outside of the natural frequency, the hip torque generated by muscle action becomes significantly larger. For typical steady gait, it is approximated that the energy expended to perform leg swing accounts for 10% to 30% of the total metabolic energy consumed.Doke, J., Donelan, J. M., & Kuo, A. D. (2005). Mechanics and energetics of swinging the human leg. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 208(3), 439-445.Gottschall, J. S., & Kram, R. (2005). Energy cost and muscular activity required for leg swing during walking. Journal of Applied Physiology, 99(1), 23-30. = Gait Parameters and Energetic Cost = Changes to each individual gait parameter affects the energetic cost of walking. However, these same changes also affect other gait parameters, leading to trade offs that require the human body to apply optimizations that minimize energetic cost. *Step Length Energetic cost increases with longer step lengths due to increased ground reaction forces during double-support and more hip torque during the swing phase. According to the dynamic walking model, mechanical work in the step-to-step transitions increases proportional to step length and can be described by \\\\textstyle \\\\dot{W} \\\\; \\\\alpha \\\\; l^4, where \\\\textstyle \\\\dot{W} is mechanical work rate and \\\\textstyle l is step length, which equates to a proportional increase in net metabolic rate.Kuo, A. D., Donelan, J. M., & Ruina, A. (2005). Energetic consequences of walking like an inverted pendulum: step-to-step transitions. Exercise and sport sciences reviews, 33(2), 88-97. This relationship is due to reduced vertical force contribution for redirecting the COM at the wider step angles associated with longer step lengths. Larger step lengths also require additional hip torque during the swing phase to travel a wider angle, which contributes to the rate of metabolic cost by a factor of leg length squared *Cadence Increase in cadence yields more instances of leg swings and step-to-step transitions within a unit of time, leading to an increase in the rate of energetic cost. The relationship between mechanical work and step frequency can be described by \\\\textstyle \\\\dot{W} \\\\; \\\\alpha \\\\; f^3 for the step-to-step transitions, where \\\\textstyle \\\\dot{W} is the mechanical work rate and \\\\textstyle f is the step frequency. Rate of metabolic cost also follows this relationship. The impact of cadence on leg swing metabolic cost is approximated as \\\\textstyle \\\\dot{E} \\\\; \\\\alpha \\\\; f^4, where \\\\textstyle \\\\dot{E} is the rate of metabolic cost and \\\\textstyle f is the step frequency *Step Width Similar to selection of stride length and frequency, humans also select for a metabolically optimal step width. Adopting a wider stance increases the stability of a passive dynamic system, as well as increases the lateral clearance of the swing leg from the stance leg.Kuo, A. D. (1999). Stabilization of lateral motion in passive dynamic walking. The International journal of robotics research, 18(9), 917-930. According to the dynamic walking model, the mediolateral \\"rocking\\" of the legs can be also described by the inverted pendulum paradigm, and a wider stance would similarly require increased ground reaction force to redirect the COM, and thus increase the metabolic demand. For a narrower stance, due to insufficient clearance, hip torque may be increased to project the swing leg out laterally, leading to increased metabolic cost as well. The relationship between step width and energetic cost for the step-to-step transitions can be described as \\\\textstyle \\\\dot{E} \\\\; \\\\alpha \\\\; \\\\dot{W} \\\\; \\\\alpha \\\\; w^2, where \\\\textstyle \\\\dot{E} is the rate of metabolic cost, \\\\textstyle \\\\dot{W} is the mechanical work rate, and \\\\textstyle w is the step width. *Step Variability Step width variability is associated with the active control of the nervous system for walking stability, and is reduced in the presence of external stabilizersDonelan, J. M., Shipman, D. W., Kram, R., & Kuo, A. D. (2004). Mechanical and metabolic requirements for active lateral stabilization in human walking. Journal of biomechanics, 37(6), 827-835. while increased with exposure to balance perturbations. Step length variability is similarly attributed due to a coupling that exists between medio-lateral and fore-aft motion in walking, but to a diminished degree. Step width variability is positively correlated with rate of metabolic cost, and with respect to the variability associated with mediolateral balance, accounts for about 6% of metabolic cost in preferred gait. While some of the energetic cost encountered with step variability may arise due to the net changes in step width and step length, there exists a portion of the cost that can be attributed to the effort of stability control during walking.  Constrained Optimization  Energetic Cost Contour Plot. Coutour lines represent parameter combinations that require the same cost of transport. The colored lines represent optimization to different parameters: (green) step frequency; (red) walking speed; (blue)step length. Since multiple distinct gait parameters have a significant impact on the energetic cost of walking, each of these parameters have to be considered when examining the primary goal of metabolic cost optimization. The visualization of such an optimization for walking speed, cadence, and step length can be expressed in the form of a contour map, in which parameter combinations that lie on the same contour line share the same cost of transport (cal/kg/m).Bertram, J. E., & Ruina, A. (2001). Multiple walking speed–frequency relations are predicted by constrained optimization. Journal of theoretical Biology, 209(4), 445-453. The green, red, and blue, dotted lines represent values where cadence, walking speed, and step length are constrained, respectively. These lines can be formed by finding the tangent points that lines representative of several constant parameter values form with the constant COT contours. For example, the optimal COT's for constrained walking speeds (red) can be found by drawing vertical lines and noting where they form a tangent with a contour, as seen with point B in the diagram. A series of these intersections can then form the curve for optimal COT under constrained walking speed. These constrained optimization values not only reflect the naturally selected preferred gait parameters that are observed by fixing a single parameter at different values, but also form part of a predictive map that allows for the identification of the cost of transport for a multivariate system.

It was written by Warren Speed with contributions from Seymour Mace and O'Brien. Speed, Victoria Hopkins, and Christian Steel star as a group of circus freaks who must combat zombies and cultists while trying to rescue a captive.  Plot  Johnny Hellfire, Pervo the Clown, Zeus, and Damage the strongman are a circus freak troupe on a promotional tour along with a goth group fronted by Skye Brannigan, whose sister Rachel has gone missing. Along the way, they appear on a show hosted by Tycho Zander, who also leads a sex cult consisting of kidnapped scantily clad girls who are kept hypnotized and drugged. As a result the girls are also very willing subjects in experiments conducted by Tycho's father Henry, an evil scientist who loves keeping the lingerie clad girls strapped down to an operating table in his lab. He accidentally transforms the women in Tycho's cult into zombies, and they attack. The circus freaks must stop the zombies, confront Tycho and the lunatic scientist Henry and rescue Rachel before she becomes the next victim on Henry's operating table.  Cast   Production  Zombie Women of Satan was shot in Newcastle and Gateshead in 2009 for £70,000.  Release  The premiere was at the 2009 London FrightFest Film Festival. Supermarkets in the UK refused to stock the DVD due to its lurid title. Revolver Entertainment released it on DVD in the UK on 21 June 2010. Screen Media Films released it on DVD in the US on 29 March 2011.  Reception  Ian Berriman of SFX rated it 1/5 stars and compared it negatively to amateur porn. Berriman concluded that it is \\"dull and ugly\\", suited only as propaganda against decadent Western culture. Jeremy Blitz of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"Zombie Women of Satan provides sporadic fun, lots of blood and gore, and even more bare female flesh. But that's about it. The jokes fall flat as often as they work, the story is pretty incomprehensible and there are few really likeable characters.\\" Marc Patterson of Brutal As Hell called it \\"a lowbrow, craptastic good time, exploding with cheap gore gags and bountiful nudity.\\" Peter Dendle wrote, \\"The movie is adolescent in tone and content, and the zombies are played mostly for visual objectification and batting practice.\\"  Sequel  Warren Speed and Chris Greenwood shot a sequel, Zombie Women of Satan 2, in 2013. It stars Speed, Pete Bennett and Michael Fielding amongst others, and was finally released worldwide in 2018. In America it was renamed \\"Female Zombie Riot\\".

She is the author of more than 25 award-winning books.  Early life  Virginia Leland Evarts was born in San Diego to Dorothea Abbott Evarts, an artist and teacher, and Hal G. Evarts, Jr., an author of many western books, stories for the Saturday Evening Post, biographies, and adventure titles for young readers. Her maternal grandfather, Clinton Gilbert Abbott, was the director of the San Diego Natural History Museum and her paternal grandfather, Hal G. Evarts, was an author of western novels in the 1920s and 1930s. She and her two younger brothers camped with their family in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, explored Baja California, and traveled throughout the Western United States while their father conducted research for his writing. She spent three summers on a ranch and made a six-week bicycle trip from San Diego to Canada with her Girl Scout troop. Wadsworth graduated from La Jolla High School, and attended the University of California Davis where she graduated with an English degree and minor in Western American History.\\"UC Davis brings children’s books, authors into classrooms\\".

When her children were in elementary school, she began submitting articles to magazines, including Cobblestone (magazine), and had many articles published. Some of her biographies were expansions of those published articles. Her first published book was a 1990 biography of Julia Morgan, a California architect and first woman to win the American Institute of Architects' AIA Gold Medal. John Muir, Rachel Carson, John Burroughs, and Laura Ingalls Wilder were among her early biography subjects. She wrote about Susan Butcher and her dogs who won the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Alaska four times. She then wrote a series about animal habitats and another about animal homes. More biographies followed, including ones about Annie Oakley, Benjamin Banneker, Cesar Chavez, and the Wright Brothers. Wadsworth's more recent books include the true story of John Muir and Theodore Roosevelt camping together in Yosemite in 1903, a biography of Juliette Gordon Low the founder of Girl Scouts of the USA,\\"Young readers’ (nonrequired) summer books list\\".

Livelihood Supports  With a scene of devastation everywhere in a little town of northern China in 1937, Dr. J. Calvitt Clarke, a foreign Presbyterian minister, tried to contribute himself to save more orphans and homelessness away from the war. After he went back the States, he called for the public’s attention and established the China’s Children Fund (abbreviated as CCF) in Richmond, Virginia, USA. Through one-on- one sponsorship program, the sponsors contributed a fixed amount on a regular basis to help with children in need. Even after TFCF’s independence, they still insist to carry on this concept in order to help their sponsored children become self-reliant. TFCF provides them with livelihood supports as well as an opportunity to continue their education through sponsorship program, scholarship, emergency relief fund, life care, nutrition program and Self-Reliant Program for Youth. (1) Sponsorship Program The sponsorship program is designed to assist the children and families in dire need. TFCF has started their Family Sponsorship Program for needy children and families since 2008. In total, TFCF has helped 183,047 children and youths become self- reliant. (2) Scholarships and Student Aids Several types of scholarships and student financial aids are given to the sponsored children and/or their siblings for encouraging them to continue schooling and prevent them from dropping out of schools due to financial difficulties. (3) Emergency Relief Fund Emergency Relief Fund is distributed when their assisted families encountering any financial difficulties. In total, the accumulated amount has reached NT$23,546,891. (4) Life Care TFCF provides social resources and volunteers to help low-income families to get through hard times. The services include financial/ in kind assistance, house care, household duties, day care and foster care. (5) Nutrition Program TFCF has provided Nutrition Program to the children from pre-school to high school since Sept. 2009. 1. Grant for meals at school: It includes the three meals. 2. Supplement: It includes milk powder (for age 3-6) and UHT milk. 3. Grant for age 0-3: The milk powder for the child under age 3 should be purchased with caution. With the receipt, the social worker could apply for the grant on behalf of the parents. The grant is distributed based on the age and the limitation. (6) Self-Reliant Program for Youth TFCF has developed the “Self-Reliant Program for Youth” since 2008, including career planning, interpersonal relationship, financial management, vocational consultation, leadership training and camping scheme. Through this program, they help the youth become self-reliant and be able to devote themselves to benefiting the needy children and families in the future.

By the age of sixteen he was on his own, cowboying in Texas and working as a buffalo hunter in Kansas. By his late twenties, Ben was at Camp Carlin, Wyoming, where he was convicted of stealing army mules and sentenced to three years and six months. On November 20, 1879, Ben Daniels entered the Wyoming Territorial Penitentiary as Convict No. 88.Cheyenne Daily Leader, November 20, 21, 23, 1879 and Laramie Sentinel, November 21, 22, 1879. = Dodge City = Ben Daniels was released from prison on August 28, 1883.Frye, Elnora L. Atlas of Wyoming Outlaws at the Territorial Penitentiary. Laramie, WY, 1990. He headed for Dodge City, where he cultivated the friendship of Bat Masterson and Bill Tilghman. When City Marshal Tilghman's assistant marshal, Tom Nixon, was killed by \\"Mysterious Dave\\" Mather, Tilghman recommended Ben Daniels as a suitable replacement. Ben was duly appointed on July 24, 1884 at a salary of $100 a month.Dodge City Democrat, August 9, 1884. Daniels' term as assistant marshal expired on April 10, 1886.Globe Live Stock Journal (Dodge City), April 13, 1886. He then opened the Green Front Saloon in Dodge City. Ed Julian, the owner of a restaurant next door to the Green Front, began complaining about the noise and rowdy behavior emanating from Daniels' saloon. On April 15, 1886 Daniels was ordered by town officials to close his saloon. He immediately went looking for Julian, and when he spotted him he shot him in the back. The evidence clearly pointed to the shooting being murder, but Daniels was acquitted. Following the verdict, Daniels moved on. = Marriage = Ben Daniels married Annie Laura \\"Annie\\" Broaddus at Blue Springs, Missouri on March 6, 1887. Both the marriage license and certificate listed the applicants as \\"Benjamin F. Daniels, 34 years of age, Dodge City, Kansas\\" and \\"Anna L. Broaddus, age 28, of Blue Springs, Missouri.\\"Missouri Marriage Records, 1805–2002. Missouri State Archives, Jefferson City, Missouri. The newlyweds moved to Lamar, Bent County, Colorado where Ben accepted an appointment as deputy sheriff of Bent County during January 1888. = Gray County War = In the late 1880s, Ben became involved in the Gray County War, which was a dispute over the location of the Gray County seat in western Kansas. Ben was one of the lawmen who participated in the gunfight in Cimarron on January 12, 1889. At least one man was killed during the fighting and seven others wounded. Ben and a few of his partners shot their way out of town while the remaining four were besieged and eventually forced to surrender by the people of Cimarron, who had the lawmen surrounded in the Old Gray County Courthouse.DeArment, Robert K. Ballots and Bullets: The Bloody County Seat Wars of Kansas, pp. 56–65 During 1893 Ben Daniels and his wife moved to the new boomtown of Cripple Creek, Colorado where he pursued his gambling interests and performed occasional service as a lawman. = Rough Riders = When the Spanish–American War broke out, 46-year- old Ben Daniels enlisted in Troop K of the First Volunteer U.S. Cavalry—better known as \\"The Rough Riders.\\" Ben was still living in Cripple Creek, where the local paper reported that \\"Ben Daniels left last night for San Antonio, Tex. He goes as Cripple Creek's contribution to 'Teddy's Terrors', \\" the cowboy regiment raised by [Leonard}] Wood and Roosevelt ...\\"Cripple Creek (Colorado) Morning Times, May 17, 1898. Ben Daniels was remembered well by Lt. Col. Theodore Roosevelt, who recalled in his 1899 book The Rough Riders: > Some of our best recruits came from Colorado. One, a very large, hawk-eyed > man, Benjamin Franklin Daniels, had been Marshal [sic] of Dodge City when > that pleasing town was probably the toughest abode of civilized man to be > found anywhere on the continent. In the course of his rather lurid functions > as peace officer he had lost half of one ear—'bitten off,' as it was > explained to me. Naturally he viewed the dangers of battle with philosophic > calm. Such a man was, in reality, a veteran even in his first fight, and was > a tower of strength to the recruits in his part of the line.Roosevelt, > Theodore. The Rough Riders (1899). Most recently published in an illustrated > edition by the Fall River Press, New York, 2014. . Ben Daniels survived San Juan Hill, and the more-deadly malaria-carrying mosquitoes to return to the states as a hero of what had been termed as a \\"Splendid Little War.\\" Ben was present at Camp Wikoff, Long Island, New York on September 15, 1898 when Theodore Roosevelt and his \\"Rough Riders\\" were officially mustered out. = United States Marshal for the Territory of Arizona (first appointment) = After being mustered out of the Rough Riders, Daniels began what would become a 20-year correspondence with Theodore Roosevelt. After Roosevelt's ascension to the presidency in September, 1901 Daniels began asking if the president could provide him with some sort of employment. On January 8, 1902 President Roosevelt appointed Ben Daniels as United States Marshal for the Territory of Arizona. That appointment was subject to confirmation by a majority of the United States Senate. Daniels appointment was confirmed by the senate on January 30, 1902. Within a week, Daniels appointment was called into question. Somehow, one of the people who had been opposed to Daniels' appointment had found out about Ben's prison record in Wyoming, and contacted the Attorney General of the United States. The story of his prison term had also been leaked to the press. The telegrams and letters poured into the White House. These missives either damned him as a gambler, mule thief and murderer or praised him as a peace officer and war hero. The pressure finally became too much for the Roosevelt White House. Ben Daniels submitted his resignation on February 25, 1902.Colorado Transcript (Golden, Colorado), February 26, 1902. = Superintendent of Yuma Territorial Penitentiary = Angered by the public outcry, President Roosevelt remained determined to do something for Ben Daniels – something that wouldn't require senate confirmation to get one of his favorite Rough Riders on the Federal payroll, Accordingly, the President had another former \\"Rough Rider,\\" Governor Alexander Oswald Brodie of Arizona, appoint Daniels as Superintendent of the Territorial Penitentiary at Yuma on October 1, 1904. In a note to his close friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, President Roosevelt bragged: \\"By the way, I think it will rejoice your heart to know that Governor Brodie of Arizona (late Lieutenant-Colonel of the Rough Riders) is going to appoint Ben Daniels (late one-eared hero of that organization) as warden of the Arizona Penitentiary. When I told this to John Hay he remarked (with brutal absence of feeling) that he believed the proverb ran: 'Set a Rough Rider to catch a thief!'\\"President Theodore Roosevelt to Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, June 4, 1904. Theodore Roosevelt Correspondence, Widener Library, Harvard University. = United States Marshal for the Territory of Arizona (second appointment) = After three years, the scandal caused by Theodore Roosevelt's first attempt to appoint Ben Daniels as U.S. Marshal for Arizona had largely been forgotten. President Roosevelt decided to try a second time, and this time he made it. On July 1, 1905 Ben Daniels was finally appointed, with the advice and consent of the Senate, as the United States Marshal for the Territory of Arizona. On August 26, 1906 Ben's wife, Annie Laura Daniels, died suddenly while visiting Ben's older sister, Elizabeth (Daniels) Copple in Emporia, Kansas.Emporia Gazette, August 27, 1906. Annie Laura Daniels was buried at the cemetery in her family's home town of Blue Springs, Missouri.Daniels would not remain a widower for long. On July 15, 1908 Ben married for a second time. His new wife was a 39-year-old widow named Anna Evaline (Stakebake) Seayrs.Marriage Certificate, Pima County, Arizona. Benjamin F. Daniels and Eva Stakebake Seayrs, July 15, 1908. His new bride, who preferred to be called \\"Eva\\" was a schoolteacher who had a 10 year-old daughter by her first marriage.Anna Evaline \\"Eva\\" Stakebake was born in 1869 in Indiana. Her first husband, Hampton Seayrs, died in 1907. They had a daughter born in 1898, who died at the age of 16, when Ben Daniels was her step-father. Anna Evaline Stakebake Daniels had survived her husband by nearly 23 years, when she died at the age of 76 on March 23, 1946. After President Theodore Roosevelt left office in 1909, Ben Daniels was called to Washington and asked to resign his commission as U.S. Marshal for the Territory of Arizona. While there, he was offered the position of Indian Agent at the Menominee Indian Agency in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Daniels turned the offer down and returned to mining properties that he had in Arizona. = Final years = During 1914, at the age of sixty- two, Ben Daniels ran on Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party ticket for sheriff of Pima County, Arizona and finished a very bad third. Two years later, again running on the Progressive ticket, Daniels was again defeated for office. After this second defeat, Ben followed the example of Theodore Roosevelt and rejoined the Republican Party that Roosevelt had bolted in 1912. As a Republican, in 1920, Ben finally was elected sheriff of Pima County, during which time he engaged in a handful of final adventures as a lawman. In May 1922, Daniels and his deputies investigated the robbery of the Golden State Limited outside of Tucson and helped bring several of the culprits to justice in what was to be the last true train robbery in Arizona. Later that year, Daniels was defeated in a bid for re-election. The 70-year-old Daniels quietly went back to working his mining claims.Dolan, Samuel K., Cowboys and Gangsters: Stories of an Untamed Southwest (TwoDot Books, 2016) Ben Daniels died at 1:30 in the afternoon of April 20, 1923. He suffered a massive heart attack while he was seated in his parked automobile in Tucson. He died within the hour.Arizona Daily Star (Tucson), April 21, 1923. Funeral services were conducted from Daniels' residence at 628 Ninth Avenue in Tucson. Burial was at Evergreen Cemetery.  Bibliography  * DeArment, Robert K.

Woodley Losack was born on 5 October 1769 in Basseterre, Saint Kitts. His father Richard was appointed the Lieutenant Governor of the Leeward Islands. His brother George Losack preceded him into the Royal Navy and rose to the rank of admiral. Early naval career The cutting out of a French Brig, possibly La Chevrette As a lieutenant, Losack served on , the flagship of Admiral William Cornwallis, and participated in the enterprise to cut out la Chevrette, a French corvette, of 20 nine-pounders and 350 men, from under the batteries in Camaret Bay, near Brest, on the night of 21 July 1801. Lieutenant Losack and Lieutenant Keith Maxwell were promoted to the rank of commander for their services in this enterprise. In 1801 he was appointed captain and held the temporary command of the 36-gun fifth rate HMS Jason (1800) in the spring of 1801. On 1 May 1801 the Jason captured la Dorade, a brig privateer of 14 guns and 51 men. Later that year he was appointed Captain of HMS Helena (1804), an 18-gun sloop. On 5 June 1805 the Helena captured the Santa Leocadia, a Spanish privateer of 14 guns and 114 men. Post-captain Losack was made post-captain on 22 January 1806. In 1807 he was appointed Captain of the second rate ship of the line . Following the concern in Britain that neutral Denmark was entering an alliance with Napoleon, the Prince George sailed in the squadron in the expedition to occupy the Danish West Indies, with the squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, who sailed in . The squadron, which included , , and , captured the Telemaco, Carvalho and Master on 17 April 1807. The Battle of Tamatave Battle of Tamatave (Action of 20 May 1811) From 7 September 1810 to July 1814 he was Captain of the fifth rate . On 20 May 1811 he took part in the Battle of Tamatave between a squadron, under the command of Captain Charles Marsh Schomberg, which comprised three English frigates (HMS Galatea, and ), and the brig-sloop , and three French vessels of superior force (Renommée, Clorinde and Néréide). The action marked the end of the final French attempt to operate in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars. The surviving participants in the battle qualified for the Naval General Service Medal, which was awarded in 1847 with clasp \\"Off Tamatave 20 May 1811\\". There were recriminations among the British squadron, Schomberg praising Astraea and Phoebe but omitting Racehorse and Galatea from the recommendations in his post-battle report. Captain Losack was particularly offended as Schomberg had implied that Galatea's distress signal that was flown during the battle was an overreaction in the face of the enemy, despite her casualties being greater than the rest of the squadron combined. He subsequently requested a court martial to clear any suggestion of cowardice from his name but the Admiralty refused, commenting that they were fully satisfied with his conduct. Historian William James claims that opinion within the Navy was also with Losack and that Schomberg had been excessively harsh in his criticism.

He died in the Sobibor extermination camp.Max van Dam in the Digital Monument of the Jewish Community in the Netherlands Early life ( -1931) Max van Dam was the son of Aron van Dam and Johanna van Dam née Leviticus. Both his parents were Jewish. He grew up in a socialist environment. His father was a certified meat inspector who became the director of the cooperative store De Dageraad, literal translation The Dawn, in Winterswijk, where he had a seat on the town council for the Dutch Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP). Van Dam showed an early interest in art, drawing portraits and painting landscapes, and although his father did not encourage an artistic career he did provide Van Dam with early painting commissions. Between 1922 and 1929 Van Dam attended the Rijks Hogere Burgerschool in Winterswijk. His artistic inspirations at the time include Vincent van Gogh and Käthe Kollwitz. It is at this time that his artistic talents and ambitions are noticed by family friend and Max van Dam's lifelong benefactor Dr. Jacob “Jaap” Hemelrijk, who persuaded his father to allow Van Dam to pursue an education in the arts.Wim Scholtz Uit een Rood Nest in Wim Scholtz (ed.) et al (1986) Max van Dam Joods Kunstenaar 1910 – 1943Biography Aron van Dam in het biografisch woordenboek van het socialisme en de arbeidsbeweging in Nederland Art education (1931-1937) To continue his education Van Dam moved to Amsterdam where he first studied to become a grammar school art teacher. Upon completion of the degree, in 1931, he did not take a teaching position but instead enrolled in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, where he took courses from 1933 to 1937. Here he specialised in portraiture and studied under Isodoor Opsomer. In this period his life evolved against the background of the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany and the associated anti-semitism, a growing concern of Van Dam and his acquaintances. Van Dam primarily lived in Antwerp but moved frequently between the Netherlands and Belgium and also travelled to Italy and France, to develop his painting skills and improve on his social awareness. In 1932 van Dam designed a stained-glass window for De Dageraad, the work was finished in 1934. That same year he designed the poster for the Demonstration for Socialism and Democracy, organised, for September 16, by the SDAP and the Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen, the Dutch Association of Trade Unions. In 1936 and 1937 he was a frequent guest of Jaap Hemelrijk and his family, in Bergen, where he met graphic artist Fré Cohen and painters Leo Gestel, Charley Toorop and Matthieu Wiegman associated with the Bergen School. His interest in zionism increased and he accepted a commission to paint a portrait of Theodor Herzl. In spite of growing recognition van Dam had a difficult time earning a living as an artist. Between 1933 and 1937 he applied for and was one of the recipients of, the Koninklijke Subsidie voor Vrije Schilderkunst, the Royal Subsidy for painting, awarded annually since 1871, to encourage young painters.Edna Heruthy-Waivisz Onze Vriend Max van Dam in Wim Scholtz (ed.) et al (1986) Max van Dam Joods Kunstenaar 1910 – 1943Max van Dam at the Netherlands Institute for Art History in The Hague. Towards the end of his period at the Royal Academy the relationship with Opsomer deteriorated due to stylistic and personal disagreements and Van Dam returned to Amsterdam, resolved to prepare a submission for the ‘’Prix de Rome’’, an encouragement prize for young artists. He was awarded the silver medal for his entry, a painting of ‘’Hagar and Ishmael’’, in 1938. In the period he continued to struggle to support himself and managed a meagre existence from his painting sales, commission work and the occasional prize money won in other contest exhibitions, such as the prize from the artist society Arti et Amicitiae of which he was a member. He also received encouragement and financial support from benefactors and expanded his circle of acquaintances among Dutch artists and connoisseurs as his own recognition as an artist grew. The art collectors Hans de Jong, a textile manufacturer from Hengelo, and his wife Alice de Jong- Weil, were among the customers for his portraits with whom he established friendly relations. Under Nazi occupation (1940-1943) After the May 10, 1940 invasion and occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi German forces, Van Dam initially continued to work as before but, as anti-Jewish measures increased throughout 1941, he went into hiding in Blaricum, where he continued to work. He attempted to escape and managed to reach Vichy France but returned to the Netherlands several months later in an effort to attempt an escape with Alice Weil and her daughter, Jacqueline de Jong, to Weil's native Switzerland. In the autumn of 1942 they managed to reach the French Alps but were arrested as a result of betrayal. Van Dam was taken to the Drancy internment camp. During his incarceration there he was able to paint and created prints from engravings which he sent to Alice Weil, who had managed to escape to Switzerland shortly after their arrest. She later donated two of these works to the Ghetto Fighters' House and Yad Vashem.Jules Schelvis Sobibor in Wim Scholtz (ed.) et al (1986) Max van Dam Joods Kunstenaar 1910 – 1943 Sobibor, death (1943) On March 25, 1943, he was deported on transport 53 from Drancy to the Sobibor extermination camp. Upon arrival in Sobibor he was among the skilled workers selected while the remainder of the deportees were gassed or shot. Van Dam was set up in an atelier for craftsmen where he created paintings for the camp staff. Sobibor survivor Kurt Ticho, who had befriended Van Dam in the camp, later recalled that deputy camp commander SS- Oberscharführer (Staff Sergeant) Gustav Wagner had ordered Van Dam to paint him based on the image on a postcard. Ticho testified during the Sobibor trial in Hagen that van Dam had painted portraits for the SS. Another survivor, Ursula Stern, mentioned in her post-war statements that Heinrich Himmler had posed for a portrait by Van Dam on an inspection tour of the extermination camp and its gassing operations. In the craftsmen's workshop Van Dam worked alongside Li van Staden, Moshe Goldfarb and the surviving gold smith Stanislaw Szmajzner. During much of his time in the camp Van Dam had a privileged position. When approximately 70 Dutch men assigned to slave-labour in the camp were murdered, following a betrayed escape attempt, he was exempt from these reprisal killings. SS-Oberscharführer Karl Frenzel stated in 1983 that he had kept one of the paintings by Van Dam but that his family had destroyed it, and everything else that connected Frenzel with the camps, after his 1962 arrest. He further stated that Van Dam had been killed in the revolt and that the paintings in Sobibor's staff quarters had been destroyed at the same time. The details and exact date of Van Dam's death remain unclear. Survivors have indicated that he was killed shortly after completing his last painting commission, in September 1943. Jules Schelvis notes, that Frenzel's assertion that Van Dam was killed in the revolt may have been self-serving. Schelvis concluded this based on statements by Alexander Pechersky, who was emphatic in his declarations never to have met Van Dam because the painter had already been killed prior to his own arrival in Sobibor, on September 23, 1943.Kurt Ticho, My Legacy, page 82Thomas Blatt, The Forgotten Revolt pages 48, 62Ursula Stern, NIOD Toegang 804, Inventaris 18, page 266ffJules Schelvis, Vernietigingskamp Sobibor (5th Ed. 2004), pages 105, 111, 112, 327 His father, Aron van Dam, mother Johanna van Dam née Leviticus and youngest sister, Henrietta van Dam, died in Auschwitz in 1942.

In 1966 the first posthumous solo exhibition was held in, Goois Museum. Roosen includes a quotation from Jan Koenraads who wrote in Het Vrije Volk on May 12, 1966: \\"All his works breathe sensitivity, composure and a longing for pure aestethics.\\" Roosen writes that Koenraads had described, in a review published in Elsevier two days later, \\"\\"The exhibition had given him a sour sensation because in civilised Europe\\" it had been possible for a budding painter \\"to be torn off as a branch from a tree.\\"\\" Roosen also notes that a still life by Van Dam from the collection of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam was included in the exhibition commemorating Jewish Artists who perished in the Holocaust, held in Tel Aviv, in 1968, on the twentieth anniversary of Israel. Works by van Dam have been acquired by the municipal government of his home town of Winterswijk and remain on display in public buildings and in the museum in the town, which has also occasionally hosted retrospective exhibitions of his artwork. The Joods Historisch Museum, Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam has a large collection of Van Dam's works, in different media, including a self-portrait Van Dam painted, oil on canvas, in 1935/1936, showing the artist, en face, at 25 years of age.Max van Dam, Self Portrait (1935, 1936) in the collection of the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam.

Founded in 2012, sf.citi advocates policies that offer innovative solutions to historic problems facing San Francisco. sf.citi’s work falls into three primary categories: political advocacy (represent), corporate social responsibility (engage), and events with the broader San Francisco community (convene).http://www.sfciti.org sf.citi is a member-based organization whose membership consists of tech companies headquartered in San Francisco, including Airbnb, Facebook, Google, Lyft and Salesforce.http://www.sfciti.org/membership __TOC__ Board of Directors The sf.citi Board of Directorshttps://sfciti.org/about-us/#board includes representatives from San Francisco’s technology and business/nonprofit industries. They work closely with the sf.citi team in directing sf.citi’s policy agenda and organizational development. =Current Board of Directors= Ron Conway, Founder of SV Angel, serves as the Board Chair on the sf.citi Board of Directors. Kate O’Sullivan, General Manager of Industry and External Affairs in the Corporate, External and Legal Affairs Department within Microsoft, serves as the Vice Board Chair on the sf.citi Board of Directors. The other sf.citi Board members include the following: * Vikrum Aiyer, Vice President of Global Public Policy and Strategic Communications at Postmates * Dillon Auyoung, Director of Government Affairs at Comcast * Cammy Blackstone, Director of External Affairs in San Francisco for AT%26T * Rob Grant, Vice President of Government Affairs at Cruise Automation * Jim Green, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs and Public Policy at Salesforce * Michael Matthews, California Director of Public Policy at Facebook * Rebecca Prozan, Senior Manager of Government Affairs and Public Policy for Google * Steve Sarner, Vice President Ad Sales and Program Management at Goodreads (Amazon) =Emeritus sf.citi Board Members= The following previously served on the sf.citi Board of Directors: * Amy Banse, Managing Director and Head of Funds for Comcast Ventures * Marc Blakeman, Vice President of External Affairs for AT%26T * Kimberly Bryant, Founder and Executive Director of Black Girls Code * Carmela Clendening, former Director of State and Local Government Affairs at Salesforce * Regina Evans, Senior Director of Government Affairs at Comcast * Jared Friedman, Partner at Y Combinator and co-founder and CTO of Scribd * Heather Harde, former CEO of TechCrunch * Burke Norton, Principal at Vista Equity Partners * Hosain Rahman, Founder and CEO of Jawbone Health Advocacy =Prop E= sf.citi lobbied for the passage of Proposition E - San Francisco Gross Receipts Tax on Businesses on the November 2012 San Francisco ballot. Passing with 71% of the public vote, Proposition E phased out the city’s payroll tax over five years and replaced it with a gross receipts tax for businesses in selected revenue brackets.https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco_Gross_Receipts_Tax_on_Businesses,_Proposition_E_(November_2012) Many of the city’s business advocates and tech companies claimed that the city’s payroll tax was a deterrent to job growth. Proposition E would shift the tax burden from 10% to 90% of San Francisco’s businesses and generate an estimated $28.5 million in annual revenue to the city.https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco_Gross_Receipts_Tax_on_Businesses,_Proposition_E_(November_2012) Among its advocacy efforts in favor of Proposition E, sf.citi circulated a video for Yes on E. The video featured Twitter chairman Jack Dorsey, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, and Twitter and Obvious Corp. co-founder Biz Stone. The video was featured on Youtube’s homepage. =Tech Shuttle Buses= In 2014, sf.citi became involved in San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency's (SFMTA) pilot shuttle program. The program allowed tech companies to transport employees to and from San Francisco and their corporate campuses in Silicon Valley via shuttle buses. In response to opposition, sf.citi organized its members and supporters to attend key Board of Supervisors meetings and send letters to their Supervisors in support of the shuttles. In 2017, the SFMTA Board of Directors voted unanimously to make the Commuter Shuttle Program permanent.https://sfciti.org/represent/ =Tech Tax= In the summer of 2016, sf.citi coordinated a group of business and tech leaders, including Google and Salesforce, to challenge District 1 Supervisor Eric Mar’s “Tech Tax” – a ballot measure that would impose a 1.5% payroll tax on tech companies in San Francisco with gross receipts over $1 million. The proposed measure did not make it out of committee. On August 1 2016, the ballot measure lost in a 2-1 vote during a Budget and Finance Committee hearing, with both District 2 and District 4 Supervisors Mark Farrell and Katy Tang voting to table it. =Sidewalk Delivery Robots= In 2017, District 7 Supervisor Norman Yee proposed legislation to prohibit autonomous delivery devices on San Francisco sidewalks, citing concerns around pedestrian safety. sf.citi pushed back against the proposed ordinance, advocating for a compromise between the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and the tech companies that would be affected by the ban. The initial ordinance was sent back to committee three times for amendments over the course of almost a year.http://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/player/clip/30002?view_id=10 Instead of an outright ban on all sidewalk delivery robots, the Board of Supervisors agreed, at the end of 2017, to develop a permit process allowing select companies to test courrier bots around the city. The permits went into effect in March of 2018. =Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work= In 2017, District 6 Supervisor Jane Kim pushed for a “robot tax” by launching a statewide campaign called Jobs of the Future Fund. Kim proposed extending a payroll tax to robots that “perform jobs humans currently do.” Revenue generated from the tax would fund workforce development programs for workers displaced by automation. In response to Kim’s campaign, sf.citi released a report, “Taxing Innovation: The Challenge of Regulating Job Automation,” which aggregated research on automation and the future of work.https://sfciti.org/bigideas/ The paper concluded that “[r]obots will change the way we work, but they can’t replace us.”https://sfciti.org/bigideas/ The sf.citi report also offered three recommendations for legislators to consider as they explore future regulation around automation. A “robot tax” has not been carried forward at either the state or local level. =Government Broadband Network= In early 2017, the late Mayor Ed Lee and his interim successor, Mayor Mark Farrell, commissioned a report outlining how the City of San Francisco could develop a citywide network to provide fiber-based Internet service to all San Francisco residents. Intended to bridge the digital divide with some 100,000 San Franciscans without home internet, the proposal was estimated to cost the city between $1.9 and $2.5 billion. At a hearing in May 2018, sf.citi argued that, while “well-intentioned,” homelessness and housing are more urgent issues for San Francisco. Mayor Farrell did not pursue a revenue initiative for the project on the November 2018 ballot. Since he was replaced by Mayor London Breed in the June 2018 election, the Request for Proposals needed to implement the city-run internet service, was put on hold as the city conducts further research. Corporate Social Responsibility sf.citi leads two corporate social responsibility programs, Circle the Schools and Future Grads, which connect San Francisco-based companies and the community around them. =Circle the Schools= Circle the Schools is an initiative started by sf.citi in collaboration with the San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Education Fund, that engages local companies to partner with and “adopt” San Francisco public schools. The purported goal of these evolunteer partnerships is to ensure that the future workforce will have the necessary skills, experience, and resources needed to thrive. To date, Circle the Schools companies have circled 65 schools, provided over 21,092 volunteer hours, and donated over $803,035 in resources.https://sfciti.org/about- us/#2018AnnualReport =Future Grads= Created by sf.citi, the Future Graduates program is a partnership with the San Francisco Police Foundation that offers high-school students in San Francisco an eight-week paid internship at a local nonprofit or tech company.https://sfciti.org/what-we- do/future-grads/ One City Forum sf.citi’s One City Forum is a quarterly event series aimed at uniting various sectors in tackling important challenges facing San Francisco. Launched in 2016, the One City Forum allows the tech community to engage with local nonprofits and community leaders on issues affecting both the Bay Area and the tech industry at large. Past events have included “The Case for Corporate Social Responsibility,” “The Techies Project Launch Party,” “Tech Votes,”,“One City Standing Together” and “We Are San Francisco”.https://sfciti.org/onecityforum/ The One City Forum is composed of nine volunteer members–four senior leadership representatives from the tech industry and five senior leadership representatives from a local nonprofit. The Forum members meet regularly to discuss difficult issues facing San Franciscans and plan events that further those discussions, as well as build partnerships between tech and the broader community. Sherilyn Adams, Executive Director of Larkin Street Youth Services and Tiffany Apczynski, Vice President of Public Policy and Social Impact at Zendesk, are the current One City Forum co-chairs. Other Forum members include Erin Felter, Executive Director of Okta for Good, Katie Ferrick, Director of Community Affairs at LinkedIn, Charlie Hale, Head of Global Public Policy & Social Impact at Pinterest, Amy Lebold, VP HR & Recruiting and Head of People at AdRoll Inc., Ashley McCumber, CEO of Meals on Wheels San Francisco, Tomiquia Moss, CEO of Hamilton Families, and Abby Snay, CEO of Jewish Vocational Service.https://sfciti.org/onecityforum/ References External links *sf.citi official website Category:Organizations based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States ","title":"Sf.citi"},{"id":"42377345","text":"Virbia semirosea is a moth in the family Erebidae first described by Herbert Druce in 1889.

On August 14, 1937, the 4th Air Force Group commanded by Gao shot down six Japanese planes over Jianqiao, while suffering zero losses. Subsequently, Gao became a Chinese war hero.  Early life  Gao was born in Tonghua County of Liaoning Province into a Roman Catholic family on May 14, 1907. He was the eldest of six siblings. Gao was admitted into the Education Class of the Northeast Army Officers as an artillery cadet. He was selected to receive flight training in France in the following year. Gao returned to China in 1927 and was posted to the Flying Eagle Squadron of the Northeast Army under Marshal Zhang Zuolin and became a flight instructor in 1929. When the Japanese invaded Manchuria on 18 September 1931, he went south to join the Central Government and became an instructor in the Central Flying School near Hangchou. After returning from Italy after an inspection tour, he was made Deputy Chief of Instruction, and commander of the 4th Pursuit Group.  Air battles  = Battle of Shanghai = While Chinese intelligence reported a number of Japanese bombers having taken off from an airfield in Taiwan on 14 August, 1937, crossing the Formosa Straits on a northernly heading in the direction of Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, the incoming raid was detected and sounded by the Chinese air raid warning network. These were the 18 Imperial Japanese Navy G3M bombers of the Kanoya Kokutai; 9 led by Lieutenant Commander Nitta to attack Jianqiao Airbase, and 9 led by Lt. Cmdr. Asano to attack Guangde Airbase. As soon as reports of the approach of the bombers at an altitude of four thousand meters came in, the pilots of the 4th Pursuit Group led by Colonel Gao ascended through the clouds, and found the sleek twin-engined G3M bombers in loose formation. Gao Zhihang pinpointed a G3M bomber, closing in and first focusing his aim at the machine-gunner in the pop-up turret, silencing the gunner, and the riddling the left engine with bullets until it erupted in fire, and sending it crashing down in flames in the town of Banshan by Jianqiao airfield. This was the first official victory for the Chinese Air Force against the invading Japanese air power. At least three more G3Ms were claimed by other pilots of the 4th PG, some shared, including that of Maj. Li Guidan, Capt. Liu Zhesheng, Capt. Zheng Shaoyu, et al. Colonel Gao's victory was widely publicized and gave him a patriotic hero status in the news around the country; the 4th PG led by Gao Zhihang was officially named the \\"Zhihang Group\\". The following day, Col. Gao led 21 Hawk IIIs on an early morning combat air patrol when they encountered 12 B2M attack bombers from the IJN fleet aircraft carrier Kaga on approach to Jianqiao, and in the confusing melee through the clouds over Hangzhou Bay, Col. Gao's pilots claimed 17 of the B2Ms shot down, when in fact 11 of the 12 were shot down without loss to the Chinese, except for a serious injury that Col. Gao received from the machine gun fire of the B2M which he shot down, which would put him out of action for almost two months.https://www.jasve.com/junshi/cacdf16da4a697cc99e82f55b7c1cc08.html https://usnwcarchives.org/repositories/2/archival_objects/58526 = Defense of Nanking = After almost two months of recovery from injuries sustained from gunfire in the attack against Japanese B2M attack planes from aircraft carrier Kaga over Hangzhou Bay in August, Colonel Gao sought to boost morale and improve the dogfighting performance of the Hawk IIIs. While on the shakedown of his airmen, he had his maintenance crews remove the bomb-racks, fuel tank cowlings, landing lighting equipment, etc. On October 12, 1937, he led an aggressive search-and-destroy mission consisting of six Hawk IIIs, two Boeing P-26/281s \\"Peashooters\\" and a Fiat CR.32 against any Japanese fighter aircraft approaching Nanking airspace. As they've expected, a group of Mitsubishi A5Ms was caught entering Nanking airspace, and in the ensuing fray, Major John Wong Pan-yang, a Chinese-American volunteer pilot from Seattle, flying a P-26 \\"Peashooter\\", drew first blood shooting down the A5M piloted by PO1c Mazazumi Ino. Captain Liu Cuigang shot down another A5M and Colonel Gao scored a double-kill, shooting down two A5Ms including that of shotai leader WO Torakuma. This was a monumental moment of air-superiority exhibited by the Chinese pilots due to the great experience of Col Gao, Maj Wong and Capt Liu in particular, as they were outnumbered and yet so convincingly defeated the Japanese fighter group flying the far-more advanced Mitsubishis. http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_wong1.htm  Death  During October 1937, he was promoted to Commander of Pursuit of the Chinese Air Force, while remaining at the same time as commander of the 4th Group. By November 1937, Colonel Gao's 4th PG had flown to Lanzhou Donggang Airbase where they were re- equipped with the Polikarpov I-16 Type 5, and then leading the second group in their return-flight to Nanjing on 21 November to resume combat operations. While refuelling at Zhoujiakou Airfield, they were caught by some Japanese ten Mitsubishi G3M2s, who evidently were conducting an attack/reconnaissance mission with crucial intelligence reports about the Chinese movements. The bombs were already falling when Kao ran to his I-16. The engine of the fighter wouldn't start and with the bombs falling closer, the ground crew, deciding that discretion was the better part of valour, left the aircraft to take cover. Chasing after them, Gao brought them back at the point of his service revolver to help him start the engine but lost his life when a bomb exploded alongside the aircraft. At the time of his death, Gao had claimed 4 biplane victories, these being claimed while flying the Curtiss Hawk III. According to official record of the Republic of China Air Force he is only credited with 3.5 victories and thus awarded the Three Star Medal.  Legacy  Gao was promoted to Major General posthumously. In 1940, the government announced August 14 would be Air Force Day to raise the morale of the Chinese populace. He was the main character in the 1977 Taiwanese film Heroes of the Eastern Skies and the 2011 Chinese TV series Departed Heroes. He is also featured in the upcoming TV series Eastern Battlefield.

Initially titled Terror Bytes, the film's name was later changed to coincide with a horror website by the same name that Emanuel ran with his co-director Igor Meglic and two other filmmakers. The anthology stars Corbin Bleu and Bill Oberst Jr. and is composed of five interlocking stories set within the city of Los Angeles. Synopsis =The Crossing= Buck (Bill Oberst Jr.) and his friends have made a pastime of trolling the Mexico–United States border in search of anyone they believe to be an illegal immigrant. Upon catching someone, the group murders them and buries the body in the hopes of sending out a personal message to anyone else that wants to enter. However what they couldn't predict is that their victims might rise from the grave to take their revenge. =TaeJung's Lament= A lonely widower finds himself unable to cope with the loss of his wife and begins to follow around various women that resemble her. On one such occasion he ends up becoming a witness to a woman's kidnapping. The man rescues her and in gratitude, the woman urges him to meet her one night. Unknown to him, the woman and her friends are all vampires who are being hunted by Van Helsing himself. =Re-Membered= A dirty cop (Christopher Darga) has been asked to serve as a hitman for a man's murder, which he does. He dismembers the body and stows it in his trunk for later disposal, but is shocked when he begins to find evidence that his victim is somehow still alive. =Clowned= When Emmett (Corbin Bleu), a wayward drug dealer, gets bitten by Fucko (Domiziano Arcangeli), a flesh-eating clown at a family member's birthday party, the last thing he expects is for that bite to begin a horrifying transformation. As his transformation proceeds, Emmett is horrified to find that he has a newly acquired taste for human flesh. =Lover Come Back= A woman returns from the grave in order to seek revenge on the cheating husband who caused her death. As she moves towards her final task, she begins to recollect their relationship and how everything went wrong.

Lore was flown successfully by the well known glider pilot Wolf Hirth at the 1929 Rhön (Wasserkuppe) glider competition. Musterle was used by Hirth used to demonstrate the possibilities of \\"blue sky\\" thermalling for the first time. Design and development Wolf Hirth in his Musterle in 1931 The Akademische Fliegeruppe Darmstadt, founded in 1921, was the first of several Akafliegs associated with German universities intended to give student teams experience of aircraft design. They rapidly acquired a good reputation for inventive glider design. As well as designing and building aircraft as part of their academic programme, they also received some orders from individuals or clubs. These, built in ones or twos, brought welcome funds to the group. In 1928-9 Paul Laubenthal, then at the Akaflieg, designed a Darmstadt sailplane, built by Klemm Leichtflugzeugbau, for the Würtenburger gliding club. This was a development of an earlier Darmstadt glider named after the club. The new machine was named Lore; flown by Wolf Hirth it was one of the most successful competitors at the 1929 Rhön glider contest. Hirth then ordered a copy for himself, built in Kassel, named Musterle. This example became even better known than the original because, with it, Hirth was the first to soar using blue sky thermals, thermals unassociated with cumulus clouds. The two aircraft had similar characteristics though Musterle was about heavier. Musterle was a high, cantilever wing aircraft. Its wing, like the rest of the aircraft was wooden and covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. It was built around a single spar with ply covering from it around the leading edge forming a torsion-resistant D-box. Behind the spar the wing was mostly fabric covered. In plan there was a rectangular centre section that filled about 40% of the span and tapered outer panels tapering to elliptical tips. The ailerons initially filled about 45% of the span and reached the tips, though they were later extended inboard almost to the centre section. Musterle's wing was mounted over the fuselage on a low, ply covered pylon which blended into the fuselage and extended well behind the wing trailing edge, gradually decreasing in height. The fuselage was ply covered and ovoid in cross section, formed by ply covering over three longerons held in transverse frames; it was distinctly pointed on its underside and tapered aft. The cockpit was just ahead of the wing under a removable, largely ply cover; the only transparencies were the windscreen and a small rectangular roof window, though there were open circular portholes on either side. All tail surfaces were built in a similar way to the wing. Both the tall rudder and elevators were all-moving and balanced, with straight edges and rounded tips. The elevators were mounted on top of the fuselage and the rudder extended down to the keel, so a generous cut-out in the elevators was provided for its movement. Musterle had a landing skid under the forward fuselage, reaching back almost to the wing trailing edge, and a spring type tailskid. Operational history In 1930 Hirth took Musterle to the US National Championships held at Harris Hill, New York equipped with a variometer, an instrument unknown outside Germany and previously only used by Robert Kronfeld in the RRG Professor two years earlier. On 5 October he flew a cross country, blue sky thermal flight for the first time. The following spring, on 10 March 1931, he flew over New York using ridge lift from the Hudson River until signalled to come down by police because he was causing a traffic hazard. Flown by different pilots, both Lore and Musterle survived to take part together in the 1934 Rhön competition.

It is located south of the town's market (Rynek), on Chopin Street. During the Partitions of Poland, the building was called the \\"landratura\\", and the adjacent starost's villa was referred to as the Landrat's villa, as Września was then part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Creation Up to the 17th century, the land that now houses the office and adjacent villa was occupied by a cemetery belonging to the Church of the Holy Spirit. After the liquidation of the church, the plot remained neglected and unused for a long time. In 1848, it was purchased by Xavier Stelmachowski, a builder from Września. Two years later, part of the cemetery land was purchased to build the headquarters of the district authorities for Września County, which had been created in 1818. The remainder of the land was purchased in 1911 with the idea of building a landrat's villa. Post-war period Until 1945, the building was used in accordance with its original purpose, namely serving as a district office and apartment for the governor. Since World War II, the building has been overhauled and modernized several times. In 1970, the ground floor of the villa was adapted into a place for weddings. The desk of the Municipal Council is also located in the building; from 1975, the building was also the seat of the Municipal Council. Ever since Września County was re-created in 1999, the building has been restored to its original function as a district office.

Life The son of Thomas Langton, a merchant at Riga and Liverpool who died in 1838 in Canada West, he was born at Farfield, near Addingham in the West Riding of Yorkshire, on 17 April 1803; his mother was Ellen, daughter of the Rev. William Currer, vicar of Clapham, and the artist and author Anne Langton was his sister. He was educated mainly abroad, where he acquired familiarity with foreign languages. From 1821 to 1829 Langton was in business in Liverpool, becoming an agent for some mercantile firms in Russia. Moving to Manchester in August 1829, he accepted a responsible position in Heywood's Bank, where he had a post until 1854. In that year he became managing director of the Manchester & Salford Bank, which then prospered for the next 22 years. He resigned in October 1876 when his sight failed. Langton was associated with the establishment of some prominent Manchester institutions. He took part in the planning of the Manchester Athenæum in 1836, with Richard Cobden and James Heywood. When the Chetham Society was founded in 1843 he became one of its earliest members; elected its treasurer, he subsequently became secretary. About 1846 he acted as secretary to a committee that was formed to obtain a university for Manchester, an unsuccessful scheme. With James Kay he promoted the Manchester and Salford District Provident Society, set up in 1833, and the Manchester Statistical Society of the same year. The aims of the Manchester and Salford District Provident Society were \\"for the encouragement of frugality and forethought ...and the occasional relief of sickness and unavoidable misfortune amongst the poor\\". When Langton retired, £5,000 was raised in his honour, and a Langton fellowship was founded at Owens College. He spent his retirement at Ingatestone, Essex, where he died on 29 September 1881. He was buried in Fryerning churchyard, Essex. Works Langton edited for the Chetham Society three volumes of Chetham Miscellanies 1851, 1856, 1862; Lancashire Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1875; and Thomas Benolt's The Visitation of Lancashire and a Part of Cheshire of 1533, 2 vols. 1876–82. To the Manchester Statistical Society Langton contributed in 1857 a paper on the Balance of Account between the Mercantile Public and the Bank of England, and in 1867 a presidential address. Among financial papers he wrote On Banks and Bank Shareholders, 1879, and a letter on savings banks, 1880, addressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Family Langton married at Kirkham, Lancashire, on 15 November 1831, Margaret, daughter of Joseph Hornby of Ribby Hall, Lancashire. They had three sons and six daughters. Two of the daughters married sons of Benjamin Heywood; another, Katharine Elizabeth, was the second wife of Joseph Gouge Greenwood.

The election was held on 27 November 1950, and four members were elected to the First Legislative Council. At the time of the election the British Virgin Islands was governed as part of the Leeward Islands and the Legislative Council was constituted under Leeward Islands Act, 1950. After the election a new Constitution of the British Virgin Islands came into effect (the Constitution (Virgin Islands) Act, 1950). The 1950 Constitution was intended to be an interim measure, but several elections were later conducted under it until the 1967 Constitution was promulgated. Background The British Virgin Islands had formerly had a Legislative Council, but it had been dissolved in 1901 largely due to lack of interest, and the Territory had been governed directly as part of the Leeward Islands. But in 1947 a fisherman from Anegada named Theodolph H Faulkner came to Tortola with his pregnant wife. He had a disagreement with the medical officer, and he went straight to the marketplace and for several nights criticised the government with mounting passion. His oratory struck a chord, a march of over 1,500 British Virgin Islanders led by community leaders presented their grievances at the Commissioner's office. Following on from the march of 1947 the British undertook to organise elections and work towards the restoration of direct rule. In the end it took over three years for elections to occur. At the time of election, the British Virgin Islands was a heavily underdeveloped country: The electoral framework under which the election was conducted was archaic. Voters were required to pass a literacy test, effectively disenfranchising much of the population. Electoral candidates were required, amongst other things, to be landowners in order to stand for election.This may have been the reason that Theodolph H Faulkner was not elected and/or did not stand, despite being a popular political figure of the time. Results The busts of Isaac Fonseca and Carlton de Castro outside of the Legislative Council building. The four persons elected to the inaugural Legislative Council were: # Isaac Glanville Fonseca # H.R. Penn, MBE # Carlton L.E. de Castro # John Charles Brudenell-Bruce, MBE There were no political parties in the Territory at the time, nor any system of Ministerial government. Accordingly, whilst the Council had legislative powers they did not have any executive authority, which continued to be administered through the British-appointed Administrator of the British Virgin Islands. There appears to be no reliable historical record of any other candidates who stood, or the vote tallies in relation to the election. It has been noted that the person whose actions ultimately led to the election, Theodolph Faulkner, was not in fact elected. As noted above, it may be that he failed the requirement of being a property owner (which would be abolished by the next election, when he would stand successfully). It is unclear if this is because he did not stand, or was not elected. However, Faulkner would later be elected to the Legislature in the 1954 election and then again in the 1960 election. Although he would run for election again in the future, Captain Carlton de Castro would only ever serve that one term in the legislature. Mr Brudenell-Bruce never ran for election again, but he served again in the 2nd District when Edwin Leonard stepped down in August 1954 and he was appointed to take the vacant seat. H.R. Penn continued to serve in the legislature until he was beaten decisively in the 1963 general election and declined to run again. He then later served as Speaker of the Legislative Council between 1971 and 1975. Mr Fonseca had the longest political career, and would serve continuously in the legislature until his defeat in the 1971 general election. First Legislative Council Curiously, the four elected members made up a minority of the Legislative Council. The other five members were: * John Augustus Cockburn Cruikshank, the Administrator of the British Virgin Islands (who was President and Chair) * Two financial officials (nominated unofficial members): ** Olva Georges ** Benjamin Romney * Two nominated official members: ** Dr W.T. Joseph ** A.T. FranklinA.T. Franklin was replaced by Norwell Harrigan in the same year. Norwell Harrigan was replaced by Arthur Caines in 1951.

Many bishops, priests, and monks have strongly condemned theatrical amusements, and they even declared the actors to be 'instruments of Satan', 'a curse to the Church', and 'beguiling unstable souls'. The Roman Catholic Church believed theatre caused people to “indulge themselves in amusements which its fascinations interfere with the prosecution of the serious work of daily life. Anything pleasing or appealing to the lower nature, the ‘sensual appetites,’ were considered as temptations as dictated in the Lord’s Prayer: ‘Lead us not into temptation,’” which one must avoid in order to lead an ideal Christian life. One must eat and drink for strength and not for gluttony and drunkenness, rest and sleep to the glory of God and not to sink into indolence and sloth nor to become the masters instead of the servants of the body, and amusements are the most dangerous temptations and the worst impulses from otherwise, \\"many Christians will relax their ordinary strictness “for the sake of the cause,” and that having once obtained a “taste of the nectar, they will continue to drink it” The Church instead encouraged Christians to strive to please their neighbours for good edification rather than pleasing oneself.  Clerical attacks on the actors  Adrienne Lecouvreur's portrait painted ca. 1725; She died as an actress who was excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church Actors endured the Church’s antitheatrical attacks, which included \\"social humiliations, aggressive animosity toward their profession and their lowly reputation. Religious attitude toward theatre not only hampered the profession as a whole but also humiliated them as individuals which also affected their family members\\". In the 1860s, James H. McVicker a theatre professional in Chicago had seen “a child refused admittance to a school, for a reason that the parents were connected with a theatre.\\" In the same decade, the actress Anna Cora Mowatt stated that “being an actress, people considered her and all the actresses as immoral, flighty, silly buffoons who are not to be taken seriously for a moment.” This was due to the low reputation the Roman Catholic Church had given to the theatre. The theatre was affected financially as well because in “many areas, townspeople were scared away from viewing the performances under the Church’s influence, and the difficulty in attracting audiences resulted in inability to pay actors living wages and forced some to abandon their professions.” Travelling troupes, who perform in different cities had experienced difficulties getting help from the locals with the tasks of “finding a place to sleep, suitable place to perform, finding carpenters to build basic set ups, and finding musicians, etc., and the lack of local help was due to religious objection.” The Church also influenced greatly in producing new actors as many parents, worried about the low reputation of the profession, discouraged their children from pursuing the career as an actor. “Noah Ludlow had to flee home to pursue his dream in theatre which his parents disapproved of, and even much later when he got married, his wife’s family pressured him to abandon his career on stage.”  Church’s treatment towards women in theatre  In 1860, John Angell James in Female Piety or A Young Woman’s Friend and Guide expresses that “the nature of the women derive from Eve, who was the cause of the sin and death in our world as well as the reason why mankind was driven out of the Garden of Eden. She is a temptress who caused the fall of the man by tempting him into doing evil.” James then adds: “She could never attain to dignity, and even with all her brightest charms, could rarely appear but with the beauty of a doll” The actresses “frequently changed costumes in the same general backstage with men, and they gave lascivious smiles, kissed and played love scene with men on the stage.\\" The Church considered these acts as acts of tempting men, and therefore, actresses’ appearances on the stage was viewed with “impurity” or “immorality” because of her profession. Such religious prejudice led the divorce rate of actress to be higher than other women of different professions. In John Harold Wilson’s All the King’s Ladies from 1958, Wilson presents synonym of “actress” as “prostitute” because financially depraved actresses difficulty in attracting audiences were expected to be available offstage to wealthy men, and out of eighty women who were known to have been actresses in London from 1660 to 1689, at least twelve according to Wilson’s research, left the stage to become mistresses or prostitutes.  Limitations on French theatre imposed by Church  A priest giving the last rites to a sick person in deathbed. Even exclusively Catholic countries were “tolerant of the church-goers’ ordinary theatrical amusements and allowed the general population to patronize the theatre. In most of the countries, theatres were even allowed to be opened on Sunday evenings when the popular plays are put on the boards. In Lent, the Catholic Church would dissuade or even prohibit the people from going to the theatre, and in some countries, where the civil law is controlled by the Church of Rome, the theaters were closed in Lent.” The theatres in France had even more restrictions and limitations as the actors turned to the royal patronage for financial aid by joining the state theatre, Comédie-Française. “The actors of this state theatre were considered as servants of the king and were expected to entertain at the court under the rules and regulations of the royal authority. Anything from assigning roles to the actors and demanding actors to be punctual on the rehearsals were strictly controlled by the royal authority. Playwrights were personally obligated to obtain official approvals from the Lieutenant-General of Police who read the manuscripts and gave approvals based on the rules revolved around the King as well as the Church and the political notables. Plays could not mock or violate Roman Catholic beliefs and ceremonies, nor it can satirize living public figures (including the monarch)” “The Church in France also condemned the theatre as a school for scandal, held all actors to be ipso facto excommunicated, and forbade their burial in consecrated ground - which included every cemetery in Paris: :“Actors are paid wages by the King, and excommunicated by the Church; they are ordered by the King to play every evening, and forbidden to play at all by the ritual. If they do not play they are put in to prison [as happened when His Majesty's Players went on strike]; if they play they are [at death] cast into the sewers” In fact, in 1730, Adrienne Lecouvreur died at the age of 38, but she was denied Christian burial and was hastily buried in the dead of night in an unmarked grave. This was because the Church in France still banned the actors from receiving any sacraments which included marriage, baptism, or final rites, and only by renouncing their professions first, they were able to receive the sacraments from the Church. Also, the Church refused Molière’s burial in the sanctified burial because he had not received the last rites with the priest present and that he did not renounce his profession as an actor before his death. When King Louis XIV directly intervened, the Archbishop of Paris allowed Molière to be buried only after sunset among the suicides’ and paupers’ graves with no requiem masses permitted in the Church.  Patristic views on theatre  St. Augustine's Confessions * Clement of Alexandria (150-215 A.D.): dramatic compositions are nonsense and empty and would only lead to human misery. Christ is the real, eternal truth in the theatre of the universe. Christians don't serve two masters so they must maintain distant from theatre which doesn't serve Christ. * Tertullian (160-230 A.D.): First Latin Church Father was against the existence of permanent theatre. Tertullian interpreted the theatre of Pompeius as the theatre as a whole, as a dwelling place of the gods Venus and Liber, and a place where idololatria (capital crime of mankind including adultery, fraud, drunkenness, fornication; accumulation of deadly sins) committed. He thought theatre belonged to the pomp of the devil, and whoever went to theatre could not be an official. * Arnobius (300 A.D.) and Lactantius (260-340 A.D.): Arnobius considered theatre to the special and favourable ground for the activity of the daemons to exercise their influence on humans. Lactantius says that with the conversion of Constantine in the fifth century, a Christian culture slowly began to emerge which was manifested in art, literature and Christian architecture which is committing idoloatria (capital crime; an accumulation of several deadly sins). * Augustine (354-430 A.D.): the origin of the gods and the theatre are “deadly poison” and “crazy institution” rooted in demoralization and licentiousness and thus a dangerous influence on Roman youth. “The statues, effigies and altars of Roman theatres marked their theatres as the domain of the pagan gods, and theatre, with the rest of the pagan culture, substitutes the spiritual joy of knowing God through scripture with earthly obsessions.” :* Discusses about the theatre in his texts: Confessions, The City of God, Concerning the Teacher, and On Christian Doctrine. :* Confessions: Augustine was attracted to theatre (the tragedies) and enjoyed the actor's performances which gave him things to grieve and pity from which he gained \\"harmful pleasure.” Theatrical performances only affected the surface of his emotion, and as if he had been scratched with the poisoned fingernails, his life was filled with inflammation, swelling, putrefaction and corruption. * Isidore of Seville (ca. 560-633 A.D.): emphasized the wickedness of the stage should not be blamed on men but on the daemons because they had initiated the theatre.  Defending theatre  J. M. Beckley argues that “amusement is necessary” in order to relieve frustrations from everyday life and to “let off steam.” The body and mind will alike to rebel if they are constantly being under the surveillance of the Church. Theatre gratifies some of the desires of men, pleases their tastes.

A second machine was built in 1929 by the Klemm Leichtflugzeugbau GmbH (\\"Klemm Light Aircraft Company\\"). Design and development The Akademische Fliegeruppe Darmstadt, founded in 1921, was the first of several Akafliegs associated with German universities intended to give annually changing student teams experience of aircraft design. They rapidly acquired a good reputation for inventive glider design. Though most of their aircraft were intended for their own use and investigation and were given Darmstadt D- numbers such as the D-6 Geheimrat, they also received some orders from individuals or club and these, built in ones or twos, were client named, received no D- number and brought welcome funds to the group. These, too, were sometimes also designed by student teams and often built by them. The Württemberg was made for Wolf Hirth, who named it after his home state. The Württemberg was a high, cantilever wing aircraft. Its wing, like the rest of the aircraft was wooden and covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. It was built around a single spar. with ply covering from it around the leading edge forming a torsion- resistant D-box. Behind the spar the wing was mostly fabric covered. In plan there was a rectangular centre section that filled about 40% of the span and tapered outer panels tapering to elliptical tips. The ailerons filled about 40% of the span from the tips. The Württemberg's wing was mounted over the fuselage on a low, ply covered pylon which sat on top of the fuselage and extended well behind the wing trailing edge, gradually decreasing in height. Its open, unscreened cockpit was partly under the leading edge. The fuselage was ovoid in cross section, tapering and becoming more pointed on its underside aft. It was entirely ply covered. All tail surfaces were built in a similar way to the wing. Both rudder and elevators were all-moving and balanced, with straight edges, rounded tips and with their short mountings faired into the fuselage. The rudder extended down to the keel, so a generous cut-out in the elevators was provided for its movement. The Württemberg had a short landing skid under the forward fuselage and a spring type tailskid. A second Württemberg was completed in 1929 at the Klemm Leichtflugzeugbau GmbH (\\"Klemm Light Aircraft Company\\") for the Württembergischer Luftfahrt-Verband (Aeronautical Association Württemberg) at Stuttgart, with slightly greater wing area and a shorter fuselage. Operational history In 1928 Hirth flew the Württemberg in France at the International contest at Vauville, on the Channel coast near Cherbourg, with great success. Glider flight here followed the coast over sandhills and relied on slope lift from a West wind; the Württemberg was suited to the weak wind that blew during the competition. He won prizes for the greatest height gain (), straight-line distance (), height () and for the number of flights lasting more than 30 minutes (10).

The area of Mong Kok is especially known for its plethora of stores and vendors who sell assorted knickknacks, playthings, clothing, tools, electronics, and food, along with all other sorts of novelties. Mong Kok also provides a variety of entertainment, among which includes the cinema, for young adults and teenagers. The multipurpose nature of the area thus draws in teenagers and young adults who avidly pursue the latest popular trends. The area is also a popular meet-up and dating location amongst local youth. Teenagers who have a high affinity for the Mong Kok culture and hang around the area but do not necessarily live there are known as MK people (MK guys or MK girls depending on their gender) or a MK person. Their age typically ranges between 14-25 and often dress in particular styles of clothing, including Hip Hop or punk, without fully acknowledging the implications of what they wear. Essentially, the term MK person, which carries a rather negative undertone, is often used to describe a person who blindly follows trends without thought with the implication that they have a poor taste or behaves in a bad way. It could also mean that he or she has nothing productive to do so as to idly squander their time wandering around the streets of Mong Kok. Image of the MK (Mong Kok) people = Appearance = The origin of their dressing style is believed to be the movie series Young and Dangerous produced in the 1990s, which describes the lives of Hong Kong gangsters and their triad activities. However, some other people believe that it is because this group of people purchase their Hip Hop clothing in Mong Kok only. The characteristics include their hairstyles, which are preferably dyed into brighter colors such as gold and silver. Another tendency is to have longer bangs that cover their foreheads or even their eyes. Typical Mong Kok culture attire includes: sleeveless shirts, black garments, bell-bottom trousers, and a number of accessories such as chains around trousers, earrings, and necklaces. Advocates and followers of this particular culture also tend to sport tattoos. These tattoos are often situated on their upper arms, which remain visible to those around them because of the prevalence of sleeveless shirts amongst the culture. = Behavior = Those who participle in MK culture are considered to be active on the social-networking sites and online forums, where they can actively share their own lives. This gives them a sense of community for their shared values, and has given a rise to terminology and abbreviations unique to the culture's community. = Features of their spoken language and written language = People who are perceived as a representative of Mong Kok culture always have similar characteristics on their verbal expression and written language. There are several types of features on their use of language, especially the choice of words: Unique Terms Mong Kok Culture has a select, unique vocabulary of words that those foreign to the culture may not necessarily understand. Example: the labeling of men who always ingratiate women as “gourmet”. Usage of abbreviations Notable examples of abbreviations common in their 'language' include calling “Fa Yuen Street” as “Fa Street”, and “Argyle Centre” as “M Centre”. Interweaving of Profanity in everyday speech It is quite common for advocates of Mong Kok culture to extensively weave in profanities in everyday interactions. The aforementioned idiosyncrasy also appears in their written language. In addition to profanities, they also like to use Martian language, which is formed by using words that have similar or exact pronunciation in Cantonese to replace the original words, or the extensive use of symbols to illustrate their facial expressions when they chat online. Thus, it is often difficult for those foreign to the culture to correctly understand and interpret phrases that are common amongst the users. Media portrayal Being a prominent underground subculture in Hong Kong, Mong Kok Culture is often discussed in many forms of media. However, whether it be exaggerated comedy or serious discussion, most media coverage regarding the subculture is held with negative undertones. = Films = Young and Dangerous This famous Hong Kong movie series is about a gangster Chan Ho-nam. His clothing, behaviours, and hairstyle in the films became a trend that teenagers in 1996-1997 liked to imitate. The looks of those characters in the films was the beginning of the MK style. Lan Kwai Fong (film) Lan Kwai Fong is a movie series that talks about the lives of people who go to Lan Kwai Fong at night frequently. Although the films are more about going to bars and having sex, the lifestyles of characters are also regarded as MK style nowadays. The series fully shows what MK culture is. = Stars = MK-pop In 2014, a multitude of singers and pop groups emerged (e.g. FAITH) that tried to replicate the style of K-pop. Their imitations of the style was received negatively by netizens online. Criticisms from netizens often consist of labeling the music as \\"MK-pop\\". This label comes from the Mong Kok Culture being stereotyped as a culture that blindly follows trends in conjunction to groups like FAITH drawing heavy inspiration from K-pop. = News = Mong Kok Culture frequently appears as a topic in the Apple Daily tabloid. Articles regarding the culture are often blatantly mocking towards the culture.

Through many initiatives, which includes the Diversity League Table consultation, Nwokolo has led BSN to work consistently in the direction of widening meaningful participation and access to legal services in the United Kingdom. She is noted for progressive vision in the following words: “Working with our partners we’re trying to move things forward in terms of creating a legal workforce drawn from the most meritorious. The inclusion of questions about the social background of lawyers, and lawyers to be, represents an important new phase of the consultation.” This crucial Diversity League Table reporting has four main diversity areas; namely: gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disabilities. Focusing on the demographic composition of law firms and chambers, results are shown as a sequence of organisation profiles and successive leagues tables; ranking participants in major areas, and also showing an overall ranking on the complete Diversity League Table. All her professional life, Nwokolo has advocated and campaigned for the elimination of any form of discrimination and unfair treatment of people in the United Kingdom, Nigeria and across countries of the world; and she affirms that \\"there is much work to be done\\" by all humankind in the years ahead. Nwokolo said: \\"We must lead the charge, and not follow in the wake of others who are not as well equipped as solicitors to provide and deliver legal services\\" for improved human rights, political freedom and survival of black and minority ethnic (BME) practices in the United Kingdom and globally. In support of Nigerian lawyers, Nwokolo has been a strong advocate for better practices in the African country; and, also, for Nigerian-born lawyers in the United Kingdom, urging the SRA: Solicitors Regulation Authority to be humanely constructive and unbiased in terms of engaging BMES: Black and Minority Ethnic Solicitors in progressive programmes and activities. Also, over the years, Nwokolo has been a willing supporter of SRA through her service of helping specialist groups understand complexities and issues facing them on equality and diversity matters. =House of Lords= Representing women, disadvantaged people and ethnic minorities, in November 2011, at the House of Lords Constitution Committee, in her service as Black Solicitors Network Chair, Nwokolo favoured the renowned \\"plateau of merit\\" reality, concerning the process of appointing Judges in the United Kingdom. She affirmed: \\"“We don’t want a judiciary that is not meritorious … [but] you may be leaving out a lot of people who would benefit society as a whole.\\" With the plateau of merit \\"you look at society as a whole and accept merit exists in many different places and identify merit where you wouldn't normally look.\\" At the House of Lords, Nwokolo is an acclaimed champion of: human welfare, valuable servant leadership vision, enduring tolerance, Intercultural communication, learning to live together , empathic knowledge transfer and making sure that appropriate training is given to those involved in the judicial appointments procedure. She is known to have stated that: \\"There is a need to expand the thinking around judicial appointments, including giving equality and diversity training to the people who make recommendations for appointments.\\" =Law Society Council= In 2009, Nwokolo began her second term on the Council of the Law Society of England and Wales, and chaired the Law Society Group Equality and Diversity Committee for three years.

She is a clear voice on the need for mentorship programmes and strategies of encouragement for young people interested in studying law. Affirmatively advocating for an excellent, innovative and exemplary legal education system in the United Kingdom as Law Society Council Member for Minority Ethnic Concerns and Chair of the Law Society Group Equality and Diversity Committee, Nwokolo, said in 2009: \\"The solicitors' profession continues to attract BME student lawyers despite the high cost of the academic, conversion and practice aspects of training to be a solicitor. It was easier in the past when grants were available from one's local authority even for the post university stage. The law is an extremely competitive profession as was emphasised by all our panellists. To succeed, you do not necessarily need a first from Oxbridge. What is required is a belief in yourself, passion, integrity, honesty, persistence and a capacity for hard work. You do need as many mentors as you can muster and all our panellists made themselves available to aspiring lawyers in need of help in this regard. A degree in law continues to be highly sought after and valued by employers. Young lawyers should therefore be ready to be innovative and creative in the use of their valuable training as legal professionals.\\" Personal life Married to Chuka Nwokolo, a medical doctor and professor of gastroenterology and nutrition at University of Warwick, they have two daughters: Munachiso and Idu.

It is located on the island of the island of Ukujima (33.27011°N 129.11171°), administratively to Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture. The project has been originated and developed by Photovolt Development Partners GmbH (PVDP) starting in 2012. In December 2018 a consortium of local companies formed by Kyudenko Corporation acquired the project.  History  The project started in 2012 with the aim of helping to contribute to environmental protection and economic revitalization on the island. The land area for the project covers more than 800 hectares of largely unused land. To facilitate the project a special purpose company TeraSol G.K. was established, which signed more than 11,000 individual lease agreements with around 1250 landowners. The land registry had to be updated in many cases and owners to be located throughout Japan. In March 2013, the project obtained the METI approval, qualifying for participation under the Japanese Act on Special Measures concerning the Procurement of Renewable Electric Energy by Operators of Electric Utilities (the \\"RENA\\") with a feed-in tariff as FY 2012 project. The first application for Grid Connection was filed with Kyushu Electric Power in March 2013. In July 2016 the project finally obtained Grid Connection Application approval from Kyushu Electric Power for a direct current, high voltage submarine transmission system based on VSC technology from Siemens. Subsequent permits and authorization were obtained and construction start is scheduled for Q1/ 2020. The project was successfully developed by PVDP and subsequently Kyudenko Corporation because of, among other factors the strong support from local communities, most notably local residents and the City of Sasebo. After acquired the majority interest in the project the consortium formed by Kyudenko Corporation established a new special purpose company, Ukujima Future Energy Holdings G.K., which assumed all rights and obligations related to the project from TeraSol G.K. and is becoming the legal owner and operator of the solar park. On 28 April 2020, Kyocera Corporation issued a press release confirming investment of JPY 50 billion (approx. USD 466 million) by the consortium to finance the construction of the project.https://www.kyocera.co.jp/news/2020/0404_kfje.html  Power generation  The project is designed around a 33 kV circular network connecting different construction sites on the island and feeding electricity into high voltage transformer for step up to 220 kV. The connection to the grid network of Kyushu Electric Power is at Ainoura substation located in Sasebo-city, Nagasaki Prefecture through the 64 km HVDC submarine cable. The original design provided by Siemens was subsequently changed by the consortium to another manufacturer. Extensive studies have been undertaken by Toshiba to study the effects on the grid using both, VSC and conventional, alternating current connections. The results indicated that both connection methods would be feasible. However, due to the application status and ongoing grid connection study by Kyushu Electric it was decided to continue with VSC technology, despite higher construction cost. A number of seabed investigations had to be undertaken and consent from local fisherman to be obtained. As parts of the construction sites are located on agricultural land, PVDP has asked a Fraunhofer Institute to simulate the effects of shadowing on growth of biomass and to design an Agri-Solar system that would both satisfy the requirements of METI for the use of such land and local farmers’ needs. To cope with challenging topography, proximity to sea and high wind speeds PVDP undertook various simulations to propose a workable design for the solar installations and adjacent high voltage equipment, that were forming the basis for approvals obtained by Kyudenko as designated engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) company for the construction of the project. The project shows the flexibility of photovoltaic installations to adapt to challenging conditions and is an convincing example of the ability to overcome any obstacles if in the interest of all stakeholders.

Since World War II, the Islands came under United Nation’s (UN) trusteeship and were administered by the United States. After becoming a sovereign state in 1994, Palau joined the UN and ratified the Convention on the Rights of a Child (CRC) in 1995, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the Optional Protocol to the CRPD in 2013. In 2011, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in 2011 and other core human rights treaties were signed. These treaties are yet to be ratified.Human Right's Library Palau's constitution and laws confer most human rights to its citizens, and with the UN and the United States continuing to have a strong influence over the island nation, Palau is continuing to work towards complying with human rights standards expounded by the UN. International treaties In September 2011, Palau signed seven core human rights treaties. The Pacific Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights congratulated Palau on these signatures, noting that “the commitment shown by these signatures is remarkable and gives a clear message that Palau has now started a journey to provide people in the country with a stronger foundation to enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms.”, OHCHR Press Release 23 September 2011. Convention on the Rights of the Child Traditional Palauan culture and current constitutional protection afford a high degree of care to Palauan children. It is noted that the situation for children is generally good and that in some instances there is a higher degree of protection than is mandated for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.Nation’s Rights of the Child There is a strong family dynamic, which includes extended family all taking part in “the child’s evolving capacity” and “best interests”.Pacific Regional MDG’s Tracking Report However, Palau is experiencing extreme change to their economic, cultural and societal nature, due globalisation and climate change.Climate Change in the Pacific =Child abuse= It must be noted, that along with strong care of the child, most adults in Palau are comfortable with physical discipline, this is because in both civil society and law, discipline and control of children are seen as a right and responsibility of the parents.Nation’s Rights of the Child In 2001, seven years after the signing of the CRC, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child were concerned about the increasing trend of abuse, including sexual, domestic violence, ill-treatment and neglect to the children of Palau. There was also concern about the lack of legal provisions that enabled the Government to step in and remove a child from the situation.RefWorld 2009 It was argued that this increase in abuse was due to changing family structure and increasing alcohol and drug intake. Victims of Crime Assistance (VOCA), which handles abuse cases, have found that 80% of the cases are associated with alcohol abuse. In 2009 according to RefWorld, there were 25 reported cases of child abuse. These varied between physical abuse (Eight), neglect (Six) but the most serious was that of sexual abuse (Eleven).RefWorld 2009 Seven of these cases arrived at court and only three resulted in convictions. Education has been a main proponent of decreasing physical abuse along with stronger laws, which both seem to have had an impact. It was found by RefWorld in 2013RefWorld 2013 that although there are still some isolated reports of child neglect, law enforcement officers are treating the issue more seriously and any complaints made are aggressively investigated and prosecuted. Also the Office of Victims of Crimes, work with children who have suffered abuse and the families involved. It appears that Children’s rights are generally respected in this regard traditionally and that the State is working on educating parents on the dangers of physical and emotional abuse and that if there are problems of abuse, that the child is properly cared for. =Education and Health= Education in Palau has always been considered to be incredibly important. In the 1920s almost 90%Pacific Regional MDG’s Tracking Report of Palaunan children were enrolled at school. Education is free and universal provided by the Government of Palau. In 2007 around 11% of GDP was allocated in expenditure to the education sector.Pacific Regional MDG’s Tracking Report Legislation mandates school attendance from the age of 6 until 17 years of age, which contributes to high literacy rates.Pacific Regional MDG’s Tracking Report There have been concerns that the curriculum is out of date. The Government has responded to criticisms and prepared a series of 10 year master plans that work toward increasing the quality of education. The most recent plan spanning from 2006 to 2016.Pacific Regional MDG’s Tracking Report The plans focus on student achievement and quality of instruction by improving teacher training and certification, upgrading school facilities, improving school governance, strengthening student support services, and making the curriculum more relevant. In addition to this, children have a wide range of opportunities offered to them outside of a formal education, which include cultural expression and recreational activities. Generally the children are quite healthy, the Palauan children have a low prevalence of children who are unweight and there is no evidence to suggest that there is any food poverty.Pacific Regional MDG’s Tracking Report However, the diet of the Palauan people is poor and contributes to malnutrition and a high incidence of children being overweight.Pacific Regional MDG’s Tracking Report Despite this there is a well-funded system of medical care for children, with no discrimination based on gender. There is discrimination when it comes to children who are not born in Palau. Admittedly there is only a small number of these children but they are not eligible for Palauan citizenship, which can cause problems as under law only those of Palauan’ descent are entitled to free education and health. The Committee of the Rights of the Child and the United States has noted this as a concern, as this type of discrimination is aimed at young vulnerable children. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Palau was the sixth Pacific Island Forum nation to sign the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.Pacific Island Forum Secretariat The rights of the disabled are applicable to all disabled, young or elderlyRights Education Associates and are generally respected, with the Government enforcing these rights through legal means. Art. 4.5 of the ConstitutionPalau Constitution designate the disabled to be a vulnerable group entitled to special consideration by the government and acts include Disabled Persons Anti-discrimination Act and a Handicapped Children Act.United States Report These laws require access to government buildings, which is usually enforced and public schools have established special programs in order to cater to the needs of disabled children. The Government also provides those with disabilities a monthly amount of $50,United States Report along with all measures designed to assist them so that they can be as self-reliant as possible. Disabled are also treated as close as possible as to those who are the same age, therefore they are entitled to the same living conditions, protected from exploitation and abuse and they have organisations that liaise with the Government and look after the rights of the disabledRights Education Associates Palau is continuing to work towards strengthening the rights of the disabled. In October 2013,Pacific Island Forum Secretariat Palau held a three- day workshop to discuss ways to “strengthen support and ensure a better quality of life for person’s living under disabilities”.Pacific Island Forum Secretariat Together with Omekesang Disabled Persons Organisation, The Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) and the Pacific Disability Forum (PDF), discussion centred around the continued effective implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, where the Minister of Health Gregorio Ngirmang promised that “The Ministry of Health will continue to provide full support to activities related to persons with disabilities; in particular, providing better health related services”.Pacific Island Forum Secretariat The point was made that it was not just a matter of advocating and promoting rights but also working towards more support so that the aims of the Convention can be fully realised. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) =Religious Freedom= In 2011, one of the treaties signed was the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.Island Forum Secretariat Part II, Art II provided that “Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognised in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as…… religion…..birth or other status”. This can be found in accordance with Art. 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion… and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.United Nations In accordance with this human right the Constitution of Palau states that in respect of religious freedom; “The Govt shall take no action to deny or impair the freedom of conscience or of philosophical or religious belief of any person nor take any action to compel, prohibit or hinder the exercise of religion. The Government shall not recognised or establish a national religion, but may provide assistance to private or parochial schools on a fair and equitable basis for non-religious purposes” (Article IV, Section I of the Constitution).Palau Constitution It further states that; “The Government shall take no action to discriminate against any person on the basis of sex, race, place of origin, language, religion or belief, social status or clan affiliation except for the preferential treatment of citizens, for protection of minors, elderly, indigent, physically or mentally handicapped, and other similar groups, and in matters concerning intr[a]state succession and domestic relations” (Art IV).Palau Constitution Palau generally respects a person’s religious freedom with not only the Constitution in place to protect individual’s rights, but other laws and policies.States Report While religious organisations have to apply to register with the Government, they are never deniedFreedom House Further there are no reports of Religious discrimination based on belief or practice from any individual from the state and as mentioned above, while the government does not sponsor nor promote religious groups and activities (including public schools), representatives of any religious group may request financial support for religious schools. The Government also observes Christmas as a national holiday, due to the vast majority of the population being Christian. It is estimated that the population of Palau is around 21,000 with the largest domination being Roman Catholic making up 65% of the population. Other religions include Evangelical Church with around 2000 followers, Seventh-day Adventists around 1000, Modekengei (unique to the country) 1800, Latter Day Saints are around 300, and the smallest group is Jehovah’s Witnesses who are around 90.States Report The Government continues to ban work permits for citizens of Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. The Bangladesh ban was imposed in 1998 while the India and Sri Lanka ban occurred in 2001.States Report These bans were largely motivated due to employers complaints that non-Christian religious practices were interfering in living arrangements of employee families and activities in the work place. Workers from these countries who were already in Palau were not deported and the small Islamic Community of 400 from Bangladesh continues to be allowed to conduct prayers at work during the day and in their own homes.States Report There does not seem to be impediments to their practice of religion or to their continued employment.

It was the first electric locomotive used in Poland. First two engines were bought in the United Kingdom in 1933, additional four were license-built in First Locomotives Factory in Chrzanów, with the electrical machinery imported from England and mechanical part produced locally. The six locomotives, named EL.101 through EL.106, entered service on 15 December 1936. In early 1939 parts for additional four locomotives were ordered in the United Kingdom. Assembled for delivery in August 1939, they were captured in Gdynia by German forces during the Invasion of Poland and never completed.

With population estimates between 300,000 and half a million, Southern California boasts the largest concentration of Iranians in the world, outside of Iran. The Iranian diaspora in Los Angeles includes those who fled the 1979 Islamic revolution, the increased immigration after the 2009 Green Movement and those were born in the U.S. Southern California is also distinct from Northern California with its larger presence of Armenian Iranians and Iranian Jews. History Iranian immigrants began arriving in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. As the 1979 Iranian Revolution unfolded, large numbers of Iranians fled Iran. Many of them settled in Los Angeles.Daragahi, Borzou. \\"Exiles keep Iran in touch.\\" Los Angeles Times. December 10, 2009. p. 1. Retrieved on April 2, 2014. Many Iranian immigrants, including Muslims, Christians, and Jews, originated from the upper classes. Los Angeles was ideal for Iranians because it reminded them of home. The \\"landscape, the car culture, [and] the mountains\\" was similar to what was found in 1970s Iran, says Dr. Reza Aslan. Over the years, the Iranian community expanded across Southern California, with large numbers settling in Beverly Hills, the San Fernando Valley, Irvine and greater Orange County, as well as the Inland Empire. Regarding Iranian-Americans of Armenian origin, the 1980 US Census put the number of Armenians living in Los Angeles at 52,400, of which 71.9% were foreign born: 14.7% in Iran, 14.3% in the USSR, 11.5% in Lebanon, 9.7% in Turkey, 11.7% in other Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, etc.), and the rest in other parts of the world.

As of 1980 about 70% of ethnic Armenian immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Iran, and Lebanon had arrived between 1975 and 1980.Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr, \\"Subethnicity: Armenians in Los Angeles,\\" p. 250. =Iranian Armenians= The 15-year-long Lebanese Civil War that started in 1975 and the Iranian revolution of 1979 greatly contributed to the influx of Middle Eastern Armenians to the US. The Armenian communities in these Middle Eastern countries were well established and integrated, but not assimilated, into local populations. Armenians in Lebanon and Iran are represented in the parliaments as ethnic minorities. Many lived in luxury in their former countries, and more easily handled multilingualism, while retaining aspects of traditional Armenian culture. Regarding Iranian-Americans of Armenian origin, the 1980 US Census put the number of Armenians living in Los Angeles at 52,400, of which 71.9% were foreign born: 14.7% in Iran, 14.3% in the USSR, 11.5% in Lebanon, 9.7% in Turkey, 11.7% in other Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Iraq, Israel, etc.), and the rest in other parts of the world. In 1988 up to 3,000 Iranian Armenians were scheduled to arrive in the Los Angeles area.

Most customers and employees of Iranian Armenians who had self-employment were not Armenian and not Iranian, while most business partners of self-employed Iranian Armenians were fellow Iranian Armenians.

As of 1980, 80% of Iranian Armenians have fellow Armenian Iranians at their social gatherings and as spouses and close friends. Iranian Armenian parents have proportionately higher numbers of Armenian friends compared to their children. =Iranian Jews= As of 2008 the Los Angeles area had the largest Persian Jewish population in the U.S., at 50,000.

In the 1970s members of the Mahboubi family settled in Beverly Hills and began buying real estate on Rodeo Drive. The Beverly Hills Unified School District, the established Jewish community, security, and the reputation for wealth attracted Iranian Jews to Beverly Hills, and a commercial area of the city became known as \\"Tehrangeles\\" due to Iranian ownership of businesses in the Golden Triangle.West, Kevin. \\"The Persian Conquest.\\" W Magazine. July 2009. Retrieved on March 11, 2015. After the 1979 Iranian Revolution about 30,000 Iranian Jews settled in Beverly Hills and the surrounding area. Iranian Jews who lost funds in Iran were able to quickly adapt due to their high level of education, overseas funds, and experience in the business sector. In 1988 1,300 Iranian Jews settled in Los Angeles. In 1990 John L. Mitchell of the Los Angeles Times wrote that these Iranian Jews \\"function as part of a larger Iranian community\\" but that they also \\"in many respects[...]form a community of their own\\" as they \\"still manage to live their lives nearly surrounded by the culture of their homeland--going to Iranian nightclubs, worshiping at Iranian synagogues, shopping for clothing and jewelry at Iranian businesses.\\" There had been initial tensions with Ashkenazi Jews in the synagogues due to cultural misunderstandings and differences in worship patterns, partly because some Iranian Jews did not understand that they needed to assist in fundraising efforts and pay dues. The tensions subsided by 2009. Geography Beverly Hills and the Los Angeles communities of Bel-Air and Brentwood were the destinations of many Iranian immigrants, who were the first immigrant groups to settle in these communities.Bozorgmehr, Der-Martirosian, and Sabagh, \\"Middle Easterners: A New Kind of Immigrant,\\" p. 347. In addition to those places Iranians also live in Santa Monica, West Los Angeles, and Westwood.

By that year many Iranian restaurants and businesses were established in a portion of Westwood Boulevard south of Wilshire Boulevard. In 1990 Ivan Light, a sociologist for the University of California, Los Angeles, stated that the Westwood Boulevard area was the only \\"central location\\" for Iranians in Los Angeles and that they were otherwise dispersed throughout the area. Many Iranians in the Beverly Hills area built large houses that contrast with the original single story bungalows; many Persians stated that the size of Friday Shabbat dinners contributes to their desire to build larger houses. Persian architect Hamid Omrani built around 200 of them. Non-Iranians in the Los Angeles area criticized the houses, calling them \\"Persian palaces,\\" and in 2004 the city council of Beverly Hills addressed the criticisms by establishing a council to examine the designs of new houses; this council could cancel the plans of any new house that is too different from houses around it. In 2017, the Freedom Sculpture was inaugurated on Santa Monica Boulevard near Westwood, described as an Iranian-American led public art project dedicated to the values of freedom, diversity, and inclusiveness. As of 1990 Irvine and the Palos Verdes area had the largest concentrations of Iranian Muslims, and Glendale had a concentration of Iranian Armenians. Economy Iranian Jews and Iranian Muslims included professional workers such as bankers, doctors, and lawyers. As of 1990 Iranian Jews had a tendency of being involved in apparel manufacturing, jewelry manufacturing, and other jobs in the trade sector, while many Iranian Muslims were involved in the construction and real estate development sectors. As of 1990 the Southern California region had 1,600 Iranian professionals and businesses listed in the Iranian Yellow Pages. As of 1996, the self-employment rate of Iranian managers and professionals in Los Angeles was over 50%.Bozorgmehr, Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, \\"Middle Easterners: A New Kind of Immigrant,\\" p. 353. As of 1980, 32% of U.S.-born Armenian and Iranian-born Armenian men 16 and older worked as executives and professionals, and about 33% of the same group worked as craftsmen and operators.Der-Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr, \\"Subethnicity: Armenians in Los Angeles,\\" p. 253. The 1980 self-employment rate of all ethnic Armenians in total was 18% and the percentage of self- employed Iranian Armenians was close to that number. Compared to other Iranian groups, Iranian Armenians had a higher likelihood of economic ties with one another. Most customers and employees of Iranian Armenians who had self- employment were not Armenian and not Iranian, while most business partners of self-employed Iranian Armenians were fellow Iranian Armenians. Der- Martirosian, Sabagh, and Bozorgmehr concluded that the Iranian Armenian ethnicity had a \\"special strength\\".

In 2007 ballots for elections in Beverly Hills began to be printed in Persian. That year, Jimmy Delshad, a Persian Jew, became the mayor of Beverly Hills; he was the city's first mayor of Iranian descent and also the country's highest- ranking political office holder of Persian origins. Culture and recreation Due to the wealth of many Iranian immigrants into Los Angeles, the stereotype that the public had of Iranians were of people who do shopping on Rodeo Drive and drive expensive automobiles. As of 1990 many Iranians do shopping and eat out later than non-Iranians, so many businesses in the Los Angeles area extended their hours to accommodate Iranian customers. Culture shock affected many Iranian families shortly after they arrived in the United States, partly because Iranian men who were accustomed to being the breadwinners and authorities in their households found their power diminished. Initially many Iranian families practiced arranged marriages but by 1990 the practice was declining. As of 2009 many older Iranian women in the Los Angeles area still practice doreh, where they have large gatherings where they enjoy entertainment, talk, and eat. Kevin West of W Magazine stated that the increase in working hours of Iranian women in the region could threaten this custom. As of 1980, 80% of Iranian Armenians have fellow Armenian Iranians at their social gatherings and as spouses and close friends. Circa that year, Iranian Armenian parents had proportionately higher numbers of Armenian friends compared to their children. The Noor Iranian Film Festival is held in the area. Media There is an extensive Iranian media network based in Los Angeles. Dozens of Persian-language satellite channels are produced in the Los Angeles area, with many of them beamed back to Iran. Ghorashi wrote that \\"The major work of the Iranian media network and media in Los Angeles is concentrated on home, past and nostalgia, and strongly nationalistic ideas.\\" The show \\"Shahs of Sunset\\" by the Bravo Channel chronicles Iranians in Los Angeles. It began airing in 2012 and as of 2018 has seven seasons.

It is considered as a therapeutic working concept which defines an intermediate stage between health and disease, which is not quite either status. Human persons who are sub-healthy have any of a range of uncomfortable symptoms but without any obvious and diagnosable illnesses which can be identified through standard medical observation methods. This concept was first presented as \\"the third state\\" by the scholar of former Soviet Union, Berkman, in the mid-1980s.Health Management of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Help You Get Rid of Sub-health (2010). Retrieved March 25, 2014 It is also interpreted as different terms like \\"intermediate state\\", \\"grey state\\" or \\"a general malaise\\". Sub-health is a term which is widely used by Chinese people, or in connection with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Some feel that the notion of SHS has been invented to sell people medical products. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms considered indicators of SHS include aches, chronic fatigue, indigestion, sleep disorders, congestion, nervousness, distraction, nausea, and poor mood. Diagnosis SHS was measured by the suboptimal health questionnaire (SHSQ-25) including 25 items. Each subject was asked to rate a specific statement on a five-point Likert-type scale, based on how often they suffered various specific complaints in the preceding 3 months: (1) never or almost never, (2) occasionally, (3) often, (4) very often, and (5) always. The raw scores of 1 to 5 on the questionnaire were recoded as 0 to 4. SHS scores were calculated for each respondent by summing the ratings for the 25 items. A high score represents a high level of SHS (poor health). The Cronbach’s α coefficient of the SHSQ-25 was 0.91, indicating good internal consistency. The final questionnaire congregated into a score (SHSQ-25) which could significantly distinguish among several abnormal conditions and could be used as a translational medicine instrument for health measuring in the general population. Another criterion for diagnosis of subhealth was defined as the presence of ≥ 1 of the following abnormalities: body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 or waist circumference ≥ 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women; systolic pressure 120-139 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure 80-89 mmHg; serum triglyceride level ≥ 150 mg/dL and/or total cholesterol level ≥ 200 mg/dL and/or high- density lipoprotein cholesterol level < 40 mg/dL in men and 50 mg/dL in women; serum glucose level 110–125 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2; levels of liver enzymes in liver function tests between 41-59 U/L, or with fatty liver disease but < 33% of affected hepatocytes; levels of oxidative stress biomarkers beyond the reference range of 95%; or problems with both sleep quality and psychological state. Population Health Status Engineers have proposed digital, handheld methods for many of those individuals to closely monitor their own health conditions, hoping to get need demands of both SHS groups and aging populations. Such a proposed healthcare system, which can provide self-monitoring of one's health status, early warning of disease, and even an instant report of the physiological signal analysis for individuals, is becoming more and more popular among many Chinese persons for whom it could be made available, in part because its theoretical foundations are based in traditional Chinese medicine.[H. Ding, J. He, and W. Wang, \\"The sub-health evaluation based on the modern diagnostic technique of traditional Chinese medicine,\\" in Proc. Workshop Edu. Technol. Comput. Sci., Shanghai, China, Mar. 7–8, 2009, pp. 269–273.]Wang W, Yan YX, Suboptimal health: a new health dimension for translational medicine SHS is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease. SHS should be recognized in the health care system, especially in primary care. A correlation between SHS and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, plasma glucose, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among men, and a correlation between SHS and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol among women were found. The SHSQ-25 is a self-rated questionnaire of perceived health complaints, which can be used as a new instrument for predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM). An ongoing longitudinal SHS cohort survey (China Sub-optimal Health Cohort Study, COACS) consisting of 50,000 participants will provide a powerful health trial to use SHSQ-25 for its application to PPPM through patient stratification and therapy monitoring using innovative technologies of predictive diagnostics and prognosis: an effort of paradigm shift from reactive to predictive medicine. one study also confirmed the association between chronic psychosocial stress and SHS, indicating that improving the psychosocial work environment may reduce SHS and then prevent chronic diseases effectively. SHS is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Integration of suboptimal health status and endothelial dysfunction provides a novel tool to allow people to get a more holistic picture of both subjective and objective health measures, and also can be applied to routine screening for risks of cardiovascular diseases. To investigate the causative effect of SHS in non- communicable chronic diseases (NCD), China suboptimal health cohort study (COACS), a longitudinal study starting from 2013 was initiated. Phase I of the study involved a cross-sectional survey aimed at identifying the risk/protective factors associated with SHS; and Phase II: a longitudinal yearly follow-up study investigating how SHS contributes to the incidence and pattern of NCD.

Probabilistic classifiers provide classification that can be useful in its own right or when combining classifiers into ensembles. Types of classification Formally, an \\"ordinary\\" classifier is some rule, or function, that assigns to a sample a class label : :\\\\hat{y} = f(x) The samples come from some set (e.g., the set of all documents, or the set of all images), while the class labels form a finite set defined prior to training. Probabilistic classifiers generalize this notion of classifiers: instead of functions, they are conditional distributions \\\\Pr(Y \\\\vert X), meaning that for a given x \\\\in X, they assign probabilities to all y \\\\in Y (and these probabilities sum to one). \\"Hard\\" classification can then be done using the optimal decision rule :\\\\hat{y} = \\\\operatorname{\\\\arg\\\\max}_{y} \\\\Pr(Y=y \\\\vert X) or, in English, the predicted class is that which has the highest probability. Binary probabilistic classifiers are also called binomial regression models in statistics. In econometrics, probabilistic classification in general is called discrete choice. Some classification models, such as naive Bayes, logistic regression and multilayer perceptrons (when trained under an appropriate loss function) are naturally probabilistic. Other models such as support vector machines are not, but methods exist to turn them into probabilistic classifiers. Generative and conditional training Some models, such as logistic regression, are conditionally trained: they optimize the conditional probability \\\\Pr(Y \\\\vert X) directly on a training set (see empirical risk minimization). Other classifiers, such as naive Bayes, are trained generatively: at training time, the class-conditional distribution \\\\Pr(X \\\\vert Y) and the class prior \\\\Pr(Y) are found, and the conditional distribution \\\\Pr (Y \\\\vert X) is derived using Bayes' rule. Probability calibration Not all classification models are naturally probabilistic, and some that are, notably naive Bayes classifiers, decision trees and boosting methods, produce distorted class probability distributions. In the case of decision trees, where is the proportion of training samples with label in the leaf where ends up, these distortions come about because learning algorithms such as C4.5 or CART explicitly aim to produce homogeneous leaves (giving probabilities close to zero or one, and thus high bias) while using few samples to estimate the relevant proportion (high variance). An example calibration plot Calibration can be assessed using a calibration plot (also called a reliability diagram). A calibration plot shows the proportion of items in each class for bands of predicted probability or score (such as a distorted probability distribution or the \\"signed distance to the hyperplane\\" in a support vector machine). Deviations from the identity function indicate a poorly-calibrated classifier for which the predicted probabilities or scores can not be used as probabilities. In this case one can use a method to turn these scores into properly calibrated class membership probabilities. For the binary case, a common approach is to apply Platt scaling, which learns a logistic regression model on the scores. An alternative method using isotonic regression is generally superior to Platt's method when sufficient training data is available. In the multiclass case, one can use a reduction to binary tasks, followed by univariate calibration with an algorithm as described above and further application of the pairwise coupling algorithm by Hastie and Tibshirani. Evaluating probabilistic classification Commonly used loss functions for probabilistic classification include log loss and the Brier score between the predicted and the true probability distributions. The former of these is commonly used to train logistic models. A method used to assign scores to pairs of predicted probabilities and actual discrete outcomes, so that different predictive methods can be compared, is called a scoring rule.

Youngcare's programs and projects focus on supporting young people with a disability by providing greater choice in housing and care options. Currently, there are over 6,200 young people with high care needs living in residential aged care facilities. Common types of disability of those supported by Youngcare include cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis or an acquired brain injury. Mission Youngcare believe that every young person deserves to live a young life, regardless of their care needs. To ensure every young Australian is living their lives to the full, Youngcare provides accommodation, grants and offers support and information via the Youngcare Connect phone service.  History  Youngcare inspiration Shevaune Conry and founders David Conry, Nick Bonifant, Matt Lawson and Simon LockyerFounded in 2005, Youngcare was born out of a woman's battle to find relevant and dignified care. Youngcare's inspiration, Shevaune Conry, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998 aged 26. By age 33, her husband and Youngcare founder, David Conry, could no longer provide the care that Shevaune needed on a 24-hour basis. After searching for an age- appropriate care provider, Shevaune was forced to move into aged care. It was this experience of the disability system that drove David, with co-founders Nick Bonifant, Matthew Lawson and Simon Lockyer, to create Youngcare and provide choice to young people who require full-time care. Shevaune died in August 2012 at age 40.  Projects  =Apartments= The first major project completed by Youngcare was a building of 17 individual apartments for people with significant physical disabilities. This project was in response to the number of people with disability living in residential aged care due to the lack of alternative housing options. With community and corporate support, the Youngcare Wesley Mission Queensland Apartments in Sinnamon Park, Queensland opened its doors in 2007. Along with housing young people with high care needs, the aim of the apartments was to provide a replicable model of care as an alternative to institutionalised housing. This model of care is supported and enhanced through research conducted in partnership with Griffith University. Youngcare Apartments Sinnamon Park In 2012, the second Youngcare Apartments were opened on the Gold Coast, Queensland, housing seven residents in separate units. In July 2015, the Youngcare Wooloowin Share House opened its doors for the first time, with the four new housemates living with more independence and choice than ever before. The Share House is equipped with innovative technology, where lighting, audio, visual, automated doors and blinds are at the touch of a fingertip, allowing for optimal independence. Most recently in June 2017, the Youngcare and MS Queensland Apartments at Albany Creek were officially opened, where eight young people with high care needs call “home”. The two-bedroom apartments are ideal for the eight new residents who can now have their family and friends stay overnight or use the spare room as a study. = At Home Care Grants = The Youngcare At Home Care Grants program began in 2009 and provides grants between $2000 and $10,000 for young people with high care needs that are deemed to be at high risk of entering an aged care facility. Youngcare has facilitated over $5,000,000 of funding, with successful applications for items such as essential home modifications, equipment and in-home support. By 2013 the Youngcare At Home Care Grants program had grown to include application rounds for Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, Northern Territory, South Australia and Victorian Residents. = Youngcare Connect = The Youngcare Connect phone line aims to connect young people with high care needs and their families and carers to relevant support from the Government and the wider health care services sector. Information provided can include appropriate accommodation options, respite, local service providers, funding options, and social and recreational support.

Their first album, An Element of Surprise, was released in December 2011. The album was subsequently released on ArtistAloud.com to cater to Indian audiences, and within two weeks of release, three singles reached the top of the radioandmusic.com charts. In February 2013, the band toured India and performed two shows each in Mumbai and Chennai. The band signed to Universal Music India in February 2014. After a brief hiatus and a series of changes in the lineup, Vin Sinners regrouped in 2017. Vin Nair along with the new band consisting of Michael Schiller on lead guitars, DJ Praful (ex-Millennium) on bass guitars, Josh on rhythm guitars and keyboards and Thomas Mielenz on drums & percussion worked on their new album called VS III. VS III was released on April 22, 2020. The release was an independent release as the contract with Universal had run out in 2017. History =Early Years= Vin Sinners was formed by Chennai-based Vin Nair who decided to make a comeback to music after a 15-year sabbatical. Nair had toyed with the idea of forming a band for years after his earlier band called Acanthus disbanded in 1994. He had earlier been a part of the church choir at Montfort Higher Secondary School in South India and it is there that he did most of his singing. In 2009, Vin who was inspired by the Indian movie Rock On!! that depicted a corporate professional making a comeback to the music scene after a few years away. However, it was in 2010 that Vin met Pakistan- born Atif Ali who owns and runs a production studio called Playback Lounge in Dubai. On May 23, 2010, Atif and Vin decided to work on one song as an experiment. The song, called \\"The Wise Man\\", was written by Vin in memory of his late father, and the song was produced in less than three days. Atif and Vin began work on more songs along with Tabraiz Haroon (Mr T) on keyboards. =First album - An Element of Surprise= An Element of Surprise was launched on Dec 9, 2011 in Dubai. The production of 'An Element of Surprise' was largely a solo project with session musicians and it was only towards the end of the production that Vin Sinners as a band started to take shape. Being an independent release, the album was given respectable ratings by the now defunked Rolling Stone Middle East. Three of the album's songs made it to the weekly Top 3 spots of the www.radioandmusic.com charts =India Tour February 2013= In July 2013, Vin Sinners’ first album was released in India via digital music platform artistaloud.com. This coupled with the band's first video release on YouTube for the song 'Return to Solace' saw the band's popularity in India increase. Soon after playing at the Gulf Bike Festival in October 2012, Vin Sinners announced that they had begun work on their new album and were also planning an International tour. Vin Sinners toured India with 2 shows each in Mumbai and Chennai. The concerts were received well. In December 2013, Vin Sinners announced that their new album would feature former Iron Maiden front-man Blaze Bayley on a track called ‘Open The Box’. The track features both Vin Nair and Blaze Bayley on vocals. = Signing to Universal Music & Second Album - A Mighty Black Box = On February 19, 2014, Universal Music India signed a 3-year contract with the band and it became the first UAE based rock band to be signed by a major label. On April 5, 2014, the band released their album called 'A Mighty Black Box' at a concert held at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dubai, UAE. Soon after, the album was made available in physical format at stores across the Middle East and India. = 2014-2018 = Soon after the band's 2nd album launch, the band did a few concerts through to the end of 2014. By the end of that year, Vin Nair announced that the band was taking a sabbatical and would look to regroup when the time was 'right'. In interviews later, he said that he had continued to write material with a few musicians. DJ Praful, a childhood friend of Vin Nair who is based in Bengaluru and was former bassist of India's heavy metal band, Millennium joined Vin Sinners. In 2016, the band released a single called 'Turn down the Hate' that featured new musicians along with Nair. The song would eventually find a place on the album VS III in 2020. The band albeit with an all-new line-up except for Vin Nair, performed at a few concerts including Aldo Rock Festival held in memory of former Vin Sinners lead guitarist, Aldo Rock who passed away in 2017. By this time, Josh had joined the band and along with Vin, began to write a lot of new material. In September 2017, Vin Sinners performed at the United for Marawi Festival held to raise funds for the victims of the Marawi conflict in The Philippines. By the end of 2018, a new-look, Vin Sinners had taken shape with Vin Nair (aka Big Daddy Vin) on vocals, Josh on rhythm guitars and keyboards, Michael Schiller on lead guitars, DJ Praful on bass guitars and Thomas Mielenz on drums & percussion. = Trinity of Sin - EP = While the band worked on a full length studio album, it was decided that an EP called 'Trinity of Sin' would be released as a precursor to the band's evolving sound. It would comprise three tracks, namely 'Hail Ya Sinners I' (originally released in the first album), Hail Ya Sinners II (originally released on the 2nd album) and an all new Hail Ya Sinners III that would feature the new band. The EP was released in November 2019 and a lyrics video was released for the new song. = Third Studio Album - VS III = The band continued to work on completing their 3rd full length studio album. Now working with a new producer, Irfan Omar from IQ Lifestyle Studios, the band had set a date of release for April 22, 2020. The 11 song record called VS III was released on that date and was made available on digital channels across the world including Spotify, Amazon, Apple Music, Anghami, GooglePlay to name a few. Present On July 10, 2020, Vin Sinners announced they would be releasing a new single called 'Lockdown Lie'. A release date has not yet been announced.

Description It is located about north of Yalgoo and north east of Kalbarri in the Mid West region of Western Australia. Mount Narryer occupies an area of leasehold and freehold with a carrying capacity of 11,000 sheep. Situated along the Murchison River, the property is broken into 18 paddocks of mulga scrubland with one permanent spring, four dams and 40 bores equipped with windmills. The station is named after Mount Narryer, a large rocky outcrop. Homestead The current homestead is listed on the Register of the National Estate as an historic place. The buildings are not typical of the local area, with the architect designed elaborate house and impressive shearing shed both built from local stone. It was built when Charles Atkins, who also owned the Palace Hotel in Perth, owned the property. The original homestead was built by Isaac Tyson near Mount Narryer itself. A second homestead was built in 1900 near the current house, and the ruins can still be seen from the present one. History Mount Narryer Station was established about 1880. By 1897 Isaac Tyson was the owner and was growing a small plot of cotton near the homestead. In 1909 the property had been acquired by the Aitkins brothers, who owned large tracts of land in the area. By 1925 the property occupied an area of approximately and had an estimated carrying capacity of 25,000 sheep. The old stock had been eliminated at it was stocked with about 9,000 ewes. The McTaggart family have owned the property and been running cattle since 1980, but placed the property on the market in 2014 after suffering through drought, the stress of feral goats, wild dogs and finding staff. The property was placed on the market in 2014 for 1.5 million. The price included the five bedroom stone homestead, three bedroom cottage, three bedroom outcamp, five stand stone shearing shed, cattle yard, hangar, and shearers' quarters.

The parish's history is closely linked with that of Castellan, and included parts of the present villages of Blaenffos and Crymych. History =Church= The parish, in the 1530s, was unique in Wales in furnishing the title of a suffragan see, namely Bishop of Penrydd, and an Inventory of Ancient Monuments explains how this may have come about. The parish is marked (as Penrith) on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. Abandoned Penrydd parish church The parish church of St Cristiolus (Church in Wales) existed at least as early as 1799, the earliest date from which parish register information has been garnered. From 1799 to 1858 the parish register is \\"Penrhydd with Castellan\\", Castellan being a chapelry at that time. The living in 1870 was described as \\"...a rectory in the diocese of St David's. Value £100. Patron, the Lord Chancellor\\". The church had been rebuilt in 1841 and restored in 1911; in 1914 it was described as \\"plain\\" and \\"whitewashed\\". A survey by Dyfed Archaeological Trust for Cadw in 2011 describes the present churchyard as \\"...suboval/subrectangular, now poorly defined...\\" and the church as \\"...small, comprising chancel, nave and west porch. It is now in private hands...\\". The church was described in about 2012 as abandoned. =Population and property= The annual value of the Real property of the parish, including Castellan, was £756 in 1815 when the joint population was 273. By 1821 and 1831 the population of Penrydd parish alone was 190 and 219 respectively. In 1831-33 the parish (including the chapelry of Castellan) was home to 346 inhabitants and included both enclosed arable land or pasture and unenclosed moorland. About 70% of males over 20 were involved in agriculture with the rest in retail or manufacturing trades. Of those in agriculture, the majority farmed in their own right, as opposed to labouring for others. Tithe apportionments of 1837 and tithe maps of 1844 are held at the National Archives. By 1881 the majority of males (about 60%) were still in agriculture, but there were more involved in other occupations such as quarrying. There is an Ordnance Survey-marked disused quarry close to Castellan Farm. Penrydd was included in the National Farm Survey of 1941-3 during World War 2, the records of which are held at the National Archives. Today Penrydd was absorbed in 1974 into the community of Boncath.

Dick. Written and directed by and the feature film directorial debut of Matthew Wilder, it stars Bill Pullman and Taryn Manning in the lead roles. Plot During the summer of 1974, science-fiction writer William J. Frick (Bill Pullman) is having a meltdown. Despite having numerous popular titles to his credit, Frick is penniless. His ex-wives and ex-girlfriends are hounding him, and the IRS has sent Agent Duke (Dave Sheridan) to investigate his property and holdings. Bikers are mixing meth in his garage and having drug parties in his home. His final masterpiece, an account of his collision with God in an East L.A. taco stand, is nearly complete and actress Nikki Principal (Taryn Manning) encourages his writing, telling him that it has the power to change the world. However, after an inadvertent dose of a powdery white substance, Frick wakes up to discover himself lost in a series of alternate realities. Cast * Bill Pullman as William J.

While still being referred to as Panasonic, it was announced in July 2006 that filming would begin the following August. However, filming actually took place in September, captured on Digicam HD during a 15-day period that month in Huntington Park and other Los Angeles locations. The project was in post- production in 2007, with its name changed to Your Name here. The project premiered June 13, 2008 at the Cinevegas Film Festival, and later screened in Spain at the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival and in Canada at the Montréal World Film Festival. Critical response The reviewer at JoBlo panned the film, writing that it was a \\"sad sack excuse for a movie didn’t help me start my day on a good foot\\". He expanded that the film's characters were bland and it never expanded on their backgrounds. It was offered that the film's jumping \\"in and out of was obviously NOT a true reality\\" made it difficult to become invested in the project. It was felt that Traci Lord's character of Frick's foul-mouthed former-wife Julie was funny at first but was overdone to the point of no longer being entertaining. Bill Pullman was praised for bringing his ability to an otherwise stale role of Frick as was Taryn Manning for her work as Nikki, but what ruined the film for the reviewer was it being a \\"rinse and repeat, go everywhere yet nowhere jamboree of snoozes.\\" The reviewer decried the \\"low-rent, crappy locations\\", the film's repeated use of \\"mind-f*ck clichés\\", and the overall \\"sad-sack\\" cinematography. Variety agreed, writing the film \\"flubs an opportunity for a full-bore B-movie romp in a series of overextended, flat episodes\\" by director Matthew Wilder who allowed too many scenes to run overlong. Las Vegas Weekly noted that Pullman's character of Frick looked like Michael Douglas and bemoaned that his \\"acting is fine, but it’s got no context\\" while at the same time noting that Traci Lords gives \\"what is probably her career-best performance as, ironically, a frumpy housewife.\\" They also noted that with its relatively small budget \\"the production has a curious emptiness to it, as if it were all shot in one abandoned warehouse hastily redressed for each new locale\\". They concluded the film was a disservice to Philip K. Dick's legacy. The Hollywood Reporter appreciated that Bill Pullman was cast in a role where he was \\"able to stretch in a vehicle that showcases his unappreciated comic talents\\", but offered that the film \\"ultimately proves too impenetrable for its own good.\\" Conversely, Film Threat granted that while the project was \\"not for everyone\\", it reminded \\"of some odd literary films like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Naked Lunch,\\" and promised viewers that \\"if you stick with Your Name Here until the end, you will be rewarded. For all its oddities and confusion, the ending come across as very powerful and quite sad.\\" It was appreciated that in the film's extrapolating from events surrounding the life of Philip K. Dick, it acted as an homage both to the man's fiction and to the 1970s. They praised Taryn Manning for showing \\"some serious acting chops as Nikki and described Bill Pullman's Frick as \\"simply brilliant. You can almost see the fried wheels in his brain spinning as he, along with we, try to figure out what the heck is going on.\\" =Awards and nominations= * 2008, won Cinevegas 'Special Jury Prize' for 'Best Performance' for Bill Pullman * 2008, nominated for 'Grand Prix des Amériques' at Montréal World Film Festival * 2008, nominated for 'Best Film' at Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival References External links * Your Name Here at the Internet Movie Database * Your Name Here at the Rotten Tomatoes Category:Philip K.

Pennsylvania charter schools have the same academic accountability as traditional public schools and must give the PSSAs to their pupils each year, working to achieve AYP status. According to PA Charter School law, if more students apply to attend than there are open slots available, Charter Schools are required to use a random lottery system to select new incoming students. According to the Charter School law, siblings (brothers and sisters), and children of individuals who help establish a charter school, are granted an “admissions preference.” Students residing in the Allentown School District are selected first, according to the number of slots available for Allentown students. If there is space available for more students, seats will be declared open for out-of-District students.

A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Allentown School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Allentown School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates for Allentown School District are Elementary School - $7,803.88, High School - $9,858.67. For students who reside in other local school districts, their home school district pays its mandated tuition rate to Lincoln Leadership. Wellness policy Lincoln Leadership Academy Charter School established a school wellness policy in 2009.Lincoln Leadership Academy Charter School Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy, 2009 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, schools must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, schools were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Lincoln Leadership Academy Charter School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low- income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. Lincoln Leadership Academy Charter School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day.

Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In addition, a dental health program is conducted with HealthStar II – Mobile Dental Service. Grants In addition to tuition payments, Lincoln Leadership Academy Charter School applied for several grants to increase its funding. Both the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Federal government offer several education grants each year. =Federal Stimulus grant= Lincoln Leadership Academy Charter School received an extra $69,795 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one time expenditures like: acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. =Race to the Top grant= Lincoln Leadership Academy Charter School officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided nearly one half million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant.

It is served in most regions of Uganda and is defined as a mixture of ingredients. The main ingredients of the dish are matooke and a sauce (beef, ghee, offal, beans)  Origins  Katogo originated from Buganda and Western Uganda, where it was initially perceived as a poor man's dish. There is no exact chronology as to when Ugandans started cooking katogo, but as long as matooke has been around, so has katogo. The Baganda came up with the katogo dish which is a combination of offal and matooke. Katogo was originally a combination of diced cassava mixed with beans. This was the poor man's meal. The upper classes, introduced matooke to replace cassava and later versions of katogo brought on offals and other new sauces. The popularity of katogo quickly spread all over Uganda and to date there are many variations of the cuisine. It is a common delicacy among the Bantu speaking communities and most of Uganda’s urban communities. It is now available in most restaurants and hotels, served as breakfast.  Recipes  There are various recipes for this dish but the most popular is the one where matooke is the staple and the sauce is offal known as byenda in Uganda. The culinary term for byenda (offal) is tripe and sweetbreads which are the inner lining of the stomach, the thymus gland and the pancreas respectively. The peeled matooke (green bananas) are cooked in the prepared sauce of byenda (offals) until the matooke is ready. Katogo is usually served with cooked greens and fruit juice.  Cooking method  The process of cooking is done by braising the sauce (offal, beef, ground peanuts or beans) which is brought to a boil and later simmered until it is ready. The sauce is then poured over the peeled matoke and left to simmer until the matooke is ready. Katogo takes a relatively short time to prepare and today most people use wood or charcoal as a cooking fuel.  Variations  The variations of this dish include a staple (matooke, Irish potatoes, cassava or sweet potatoes) which is cooked in the same pot with a sauce (beef, offal, beans, peas, groundnuts or greens).

He always refuted the prevailing trends of the day so as to create and distinguish his own individual style: this may explain why Devalle has often been overlooked and placed as something of an outsider. He has been known as a master of photomontage and defined as a creator of the 'New Epic Italian style'. Early life and experiences Devalle was born in Turin on 8 April 1940. During the war his family first evacuated to Cherasco, the birthplace of his paternal grandparents, and then to Lanzo Torinese, from 1943-1945. On returning to Turin in 1945, he attended elementary and then secondary school without much enthusiasm. In 1955 he was admitted to the Liceo Artistico dell’Accademia Albertina, after having studied all summer with the Casoni brothers, on the advice of Felice Casorati, whom he had met through common friends of his parents. During the years of his attendance at the Liceo, he came in contact with the avant-garde world of contemporary art, thanks to his acquaintance with sculptors, Sandro Cherchi and Franco Garelli. He frequented the USIS Library in Turin, and in 1958 he went to the PAC in Milan, to see the exhibition of American painting; a visit which marked the beginning of his interest in Gorky and particularly in abstract expressionism. In 1958 he was admitted to the annual Promotrice delle Belle Arti in Turin. He completed his diploma at the Liceo and then, for a few years, worked as a cost estimator in his father's firm, which specialised in metal structural work. At the same time, he enrolled in the Accademia Albertina, taking a course in stage design. The first outcome of this decision was his coming into contact with the thinking and aesthetics of contemporary theatre (Beckett, Ionesco, Albee, etc.). Career = Beginnings 1961–72 = Garden Party, 1965, Cariplo Foundation In 1961, in an exhibition with Gianluigi Mattia, he exhibited large-scale works at the Circolo degli Artisti. In the same year, Holden Caulfield—the protagonist of J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye—became his favorite and ideal character is a series of pastels, along with Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll during 1962–63. In 1963, Bompiani Almanac (dedicated to American Pop Art), the exhibition held at the gallery Il Punto of Remo Pastori and Gianenzo Sperone, and above all, the friendship with Michelangelo Pistoletto, spurred him to make direct use of photographic images. In particular, he used the pages of magazines like Look, Life, L'Espresso, and Paris Match, in which enquiries, documentaries, and ads all co-existed; anticipating television, which was still structured along theatrical lines. Thus he created his first photomontages. In 1963 he graduated from Accademia Albertina and was immediately invited to various important exhibits, among which Alternative attuali; L'Aquila; the Tokyo Biennale; and the museum of Ixelles, Brussels. In 1964 his Alice in Wonderland sheets and his large scale acrylic-Pop painting are on a Solo Exhibition at the prestigious Galleria Galatea of Turin, under the curation of Luigi Carluccio. In the following years, Devalle took part in the first Mostra Mercato held in the halls of the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, and in 1965 another Solo Exhibition at the Galleria Milano, Milan, where he exhibited a new series of acrylic and coloured pencil works. In those years Devalle also received various prizes, among which: the Città di Torino Giovani, the F.P. Michetti Prize (1963–64), the Città di Spoleto Prize (1963), and the San Fedele Prize (1966). In 1965 he was a guest of the XXXIII Venice Biennale by Nello Ponente. In the same year he started to paint the Room-Landscapes (paesaggi-stanza), placing extensions of the paintings—parallelepipeds, tetrahedrons, and pyramids—next to canvases in order to modify the apparent placement of the painting, putting it in relation to the room containing it. In 1967, he took part in the touring Salone Internazionale dei Giovani organised by the PAC, and curated by Guido Ballo. He presented these large scale tridimensional acrylic painting in a series of important one-man exhibitions: at the Studio d'Arte Condotti in Rome; at the Galleria Blu in Milan; at the La Nuova Loggia in Bologna; and at Christian Stein, Turin. This period concluded with the exhibition of his last \\"room-works\\" at the XXXVI Venice Biennale in 1972. = Photomontages 1972–83 = In the late 1960s Devalle put aside large-scale works and acrylic colours and began to work with photomontages. He used pictures taken from fashion magazines, instead of from news magazines as in his works of 1963–1969. Through rigorous use of geometry, Devalle explored the faces and figures he appropriated from magazines, to produce new structural frameworks, the results of which Devalle called \\"real surprises\\". Invited by Renato Barilli, Tommaso Trini and Maurizio Calvesi, he participated in Gennaio '70, the Biennale of young Bolognese artists; in Arte e Critica, in Modena, following a recommendation by Renato Barilli; in Environment, a documentary show organized by the Italian section of UNESCO in Paris (\\"Farfalla Night!\\", 1970, \\"Greta Garbo Galà\\", 1971). After an empirical beginning, which lasted from 1963 to 1970, Devalle began to utilize geometry in a much more systematic way, for executional precision and truth in design obsessed him. Along with this work with photography there appeared tables that developed the creative process—real diaries of the sequence. Orthogonals, diagonals, and curves became autonomous subjects and in themselves created \\"effective surprises\\" (\\"Dal quadrato al cerchio\\", 1974, \\"Cinque quadrate in un quadrato\\", 1973). In 1973 he held the chair of Theory of Perception at the Accademia Albertina in Turin. His works were shown by Daniela Palazzoli and Luigi Carluccio at the exhibition Combattimenti per una imagine at the Modern Art Gallery of Turin. This participation presented Devalle in an international framework, putting him in contact with other artists experimenting with the manipulation of photography such as Robert Heinechen and John Baldessari. In 1975 the fashion images of the illustrated magazines were for the most part replaced by snapshots taken by himself or photographs of his family, of which photocopies were then made (that very same year, photocopying became a commercialised service in Italy). This latter work led him to use graphite and charcoal instead of the previous India ink-rotogravure combination. Carbon was not only the surrogate of the toner used in photocopying machines, but at the same time the \\"historical\\" material utilised in operations involving the transformation and integration of a photocopied image. The photographic transfers used in the beginning as a quick solution for everyday duplications—temporary phases on glossy paper or on PVC—made Devalle realize that those \\"designs\\" were not only measurable shapes and transfers, but also \\"ready\\", autonomous, and definitive results. In 1976 he was appointed chair of Theory of Perception at the Brera Academy in Milan where he relocated in 1979. He became regular Professor of Painting in 1980. Life drawing lessons. In 1979 Regione Piemonte dedicated to him his first anthological exhibition, edited by Paolo Fossati, Maria Cristina Gozzoli, Marco Rosci and Paride Chiapatti, at Palazzo Chiablese in Turin. In 1982 he was guest of the Venice Biennale and of the London Hayward Gallery with the exhibition \\"Italian Art 1960–1982\\". = Return to life drawing 1983–90 = \\"Le Corbusier (second version)\\" by Beppe Devalle, 1988 Suddenly, towards the end of 1983, Devalle dropped photography, which he had begun to find too restrictive a partner and reverted to drawing with a model, recovering pre-avant grade historical movements working techniques, thus trying to find his personal position between traditional and modernity. He then began a new cycle of work: Ritratti (portraits) and Nature morte (still-lives) from life, executed in coloured pencils and pastel crayons. In 1983 he had a solo exhibition at the Galleria Lorenzelli. From 1985 to 1987 he made the designs for the Cultura inserts of the Corriere della Sera, the Milanese daily. In 1986 he was guest of the XV Quadriennale di Roma with a Solo Exhibition. In 1987 he exhibited at the Feltrinelli Bookshop in Milan and, in 1988 at the Galleria Documenta of Turin and at the Galleria Nuova, Bologna. = Contemporary icons and large formats 1990–2000 = The early 1990s found Devalle enriched by his experiences in designing from life (1983–1989). He returned to using photographs and collages, as a new way of creating stories; a process which was also strongly influenced by the experience he had gained working for the Corriere della Sera. The photomontages were studies that would later give him new ideas for large-scale canvases. In 1992 he transferred his studio to Pessano, an industrial site in Brianza. In the same year, Paolo Biscottini organized his second anthological exhibition at the Serrone di Villa Reale in Monza, with a catalogue tracing his artistic progress starting from the sixties (the catalogue is edited with Dario Trento, Maria Mimita Lamberti for Edizioni Charta, Milano). During those years Devalle painted on big-scale canvases choosing his subjects amongst iconic figures taken from contemporary history, such as Ayatollah Khomeini and the writer Salman Rushdie (in the Solo Exhibition at the Galleria Lorenzelli, Milan 1992), and events from crime news, such as the murder of the tourist Barbara Meller in Miami (A Tourist Trap, edited by Marco Rosci, with text by Giulio Palmieri, Edizioni Charta, 1994; in his solo exhibition at the Circolo degli Artisti, Turin 1995, edited by Marco Rosci). The solo exhibition of 1996, Nomi Blasfemi, edited by Maria Mimita Lamberti and presented at the Palazzo Massari in Ferrara and curated by Maria Mimita Lamberti, showed collages and paintings that represented some topical characters through holy texts and pictorial tradition. In 1997 Devalle left the Chair of Painting at the Brera Academy and moved to New York, for the first of a long series of journeys to the United States. In 1998, \\"Monaci\\", edited by Dario Trento, was on exhibition the Murazzi del Po, Turin. A monographic volume on the collages of the 1970s was published in 1998 by Allemandi Editore and edited by Maria Mimita Lamberti: \\"DEVALLE: Photomontages 1968–1983\\". In 1999 he moved from Queens to Manhattan. In the summer of the same year Devalle exhibited the fifty one-collages of the \\"STAMP-OUT\\" cycle, edited by Dario Trento, at the Salara of Bologna. = Last act 2000–2013 = In the summer of 2002, Devalle produced the volume US with Giulio Palmieri and Nicoletta Vallorani, dedicated to the paintings realized in the United States. In 2003 he returned to Italy. Fame (2004), curated by Giovanni Romano, followed the earlier \\"STAMP-OUT\\" and \\"US\\", featuring the artist's stories and obsessions. In April 2006 the Modern Art Gallery (GAM) of Turin exhibited three large canvases (\\"Salvatore\\" 1995, \\"Nasdaq\\", 2000–01, \\"Pierrot and Arlequin\\", 2003) purchased by the De Fornaris Foundation. In the summer of 2007, Devalle exhibited, at the Museo Diocesano in Milan, Happy Times, one of the 14 paintings dedicated to the theme of suicide in the cycle For.Video by Taiana Alessandro, Italia, 2005, 12’24’’ In April 2008 the library of the Brera Academy hosted an anthological exhibition showcasing selected collages created between 1962 and 2007. During the summer of 2008, the Museo Diocesano staged the exhibition You are my destiny,Exhibit video that presented a selection of large-scale canvases of the series For and Beauty and a number of portraits and studies of smaller dimensions. The catalogue of this exhibition (edition Silvana) collects essays by Carlo Bertelli, Paolo Biscottini, Flavio Fergonzi, Maria Mimita Lamberti, Giovanni Romano and Dario Trento. In 2012, thirteen collages of the 1960s, selected by Flavio Fergonzi, were showcased in the exhibition Beppe Devalle, Collages of the Sixties by the Museo del Novecento Video Exhibit, Rai News. On 4 February 2013, Beppe Devalle died in Milan after suffering a long illness. On 15 May 2013, the Brera Academy commemorated the artist with a conference named L'arte è violenta come la vita (\\"Art is as violent as life\\")http://www.accademiadibrera.milano.it/it/larte-è-violenta-come-la- vita.html Interview RAI.

Degrees  His undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees from Duke University, are in electrical engineering. He also holds a D. Science degree from the University of Warwick and a D. Engineering degree from University of Technology Sydney. In addition, he has been awarded honorary doctorates from Uppsala University and from the University of Salamanca.  Neural prosthesis research  His initial research projects investigated sound source localization in humans and bats and the effects of microwave radiation on the auditory system. In 1977, he began work as a research engineer at the Research Triangle Institute (RTI). He was the head of the RTI Neuroscience Program 1983–1994, the director of the Center for Auditory Prosthesis Research 1994–2002, and was a Senior Fellow 2002–07. In 1983, Wilson received the first of seven contracts (1983–2005) from the Neural Prosthesis Branch of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to investigate sound coding strategies for cochlear implants. This long period of continuous funding allowed him to investigate multiple signal coding strategies. The best known is the high-rate, continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) processor.Wilson, B. S., Finley, C. C., Lawson, D. T., Wolford, R. D., Eddington, D. K., and Rabinowitz, W. M. (1991). \\"Better speech recognition with cochlear implants,\\" Nature 352, 236-238. Among many other features, CIS presents non-simultaneous pulses to the different electrodes in the implant, which greatly reduces deleterious interactions, or crosstalk, among the electrodes. Other signal coding strategies developed and implemented in his laboratory include predecessors of the Fine Structure Processing (FSP, FS4) strategies and of the Fidelity120 virtual channel strategy. In collaboration with Cochlear Americas, Duke University and the NIH, Wilson's group also developed and evaluated a high pulse rate, channel-picking strategy. A direct outcome was the advanced combination encoder, or ACE strategy.

It is one of the greatest religious events in the city and the longest chariot festival celebrated in the country. Buṅga Dyaḥ is also known as Raktalokitesvara Karunamaya and Rāto Machhindranāth and is revered as the giver of rain. The name Rato Machhendranath means Red Machhendranath in a reference to the color of the deity's image. The chariot festival is held according to the lunar calendar, so the date is changeable. It begins on the 4th day of the bright fortnight of Bachhalā, the seventh month in the lunar Nepal Sambat calendar. Chariot procession The chariot procession was instituted to celebrate the arrival of Bunga Dyah in Nepal and the end of a devastating drought. It was started when Narendra Deva was the king (640-683 AD). Preparations for the festival begin with the construction of a 60-foot tall chariot at Pulchok at the western end of Lalitpur. When the chariot is complete, the image of Bunga Dyah from his temple is installed in it. Revellers then drag the chariot through the streets of Lalitpur on a tour that lasts a month. The chariot of Bunga Dyah is accompanied on the journey by a similar but smaller chariot of Chākuwā Dyah (चाकुवा द्यः). The deity is another Bodhisattva and is also known as Minnāth. The route of the chariot procession starts at Pulchok and passes through Gabahal, Mangal Bazar, Hakha, Sundhara, Chakrabahil, Lagankhel and ends at Jawalakhel. As per time-honored tradition, the chariot is pulled exclusively by women on the stretch between the localities of Iti and Thati. This part of the chariot procession is known as Yākah Misāyā Bhujyā (याकः मिसाया भुज्या). The parade finishes at the open ground of Jawalakhel which is situated at the western side of Lalitpur. There, the festivities conclude with the ceremony of Bhoto Jatra, the display of the bhoto, a traditional Nepalese vest. During the \\"Barha Barsa Jatra\\", that happens once in every 12 years, the chariot of the Machhindranath is constructed at Bungamati. The chariot is pulled all the way from Bungamati through Bhaisepati, Nakkhu, Bhanimandal, Jhamsikhel and to Pulchowk. The chariot is pulled from Jhamsikhel (near Ideal Model School) to Pulchowk at night. Then the chariot is pulled through the town at its normal route. After the Bhoto Jatra ceremony at Jawalakhel, the idol of Rato Machhindranath is taken back to Bungamati, where it spends the 6 months of the year.  Bhoto Jatra  Showing the vest to the crowds on Bhoto Jatra Bhoto Jatra, which literally means \\"vest festival\\", is the climax of the chariot procession of Bunga Dyah Jatra. As per Nepal Bhasa the Jatra should be considered as Pwaklo Jatra because Pwaklo refers to Vest while Bhoto has sleeves. After the two chariots arrive in Jawalakhel, astrologers choose an auspicious date to hold the Bhoto Jatra festival. On the appointed day in the presence of the head of state, a government official climbs on to the chariot and holds up a jewel- studded black vest from the four sides of the chariot so that all the people gathered around can have a look at it. The display is a re-enactment of an event that happened eons ago. According to legend, a Jyapu (Newar farmer) lost the vest which he had received as a gift from the serpent god Karkotaka Naga for doing him a favour. There are two legends of the favor one of them being the Jyapu providing him some ayurvedic herbs by examining the ill wife of Karkotaka Naga which healed her. Another legend says that the Jayapu was frightened when Karkotaka Naga asked for some herbs to cure his ill wife so the Jyapu who didn't have any idea regarding herbs gave him his own 'khiti'(dirts from his sweaty body) that healed her. One day, the farmer had come to Jawalakhel to watch the chariot pulling festival where he saw someone wearing his missing garment. A quarrel developed over the vest, and since neither party could prove ownership, it was agreed that the undershirt would be kept with Bunga Dyah until the rightful owner comes to claim it with adequate proof. Since then, the vest has been shown to the public annually as a call to potential claimants to step forward. The living goddess Kumari of Patan also arrives in Jawalakhel to observe Bhoto Jatra. She watches the ceremony from a special rest house. The auspicious day when the Bhoto Jatra is held is determined by astrologers, so the date is changeable. In 2014, the vest showing will be held on 22 June. After the festival, the chariot is dismantled and the parts are stored until it is time for the procession the next year. Rato Machhendranath is taken to a temple in the nearby village of Bungamati, also known as the second home of the rain god. The deity spends the next six months in that temple.

Lord Hawke selected a cricket team of ten amateurs and two professional players to tour Australia and New Zealand from November 1902 until March 1903. After an opening game in San Francisco, the tour began of eighteen matches - seven of them considered first-class - in New Zealand followed by three further first-class games in Australia. Hawke's team was the first to tour Australasia with New Zealand as the primary destination and,Ryan p. 166. as was the norm at the time, was privately run and funded. The Australian leg of the tour was a \\"profit making venture\\", however the games in New Zealand were scheduled at the behest of the New Zealand Cricket Board in order to raise the profile of cricket in the country. Two of them were against a New Zealand cricket team, before its international Test status. The inclusion of such games on the tour were considered \\"a sign that cricket in New Zealand was starting to be taken more seriously, and a move towards official international status was possible.\\" Hawke's team was a strong one, including Pelham Warner, Bernard Bosanquet and Frederick Fane, and it was victorious in all eighteen matches of the New Zealand tour, though it was defeated in two of the three matches in Australia. Hawke's team Hawke had intended to captain the team, but was unable to make the tour after breaking his collarbone the day before the team left England. Hawke asked Warner to captain the team, which was referred to throughout as \\"Lord Hawke's team\\". The team was as follows: Warner opened the batting; his opening partner was Cambridge University alumni and MCC cricketer Cuthbert Burnup, a right-handed batsman and useful right-arm slow bowler; Fane, a right-handed batsman for England and Essex; Tom Taylor, a Yorkshire right-hand batsman and wicketkeeper; Edward Dowson, of Surrey; leading all-round cricketer Bosanquet; George Thompson of Northamptonshire and John Stanning of the MCC; Randall Johnson of the MCC; Arthur Whatman who also kept wicket; Albert Leatham and Sam Hargreave. Nat Williams, who was living in New Zealand at the time, played in seven of the minor matches in New Zealand when members of the original team were injured or otherwise unavailable. The tour The team stopped in California in the United States on their way to New Zealand, playing against a California XI at the Presidio Athletic Ground in San Francisco in front of five-hundred spectators. A non-first-class game, California were entitled to play eighteen players, with Bosanquet taking 11 of the wickets to fall as the hosts were dismissed for 125. Hawke's team made it to 155/8 thanks to half- centuries from Bosanquet and Warner, having been allowed to bat on beyond the winning total. =New Zealand= Hawke's team landed in New Zealand and played their opening first-class game against Auckland on 19 December. Hawke's team took an innings victory, with Fane scoring 82 in their first innings total of 321 all out. Auckland, with scores of 120 and 72 following on, fell to a heavy defeat. Five minor provincial matches followed: Taranaki, North Taranaki, Wanganui, Manawatu and Hawke's Bay all played the touring team and were all defeated, with Bosanquet scoring a century in the last of these matches. Wellington cricket team then played Hawke's XI on 15 January, posting 243 in their first innings that Hawke's team could only move 46 runs clear of before being dismissed. Wellington, however, fell to 140-all out thanks to 7/51 by George Thompson, with Warner and Cuthbert Burnup reaching the target of 95 without loss. The Wellington match drew 15,000 spectators, and takings of 650 pounds, a record for a cricket match in New Zealand at the time. Plum Warner, who captained Hawke's XI and scored a double-century on the tour. Four more minor provincial games followed: Wairarapa, Marlborough, Nelson and Westland. Then Hawke's team defeated Canterbury by 133 runs on 6 February, with half- centuries for Warner and Burnup, and then Otago by an innings and 230 runs on 13 February, with a five-wicket haul for Burnup and a double-century for Warner. There was controversy during the Canterbury match. Bosanquet was the fourth bowler used in by Hawke's team during the second innings and with his third ball, it looked as if he had bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the non-striker Arthur Sims, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle. The tourists' wicket keeper, Arthur Whatman, Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire, who decided Pearce was not out. Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said: \\"You're a nice cheat. I bowled him round his legs. Anybody could see that.\\" Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt, but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat. The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised. Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association, and Sims later told him to forget about it, but Sims' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games. After victory in a minor match against Southland, South Island were defeated by an innings on 21 February, with a century made by Tom Taylor. After defeating South Canterbury in a minor match on 25 February, Hawke's team played two games against New Zealand. New Zealand were dismissed for 164 in the first innings of the first of these two games, which began on 27 February. Thompson took 6/38. Fane then scored 124 runs of Hawke's 304 all out, and then Thompson (4/74) and Bosanquet (4/44) restricted New Zealand to 214, leaving Hawke's team 75 runs to get. They reached the target for the loss of only three wickets. The second match on 4 March saw a century from New Zealand's Daniel Reese, and another for Warner, before Burnup's 5/8 from 4.5 overs handed Hawke's team an innings victory. =Australia= Bosanquet's bowling action for the alt=A cricketer about to bowl. Hawke's victorious team landed in Australia later in March, and played the opening game of three matches on 13 March at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Hawke's XI had greater difficulty contending with the Australian Sheffield Shield teams, and were defeated by Victoria. They managed to draw their match against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 20 March with Albert Trott taking 6/88 and Reggie Duff scoring 194. Bosanquet also took 6/153 during the match, including the wicket of Victor Trumper, the leading Australian batsman and one of the best in the world at the time. He delivered two conventional leg breaks followed by a googly, later described by Bosanquet as the first bowled in Australia, which bowled Trumper.Green, p. 179. Many critics were impressed by the wicket-taking potential of googly bowling on hard pitches, and Warner later described Bosanquet's bowling as causing a sensation. On 27 March at the Unley Oval, South Australia defeated Hawke's XI by 97 runs despite centuries from Burnup and Taylor. In the second innings Henry Hay took 9/67 for the host team.

It led to the breakup of the producing partnership between David Puttnam and Sandy Lieberson.Trick or Treat at BFI Screenonline. Premise A lesbian couple who want a baby become involved with a married couple. Cast *Bianca Jagger *Nigel Davenport *Elsa Martinelli *Jan Smithers *Carlo Puri Production Ray Connolly first thought of the idea in 1969. He wrote it as a novel in 1974. He then turned it into a screenplay and succeeded in attracting the interested of David Puttnam of Goodtimes Enterprises. Connolly: > It was, in my mind, a love affair between four people, a sort of erotic > Chabrol piece about sexual relationships and emotional ambivalences. It was > to be set in Europe and to star three Europeans and one American. At a time > when English films were unattractive outside Britain, here seemed an > opportunity to make a film with international appeal. In fact I’d even gone > to Paris to write the novel in the first place. Finance was obtained from the National Film Finance Corporation, EMI Films, and an Italian company called Rizzoli Film. Later Playboy's film division contributed to the budget. Bianca Jagger and Stephanie Audran were cast in the leads; Audran later dropped out and was replaced by Elsa Martinelli. Production on the film commenced in 1975. Connolly says that Bianca Jagger was difficult to work with: > She wanted the script to be more faithful to the book, which was a > surprising request since the book was much more sexually explicit than any > of the scripts. During the next six months the question of the sex and > nudity was to be a point for endless discussions between Bianca and the rest > of us; we wanted to make a serious film about a sexual relationship between > two women and a man. To us that involved nudity. In Bianca's mind there was > some big bad film baron who wanted us to make a dirty film; that was absurd. > Neither the producers nor the financiers ever put any pressure upon us to > make a film other than the one we had always intended to make. Bianca never > said she wouldn’t do the nudity – and even signed a contract to say that she > would: she just moaned a lot about it. But then she moaned about most things > … the costumes, the way the film was lit, the importance of having a say in > approving the other girl and the eventual choices of the married couple... > But most of all she moaned about the script. Kathleen Tynan was called in to work on the script. Jagger refused to do nude scenes during filming in Rome. She claimed the movie was \\"pure pornography\\". Filming was eventually called off in January 1976. Connolly estimated around £400,000 had been spent leaving under forty minutes of usable footage. Impact The fate of the film contributed to the breakup of the partnership between David Puttnam and Sandy Lieberson.\\"Interview with Sandy Lieberson\\", 1970s Project 6 March 2008 accessed 26 May 2014 It also resulted in a number of lawsuits and was how Tynan met Puttnam and Apted; the three later made Agatha together.

The album was released by Ariola Japan on April 2, 2014, the same day as the 77th and final date of Misia's nationwide Hoshizora no Live VII: 15th Celebration concert tour, at the Bunkamura Orchard Hall, which was broadcast live on YouTube. The album yielded the singles \\"Shiawase o Forever\\" and \\"Boku wa Pegasus Kimi wa Polaris\\". The lead track \\"Hope & Dreams\\" was released as a promotional single for the album. Background and release New Morning is Misia's first studio album in close to three years, the first since Soul Quest (2011). It was written and recorded while Misia was on tour to commemorate her 15th anniversary. Misia was still recording songs two months prior to the album's release. She revealed to Oricon in an interview that Gorō Matsui had reached out to her after attending one of her concerts at Yokohama Arena in February 2014, saying he would write her a song. The next day he sent her the lyrics to \\"My Pride of Love\\". The gap between albums felt much shorter to Misia, who remarks that New Morning was mostly written in the previous year and created specifically to ring in the sixteenth year of her career. The concept for the new album revolved around going against the mainstream digital sound and focusing on the use of live, organic instruments. The title of the album is meant to represent renewal and new beginnings. On the way home from shooting the album artwork, which features Misia riding a horse as a nod to her love of equestrianism and 2014 being the Chinese year of the horse, Misia, executive producer Hiroto Tanigawa and art director Mitsuo Shindō were brainstorming on a title for the record when Shindō suggested New Morning, which they all loved and ultimately settled on. New Morning was released on April 2, 2014. The record was chosen for April release to coincide with the season of spring, which is synonymous with fresh starts. The album was released in two versions, one standard CD-only version and one limited CD/DVD version. The limited edition features two live recordings of \\"Deepness\\" and \\"Back in Love Again\\" as bonus tracks and comes with a DVD including lives performances from Misia's Hoshizora no Live VII 15th Celebration and Candle Night Fes concert tours and the music video to \\"Boku wa Pegasus Kimi wa Polaris\\". Critical reception CDJournal described the album as \\"at times emotional, at times comforting\\" and praised Misia's \\"natural and breathy\\" vocals for \\"welcoming broken hearts to a sunnier place\\". Bounce writer Taihei Kubota opined that New Morning is a \\"collection of diverse love songs\\", noting that Misia sings about simple things but does so over rich and tasteful medium-tempo and slow tracks. Kubota singles out the opening \\"Hope & Dreams\\" and closing \\"Re-Brain\\" as displays of variety. Commercial performance New Morning entered the daily Oricon Albums Chart at number 2, where it also peaked, with 10,000 copies sold in its first day. It debuted at number 7 on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart, with sales of 19,000 copies. The album also debuted number 7 on the Billboard Japan Top Albums Sales chart. New Morning charted for eleven consecutive weeks on the Oricon Albums Chart, selling a reported total of 33,000 copies during its run.

The site is about 167 km from Federal Capital Islamabad and from Punjab's Provincial Capital Lahore and is approachable directly from Islamabad and Lahore by a two-lane, all weather paved, partly mountainous road. The location of the Project is about 28 km upstream of Mangla Dam Reservoir. Gulpur Hydropower Project is a run-of-the-river project designed for the generation of consisting of two Kaplan-type turbine units with average energy output of 436 Gwh. Gulpur Hydropower Project is a part of least-cost energy generation plan, being executed by WAPDA to harness the indigenous hydropower resources of the country. WAPDA awarded the contract to MIRA Power Limited, a subsidiary of Korean company KOSEP, an independent power producer (IPP) being developed in private sector on BOOT basis (Build, Own, Operate and Transfer) under Government of Pakistan Policy for Power Generation Projects 2002 as adopted in Azad Jammu & Kashmir. The project has the capability of generating an average annual energy of 465 GWh. Background and construction Gulpur Hydropower Project is the third independent hydropower project in Pakistan. Korean company has also been awarded other contracts to build hydropower plants in the country on BOOT basis i.e. under construction 150 MW Patrind Hydropower Plant and 100MW Kotli Hydropower Project. The sponsor of the project is Korean South East Power Company along with Daelim Industrial Co., Ltd. and Lotte Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd.. The Construction of the Project has been awarded to a joint venture between Daelim and Lotte. Construction of Gulpur Hydropower Plant commenced in September 2014 and the project is expected to be completed in early 2020. The total cost of the project is about PKR 34 billion. Gulpur Hydropower Project is part of the least-cost energy generation plan of the Government of Pakistan. It is being executed on priority basis to harness indigenous hydropower resources to improve the ratio of hydel electricity in the national grid and help provide relief to the consumers. On its completion, Gulpur Hydropower project will generate about 465 Gwh of inexpensive electricity annually to earn revenue of about Rs 1 billion. Being an environment friendly hydropower project, it will help reduce dependence on expensive thermal power, thereby saving foreign exchange amounting to $36 million (equivalent to Rs 3 billion) to the country. According to estimation, Gulpur hydropower project will add about Rs 10 billion per annum to the national economy through socio-economic uplift in the country caused by the project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing the loan to Mira Power, run by three Korean companies, which will build and operate a 102MW hydropower plant.

Dedicated to the Virgin Mary, the original church on the site dated to about 1150 and was built by the Knights Templar before being largely rebuilt in about 1330 by the Knights Hospitaller. It is a Grade I listed building.\\"Church of Saint Mary, Baldock\\". British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 14 April 2014. History of St Mary's A view of Baldock in 1787 showing St Mary's church The advowson or patronage of the church of St. Mary at Baldock originally belonged to the Knights Templar, who built the original church in about 1150 on land given to them by Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Pembroke (parts of this early church are found at the east end of the chancel), and it continued in their possession until their suppression in 1308. It was then granted, together with the manor of Baldock, to the Knights Hospitaller, who expanded it in about 1330 and who in 1335 granted the advowson for ten years to John de Blomvill. The latter in 1343 granted it for two years to Sir Walter de Manny, after which it presumably reverted to the Hospitallers.Gray, H.J., The Church of St. Mary the Virgin Baldock, Herts - The British Publishing Company Limited, Gloucester (ND) pg 9 In 1359 it was claimed by the Crown as parcel of the Holy Trinity church of Weston. There seems no reason why Edward III should have claimed either church at that time, for both belonged to the Hospitallers; however, his claim seems to have been allowed, for the Crown presented to the church in 1383, and apparently continued to do so until after 1822. The patronage was transferred before 1829 to the Lord Chancellor. The latter held it until 1865, when it was transferred to the Bishop of Rochester, who presented until 1877, when it was acquired by the Bishop of St Albans. Since 1902 the presentation has been in the hands of the bishop and the Marquess of Salisbury alternately. The Fraternity or Gild of Jesus at St Mary's in Baldock was founded in 1459, and the charter confirmed in 1533. At that date it had a master, churchwardens, brethren and sisters, and found a priest who helped the parson of the church in his duties. At the inquiry of 1548 William Tybie was the brotherhood priest, and he assisted the parson of Baldock in serving his cure.

St Mary's church in 1852 Among the church's silverware is a silver and parcel-gilt chalice and paten dated to the reign of Elizabeth I (hallmarked 1569) known as the Byrd Chalice, named after the Reverend Josias Byrd (c.1578-1666), Rector of the church from 1613 to 1662. Byrd is remembered for giving Charles I a drink of wine from this chalice when he passed through Baldock, en route from Newmarket to London under the escort of Cornet George Joyce in June 1647.Gray, pg 29Lacey, Andrew The Cult of King Charles the Martyr The Boydell Press (2003) pg 42 Google Books The following inscription was on Byrd's gravestone which stood in the churchyard for 200 years, but which has subsequently disappeared: > 'Josiah Byrd lies buried here > Who taught this parish three-and-fifty year > Aged he was, as I have heard some say. > He was eighty eight before he passed away. > And died in the year > When one and sixes three made up the Quere.' For a time Byrd's assistant or lecturer was William Sherwin, who was either silenced or ejected. The church's plate also includes a cup and cover paten of 1629. The Rev. John Smith, Rector of the church from 1832 to 1870 and who is buried in the churchyard, was the first to decipher the complete text of the Diary of Samuel Pepys (others had previously deciphered sections of it). Smith laboured on the Diaries for three years, from 1819 to 1822. His transcription, which is kept in the Pepys Library, was the basis for the first published edition of the diary, edited by Lord Braybrooke, released in two volumes in 1825. The 19th century rectory beside the church, built in 1871 and known today as 'Butterfield House', was designed by the noted eccesiastical architect William Butterfield. Today it is a nursery, while a rather more modest modern rectory is located in Pond Lane. St Mary's has two church schools - St Mary's Infant and St Mary's Junior Schools, which share a common site on St Mary's Way in Baldock.Website of St Mary's Infant School, BaldockWebsite of St Mary's Junior School, Baldock The parasychologist Peter Underwood married in the church in 1944. Structure and fabric of the church St Mary's church in 1907 St Mary's church with spire in 1907 The nave looking towards the chancel c.1923 The same view in 2014 The church is built of flint rubble with stone dressings, while the tower is coated with Roman cement. Pieces of moulding and columns of an earlier building are used in the walls. The roofs of the north chapel and north aisle are of slate, and those of the rest of the church of lead. The church consists of a chancel, north and south chapels, nave, north and south aisles, west tower, and north and south porches. The whole of the church and the tower have embattled parapets, and the tower is surmounted by a leaden spire on an octagonal drum on top of which is a gold weathervane in the shape of a cockerel. The south chapel was begun in the last part of the 14th century and completed in the early 15th century. The south window is of three lights with restored tracery. Between it and the south-east corner is a piscina and sedilia of the 13th century. The flat head is probably 19th century. There are traces visible externally on the east and north walls of windows probably dating from the early part of the 13th century. The south aisle has three 15th-century windows in the south wall and one in the west wall, all of three lights with repaired tracery. The south doorway of the 14th century is to the west of the three windows, and to the west of it is a small 15th-century doorway, formerly leading to the staircase of the parvise. The oak door of this doorway is of the 15th century with a scutcheon for a ring. The south porch has two-light windows on the east and west containing restored Victorian stained glass windows. The north-west angle stair turret and the floor of the parvise have been removed, and the porch is now open to the roof. The north aisle has three 15th-century windows of three lights with restored tracery, and north door to the west of them dating to 1826, in the north wall. This door opens to the north porch, which was substantially repaired and altered in 1826.Gray, pg 19 The west window of three lights has for the most part modern stonework, but a few old stones remain. The statue of the Virgin Mary with Child on the north wall was given to the church in memory of the Very Rev. Albert Victor Baillie, Dean of Windsor, who died in Baldock in 1955. The statue, by Sir William Reid Dick, had been presented to Baillie on his retirement from Windsor.Gray, pg 25 The clerestory was made in the 15th century, and the parvise was added at the same time, when the church was re-roofed. The 19th century saw major improvement to some of the roofing and windows, the rebuilding of the spire in 1816 and the North Porch in 1826. Also in the 19th century the whole building was repaired, and the north aisle and north chapel were re-roofed. The belfry stage of the tower was restored in the early 20th century. A small 19th century porch on the northwest replaces the former rood-loft staircase, but the upper doorway, which is blocked, and part of the lower doorway remain, the latter in the aisle, just outside the screen. At the north-east corner of the chapel is an elaborately carved niche of the 14th century, which must have been moved to its present position in the 15th century, when the wide east window was inserted and the north wall was recessed. On the south side is a 14th-century piscina. No bowl is visible, and a slab was inserted at the back in the 19th century. The communion table in this chapel is of the 17th century. The nave has six bays of the 14th century and which are slightly different from the two bays of the chancel, the two easternmost being rather lower than the rest. In the north wall is another rood loft door, now blocked. The 15th-century clerestory, which runs continuously above the arcades in both nave and chancel, has seven windows on each side. The roof, also of the 15th century, is precisely like that of the chancel and rests on corbels carved with heads. The west tower stands at 130 feet to the top of the spire, the lower part of the walls probably dating back to the time of the earliest known church, - circa 1150, but the fine lower arch is 14th century. The west window of three lights is also of the 14th century, with a two-centred rear arch, but the tracery has been much restored in cement, as have the belfry windows also. Outside the church in the wall of the north aisle is a 14th-century recess with an ogee arch, of which the jambs are restored. Set in the recess is a 14th-century coffin lid with a cross in relief. Also outside in the wall of the south aisle are two recesses, probably of the 15th century, of which the stonework has been renewed. The lych gate was built in 1871 at the same time as the new rectory, which was designed by noted architect William Butterfield. The chancel The east end of the chancel is from the original church on this site and is late 12th century, but the remainder of the chancel, the north chapel (now the vestry), the nave, north and south aisles, west tower, and probably the lower part of the south porch were built about 1330. The eastern and earlier portion of the chancel has an east window of five lights; under this window on the outside is a 14th-century niche with a trefoiled head, having a rebated edge, and the remains of iron hinges The late 14th century chancel screen (or rood screen), which is in the same line with those of the chapels, is a fine one in carved oak of three bays, and two half bays at the north and south ends. The screen in the north aisle is 15th century with four narrow bays on either side, while that in the south aisle dates to about 1480, with three bays on either side of the doorway.Gray, pgs 21-22 The 15th-century roof of the chancel has moulded wall plates and ties, trusses, with tracery in the spandrels. The wall plates rest on corbels with carved heads. The Norman and Beard organ was installed in 1913 and was restored in the 1990s. Font font is late 12th-century and dates to the earliest church on the site The font is transitional Norman of the late 12th century, belonging to the earliest known church. It has an octagonal bowl with beaded edges and a circular stem flanked by octagonal shafts with moulded bases.Gray, pg 23 The steps and paving on which it stands are very much later - circa 1901. Beside the font is a strong mediaeval iron-bound chest known as a 'Peter's Pence' chest. Brasses and other memorials At the top of the nave in front of the chancel screen is laid a stone slab in memory of Reginald de Argentein (died 1307), believed to be a Knight Templar and who was responsible for rebuilding the church.Fowler, Rev. H., Transactions of the St Albans & Herts Architectural and Archaeological Society (1885) Outside the vestry (originally the north chapel) is a Purbeck marble coffin lid of the 13th century, with a cross in relief. On the north wall above this is a brass of a man and his wife, of about 1400; the man is dressed as a forester, and the lower part of his figure, and the dog at his feet, together with the inscription, are missing. On the floor is the brass of a man and his wife, of about 1470. On the north wall are two, one with shrouded figures of a man and his wife, of c.1520, the other an inscription to Margaret Benet, dated 1587. In the floor at the west end of the nave is a brass with a three-quarter length figure of a nun of about 1400. The inscription plate is gone and in its place is an inscription to a rector of Baldock from 1807. On the floor is also a slab with an indent for a floreated cross. Near the doorway of the north aisle is a slab with an inscription in Gothic capitals, of the 14th century. In the south aisle are the indents of a man and his two wives, of the 15th century. In the churchyard are the graves of Rev. John Smith, a Rector at Baldock and the first person to completely decipher the Diary of Samuel Pepys beside that of his son Josiah William Smith, an English barrister, legal writer and judge. 'Coathanger Window' and other glass The Coathanger Window The chancel has a modern east window of five lights, containing fragments of coloured glass at the top, probably of early 15th-century date. The two windows, each of three lights, in the north wall, are of the 15th century, with repaired tracery. The present stained glass is 19th century and shows little artistic merit. The stained glass at the eastern end dates to 1849 and depicts Jesus Christ in the centre, with the Four Evangelists - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. In the north aisle is a window by Charles Eamer Kempe dating from 1881. The three windows in clear glass in the north aisle replaced Victorian stained-glass windows which were of poor quality. These windows are unique as they were re-glazed with the proceeds from the sale of covered coat hangers made and sold by Mrs Dorothy Arbury in the 1960s; this act is commemorated by the miniature coat hangers round a cross in the 'Coathanger Window' in the north aisle beside the vestry and dedicated to the memory of Mrs Arbury. The original 1960s window with its design scratched onto the glass was destroyed by vandals in the late 1990s and was replaced with a new window with the image acid-etched into the glass and designed by the then Churchwarden Glenn Christodoulou.Parish Records of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock Bells and clock The church has a peal of eight bells: (1), (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7) by Taylor of Loughborough in 1882; (5), with inscription 'Miles Graye made me, 1650'; and (8) 'Laudo Deum verum plebem voco, convococlerum defunctos ploro nuptus colo festa docoro. Wm. Goodwyn Jam. Manison ch[urch] wards 1711. The working parts of the present church clock were made by Messrs. Potts & Sons, of Leeds. It was set in motion on 25 November 1882 and weighs two tons. The Parish records state that the initial cost of the clock was £250. However, there had been a clock in the tower before 1882. There are references in the Churchwarden accounts dated 1711 and again in 1819, where The Vestry Meeting authorised the sum of £55 for repairs to the clock and chimes. The Westminster Chimes ring out the quarter-hour on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 7th bells, the hours being struck on the tenor bell. In the Ringing Chamber there is a peal board dating to 1737 and which is said to be one of the earliest in the country. Parish registers The original registers are in six books: (i) all entries from 1558 to 1709; (ii) baptisms and burials from 1710 to 1792 and marriages from 1710 to 1753;(iii) baptisms and burials from 1793 to 1812; (iv)(v) and (vi) marriages from 1754 to 1788, 1788 to 1804, and 1804 to 1812, respectively. These are now at the Hertfordshire Archives and Local Studies. Notable burials * Rev.

The novella was published in 1971.  Presentation  The book tells the impossible friendship between the narrator Hans Schwarz, son of a Jewish doctor, and Konradin von Hohenfels, a young aristocrat, during the rise of the Nazi regime (in 1932) in Stuttgart. Hans and Konradin manage to become friends despite their differences. Hans invites his friend several times to his house and is surprised that Konradin does not do the same. Finally, Konradin invites Hans to his home, but each time without the presence of his parents. Hans, annoyed, asks for an explanation. That's when Konradin tells Hans that his mother hates Jews. Hitler's rise to power causes Konradin to abandon Hans. Hans' parents, who suspect the harassment suffered by their son in high school, decide to send him to the United States to live with his grandparents, where he studies law at Harvard University in Massachusetts and becomes a lawyer. His parents commit suicide as a result of Nazi persecution. He tries to forget the hell of his past. Long after his studies, Hans receives a letter from Germany from Karl Alexander Gymnasium, his former high school, accompanied by a booklet containing a list with all the names of former students who died in the war. He recognizes the names of former students in his class but he does not want to look at the letter H for fear of finding the name of his friend Konradin. Just before throwing the booklet away, he decides to look at the H and discovers the name of his friend, and that is when one understands the true meaning of friendship found. Indeed, his friend Konradin was executed by the Nazis after his participation in the assassination attempt against Hitler on 20 July 1944.

The record and the attention it threw on various YouTube clips of the dancers in action led to a succession of performances at Sonar Festival, Berghain and elsewhere across Europe, Australia and Africa. =List of Shangaan Electro releases= * \\"Ndhuma\\" by Mualusie (2015, SHANGAANBANG) * \\"Malamulele/Khombo/Tshamiseka\\" by Mualusie (2015, SHANGAANBANG) * \\"Volume 2\\" by Da Multi Snake (2015, SHANGAANBANG) * \\"N\\" by Da Multi Snake (2014, SHANGAANBANG) * \\"Volume 1\\" by Da Multi Snake (2014, SHANGAANBANG) * \\"Heke Heke / Hoza\\" by Xitsonga Dance (2013, Jialong) * \\"Bafana Bafana / Dyambu\\" by Tshetsha Boys (2013, Jialong) * \\"Shangaan Shake\\" (2012, Honest Jon's) * Tshe-Tsha (2008, Nozinja Music) * \\"Ndzi Teke Riendzo\\" by Foster Manganyi (2008, Honest Jon's) * Shangaan Electro - New Wave Dance Music From South Africa (2010, Honest Jon's) * Pollyn - \\"How Small We Are (Nozinja's Shangaan Electro Remix)\\" from How Small We Are EP (2011) * Pollyn - \\"How Small We Are (Nozinja's Shangaan Electro Version)\\" from Pieces in Patterns EP (2012) * Nacho Patrol - \\"Lineas Angola (Nozinja's Shangaan Electro 'Sansana' Remix)\\" from Lineas Angola (2013) * Nkata Mawewe - Khulumani * Xitsonga Dance - Vomaseve Vol. 6 * Lucy Shivambo - Wamina hi Wihi * Tshe-Tsha Boys - Xolo / Ka Buti * Tshe-Tsha Boys - Tshe-Tsha * Tiyiselani Vomaseve - Vanghana * Ni Vhona Khombo - Mancingelani Vol. 2 * Vuyelwa - Mosimana Wa Dikgom * Mapostoli - Mapostoli * Mario Chauke - Avanga Hembi Vol. 3 * Tshe-Tsha Boys - ni famba na wena * MC Mabasa Na Shigombe Sisters (No. 17) - Ritaboxeka Thumba =Expansion of the scene= Shangaan Electro has found a particular kinship with other forward thinking electronic producers and DJs, including Caribou, The Knife, Mount Kimbie and Pearson Sound. A series of 12”s took these links with other electronic music styles further with Theo Parrish, Rashad & Spinn, Ricardo Villalobos, Hype Williams and others remixing Shangaan tracks. Then in 2013, two brand new Nozinja cuts (under various pseudonyms) followed on Dan Snaith's (Caribou, Daphni) Jiaolong label. In 2014, SHANGAANBANG, a UK-based label specializing in Shangaan Electro put out their first release 'Volume 1' from Limpopo-based artist Da Multi Snake. Characteristics The Guardian describes the music as a \\"harder, faster, electronicised\\" version of a traditional Tsonga music, itself characterised by fluid guitar lines and drumming popularised by artists such as Thomas Chauke and one-time Paul Simon collaborator General MD Shirinda, who appeared on 1986's Graceland. Created primarily for dance, Nozinja's productions have pushed the speed of the music up to 190bpm, and with less focus on bass than other dance music styles, Shangaan electro has a \\"rapid-fire kineticism\\" that is stylistically linked to Footwork. The Dance Shangaan, the name given to the people of Gaza Empire are now part of The Tsonga people, a diverse population that includes the Shangaans, Thonga, Tonga and several smaller ethnic groups which influence the Shangaan Electro dance such are the footwork dance ceremonies, Xibelani dance or the Pantsula dance, a more urban street culture emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. The performers are often wearing costumes and masks resembling fertility rituals where they use it to better interact with the public leading most of times to a great group communion on stage.RhythmTravels.com Footnotes References Category:African electronic dance music ","title":"Shangaan electro"},{"id":"42379312","text":"Youssef Fadel (born 1949) is a Moroccan novelist and playwright.

Biography  Gehrmann studied economics and social sciences from 1960 till 1966 at the Universities of Saarbruecken, Vienna and Muenster. After completing his PhD in 1969 at the University of Munster, Gehrmann began his work as a scientific fellow at the Universities of Muenster and Augsburg and was there until 1973. He then began his career as a visiting researcher at United Nations in Geneva (Economic Commission for Europe) for the subject “ Measurement of regional disparities in urban and regional policy, documented by economic, social and environmental indicators” from 1974 till 1976. From 1976 till 1980, Gehrmann was a full-time desk-officer manager, both in Federal Statistical Office and in State Government of Hesse. In 1980, he was offered and accepted a chair at the Federal University of Applied Administrative Sciences (Bruehl/ Bonn). During this time, he undertook several time-limited delegations to Federal Ministries in Bonn for highly specialised issues in economic, social and environmental fields. After Germany’s reunification, Gehrmann accepted a chair at the Bauhaus University in Weimar from 1990 till 1996. At the same time, he was a consultant to Germany’s “Privatisation Agency” (Treuhandanstalt). From 1996 to 1998, he worked on a 2-years-stay in a task-force in the Federal Ministries of “Interior” and “Labour” for a special function in long-term economic affairs. Since 2004, Gehrmann has been working at the Steinbeis University Berlin. He is active as the director of the institutes “Global Consulting and Government” and “Renewable Energy, Technology and Management”.

Beyond the University arena, Gehrmann is the managing director of IKAT Ltd (International Knowledge and Technology Ltd.) which he founded in 2012. The company is focused on consultations in International Knowledge and Technology Transfer.  Major research and consulting fields  After receiving his PhD, Gehrmann began researching empirical survey and measurement of business cycles indicators and business surveys. After, from 1973 till 1994, his research focused on “Social indicators, social reporting and environmental indicators”. Additionally, “Urban and regional research in emerging markets” was also an area of research. Since 1989, the issues “Economic consulting and technology transfer in emerging markets” became his most important research focus. Because of the rapid development in information and communication technologies from 1993 till 2003, the new subjects “e-learning, e-Government and e-business” received first priority in his research. Since 2003, Gehrmann has been a member in “Steinbeis-Conglomerate”, which consists of (1) Steinbeis Foundation, (2) Steinbeis Technology Transfer Ltd. and (3) Steinbeis University Berlin. At the University, Gehrmann is the managing director of the Steinbeis institutes' “Global Consulting and Government” and “Renewable Energy, Technology and Management” with branches and contact person in Cairo, Tripoli, Tehran, Moscow, Astana, Shanghai and Singapore. Because of the manifold executed consultations referring “concepts in job-related qualification” – with special reference to emerging markets – the new topic “Tools for interactive multimedia-based teaching and learning methods in digital age” became more and more important. The current major research area is, since 2012, the analysis and evaluation of “Technology-Leap-Frogging” with special reference to the issue “Consequences and effects of High-Tech-Implementation in emerging countries”. Since 1972, Gehrmann has undertaken manifold research and lecturing trips to the USA, Canada, Soviet Union/ Russia, Egypt, Libya, Iran, Oman, Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, Kazakhstan as well as many European countries.

Built in 1871, it is a particularly fine example of late Italianate architecture, built for the manager of local woolen mills. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, and included in the Enfield Village Historic District in 2010.Laprey, Kari Ann; Monroe, Lynne Emerson. National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Enfield Village Historic District. National Park Service. September 2009. (Available by request from the National Park Service.) Description The Hewitt House is located in the village of Enfield, at the northeast corner of U.S. Route 4 and Maple Street. It is a 2½-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys, and clapboarded exterior. The house is three bays wide and two deep, with paired brackets in the eaves. The front facade is symmetrical about the main entrance, with paired windows in each bay on the second floor, and projecting polygonal bay windows on the ground floor. The bay window roofs and the front entry portico are covered by shallow-pitch roofs with brackets matching those in the main roof line. The house was built in 1871 by John W. Dodge, a native of nearby Lebanon. The corner it stands on was known at the time as Dodge's Corner. Dodge came to Enfield to manage the locally important Shaker-owned woolen mills, a role he served until 1885, when the Shakers relocated their operation to Bristol. He also served one term in the New Hampshire Senate. The house remained in the hands of Dodge's descendants for over a century (the last being Robert Hewitt). The Hewitts were also locally prominent, as owners of a press which published local newspapers and magazines. Architecture The Italianate house is an elegant reflection of Enfield's period of great prosperity in the years after the American Civil War, and an unusually well-crafted example of vernacular Italianate architecture.

It is located at 866 US Route 3, at its junction with New Hampshire Route 113. The architecturally eclectic building it presently occupies was built in 1909 to a design by Boston architects Fox & Gale, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It was the first purpose- built building for the library, which had occupied private homes and other facilities since its founding in 1893. Architecture and history The Holderness Free Library is located prominently in the village center of Holderness, at the northeast corner of US 3 and New Hampshire 113, on a lot overlooking the Squam River. It is a small single-story masonry building, with a brick exterior on a stone foundation. It is covered by a hip roof with slightly flared eaves, under which are elaborately decorated rafter ends. The brickwork is mostly common bond, with corner quoining and bands of corbelling above the window bays. The entrance is at the center of the symmetrical south- facing front facade, sheltered by a wood-frame vestibule whose entrance has a Classical surround of fluted pilasters and a segmented-arch pediment. The interior is a single large chamber, finished in a variety of woodwork. The library has its beginnings in a private collection established by summer residents in 1878, which was loaned to the public from a private residence. In 1893, the town officially adopted this collection, which was placed in Whitten's General Store. The store (and several other buildings in the village center) were destroyed by fire in 1906, reducing most of the original collection to ashes. Private funds, raised mainly from wealthy summer residents, paid for the construction of this building, which was completed in 1909 to a design by the Boston firm of Fox & Gale. The building is one of the architecturally most eclectic in the New Hampshire Lakes Region, exhibiting a harmonious combination of Classical, Colonial Revival, and Victorian elements.

NGFWs perform deeper inspection compared to stateful inspection performed by the first- and second-generation firewalls.Next- generation firewalls: Security without compromising performance - By Patrick Sweeney, 17 October 2012 NGFWs use a more thorough inspection style, checking packet payloads and matching signatures for harmful activities such as exploitable attacks and malware.Next-Generation Firewalls 101 - By Frank J. Ohlhorst, 1 March 2013  Evolution of next-generation firewalls  Improved detection of encrypted applications and intrusion prevention service. Modern threats like web-based malware attacks, targeted attacks, application-layer attacks, and more have had a significantly negative effect on the threat landscape. In fact, more than 80% of all new malware and intrusion attempts are exploiting weaknesses in applications, as opposed to weaknesses in networking components and services. Stateful firewalls with simple packet filtering capabilities were efficient blocking unwanted applications as most applications met the port-protocol expectations. Administrators could promptly prevent an unsafe application from being accessed by users by blocking the associated ports and protocols. But blocking a web application that uses port 80 by closing the port would also mean complications with the entire HTTP protocol. Protection based on ports, protocols, IP addresses is no more reliable and viable. This has led to the development of identity-based security approach, which takes organizations a step ahead of conventional security appliances which bind security to IP-addresses. NGFWs offer administrators a deeper awareness of and control over individual applications, along with deeper inspection capabilities by the firewall. Administrators can create very granular \\"allow/deny\\" rules for controlling use of websites and applications in the network.

Built in 1895-96, it is the only such building standing in the Squam Lake area, from a period when there were a significant number of resort hotels around the lake. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is now owned by the Squam Lakes Natural Science Center, and is open seasonally as an art gallery and craft showroom. Description and history The former Holderness Inn is located on the western fringe of the village center, on the north side of US 3. It is a 3-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled mansard roof and clapboarded exterior. A three-story wing extends northeast from the main block, and is similarly roofed. The north side of the wing has had a two-story shed-roof addition added. The main block has a porch that wraps around three sides. The interior was historically arranged with public spaces (lounge and meeting areas, reception, kitchen, and dining area) on the ground floor, and guest rooms on the upper floors. It retains many original finishes, including plaster and woodwork, despite some modifications for its use by the science center. The inn was built in 1895-6 by John Davison, whose previous hotel building, a converted parsonage, was destroyed by fire. His business's importance to the local economy was underscored by the town's decision to exempt the property from taxation for ten years if he rebuilt, and it set a reward for the capture of the arsonist who is thought to have set the fire. Originally called the \\"Central Inn\\", it was soon renamed the Holderness Inn. It was operated by the Davison family until 1967, when it was turned over to the science center.

In the past, a YND was defined as a young person (18 and under) loitering outside buildings at night. However, owing to the fact that the number of YNDs was considered insufficient to be served by large scale YND services, people who are over 18 years old are now classified as YNDs so as to be served by YND services. The Boys' and Girls' Clubs Association of Hong Kong also defines the age range of YNDs as being between the ages of six and thirty. There are three terms to describe particular types of YNDs: one-night stand drifters (who engage in nighttime loitering less than once a week), occasional night drifters (who engage in nighttime loitering more than once a week), and persistent night drifters (who engage in nighttime loitering more than three times a week). YNDs as a phenomenon The term YND first originated within Hong Kong academia in the 1990s to describe the alarming trend of youth on the margins of society. A large number of young people tend to loiter at parks at night or even all night long. Most of the night drifters run away from their families and prefer to be with their friends. As the YNDs usually wander in parks or streets at night, they become involved with triad. Many of them drop out of school and spend their time vandalising, chasing around, petting publicly, harassing public transport passengers and participating in the use of recreational drugs. Those behaviours happen frequently and thus create much public concern. Studies show that the number of YNDs has been increasing starting from 2008. These studies reveal that the YNDs tend to commit high-risk crimes as well. More and more news reports are surfacing concerning the misbehavior of YNDs in 2013. Those issues reflect the loosening control and supervision of families and schools. Social background The social background of the YNDs in Hong Kong is quite different from similar delinquent youth in other countries. Rather than suffering a bad family background, many of the YNDs come from non- violent, non-divorced families. However, many of them claim that their parents are apathetic. There is a lack of communication and caring in their families. Unlike the findings in previous studies, new research has shown that YNDs are not socially isolated, but instead tend to have close friends who belong to the same night drifting group. Many YNDs described their friends as caring and supportive, which suggests that lack of caring in the family may contribute to the night drifting behaviour. Regarding their education level, most YNDs are recently finished with junior secondary schooling. Most of them have dropped out of school, but a small minority are still attending school. Some YNDs have previously admitted that their academic performance is poor and that their relationships with teachers have been strained. As for those who are not receiving education, some are unemployed and some are working as unskilled workers. It is common for them to change jobs within a short period of time.  Motivations for becoming a YND  The main causes of teenagers becoming YNDs can be divided into peer influence and family system. With peer influence-related reasons, company with other YND friends and seeking entertainment are major causes of them being YNDs. In family-related reasons, the parents of the YNDs are seldom home at night, or some of the drifters suffer from domestic violence. Thus, the YNDs stay in street during night to avoid feeling lonely or bored at home and avoiding conflicts and punishments. Places to stay As public places generally do not need permission to enter, YNDs generally congregate at these establishments. Also, there is a lack of supervision by guards and/or adults. Therefore, 24-hour convenience stores and fast food shops are popular places for YNDs, such as the 7–11 convenience store chain or McDonald's. Because they provide YNDs food, drink, lighting, and seating, many YNDs prefer to stay at public places throughout the night. Besides convenience stores and the like, leisure playgrounds or football courts are popular sites for YNDs to stay at. Unlike stores and shops, there are no staffs and workers at playgrounds to interrupt or disturb them. It is completely free for them to do whatever they want, for the most part. Some of them may bring food and drinks or drugs to the places mentioned. On the top of this, YNDs themselves may provide apartments or houses to friends, as they think these places provide them a sense of security and comfort. Problems posed by YNDs YNDs are the target group of triad cultures. The drifters are exposed to different related problems. Substance abusing, engaging in sex activities or work, thieving, bullying, creating public nuisances and bear risk in personal security are the common problems that drifters facing. Besides, the crime rate of YNDs drifters is higher than that of general teenagers. Services provided to YNDs in Hong Kong The government has extended the service hours and service focus of 18 Integrated Children and Youth Services Centers in 18 districts to provide overnight outreaching service and satisfy the needs of YNDs from September 2001 onwards.

NT Draught are the makers of the Darwin Stubby. A Darwin Stubby refers to several large beer bottle sizes in Australia. It was first introduced in April 1958 with an 80-imperial-fluid-ounce (2,270 ml; 76.9 U.S. fl oz) capacity. The 2.25-litre (76.1 U.S. fl oz; 79.2 imp fl oz) Darwin Stubby has an iconic, if kitsch status in Australian folklore. In May 2015 Carlton & United Breweries announced that they will no longer brew NT Draught on a regular basis. History Darwin's first brewery, designated \\"Darwin Brewery\\", was founded in 1951 by Harry Ellis-Kells in the Berrimah industrial area, 3 miles from Darwin's GPO, and before long was producing four kinds of beer: Buffalo Bitter, Palmerston Dinner Ale, Darwin Ale and Darwin Lager. Ellis-Kells \\"skipped town\\" in August that year after being successfully sued by contractor E. Favaro for £359. In 1952 the property was sold to brothers Bernard and John Lyall Allen, who floated a company to purchase the site from them and to erect additional buildings, procure equipment and hire staff to re-commence brewing at the site, but due to insufficient interest, the venture was called off. It is likely but not certain that the brewery established by C.U.B. was on this site. In 1956 Carlton & United Breweries established their Darwin brewery, N.T. Brewery Pty. Ltd., in the suburb of Berrimah. The first beer, Carlton Draught, was brewed on 13 October of that year. The brewery, however, did not have an associated bottling plant, so bottled beer still had to be shipped from Melbourne. Due to the logistics of shipping bottles such a long distance, the company decided in April 1958 to introduce a bigger bottle, a bottle, which became known as the \\"Darwin Stubby\\". Darwin stubby c. 1981 with interim paper label following merger At that time most hotels in the Darwin area were owned by the Swan Brewing Company of Western Australia, which preferred to sell its own beer from these outlets, so the \\"Darwin Stubby\\" was only available from one or two independent hotels and licensed stores, mostly grocers and supermarkets. In 1981 Swan Brewery and CUB formed a merged entity Northern Territory Breweries Pty Ltd. In 1981 CUB bought out Swan's interest leaving it in sole control of the Northern Territory beer market. The Darwin brewery closed in 1989 however NT Draught continued to be brewed from the company's Melbourne brewery. In October 1996 CUB acquired the 200,000 hl Darwin Brewery in Winnellie from Goldchill Brewing, and commenced production of Victoria Bitter and Carlton Light for the Northern Territory in November. The brewery also produced NT Draught in the Darwin Stubby. In May 2015 Carlton & United Breweries announced that due to decreasing volumes and increasing costs that it would be ceasing production of NT Draught. The company did advise that it would become one of their heritage beers and they would investigate bringing it out in special runs.

There are many variations in the different descriptions of the nine sons, including in basic facts like their names, but all versions state that there are nine.  History  The oldest known attestation of the children of the dragon list is found in the Shuyuan zaji (, Miscellaneous records from the bean garden) by Lu Rong (1436–1494); however, he noted that the list enumerates mere synonyms of various antiques, not children of a dragon., quoting Several Ming Dynasty texts list what were claimed as the Nine Offspring of the Dragon (), and subsequently these feature prominently in popular Chinese stories and writings. , quoting Xie Zhaozhe (, 1567–1624) in his work Wu Za Zu (, ca. 1592) gives the following listing in order of oldest to youngest: > A well-known work of the end of the sixteenth century, the Wuzazu , informs > us about the nine different young of the dragon, whose shapes are used as > ornaments according to their nature. *The qiú niú , (Form of dragon) a > creature that likes music, are used to adorn musical instruments. *The yá zì > , (Hybrid of wolf and dragon) a creature that likes to fight, is aggressive > and is normally found on cross-guards on sword as ornaments. *The cháo fēng > , (Resemble a Phoenix and dragon) a creature that likes to adventure.

These > examples can be found architecture throughout Asia used for adorning key- > holes, on roofing, incense burners, door knockers, bridges, etc. The Sheng'an waiji () collection by the poet Yang Shen (, 1488–1559) gives different 5th and 9th names for the dragon's nine children: the tāo tiè (), form of beasts, which loves to eat and is found on food-related wares, and the jiāo tú (), which looks like a conch or clam, does not like to be disturbed, and is used on the front door or the doorstep. Yang's list is bì xì, chī wěn or cháo fēng, pú láo, bì àn, tāo tiè, qiú niú, yá zì, suān ní, and jiāo tú. In addition, there are some sayings including xì xì (); which have the shape of the chī hǔ ( One kind small form dragon), and are fond of literature, are represented on the sides of grave-monuments.

For example, a Chinese dragon is normally described in terms of nine attributes and usually has 117 (9x13) scales - 81 (9x9) Yang and 36 (9x4) Yin. This is also why there are nine forms of the dragon and there are 9 sons of the dragon. The Nine-Dragon Wall is a spirit wall with images of nine different dragons, and is found in imperial Chinese palaces and gardens. Because nine was considered the number of the emperor, only the most senior officials were allowed to wear nine dragons on their robes — and then only with the robe completely covered with surcoats. Lower-ranking officials had eight or five dragons on their robes, again covered with surcoats; even the emperor himself wore his dragon robe with one of its nine dragons hidden from view. There are many places in China with the phrase \\"Nine Dragons\\" in their name, the most famous being Kowloon (in Cantonese) in Hong Kong. The part of the Mekong in Vietnam is known as Cửu Long, with the same meaning.

It is being administered by the Congregation of the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena, a congregation affiliated with the Dominican Order of the Roman Catholic Church. History The college traces its history to the establishment of the congregation Beaterio de Santa Catalina de Manila, a convent, on July 26, 1696 in Intramuros in the Spanish Philippines. It was a religious congregation for Spanish religious women, under the leadership of Mother Francisca del Espiritu Santo, who served as the first prioress of the congregation in the country and Rev. Fr. Juan de Sto. Domingo, who served as the congregation's adviser. The congregation soon began accepting indigenous girls as well, in contrast to the other religious congregations at the time which only accepted Spanish women. At the same time, it was also beginning to be involved in the ministry of educating young women. Thus in 1706, the congregation established the Colegio de Santa Catalina, transforming the beaterio into a convent and a center of learning for women, both Spanish and Filipina women. Santa Catalina was the first educational institution run by religious women; it taught women the principles of Catholic faith and Christian living, as well as training on creative and domestic arts. The school was eventually placed under a royal patronage on February 17, 1716. In 1863, the school was authorized to offer teacher training courses. In 1889, it was granted the privilege to confer the academic degree of Maestra Normal by royal decree. Despite damage due to the earthquakes of 1863 and 1880, the school's buildings were rebuilt in 1883; one of them underwent expansion in 1894. In addition, a 3-storey school building was constructed in 1939 under the supervision of the architecture firm of Pedro Siochi and Company. The school campus was destroyed in 1941 by Japanese bombs; the tertiaries were forced to move the school to Legarda St. and the tertiaries’ convent to Sampaloc. Colegio de Santa Catalina was not rebuilt in its old Intramuros site after the war and Colegio de San Juan de Letran later acquired the property for the expansion of its campus. The congregation proceeded to reopen Santa Catalina College in its new home along Legarda St. after the war with the construction of its present school building in 1951. The college started the offering a secretarial course in 1953, Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BSEEd) and Bachelor of Science in Commerce (BSC) in 1965. With the rapid increase of colleges and universities in the area, the college enrollment started to decline while the grade school and high school departments continued to progress. During the school year 1979-1980, the college department was temporarily phased out and was re-opened in 1985 with the new course offerings: Academic Programs * Elementary (Grade 1-6) * Pay High School (Grade 7-10) * College (Bachelor of Elementary Education major in Religious Education)  References  Category:Education in San Miguel, Manila Category:Catholic universities and colleges in Manila Category:Catholic elementary schools in Manila Category:Catholic secondary schools in Manila Category:1600 establishments in Asia ","title":"Santa Catalina College"},{"id":"42379913","text":"Thomas William Kelly (known throughout his playing career as Bill or Billy (22 November 1919 – 1970)) was an English footballer who made 157 appearances in the Football League for Darlington either side of the Second World War.

The Swann's Point area, located west of the mouth of Gray Creek, has a rich historic of precolonial Native American occupation, as well as significant early colonial settlements. It was first granted to Richard Pace, whose warning famously saved the Jamestown Colony during the Indian Massacre of 1622. The Paces abandoned their settlement in 1624. In 1628, the tip of Swann's Point was a site at which the colonists of Jamestown traded with the local natives. The Swann family association with the area began in 1635, when William Swann acquired a land patent for 1200 acres at Swann's Point. The plantation increased to 1650 acres by patents to Col. Thomas Swann in 1638 and 1655 After Bacon's Rebellion (1676) the King's Commissioners sent to Virginia in investigate the \\"troubles\\" held their proceedings at Swann's Point. It was here, then, that petitions were heard complaining of the conduct of William Hartwell, captain of Governor Berkeley's guard, in the suppression of the rebellion. Swann's Point was sold by the son of Col. Thomas Swann in 1706 to John Joseph Jackman, the plantation was purchased in turn from Jackman in 1709 by Major George Marable who three months later sold the plantation to his brother-in-law, John Hartwell. Upon his death in 1714, Swann's Point passed to John Hartwell's daughter, Elizabeth, then a minor. When she later married Richard Cocke of Henrico County they made their residence at Swann's Point. It remained in the Cocke family for several generations and was the birthplace of General John Hartwell Cocke who later became associated with Bremo in Fluvanna County. In the mid-1900s, the plantation was purchased by state Sen. Garland Gray, who used it as a summer home until the manor house was destroyed by fire. Later, Gray, who was one of the wealthiest men in Virginia and owned tens of thousands of acres of land bet the Swann's Point property on game of cards and lost. True to his word he transferred the property to the winner. The site which contains 17th century graves was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. A portion of the Swann's Point area was donated by the owners to the National Park Service in 1974 to forestall the construction of a bridge across the James River to the area.

Life and career Greaves was born at Springwell Colliery, County Durham. He began his football career with Hylton Colliery before joining Football League First Division club Bury. He made a successful first appearance at right back as one of four debutants in a goalless draw with Preston North End on 16 September 1911, described in the Manchester Guardian report as \\"always effective\\". He kept his place: in October, in a one-goal defeat to Manchester United, he was, again according to the Guardian, \\"easily the best of a moderate pair of backs\\". Bury were relegated to the Second Division at the end of Greaves's first season. As a Second Division team, they lost to Southern League club Crystal Palace 2–0 in the 1912–13 FA Cup. The Daily Mirror wrote that \\"a feature of the match was the splendid combination of the Palace halves and forwards, who, but for the great play of Greaves at back for Bury, would probably have run up a much bigger score.\\" Even he could not cope with Palace's Davis for the first goal; another player \\"made an abortive attempt to stop him, and then Greaves hung on like a leech. Greaves, who is head and shoulders taller than Davis, made every effort to check the young forward, getting both in front and behind him; and even roughing-it with his slim opponent. But Davis beat him\\". His physical style of play was noted in September 1913, in a match against Fulham. The Daily Express correspondent thought \\"Greaves would do well to relinquish some of his methods of tackling. They savour more of the Rugby code, and it was one of these that maybe cost his side a point\\" when he conceded a penalty. During the First World War, Greaves appeared for Bury in the regional competitions, but when the Football League resumed afterwards, he \\"broke down in the opening match of the season\\", and was thereafter \\"persistently dogged by injuries to his limbs\\". Bury released him, and he returned to the north-east of England, where he was already employed as a schoolteacher in Sunderland, and signed for Darlington, a member of the newly formed Third Division North. He played in Darlington's first Football League fixture, a 2–0 win at home to Halifax Town on 27 August 1921, and went on to appear in around three-quarters of their matches over the next seven years. From April 1923 to February 1925, they remained unbeaten at home, but Greaves was involuntarily instrumental in the streak coming to an end. Opponents Lincoln City's \\"all-important point was obtained in rather a remarkable way. Endeavouring to clear a shot Greaves kicked the ball against Marshall and it rebounded off that player into the net.\\" He helped the team gain promotion in 1925, captained the team in the Second Division, and retired from the game in 1928, by which time he was aged 36.

In addition to being a professional advocate, he is also a social activist and a crusader against corruption and contested many public interest litigation targeting corruption at the highest level. His PIL in Taj corridor case led to the fall of Mayawati government in UP in 2003. His another PIL for initiating CBI enquiry in Abdul Karim Telgi fake stamp scam case involving fifty thousand crores scam in 2003 also paid results and besides the supreme court ordered CBI enquiry in this matter, union government had to introduce e-stamp to stop the circulation of fake stamp scam paper. He had filed special leave petition in public interest in Bofors scam before the supreme court when CBI failed to file it, because the permission to file SLP was denied to the CBI by the then UPA government because of the instructions by the UPA chairperson Mrs. Sonia Gandhi. He also filed a criminal writ petition in Ottavio Quattrocchi case in January 2006 when an additional Solicitor General wassent to London by the union government to get the accounts of Ottavio Quattrocchi defreezed and Hon’ble Supreme Court had passed status quo of the London accounts.

Anh. 222/19b, was probably written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in early 1765 in London. It is one of the twelve symphonies that Ludwig von Köchel only knew by its incipit in the Breitkopf & Härtel manuscript catalogue (p. 10, No. 68), which listed it as one of six symphonies (Nos. 65–70) sourced from Luigi Gatti (1740–1817), Court Kapellmeister in Salzburg from around 1782: : \\\\relative c { \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 \\\\tempo \\"Allegro non tanto\\" 2 4\\\\. 8  4 r bes8(g) g-. g-.  a16 g a bes a4 } The instrumentation for the symphony is unknown, but Alfred Einstein speculated that it would have been the same as the contemporary known symphonies K. 16 and K. 19 (strings, 2 oboes, and 2 horns). In his third edition of the Köchel catalogue, he dated it to early 1765 in London, and opined that the incipit showed the influence of J. C. Bach's symphonies. His remarks were copied unchanged by the sixth edition of the Köchel catalogue. Neal Zaslaw agreed that the opening was characteristic of J. C. Bach in his book Mozart's Symphonies, but questioned if this was a legitimate method of dating works, given that the seven symphonies of J. C. Bach beginning in this march-like way were written later than Mozart's stay in London, that Mozart himself used similar openings in later works (e.g. in the twenty-sixth symphony, K. 184/161a), and that this style of opening was much used by other composers as well in the period. Thus he opines that a stylistical analysis cannot credibly be performed until the work is rediscovered. Nevertheless, the wrapper used for the set of parts to enclose the K. 19 symphony in D had been used previously for a symphony in F (K. 19a) and then one in C (possibly K. 19b), as can be seen from the deletions and insertions on the title page, which suggested to Zaslaw that Mozart had written a C major symphony before K. 19 and that K. 19b should receive a lower Köchel number. Stephen Fischer however pointed out in his 1995 review of Zaslaw's book that the scores were parts rather than full scores, thus not constituting solid evidence for such a chronology. He also speculates that K. 19b may have been the symphony Maria Anna Mozart referred to when she remembered Wolfgang having \\"composed his first symphony with all the instruments of the orchestra, especially Trumpets and Kettledrums\\" when Leopold was dangerously ill. K. 16, though traditionally numbered as the first symphony, does not have this instrumentation: thus a lost work must be referred to. Though Zaslaw identified it with a possible E major symphony (\\"No. 0\\") possibly derived from pieces in the London Sketchbook (K. 15a–15ss), Fischer believed that the use of trumpets and timpani would be more likely for a C major symphony like K. 19b. Though the wrapper for K. 19 does not mention trumpets nor timpani, he notes that the set of parts was originally for an F-major symphony (K. 19a) and that Leopold may not have deemed it necessary to change the list of parts. The authenticity of this symphony is more credibly shown by the source attribution to Gatti in the Breitkopf & Härtel manuscript catalogue, making it plausible that it was among the six sent to Donaueschingen by Leopold Mozart in 1767.

Pleasure has also collaborated with artists such as Ray Charles, Najee, George Duke, Marion Meadows, Natalie Cole, Roberta Flack, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Peter Cetera and David Foster.  History  Pleasure was born in Hartford, Connecticut. His parents Robert and Evelyn Pleasure were originally from Louisiana, but moved to Hartford so Robert could attend Yale Divinity School from which he graduated in 1961. The family then moved to Guilford, Connecticut when young Pleasure was 7 years old. Pleasure began playing piano at age four and studied piano under Carol Wright from age seven to 17. Frequent trips to Louisiana to visit family gave Pleasure a deep exposure to and appreciation for Gospel music as many of his relatives were active in church, and gospel music was the soundtrack of their lives. And it was on these trips that he also experienced first hand the inequalities of a still segregated south. A black family traveling through the south in those times could not stop at a hotel for the night, so the family would make these trips nonstop. By the time Pleasure was a teenager, he had become proficient in trumpet, guitar, drums and violin as well. He composed his first song at age 12. He accompanied his father (an accomplished tenor) at all the Guilford high school's graduations from 1975–80 and was active in his high school's music programs. Pleasure holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in music from the University of Connecticut. Some of his main influences for playing piano/keyboards include George Duke, Joe Sample, Ramsey Lewis, Herbie Hancock, Donald Blackman, and Chick Corea. Also, Verdine White, Chuck Rainey, James Jamerson, Jaco Pastorious, Bootsy Collins, and Chuck Rainey had a strong impact on Pleasure's love for the bass guitar and his approach to playing it. Career Pleasure started his career as a bassist in 1986 when he became a member of Ray Charles' orchestra. He went on to play on Najee's 1990 album Tokyo Blue, Everette Harp's 1992 self titled LP, Marion Meadows' 1992 album Keep It Right There and Stanley Clarke's 1993 LP Live at the Greek. During 1993 Pleasure joined up with the band Earth, Wind & Fire. He later featured on Najee 's 1994 album Share My World and Marion Meadows' 1994 LP Forbidden Fruit. Pleasure then guested on jazz group Urban Knights's 1997 album Urban Knights II, Gerald Albright's 1997 LP Life To Love and produced on George Howard's 1998 album Midnight Mood. After nine years with EWF, Pleasure went on to play on Janet Jackson's All For You tour and her 2002 feature film Janet: Live in Hawaii. He then guested on Boney James's 2004 album Pure and the 2004 Jimi Hendrix tribute album Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix. Pleasure has also played with artists such as George Duke, Mary J. Blige, Chaka Khan, Roberta Flack, Natalie Cole, Frankie Beverly & Maze, Peter Cetera and David Foster. Pleasure went on to perform on Michael Jackson's 2009 feature film This Is It. He then worked with Christina Aguilera and later became the musical director of Bette Midler. Personal life He has devoted time to philanthropic efforts including fundraising for the Guilford ABC Program and Guilford High School music programs and co-founded \\"We R 1 Voice\\" with his wife Lori in 2013.

She was one of few women active in the early days of analytic aesthetics. Helen Knight, 1936 Life and education Knight was born in Swiss Cottage, London and attended Fremarch School, Hampstead. She began her BA at Bedford College, London, before coming to Cambridge University in 1921 where she took Part II Moral Sciences in 1923 and obtained a first class degree. From 1923 to 1925 she was a Research Student at Newnham College. She married psychologist Rex Knight on 30 January 1926 (they divorced in 1936), and then appears to have taken a break from academic philosophy until 1932 when she returned to Newnham as Sarah Smithson Research Fellow. She obtained her PhD in 1935. During the war she was Principal at the Board of Trade, a position that had been temporarily filled by fellow philosopher Margaret MacDonald. She also taught English at an independent girls boarding school, North Foreland Lodge in Kent from 1942 to 1949.Newnham College Roll Card Career Knight was one of a select group to whom Ludwig Wittgenstein dictated his Blue and Brown Books in the 1930s, which outline the transition in Wittgenstein's thought between his two major works, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and Philosophical Investigations. Knight became a member of the Aristotelian Society in 1922, acting in its Executive Committee for several terms. Between 1935 and 1941 she was a researcher in Aesthetics at Cambridge. During this time she published occasional papers on aesthetics for different philosophical journals (Mind, Philosophy and others). In 1945 she addressed the Aristotelian Society talking about the Women’s Graduate Club in Cambridge. “Judging by the calibre of co- presenters, discussants and commentators of her papers, her work was admired and taken seriously.”. In 1949 Knight emigrated to Australia where she was a tutor in English Literature at Janet Clarke Hall, University of Melbourne until the 1960s. She died in Melbourne, Australia aged 84. Publications Although she published scantly, her work was well received and continues to be included in modern anthologies of aesthetics. *Helen Knight (1930). Aesthetic Experience in Pictorial Art.

Buildings  The Columbia Road was contracted on 6 January 1810 by the Maryland General Assembly to establish a toll road from Ellicott City to Georgetown. The property includes a 1.5-story wood-frame house, built c. 1820, a single-story blacksmithy, a smokehouse, and the remains of a spring house. The buildings are set close to the south side of the road. The house was built by the Ridgely family, who owned the original Oakland Mills flour mill complex that appeared on the Anne Arundel County tax list in 1798. The wood stable was used to raise Percheron workhorses for local farms. Both the house and smithy are extremely well preserved; the smithy, which ceased operation in 1950, houses one complete forge and parts of a second.  Subsequent owners  In 1878, Samuel F. Whipps (1831–1909) moved from his father William Whipps' house at \\"Rebecca's Lot\\" (now Whipps Family and Public Cemetery) to Felicity. He operated the Oakland Mills post office and blacksmith shop with his son William Whipps. Future Circuit Court Judge James A. Clark Sr. worked for a Mr. Whipps on-site in the late 1800s. The property was later purchased by a Mr. and Mrs. Frank Collins. Most recently the property has been purchased by Genevieve & Thomas Engleman, who reside there with their two sons, Hank & Beau. Adjacent Oakland Mills Store and Dwelling. Circa 1798  21st century  The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. A 2001 book, \\"Roads to Howard's Past \\", boasted about the Maryland Department of Transportation circumventing the historic properties, but by 2014 the historic register was changed to declare the property was not historic. County Executive Ken Ulman was part of the 2010 ground breaking for a road-widening project in front of the historic structures. The project to increase traffic capacity and develop extra density in downtown Columbia reduced the property size, relocated Old Columbia Pike, and installed sound walls.

The series is based on the 1998 novel of the same name by British writer Nick Hornby and the 2002 film starring Hugh Grant. The episode is written by series developer Jason Katims and is directed by Jon Favreau. In the episode, a young boy named Marcus (Benjamin Stockham) and his single mother Fiona (Minnie Driver) move in next door to Will (David Walton), an unemployed bachelor living in San Francisco. Will woos a woman by pretending Marcus is his son. Plot Will is on a San Francisco trolley with his friend Andy (Al Madrigal) and Andy's two kids. Will gets off to flirt with a woman named Dakota (Leslie Bibb) who is going to a single parents' support group meeting. He lies to her, saying he is a single parent of a son named Jonah who has leukemia. She becomes attracted to him and asks to set up a play date between her daughters and his son. Will later meets his new neighbors, Fiona and her 11-year-old son Marcus. One afternoon, Fiona is about to meditate in her backyard when a waft of meat smoke from Will's barbecue catches her attention. Fiona becomes displeased and explains to him that she is a vegan. The next day, Marcus is chased home after school by three bullies. Marcus knocks on Will's door and he lets him in. Inside, the two reach an agreement—in exchange for pretending to be Will's son, Marcus wants to meet up with him after school and take part in activities which Fiona expressly disallows, such as watching television and eating ribs. When Dakota comes for a visit, she sees Marcus and assumes he is Will's son. Marcus plays along and whispers to him, \\"I own you.\\" Marcus enters the middle school talent show to cheer up his somewhat depressed mother, and he invites Will to dinner where Fiona and Marcus practice his talent show song. A few days later, Dakota and her daughters go to Will's house for a play date. Dakota goes outside to put some steaks on the grill, which results in Fiona coming over to find Marcus calling Will \\"dad\\". She accuses Will of using her son to have sex with Dakota, and that Marcus is not his friend, a charge Will does not deny. On the day of the talent show, Will rushes to the school to discourage Marcus from singing, as Marcus would be subjected to even more bullying. Marcus says he does not care because his singing makes his mother happy. Upon taking the stage, kids in the audience start mocking him and throwing things, so Will joins Marcus on keyboards and backup vocals. The performance receives a standing ovation, and Marcus and Will high-five each other and run off stage. Reception =Critical reception= \\"Pilot\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Keith Staskiewicz of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ grade, saying that it captured the \\"sweetly wry tone\\" of the Nick Hornby source material and that of the 2002 film. Mark Rozeman Paste stated that the episode \\"is a loving realized approximation that—if you can manage to approach it as its own beast—works as the sort of sentimental, character-based show that Katims does well.\\" In contrast, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times remarked, \\"Within two minutes of the pilot's opener, I found myself pining for Hugh Grant, an event that seemed impossible up until the moment it occurred.\\" Similarly, Linda Holmes of NPR criticized the episode, saying it culminated \\"in a scene that makes so many wrong choices that anyone who adores the film is likely to be specifically enraged by what seems to be an almost complete failure to comprehend what was important about that story and the way it progressed and ended.\\" Jacqueline Cutler of Zap2it said the pilot \\"does a great job introducing a callow cad, an odd boy and his strident mom.\\" IGN's Jim McMahon stated, \\"while it's not a laugh-a-minute riot, this opening episode points the way to what could eventually become a powerhouse comedy.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety described the episode as \\"an utterly charming pilot, and almost certainly the most endearing half-hour NBC has developed in some time.\\" =Ratings= The pilot episode, which followed primetime coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics, was watched by 8.26 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic.

It was built in 1889 as part of a $15,000 appropriation by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a daymark.  Construction  The Chester Rock Light was constructed in 1889 as part of a $15,000 appropriation by Congress that included several other beacons. The exact cost of the structure is unknown. Originally constructed as a 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower, the Chester Rock Light had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. First lit on July 1, 1889 with a fixed red light the light was changed to a fixed white light on December 15, 1892. According to the Light List, the light was located on Chester Rock on the west side of the Connecticut River and about north of Deep River, Connecticut. A Lighthouse Inspection Report from the United States Lighthouse Society from December 1889 states that the hexagonal tower was only accessible by boat. The light's foundation rested upon the river bottom and was a 15-foot (4.6 meter) square crib that was made of yellow pine timbers and sheathed with planks. The crib was filled with stones and protected by riprap. The crib extended up to the high water mark to a frustum of a square pyramid that is reduced to at its top and filled with stone. The sides and top are planked and the corners were covered with boiler plate and angle irons. The original light was a hexagonal beacon lantern made of brass and copper. The oil for the light was stored in boxes in the lower portion of the lantern.  Skeleton tower  According to the Annual Report of the Lighthouse Board, the tower was struck and carried away by a barge being towed by Sachem, a tugboat, on May 10, 1912. The cost of repairs, $602.40, was paid by the owner. During the intervening period, a temporary light post was used in its place. Completed on October 22, 1912, the replacement skeletal tower was a pyramidal steel structure on a concrete base that held its oil internally. The base of the tower was painted white and the daymark was painted black. The skeleton tower lantern was raised to above the water and its light had about 170 candlepower. It is unknown if a new skeleton tower was installed at a different location than the original tower or if an intervening tower was previously erected in the same location, but the original stone foundation is visible from the west bank. In 1900, the geographical coordinates were then given as 41.2354 North and 72.2602 West, but this differs from the modern GPS location which is 41.2322 North and 72.2450 West.  Service  Service records for Chester Rock Light show that the light was deactivated for the winter of 1911 and 1914. In 1914, the light was deactivated between January 12–15 and relit between March 14–16. The skeleton tower was modified in 1927, but there are no records about additional work or action with the light. In 1931, an article in The Day noted that the skeleton tower was \\"in recent years\\" converted to automatic gas beacons. As of 2014, the skeleton tower is known as Light 35 and features a green flashing light every 4 seconds. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut discovered a photo of the light and began to research its history. Joel Severance, chairman of the harbor commission, wanted to build a 28-foot (8.5 meter) tall replica that would primarily function as a daymark and their plan was endorsed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation in the United States Coast Guard and both the town of Deep River and Middlesex County, Connecticut, but it was expected to be denied by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. In 2000, the plan was rejected by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.

Amazon Fire TV (stylized as amazon fireTV) is a line of digital media player and microconsoles developed by Amazon. The devices are small network appliances that deliver digital audio and video content streamed via the Internet to a connected high-definition television. They also allow users to access local content and to play video games with the included remote control or another game controller, or by using a mobile app remote control on another device. The device is available in two form factors, set-top box and HDMI plug-in stick with, in general, lesser specifications than the contemporaneous boxes. The current set-top box model is the Fire TV Cube with embedded Amazon Echo smart speaker (which effectively replaced the Fire TV box model), while the stick form factor encompasses three models, the entry-level Fire TV Stick Lite, the standard Fire TV Stick, and the high-end Fire TV Stick 4K (the last of which effectively replaced the third-generation Fire TV with 4K Ultra HD \\"pendant\\"). The first-generation Fire TV device was unveiled on April 2, 2014. The second-generation version was released in 2015, with additional Fire TV devices released on regular basis since. In March 2016, Amazon began collaborating with television set manufacturers to include the Amazon Fire OS and Fire TV interface built-in with televisions sold to the public, labeled as Fire TV Edition. In September 2018, Amazon extended the use of the Fire TV brand to the Fire TV Recast, an over-the-air television digital video recorder exclusively for viewing use with Fire TV and Amazon Echo Show devices.  Fire TV hardware  =Original model=  First generation  The first Fire TV was made available for purchase in the US on the same day of the April 2014 announcement for US$99 and was launched with a video game called Sev Zero. Codenamed \\"Bueller\\", after the eponymous character from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, it offered HDMI audio, with support for Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound pass-through, if the user's Internet bandwidth was sufficient. According to Amazon, the Fire TV was designed to outpace competitors like the Apple TV and Roku in performance: the 0.72-inch-thick box featured a 1.7 GHz quad-core CPU (Qualcomm Snapdragon 8064), 2 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage, along with a MIMO dual-band radio for 1080p streaming over 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi and a 10/100 Ethernet connection and USB 2.0 port. Included with the box is a Bluetooth remote control with a microphone for voice search. The company said that it did not intend the Fire TV to compete with gaming consoles; instead, its gaming capabilities were geared toward people who did not already own a console but may play games on a smartphone or tablet. It has a dedicated controller accessory.  Second generation  Amazon released a second-generation Fire TV, codenamed \\"Sloane\\", after the film love interest of Ferris Bueller, in late 2015. This version had 4K resolution support, improved processor performance, and a MediaTek 8173C chipset to support H.265 (HEVC), VP8, and VP9 codecs. Wireless hardware upgrades included a dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi with 2x2 MIMO and Bluetooth 4.1. It was effectively replaced with the Fire TV Cube.l  Third generation  The third-generation Fire TV, also known as the Fire TV with 4K Ultra HD and Alexa Voice Remote, was released in 2017. It eschewed the previous set-top box design for a small, diamond-shaped \\"pendant\\" reminiscent of the Fire TV Stick, which plugs directly into a television set's HDMI port and can be hung from a short HDMI extender cable. It contained a slower processor but more RAM than the second-generation Fire TV, and also had support for 4K resolution streaming, Dolby Atmos, and HDR10. Production was discontinued in 2018 in favor of the Fire TV Stick 4K. = Fire TV Cube =  First generation  The Fire TV Cube was released in June 2018. It is similar in function to the third-generation Fire TV, but also includes embedded Alexa functionality similar to the Amazon Echo smart speaker line, and can use HDMI-CEC and an IR blaster to control other devices with voice commands. As its voice functionality is integrated into the device itself, the Fire TV Cube does not include the voice remote. The device uses a 1.5 GHz quad-core ARM 4xCA53 processor, 2 GB RAM, and 16 GB storage.  Second generation  A second-generation model was unveiled in September 2019, featuring a hexa-core processor, \\"Local Voice Control\\" (which allows client-side recognition of common voice commands to improve response time), and support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+. = Fire TV Stick = First generation Fire-TV Stick with remote (without voice search, codenamed \\"Inigo\\")  First generation  On November 19, 2014, Amazon released its Fire TV Stick, a smaller dongle version of the Fire TV that plugs into an HDMI port. Codenamed \\"Montoya\\", it retains much of the functionality of the larger Fire TV. It has 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of internal storage, weighs 0.9 oz. (25.1 g), and it uses a Broadcom BCM28155 1.0 GHz Cortex-A9 processor and a Broadcom VideoCore IV GPU. Wireless hardware includes a dual-band 802.11 a/b/g/n Wi-Fi with 2x2 MIMO and Bluetooth 3.0 Fire TV Stick - Official Site. Retrieved 8 July 2015. The Fire TV Stick is bundled with a remote control, in either of two variants: one with Alexa voice search and one without Alexa.  Second generation  Second generation Fire-TV Stick with Alexa remote (with voice search) On October 20, 2016, Amazon released the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, codenamed \\"Tank\\". Other than the new remote, the updates include MediaTek MT8127D Quad-core ARM 1.3 GHz processor with a Mali-450 MP4 GPU, and support for the H.265 (HEVC) codec. Wireless hardware upgrades includes a dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi with 2x2 MIMO and Bluetooth 4.1. It retains the 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage and weighs slightly more at 1.1 oz. (32.0 g). In January 2019, the second-generation Fire TV Stick was re-issued with the updated remote from the 4K model.  Fire TV Stick 4K  In October 2018, Amazon unveiled the Fire TV Stick 4K, codenamed \\"Mantis\\", which succeeded the third-generation Fire TV. It is upgraded to a 1.7 GHz quad-core processor and supports 4K output, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and hardware-accelerated MPEG-2 decoding. It also includes an updated voice remote that contains an infrared emitter and buttons for controlling TV power and volume (which can also be controlled with voice commands). The remote is backward compatible with previous Fire TV models, and also sold separately as an upgrade.  Fire TV Edition  Fire TV Edition is the product name applied to smart television sets produced by major television manufacturers that include Amazon Fire OS and the Fire TV interface, licensed from Amazon. They offer basic live television program information and minimal recording capabilities. Fire TV Edition television models are available from Best Buy's house brand Insignia, Toshiba (in U.S. and Canadian markets), and JVC and Grundig (in European market).  Fire TV Recast  The Fire TV Recast is a digital video recorder that works with an over-the-air antenna to record shows for later viewing on a Fire TV or an Amazon Echo Show device. It is designed for use with over-the-air TV services and is a part of the cord-cutting movement. It was announced in September 2018.  Software  The Fire TV series runs Fire OS, which is derived from Android Open Source Project source code. It supports voice commands via either a remote control with an embedded microphone, or integrated microphones inside the device (as is the case of the Fire TV Cube), and can also be controlled with Alexa via Amazon Echo smart speakers. The devices support various Amazon-owned services, including Prime Video, IMDb Freedive, as well as other major third-party services such as Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, Apple TV, HBO, Spotify, and others via Amazon Appstore. The \\"X-Ray\\" feature allows users to view contextual information related to Prime Video content (such as biographies of actors and other trivia), using face recognition, music recognition, and IMDb data.  Models   Reception  Dan Seifert from The Verge reviewed Fire TV on April 4, 2014, giving it an 8.8/10 rating and largely praising its functionality and future potential. Dave Smith from ReadWrite wrote, \\"Fire TV aims to be the cure for what ails TV set-top boxes.\\" GeekWire editor Andy Liu's review is headlined \\"Amazon's Fire TV sets a new bar for streaming boxes.\\" Ars Technica praised the device for specifications that surpassed competitors, good build quality, and a microphone works very well if you use Amazon content. The reviewer disliked the fact that its media browser puts Amazon content in the front, which makes other applications less convenient to use, limited game selection with many games not optimized, and only 5.16GB of free space, which limits the number of games that can be installed.  Main competitors  Some notable competitors include Roku, Apple TV and Chromecast.

More recently, the initial part of this period has become known as the Dutch Revolt. This concept covers the period between the initial insurrection of Netherlandish Calvinists against the regime of the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, Margaret of Parma, in 1566, and the conclusion of the so-called Twelve Years' Truce in 1609 between the Spanish Crown and the Dutch Republic. The historiography of this period covers both political and diplomatic developments, and events in military history. But the period of the Truce, and the military events that followed after the Truce had ended and the war was resumed, until the conclusion of the Peace of Münster in 1648, still form one continuous whole with the Dutch Revolt (though the \\"second part\\" of the war, after 1621, had a different character, as it now became a conflict between sovereign states, instead of a \\"domestic conflict\\" inside one polity), and this continuous narrative, spanning the period 1566–1648, is still known as the Eighty Years' War. Background Iconoclastic Fury of 1566 by Dirk van Delen King Philip II of Spain, in his capacity as sovereign of Habsburg Netherlands, continued the anti-heresy policies of his father Charles V. This caused growing resistance among the moderate nobility and population (both Catholic and dissenting) of the Netherlands. This mood of resistance first led to peaceful protests (as from the Compromise of Nobles), but in the Summer of 1566 erupted in violent protests by Calvinists, known as the iconoclastic fury, or () across the Netherlands. The Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, Margaret of Parma, as well as authorities at lower levels, feared insurrection and made further concessions to the Calvinists, such as designating certain churches for Calvinist worship. Insurrection, repression and invasion (1566–1572) Provincial stadtholders, foremost Philip of Noircarmes of Hainaut, who suppressed the revolt of the Calvinists led by Guido de Bres in Valenciennes, and William of Orange as stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland, took decisive action to quell the disturbances.Israel (1995), pp. 137-153 In March 1567 at the Battle of Oosterweel Calvinists under John of St. Aldegonde were defeated by a royalist army and all rebels summarily executed. In April 1567, Margaret reported to her brother Philip II that order had been restored.Tracy, pp. 71–72 However, by the time this news reached him in Madrid, the Duke of Alba had already been dispatched with an army to restore order.Tracy, p. 72 Rather than working with Margaret, Alba took over command and Margaret resigned in protest.Israel, p. 156 Alba established the Council of Troubles (soon to be nicknamed the Blood Council) on 5 September 1567, which conducted a campaign of repression of suspected heretics and people deemed guilty of the already extinguished insurrection. Many high-ranking officials were arrested on various pretexts, among them the Counts of Egmont and Horne who were executed for treason on 5 June 1568 while attesting to their Catholic orthodoxy on the scaffold. Of the 9,000 accused, about 1,000 were executed, and many fled into exile, including William of Orange.Tracy, pp. 77–78 Orange went into exile in his ancestral castle in Dillenburg, which became the center for plans to invade the Netherlands.Orange was a sovereign prince of the Holy Roman Empire and as such could legally make war on his \\"colleague\\" king Philip, in his capacity of sovereign of the several entities of the same Empire that together constituted the Habsburg Netherlands. Louis of Nassau, Orange's brother, crossed into Groningen from East Friesland with a mercenary army of Landsknechten, and defeated a small royalist force at Heiligerlee on 23 May 1568. Two months later, Louis' mercenary forces were smashed at the Battle of Jemmingen. Shortly thereafter, a Sea Beggars naval squadron defeated a royalist fleet in a naval battle on the Ems. However, a Huguenot army invading Artois was pushed back into France and then annihilated by the forces of Charles IX of France in June. Orange marched into Brabant, but with money running out he could not maintain his mercenary army and had to retreat.Tracy, pp. 78–79 Philip was suffering from the high cost of his war against the Ottoman Empire, and ordered Alba to fund his armies from taxes levied in the Netherlands.Parker, pp. 118–120; Parker discusses the financial difficulties the Spanish Crown almost continually encountered, when it often had to fight several wars at the same time as the war in the Netherlands, which forced it to declare bankruptcy several times; see Parker, ch. 6, Financial Resources Alba went against the States General of the Netherlands by imposing sales taxes by decree on 31 July 1571. Alba commanded local governments to collect the unpopular taxes, which alienated even loyal lower governments from the central government.Israel (1995), pp. 167–168 Rebellion (1572–1576) With the potential threat of invasions from France, Alba concentrated his force in the Southern Netherlands, in some cases removing troops from garrisons in the North.Tracy, p. 80 Capture of Brill in 1572 by Jan Luyken This left the port of Brill almost undefended. Sea Beggars expelled from England captured the city on 1 April 1572. An attempt by Count Boussu, the royalist stadtholder of Holland, to recapture the city failed.Tracy, pp. 80–81 The news of the capture of Brill led the cities of Flushing and Veere to go over to the rebels on 3 May.Tracy, p. 82 Orange quickly responded to this new development, by sending a number of emissaries to Holland and Zeeland with commissions to take over local government on his behalf, in his old capacity of stadtholder, which he now re-assumed.Israel (1995), p. 175 Diederik Sonoy persuaded the cities of Enkhuizen, Hoorn, Medemblik, Edam, Haarlem, and Alkmaar to defect to Orange. The cities of Oudewater, Gouda, Gorinchem, and Dordrecht yielded to Lumey. Leiden declared itself for Orange in a spontaneous revolt. The States of Holland, with a rebel majority,In the States of Holland 18 cities and the Ridderschap (College of Nobles) each had one vote. So a majority was constituted by ten cities. convened in the rebel city of Dordrecht,Israel (1995), pp. 174–175 and by 18 July, only the important cities of Amsterdam and Schoonhoven openly remained loyalist. Rotterdam went to the rebels soon after the first meetings in Dordrecht. Delft remained neutral for the time being.Tracy, p. 83 Count Willem IV van den Bergh, Orange's brother-in-law, captured the city of Zutphen, followed by other cities in Gelderland and neighbouring Overijssel. In Friesland rebels had seized several cities. The royalist stadtholder, Caspar de Robles sacked Dokkum in reprisal, killing many citizensIsrael (1995), p. 177 Louis of Nassau captured Mons by surprise on 24 May. Orange marched to Mons to support him, but was forced to withdraw through Mechelen, where he left a garrison. Alba had troops sack Mechelen, after which many cities hastened to pledge renewed loyalty to Alba.Israel (1995), g. 178; Tracy, p. 86 A map of Holland in 1606 by Gerardus Mercator. Note the many lakes, especially in the northern region of the province.The map looks unfamiliar, because Mercator used compass-West for the top of the page, and not compass-North as is now conventionally done. To understand the nature of Alba's subsequent campaign to reconquer the Rebel northern provinces a short digression on the military terrain in Holland is in order. It is well-known that Holland is one of the few inhabited areas in the world that are \\"below sea level.\\" This does not mean that Holland would fill up like a bath tub if the sea gained entry. As a matter of fact, the sea is only a serious threat during severe hurricanes when the tides reach extraordinary heights.Cf. St. Elizabeth's flood (1404), St. Elizabeth's flood (1421), North Sea flood of 1953 In normal times, the real danger comes from above: the low-lying areas have difficulty draining precipitation. In the 16th century, when the technology to efficiently drain those areas was still lacking, Holland was therefore covered with extensive shallow lakes, while the slightly-higher land in between consisted of waterlogged bogs. Difficult terrain for an army to maneuver in, in other words. In practice, a marching army had to use the elevated dike roads along water courses to get around in this country, and these narrow venues were easy to choke off by a determined enemy. Both the royalist and the rebel army therefore made extensive use of sconces, often apparently in the middle of nowhere, to deny their opponents freedom of movement. On the other hand, though an obstacle to a land army, a watercourse may be a transport route for one equipped with (shallow-draft) vessels. Both sides therefore tried to use water craft to circumvent each other, often while at the same time blocking the other side with new water impediments. It is important to understand, that in this war at least the rebel side did not passively accept the terrain, but actively tried to change it dynamically by inundating large areas. This was possible, because of the fact that the area has lots of subdivisions of varying depth (so-called polders), surrounded by dikes that enabled the inhabitants to manage the water table. Breaching a dike would allow water from higher areas to fill up adjoining lower areas, in theory. In practice much depended on the time of year, as water was lacking in Summer, and also the direction of the prevailing wind often frustrated attempts to speedily inundate areas. Finally it is important to remember that even in the 16th century Holland was already highly urbanized with most of the approximately 500,000 inhabitants living in towns and cities. The cities were generally walled, but the fortifications were in 1572 still of the old- fashioned Medieval variety, with curtain walls that were vulnerable to siege artillery. The architecture of the trace italienne had not yet penetrated Holland as it would soon do. Cities had their civic militias, but these were mainly used to keep order, and were of dubious value in case of a military conflict, like a siege. However, the Dutch militias already used a relatively high number of fire-arms, more so than the Spanish infantry that still mainly relied on pike men. Dutch cities already heavily relied on foreign trade for their food supply, as the surrounding countryside was more suited to dairy farming (and hence cheese production) than wheat growing. The reliance on Baltic grain, however, again made the cities vulnerable to sieges and starvation tactics.Cf. Economic history of the Dutch Republic After dealing with Orange's threat in the South, Alba sent his son Fadrique to the two rebellious provinces Gelderland and Holland. Fadrique started his campaign by sacking the fortress city of Zutphen in Gelderland. Hundreds of citizens perished and many rebellious cities in Gelderland, Overijssel and Friesland yielded.Israel (1995), p. 178 On his way to Amsterdam, Fadrique came across Naarden, which surrendered on 22 November 1572; and to set another example, Fadrique herded all of Naarden's citizens (reportedly including a Roman Catholic priest) into their church, which was subsequently set on fire. All 3,000 citizens perished. This time however, this strengthened rebellious cities in their resistance, as they realised surrender would not help them.Tracy, p. 92 Next, Fadrique approached the city of Haarlem by way of the dike road along the IJ river and the Haarlem lake, then still a large inland lake. The city had recently been reinforced with mercenary troops in the pay of the Rebel States of Holland. When Fadrique laid siege in early December, the city council secretly tried to capitulate, but the citizens, aware of the fate of Naarden, prevented this and the defenders put up a resistance. Several attempts of rebel mercenary forces, sent by Lumey and Orange to relieve the city, were repelled by the besiegers. Meanwhile, Fadrique's siege artillery repeatedly reduced sections of the city's curtain wall to rubble, and repeatedly the defenders filled these breaches with makeshift ramparts during the following nights. They made good use of their fire-arms in repelling two Spanish attempts to take the city by storm in December, and January, 1573. Starving the defenders therefore seemed the only way to success. During the Winter months, when the waterways were frozen over, the city was adequately supplied with sleds crossing the ice. However, when thaw set in Fadrique was the first to use the weapon of inundation. He had the IJ dike cut, which allowed Amsterdam war galleys to bring in men to build an important earthwork to neutralize a pesky Haarlem bastion, called theVijg, that was successfully defended by Walloon and Scottish mercenaries. To counter this move, Orange brought together a fleet of a hundred lake vessels manned with volunteers in April. This naval attempt was, however, beaten back and Haarlem was effectively cut off. An overland attempt with a large force of rebel volunteers was ambushed by the besiegers with large loss of life on the rebel side in July. Haarlem, near starvation, therefore surrendered on terms on 13 July, buying off a sack with a large Indemnity. The denial of their well- deserved sack of the city prompted Fadrique's soldiers to stage a month-long mutiny to protest their arrears in pay, during which they amused themselves with drowning hapless garrison members in the Spaarne river, though they left the citizens aloneTracy, pp. 92-93 Oudewater was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed. While the loss of Haarlem was a severe blow to the rebel cause, the siege had given the rebels time to improve their defenses. The Siege of Alkmaar resulted in a rebel victory after the sluice gates were opened and the area surrounding the city was flooded, making a further siege impossible.Israel (1995), p. 180 The city of Geertruidenberg was captured in a night-time surprise attack by an English, French Huguenot and Fleming force on 28 August, and in October a Spanish attempt to take Delft and its environs failed, which further boosted the morale of the rebels. Sea Beggar fleet in 1573 In the Battle on the Zuiderzee on 11 October, a Sea Beggar squadron defeated the royalist fleet, led by Count Boussu, thus placing the Zuiderzee under rebel control. A blockade against the royalist city of Amsterdam was established. The Battle of Borsele and the Battle of Reimerswaal established naval superiority for the rebels in Zeeland, and led to the fall of Middelburg in 1574, which had been besieged by the rebels since 1572.Israel (1995), p. 181 In November, Fadrique started the Siege of Leiden. The first stage of the siege ended in March 1574, when the Spanish troops had to deal with a mercenary force led by Orange's brothers Louis and Henry of Nassau-Dillenburg. They engaged the Spanish troops at Mookerheyde, which ended in a clear Spanish victory.Tracy, p. 95 The second stage of the siege of Leiden started in May. The polders surrounding Leiden were flooded and a Sea Beggar fleet managed to lift the siege on 2 October.Tracy, p. 97The inundation served its purpose, but at tremendous cost to the civilian population, as it took about seven years for things to return to normal. This did not escape Alba's notice, who seems to have considered the possibility of permanently inundating the entire province of Holland. The project was vetoed by king Philip II, however. Cf. Gilles de Berlaymont, lord of Hierges, the last royalist stadtholder of Holland, captured and sacked Schoonhoven, and Oudewater in August 1575.Tracy, p. 99 By this time, Alba had been replaced as Regent of the Netherlands by Requesens. In the summer of 1575, Requesens ordered Cristobal de Mondragon to attack the Zeeland city of Zierikzee, which surrendered on 2 July 1576; however, the Spanish troops mutinied and left Zierikzee. Philip had not been able to pay his troops for two years, since he defaulted on all government debts in September 1575 and his creditors did not extend further credit.Koenigsberger, p. 262; Parker, p.127; Parker mentions that Spain had to default on its loans in 1560 (after a war with France), 1575, 1596, 1607, 1627, 1647 and 1653, every time putting the war effort in jeopardy; the 1575 default led directly to the 1576 mutiny of foreign troops in the Army of Flanders. From Pacification of Ghent to Union of Utrecht (1576–1579) The Spanish mutineers marched on Brussels, on the way sacking the city of Aalst. The loyal provinces had reluctantly backed the royal government against the Rebellion so far, but now a loyal city had been sacked. After the death of Requesens the States of Brabant raised their own troops to protect Brussels. Philipe de Croÿ, Duke of Aerschot, stadtholder of Flanders took over government and allowed the States-General to start peace negotiations with the States of Holland and Zeeland. All agreed that the Spanish troops should be withdrawn. There was also agreement on the suspension of the placards against heresy and freedom of conscience. The Pacification of Ghent was signed after the Spanish mutineers went on a murderous rampage in the city of Antwerp on 4 November.Koenigsberger, pp. 260–272; Tracy, pp. 135–136 The next regent, Juan de Austria arrived on 3 November, too late to influence events. The States-General induced Juan de Austria's agreement to the Pacification of Ghent in the Perpetual Edict on 12 February 1577. The Spanish troops were withdrawn. Juan broke with the States-General in July, and fled to the safety of the citadel of Namur.Tracy, pp. 137–138 The Dutch Maiden in the GardenIn old Dutch the word for \\"garden\\" often means \\"fence.\\" of Holland by Philip Galle Philip's financial difficulties were straightened out by the end of 1577.The system of \\"contributions\\" Requesens adopted in 1574 outside the areas where regular taxes could be collected, helped to augment revenue from the Netherlands (though it did not help avert the mutiny of 1576). Parma later \\"improved\\" on this system of forced contributions by regularizing the arbitrary exactions of the Spanish troops in the form of brandschattingen, to a system of formalized extortions, in which communities paid \\"protection money\\" to the Spanish \\"superintendent of contributions\\" to avoid being sacked, Parker, pp. 120–122 This enabled him to send a new Spanish army from Italy, under the command of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. These troops arrived in January 1578, and were soon venturing into the territory of the States-General. Parma routed the States-General's troops in the Battle of Gembloux on 31 January, allowing royalist forces to advance to Leuven. New troops raised by the States General with support of Elizabeth I of England defeated the Spanish armies at the Rijmenam.Tracy, p. 141 The States-General were not able to exploit their advantage. Parma became the new governor general after the death of Juan de Austria and laid siege to Maastricht in 1579. Parma's troops entered the city on 29 June. Parma and his deputies were unable to prevent a massacre of the garrison or Maastricht's civilians.Tracy, p. 142 Holland had started the construction of a ring defence of trace- italienne type fortresses to stop Spanish armies roaming around in their lands.Tracy, pp. 149–150 Among the new fortresses were Geertruidenberg, Zevenbergschen Hoek (both across the Hollands Diep in Brabant, as the north bank of that estuary was sparsely populated), Gorinchem, Loevestein castle and Woudrichem (at important confluences of rivers), Muiden and Naarden (on the eastern approaches of Amsterdam).Tracy, p. 150 The remaining royalist cities in Holland were won over to the rebel cause. Haarlem, Weesp and Muiden swore allegiance to Orange as stadtholder for the States-General on 22 January 1577.Tracy, p. 152 Amsterdam was a harder nut to crack, as the regime in that city was more intransigently royalist. On the other hand, they had cause for complaint as the Sea-Beggar navy continued to informally blockade Amsterdam's trade in contravention of the Pacification. When help from Don Juan proved infeasible, Amsterdam sued for an arrangement in September. The States of Holland, however, preferred to subdue the city by force, instead of engaging in negotiations (despite Orange's imprecations). Dutch troops started to invest Amsterdam, but thanks to mediation by the States of Utrecht (a province that had been consistently on the royalist side during the Rebellion) a \\"Satisfaction\\" was agreed on February 8, 1578. Calvinist exiles were to be allowed to return, but they would not be free to worship according to their preference; only the Catholic religion would be practiced. This was the mirror image of conditions elsewhere in Holland. The old militias would be re-formed, and Amsterdam would not be liable for debts of the States contracted during the Rebellion. However, after the return of the exiles they staged a bloodless coup on May 24, ousting the city government and expelling its members from the city. This so-called \\"Alteration\\" brought Amsterdam again fully into the fold of the Dutch province, and eliminated the strategically dangerous chink it had formed in its armour.Tracy, pp. 153–4 Alliances between Holland, Utrecht and Gelderland were created to increase border defence.Tracy, p. 156 This left many cities in Holland over-garrisoned, and these companies of mercenaries were given in the service of the States-General allowing the establishment of garrisons in the Southern provinces (e.g. in Mechelen, Antwerp, Brussels and Maastricht), and fighting Hierges from Utrecht and the Germans of Nicholas von Polweiler from around RoermondTracy, p. 159; Israel (1995), pp. 191–192 Though at first the interests of Holland and the States-General in this sense converged, they started to diverge the more gains Parma made in the South. For Orange and the States-General the theater of Brabant was pre-eminent in the war, but by 1579 Holland had a greater interest in using its troops to protect its friends in the eastern provinces. The same went for its money, which may have been even more important. With Holland being more and more reluctant to help finance the war for the States-General, the military situation got more and more dire for the latter, which allowed Parma to make threatening gains in the direction of areas of strategic interest for Holland in the east etc.; a vicious spiral in other words. If the Dutch Regenten had seen the strategic implications of Parma's advances, like Orange did, things might have turned out differently, but unfortunately they did not. Instead they preferred to formalize a defensive union with their by now generally friendly eastern and northern neighbors. The interest of the States of Holland became evermore focused on the interest of the Northern provinces, and in spite of warnings of Orange, Holland formalised the defensive Union of Utrecht with its eastern and northern neighbours, on 23 January.Israel (1995), pp. 188-196The treaty is often called the \\"constitution\\" of the Dutch Republic. This is only partially true, however. This \\"constitution\\" in the main consisted of the constitutional framework that had organically grown in the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands in the previous decades, which structure was simply retained by the Republic. However, the articles of the treaty provided additional building blocks for the constitution by providing an explicit framework for the budding Confederation. It was signed in the city of Utrecht by the representatives of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, the Ommelanden around Groningen city, and the stadtholder of Gelderland, Orange's brother Jan, who presumed to sign for the divided States of Gelderland. Ironically, Jan van Nassau was reluctantly accepted by the anti-Orange and anti-Holland bloc in the Gelderland States, because they mistook him for a Lutheran moderate, and as such a bulwark against Calvinist encroachments; Israel (1995), p. 191 Secession and reconquest (1579–1588) Ironically, the conservative Walloon provinces had signed their own defensive Union of Arras on 6 January 1579. The treaty was initially signed by Hainault, Artois and Walloon Flanders and reconfirmed the Pacification and the Perpetual Edict, in addition to neutrality with Spain. In return, Spain was to refrain basing its troops in the provinces. Once Parma accepted these conditions the grievances of the conservative Catholics against Spain were satisfied and they could make a separate peace in the form of the Treaty of Arras in May, in which they renewed their allegiance to Philip.Koenigsberger, pp. 290–291 Meanwhile, Orange and the States-General in Antwerp were less than enthusiastic about the Union of Utrecht. They would far prefer a broader based union, still based on the Pacification and the \\"religious peace\\", which both the unions of Utrecht and Arras implicitly rejected. However, rapid developments in divergent directions in both north and south made the attempts at maintaining unity moot. In the north the adherents of the Union of Utrecht managed to consolidate their position in the provinces of Friesland and Gelderland by May, though not without a struggle with the conservatives. However, Overijssel remained divided and in Groningen the city and the stadtholder for the States-General, Count Rennenberg, kept their distance. By the time of the Treaty of Arras it was clear that the split had hardened, and Orange therefore finally conceded defeat and signed the Union of Utrecht on 3 May, while encouraging the Flemish and Brabant cities in Protestant hands to also join the Union.Israel (1995), pp. 201–2 Allegory: a Spanish soldier menaces the Dutch maiden with a dagger against a background of executions and battle, print from Johannes Gysius: Oorspronck ende voortgang der Neder-landtscher beroerten ende ellendicheden, 1616 At this time, on the initiative of Emperor Rudolph II a final attempt was made to attain a general peace between Philip and the States-General in the German city of Cologne. As both sides insisted on mutually exclusive demands these peace talks only served to make the irreconcilability of both parties obvious; there appeared to be no more room for the people who favoured the middle ground, like Count Rennenberg. Rennenberg, a Catholic, now made up his mind to go over to Spain. In March 1580 he called for the provinces in his remit to rise against the \\"tyranny\\" of Holland and the Protestants. However, this only served to unleash an anti-Catholic backlash in Friesland and Overijssel. The States of Overijssel were finally convinced to adhere to the Union of Utrecht. Nevertheless, Rennenberg's \\"treason\\" posed a severe strategic threat for the Union, especially after Parma sent him reinforcements in June. He managed to capture most of Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel in the next months.Israel (1995), pp. 205–208 The territory under nominal States-General control was steadily shrinking in other parts also. Parma made steady progress. After taking Maastricht in June 1579, he seized Kortrijk in February 1580, after a four-month siege. The States-General replied by recapturing Mechelen in April after which the victorious English mercenaries sacked the town in what has become known as the English Fury.Israel (1995), p. 208 Orange by now was convinced that the only way to avert total defeat was to regain support of the moderates, alienated by Calvinist radicalism; reassure the still-loyal Catholics in the South; and retain the trust of the German Lutheran princes and the king of France. To attain these objectives he now persuaded the States-General to offer sovereignty over the Netherlands to the younger brother of king Henri of France, François, Duke of Anjou, who in 1578 had already intervened on behalf of the States-General. Anjou was an orthodox Catholic, but also a Politique, who in 1576 had brought about the Edict of Beaulieu, which for a while ensured religious peace in France. As such he was acceptable to moderates in both camps. He also would bring the military and financial support of his brother. Brabant and Flanders (but not Holland and Zeeland) supported this scheme and the States-General concluded the Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours in September with Anjou. The latter arrived in Antwerp in January 1581, where he took an oath to in effect govern as a \\"constitutional monarch\\", and was acclaimed by the States-General as Protector of the NetherlandsThe role of the Archduke Matthias as nominal governor-general had now become superfluous, and he was bought off with a generous annuity in March [1581]; Israel (1995), pp. 208–9 Siege of Steenwijk in 1580–81 by Count Rennenberg The secession of the States-General and the area under their nominal control from the Spanish Crown was formalised by the Act of Abjuration of 26 July 1581. The main effect of this Act was to force a number of \\"fence- sitting\\" magistrates in the rebellious provinces to finally declare their true allegiance. Many old-guard regents now resigned and were replaced with people whose loyalty to the anti-Spanish cause was not in doubt. The Act also intensified the propaganda war between both sides, as it took the form of a manifest, setting out the principles of the Revolt, just as Orange's Apologie in answer to Philip's ban of June, outlawing him, had done. Both documents are redolent of resistance theories that were also disseminated by the Huguenot Monarchomachs.Though Van Gelderen maintains that the Dutch versions actually antedate the monarchomach publications; Van Gelderen, pp. 269–276 As such they alienated yet another group of moderates.Israel (1995), pp. 209–11 Unfortunately, Orange's attempt to paper over the disunity within the States- General by bringing in Anjou did not succeed. Holland and Zeeland acknowledged him perfunctorily, but mainly ignored him, and of the other members of the Union of Utrecht Overijssel, Gelderland and Utrecht never even recognised him. In Flanders his authority never amounted to much either, which meant that only Brabant fully supported him. Under Anjou's nominal direction the split between the north and south was further emphasised. He governed with a Council of State that, though nominally unitary, was in practice divided in two distinct bodies, each responsible for a different theatre of war. Anjou himself concentrated his French troops in the south, leaving Holland and its allies to fend for themselves against Rennenberg (which suited them fine). He proved signally unable to staunch Parma's inexorable advance, however.Israel (1995), p. 212 Spanish attack on a Flemish village by Peter Snayers Ironically, Parma had long been hampered by the provision in the Treaty of Arras which prohibited stationing of Spanish mercenaries (the troops of the best quality) in the provinces that belonged to the Southern union. However, after his war with the Turks had finally ended, Philip's finances had significantly improved and he had been able to steadily increase the number of troops available to Parma. By October 1582, Parma had an army of 61,000 troops available, mostly of high quality. By that time the Walloon provinces also relented their opposition against taking in Spanish troops. These improvements were soon translated into military successes. In June 1581 Parma had already captured Orange's own town of Breda, thereby driving a wedge into the territory of the States-General in Brabant. In 1582 he made further advances into Gelderland and Overijssel There the war had been going to and fro between the forces of the Union of Utrecht and the royalists. Rennenberg had died in the Summer of 1581, but was ably replaced by Francisco Verdugo, who defeated the English mercenaries of Sir John Norris (of Rijmenam fame) opposing him in Friesland at the Battle of Noordhorn. He was in turn defeated by Norreys in trying to capture the important fort at Niezijl. Verdugo then pushed south – capturing Lochem would topple Zutphen and Deventer. However he was forced to lift his siege of Lochem, but on his way back north captured the fortress city of Steenwijk, the key to the north-east of the Netherlands, which always had eluded Rennenberg.Tracy, pp. 168–169 Orange was the victim of an assassination attempt by Juan de Jáuregui on 18 March 1582. He survived, but suffered severe injuries which put him out of the running for an appreciable time. Meanwhile, Anjou had become weary of the restraints placed on his authority by the civilians of the States-General and he attempted to seize power in Flanders and Brabant by way of a military coup. He seized Dunkirk and several other Flemish cities, but in Antwerp the citizens (remembering 1576) came to arms and massacred the French troops in the streets, an event known as the French Fury of 17 January 1583. The popularity of both Anjou and Orange (who was seen as his main promotor) now sank to new lows, especially in Antwerp. Nevertheless, Orange tried to arrange a reconciliation, but both Anjou and the people of Brabant had had enough and Anjou left for France in June.Israel (1995), p. 213 battle of Steenbergen in 1583 Morale in the cities still held by the States-General in the South sagged. Dunkirk and Nieuwpoort fell without a shot to Parma, leaving only Oostende as a major rebel enclave along the coast. In despair, Orange now left Brabant for good. He again established his headquarters in the Dutch city of Delft in July 1583, followed by the States- General in August (the latter eventually settled in nearby The Hague). He was back where he started from in 1576. His prestige with the States of Holland and Zeeland had appreciably declined since those halcyon days, however. The States had since greatly increased their self-confidence as a budding government.Israel (1995), pp. 213–4 Meanwhile, Parma's Army of Flanders made inexorable progress. It captured Ypres in April 1584, Bruges in May, and Ghent in September. In this desperate situation Orange started to entertain thoughts of finally accepting the vacant crown of the Count of Holland, which some of his ardent supporters, notably Paulus Buys, had first pressed upon him in 1581. However, since that time enthusiasm had waned, and Amsterdam (led by the regent Cornelis Hooft), Gouda and Middelburg now opposed the plan. In any case, the plan became moot when Orange was assassinated by Balthasar Gérard on 10 July 1584.Israel (1995), pp. 214–6 The assassination for a while put the States of Holland in disarray, which left the initiative to the much diminished States of Flanders and Brabant in the States-General. The latter were by now getting desperate as they controlled only slivers of their provinces (Parma had by now put Antwerp under siege). They believed that their only succour could come from France. On their behest the States-General therefore started a debate on the merit of once more offering sovereignty to king Henri III of France in September, and over Hooft's and Amsterdam's objections a Dutch embassy was sent to France in February 1585. But the situation in France had deteriorated, the religious strife between Huguenots and Catholics flaring up again, and Henri did not feel strong enough to defy Philip, so he declined the honour.Israel (1995), pp. 218–9 siege of Antwerp, 1584–1585. Print from Famiano Strada Meanwhile, the \\"Calvinist republic\\" of Antwerp was being brought to heel by Parma. He had cut its supply-line from the north by placing a pontoon bridge across the Scheldt river downstream from the city. The usual starvation tactic now began to take hold on the city of 80,000. Morale declined, also because one of the last Brabant holdouts, Brussels, surrendered in March 1585. After a Dutch amphibious assault (during which an attempt was made to blow up the ship-bridge with the use of \\"Hellburners\\") failed in April, the city finally surrendered in August. Parma (who was well aware of the counter-productivity of Alba's terror tactics) treated the inhabitants leniently, but many Protestants nevertheless migrated to the northern provinces, swelling the stream of often wealthy merchants and skilled labourers with a Protestant background that sought refuge there in this period. A side effect of this wholesale migration was that the economic strength of the reconquered provinces steadily declined, while that of especially Holland and Zeeland mightily increased.Israel (1995), p. 219 The States-General in their extremity now turned to the English monarch Elizabeth I with an offer of sovereignty. Elizabeth had been approached as early as 1573 by the States of Holland with a similar offer for the province, but then she haughtily declined, as she generally disapproved of rebellion (and Dutchmen). Now, however, the English government reconsidered in view of the gains Parma was making, which also had the unwanted effect of strengthening Catholic anti- government sentiment in England. Elizabeth (though declining to take up the offer of sovereignty) therefore decided to extend an English protectorate over the Netherlands, be it under strict conditions to protect her interests. She offered to send an expeditionary force of 6,350-foot and 1,000 horse, the cost to be shared by the States-General, provided her nominee, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, would be put in both military and political charge of the country as governor-general. Furthermore, he should govern through a reconstituted Council of State, on which the English government would have two voting members (one of which was the Clerk of the Privy Council, Sir Thomas Wilkes), and she was to be given the fortresses of Flushing and Brill as surety for the loans she extended. The States-General agreed to this in the Treaty of Nonsuch of 20 August. This was the first instance in which the rebel state was diplomatically recognised by a foreign government (the treaty with Anjou having been \\"private\\").Israel (1995), pp. 219–20 Leicester's intervention in the Netherlands proved to be a mixed blessing. He was to be a rallying point for the forces in the Netherlands that were opposed to the hegemony of the States of Holland. As a protector of the Puritans in England, he was seen as a natural ally by the \\"strict\\" faction of Calvinists in the Netherlands, who had opposed Orange's policy of \\"religious peace\\" and now were arrayed against the \\"lax\\" Dutch regents who favoured an Erastian Church order, a bone of contention for many years to come. Those Dutch regents, ably led by the Land's Advocate of Holland, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, opposed Leicester from the start because they rightly identified him as the focus of the opposition in the Netherlands to the power they had acquired during the course of the Revolt. Beside the hard-line Calvinists, that opposition consisted of the Dutch nobility, whose power had declined in favour of that of the despised merchant class that the regents represented, and the factions in the other provinces, such as Utrecht and Friesland, that heartily resented Holland's supremacy.Israel (1995), pp. 221–2 The first conflict arose during the negotiations with Leicester in January 1586 over the exact contents of his commission as governor-general. The Treaty of Nonsuch provided that stadtholders for the individual provinces would henceforth be appointed by the Council of State, so as to give England a say in the matter. Nevertheless, in Friesland and Groningen William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg (the son of Orange's brother Jan), and in Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel Adolf van Nieuwenaar had been appointed by the States-General in early 1585, before the treaty. In a show of bad faith the States of Holland and Zeeland had then appointed the second legitimate son of Orange, Maurice of Nassau,Orange's eldest son, Philip William, now the Prince of Orange, was in Spanish hands; the second son Justinus van Nassau, was illegitimate. stadtholder in their provinces just before Leicester arrived. To add insult to injury, the States insisted that all stadtholders derived their authority from the sovereign States of the provinces that appointed them, so Leicester could claim no say in the matter (an argument that would play an important role in future constitutional conflicts). Confronted with this fait accompli he had no choice but to acquiesce.Israel (1995), p. 224 Leicester also clashed with Holland over matters of policy like the representation of the States of Brabant and Flanders, who by now no longer controlled any significant areas in their provinces, in the States-General. From 1586 on they were barred from taking part in the deliberations over Leicester's objection, though he managed to retain their seats in the Council of State for them. Once the States-General were thus deprived of the membership of the last Southern provinces, one may in effect start using the name Dutch Republic for the new state. Holland also opposed Leicester's embargo on \\"trade with the enemy.\\" Superficially, this made sense from a strategic point of view, and the embargo proved quite effective after Leicester put it in force in April, causing much hardship in the Spanish-controlled territories in the next Winter. However, the embargo also hit the Dutch merchants very hard, as much of the grain trade on the Baltic was now diverted to England. The Dutch regents therefore preferred a system of control with licenses that had the added benefit of bringing in much-needed revenue. For the moment Leicester prevailed on this point, however.Israel (1995), pp. 225–6 The political strains between Leicester and Holland intensified when the Calvinist hard-liners, in Utrecht, led by Gerard Prouninck, seized power in that province in August. This provided Leicester with an anti-Holland power base from which he could make difficulties for the Dutch regents in other provinces, especially Friesland, also. When Leicester temporarily returned to England in December, Holland immediately set to work to recover the lost ground. New regulations were put in force that required every officer in the pay of Holland to accept his commission from the stadtholder, Maurice, who also had to approve all troop movements. Leicester's trade embargo was emasculated. Meanwhile, much mutual irritation had arisen between the Dutch populace and the English troops garrisoned in many towns. In January 1587 the English garrisons at Deventer and Zutphen defected to Spain, followed by those in Zwolle, Arnhem and Ostend. This contributed to anti- English feeling under the populace, which helped undermine the pro-English Utrecht faction, that had been agitating for offering sovereignty to Elizabeth once again. When Leicester returned to the Netherlands he found his friends weakened so much that he concluded that he would have to seize power by force to get the situation under control. After preparations during the Summer, Leicester occupied Gouda, Schoonhoven and a few other cities in September. An attempt to arrest Maurice and Oldenbarnevelt in The Hague failed, however, as did an attempted insurrection of hardline Calvinists in Leiden. When a personal attempt by Leicester to get Amsterdam in his camp also failed, he gave up and returned to England in December. Thus ended the last attempt to keep the Netherlands a \\"mixed monarchy\\", under foreign government. The northern provinces now entered a period of more than two centuries of republican government.Israel (1995), pp. 228–30 The Dutch Republic resurges (1588–1609) =Politics of the Dutch Republic= The Dutch Republic was not proclaimed with great fanfare. In fact, after the departure of Leicester the States of the several provinces and the States-General conducted business as usual. To understand why, one has to look at the polemic that took place during 1587 about the question who held sovereignty. The polemic was started by the English member of the Council of State, Sir Thomas Wilkes, who published a learned Remonstrance in March, in which he attacked the States of Holland because they undermined the authority of Leicester to whom, in Wilkes view, the People of the Netherlands had transferred sovereignty in the absence of the \\"legitimate prince\\" (presumably Philip). The States of Holland reacted with an equally learned treatise, drawn up by the pensionary of the city of Gouda, François VranckEntitled in translation:Short exposition of the right exercised from old times by the knighthood, nobles and towns of Holland and Westvriesland for the maintenance of the liberties, rights, privileges and laudable customs of the country; Van Gelderen, p. 204 on their behalf, in which it was explained that popular sovereignty in Holland (and by extension in other provinces) in the view of the States resided in the vroedschappen and nobility, and that it was administered by (not transferred to) the States, and that this had been the case from time immemorial. In other words, in this view the republic already existed so it did not need to be brought into being.Van Gelderen, p. 209; Koenigsberger, pp. 308–10 Vranck's conclusions reflected the view of the States at that time and would form the basis of the ideology of the States-Party faction in Dutch politics, in their defence against the \\"monarchical\\" views of their hard-line Calvinist and Orangist enemies in future decades.Van Gelderen, pp. 206–7 The aftermath of the plundering of the village of Wommelgem in 1589, by Sebastiaan Vrancx The latter (and many contemporary foreign observers and later historians) often argued that the confederal government machinery of the Netherlands, in which the delegates to the States and States-General constantly had to refer back to their principals in the cities, \\"could not work\\" without the unifying influence of an \\"eminent head\\" (like a Regent or Governor-General, or later a stadtholder). However, the first years of the Dutch Republic proved different (as in hindsight the experience with the States-General since 1576, ably managed by Orange, had proved). Oldenbarnevelt proved to be Orange's equal in virtuosity of parliamentary management. The government he informally led proved to be quite effective, at least as long as the war lasted.Koenigsberger, p. 313 In the three years after 1588 the position of the Republic improved appreciably, despite setbacks like the betrayal of Geertruidenberg to Parma by its English garrison in 1588.Israel (1995), p. 234 The change was due to both external and internal factors that were interrelated. =Economics and demographic changes in the Netherlands= Internally, probably thanks to the influx of Protestant refugees from the South, which temporarily became a flood after the fall of Antwerp in 1585, the long-term economic boom was ignited that in its first phase would last until the second decade of the next century. The southern migrants brought the entrepreneurial qualities, capital, labour skills and know-how that were needed to start an industrial and trade revolution. The economic resources that this boom generated were easily mobilised by the budding \\"fiscal-military state\\" in the Netherlands, that had its origin, ironically, in the Habsburg attempts at centralisation earlier in the century. Though the Revolt was in the main motivated by resistance against this Spanish \\"fiscal-military state\\" on the absolutist model, in the course of this resistance the Dutch constructed their own model that, though explicitly structured in a decentralised fashion (with decision-making at the lowest, instead of the highest level) was at least as efficient at resource mobilisation for war as the Spanish one. This started in the desperate days of the early Revolt in which the Dutch regents had to resort to harsh taxation and forced loans to finance their war efforts. However, in the long run these very policies helped reinforce the fiscal and economic system, as the taxation system that was developed formed an efficient and sturdy base for the debt- service of the state, thereby reinforcing the trust of lenders in the credit- worthiness of that state. Innovations, such as the making of a secondary market for forced loans by town governments helped merchants to regain liquidity, and helped start the financial system that made the Netherlands the first modern economy. Though in the early 1590s this fiscal-military state was only in its early stages and not as formidable as it would become in the next century, it still already made the struggle between Spain and the Dutch Republic less unequal than it had been in the early years of the Revolt.Glete, pp. 145–55 =The Spanish Armada= Externally, the preparations Philip was making for an invasion of England were all too evident. This growing threat prompted Elizabeth to take a more neutral stance in the Netherlands. Oldenbarnevelt proceeded unhindered to break the opposition.Israel (1995), pp. 235–7 She appreciated that she needed Dutch naval co-operation to defeat the threatened invasion and that opposing Oldenbarnevelt's policies, or supporting his enemies, was unlikely to get it. The position of Holland was also improved when Adolf of Nieuwenaar died in a gunpowder explosion in October 1589, enabling Oldenbarnevelt to engineer his succession as stadtholder of Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel by Maurice, with whom he worked hand in glove.Israel (1995), p. 237 The Spanish armada by Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom Oldenbarnevelt managed to wrest power away from the Council of State, with its English members (though the Council would have an English representation until the English loans were repaid by the end of the reign of James I). Instead, military decisions were more and more made by the States-General (with its preponderant influence of the Holland delegation), thereby usurping important executive functions from the Council.Israel (1995), pp. 238–40 The role of the budding Dutch navy in the defeat of the Spanish Armada in August 1588, has often been under-exposed. It was crucial, however. After the fall of Antwerp the Sea-Beggar veterans under admiral Justinus van Nassau (the illegitimate elder brother of Maurice) had been blockading Antwerp and the Flemish coast with their nimble flyboats. These mainly operated in the shallow waters off Zeeland and Flanders that larger warships with a deeper draught, like the Spanish and English galleons, could not safely enter. The Dutch therefore enjoyed unchallenged naval superiority in these waters, even though their navy was inferior in naval armament. An essential element of the plan of invasion, as it was eventually implemented, was the transportation of a large part of Parma's Army of Flanders as the main invasion force in unarmed barges across the English Channel. These barges would be protected by the large ships of the Armada. However, to get to the Armada, they would have to cross the zone dominated by the Dutch navy, where the Armada could not go. This problem seems to have been overlooked by the Spanish planners, but it was insurmountable. Because of this obstacle, England never was in any real danger. However, as it turned out, the English navy defeated the Armada before the embarkation of Parma's army could be implemented, turning the role of the Dutch moot. The Army of Flanders escaped the drowning death Justinus and his men had in mind for them, ready to fight another day. (1991) \\"Of Providence and Protestant Winds: the Spanish Armada of 1588 and the Dutch armada of 1688\\", in: The Anglo-Dutch moment. Essays on the Glorious Revolution and its world impact. Cambridge U.P., ; pp. 349–51 =Dutch Army reforms= Musket instruction by Jacob de Gheyn II Henry IV of France's succession to the French throne in 1589 occasioned a new civil war in France, in which Philip soon intervened on the Catholic side. He ordered Parma to use the Army of Flanders for this intervention and this put Parma in the unenviable position of having to fight a two-front war. There was at first little to fear from the Dutch, and he had taken the added precaution of heavily fortifying a number of the cities in Brabant and the north-eastern Netherlands he had recently acquired, so he could withdraw his main army to the French border with some confidence. However, this offered the Dutch a respite from his relentless pressure that they soon put to good use. Under the two stadtholders, Maurice and William Louis, the Dutch States Army was in a short time thoroughly reformed from an ill-disciplined, ill-paid rabble of mercenary companies from all over Protestant Europe, to a well-disciplined, well-paid professional army, with many soldiers, skilled in the use of modern fire-arms, like arquebuses, and soon the more modern muskets. The use of these fire-arms required tactical innovations like the counter-march of files of musketeers to enable rapid volley fire by ranks; such complicated manoevres had to be instilled by constant drilling. As part of their army reform the stadtholders therefore made extensive use of military manuals, often inspired by classical examples of Roman infantry tactics, such as the ones edited by Justus Lipsius in De Militia Romana of 1595. Jacob de Gheyn II later published an elaborately illustrated example of such a manual under the auspices of Maurice, but there were others. These reforms were in the 17th century emulated by other European armies, like the Swedish army of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. But the Dutch army developed them first.Israel (1995), pp. 267–71; Glete, pp. 155–62 Besides these organisational and tactical reforms, the two stadtholders also developed a new approach to siege warfare. They appreciated the peculiar difficulties of the terrain for this type of warfare in most of the Netherlands, which necessitated much labour for the digging of investments. Previously, many soldiers disdained the manual work required and armies usually press-ganged hapless peasants. Maurice, however, required his soldiers to do the digging, which caused an appreciable improvement in the quality of the work. Maurice also assembled an impressive train of siege artillery, much larger than armies of the time usually had available, which enabled him to systematically pulverise enemy fortresses. He was to put this to good use, when the Republic went on the offensive in 1591. Capture of Breda in 1590 by use of a Peat boat – by Jan Luyken Already in 1590 Breda was recaptured with a ruse from which having been aided considerably by an English army under Sir Francis VereKnight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, pp 36–40 and Maurice used his much enlarged armyIt grew from 20,000 in 1588 to 32,000 by 1595; Israel (1995), p. 242 with newly developed transportation methods using rivercraft, to sweep the IJssel-river valley, capturing Zutphen and Deventer; then invade the Ommelanden in Groningen, capturing all Spanish forts and defeated Parma during the Siege of Knodsenburg. He ended the campaign with the conquest of Hulst in Flanders and then Nijmegen in Gelderland. In one fell swoop this transformed the eastern part of the Netherlands, which had hitherto been in Parma's hands. The next year Maurice joined his cousin William Louis in the siege of Steenwijk, pounding that strongly defended fortress with 50 artillery pieces, that fired 29,000 shot. The city surrendered after 44 days. During the same campaign year the formidable fortress of Coevorden was also reduced; it surrendered after a relentless bombardment of six weeks. Drenthe was now brought under control of the States-General.Israel (1995), pp. 241–5 Siege of Groningen in 1594, by Jan Janssonius Despite the fact that Spanish control of the northeastern Netherland now hung by a thread, Holland insisted that first Geertruidenberg would be captured, which happened after an epic textbook siege, which even the great ladies of The Hague treated as a tourist attraction, in June 1593. Only the next year the stadtholders concentrated their attention on the northeast again, where meanwhile the particularist forces in Friesland, led by Carel Roorda, were trying to extend their hegemony over the other north-eastern provinces. This was temporarily resolved by a solution imposed by Holland, putting Friesland in its place, which the Frisians understandably resented. Holland also attempted to avoid the expense of a lengthy siege of the strongly defended and strongly pro-Spanish city of Groningen by offering that city an attractive deal that would maintain its status in its eternal conflict with the Ommelanden. This diplomatic initiative failed however, and Groningen was subjected to a two-month siege. After its capitulation on July 22, 1594, the city was treated \\"leniently\\", though Catholic worship was henceforth prohibited and the large body of Catholic clergy that had sought refuge in the city since 1591 forced to flee to the Southern Netherlands. The province of Groningen, City and Ommelanden, was now admitted to the Union of Utrecht, as the seventh voting province under a compromise imposed by Holland, that provided for an equal vote for both the city and the Ommelanden in the new States of Groningen. In view of the animosity between the two parties, this spelled eternal deadlock, so a casting vote was given to the new stadtholder, William Louis, who was appointed by the States-General, in this instance.In later years, Groningen, like the other provinces would itself appoint its stadtholder. The fall of Groningen also rendered Drenthe secure and this area was constituted as a separate province (as annexation by either Friesland or Groningen was unacceptable to the other party) with its own States and stadtholder (again William Louis), though Holland blocked its getting a vote in the States-General.Israel (1995), pp. 246–50 The Battle of Turnhout in 1597 =Dutch offensive of 1597= The fall of Groningen also changed the balance of forces in the German county of East Friesland, where the Lutheran Count of East Frisia, Edzard II, was opposed by the Calvinist forces in Emden. The States-General now laid a garrison in Emden, forcing the Count to recognise them diplomatically in the Treaty of Delfzijl of 1595. This also gave the Republic a strategic interest in the Ems River valley. After the death of Archduke Ernst in 1595, Archduke Albert was sent to Brussels to succeed his elder brother as Governor General of the Habsburg Netherlands. He made his entry in Brussels on 11 February 1596. His first priority was restoring Spain's military position in the Low Countries. During his first campaign season, Albert surprised his enemies by capturing Calais and nearby Ardres from the French and Hulst from the Dutch. These successes were however offset by the third bankruptcy of the Spanish crown later that year. The successful attack on Cadiz by an Anglo-Dutch task force was the main cause of this. This meant that payments to the army dried up and led to mutinies and desertions.Pedro de Abreu: Historia del saqueo de Cádiz por los ingleses en 1596, escrita poco después del suceso, fue vetada en su época por las críticas vertidas contra la defensa española. Se publicaría por vez primera en 1866. As a consequence, 1597 was marked by a series of military disasters. Albert's Spanish army of 4,600 attempted to surprise Tholen but Maurice's Anglo-Dutch army beat them to it and defeated them at Turnhout in a rare pitched battle in January.Markham pp. 254–55 Maurice then went on the offensive seized the fortress of Rheinberg, a strategic Rhine crossing, and subsequently Groenlo, Oldenzaal and Enschede fell into his hands. He then crossed into Germany and captured Lingen, and the county of the same name. This reinforced Dutch hegemony in the Ems valley. Capture of these cities secured for a while the dominance of the Dutch over eastern Overijssel and Gelderland, which had hitherto been firmly in Spanish hands.Israel (1995), p. 253 =Rise of Philip III and attacks on Dutch shipping= Dutch ships ramming Spanish galleys in the Battle of the Narrow Seas, October 1602 Meanwhile, however, the civil war in France was drawing to a close. The Dutch viewed this with some trepidation, because though Henry IV was the winner, the end of hostilities after the Peace of Vervins of May 1598 would free the Army of Flanders again for operations in the Netherlands. Soon after, Philip died, and his Will provided a new surprise. It turned out that he had willed the Netherlands to his daughter Isabella and her husband Archduke Albert, who would henceforth reign as co-sovereigns. This sovereignty was largely nominal as the Army of Flanders was to remain in the Netherlands, largely paid for by the new king of Spain, Philip III. Nevertheless, ceding the Netherlands made it theoretically easier to pursue a compromise peace, as both the Archdukes, and the chief minister of the new king, the duke of Lerma were less inflexible toward the Republic than Philip II had been. Soon secret negotiations were started which, however, proved abortive because Spain insisted on two points that were nonnegotiable to the Dutch: recognition of the sovereignty of the Archdukes (though they were ready to accept Maurice as their stadtholder in the Dutch provinces) and freedom of worship for Catholics in the north. The Republic was too insecure internally (the loyalty of the recently conquered areas being in doubt) to accede on the latter point, while the first point would have invalidated the entire Revolt. The war therefore continued.Israel (1995), pp. 253–257 However, peace with France and the secret peace negotiations had temporarily slackened Spain's resolve to pay its troops adequately and this had occasioned the usual widespread mutinies. A Spanish strike into Holland was attempted in April 1599 – Francisco de Mendoza, the Admiral of Aragon was ordered by the Archduke of Austria to mount an offensive into the Bommelerwaard. Once this has been taken the Spanish would then be able to cut Holland off and gain more favourable talks in the peace process. The offensive however went awry from the start. Mendoza with 12,000 horse and foot tried to go through to Zaltbommel by taking Schenkenschanz on 28 April, but was repelled by the small English garrison. The Spanish moved around the fort however and took Fort Crevecour and constructed Fort Sint-Andries near Heerewaarden. A siege on the town of Zaltbommel by Spanish troops was attempted but they had to lift the siege by the approaching Anglo-Dutch force of 10,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry led by Maurice of Nassau. The Spanish were defeated in subsequent attempts to regain the initiative. Mendoza retreated and the Spanish army then found itself in chaos: mutinies, desertions and sickness took effect.Duerloo p 118 Maurice took advantage of the wide spread insurrection – first he retook Wachtendonk and from there launched a campaign in the surrounding area to retake the only remnants of Spanish forces in the area, at forts Crevecoeur and San Andreas. Fort Crevecoeur gave in easily after Maurice offered them money on the account of the garrisons mutiny. Fort San Andreas was next – the garrison had mutinied against their officers but regarded the fort as their only pledge for the payment of their arrears. After a brief siege and a failure by a Spanish relief force led by Luis de Velasco to get to them in time, San Andreas was thus duly delivered into Dutch hands. Battle of Nieuwpoort, by Sebastiaen Vrancx The Army of Flanders now temporarily in disarray, Oldenbarnevelt and the civilians in the States-General spied a strategic opportunity to deal the Archdukes a heavy blow. They forced a deep strike into Flanders on a reluctant Maurice in the direction of the port of Dunkirk that had grown into a hotbed of privateers that did much damage to Dutch shipping. Maurice now flung his model army into Flanders after a large amphibious operation from Flushing and started his advance along the coast. This incursion brought an immediate end to the \\"industrial action\\" of the Spanish troops, enabling Albert to launch a strike into Maurice's flank. Somewhat hindered by all seven members of the States-General, who tried to micro-manage the campaign as deputies-in-the- field, Maurice was now cornered by Albert near the port of Nieuwpoort and forced to give battle on 2 July 1600. This was a test by fire of the Dutch army and the new tactics developed by the stadtholders against the still- formidable Spanish infantry and Maurice was none too sure about its outcome. However, the new tactics of volley-fire and artillery-supported infantry fighting got the better of the Spanish pikemen and Maurice personally routed the Spaniards in a cavalry charge.Thanks mainly to its easily memorable date, this battle is one of the few most Dutchmen are able to recite. Together with Turnhout this was one of the few pitched battles the States Army was able to win. However, remember who won the war: Jemmingen, Jodoigne and Gembloux never seemed to afford Spain a decisive advantage. It was a close-run thing, however, and strategically worthless, as Maurice retreated post-haste to the safety of Zeeland. To add insult to injury, a privateer fleet managed to break the blockade of Dunkirk and wreaked havoc on the Dutch herring fleet soon, destroying 10% of the fleet of Dutch Herring Busses in August.Israel (1995), pp. 258–9 =Raid on Southern Chile= The Dutch–Spanish war also reached South America. In 1600, local Huilliche (a Mapuche subgroup) joined the Dutch corsair Baltazar de Cordes to attack the Spanish settlement of Castro in Chile. While this was an isolated attack, the Spanish believed the Dutch could attempt to ally with the Mapuches and establish a stronghold in southern Chile.Clark 2006, p. 13. The Spanish knew of the Dutch plans to establish themselves at the ruins of Valdivia so they attempted to re-establish Spanish rule there before the Dutch arrived again.Bengoa 2003, pp. 450–451. The Spanish attempts were thwarted in the 1630s when Mapuches did not allow the Spanish to pass through their territory. =Stalemate, fortress building and truce= Maurice of Orange during the Battle of Nieuwpoort, 1600 The Archdukes decided that before taking on the Republic it was important to subdue the last Protestant enclave on the Flemish coast, the port of Ostend. The siege took three years and eighty days. Meanwhile, the stadtholders mopped up some more Spanish fortresses; Rheinberg capitulated in 1601, the following year in Brabant Grave fell and Sluys and Aardenburg were taken in what was to become States Flanders. Though these victories deprived the Archdukes of much of the propaganda value of their own victory at Ostend, the loss of the city was a severe blow to the Republic, and it brought about another Protestant exodus to the North.Israel (1995), p. 260 The supreme command of the Army of Flanders had now been transferred to Ambrosio Spinola who proved to be a worthy opponent of Maurice. In a brilliant campaign in 1605 he first outwitted Maurice by feigning an attack on Sluys, leaving Maurice far in his rear while he actually attacked the eastern Netherlands by way of Münster, Germany. He soon appeared before Oldenzaal (only recently captured by Maurice) and the predominantly Catholic city opened its gates without firing a shot. Next he captured Lingen. With both towns in Spanish hands the Dutch had to evacuate Twenthe and retire to the IJssel river. War picture from the struggle of the Dutch against Spain, probably the siege of Ostend Spinola returned the next year and caused a panic in the Republic when he invaded the Zutphen quarter of Gelderland, showing that the interior of the Republic was still vulnerable to Spanish attack. However, Spinola was satisfied with the psychological effect of his incursion and did not press the attack. Maurice decided on a rare autumn campaign in an attempt to close the apparent gap in the Republic's eastern defences. He retook Lochem, but his siege of Oldenzaal failed in November 1606. This was the last major campaign on both sides before the Truce that was concluded in 1609. Aftermath The strategic result of the Spanish gains of 1605–06 was that the Twenthe and Zutphen quarters were to remain a kind of No man's land until 1633, during which they were forced to pay tribute to the Spanish forces that often roamed there at will.Israel (1995), pp. 261–2 Nevertheless, in Spain the truce was seen as a major humiliation. The Dutch had more gains than Spain which saw very little if any in return. There was the virtual recognition of Dutch independence but also the closure of the river Scheldt to traffic in and out of Antwerp, and the acceptance of Dutch commercial operations in the Spanish and Portuguese colonial maritime lanes. Both sides now embarked on an intensification of the fortress-building spree that had begun in the mid-1590s, enveloping the Republic in a double belt of fortresses on its outer borders (an outer Spanish and an inner Dutch belt). This belt ran from Emden in the northeast via Bourtange, Coevorden, Zwolle, the line of the IJssel, with Deventer and Zutphen; to Arnhem and Nijmegen, and then west, along the Meuse to Grave, Heusden and Geertruidenberg; and finally south along the line through Bergen op Zoom to Lillo, north of Antwerp, and west again to the coast at Cadzand via Sluys.Israel (1995), p. 263, map The Dutch fortresses, mostly outside the provinces of the Union of Utrecht proper, were garrisoned with mercenary troops that, though paid for the account of individual provinces, were under federal command since 1594. The Dutch Staatse leger (States Army) had therefore become a truly federal army, consisting mostly of Scottish, English, German and Swiss mercenaries, but commanded by a Dutch officer corps. This standing army almost trebled in size to 50,000 between 1588 and 1607.Israel (1995), pp. 263–7; Glete, p. 155 Notes and references =Notes= =References= Sources Gelderen, M. van (2002), The Political Thought of the Dutch Revolt 1555–1590, Cambridge University Press, * Glete, J.

Lau has worked in the fashion industry since 1962 until his retirement in 1999, but he has never left his profession up to now. He was at the peak of his career in the 1980s, when he designed haute couture and stage costumes for the celebrities, such as Eunice Lam(林燕妮), Bak Sheut-sin (白雪仙), Liza Wang (汪明荃), Michelle Yeoh (楊紫瓊), Anita Mui (梅艷芳). Lau was also employed to design uniforms for international brands – Cathay Pacific (1999, 2011), Cathay Dragon (2013) and gained much recognition. He is the first fashion designer whose works have become a focus of the Hong Kong Heritage Museum's collection In 2013, the Hong Kong Heritage Museum held an exhibition of Lau, named '他Fashion傳奇Eddie Lau‧她Image百變‧劉培基' and his autobiography Clair de Lune (《舉頭望明月．劉培基自傳》) was released in the same year. Early life and education Lau was born in Hong Kong. He has never seen his father, while his mother was Pansy Cheung (孟君), a reputable author. When he was eight years old, he was sent to a boarding school in Fanling. However, his mother did not pay any of his tuition fees. At the age of 11, Lau started out as an apprentice under a Shanghai tailor, Hai Hung-fat, in Tsim Sha Tsui. During this period, Lau learned the craftsmanship which became particularly useful throughout his career. Also, the experience gained from the apprenticeship inspired the three elements that were emphasized in his future designs – silhouette, simplicity and elegance. In 1973, after he had saved enough money, Lau left Hong Kong for his further education on fashion design in a renowned fashion design institute – Central Saint Martins in London. According to Elle Magazine (199edition of August 1), Lau 'was enlightened by the freedom and artistic environment there and began to understand better what fashion design really was'. Career Lau was invited to hold an exhibition in the Hong Kong Heritage Museum in 2013 In fact, before Lau went to London for his further study, he established his own workshop in a rented room in Mirador Mansion at the age of 16. Since then, Lau began his personal lifelong business in the fashion industry. After finishing his 2-year study in London, Lau returned to Hong Kong with his first collection. Soon in 1977, Lau was invited to parade his fashion collection for the grand finale in the Ready-to-wear Festival, which was organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. In the same year, he headed back to London to hold his fashion show, and also flew to different countries afterwards to showcase his collections. Later on, Lau launched his own lines:‘EDDIE LAU’and‘KAI’(姫). He also founded his own fashion boutiques with his own brand 'EDDIE LAU' in Hong Kong and Japan, and collaborated with Chinese Arts and Crafts (H.K.) Ltd. to create several fashion collections. With these notable accomplishments, Lau became the first-ever Hong Kong designer to own an individual workshop and boutique. In the 1980s, apart from fashion design and haute couture, Lau began his work in image design and stage costumes for pop stars, and the most iconic artist is Anita Mui (梅艷芳), who dressed up in Lau's garments for almost every occasion and won the title of'Ever Changing Anita Mui'(百變梅艷芳). In 1999, Lau completed a project for Cathay Pacific – designing the flight attendant uniforms. He used 'The Heart of Asia' as his inspiration, and the design received a myriad of positive responses from the public. He retired after he had finished the project. However, after Lau's retirement, his passion towards fashion remains, and he is still keen on contributing to the industry. Lau renewed Cathay Pacific uniform designs in 2004 and designed the new uniforms for Cathay Pacific and Dragonair respectively in 2011 and 2013.

He is the CEO and co-founder of the IEX, the Investors Exchange. He left RBC in 2012 to co-found IEX under the premise that it would be a fairer stock trading venue than other exchanges. Through his work with IEX, Katsuyama is featured in Flash Boys, a 2014 non-fiction book by Michael Lewis about high-frequency trading (HFT) in the financial markets. Early life and education Born in 1978, Katsuyama is a native of Markham, Ontario, Canada. He is a graduate of Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, where he attended Lazaridis School of Business and Economics. Career =RBC and pre-IEX career= Before founding IEX, Katsuyama worked for many years at the Royal Bank of Canada. He held management roles in US cash equity trading, hedge fund coverage and US technology trading. Later he became the global head of electronic sales and trading, overseeing electronic sales, electronic trading, algorithmic trading, market structure strategy, client implementation and product management. =HFT problems, discovery and response= While at RBC, he noticed that placing a single large order that can be fulfilled only through many different stock exchanges was being taken advantage of by stock scalpers. Scalpers, noticing the order would not be able to be fulfilled by one single exchange, would instead buy the securities on the other exchanges, so that by the time the rest of the large order arrived to those exchanges the scalpers could sell the securities at a higher price. All these events would happen in milliseconds not perceivable to humans but perceivable to computers. Katsuyama led a team that implemented THOR, a securities' order-management system where large orders are split into many different sub-orders with each sub-order arriving at the same time to all the exchanges through the use of intentional delays. =Post-RBC and IEX founding= Katsuyama left RBC in 2012 to start what he considered to be a fairer stock trading venue, the Investors Exchange IEX. IEX is an emerging stock exchange, organized as an alternative trading system, also known as a dark pool; company representatives have stated their intention to convert to a public exchange upon reaching sufficient trading volume. It opened for its first day of trading on October 25, 2013. William O'Brien, at the time president of competing business BATS Global Markets, during a debate on CNBC, asserted in April 2014 the IEX was trying to build its business by generating 'fear', 'mistrust' and 'accusations'. Katsuyama and his work at IEX is featured in Flash Boys, a 2014 non-fiction book by financial writer Michael Lewis about high-frequency trading (HFT) in the financial markets. Lewis praised IEX as an appropriate and beneficial response to HFT abuses. Since the publishing of Flash Boys and the opening of IEX, several U.S. authorities have confirmed they are looking into certain practices used by high-frequency traders. The FBI, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Justice Department and the Attorney General of New York State all have investigations underway. =IEX approvals= The SEC approved the IEX to be an official exchange on June 17, 2016, with Katsuyama remaining IEX CEO. On October 24, 2017, IEX Group Inc. received regulatory approval from the SEC to list companies. IEX said it would begin listings in early 2018, with a focus on getting companies to switch over from other stock exchanges, by undercutting listing fees of rivals. Katsuyama remains chairman of the IEX board. Personal life Katsuyama lives in New York with his wife Ashley and his two sons, Brandon and Rylan.

He became a whistleblower in July 2011, when he filed a qui tam suit saying he was fired from USIS, for not ordering his subordinates to submit cases to the U.S. Government for payment, that had not been completed. He had worked for USIS from January 2001 to June 2011. In his suit he stated he had been fired after he refused to order his employees to continue an elaborate fraud known as dumping. The suit was filed under seal in U.S. District Court in Montgomery, Alabama. His allegations were investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and in October 2013 the DOJ joined Percival’s suit and removed the seal. The case, United States of America ex rel. Blake Percival v. U.S. Investigations Services, Civil Action No. 11-CV-527-WKW, was filed in U.S. District Court, Middle District of Alabama (Northern Division). On January 22, 2014 the DOJ filed their formal complaint against USIS. In their filing the DOJ stated that USIS committed fraud on at least 665,000 background investigations. This case was moved to Washington, D.C. on April 25, 2014. The case was settled on August 19. 2015 when USIS agreed to forgo claims to more than $30,000,000 it was owed by the U.S. Government. On December 18, 2015 the Department of Justice awarded Percival 20%, just over $6,000,000, of the money recovered from USIS. Education Percival graduated from Bluefield State College in January 2000 with a Regeants Bachelor of Arts Degree. He graduated from the West Virginia State Police Academy in April 1994 as part of the 86th Basic Class, which certified him as a Police Officer in West Virginia. He graduated from the Montgomery Police Academy’s lateral training class in 1998, which certified him as a Police Officer in Alabama.

Life and career Pao-Lu Hsu was born in Beijing on September 1, 1910, with his ancestral home in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. He was from a prominent intellectual family. In his childhood, he received solid training in both traditional Chinese and modern western cultures. He graduated from Tsinghua University in 1933, majoring in mathematics. After his graduation, he worked at Peking University as a teacher. In the meantime, he published a joint paper with Tsai-han Kiang (Jiang Zehan) on the numbers of nondegenerate critical points, which showed his solid mathematical foundation and research capability. In 1936, he went to University College London and spend four years studying mathematical statistics. During this period, with his strong mathematical skill combining with advanced statistical ideas, he wrote a series remarkable papers. He earned his Ph.D. in 1938 and Sc.D. in 1940. From London, he returned to China, accepting a professorship in the Department of Mathematics, Peking University. Nevertheless, the ensuing years were a period of great difficulty and hardship for him. During the years 1943-44, he corresponded with Jerzy Neyman (who was by this time at Berkeley) about statistics-related matters, but also mentioning in these letters the great hardship he was suffering, particularly starvation. In 1945, he went to the United States, visiting the University of California at Berkeley, Columbia University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1947, he returned to Beijing and thereafter he was engaged in teaching mathematics at Peking University for more than 20 years. Unfortunately, poor health had dogged Hsu from 1950 onward. Although many concerned about his health repeatedly suggested he go abroad to recuperate, he politely refused, insisting on teaching and continuing his research work. In 1956, Dr. Hsu was made Director of the first research institute for probability and statistics to be established in China. But his health continued to worsen, forcing him to work at home, which included giving lectures at his home to graduate students and young teachers using a blackboard hanging on a wall of his room. A month before his death in 1970 his manuscript on the relationship between experimental design and algebraic coding theory was completed, with such being his final legacy. Hsu died in his home on the campus of Peking University on December 18, 1970, from chronic tuberculosis. Found beside his bed the day after his death were piles of manuscripts that \\"serve as a testimony to the super-human fortitude with which he exerted himself for a period of more than 20 years...\\" In total, he had published more than 40 papers. There was a memorial meeting and Pao-Lu Hsu AwardPao-Lu Hsu Award in his honor.Hsu biography http://www-groups.dcs.st- and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Hsu.htmlAnderson, T. W., Chung, K. L., & Lehmann, E. L. (1979). Pao-Lu Hsu 1909–1970. The Annals of Statistics, 467–470. Hsu is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) and Academician of the Academy of Science of China. Memorial meetings were held in 1980, 1990, 2000 & 2010 at Peking University. Professor Hsu's main research areas were mathematical statistics and probability theory. He was an expert in operating matrix, manipulating characteristic functions and integral transformation. Hsu was a world-class statistician and is considered to be the founder of probability and statistics in China. He influenced many students such as Theodore Wilbur Anderson, Erich Leo Lehmann, and Chung Kai-lai. Hsu's work in statistics In 1938, Hsu's first two statistical papers, which appeared in Vol. II of the Neyman–Pearson edited Statistical Research Memoirs, were concerned with Behrens–Fisher problemHsu, P. L. (1938). \\"Contribution to the theory of 'Student's' t-test as applied to the problem of two samples.\\" Statistical Research Memoirs. and the optimal estimate of σ2 in the Gauss–Markov model.Hsu, P. (1938). \\"On the best unbiased quadratic estimate of the variance.\\" Statistical Research Memoirs, 2, 91–104. The most important paper in this series isHsu, P. (1941). Analysis of variance from the power function standpoint. Biometrika, 32(1), 62–69. where Hsu obtains the first optimum property for the likelihood ratio test of the univariate linear hypothesis, in fact essentially the first nonlocal optimum property for any hypothesis specifying the value of more than one parameter. From 1938 to 1945, Hsu published several papers in the forefront of the development of the theory of multivariate analysis. He obtained several exact or asymptotic distributions of important statistics in the theory of multivariate analysis.Academic Achievements of Professor P.L. Hsu Lehmann, E. L. (1979). Hsu's work on inference. The Annals of Statistics, 471–473. Hsu's work in probability Hsu was an expert in manipulating characteristic functions. He used characteristic functions as a tool to obtain distribution of certain random variables, to determine the limiting distribution of series of random variables. For one example, the Hsu–Robbins–Erdős theorem.Hsu, P. L., & Robbins, H. (1947). Complete convergence and the law of large numbers. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 33(2), 25.Erdos, P. (1949). On a theorem of Hsu and Robbins. The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 286–291. For another example, around 1940, a challenging problem was to find a solution of the most general form of the Central Limit Theorem, which drew the attention of many famed mathematicians, such as Levy, Feller, A. N. Kolmogorov, and Gnedenko. Hsu was a competitor and the competition showed that he was also on the peak. PaperA general weak Limit theorem for independent distributions.(Appendix III in limit Theorems of Sums of Independent Random Variables by B. V. Gnedenko and A. N. Kolmogorov, translated by K. L. Chung, revised edition, Addison–Wesley 1968). was Professor Hsu's manuscript which Hsu mailed to Professor K. L. Chung in 1947. In this paper Hsu independently obtained the necessary and sufficient condition under which the row sums of a triangular array of infinitesimal random variables, independent in each row, converges in distribution to a given infinitely divisible distribution. Despite the fact that Gnedenko obtained the same result in 1944, Hsu's method is direct and has its own trait.Academic Achievements of Professor P.L. Hsu Chung, K. L. (1979).

His father was Moti Moroda Bekere. Upon the conquest of Leka Neqamte by Ethiopia under Menelik II, he submitted to Ethiopian rule, converting to Tewahedo Orthodox Christianity, taking the name Gebregziabher (Amharic for \\"Servant of God\\"), and was appointed the Shum, or governor, of the expanded Welega Province. He fought at the Battle of Adwa and was later awarded the title of Dejazmach.

She helped form the Somali Women Parliamentary Association the Transitional Federal Parliament of Somalia, which was succeeded by the Federal Parliament of Somalia. She serves as a Senior Program Officer at the National Democratic Institute. Personal life Ahmed was born in Somalia. After the start of the civil war in 1991, she and her family emigrated abroad. Ahmed lived for a period in India. She later studied in Kenya. In 2003, she returned to Somalia, traveling to the capital Mogadishu. Ahmed's visit there inspired her to devote her career to helping rebuild the country. Career Professionally, Ahmed initially worked with the United Nations Population Fund and Norwegian People's Aid. She later branched out, aiming to move beyond awareness-raising on key issues to finding sustainable political solutions for the Somali parliament. In 2009, during workshops organized by the National Democratic Institute (NDI), Ahmed in conjunction with other Somali women civil society representatives and MPs established the Somali Women Parliamentary Association (SOWPA). It was the first women's caucus in the Somali Transitional Federal Parliament. In 2010, Ahmed officially joined the NDI, where she assisted the Somali Transitional Federal Government's legislative strengthening program. The project provided training to women MPs in Somalia on parliamentary standards and protocols. It also brought together female parliamentarians and civil society representatives to advocate for women's issues. These collective efforts helped shape provisions within the new Federal Constitution, which was adopted in August 2012. Ahmed concurrently provided support for women political leaders to lobby for political representation. These efforts in turn culminated in a provision within Somalia's transitional roadmap process to reserve at least 30 percent of seats for women in the new Federal Parliament. Under the aegis of the NDI's Andi Parhamovich Fellowship, Ahmed in 2013 worked for three months in Washington, D.C.. She developed a program to equip women with the requisite leadership skills for participation in Somali politics and the post-conflict reconstruction process. Over the course of the fellowship, she also met with U.S. lawmakers and their staff, women's organizations, and the executive director of the Women Legislators of the Maryland General Assembly to learn effective strategies to improve cohesiveness between female MPs and civil society officials, including identifying areas of common concern and forming advocacy coalitions. Among these conferences was a keynote address by Ahmed in April 2013 at Marietta College's McDonough Leadership Center, as well as a speech the following month at the NDI's Madeleine K. Albright Grant Luncheon. In June 2013, Ahmed returned to her NDI Somalia office to begin implementing her program. She is developing a training manual for Somali women MPs on basic government functions and leadership skills. She also hopes to hold workshops for women, and is working on improving equitable access to legislative training opportunities. Awards In 2013, Ahmed was presented the Andi Parhamovich Fellowship. The annual award is given to a young woman from the NDI or its partner organizations in 65 different nations who strengthens democratic institutionalization in her respective country through advancing female participation in politics.

Hans Gratzer performed classic productions, contemporary drama and musical productions at the Schauspielhaus until 1986. 1987-1990 From 1987 until 1990, George Tabori (*1914 in Budapest; † 2007 in Berlin) installed his theatre group Der Kreis (\\"the Circle\\") in the theatre. 1991-2001 Hans Gratzer returned to the Schauspielhaus between 1991 and 2001 for a second spell as director. He tried to position the theatre as a first-class contemporary German-language theatre by hosting premiers and first performances. One of his greatest successes was in discovering the playwright Werner Schwab. In his final season, Gratzer, working alongside Martin Haselböck, produced only musical theatre from the theatre, while a completely new form of theatre, Der Schaufenster (\\"shop window\\"), was staged in the alleyway pub next door.Hannes Wurm: das Schauspielhaus Schaufenster.

The campaign Hunger auf Kunst und Kultur (\\"Hunger for Art and Culture\\") was initiated in 2003 with cooperation from the National Anti-Poverty Conference, with the aim of making the arts accessible to people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Kosky departed in 2005 following creative differences with his co-director; Airan Berg led it until 2007 as an international coproduction stage. Theater für Alle (\\"Theatre for Everyone\\") started in 2005 through cooperation between the Schauspielhaus and the University of Vienna (Faculty of Education); this was a project aiming to open up theatre to the blind and partially-sighted through the use of trained cultural assistants.Elisabeth Scheicher: „Theater für Alle“.

In 1837 there were the ruins of the castle of Coolreath near the southern shore of Lough O’Grady and a ruined castle at Ballynahince.

It stars Darci Kistler, Damian Woetzel, Kyra Nichols, Bart Robinson Cook, Macaulay Culkin, Jessica Lynn Cohen, Wendy Whelan, Margaret Tracey, Gen Horiuchi, Tom Gold and the New York City Ballet. The film was released by Warner Bros. under their Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label on November 24, 1993, four days after director Ardolino died. It received mixed reviews and grossed $2,119,994. Plot The film follows the traditional plot of the Nutcracker. = Act I = Scene 1: The Stahlbaum Home Konstantin Ivanov's original sketch for the set of The Nutcracker (1892) It is Christmas Eve. Family and friends have gathered in the parlor to decorate the beautiful Christmas tree in preparation for the party. Once it is finished, the children are sent for. They stare in awe at it sparkling with candles and decorations. The party begins. A march is played. Presents are given out to the children. Suddenly, as the owl-topped grandmother clock strikes eight, a mysterious figure enters the room. It is Herr Drosselmeyer, a local councilman, magician, and Clara's godfather. He is also a talented toymaker who has brought gifts for the children, including four lifelike dolls who dance to the delight of all. He then has them put away for safekeeping. Clara and her brother, Fritz, are sad to see the dolls being taken away, but Drosselmeyer has yet another toy for them: a wooden nutcracker carved in the shape of a little man. The other children ignore it, but Clara immediately takes a liking to it. Fritz, however, breaks it, and she is heartbroken. During the night, after everyone else has gone to bed, Clara returns to the parlor to check on her beloved nutcracker. As she reaches the little bed she put it on, the clock strikes midnight and she looks up to see Drosselmeyer perched atop it. Suddenly, mice begin to fill the room and the Christmas tree begins to grow to dizzying heights. The nutcracker also grows to life size. Clara finds herself in the midst of a battle between an army of gingerbread soldiers and the mice, led by their king. They begin to eat the soldiers. The nutcracker appears to lead the soldiers, who are joined by tin soldiers, and dolls who serve as doctors to carry away the wounded. As the Mouse King advances on the still-wounded nutcracker, Clara throws her slipper at him, distracting him long enough for the nutcracker to stab him. Scene 2: A Pine Forest The mice retreat and the nutcracker is transformed into a handsome Prince. He leads Clara through the moonlit night to a pine forest in which the snowflakes come to life and dance around them, beckoning them on to his kingdom as the first act ends.

The film was criticized by James Berardinelli for not capturing the excitement of a live performance; he wrote that it \\"opts to present a relatively mundane version of the stage production...utilizing almost none of the advantages offered by the (film) medium.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was mixed on it, and gave it 2 out of 4 stars criticizing it for not adapting the dance for a film audience and also its casting of Culkin who, he writes, \\"seems peripheral to all of the action, sort of like a celebrity guest or visiting royalty, nodding benevolently from the corners of shots.\\" In The Washington Post, Lucy Linfield echoed Ebert's criticism of Culkin, stating that \\"it's not so much that he can't act or dance; more important, the kid seems to have forgotten how to smile...all little Mac can muster is a surly grimace.\\" She praised the dancing, however, as \\"strong, fresh and in perfect sync\\" and Kistler's Sugar Plum Fairy as \\"the Balanchinean ideal of a romantic, seemingly fragile beauty combined with a technique of almost startling strength, speed and knifelike precision.\\" The New York Times' Stephen Holden also criticized Culkin, calling his performance the film's \\"only serious flaw\\", but praised the cinematography as \\"very scrupulous in the way it establishes a mood of participatory excitement, then draws back far enough so that the classic ballet sequences choreographed by Balanchine and staged by Peter Martins can be seen in their full glory.\\" =Box office= During its theatrical run the film grossed $2,119,994.

Fitzpatrick's central argument is that academia should embrace the possibilities of digital publishing, which will in turn change the culture of academic writing and publishing. Major Themes The book is divided into five chapters, not including the introduction and conclusion: Peer Review, Authorship, Texts, Preservation, and The University. =Toward a New Form of Peer Review= Fitzpatrick starts the book by deconstructing one of the most important steps in the academic publication process - peer review. Drawing on a wide-ranging history of and problems in the process of academic peer review, she argues that much of the peer review process is about credentialing rather than about encouraging good ideas. Digital technologies allow for a review process that is more in-line with promoting good ideas: \\"putting them on the digital table, welcoming diverse attitudes toward them, selecting, shaping and reconfiguring them “curatorially” in imaginative response to freely offered and serious opinions\\". Keeping this in mind, Fitzpatrick offers a new model for peer review - 'peer-to-peer review'. She uses MediaCommons as an example of a community-filtered web platform that can function as a site to comment on a draft of scholarly work. On such an online platform, authors can post a draft manuscript and invite comments from their peers or the public, or both. Planned Obsolescence itself was posted on MediaCommons Press as a draft and comments were invited from the general public. =Changing Conceptions of Authorship= With digital publishing, Fiztpatrick envisions a shift in the accepted conception of authorship from a solitary enterprise with a definite endpoint in the creation of the text to one of writing within a community as part of an ongoing process. This change is a result of the capabilities of word processing, which allows for the swift and simple revision of text, and the digital networking, which enables linking, reader commentary, and version control. By releasing text to be read and commented upon online authorship becomes ongoing, process-oriented work taking place in a community of interested readers. Another aspect of community or collective authorship that Fitzpatrick explores is related to remix culture. She proposes a possible model of scholarly writing that collects and compiles work in illuminating ways. To be viable, this would require institutional acknowledgement that this kind of work is as valuable as the traditional scholarly monograph, and also the participation of the scholarly community in a gift economy with their work. She suggests that scholars use a Creative Commons license for scholarly work to facilitate the use and reuse of material for the collective benefit of the community. Fitzpatrick acknowledges that online writing, and particularly the use of platforms that enable reader comments, will require authors to develop a different relationship to their work. They must be committed to supporting online discussions without dominating them, and they must accept that this will increase the amount of time that they must invest in their writing, both because online discussions require regular participation and because their duration is indeterminate. =New Textual Forms= For Fitzpatrick, blogs, hypertext, and databases suggest directions in which digital scholarly publishing might move. She sees early attempts at hypertext writing as ultimately about the thought process of the author rather than the reader, but locates a possible future in the use of databases as platforms to create works by pulling together writing and media elements to create “new forms of networked arguments driven by the juxtaposition of digital objects and their analysis.” Such texts might be multimodal, Fitzpatrick’s term for texts that do not simply include media objects but instead incorporate media into their analysis or use media as analysis. =The Social Roots of Technical Problems= Fitzpatrick continues to develop her ideas of the importance of community with an analysis of digital text preservation in which she proposes that current technical issues with digital text preservation will require social solutions. This proposal is based on Fitzpatrick’s reasoning that difficulties in the preservation of digital texts are not caused by any quality inherent to digital artifacts but, rather, stem from our understanding of digital products and our social practices concerning their use. It is often assumed that issues with digital preservation are due to the ephemeral quality of digital artifacts. Fitzpatrick points out that this is not entirely correct, illustrating that print text is by no means permanent and digital text is far more permanent than is commonly thought. The loss of access to digital texts or their interpretability, sometimes due to incompatibility between older media formats and newer platforms, is mistakenly perceived as the loss of digital texts themselves. Establishing this fact, Fitzpatrick argues that digital preservation efforts should not focus entirely on technical solutions to technical issues, but instead should concentrate on developing socially organized preservation systems. In addition to focusing on the development of preservation practices through community organization, Fitzpatrick argues that creators of digital artifacts must take steps to ensure the compatibility of their work with preservation efforts, stating: “…planning for the persistent availability of digital resources as part of the process of their creation will provide the greatest stability of the resources themselves at the least possible cost”. In addition to community cooperation and coordination, Fitzpatrick shows that the incorporation of open standards and built-in extensibility are crucial to the development of successful digital text preservation practices. Included in these practices are three key components: the development of standards for text markup, so that digital texts can be read across a variety of platforms; the inclusion of rich metadata, so that digital texts can be located reliably; and the preservation of access to digital texts themselves. To support her argument for social solutions, Fitzpatrick examines several successful projects concerned with the development of text markup, metadata, and access standards and practices (including TEI, DOI, and LOCKSS) and shows that each is based in the creation of a community organization that values openness and extensibility. =Rethinking and Repurposing for Sustainable Scholarly Publishing= At the heart of scholarly text production, preservation, and dissemination lies the university. In a time of unfavorable economic conditions, Fitzpatrick suggests that the university may continue to fulfill its role in these endeavors only by rethinking its mission and repurposing its operational units. While the university press may have originally functioned to disseminate the work of an institution’s faculty to the larger community, in recent years, the university press has become a market-driven entity that is separate from the academic core of the university. Though university presses typically do not turn a profit and must depend on university subsidies to operate, they are often expected to be financially self-sustaining and, driven by this expectation, function to fulfill a mission much different from that of the university. Fitzpatrick attributes the recent trend of shuttering university presses to shrinking university budgets and the unsustainable business models in which many presses are forced to operate. For Fitzpatrick, the key to establishing financially viable models for university presses and modes of scholarly publishing more generally is the reconceptualization of the university’s mission. Universities must recognize that their mission is, in addition to the production of knowledge, the communication of knowledge. Fitzpatrick conceptualizes scholarship as an ongoing conversation between scholars that can only continue if participants have the means to contribute to it. Publishing and disseminating information via the university press is one possible mode of communication. This reconceptualization of the university’s mission is part and parcel to the restructuring of its press’s functioning. If the university is reimagined as a center of communication, rather than principally as a credential-bestowing organization, its central mission becomes the production and dissemination of scholarly work. In this rethinking, the press has a future as the knowledge-disseminating organ of the university. For this to happen, the press must be integrated within the university and be provided sufficient funding so that its mission is not financially based but, rather, aligns with that of the university. Following this restructuring, Fitzpatrick suggests that the mission of the university may be further strengthened by creating new partnerships and modes of operation between the university library, the IT department, and the university press. As argued throughout the book, scholarly publishing in its current as well as future forms stands to benefit from various forms of cooperation and each of these units may contribute something unique to enhance the production of scholarly work. These new interactions may lead to roles for the library, the press, and IT as service units that provide guidance during and add value to the scholarly production process. Lastly, Fitzpatrick suggests that these shifting locations and roles of the university press may remove the financial concerns previously restricting their abilities to experiment with new modes of publishing, perhaps allowing presses to explore alternative, more sustainable and open publishing models, including open access publishing. Peer-review process Two years before publication Planned Obsolescence was openly peer-reviewed online at MediaCommons Press. The manuscript is still available for open discussion on the website. Putting up a draft manuscript of the book up for open public review and debate allowed Fitzpatrick to demonstrate one of the key points of the book - that scholars have a lot to gain from openly sharing their work on digital platforms, and that open debates should become a part of the publishing process itself. Reception Planned Obsolescence has been reviewed or discussed in a number of publications by a range of writers. Critics have written positively on Fitzpatrick's treatment of authorship. Houman Barekat in the Los Angeles Review of Books described Fitzpatrick's reluctance to understand authorship as an effect of technologies and processes of production as \\"a sobering antidote to the vulgar technological determinism that characterizes so much of the hype around the digital revolution.\\" Alex Halavais notes that Fitzpatrick \\"masterfully\\" threads history, questions, and practical implications of technologies for writers, while neither ignoring nor relying too heavily on the theoretical concept of \\"the death of the author\\". Fitzpatrick's exploration of academic peer review has received less favorable criticism. In particular, her critique of the traditional mores of academic publication, whereby texts are first reviewed by colleagues and only published if they meet certain criteria, lacks clear \\"requirements for a proposed alternative system\\". Fitzpatrick's outline of post-publication peer review, the suggested alternative to pre-publication peer review, has been met with mixed appraisal: One reviewer deemed her proposal \\"riddled with flaws\\", while another reviewer commended the public scholarship potential of such an open method. Planned Obsolescence has also been listed as required reading for courses on the digital humanities, new media, and/or interactive technology and pedagogy in institutions such as the University of Maryland, Emory University, the CUNY Graduate Center, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

It was her first novel. A British hardcover was published by Sidgwick & Jackson in 1953, with a paperback following from Compact Books in 1966. Italian translations appeared in 1956 and 1992; a German translation was issued in 1982. It was included in Spaced Out: Three Novels of Tomorrow, a 2008 NESFA Press omnibus compiling all Merril's novels (the other two written in collaboration with Cyril M. Kornbluth).

Merril began writing Shadow on the Hearth as a short story; \\"When it reached ten thousand words,\\" she remembered, \\"I began to understand that it wanted to be a novel.\\" Although she stopped working on the piece when it reached twice that length, needing to spend more time with her young daughter, Doubleday editor Walter I. Bradbury read the incomplete draft and bought the novel. Merril quit her editorial job at Bantam to complete it. When she completed it, Doubleday imposed its own title (avoiding any mention of nuclear war), revising the text to create a happier ending, and wrapping the novel in a nondescript dust jacket. \\"On the cover was an attractive young mother, obviously in great distress: it could have been a gothic novel\\", Merril later groused, \\"or basically anything\\".Judith Merril & Emily Pohl-Weary, Better to Have Loved: The Life of Judith Merril, Between The Lines, 2002, pp. 97-99. In 1954, the Motorola TV Theatre aired an adaptation of Shadow on the Hearth, retitled Atomic Attack. Reception New York Times reviewer Charles Poore described Shadow on the Hearth as \\"a rather chintzy account of what happened to a Westchester family when the atomic bombs began to burst through the American air\\", noting that Merril \\"concentrate[s] on the creation of believable leading characters\\" and concluding that the novel \\"is generally entertaining reading, even if . . . not always for the reasons intended by the author\\".\\"Books of the Times\\", The New York Times, June 15, 1950. Another Times reviewer, John Cournos, received the novel unfavorably, saying its story \\"seems more like a somewhat uncomfortable picnic than a manifestation of a catastrophe\\".\\"No Hiroshima\\", The New York Times Book Review, June 18, 1950 Genre reviewers viewed Merril's effort more favorably. Groff Conklin described Shadow on the Hearth as \\"a masterly example of sensitive and perceptive story- telling.\\"\\"Galaxy's Five Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, October 1950, p. 141. Boucher and McComas praised it as \\"a sensitively human novel, terrifying in its small-scale reflection of grand-scale catastrophe.\\"\\"Recommended Reading\\", F&SF;, December 1950, p. 104. P.

After the fall of the Sasanian Empire, they reappear under the Dabuyid dynasty. Etymology The word is the plural form of the word wuzurg (meaning ”big, great”), which is derived from the Old Persian word vazarka, which is in turn derived from the Proto-Indo-European word weǵ (meaning “to be strong, lively, awake”).  History  The Sarab-e Bahram relief of Bahram II surrounded by grandees, Kartir and Papak being on his left. The wuzurgan are first mentioned in the early Sasanian period and appear in Shapur I's inscription in Hajjiabad. They played an important and prominent role in Sasanian politics, and seem to have held much influence. High-ranking members of the wuzurgan were present at the coronation of the Sasanian kings. Every time there was a dispute about choosing a Sasanian king, the objective of the wuzurgan was to elect a Sasanian king. After the death of Hormizd II in 309, the wuzurgan elected the latter's son Shapur II, who at that time was still in his mother's womb, as the king of the Sasanian Empire. Shapur's death in 379 marked the start of a 125-year conflict between the wuzurgan and the Sasanian kings, who both struggled for power over Iran. During the reign of Yazdegerd I (), the wuzurgan were treated badly, and after the latter's death in 420, they expelled all his sons and elected his nephew Khosrow as the ruler of the Sasanian Empire. Nevertheless, they later made an agreement with Yazdegerd's son Bahram V, and recognized him as king of the Sasanian Empire. After Peroz I's disastrous campaign against the Hephthalites, which resulted in his death and the death of many of the wuzurgan, his brother Balash was elected by nobility as the king of the Sasanian Empire. However, in reality it was Sukhra, an Iranian nobleman from the House of Karen, who held power over the empire. Even the wuzurgan were under his control. Balash's reign eventually proved disastrous, and as a result he was replaced by Peroz's son Kavadh I. Kavadh I, during his reign, began worshiping Mazdakism, a modified version of Zoroastrianism with influences from Manichaeism. The wuzurgan responded by siding with the Zoroastrian clergy, and had him imprisoned in 496, replacing him with his brother Djamasp. Gushnaspdad, the kanarang of the Sasanian Empire, later urged the wuzurgan and other noble classes to execute Kavadh I, which they, however, refused to do. The grandson of Kavadh I, Hormizd IV, because of his bad treatment of the wuzurgan and other high-class noble families, was in 590 deposed by a coup under the two Ispahbudhan brothers Vistahm and Vinduyih, who made Hormizd's son Khosrow II the new ruler of the Sasanian Empire. However, the wuzurgan and other nobles later became displeased with Khosrow II, and in 628 had him deposed in favor of his son Kavadh II. After the death of Kavadh II, the wuzurgan elected the latter's son Ardashir III, who was only a mere child. During his reign, his minister Mah- Adhur Gushnasp, who was part of the wuzurgan class, in reality, controlled the Sasanian Empire. During the Arab conquest of Iran, a Sasanian general named Bahman Jadhuyih, who was the head of an army numbering 30,000 of the wuzurgan, defeated the Arabs at the Battle of the Bridge in 634. Nevertheless, the Arabs won several other victories against the Sasanian Empire, and by 651 had all of Iran under their control. The wuzurgan are later mentioned during the reign of the Dabuyid ruler Khurshid (), where they along with the local population of Tabaristan were oppressed by Khurshid's general Karin. After the fall of the Dabuyid dynasty in 760, the wuzurgan are no longer mentioned in any sources.

Whitworth came from a broken home. His father left his mother and moved to California before he was one year old. His mother had died shortly afterwards, so his maternal grandparents and one uncle were awarded guardianship. The family breakup had hit the young Whitworth hard, and he had trouble making friends in school. At the time of his arrest, a now- retired educator who had been one of Whitworth's teachers in elementary school noted he \\"seemed to struggle to find a place to belong\\". US Navy service In September 1956, at the age of 17, Whitworth joined the Naval Reserve at Fort Smith, Arkansas. He was advanced to storekeeper third class in June 1959. By the early 1960s, Whitworth left the Navy and was a student at Coalinga College, a community college in Coalinga which is now known as West Hills College Coalinga, and was planning to go on to study engineering at the University of California. However, deciding that this would take too long, he decided to re-join the navy and make it his permanent career. He went on active duty at Naval Air Station Alameda in September 1962. Whitworth used his first weekend pass from Alameda to go to Mendota to see his father for the first time since childhood. Whitworth was transferred to Naval Air Station Los Alamitos in January 1965 where he decided to convert from storekeeper to radioman. He graduated from radioman A school at United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge in 1966 and spent a year with Tactical Air Command squadron TACRon 12. He was advanced to radioman second class in April 1967 and returned to school at Naval Training Center San Diego. Upon completion of that training in February 1968 and a few more months of training in Washington, D.C. he was transferred to the communications relay ship . Whitworth was advanced to radioman first class in April 1969 and transferred to in August for the aircraft carrier's fifth combat deployment to Vietnam. Whitworth was then ordered to attend a satellite communications school at Naval Training Center San Diego, where he graduated and did well enough to be assigned a teaching position at the same school. While teaching, he reported to the director of the program, John Anthony Walker. Whitworth had gained a reputation for being dedicated to his Navy work, but others also noticed an overwhelming effort in him to try and fit in. This was also noticed by Walker, who sensed an easy mark in expanding his spy ring, and befriended Whitworth by offering to spend weekends together sailing. The boat, acquired with Soviet money from spying, was christened Dirty Old Man. Whitworth left San Diego in February 1973 to work at the communications center on Diego Garcia, which served as the primary communications relay facility for reconnaissance aircraft, surveillance satellites, and National Security Agency listening operations in and around the Indian Ocean. After receiving a commendation for his work on Diego Garcia in August 1973, he re-enlisted in November 1974 with the promise of training in satellite communications operations at the Army Communications Electronic School at Fort Monmouth. Whitworth returned to Diego Garcia as a satellite communications specialist in March 1975, where he was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal for his performance as the petty-officer-in-charge of the satellite communications division and technical control facility. During his final year on Diego Garcia, the Navy began construction of a secret satellite intelligence facility code-named Classic Wizard intended to eavesdrop on radar and communications signals of Soviet ships. In June 1976 Whitworth reported aboard the aircraft carrier where his responsibilities included operation and maintenance of all communications systems, including the Navy's new Gapfiller satellite communications, and supervision of use of the ship's cryptographic equipment. Whitworth left Constellation in 1978 and was assigned as the chief radioman and classified material systems custodian aboard the supply ship , the same ship upon which John Walker had served as communications officer after leaving Fleet Training Center San Diego in 1971. Whitworth was assigned to the telecommunications center at Naval Air Station Alameda from September 1979, and then to the fleet satellite communications station at Stockton, California, before returning to sea as a communications watch officer supervising cryptographic technicians aboard the aircraft carrier from October 1982 until retirement from the Navy a year later. Soviet spying activity Whitworth agreed to help John Walker in getting highly classified communications data in 1973; from then until his retirement in 1983, his work for the navy involved encrypted communications and required security clearance. At first, Walker told Whitworth that the information was going to Israel, which made espionage sound more palatable with an ally. However, after learning the recipient was the Soviet Union, their relationship became strained. Whitworth continued to provide the material, but felt Walker was being duped in only getting several thousand dollars a month for information that would have cost the USSR tens of millions of dollars to obtain had they used technical penetration, i.e. \\"bugs\\". Whitworth married for the first time in 1967 but his wife left him within a year. She committed suicide in 1974 but he did not learn this until around 1980. He married a second time in 1976, to a woman 15 years his junior, and was still married to her at the time of his arrest. Less than six months after he retired from the Navy, Whitworth seemed to try to get out of espionage. In early May 1984, he wrote to the FBI in San Francisco, using the pseudonym \\"Rus\\". He said that he had been spying for several years, passing secret cryptographic lists for military communications. He said that there were at least three other people in his spy ring and offered to cooperate with the authorities provided he received immunity. He wrote again in late May 1984, again asking for immunity and saying that the spy ring had been operating for more than 20 years. He seems to have changed his mind during that summer—his final letter, dated mid-August 1984, said that he thought \\"it would be best to give up on the idea of aiding in the termination of the espionage ring previously discussed\\". Whitworth's retirement was formalized by the Navy on October 31st, 1983. He then attended school to become a stockbroker, and had taken his stockbroker's exam in 1985. Shortly afterwards, Whitworth was arrested. While imprisoned, he was informed via mail that he was not to be awarded his stockbroker's license due to failure of the exam. Arrest, prosecution & imprisonment John Walker's former wife reported his spying to the FBI,John Prados, \\"The Navy's Biggest Betrayal\\", Naval History Magazine, 24(3), June 2010 in revenge for his failure to pay alimony. Shortly after Walker was arrested on 20 May 1985, Walker's son, Michael, and Walker's brother, Arthur, were arrested. Barbara Walker had never met Jerry Whitworth, and his role in the spy ring was tougher to uncover. Through Whitworth's 1984 letters to the FBI, John Walker's poorly- coded letters to the KGB which identified him as \\"D\\", and Barbara Walker remembering her ex-husband often mentioning a friend (though she could not recollect if his true name was \\"Wentworth\\" or \\"Whitworth\\"), the FBI was finally able to pinpoint Jerry Whitworth, and he was arrested on 3 June 1985. Walker entered into a plea bargain, agreeing to testify against Whitworth, apparently mainly in return for lenient treatment of his son. But Walker also received more lenient treatment than the man he had recruited—Walker would have been eligible for parole in May 2015 (he died on August 29, 2014 in prison), but Whitworth was sentenced to 365 years.

This assisted Bletchley Park to decipher several Enigma codes. In May 1941, Stuart-Menteth again assisted the capture of Enigma material from the German ship München, enabling Bletchley Park to begin to decipher German Enigma codes. Several months later, he was given command of his first ship, , a Hunt- class destroyer. Stuart-Menteth joined in March 1942, and helped sink the .

The episode was written by Dewayne Jones and directed by Liz Friedlander. Summary At Korban, Joe has a gathering with some Korban followers and asks for a volunteer. A woman, Angela, steps up and Joe reveals a woman, Carla, strapped to a table and instructs Angela to stab Carla, \\"sending her home.\\" Joe and Emma later discuss Mandy, as Emma feels she is a lost cause. Mandy listens to the conversation from outside of their door. Robert joins Joe and Emma and questions Joe about why he selected Carla to be killed, also informing him that Korban members are beginning to question Joe because they miss Micah and are aware of Joe's past. Robert apologizes for bringing the subject up in the first place after Joe calms his nerves. Emma follows Robert back to his room and tries to further ensure he has no doubts. She seduces him throughout the conversation and the two eventually hook up. Ryan watches a news report showing that a fan club for Joe has begun, not of violence but of admiration. Mike and Ryan research possible cult connections and information on Lily Gray while briefly discussing each other's personal lives. Meanwhile, Claire continues requesting to see Ryan. She is given a proposition, allowing her to see Ryan on the conditions that her son and mother are moved to an undisclosed location that she will not know unless she returns to witness protection. Two masked men enter a bakery and begin stabbing customers and employees at random before running out the back door. When Ryan and the FBI show up, Ryan notices that no message has been left at the crime scene like previous attacks sent by Joe. Later as a nurse, Terri Burke, is getting into her car, she is stabbed by a woman, Serena. Serena takes Terri's identification card and clothes to enter the hospital where the victims from the bakery attack are being treated. She drops off a bag into a locker in an employee room. Two men who were stabbed in the attack leave their hospital beds and retrieve the bag, revealing guns inside. Serena goes to see Luke and hands him a phone with Lily on the line. Lily tells Luke to follow all of Serena's instructions so that she can bring Luke home. A man, Decklan, wheels his partner on a gurney into the area where Luke is being kept, where they shoot security members dead. Serena leads Luke out of the room and Decklan takes him from there. The FBI shows up before they're able to escape. Mike checks IDs of a few hospital workers. Serena is in the group and hesitates to show her ID and tries to stab Mike, but is shot dead when she refuses to give information on Lily and again pulls a knife on Mike. Another of Lily's men is waiting in an ambulance for Decklan to bring Luke to, but the FBI corner the ambulance and shoot the driver dead. Ryan finds Luke and Decklan in a back room and Decklan pulls a gun to Ryan's head. Ryan escapes and shoots Decklan dead as Luke runs away and escapes through a market. Carrie shows up at the market to briefly meet up with Ryan. She then goes on air for the story about Lily's arranged attack and rescue mission, which Joe and Emma watch. Meanwhile, Mandy packs her bag and leaves Korban. She is picked up by a local cop and calls Mark, whose number she got online. Ryan assures Mike that they will find Lily and Joe and eventually live a normal life. The two return to Ryan's apartment and there is a knock at the door. Mike sees Claire and runs over to Ryan, saying he can explain everything. The door opens and Ryan stares at Claire in complete shock. Reception =Critical response= Sonia Saraiya of The A.V.

Furthermore, there was no evidence that Lepomäki had been enticed to the apartment in order to kill her. Joona Hasselqvist's sentence was lowered to 12 years in prison for manslaughter, and Joel Lilo's sentence was lowered to 6 years in prison for assisted manslaughter. The sentences differed, because the district court judge had sentenced both for murder. After the sentence had been declared, Lilo was released, because Finnish law grants parole for crimes committed under the age of 21 after one third of the sentence has been served.Jenna Lepomäen surmaajille lievemmät tuomiot hovista, MTV3 Uutiset 31 October 2013.

Lilo's parole caused disapproval among the public, because after being paroled, he disgraced Lepomäki's on-line memorial with indecent comments. Lepomäki's father reported this to the Finnish police, and Lilo was arrested for a few days suspected of dishonouring Lepomäki's memory.Joel Lilo vapautettiin, Ilta-Sanomat 21 November 2013.

According to Parliament of Finland member Kari Tolvanen, the Finnish criminal law should be changed in regards to first-time offenders, and he left a proposal of the matter. Minister of Interior Päivi Räsänen remarked that according to her, the notion of first-time offenders should be removed entirely in cases of serious crimes.

Sligo) in northwest Ireland. The exact date for the battle varies from 555 AD to 561 AD. 560 AD is regarded as the most likely by modern scholars. The battle is notable for being possibly one of the earliest conflicts over copyright in the world... Traditional accounts Traditional accounts ascribe different reasons for this battle. The most famous is the story about the copying of a book belonging to Saint Finnian by Columcille. According to tradition, sometime around 560, the Irish abbot and missionary Saint Columba became involved in a quarrel with Saint Finnian of Movilla Abbey over a psalter. Columba copied the manuscript at the scriptorium under Saint Finnian, intending to keep the copy. Saint Finnian disputed his right to keep the copy. Thus, this dispute was about the ownership of the copy (whether it belonged to Saint Columba because he copied it or whether it belonged to Saint Finnian because he owned the original). King Diarmait mac Cerbaill gave the judgement, \\"To every cow belongs her calf, therefore to every book belongs its copy.\\" Columba disagreed with King Diarmait's ruling against him and reportedly instigated a successful rebellion of the Uí Néill clan against the King. The battle was claimed to have caused around 3,000 casualties. Another traditional reason given for the battle concerns the violation of sanctuary. The Annals Of Tighernach for the year 559, record the death of Curnan son of Aed, son of Eochaid Tirmcharna by Diarmait mac Cerbaill, while Curnan was 'ar comairce Coluim chilli - under Colum Cille's protection'. This Curnan was the son of Aed, the king of Connacht. That Diarmait had violated the sanctuary of the termonn at the Columban monastery of Kells is given as the reason for the battle. Either way, as a monk who had taken up arms, Colmcille faced judgement for his deeds. It said that the judgement resulted in Columba leaving his homeland for Scotland, where he founded Iona Abbey in 563. The sentence stipulated he was to win as many souls to Christianity as had been lost in the battle. The Chronicles of Iona state that \\"In the second year after the battle of Cul-drebene, the forty-second year of his age, Columba sailed away from Ireland to Britain wishing to be a pilgrim for Christ.\\" Modern investigations However, these later versions have been disputed by modern scholarship on several grounds, https://www.jstor.org/stable/25509109?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents particularly as early mentions of the battle do not refer to the book incident. It may have been a dynastic battle between the Cinel Cairbre and Diarmait Mac cerbaill who had wrested the kingship at Tara from them after the death of Tuathal Maelgarb.

Data to be transmitted over a noisy channel may first be encoded using an SCCC. Upon reception, the coding may be used to remove any errors introduced during transmission. The decoding is performed by repeated decoding and [de]interleaving of the received symbols. SCCCs typically include an inner code, an outer code, and a linking interleaver. A distinguishing feature of SCCCs is the use of a recursive convolutional code as the inner code. The recursive inner code provides the 'interleaver gain' for the SCCC, which is the source of the excellent performance of these codes. The analysis of SCCCs was spawned in part by the earlier discovery of turbo codes in 1993. This analysis of SCCC's took place in the 1990s in a series of publications from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The research offered SCCC's as a form of turbo-like serial concatenated codes that 1) were iteratively ('turbo') decodable with reasonable complexity, and 2) gave error correction performance comparable with the turbo codes. Prior forms of serial concatenated codes typically did not use recursive inner codes. Additionally, the constituent codes used in prior forms of serial concatenated codes were generally too complex for reasonable soft-in-soft-out (SISO) decoding. SISO decoding is considered essential for turbo decoding. Serial concatenated convolutional codes have not found widespread commercial use, although they were proposed for communications standards such as DVB-S2. Nonetheless, the analysis of SCCCs has provided insight into the performance and bounds of all types of iterative decodable codes including turbo codes and LDPC codes. US patent 6,023,783 covers some forms of SCCCs. The patent expired on May 15, 2016.  History  Serial concatenated convolutional codes were first analyzed with a view toward turbo decoding in \\"Serial Concatenation of Interleaved Codes: Performance Analysis, Design, and Iterative Decoding\\" by S. Benedetto, D. Divsalar, G. Montorsi and F. Pollara.http://www.systems.caltech.edu/EE/Courses/EE127/EE127C/handout/serial.pdf This analysis yielded a set of observations for designing high performance, turbo decodable serial concatenated codes that resembled turbo codes. One of these observations was that \\"the use of a recursive convolutional inner encoder always yields an interleaver gain.\\" This is in contrast to the use of block codes or non-recursive convolutional codes, which do not provide comparable interleaver gain. Additional analysis of SCCCs was done in \\"Coding Theorems for 'Turbo-Like' Codes\\" by D. Divsalar, Hui Jin, and Robert J. McEliece. This paper analyzed repeat-accumulate (RA) codes which are the serial concatenation of an inner two-state recursive convolutional code (also called an 'accumulator' or parity-check code) with a simple repeat code as the outer code, with both codes linked by an interleaver. The performance of the RA codes is quite good considering the simplicity of the constituent codes themselves. SCCC codes were further analyzed in \\"Serial Turbo Trellis Coded Modulation with Rate-1 Inner Code\\".http://trs- new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/18647/1/99-2030.pdf In this paper SCCCs were designed for use with higher order modulation schemes. Excellent performing codes with inner and outer constituent convolutional codes of only two or four states were presented.  Example Encoder  Fig 1 is an example of a SCCC. Fig. 1. SCCC Encoder The example encoder is composed of a 16-state outer convolutional code and a 2-state inner convolutional code linked by an interleaver. The natural code rate of the configuration shown is 1/4, however, the inner and/or outer codes may be punctured to achieve higher code rates as needed. For example, an overall code rate of 1/2 may be achieved by puncturing the outer convolutional code to rate 3/4 and the inner convolutional code to rate 2/3. A recursive inner convolutional code is preferable for turbo decoding of the SCCC. The inner code may be punctured to a rate as high as 1/1 with reasonable performance.  Example Decoder  An example of an iterative SCCC decoder. Fig. 2. SCCC Decoder The SCCC decoder includes two soft-in-soft- out (SISO) decoders and an interleaver. While shown as separate units, the two SISO decoders may share all or part of their circuitry. The SISO decoding may be done is serial or parallel fashion, or some combination thereof. The SISO decoding is typically done using Maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoders using the BCJR algorithm.  Performance  SCCCs provide performance comparable to other iteratively decodable codes including turbo codes and LDPC codes. They are noted for having slightly worse performance at lower SNR environments (i.e. worse waterfall region), but slightly better performance at higher SNR environments (i.e. lower error floor).

It was announced on April 2, 2014 at Microsoft Build 2014 and was released in April 2014 as Nokia's (and later Microsoft Mobile's) flagship. It is the last high- end Nokia-branded Lumia device and succeeded by the Microsoft-branded Lumia 950 and its XL equivalent. The Nokia Lumia Icon, which is exclusive to Verizon Wireless in the United States, is essentially a derivative of the Lumia 930. The two versions share a common design and specifications; the only hardware difference is that the 930 is equipped with GSM radios and available as both carrier-locked and unlocked versions, while the Icon has both GSM and CDMA radios and is always sold unlocked. The other difference is that the 930 was originally pre-loaded with the newer Windows Phone 8.1 rather than the previous-generation Windows Phone 8 Update 3 on the Icon. Neither the 930 nor the Icon have the Glance feature, which displays the time and other selectable information on the display of an otherwise sleeping phone. While other contemporary Nokia smartphones have Glance, the 930 and Icon do not because their displays lack the necessary \\"display memory\\" feature.  Specifications  = Hardware = The Lumia 930 has a 5.0-inch AMOLED display, quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400 Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. The phone has a 2420 mAh Li-Ion battery, 20 MP rear camera and 1.2 MP front-facing camera. It is available in orange, green, white, black and gold. = Software = The Lumia 930 ships with Windows Phone 8.1.  Known issues  Some handsets experience heat and battery drain issues. Some handsets have had a display discoloration issue, when the device came out. A significant number of Lumia 930 users have reported an issue with the operation of the audio microphones, where handsfree calls and video recordings have very low audio levels. This has been confirmed to be caused by a motherboard fault. There have been a number of reports of this being a software issue introduced with Windows 10, though this is incorrect as the issue is also reported with Windows 8.1, including pre-Denim releases. A workaround for Lumia 930 users experiencing this issue is to use ear buds that have a microphone included when doing handsfree calls and video recordings.

Creating documentation of collections and providing safe storage conditions are important aspects of collections management. Collections management involves the development, storage, and preservation of collections and cultural heritage. The primary goal of collections management is to meet the needs of the individual collector or collecting institution's mission statement, while also ensuring the long-term safety and sustainability of the cultural objects within the collector's care. Collections management, which consists primarily of the administrative responsibilities associated with collection development, is closely related to collections care, which is the physical preservation of cultural heritage. The professions most influenced by collections management include collection managers, registrars, and archivists. Definition Cultural heritage collections require a great deal of care and protection in order to ensure their safety from external loss or damage, but they also require in-depth documentation to assist in tracking the life of the object within the holding institution. To accommodate these needs, collectors adhere to collections management and collections care standards and practices, which serve to create a safe environment for collection objects with clear and precise accompanying documentation. Where collections care addresses the physical actions necessary to prevent or delay damages of cultural heritage, collection management can be defined as \\"a process of information gathering, communication, coordination, policy formulation, evaluation, and planning.\\" These processes influence decisions about records management and the collections management policy, which outlines protocols for the collection scope, collections care, and emergency planning and response. Records management According to the Smithsonian Institution, a record is \\"any official, recorded information, regardless of medium or characteristics which are created, received, and maintained\\" by an individual collector or institution. As every object within a collection must have accompanying documentation, records management functions as the primary focus of collections management, and covers a wide range of documentation and policy standards. Topics covered under the umbrella of records management include collection information management systems, collections accession and deaccession policies, collection management policies, cataloging, and curation. The lack of appropriate record keeping systems in museums compromises the security of museum collections and threatens the role of museums as information centers. Planned and systematized management of records improves programs and activities in museums, thereby leading to effective governance and operation of the museum. =Collections management systems= Collection management systems (CMS) are software programs designed to aid in the archiving and cataloging of objects in a collection. Within libraries, archives, and museums. Although every CMS program is unique, there are several features that are considered standard: * Cataloging: This feature includes fields for object identification purposes such as permanent identification numbers, object name, artist or creator name, object description, dimensions, object components and materials, condition, provenance, exhibition and preservation history, current location, and an image of the object. * Acquisitions: This feature includes fields relevant to the donor and purchase history for the object such as date of acquisition, donor or seller name and contact information, the assigned accession number, purchase price, condition assessment at time of arrival, and seller or donor restrictions, if applicable. * Deaccessions: This feature addresses the removal of an object from a collection and includes information such as the date of deacessioning, method of disposal used, and reason for removal. * Loans: This feature is used for tracking information about incoming and outgoing loans to include lender name and contact information, special requirements, shipping instructions, associated insurance policies, and loan history. * Condition and conservation reports: This feature includes condition assessments performed on objects, and the name of the inspector and date of inspection. This section also includes conservation reports detailing conservation-restoration treatments performed on the object. * Security: This feature allows the database administrator to restrict access to the database by giving only specific individuals access to view and/or edit object records. * Copyright: The copyright feature allows the institution to input relevant intellectual property restrictions for the objects in order to prevent illegal distribution or reproduction of the object. * Multimedia: The multimedia feature is a function that allows digital materials such as image, video, and audio content associated with an object to be attached to the object record. This feature typically allows the input of associated metadata. =Cataloging= Cataloging is the process of entering informational data about an object into a collection catalog or database. This process involves assigning unique identification numbers to individual objects within a collection, and attaching relevant accompanying documentation to the item such as curatorial worksheets, photographs, condition assessments, and accession and/or deaccession information. A catalog is meant to serve as a systematic written or digital record of every object within a collection, and should at the very least, include an object description that will allow for easy identification of an object. Cataloging is an important aspect of collections management as it provides the individual records associated with each object within a collection. Should an object be lost or destroyed, the catalog entry can be utilized as a permanent record of the object and its data. For some collections, such as natural history collections, the catalog entry for an object or specimen also contains the scientific values and research information about the physical object, making maintenance of a catalog entry imperative for future research and education. Most modern collectors and institutions utilize CMS to streamline the catalog process. For this to be effective, data entry standards must be utilized for data structure, data values, and data content, which then \\"form the basis for a set of tools that can lead to good descriptive cataloguing, consistent documentation, shared records, and increased end-user access.\\" =Curation= Curation can be defined as the collecting, organizing, preserving, and displaying of information about a specific object or collection topic. The role of curating is performed by individuals known as curators, who, in many cases, are trained as subject specialists. Curators conduct research on objects, offer guidance in the organization of a collection, and select objects to be utilized in exhibitions. Curation involves the development and design of exhibitions, typically based on objects within the collection, as well as the in-depth research and writing of materials associated with the collection. Digital curation Digital curation is an extension of content curation, and involves the collecting, preserving, and archiving of digital assets associated with digitized collections. Digital assets include both those items that originated in a digital form and are considered born- digital (i.e. websites, wikis, and digitally created sound and photographs), as well as analog items that have been digitized (i.e. cataloged in digital form, while still maintaining the original physical/analog form). Digital curation, like content curation, also involves the development and design of exhibitions based on objects within the collection, which in this case, often involves website maintenance for online exhibits. Whether born-digital or digitized, many modern collections contain some form of digital collection content which must be maintained in much the same way as physical objects. Preservation of digital assets involves the creation of metadata to improve accessibility and object tracking, preventing technical obsolescence and data loss due to mismanagement, performing routine audits of technical software and digital catalogs to ensure data remains uncorrupted, applying authorization standards to protect data from unauthorized alterations, and managing content for the purposes of research and exhibition. Collections management policy The primary focus of collections management is to document the standards and practices necessary to develop, care for, and make available for use, the collection objects within a collector or institution's care. To accomplish this, a collections management policy is created in which detailed information is provided to explain the specific needs of the collection based on type, age, location, etc. Collection management policies are specific to the collection-holding institution and these policies lay out terms such as which personnel are responsible for individual tasks involving the collection, if and when an object should be acquired for or removed from the collection, who within the institution has access to the collection, and the preventive care needs of each object within the collection. =Legal and ethical considerations= In addition to general care standards, a collection management policy is also governed by the local and international legal restrictions placed on certain cultural heritage objects and the management needs associated with them. There are countless laws on the books that specify how antiquities, archaeological findings, and ethnic pieces must be handled and maintained to ensure their physical safety as well as the ethical considerations that these unique collection objects must address. Examples of local laws within the United States of America include: * Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities, June 8, 1906 (“The Antiquities Act”) (16 USC 431-433): authorizes the President of the United States to declare national monuments, and enforces regulations protecting archaeological sites and excavated objects. * Museum Properties Management Act of 1955, (16 USC, Sect. 18 [f]): explains the responsibilities and actions that may be performed by the United States Secretary of the Interior through the National Park Service to include accepting donations and bequests of money, purchasing museum objects and collections, making exchanges of museum objects or collections, and accepting and making loans of museum objects or collections. * Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990(NAGPRA), (25 USC 3001-13): identifies ownership and control rights for Native American cultural items. Examples of international legislation include: * The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, (adopted 14 May 1954): an international treaty focused on protecting cultural heritage such as architectural monuments, archaeological locations, works of art, and any objects deemed to have artistic, historic, or scientific significance. * Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, (Paris, 14 November 1970): an international agreement to oppose the practices of illicit importing, exporting, and transferring of ownership of cultural property in order to better preserve the cultural property of the countries of the world. * Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, (Paris, 17 October 2003): an international agreement designed to safeguard intangible cultural heritage while also raising awareness and appreciation thereof. Intangible cultural heritage includes \\"the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage.\\" =Collection scope= Written as a subsection of the overarching collection management policy, most collectors and cultural institutions utilize a collections policy, or selection criteria policy, in which it is outlined what purpose the collection serves, and the types of objects that are considered most relevant. The collection policy lays out the scope of the collection and its relevance to the institution's mission statement by serving as \\"a broad description of the [institution's] collections and an explanation of how and what the museum collects and how those collections are used.\\" The scope of the collection as laid on it in this policy serves to define if, when, and how a cultural institution chooses to accession or deaccession objects from its collection. Additionally, as different types of collections require unique care protocols, the collection policy also details the categories associated with the collection such as library or archive, education or research, permanent, and exhibit. The collection policy might also address conflicts of interest for employees who hold personal collections that are similar to those of the institution within which they are employed. Accessioning Accessioning can be defined as \\"the process of creating a permanent record of an object, assemblage, or lot received from one source at one time for which the [institution] has custody, right, or title, and assigning a unique control number to said object, assembly, or lot.\\" As part of the collection scope policy, collectors and institutions must lay out acquisition terms to ensure only relevant objects are successfully accessioned into the collection. This portion of the policy discusses: who within the institution is authorized to make decisions on whether an object is acquired or not, under what legal terms the object is to be acquired (i.e. documentation proving legal purchase, import and export restrictions, and intellectual property rights), and repository agreement information if the object is to be stored within an offsite facility. The accessioning section of the collection policy might also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the collection by examining the history of the collection as a whole. This in turn allows the collector or institution to set guidelines for improving, growing, and developing the collection in a way that is of most benefit. Deaccessioning Deaccessioning is the opposite of accessioning and involves the permanent removal of an object and all associated records from a collector's or institution's collection. Like the accession portion of the collection policy, the deaccession section lays out the terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process. Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions associated with removal of the object, and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession. There are many reasons that an object may be removed from a collection including: * The object has been deemed no longer relevant to the collection-holder's mission or permanent collection scope. * The condition of the object has deteriorated or been damaged to such an extent that the collection-holder cannot implement restoration repairs, or the object now poses a health risk for institution personnel. * The institution no longer possess the means to maintain the object in an adequate environment due to financial or budgeting concerns, loss of personnel, lack of equipment, etc. * The institution already possesses similar objects within the collection, which causes an unnecessary redundancy. * The object has been deemed a fake or forgery, or not authentic and no longer relevant to the overall collection. * The collection-holder is in a position in which deaccessioning an object will improve the quality of care and function of the remaining collection. Loans and temporary custody of objects Collectors and collecting institutions sometimes transfer objects to or from their collections for temporary periods of time as part of loan or temporary custody agreements. These loans help share and disseminate information to different communities and can prove mutually beneficial to both collection-holding individuals or institutions. Loans can occur for a variety of reasons and for policy purposes loans may be defined as: stationary or traveling exhibition loans, exchange loans, study loans, promised gifts, fractional-interest gifts (a \\"donor's remaining interest in a partial gift\\"), and long-term loans. The policies for loans may also be applied to acquisitions during the processing period, unsolicited objects until a return can be arranged, and collection objects or those objects found, abandoned, or unclaimed, in which ownership is unclear. Within the collections scope section of a collections management policy, there is typically an area dedicated to discussing the procedures for loan approval and acceptance, associated acquisition fees, required documentation, specific insurance requirements, and monitoring instructions for the temporary holdings. This section may also include information about old loans and works with restrictions governing if and when they are allowed to leave the holding-institution. The loan policy should address both incoming and outgoing loans with thoroughly explained written procedures. =Collections care= The visual storage facilities at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England. Collections care can be defined as the physical preventive care measures taken to prevent damage or delay the natural deterioration of cultural heritage collection objects. These practices strive to provide enhanced safety for collections by minimizing damages from external sources such as improper handling, vandalism, climate changes, overexposure to light, and pests. A collections management policy carefully examines the collections care and collections maintenance (museum) needs of the individual objects within the collection, in order to provide practices and standards for how to mitigate threats, as well as the proper procedures for addressing issues as they arise. Sub-topics within this section may include display and storage housing, packing and transport, and integrated pest management. Display and storage housing When objects are held within a collection, either in storage or on display in an exhibit, the primary concern should be on the continued safety of the collection. To accomplish this, the collector or holding-institution must take into consideration proper housing containers, as well as environmental conditions necessary to prevent damages. The collections management policy for the collection should contain sections in which display and storage housing needs for the objects are addressed in full. Consultation with a conservator- restorer may be necessary to fully address these topics. In terms of housing, solid structural design is vital in ensuring objects remain undamaged while stationary. This includes accounting for padding and support of the objects to prevent damage from bumps and snags, and stable display cases or mounts, which often requires collaboration with a mount maker to ensure proper creation and installation. Stands, shelves, drawers, and cases, in addition to fasteners, adhesives, papers, and foams, must all be chosen based on their compatibility with the structural design and materials of each individual object. The collections management policy should outline housing specifications such as the use of acid-free (pH neutral) and dye-free materials; types of enclosed cabinetry where available; appropriate coverings such as fabrics (e.g. unbleached muslin), polyethylene sheeting, and closed-cell foam (e.g. Ethafoam); containers made of paper, plastic, wood, or metal; enclosures such as folders or mats; and standards for frames, supports, and mounts. The main environmental conditions that require outlined protocols in the collections management policy include temperature, relative humidity (RH), light, and contaminants. It is impossible to completely prevent natural deterioration of objects, but by carefully monitoring and implementing policies regarding environmental conditions, the effects of these conditions can be greatly reduced. * Temperature: There is some flexibility allowed when addressing temperature, as it is impossible to control external weather. However, policy standards should aim to set temperature ranges that are optimized for the type of objects being preserved, the collector's or institution's energy and financial restrictions, as well as human comfort levels within both exhibit galleries and storage facilities. * Relative humidity: Like temperature, RH standards, also allow for some fluctuations, although policies should take into account that excessive moisture or sudden dramatic shifts in relative humidity, can be harmful to almost all cultural heritage materials and may cause issues such as corrosion, mold growth, cracking, warping, or embrittlement. * Light: There are two types of light- ultraviolet (UV) and visual light as perceived by the human eye- that need to be addressed within collections management and care. The effects of visual light exposure is cumulative, but visual light is necessary to view and safely handle objects within a collection, which means that standards should be established to limit time and intensity levels of visual light exposure, without risking visitor or staff safety. UV light, on the other hand, is not necessary for viewing or handling of collections, and as such should be eliminated as much as possible through the use of filters in order to prevent damage such as yellowing or disintegration. * Contaminants: Contaminants can take a variety of forms such as gases, liquids, or solids, and they can pose threats not only to a collection, but also to those individuals that come in close contact with the pollutants. To ensure the safety of personnel and objects, it is necessary for a collection management policy to specify the proper methods for documenting and researching objects that are a risk for bringing contaminants into the collection, as well as explaining what precautions must be taken to prevent accidental contamination as the result of human error or the chemical breakdown of collection objects. Contaminated objects may show signs of disintegration, discoloration, or corrosion. Packing and transport Objects within a collection should ideally, be handled as little as possible since every time they are handled, they are at an increased risk of damage. Proper display and storage housing will help to mitigate some of the risks of accidental damage, but it is important to create and implement high standards for the routine care and handling, as well as the packing and transporting, of collection objects. It is extremely important to ensure that staff are aware of and educated on standard practices for handling objects such as hand washing protocols, the appropriate use of cotton or latex gloves, established practices for identifying structural weaknesses that may require special care, and the accepted modes of transportation of objects within the holding- institution (i.e. flatbeds, carts, tote pans, pads, and tissue papers). Sometimes a collector or institution will have a need to move objects outside of exhibit and storage locations. The collection management policy, which discusses the proper procedures for loans and acquisitions, must therefore also address proper packing and transport protocols to ensure that the objects arrive at their destination safely. To ensure safe transport, safe handling techniques must be combined with individual packing requirements for the specific object being shipped. Ideally, the object will be packaged in a shipping container that provides protection from shock, vibration, sudden climate changes, and mishandling. Collection management policies will advise staff on how best to address issues such as \\"the object's fragility, the shipping method, the climate through which the objects will travel, and the climate at the object's destination.\\" During the packing and transport process, it is likely that several departments within the shipping institution may contribute, and collaboration with the receiving institution must be arranged to provide policies for acclimatization and unpacking of the object once received. Integrated pest management Within the collections care section of a collections management policy, there is typically a section dedicated to integrated pest management (IPM). This section covers the policies related to the prevention and suppression methods of various types of pests typically found within collections. IPM focuses on utilizing non- pesticide prevention and treatment techniques in order to minimize health risks for personnel as well as damages to the collection itself. Examples of types of pests that should be addressed include \\"insects, mold, mice, rats, birds, and bats.\\" The collection management aspect of IPM involves creating and implementing policies for the routine inspection of objects and housing facilities, authorized trapping procedures, and documentation of all inspections or trapping programs utilized within the facility. These policies are called cultural controls, and the physical techniques utilized as part of the collections care are known as mechanical controls. Specific cultural controls that may be documented within the collections management policy include: * Standards for the inspection of all new materials to be brought into collection areas including new acquisitions and loans, and storage or packing materials. * Defined practices for daily collections maintenance and general housekeeping of collection-holding facilities. * Restrictions on areas within the building where food, drinks, and smoking are allowed and prohibited. * Documentation showing the careful monitoring of plants placed around the outside of the building, with special attention paid to the proximity of live plants and mulch to the building, in addition to banning live and dried plants within the building. * Policies for standard collections care including relative humidity, and storage and housing guidelines. U.S. Navy personnel move a damaged antique plane from the Lone Star Flight Museum during disaster recovery after Hurricane Ike in Galveston, Texas, September 21, 2008. =Emergency planning and response= Collections management focuses heavily on planning and response standards, and lays out these practices in documents detailing how staff responsible for the care of a collection should address the various needs of the collection. Created in conjunction with the collection management policy, most collecting institutions will also possess a disaster preparedness and emergency response policy that outlines what procedures should be taken to prevent injury or loss of life for all personnel and building visitors, as well as how to minimize damages or loss to the collection. This plan often contains a section identifying potential risks for the collection based on the region in which the collection is located, including fires, earthquakes, criminal activity, or flooding, in addition to damages from repairs, building failure, improper collections care, and neglect. The plan should also outline protocols for how to handle a disaster, starting with the chain of command within the emergency response team, as well as the individual responsibilities of each member of the staff. The emergency response team will include a managing official responsible for notifying other members of the team of a disaster and overseeing the implementation of the emergency response tasks. These staff members are typically trained in proper collection handling protocols. The disaster preparedness and emergency response plan should also include detailed instructions explaining how each type of disaster should be handled including the initial threat assessment and response, evacuation procedures where appropriate, damage mitigation plans, salvage priorities, and post-damage inventories and recovery procedures.

He then became a television executive, serving first at NBC before becoming Vice President of Movies at ABC. Hill produced four television miniseries, dozens of television movies and three drama series during his tenures at NBC and ABC. The popularity of television films had waned by the early 2000s, which prompted a career change by Hill. In 2001, switched to real estate development, with a focus on downtown Los Angeles and adaptive reuse. Hill partnered with Yuval Bar-Zemer, a developer with a history of reuse, to establish Linear City Development. Together, Hill and Bar-Zemer instigated numerous projects within the city's Arts District, on the eastern edge of Downtown Los Angeles by transforming existing buildings into new housing and developments. Hill's projects included the Toy Factory Lofts, which were finished in 2004, the nearby Biscuit Company Lofts, and the Elysian, which transformed the former headquarters of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California into residential building containing loft apartments near Echo Park in 2014. In 2016, Hill donated $1.9 million to create a new public park under the newly constructed Sixth Street Bridge. It was announced that the new park will be named in Hill's honor, following his death in 2016.

Mirroring the volunteerism the film witnessed, the project itself was a non-profit venture; time, labor, equipment, media, expertise, and talent were freely donated to the project. Adams produced the film alongside filmmaker Camron Carrier, as well as American musician and Franklin resident Mark Slaughter. Cinematographer Bill Cornelius, film editor Luke Dye, and composer Cody Westheimer all donated their time to the production of Nashville Rises as well. Release In January 2011, Nashville Rises was slotted to appear at Gatlinburg Screenfest (March 25-27, 2011), the 42nd Nashville Film Festival (April 22), as well as further showings at film festivals in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and London. In May 2011, the film was screened at the Belcourt Theater in Hillsboro, Tennessee for the anniversary of the floods; Slaughter (vis-à-vis Mark Slaughter's involvement) joined singer-songwriter and Nashville Rises interviewee Julie Roberts and more in performing at the charity event. Nashville Rises was scheduled to air on PBS late Summer 2011. =Finances= All proceeds from Nashville Rises will go to benefit Hands on Nashville, the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee, and the American Red Cross.

He started as quarterback for the Texas Longhorns in 1976. Early life Mike Cordaro played high school football at San Antonio Highlands High School. Though he would play quarterback in college, he didn't in high school where he was a kicker and played defensive back. College career Mike Cordaro came to Texas in 1975 without being recruited by the school and walked on to the team. His only scholarship offers had been to play baseball and football at Angelo State or to play at the junior college level at Bee County or Ranger. In his freshman year he didn't even make the roster and was redshirted, but by the following season he'd become the starting quarterback. Cordaro was originally placed on the defensive team of the scout team and he requested to be moved to the offensive team. During summer practices in 1975, secondary coach Timmy Doerr spotted him playing catch with other walk-ons and Head Coach Darrell Royal had him added as a quarterback. In the spring of 1976, he was battling Randy McEachern for the backup roll behind Ted Constanzo. He played surprisingly well in the spring finale and entered summer as the #2 quarterback. McEachern injured his knee in August and after an extremely close competition, Royal settled on Cordaro for the starting job over sophomore Constanzo who had started several games the previous year. He became the only walk on to ever start as quarterback for Royal, though he had been given a scholarship in the spring before he played. The Longhorns entered the season as the favorite to win the Southwest Conference Championship. The team featured future Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell and Olympic gold medalist Lam Jones. But when Earl Campbell pulled a hamstring in the opening game, and Texas was upset, the season started to slip away. Cordaro started the first seven games that season, including a 6-6 tie to #3 Oklahoma. But Royal lost confidence in him, pulling him in the first quarter against Texas Tech and trying two other signal callers in a 30-0 loss to Houston the following week. The following week, Constanzo was named the starter, though Cordaro saw significant playing time, in an embarrassing 30-0 loss to Houston. That led to both Cordaro and Constanzo being benched for the rest of the season in favor of true freshman Mark McBath. Cordaro would throw one more pass, incomplete, against TCU that season, and it would be the last time he'd play for Texas. He finished with a 3-2-1 record. It wound up being Darrell Royal's last season too. In 1977, he skipped much of spring drills to try his hand at baseball and thus was never in contention for the starter's job the following season, so instead he redshirted. In 1978, under coach Fred Akers, he transitioned to offensive end and the next year to wide receiver, but after the 1976 season he never took the field again.

The format relies on community involvement, audience engagement, social newsgathering and verification, data and analytics, and relationship-building. Social journalism takes place on some open publishing platforms, like Twitter and WordPress.com, but can also involve professional journalists, who created and/or screen the content. CNN's now-defunct iReport was an example of a social journalism collaboration between professionals and citizens; other examples include Forbes.com, infoStraight.com, Medium, BuzzFeed, Soapbox and Gawker. The model, which in some instances has generated monthly audiences in the tens of millions, has been discussed as one way for professional journalism to thrive despite a marked decline in the audience for traditional journalism. Publishers as platforms Writing in Re/code, Jonathan Glick, CEO of Sulia, said the model of publishers as platforms (which he calls a \\"platisher\\") is \\"on the rise\\". Glick cites as examples Medium (from Twitter co-founders Evan Williams and Biz Stone), Vox Media, Sulia, Skift, First Look Media (backed by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar) and BuzzFeed. On March 12, 2014, Mark Little, the CEO of Storyful, now a division of News Corp., proposed \\"10 Principles that Power Social Journalism,\\" including \\"UGC [User Generated Content] is governed by the same legal and ethical code as any other content\\" and \\"The currency of social journalism is authenticity not authority. We are not experts in every subject.\\". The new rules On April 1, 2014, in a column in GigaOM entitled \\"Social journalism and open platforms are the new normal — now we have to make them work\\" Mathew Ingram asked \\"How can media entities take advantage of this phenomenon without losing their way in the process?\\" and proceeded to review suggested rules for social journalism proposed by former FastCompany.com president Ed Sussman, an early adopter of the model. Ingram summarized these suggestions, including clear labeling types of contributors (e.g. staff, guest contributor, reader contribution); establishing guidelines, such as conflict of interest rules, that posters must consent to before posting; providing wiki-like tools for social improvements to content; elevating the best content with curators and algorithms; deleting weak or problematic content via curators or algorithms. Social journalism was attacked by media critic Michael Wolff in USA Today as the \\"Forbes vanity model letting ‘contributors’ write whatever they want under your brand (‘as I wrote in Forbes …’) and not having to pay them anything — ultimately, of course, devaluing your authority.\\" In a March 20, 2014 op-ed for The New York Observer, Sussman argued that social journalism does not devalue the authority of brands and that the success of Forbes.com in attracting a wide audience with its 1,000+ bloggers proved that the model could be successful for traditional media companies. Following revelations that some Forbes.com contributors used their columns to allegedly participate in a \\"pump and dump\\" scheme to promote, then sell stocks, he followed up with \\"The New Rules of Social Journalism: A Proposal\\" in Pando Daily, on March 29, 2014.

Traditional bing sutts only provide drinks and localized western snacks. Although serving western menus, they keep the price low and thus become popular among people from various social status. Yet along with the development of cha chaan tengs, chained fast food shops and coffee shops, which sell a larger variety of food, bing sutts became less competitive. In the 1980s, many had no choice but to refine the traditional menus by adding rice and noodles so as to increase their competitiveness. In 1980s, the cold drink market in Guangzhou ushered in a large number of new frozen foods. These new inventions helped bing sutt regain its popularity. In 1990s, most bing sutt mainly served to tong sui, milk, coconut milk, tortoise jelly, and other sorts of desserts. Others served dishes such as cake, fried dumplings, soup, glutinous rice, fast food lunch boxes, snacks, bread, congee, etc. In the summer, a small number of bing sutt would also serve ice cream, and cold drinks. In Guangzhou, bing sutt became a large of people’s lives. Gradually there emerged the “Four Great Bing Sutt”; it included the Shun Kee Bing, Mei Lei Kyun Bing Sutt, Sunshine Bing Sutt, and Emperor Bing Sutt (there also the Rainbow Bing Sutt and the Heung Kwan Bing Sutt).

The slogan opposed Sisi's campaign through mockery, and is based on a phrase coined during the British colonial period in Egypt. The origin The term (), translates in English to \\"the pimp,\\" sometimes used as a nickname for Al-Sisi (pimp العرص or السيسي العرص ). Egyptians used the term during the British colonial era to describe a policeman who monitors prostitutes in their profession. The expression evolved recently into a popular hashtag against the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi after he announced his candidacy for the upcoming presidential election. The term has been used to refer to the general's supporters by some Egyptian activists since September 2013. The rise Keyhole reported that the hashtag started circulating social media on the 26 of March 2014, when General Sisi announced his candidacy for the presidency. According to the tracking website, Keyhole, the hashtag achieved more than 100 million uses within days of creation, and generated tens of thousands of messages on Twitter. Keyhole states that 23 percent of the hashtag's uses came from outside Egypt. As of 2 April 2014, almost one week after the campaign started, the number of uses surpassed 490 million. On 7 April 2014, Aljazeera reported that the hashtag was broadly popular. Outside social media Since the campaign started, a trend has been going on in Egypt to paint and write the hashtag onto walls and government property. Most notably government buses. Moreover, the hashtag popularity encouraged some people who are computer illiterate to insult the coup's leader. On 1 April 2014, 4 days after the hashtag has been trending, the Android play store published an app allowing users to follow on the topic updates and trends. The app received an overwhelming response from users, where 78 out of 81 who rated the app gave it 5 stars. Two weeks later, some Americans used the alternative hashtag #Vote_for_the_pimp to protest against the Egyptian finance minister, who was in the U.S. after being invited by the United States Chamber of Commerce (USCC). On 26 May 2014, the day preceding the Egyptian presidential election, 2014, signs reading \\"Vote for the pimp\\" were seen hung across the country and some representations of the same slogan had been put into graffiti. On the same day, it was reported that an image of the face of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had been stamped on a trash bin, with the popular \\"Vote for the pimp\\" slogan written in Arabic. As of 28 May 2014, the last day in the elections, the turnout was the lowest possible with efforts to bring in more voters expressed by country officials and various state-linked media channels. While some attribute the boycott to earlier calls by the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, others see it as a reflection of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's unpopularity. Opposing the trend After the trend went global, some popular Egyptian television presenters were reported asking the government to block Twitter as a counter measure.

The full title of this poem is Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture, A Song Submitted to Supervisor Zheng and Advisor Li, in One Hundred Rhymes (according to title translation by Alfreda Murck). As a poem, \\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\" is an example of Tang poetry, which received considerable attention during the Song dynasty, in Song poetry, and later, even through modern times. During the Song dynasty Du Fu's \\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\" received particular attention, with the poem being subtly alluded to through rhyme-scheme referencing by Su Shi and his circle: in other words, Su Shi and the poets of his circle wrote poems which utilized the same rhyming words from Du Fu's poem, thus subtly referencing the sense and sentiment of Du Fu's line, but without overtly stating what might be censured as inappropriate. This allowed him and others to express opinions about government and society, without suffering the consequences, as Su Shi had previously done, in the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial, when his poetry was used as evidence resulting in his conviction and exile. Literary source(s) Du Fu's poem \\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\" can be found in scroll 230 of the Quantangshi. Background =Geography= Kuimen (夔門/夔门): the \\"Gateway of Kuizhou\\", Qutang Gorge (formerly Kui Gorge, or 夔峡, Kuixia), along the Yangzi River. Map showing approximate location of Kuizhou, along the Yangzi River, during the Tang dynasty of China. \\"China\\" appears as \\"hina\\". Kui Prefecture is also known as \\"Kuizhou Circuit\\" and \\"Kuizhou\\" (), or just \\"Kui\\": this politically-organized geographic entity was initially established in 619 CE, and was an important area from the beginning and through the end of the Tang dynasty of China, when it was alternatively part of several of the Circuits which made up Tang dynastic era large scale political structural organizations. Kui Prefecture was located in what is now eastern Chongqing. Part of the historic importance of Kuizhou is related to its location on the Yangzi River. Kuizhou (Kui Prefecture) was located in the Three Gorges area of the Yangzi River, a main transportation east-west corridor through China, which made use of the Yangzi River for transportation by water. Kui was also known for spectacular scenery, and being a location in which exiled poets wrote their laments: it has been considered part of the Xiaoxiang. =History= Kui Prefecture (Kuizhou) was an area typical of many areas which were part of the southern Tang Empire that experienced an increase in population and development as a result of the disasters beginning with and following the An Lushan rebellion (also known as the Anshi disturbances). Later, toward the end of the Tang Dynasty this area which was formerly a refuge became itself the center of military activity leading to the breakup of the Tang imperial dynasty and the development of the independent states of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The Kuizhou area was held by the Han dynasty: during this time, it was known as \\"Baidi\\", or \\"White Emperor\\", in English, and later Chinese poetry has used this as a metonymn. =Xiaoxiang poetry= Imaginary tour through Xiao-xiang. Song dynasty painting. Xiaoxiang poetry is one of the Classical Chinese poetry genres, one practiced for over a thousand years. It is a poetry of scenic wonders, a poetry of officials exiled for their views and beliefs, and a poetry of dissent against submitting to government control. Xiaoxiang poetry is geographically associated with the Xiaoxiang region, around and south of Dongting Lake, including Kuizhou. The Xiaoxiang genre of literature is often associated with similarly themed Chinese calligraphy and Chinese painting. Famous poets in this genre include Du Fu, and the main theme of this type of poetry is more-or-less that of the government official who has been exiled and sent to some peerlessly remote area, such as the Xiaoxiang. =Du Fu= The author of \\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\" is Du Fu (; 712 – 770), one of the most prominent poets of the Tang poetry practitioners. Much or most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of empress Wu. The An Lushan rebellion began in December 755, and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years, and ended the \\"golden age\\" of the Tang dynasty. It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society, and loss of millions of human population. Du Fu was displaced from his homeland in the north, and at one point ended up in Kuizhou, where he is presumed to have written \\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\". Poem \\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\" consists of 200 lines of 100 rhymed couplets (Murck, passim). It is called \\"one-hundred rhymes\\" because the rhyme is at the end of the couplet. Song dynastic era follow- up During the Song dynasty Du Fu's \\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\" received particular attention, with the poem being subtly alluded to through rhyme- scheme referencing by Su Shi and his circle. This allowed him and others to express opinions about government and society, without suffering the consequences, as Su Shi did in the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial. References *Murck, Alfreda (2000).

The objectives of the Program are to provide the necessary competencies and skills to improve the quality of the educational institutions and of the system of higher education, increasing its international competitiveness, sustaining social and economic development, and ensuring that no talent is lost because of differences in learning opportunities. Specifically, the Program MECESUP - belonging to the Division of Higher Education at the Ministry of Education in Chile \\\\- provides incremental financing to projects and plans to improve institutional quality awarded by competitive means through the Academic Innovation Fund (AIF) or negotiated through Performance Agreements(PBA). Since its inception in 1999 and until April 2013, the Program MECESUP has been led by Dr. Ricardo Reich,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-reich-0954a54/ chemical engineer, former professor and former Vice-President of Research of the Universidad de Concepción in Chile. Since its initial implementation in 1999, MECESUP has counted with the sustained financial support of the State of Chile and the World Bank (Loans N°4404-CH, 7317-CH and 8126-CL), allocated 1,032 AIF projects (1999-2014), 4 pilot PBA (2007-2010), 6 PBA in the humanities, arts and social sciences (2010-2015) and 64 PBA in a scale-up that defined priority areas. Total resources allocated to the MECESUP Program during the period 1999-2015 were US$645 million. These resources were incremental to basal funding for the higher education institutions and amounted in average to 12% of the total. Additionally, US$155 million of State funding were allocated to implement PBA in science-based innovation and institutional development of regional institutions.  History  In 1998, the Government of Chile agreed with the World Bank (loan N°4404-CH) the design and implementation of an ambitious program to improve the quality of higher education, which was baptized with the acronym MECESUP. In full expansion of college tuition, the program funded actions of academic improvement and infrastructure in the 25 universities of the Council of Rectors of Chilean universities (CRUCH), contributing to a significant increase in equity in the access to quality of students throughout the country. The program MECESUP considered initially a capacity-building component, the design and implementation of an experimental process of voluntary accreditation of institutions and programs, and the creation of a Competitive Fund, which replaced the old Institutional Development Fund (with historical allocation). The committed investment for 5 years was US$245 million, with an average annual budget of US$50 million. Eligible expenses considered the development of academic staff at the Ph.D. level and advanced training; modernisation of libraries and generation of study areas for students; management of information and knowledge; integration of information and communication technologies to the teaching-learning processes; new laboratory equipment; modern classrooms and use of multimedia; as well as fellowships for doctoral programs and research. = First Phase (1999-2005) = In the first phase of the MECESUP Program (loan 4404-CH)), the general assumption was that the investment in infrastructure would improve the academic teaching and student learning, and therefore graduate employability. Some dimensions that were taken into account to allocate resources, were the impact of the services provided to students; consistency with the institutional development plans; availability of human resources to implement the projects awarded; and financial and operational sustainability, among others. The Competitive Fund, after 6 continuous years of competition calls, supported the deployment of nearly 400 projects, with averages of investment per institutional improvement plan of US$550,000. 70% of the resources were devoted to the improvement of undergraduate education in regional institutions. 20% Of the total budget was invested in the empowerment and development of the national Ph.D. programs. A 10% was allocated to the modernization of the centers of technical training (CFT) to improve teaching and learning in technology areas of interest to the productive sector. In spite of the many and obvious achievements, the Competitive Fund, as the only mechanism for allocating resources for academic quality improvement, showed some limitations. One of them was the difficulty in supporting the solution of complex problems of an institutional nature, such as strategic planning, management improvement, monitoring of the impact of goals and results, and the employability of its graduates. = Second Phase (2006-2011) = As a result of the lessons learned during the implementation of the MECESUP Program, the Government decided in 2005 to begin a second phase (MECESUP2), agreeing with the World Bank a new loan (N° 7317-CH), and complementing the Competitive Fund - now called Academic Innovation Fund (AIF) - with the experimental (pilot) implementation of 4 performance agreements in accredited State universities: Tarapacá (in Arica), Chile (in Santiago), Bío- Bío (in Concepción) and La Frontera (in Temuco). There were also special resources assigned from the Chilean Bicentennial Program to 5 PBA in the areas of the humanities, arts and social sciences. The level of annual funding for all these activities was ensured by US$100 million. =Third Phase (2012-2016)= Considering the successful evaluation of the pilot in PBA, the new Government decided in 2011 to start a significant scaling-up phase (MECESUP3), this time by agreeing with the World Bank a third loan (N° 8126-CL) aimed at providing technical advice and ensuring an international quality audit to the institutional improvement plans awarded. Along with calls for PBA in the 2012-2015 period, it started the implementation of an enhanced version of the Academic Innovation Fund that includes some institutional negotiation to improve the improvement plans. The resources allocated during these two years amounting to USD$80 million. After an initial institutional eligibility limited to CRUCH universities and accredited CFT, the MECESUP Program opened eligibility to all universities, technical training centers and professional institutes in Chile that were institutionally accredited by the National Accreditation Commission (Act 20.129).  Mechanisms  =The Academic Innovation Fund= The Academic Innovation Fund (AIF) http://portales.mineduc.cl/usuarios/MECESUP/File/2012/ingles/FIAC_lessonlearned2010.pdf is a financing instrument for the competitive allocation of State resources which encourage activities in eligible academic institutions of the Chilean tertiary education system with features of consistency, responsiveness, equity and quality. Its design is flexible, with specific objectives and thematic areas for priority actions in each competition call. Institutional proposals must be consistent with institutional strategic planning and designed for management by results. Assessment is achieved with national and foreign external peers that evaluate proposals. The evaluation and selection process is based on clear and transparent eligibility and selection criteria that assure equal opportunities and technical rigor. The resources allocated to the best proposals are transferred to the beneficiary institutions for its decentralized management. Academic innovation funds have been supported by the World Bank in several countries http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079956815/ED_WPS1_Innovation_Fund_Guide_May06.pdf/ and are operationalised with projects that are implemented with management by results. =Performance Agreements= A Performance Agreement (PBA) http://www.mineduc.cl/index3.php?id_portal=59&id;_seccion=4160&id;_contenido=19268 is a contract between the State and a higher education institution which commit outstanding performances that involve a significant institutional improvement and which alone could not have been able to achieve. It is an institutional financing mechanism for allocating resources of advanced conceptual design and high strategic impact, which provides funding on the basis of results and allows institutions to generate transformative initiatives, capable of facing structural problems of different nature that can significantly improve their academic quality. For a system of higher education that has to face important challenges, the PBA offer relevant opportunities in the strengthening of organizational efforts and resources towards the achievement of outstanding outcomes, generation of competitive advantages and strategic positioning in functional or knowledge areas that can be improved and replicated in other institutions. Performance agreements consider an institutional plan of improvement, agreed between both parties, that is implemented with management by results and a monitoring and evaluation process based on indicators and performance. =Priority Areas of Investment= The performance agreements of the MECESUP program have been prioritised in the following thematic areas: * Institutional priorities (Pilot phase) * Improvement of the humanities, arts and social sciences * Modernization of teacher training * Modernization of the undergraduate curriculum based on competencies and learning outcomes (including the support of Ph.D. programs) * Science-based innovation * Quality improvement of regional institutions.

The band is characterized by their energetic live show, dual male-female lead vocals, and eclectic musical influences. History Goodnight, Sunrise was formed in 2011 by David Kochberg and Vanessa Vakharia who had both played in Toronto band The Big Deal. Along with friend and former Glueleg bassist Andrew \\"Chowder\\" Charters, they recorded their first EP Fragments as a three piece. The addition of drummer Paul Weaver in February 2012 completed the four member group, leading into their first festival performance at the 2012 Canadian Music Week. The group's first full- length album Create/Destroy/Create was released in March 2013 and co-produced by Kochberg and sound engineer Chris Sampson. The 9 song pseudo-concept album demonstrated the band's eclectic influences and drew upon cyclical themes of introspection, self-destruction, and redemption. The album artwork, an intricate ambigram design, was designed by Polish artist Daniel Dostal. Create/Destroy/Create received consistent radio play across Canada throughout Summer 2013, from British Columbia to Ontario. In December 2013, Goodnight, Sunrise followed Create/Destroy/Create with the first in an ongoing series of split-singles. Unlike most of the band's album songs in which Kochberg and Vakharia share lead vocals, the D/V series feature one song by each of them (resulting in a \\"Side D\\" with David on lead and a \\"Side V\\" with Vanessa). D/V 1: Deaf Ears was recorded in Lucan, Ontario at Swamp Songs Studios and mastered by Noah Mintz at Lacquer Channel Mastering. This was followed by D/V 2: Bridgeburner in July 2014, recorded with new bassist Thor Thunders after the amicable departure of Charters. Thunders departed at the end of 2014, and the band recruited Pedro Salles (formerly of Brazilian band Avec Tristesse). In September 2015 the band completed a 20-date tour of Eastern Canada to support the release of Deal With It, the first single from their upcoming 2nd album. The second single, \\"Familiar Faces\\", was released in July 2016, and the Sept 2016 Falling Awake album release was supported by a 17-date tour across Ontario, the United Kingdom, and a final show in Amsterdam. In May 2018, Goodnight, Sunrise was selected by Q107 to be the opening act for Bon Jovi at the Air Canada Centre on May 12. This was followed by a cross-Canada summer tour supporting their new single \\"Runaways\\" with performances at Evolve Festival, Riverfest Elora, and Dawson City Music Festival in Dawson City, Yukon. In November 2018 they released their first recorded cover, a modern pop-rock version of Gordon Lightfoot's acoustic ballad \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\". 2019 brought their first show in the US, performing at The NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA, as well as a 30-date Western Canada summer tour behind the singles \\"WVV\\" and \\"Don't Want It To End\\". With their blend of classic rock and indie synth pop, the music of Goodnight, Sunrise shows a range of influences such as Florence + The Machine, Muse, Metric, CHVRCHES, and Foo Fighters, and the dual male-female lead vocals of Kochberg and Vakharia are reminiscent of bands like Of Monsters and Men, Blink-182, and July Talk. Goodnight, Sunrise has toured throughout Canada, the US and Europe, and has performed at Canadian Music Week, North by Northeast, and Indie Week Europe.

He made his MLB debut with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2014, and has also played for the Houston Astros. Exposed to baseball at an early age, Giles played the game while attending Rio Grande High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Although he was drafted out of high school by the Florida Marlins, Giles instead enrolled at Yavapai College, where he played college baseball until the Phillies drafted him in the seventh round (241st overall) of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. Giles quickly progressed through the Phillies' Minor League Baseball (MiLB) system, overcoming two oblique injuries to participate in major league spring training before the 2014 season. Although he began that season in MiLB, Giles soon received a promotion to the major leagues, making his debut on June 12. One of the team's few bright spots that season, Giles finished fourth in National League Rookie of the Year voting. Giles opened the 2015 season as the team's primary setup man, but when the Phillies traded their closer (Jonathan Papelbon), Giles assumed that role. Renowned for his fastball that can reach upwards of , Giles is a power pitcher who pairs his fastball with a slider to compile high strike-out rates. Early life Giles was born on September 20, 1990 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. From an early age, he was exposed to baseball. His father, Glenn, who had never played baseball himself, apparently saw potential in Ken when he was in pre- school to be a baseball player, and encouraged him to pursue the sport at that young age. Giles attended Rio Grande High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he played baseball, although he was mainly an outfielder, and used his arm strength to throw out runners rather than pitch. He also played football and basketball in college, but focused predominantly on baseball. Giles was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 44th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign and instead attended Yavapai College, which Giles praised as a great place to focus on baseball without having to go to a large university. At Yavapai, the alma mater of Curt Schilling, Giles began pitching regularly, and realized his talent on the mound. At Yavapai, he posted a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) with 67 strikeouts in 38 innings pitched (15.9 strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9)). Professional career =Minor leagues= Giles was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the seventh round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft, and he signed with the club despite initially committing to transfer to play college baseball for the University of Arizona. He made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Phillies that year, and made three appearances with the team. He opened the 2012 season with the Low-A Lakewood BlueClaws, and after finding success there – he recorded five saves and a 3.61 ERA, working mostly as a reliever (although occasionally as a starter) – he earned a promotion to the Class A-Advanced Clearwater Threshers, with whom he worked solely out of the bullpen, and posted a 3.07 ERA and .183 batting average against (BAA). In 2013, he returned to Clearwater. During the season, he strained each oblique, limiting him to only 24 appearances, and perhaps hurting his control on the mound, as his walk rate ballooned to 6.7 every nine innings, in comparison to 5.5 the preceding year. After the season, he pitched in the Arizona Fall League, at which point MLBPipeline.com commentator Bernie Pleskoff said \\"his (Giles') command and control are a little behind his velocity\\", but that he was a \\"terrific, closer-type arm\\" who reminded him of Jonathan Papelbon, whom Giles was a candidate to – and ultimately did – replace as the Phillies' closer. Other scouts questioned his aptitude as a major league pitcher due to his \\"penchant for wildness.\\" Aside from one outing in which he surrendered six runs without recording a single out, Giles' ERA in the Arizona Fall League was 0.00 (with that outing, it was 5.23). He finished the season facing an uncertain developmental future, as his velocity was universally acknowledged, but his durability and control universally questioned. As observers expected, Giles began the 2014 season with the Reading Phillies after spending some time with the major league club during spring training. Through his first seven appearances, he allowed only two hits, and routinely reached over with his fastball. His primary focus was developing a secondary pitch, namely a slider, and working on locating his fastball within the strike zone. With the worst bullpen in the major leagues, the Phillies faced mounting pressure to accelerate Giles' ascent through the minor leagues, but both manager Ryne Sandberg and general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. preached patience, asserting that he needed more time to develop. On May 9, Giles was promoted to the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs to further hone his skills, and receive the chance to face better hitters, closer to what he would eventually face in the major leagues. In 11 appearances at Triple-A, he posted a 2.63 ERA, but struck out just nine in comparison to eight walks issued. In regards to striking out fewer batters, Giles said, \\"They (Triple-A hitters) were more experienced, but I wasn't trying to do too much. I wasn't trying to strike everyone out kind of thing. I just tried to make good pitches and get outs. Get out of innings as quick as possible. The less pitches I had, the better.\\" =Philadelphia Phillies= On June 7, 2014, Giles was promoted to the major leagues after the Phillies placed Mike Adams on the disabled list (DL). Four days after the promotion, he made his major league debut in a game against the San Diego Padres, and relinquished a home run to his first batter, but then worked through the inning to preserve a lead for the Phillies, who won the game. His first winning decision came on August 10 against the New York Mets. On September 1, Giles was part of a combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves; Cole Hamels, Giles, Jake Diekman, and Papelbon did not allow a hit in the game's nine innings. Later that month, Giles picked up his first save as a major league pitcher in a game against the Oakland Athletics on September 20. Giles ranked among the best relievers in the major leagues in many key statistical categories relating to strikeouts, ERA, and walks plus hits per innings pitched (WHIP). He also represented a bright spot for the Phillies – and a point of pride for the fan base – during a rebuilding phase for the team. Adam Dembowitz of Crashburn Alley, an ESPN affiliated blog, wrote, \\"He's pretty awesome. He's cheap and young and he's a Phillie. Ken Giles is one of the reasons we should all feel good about this offseason and the current rebuilding period.\\" Giles finished fourth in the National League Rookie of the Year voting. He finished the season with a 3–1 record, a 1.18 ERA, and one save in 44 games. Coming off a \\"meteoric rise through the Phillies' organization last season en route to becoming one of the top young relievers in baseball\\", Giles opened the 2015 Philadelphia Phillies season firmly implanted as the team's setup man, with his goal of being the team's closer something he did not take for granted, noting he had to \\"earn that position.\\" Early in the season, he was not as dominant as he had been during his rookie season, but still was among the best relievers in the major leagues. Scouts observed that Giles had an inclination to use his slider more often to compensate for command of his fastball that needed improvement. When the Phillies traded Jonathan Papelbon to the Washington Nationals on July 28, Giles became the team's regular closer; in his first outing as such, he recorded a save against the Toronto Blue Jays. =Houston Astros= On December 12, 2015, the Phillies traded Giles and Jonathan Arauz to the Houston Astros in exchange for Mark Appel, Vince Velasquez, Brett Oberholtzer, Tom Eshelman, and Harold Arauz. In 2016, Giles made 69 appearances with a 2–5 record, a 4.11 ERA, and 15 saves. In 2017, he made 63 appearances with a 1–3 record, a 2.30 ERA, and 34 saves. The Astros finished the year 101–61, and eventually won the 2017 World Series for their first championship. However, Giles was ineffective in the postseason; by the end of the World Series, the Astros had stopped using him.https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/astros-ken-giles-projects- as-closer-despite-postseason-funk/ On February 2, 2018, Giles won his arbitration case versus the Astros, for a $4.6 million salary. The Astros had proposed $4.2 million. Giles struggled throughout the beginning of the 2018 season, allowing 17 earned runs on 36 hits in innings. The Astros demoted him to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League on July 11. =Toronto Blue Jays= On July 30, 2018, the Astros traded Giles, Héctor Pérez, and David Paulino to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roberto Osuna. Giles appeared in 21 games for the Blue Jays in 2018, pitching to a 4.12 ERA with 14 saves and 22 strikeouts over 19 innings. Giles successfully converted 34 consecutive save opportunities in a streak that began on September 12, 2017, when he was still a member of the Astros, and ended on April 11, 2019 in a game against the Boston Red Sox. On May 10, Giles earned his 100th career save when he closed out a 4–3 win against the Chicago White Sox. Giles entered the All-Star break with a 1.45 ERA, 13 saves, and 53 strikeouts over 31 innings. His ERA was the seventh best among qualified relievers prior to the break, and his 1.50 fielding independent pitching (FIP) was the best among qualified American League relievers, and the second best among all qualified major league relievers. On July 20, Giles set a Blue Jays franchise record by recording his 26th consecutive relief appearance with at least one strikeout. Giles finished the 2019 season with a 1.87 ERA and 83 strikeouts in 53 innings. With the 2020 Toronto Blue Jays, Giles appeared in 4 games, compiling a 0-0 record with 9.82 ERA and 6 strikeouts in 3.2 innings pitched.https://www.mlb.com/player/ken-giles-571704 On September 30, 2020, Giles underwent Tommy John surgery.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2020/10/ken- giles-tommy-john-surgery-blue-jays.html Pitching style A power pitcher, Giles' fastball has hit as high as , and he relies on it in tandem with a slider in which he spent much of his developmental phase building confidence. His fastball typically registers around , in contrast to a slider that registers around . Very occasionally, he mixes in a change up and sinker. He has always had an aptitude for striking out hitters, which potentially obviated the need for him to record as many groundouts as other pitchers needed to be successful. A slight decline in fastball velocity, at the beginning of the 2015 season, helped him develop more command, something he called a \\"blessing in disguise.\\" Personal life Giles married Estela Piñon, a former softball pitcher at the University of Arizona, in 2015. The couple gave birth to their first child, a son named Brody, in August 2016.

Originally known just as Jones Neck, it is bounded on the west by the St. Jones River, on the north by Little Creek (roughly, the southeast boundary of Dover Air Force Base), and on the east by Delaware Bay. The area consists of low rolling hills that do not rise very much above sea level, interspersed with bodies of fresh and salt water. Streams are headed by marshes, and there are tidal marshlands along the bay. The neck has pockets of woodland which are concentrated near the freshwater marshes and tributaries. Land use in the neck is at present predominantly agricultural. Prehistory The St. Jones Neck area has seen human activity for about 8,000 years. The clearest evidence of early human use occurs in the Late Archaic Period (between 4000 and 2000 BCE), a period in which a surface-level archaeological survey identified sixteen sites associated with this time period. Five of these (K-873, K-891, K-913, K-914, and K-920) have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as have another five (K-875, K-876, K-880, K-915, and K-916) associated with later periods. Analysis suggests that these sites were only short-term encampments, but excavations may yield more information. Activity in the area apparently subsided until the Middle Woodland Period (700 BCE – 1000 AD), a time in which the native population began producing ceramics. Three sites (K-913, K-915, and K-891) included finds of the earliest types of ceramics from this period. At one site (K-875), trade goods from as far off as present-day Ohio were found. Usage of the land continued to be seasonal and transitional in nature until the Late Woodland Period (after 1000 AD) in which evidence of longer-term stable seasonal bases of operations appeared. K-891, in particular, appears to have been a major seasonal base, affiliated with a more permanent village elsewhere. K-914 is the only prehistoric native site with evidence of European contact; it lies adjacent to one of the earliest European contact points in the region. History The Kent County area did not come under significant colonial control until Delaware came under the control of James, the Duke of York. Under his administration, which began in the 1670s, land grants were made on St. Jones Neck. One of the notable land grants was to Daniel Jones, whose daughter married William Rodney, the grandfather of Delaware statesman Caesar Rodney. Only archaeological remnants are left of the Jones-Rodney Byfield estate. Although these tracts of land would have been cleared and farmed by the grantees and their descendants, over time they became tenant farms, as the comparatively wealthy landowners moved to live in more urban settings. During the late 18th century, the lands of the neck along the St. Jones River were almost entirely bought up by Delaware and Pennsylvania statesman John Dickinson. Dickinson spent time at his father's house, built c. 1740, on the neck, and organized his extensive holdings (several thousand acres at its greatest extent) into a collection of tenant farms. Much of this land remained in the hands of Dickinson descendants well into the 20th century. In other portions of the neck the larger tracts were gradually broken down in the 19th century, but larger-scale agriculture in the 20th century again coalesced some of these parcels together.

Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c.1800–1550 BC, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, excerpts available online here. As such, Merkheperre would have reigned either over Upper Egypt from Thebes or over Middle and Upper Egypt from Memphis. At the time, the Eastern Nile Delta was under the domination of the 14th Dynasty.  Attestations  Merkheperre appears on the Turin canon, a king list compiled in the early Ramesside period. According to the egyptologist Kim Ryholt, the canon gives his prenomen on the 8th column, line 17 (Gardiner entry 7.22 Alan H. Gardiner: The Royal Canon of Turin, Oxford 1959, Vol. III, 6.14, Warminster 1987, .). The Turin papyrus is damaged on the section covering the late 13th Dynasty and Merkheperre's reign length is lost in a lacuna. Merkheperre is also attested by two artefacts dating to his reign: a glazed weight of grey schist bearing his cartouche, now in the Petrie Museum UC 16372Weight of Merkheperre on Digital Egypt for UniversitiesCatalogue of the Petrie museum and a scarab inscribed with his name. Although the scarab is accepted as evidence of Merkheperre by Darrell Baker, Jürgen von Beckerath, Stephen Quirke and others, Kim Ryholt rejects this attribution.Darrell D. Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300–1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 214 Ryholt points to its lack of royal attributes and insignia as well as its stylistic features which depart from other royal seals of the 13th Dynasty. Rather, Ryholt proposes that the scarab simply represents Khepri pushing the sun.  Chronological position  The exact chronological position of Merkheperre is not known for certain as the damaged state of the Turin canon only allows for conjectural reconstructions of the late 13th dynasty. According to Ryholt he was the forty-seventh ruler of the dynasty, while Baker sees him as the forty-sixth and von Beckerath as the fifty-seventh.Jürgen von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der Zweiten Zwischenzeit in Ägypten, Glückstadt, 1964Jürgen von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen Ägyptens, Münchner Ägyptologische Studien 46.

Orbit and classification  ' is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO), located beyond the orbit of Neptune (30.1 AU). The Johnston's archive classifies it as an unspecific \\"other TNO\\", meaning that the minor planet is neither a resonant nor a classical TNO. Astronomer Michael Brown considers ' to be a \\"likely\\" dwarf-planet candidate, a moderate-probability third place out of his five- level ranking system, as its estimated diameter is a little under 600 kilometers. Taking the mean of the two magnitudes, and using the standard 0.25 ~ 0.05 range for minor planets of unknown albedo, a wider 335 to 748 km spread of possibilities can be calculated for the actual diameter.

The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on 20 February 2001, over 10 years prior to its official discovery observation at Cerro Tololo. The object was first announced on 2 April 2014, when American astronomers Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo at the CTIO in Chile published their observations in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular. At the time the object was at 49 AU from the Sun and had an apparent magnitude of 21.1. The Pan-STARRS-1 survey at the Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in the United States also found precovery observations of 2013 FZ27 after 2013 FZ27 was announced and reported them to the Minor Planet Center at a later date.

Optimal BSTs are generally divided into two types: static and dynamic. In the static optimality problem, the tree cannot be modified after it has been constructed. In this case, there exists some particular layout of the nodes of the tree which provides the smallest expected search time for the given access probabilities. Various algorithms exist to construct or approximate the statically optimal tree given the information on the access probabilities of the elements. In the dynamic optimality problem, the tree can be modified at any time, typically by permitting tree rotations. The tree is considered to have a cursor starting at the root which it can move or use to perform modifications. In this case, there exists some minimal-cost sequence of these operations which causes the cursor to visit every node in the target access sequence in order. The splay tree is conjectured to have a constant competitive ratio compared to the dynamically optimal tree in all cases, though this has not yet been proven.  Static optimality  = Definition = In the static optimality problem as defined by Knuth, we are given a set of ordered elements and a set of 2n+1 probabilities. We will denote the elements a_1 through a_n and the probabilities A_1 through A_n and B_0 through B_n. A_i is the probability of a search being done for element a_i. For 1 \\\\le i < n, B_i is the probability of a search being done for an element between a_i and a_{i+1}, B_0 is the probability of a search being done for an element strictly less than a_1, and B_n is the probability of a search being done for an element strictly greater than a_n. These 2n+1 probabilities cover all possible searches, and therefore add up to one. The static optimality problem is the optimization problem of finding the binary search tree that minimizes the expected search time, given the 2n+1 probabilities. As the number of possible trees on a set of elements is {2n \\\\choose n}\\\\frac{1}{n+1}, which is exponential in , brute-force search is not usually a feasible solution. = Knuth's dynamic programming algorithm = In 1971, Knuth published a relatively straightforward dynamic programming algorithm capable of constructing the statically optimal tree in only O(n2) time. Knuth's primary insight was that the static optimality problem exhibits optimal substructure; that is, if a certain tree is statically optimal for a given probability distribution, then its left and right subtrees must also be statically optimal for their appropriate subsets of the distribution. To see this, consider what Knuth calls the \\"weighted path length\\" of a tree. The weighted path length of a tree on n elements is the sum of the lengths of all 2n+1 possible search paths, weighted by their respective probabilities. The tree with the minimal weighted path length is, by definition, statically optimal. But weighted path lengths have an interesting property. Let E be the weighted path length of a binary tree, be the weighted path length of its left subtree, and be the weighted path length of its right subtree. Also let W be the sum of all the probabilities in the tree. Observe that when either subtree is attached to the root, the depth of each of its elements (and thus each of its search paths) is increased by one. Also observe that the root itself has a depth of one. This means that the difference in weighted path length between a tree and its two subtrees is exactly the sum of every single probability in the tree, leading to the following recurrence: :E = E_L + E_R + W This recurrence leads to a natural dynamic programming solution. Let E_{ij} be the weighted path length of the statically optimal search tree for all values between and , let W_{ij} be the total weight of that tree, and let R_{ij} be the index of its root. The algorithm can be built using the following formulas: :\\\\begin{align} E_{i,i-1} = W_{i,i-1} &= B_{i-1} \\\\operatorname{for} 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ W_{i,j} &= W_{i,j-1} + A_j + B_j \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_{i, j} &= \\\\min_{i\\\\leq r \\\\leq j}(E_{i,r-1} + E_{r+1,j}+W_{i,j}) \\\\operatorname{for} 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n \\\\end{align} :The naive implementation of this algorithm actually takes O(n3) time, but Knuth's paper includes some additional observations which can be used to produce a modified algorithm taking only O(n2) time. = Mehlhorn's approximation algorithm = While the O(n2) time taken by Knuth's algorithm is substantially better than the exponential time required for a brute-force search, it is still too slow to be practical when the number of elements in the tree is very large. In 1975, Kurt Mehlhorn published a paper proving that a much simpler algorithm could be used to closely approximate the statically optimal tree in only time. In this algorithm, the root of the tree is chosen so as to most closely balance the total weight (by probability) of the left and right subtrees. This strategy is then applied recursively on each subtree. That this strategy produces a good approximation can be seen intuitively by noting that the weights of the subtrees along any path form something very close to a geometrically decreasing sequence. In fact, this strategy generates a tree whose weighted path length is at most :2+(1 - \\\\log(\\\\sqrt{5} - 1))^{-1}H = 2 + \\\\frac H {1 - \\\\log(\\\\sqrt{5} - 1)} where H is the entropy of the probability distribution. Since no optimal binary search tree can ever do better than a weighted path length of :(1/\\\\log3)H = \\\\frac H {\\\\log 3} this approximation is very close. =Hu–Tucker and Garsia–Wachs algorithms= In the special case that all of the A_i values are zero, the optimal tree can be found in time O(n\\\\log n). This was first proved by T. C. Hu and Alan Tucker in a paper that they published in 1971. A later simplification by Garsia and Wachs, the Garsia–Wachs algorithm, performs the same comparisons in the same order. The algorithm works by using a greedy algorithm to build a tree that has the optimal height for each leaf, but is out of order, and then constructing another binary search tree with the same heights.. See also History and bibliography, pp. 453–454.  Dynamic optimality  = Definition = There are several different definitions of dynamic optimality, all of which are effectively equivalent to within a constant factor in terms of running-time. The problem was first introduced implicitly by Sleator and Tarjan in their paper on splay trees, but Demaine et al. give a very good formal statement of it. In the dynamic optimality problem, we are given a sequence of accesses x1, ..., xm on the keys 1, ..., n. For each access, we are given a pointer to the root of our BST and may use the pointer to perform any of the following operations: # Move the pointer to the left child of the current node. # Move the pointer to the right child of the current node. # Move the pointer to the parent of the current node. # Perform a single rotation on the current node and its parent. (It is the presence of the fourth operation, which rearranges the tree during the accesses, which makes this the dynamic optlmality problem.) For each access, our BST algorithm may perform any sequence of the above operations as long as the pointer eventually ends up on the node containing the target value xi. The time it takes a given dynamic BST algorithm to perform a sequence of accesses is equivalent to the total number of such operations performed during that sequence. Given any sequence of accesses on any set of elements, there is some minimum total number of operations required to perform those accesses. We would like to come close to this minimum. While it is impossible to implement this \\"God's algorithm\\" without foreknowledge of exactly what the access sequence will be, we can define OPT(X) as the number of operations it would perform for an access sequence X, and we can say that an algorithm is dynamically optimal if, for any X, it performs X in time O(OPT(X)) (that is, it has a constant competitive ratio). There are several data structures conjectured to have this property, but none proven. It is an open problem whether there exists a dynamically optimal data structure in this model. = Splay trees = The splay tree is a form of binary search tree invented in 1985 by Daniel Sleator and Robert Tarjan on which the standard searchtree operations run in O(\\\\log(n)) amortized time. It is conjectured to be dynamically optimal in the required sense. That is, a splay tree is believed to perform any sufficiently long access sequence X in time O(OPT(X)). = Tango trees = The tango tree is a data structure proposed in 2004 by Erik Demaine and others which has been proven to perform any sufficiently-long access sequence X in time O(\\\\log\\\\log n \\\\operatorname{OPT}(X)). While this is not dynamically optimal, the competitive ratio of \\\\log\\\\log n is still very small for reasonable values of n. = Other results = In 2013, John Iacono published a paper which uses the geometry of binary search trees to provide an algorithm which is dynamically optimal if any binary search tree algorithm is dynamically optimal. Nodes are interpreted as points in two dimensions, and the optimal access sequence is the smallest arborally satisfied superset of those points. Unlike splay trees and tango trees, Iacono's data structure is not known to be implementable in constant time per access sequence step, so even if it is dynamically optimal, it could still be slower than other search tree data structures by a non-constant factor. The interleave lower bound is an asymptotic lower bound on dynamic optimality.

History These compounds are the primary components of matured magnesia cement, invented in 1867 by the French chemist Stanislas Sorel.Stanislas Sorel (1867): \\"Sur un nouveau ciment magnesién\\". Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences, volume 65, pages 102–104. In the late 19th century, several attempts were made to determine the composition of set Sorel's cement, but the results were not conclusive.Otto Krause (1873): \\"Ueber Magnesiumoxychlorid\\".

Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences, volume 94, pages 444–446. Phase 3 was properly isolated and described by Robinson and Waggaman in 1909,W. O. Robinson and W. H. Waggaman (1909): \\"Basic magnesium chlorides\\". Journal of Physical Chemistry, volume 13, issue 9, pages 673–678. and phase 5 was identified by Lukens in 1932. Properties =Solubility= The oxychlorides are only very slightly soluble in water. In the system MgO – – at about 23 °C, the completely liquid region has vertices at the following triple equilibrium points (as mass fractions, not molar fractions): : S1 = 0.008 MgO + 0.170 + 0.822 (Sol::P5) : S2 = 0.010 MgO + 0.222 + 0.768 (Sol:P5:P3) : S3 = 0.012 MgO + 0.345 + 0.643 (Sol:P3:·6) The other vertices are pure water, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, and the saturated solution (0.0044 MgO + 0.9956 by mass). =Decomposition and degradation= The anhydrous forms decompose when heated above 450-500 °C by decomposition of the hydroxide and chloride anions, releasing water and hydrogen chloride and leaving a magnesium oxide residue, by the reactions: : 2 → + : + 2 → + 2 Extended exposure of magnesium oxychlorides to water leaches out the soluble , leaving hydrated brucite .Amal Brichni, Halim Hammi, Salima Aggoun, and M'nif Adel (2016): \\"Optimization of magnesium oxychloride cement properties by silica glass\\". Advances in Cement Research (Springer conference proceedings). On exposure to the atmosphere, the oxychlorides will slowly react with carbon dioxide from the air to form magnesium chlorocarbonates. Anhydrous and partially hydrated forms also absorb water, turning into phase 5 and then phase 3 on the way to the chlorocarbonate. The exceptions are the dihydrate and hexahydrate of phase 9, that remain unchanged for many months. Structure The crystal structure of phase 3 is triclinic with space group P\\\\bar 1 and z = 2. The solid consists polymeric aquohydroxo cations, in the form of double chains of magnesium atoms surrounded and bridged by the oxygen atoms in hydroxy groups and complexed water molecules. These linear cations are interleaved and neutralized by chloride anions and some unbound water molecules, yielding the general formula []n+ ·n · n. The structure of phase 5 is believed to be similar, with generic formula []n+·n · n(4-x). The anhydrous forms of phase 3 and phase 5 have the same structure as : namely, layers of magnesium cations, each sandwiched between two layers of hydroxy or chloride anions. Phase 5 crystals form as long needles consisting of rolled-up sheets.B. Tooper and L. Cartz (1966): \\"Structure and Formation of Magnesium Oxychloride Sorel Cements\\". Nature, volume 211, pages 64–66. The Raman spectrum of phase 3 has peaks at 3639 and 3657 cm−1, whereas phase 5 has peaks at 3608 and 3691 cm−1, and brucite has a peak at 3650 cm−1. These peaks are attributed to stretching vibrations of the OH groups. Phase 3 has also a peak at 451 cm−1, attributed to the stretching of Mg–O bonds.Ronan M. Dorrepaal and Aoife A. Gowen (2018): \\"Identification of Magnesium Oxychloride Cement Biomaterial Heterogeneity using Raman Chemical Mapping and NIR Hyperspectral Chemical Imaging\\". Scientific Reports, volume 8, article number 13034. Isao Kanesaka and Shin Aoyama (2001): \\"Vibrational spectra of magnesia cement, phase 3\\". Journal of Raman Spectroscopy, volume 32, issue 5, pages 361-367. Preparation =From MgO or and = Phases 3 and 5 can be prepared by mixing powdered magnesium oxide with a solution of magnesium chloride in water , in molar ratios 3:1:11 and 5:1:13, respectively, at room temperature. This is the common method of preparing Sorel magnesia cement. Magnesium hydroxide can also be used instead of the oxide, with adjusted amount of water. For best results, the magnesium oxide should have small particle size and large surface area. It can be prepared by calcination of magnesium hydroxycarbonate ·4 at about 600 °C. Higher temperatures increase particle size leading to slower reaction rate. It is believed that, during the reaction, the magnesium oxide is continuously hydrated and dissolved, helped by the slightly acidic character of the magnesium chloride solution. The acidity is attributed to hydrolysis of the magnesium hexahydrate cations: : ↔ + The protons (which are actually hydrated, e.g. as ) make the solution acidic; the pH varies from 6.5 to 4.7 as the concentration of increases from 30% to 70% (weight basis). The protons then react with and dissolve the nearly insoluble oxide or hydroxide, by such reactions as : + 2 + 5 → : + + 4 → The ions and in solution then combine into complex cations with multiple magnesium atoms, bridged by hydroxide anions and water molecules (magnesium aquohydroxo complexes), with general formula [](2x−y)+. This process involves additional hydrolysis, turning some ligands into and freeing more , which keeps dissolving more oxide. With enough magnesium chloride, the dissolution of the oxide is relatively fast, and a clear solution of magnesium aquohydroxo cations can be obtained by filtration.H. S. Lukens (1932): \\"The composition of magnesium oxychloride\\". Journal of the American Chemical Society, volume 54, issue 6, pages 2372–2380. Over a period of several hours, those cations keep combining into larger complexes, becoming less soluble as they grow. After a few hours (at room temperature), those cations and the chloride anions precipitate as (or turn the solution into) a hydrogel, which then gradually crystallizes into a mixture of phase 3, phase 5, solid magnesium oxide and/or chloride, and/or some residual solution.Deng Dehua and Zhang Chuanmei (1999): \\"The formation mechanism of the hydrate phases in magnesium oxychloride cement\\". Cement and Concrete Research, volume 29, issue 9, pages 1365-1371. Depending on the proportion of the reagents, phase 5 may form at first, but then will react with excess chloride to form phase 3. The magnesium oxide can also react with water to form the hydroxide, which, being poorly soluble, would coat the oxide grains and stop further hydration. The acidity provided by hydrolysis of the cations in solution dissolves this coating, and thus allows the process to run continuously until one of the reagents is exhausted. =From MgO or and HCl= The compounds can also be prepared from magnesium oxide or hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. The – – phase diagram is contained in the – – diagram. =From and NaOH= The difficulties of preparing the magnesium oxide and ensuring its full reaction can be avoided by using instead of or , so that all reagents are solutions. However, sodium chloride may also precipitate for certain concentrations of the reagents. With this route, stable phase 5 precipitates in a rather narrow range of conditions, namely when the concentration [Cl] of chloride anions in solution is 2.02 ± 0.03 mol/L, the concentration [Mg] of magnesium (as and other cations) is 1.78 ± 0.07 mol/L, and the pH is 7.65 ± 0.05. Stable phase 3 precipitates in a broader range of cases, namely when [Cl] is 6.48 ± 2.17 mol/L, [Mg] is 3.14 ± 1.12 mol/L, and the pH is 6.26 ± 0.14Carmen Mažuranić, Halka Bilinski, and Boris Matković (1982): \\"Reaction Products in the System ‐NaOH‐\\".

Summary and key themes =Outdated approaches to education= In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn, Cathy Davidson suggests that breakthroughs in cognitive science should recalibrate our sense of what it means to learn. According to Davidson, those of us in higher education are paradoxically obsessed with the implications of living in the \\"digital age,\\" even though we have “yet to rethink how we need to be organizing our institutions—our schools, our offices—to maximize the opportunities of our digital era” (12). We tend to uphold models of teaching and assessments that no longer serve a generation of students who face a myriad of new challenges, as they attempt to learn to think critically in an era of information overload. Technology in all its forms is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of students. Colleges and universities, therefore, need to pay attention to the impact that the appropriate uses of digital tools can have on extending, enhancing, and enriching the student learning experience, both on and off campus. Moreover, and more importantly, Davidson argues that sustained exposure to such a range of digital media demands a different kind of attention than we previously required. =The science of attention= In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson examines the phenomenon of attention blindness: humans perceive only a fraction of everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla. Davidson argues that as a culture, our attention blindness represents a significant challenge that we must examine and meet head on; particularly since the Internet has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now. The Internet, Davidson suggests, has catapulted us into an immediate, collaborative, and interconnected existence that is characterized by the sudden breakdown of barriers between private and public, work and play, domestic and foreign, office and home, etc. Davidson notes that although our lives have been irrevocably altered in these fundamental ways, our most important educational, corporate, and social institutions have not substantially changed in correlation with these upheavals. She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded to meet the challenges of industrialization) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes. “With the Internet, we have seen dramatic rearrangements, in a little over a decade, in the most basic aspects of how we communicate, interact, gather knowledge of the world, develop and recognize our social networks and our communities, do business and exchange goods, understand what is true, and know what counts and is worthy of attention” (11). “This book starts from certain core questions: *Where do our patterns of attention come from? *How can what we know about attention help us change how we teach and learn? *How can the science of attention alter our ideas about how we test and what we measure? *How can we work better with others with different skills and expertise in order to see what we're missing in a complicated and interdependent world? *How does attention change as we age, and how can understanding the science of attention actually help us along the way?” (19-20) =Changing workplace= Technology, Davidson argues, re- shapes the way we learn and process new information in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between the ones we need to read and the ones we don't. In our work environments, we are forced to focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. > \\"When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word > for saying that something is new, strange or different. We should pay > attention to that feeling… Distraction is one of the best tools for > innovation we have at our disposal—for changing patterns of attention and > beginning the process of learning new patterns\\" =Re-imagined classroom= In addition to transforming our workplace and everyday life, Davidson argues that technology allows us a great opportunity to rethink the way we teach and organize our education system. In addition to the famous iPod experiment described earlier, Davidson suggests that gaming, blogging, self-grading, and collaborative learning are among the effective and innovative teaching tools and strategies, whose benefits outweigh those offered by the \\"one-size-fits-all model of standards that evolved over the course of the twentieth century.\\" In the chapter, \\"Project Classroom Makeover,\\" Davidson argues that the current education system is blind to the ways in which children learn and solve complex problems today, such as: creating and memorizing names and avatars of online game players, creating and writing simple codes to advance in games, searching internet for new information, and engaging with it in new creative ways. If the education system harnesses these natural curiosities through restructured curricula, it can promote creative and critical thinking and allow students to develop in their own, unique ways, rather than forcing them to fit into the standardized system of skills. As an example of a Made-Over Classroom, Davidson discusses an experimental school Quest 2 Learn. Q2L is a school whose curriculum is based on the principles of gaming. There students don't just go from class to class, completing regular assignments, they participate in quests, aimed at solving complex problems, advancing from one level to another, culminating in a final project. This model, according to Davidson, has the potential to address the needs of children who are diagnosed with learning disabilities, such as ADHD or autism, allowing them to learn in ways that focus on their individual strengths without forcing them into a standardized learning structure, which could be detrimental to their engagement and future achievements. Critical reception Davidson's Now You See It has received largely positive reviews. Publishers Weekly called Now You See It \\"critically important\\" and \\"likely to shape discussions for years to come,\\"Rev. of Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn.

In a generally positive review of Now You See It, in the journal portal: Libraries and the Academy, Andrew Battista wrote \\"As inspiring as Now You See It can be, I would say that Davidson uncritically seeks to apply the doctrines of capitalist efficiency into contemporary learning. In fact, at times her vision of education seems to verge on a kind of fluency that will prepare people to compete in a new globalized economy rather than an altruistic experience that sees learning as the preparation of any fit participant in a democracy.\\"Andrew Battista. \\"Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn (review).\\" portal: Libraries and the Academy 12.1 (2012): 104-106.

The name \\"varsity\\" was chosen in recognition of the University of Tennessee College in Martin. The building design, by the architecture firm Speight and Hibbs of Clarksville, Tennessee, incorporates elements of the Art Deco and Art Moderne styles. The exterior of the building has the streamlined appearance that characterizes Art Moderne design, including extensive use of rounded edges and horizontal lines. Art Moderne elements are also present in the interior, along with Art Deco-style lighting and wall decor. Built in the Jim Crow era, the building design provided segregated facilities for African-American moviegoers, who used a separate entrance door to get to the theater balcony and to segregated bathrooms and a drinking fountain located in the stairwell. The theater operated until 1987, then closed for several years because of its owner's health problems. It reopened in 1992, but closed in 1996, when the building was taken over for use as a church. The church moved out in 2002, and the building stood empty for several years before being converted to its current use as a fitness center and physical therapy clinic.

The aim was to form 25 kV AC overhead- wire electrified links northward from the Port of Southampton to major cities in northern and central England and a dry port container terminal in the Midlands. The government wanted efficient electric-hauled freight trains to compete with road haulage. In 2012, the spine was set to be completed within Network Rail's Control Period 5 (CP5, 2014–2019). This will not be the case, because various works were delayed, suspended for several months, moved into Control Period 6 (CP6, starting in 2019), and then scrapped altogether (despite various preliminary work, like bridge replacement, having been conducted). Other works associated with the project were to have included gauge clearance for large shipping containers and electrified connections to adjacent electrified routes, depots and freight facilities. The north–south axis of the link leads to the spine name.  Routes  A high-capacity passenger and freight corridor will run from the south coast through Basingstoke and Reading to Oxford, where it will split. One branch will run to Leamington Spa, Coventry, and the west Midlands, and another will use the re- instated East West Rail to Bletchley (Milton Keynes) for the West Coast Main Line (WCML) (to the West Midlands, north-west England and Scotland), and also onward to Bedford for the MML to the East Midlands, Sheffield and south Yorkshire.  Constituent projects  The various projects to create the spine are at different stages of development, and will be completed at different times. The initially prioritised works are fully planned and under way as part of CP5 (i.e., works for 2014–2019). Some projects will be planned and undertaken in CP5, others will be planned in CP5 for completion in the following Control Period, and some remain yet to be firmly committed to. = Initially prioritized works (2014–2019) =  East West Rail  Track doubling on the Oxford to Bicester Line in 2014. The rebuilt -long East West Rail from (via Bicester and Bletchley) to Bedford was to be electrified as an integral part of the Electric Spine. This was to include the Oxford to Bicester Line, a rehabilitated stretch of the Buckinghamshire Railway from Bicester to Bletchley (and a junction with the West Coast Main Line), and the Marston Vale Line from Bletchley to Bedford (where it meets the Midland Main Line). The Bicester to Bletchley section is to be double track with a line speed of 100 mph. This phase was due to be completed in 2019, but by August 2016, it became clear that completion of the section was no longer expected by 2019, and might even slip beyond 2024.East West Rail ‘no longer third most important project in country’ Rail Technology Magazine, 26.08.16 As of April 2015, electrification and track upgrade of the Bletchley to Bedford section was planned, but greater work on the East West Rail than that scheduled for CP5 would be needed to achieve the Electric Spine. In August 2017, the Transport Secretary announced that he had defunded electrification of the line.Electrification ‘very unlikely’ to come back into EWR scheme - Rail Technology Magazine, 25.08.17  Midland Main Line  Bridges over the Midland Main Line in Bedfordshire have been replaced to allow greater clearances for electrification and larger rolling stock. Before (top) and after (bottom) the 2014 upgrade. The electrification of the MML will be extended northward from its limit at . Bedford to Derby was originally scheduled to be electrified by 2019, but the work was \\"paused\\" in June 2015 despite significant progress having already been made. The electrification to Derby and beyond (e.g., from Trent Junction via to —completion originally due in December 2020—and also to Doncaster—originally due June 2021) will be much delayed. On 30 September 2015, the Department for Transport announced the resumption of the work with revised completion dates of 2019 for Corby and Kettering and 2023 for the line further north to Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield. . Again this was shelved in July 2017 by the Transport Secretary. Bridges and other structures have been replaced to allow space for the overhead cables and also a larger loading gauge.  Derby and Leicester station areas remodelling  Derby railway station, a junction station on the MML, received remodelled track and signalling: trains approaching from the north are segregated from those approaching from the south and west, thus removing the previous bottleneck at the station. The work was originally set for completion in December 2017, but was later pushed to summer 2018. The MML around Leicester was also being considered for capacity-improvement, but with plans being less well developed than those for Derby, and are due to be finalised in CP6.  Electrification of the Great Western Main Line and the Reading to Basingstoke Line  Catenary installation at Reading 2014Part of the planned-to-be-electrified Great Western Main Line (GWML) (from Reading to Didcot) will form part of the Electric Spine. The electrification of this part of the GWML will also include the Cherwell Valley Line from Didcot Parkway to Oxford, which was announced in 2009 as part of the 21st Century modernisation of the GWML. A freight curve at Reading bypasses the station and connects the GWML to the Reading to Basingstoke Line (14 miles), which will take the spine south to Basingstoke and onward to Southampton. The Didcot to Oxford electrification, under way and initially due for completion in 2016, was delayed indefinitely in November 2016. The Reading to Basingstoke electrification, planned as part of CP5, had no expected completion date.  Leamington Spa to Coventry line  Of the western branch of the spine from Oxford, only the Coventry to Leamington Line (9 miles) was initially prioritized for the 2014–2019 period of works. It was to have been electrified and the track doubled. However, it—along with other works—has been delayed into CP6. = Required works not scheduled for 2014–2019 = Overall, the line north from Oxford to Nuneaton is scheduled for \\"single option development\\" (the stage before detailed design) within CP6, and no completion date is given. This includes the northern part of the Cherwell Valley Line from Oxford to its junction with the Chiltern Main Line near Aynho, south of Banbury; the Chiltern Main Line from Banbury to (Oxford to Leamington: 43 miles); the Coventry to Leamington line and the Coventry to Nuneaton Line (roughly 9 miles each). The South Western Main Line, which runs 34 miles from Basingstoke to Southampton and its port, is currently third rail 750V DC electrified, and will eventually be converted to 25 kV AC overhead wires. This test-section of re-electrification will assess the feasibility of the wider conversion of the third-rail electric network to overhead wires. As mentioned above, electrification from Bletchley to Bedford is also not yet scheduled. Network Rail intends to develop plans for both projects in CP6.  Reactions  The managing director of GB Railfreight, John Smith, has questioned the prioritisation of the Electric Spine over other freight routes: \\"I [do not] really understand some of the details of the electric spine. We are reviving and electrifying a stretch of railway between Oxford and Bletchley that’s been out of use for 20 years, before we electrify across Suffolk [for access to the Port of Felixstowe], double the Felixstowe branch or deal with the Immingham approaches.\\" He stated that \\"the majority of electrification schemes in the UK [are to] support the passenger network.\\" Other freight companies' managers also have doubts in the project's benefit to freight transport given the lack of priority given to the lines to the major ports.

History  The Atlantic County Utilities Authority was formed in the late 1960s by the Atlantic County Board of Freeholders and charged with developing a comprehensive approach to wastewater management. At that time, Atlantic County had more than 20 small, outdated sewage treatment plants, most of which discharged effluent into streams, tidal waters and other surface waters. Over the years, the situation resulted in the degradation of the county's fresh water resources, estuaries and marine environments. With the construction of the Coastal Region Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1978, conditions began to improve. Since that time the system has been expanded to serve the needs of residential and commercial development throughout the county as well as demands placed by increased tourism. As a result, back bays, rivers and streams are now fit for recreational activities such as swimming and fishing. In June 1981, the Board of Freeholders designated the ACUA as the implementing agency for the Atlantic County Solid Waste Management Plan. Prior to the Freeholders’ action, trash generated in the county had been buried in 46 unlined landfills, which had become a direct threat to our groundwater resources. The Pinelands Commission required that many of these landfills be closed by August 8, 1990. These new environmental regulations, together with New Jersey's Mandatory Recycling Act, necessitated a completely new system of solid waste management in Atlantic County. Starting in 1990, the ACUA established a nationally recognized system to recycle, compost, and dispose of solid waste. A double-lined landfill, recycling center, composting site, transfer station, and ancillary facilities were built on a 360-acre site known as the Howard “Fritz” Haneman Environmental Park.  Operations  = Wastewater Division = ACUA's Wastewater Treatment Facility located in Atlantic City, NJ, currently treats the wastewater of 14 Atlantic County municipalities as well as sludge/biosolids, grease, scum, dried municipal sludge, liquid sludge and leachate from the area.http://acua.com/Wastewater/ Located at the plant is a New Jersey- certified water and wastewater environmental testing laboratory that provides analysis to ensure the treatment plant meets and exceeds environmental quality standards set by the New Jersey Department of Environmental. In addition, laboratory services are offered to public entities, including public health agencies, water utilities, wastewater utilities, and school districts. These services include water sampling and sample pick-up services.http://acua.com/wastewater/services/laboratory/ The plant operates on the power generated by the Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm and 500 kilowatt solar project located on the premises. = Solid Waste Division =  Recycling  ACUA provides recycling collection for the municipalities of Atlantic County, NJ. In 2009, ACUA implemented a single-stream recycling system, which allows residents to dispose of all recyclable materials in one container. ReCommunity Recycling operates the Materials Recovery Facility at the ACUA Recycling Center. Here, recyclables are sorted, baled and shipped to end market companies throughout the United States and internationally. ReCommunity and ACUA share in revenues derived from the sale of sorted materials.  Transfer Station and Landfill  ACUA's transfer station and landfill is located in Egg Harbor Township at its 360-acre Howard “Fritz” Haneman Environmental Park. “The landfill's first section, or cell, was constructed in 1991. Today, the landfill covers more than 100 acres and is 145 feet high. Based on current operating procedures and regulations the landfill is expected to be accepting waste through 2026. Since Atlantic County is located in a coastal area, the landfill is built above ground with a double-liner system to prevent the possibility of contamination of the environment and groundwater from waste. The landfill accepts materials such as construction and demolition debris, bulky waste and municipal solid waste. Because of its proximity to the Atlantic City Airport, ACUA landfills its municipal solid waste at night to deter the activity of birds. Metal items, including refrigerators and appliances, as well as carpeting and tires are recycled after being dropped off at the ACUA's transfer station.  Composting & EcoProducts  Yard waste that is collected at ACUA's composting facility or through municipal collections is ground up and placed into windrows – rows of material about six feet high and 500 feet long – to decompose. It is turned weekly to aid in the decomposition process and control odors. After curing for approximately six months, the material is processed and used to create ACUA's EcoSoil™.  Renewable Energy Projects  =Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm= ACUA is home to the first wind farm in New Jersey and the country's first coastal wind project, the Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm, which is located at its Wastewater Treatment Plant in Atlantic City. The ACUA partnered with Community Energy Inc. to build the farm, which consists of five turbines that can generate up to 7.5 megawatts of power. On average, the electricity produced from the wind farm satisfies about 57 to 60 percent of the Wastewater Plant's total energy needs. =Solar Energy= In partnership with World Water & Power Corporation and Alternity Power, a 500 kilowatt solar electric project consisting of 2,700 solar panels was installed at the ACUA Wastewater Treatment Plant. Built in 2005, the system is estimated to produce more than 600,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually. =Landfill Gas to Energy= A 5.4 Megawatt system landfill to gas (LFG) energy project captures methane gas, which is known to be 21 times more potent than CO2, from the ACUA's landfill and uses it to create electricity. The landfill gas project supplies 100% of the environmental park's electricity needs, with excess electricity going to the grid. The project was completed by AC Landfill Energy, LLC (ACLE), a joint venture of DCO Energy and South Jersey Industries. The LFG project generates approximately 42,638,400 KWh of electricity per year, enough energy to power 2,757 homes and offset the energy equivalent of 25,083 barrels of crude oil each year. =Green Vehicle Wash= ACUA operates a vehicle wash powered by 100% renewable energy, which is open to public and private fleets for use. Solar panels heat the wash water and solar lighting illuminates the wash bay. 85% of the water used is recycled for future washes and recycled motor oil is used to heat the facility. =Geothermal Heating and Cooling= ACUA administrative offices use a geothermal heating and cooling system. The system depends on well water that is heated at a constant temperature of 55 degrees at a depth of 250 feet. Fifty closed-looped wells on a field adjacent to the building provide the water. The system extracts heat from the water in the winter, and in summer, heat is transferred to the ground through the water.  Alternative Fuel Vehicles  =Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)= In October 2010, the first compressed natural gas station in South Jersey built and operated by Clean Energy Fuels opened at ACUA. As a member of the NJ Clean Cities Coalition, ACUA was awarded $1.9 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to offset the cost of constructing the fueling station and purchasing new CNG vehicles. ACUA is currently in the process of switching its entire fleet to CNG. =Hybrid and Electric Vehicles= ACUA operates various electric and hybrid off-road and on-road vehicles, including a zero- emission Ford Ranger EV, a solar-powered electric vehicle named “Sunny,” four hybrid Ford Escapes, a Nissan Leaf, and a Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid. Vehicles are powered at electric vehicle charging stations, which are fed by the landfill gas, solar and wind renewable energy projects.

The board took effect on July 1, 2014. Background In 2010, the newly installed UO president, Richard Lariviere, proposed establishing a new governance and funding model for UO. The New Partnership, as it became known, sought to establish an independent board and large endowment to fund the university into the future. Funding had become too low and unpredictable for UO officials, and the new model would provide the university with a consistent stream of funding and the legal freedom to borrow money for large capital projects. Lariviere's proposal called for $800 million in state bonds and \\"an equal amount\\" of private gifts. The new funds would provide a large boost to UO's then modest endowment. In a 2010 interview, UO booster Phil Knight discussed the New Partnership. Knight explained that Lariviere's plan would allow UO greater control and possibly allow it to set its own tuition for in-state students. Ultimately, the New Partnership failed. Lariviere was fired in late-2011. Neither the governance proposal or funding model was established during his presidency. On March 31, 2012, a Political Action Committee called Oregonians For Higher Education Excellence was formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle. As of May 23, 2012, the organization has raised over $320,000. Notable contributors to the PAC include, Phil Knight, Patrick Kilkenny, and Tim Boyle. According to Boyle, the PAC's stated goal was to help facilitate an increase in autonomy at the University of Oregon. Board Activity On April 14, 2015, it was announced that Michael H. Schill would become the next president of the university. This was the board's first major move since the previous president resigned. =Fundraising history= UO has initiated three capital campaigns in the last 25 years. The first campaign of this era was launched with a goal of $150 million. It ended up raising a total of $250 million between 1992-1998. The next campaign commenced its quiet phase in 2000. Campaign Oregon, as it was known, raised $853 million, far surpassing the initial goal of $600 million. The most recent campaign's quiet-phase began in 2010, and raised $700 million during this period. This campaign officially launched in November 2014, with a goal of $2 billion.

It follows real-life entertainment reporter David Farrier as he talks to \\"extraordinary\\" New Zealanders who happen to live in the same small fictional town known as \\"The Bay\\". At the time of filming, Farrier worked for TVNZ's competitor, MediaWorks. All eight episodes became available in New Zealand on 1 April 2014 through TVNZ On Demand and became available in the United States on 4 April 2014. Characters All of the Short Poppies characters David Farrier interviews are played by Rhys Darby. =Terry Pole= Terry Pole is a lifeguard who enters and reclaims the title of \\"Best Legs\\" in the local competition. He has a one-sided soulmate relationship with Georgina (played by Georgia Hatzis), is good friends with Policeman Mike (played by Jonno Roberts) and is picked on by the other lifeguards. He is oblivious to most things going on around him, unless it is to do with his legs, including Georgina telling him they are not a couple or that one of the lifeguards has a crush on him. =Steve Whittle= Steve Whittle is a ufologist and conspiracy theorist who runs an alien abduction workshop at the library. He lives with his musician girlfriend, Elise (played by Jackie van Beek) and his mother, Tessa (played by Annie Whittle) who does not like Elise. =Ron Taylor= Ron Taylor is an amateur conservationist who loves the sea and establishes a whale watching company after spotting a whale in the bay.

Her husband, Brian (played by Ray Henwood), is quiet and takes the brunt of her criticism constantly. She lived in Australia for three weeks, which was only for her sister's wedding. She treats her dead stuffed cat, Mitzy, as though it is still alive and is social media inept (she thought Twitter was the name of a drug). She frequents the Blow n Wave Salon where she catches up on gossip and scandal. While Mary comes across as oblivious (her hairdresser, Alex Turnbull (played by Karl Urban), states he \\"loves cock\\" and she states that he \\"owns a chicken farm\\"), it becomes apparent that she is aware that Alex is, in fact, gay. =Bill Napier= Bill is a Department of Conservation head ranger who may be too into nature, however he is very knowledgeable in New Zealand flora and fauna and even shows David a bear.

He and David work for NZTV. =Supporting characters= *David Farrier (played by David Farrier) plays a very similar version to his real life self.

He may be the father of Georgina's child and secretly the pair are dating. He is good friends with lifeguard Terry Pole. Towards the beginning of the series, he didn't sign a release form so his face was blurred (badly). Mid-series, he accuses David Farrier of being the cause of the trouble that has happened since their arrival.

Mushroom Records had specifically started the White Label imprint for alternative artists when signing the group. World of Stone was co-produced by the group and Tony Cohen; and reached No. 50 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart.  Background  World of Stone is a three-track extended play released by Australian rock group, Hunters & Collectors, in January 1982. The group had formed in the previous year by former members of Melbourne-based group, Jetsonnes: John Archer on electric bass; Doug Falconer on drums; Robert Miles as live sound and art director; Mark Seymour on guitar and lead vocals; and Ray Tosti-Guerra on guitar and vocals. They were joined by Geoff Crosby on keyboards; and Greg Perano on percussion (ex-True Wheels). Initially they were \\"a collective rather than a band, an excursion into funk-rock rhythms and industrial Kraut- rock\\". With early performances including \\"banging of rubbish bin lids or fire extinguishers\\". For some performances they were expanded by a horn section, later dubbed Horns of Contempt, which comprised a variable line-up including Nigel Crocker and Michael Waters, both on trombone; Jack Howard, Andy Lynn and Chris Malherbe, each on trumpet; and Jeremy Smith on French horn. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they were \\"hailed as the hip 'Next Big Thing' and the band to experience live\\". Mushroom Records specifically formed a new alternative label, White Label Records, when they signed Hunters & Collectors. The EP was co-produced by Sydney-based, Tony Cohen, and the group. In February it reached No. 50 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, with the title track also credited at the same position. The EP remained in the top 100 for eight weeks. According to Seymour, his fellow band member, Crosby, was heavily influenced by Brian Eno and used the Korg MS-20 on \\"World of Stone\\" to provide a \\"deep, almost sub sonic synth drone\\". Seymour felt that the drone, which was used on several tracks during the band's career, \\"conveys a broad limitless horizon\\".

In September 1891 the residents were agitiating to relocate the school to a location closer to where more children lived, but Queensland Government did not wish to pay for a new provisional school. In March 1892 the residents commenced the construction of a new school themselves and the Queensland Government agreed to contribute £37 to complete the building. It was renamed Wolffdene Provisional School. On 1 January 1909 it became Wolffdene State School. It closed in 1935 but re-opened 15 February 1939. It closed permanently on 31 August 1942.

He first appears in Casualty series 26 episode \\"Zero Sum Game\\", first broadcast on 7 July 2012. Fletch is originally a staff nurse in Holby City Hospital's emergency department (ED). The character is portrayed as fun, likeable, charming and a Jack the lad; he considers his family very important. Fletch's backstory states that he was a mechanic, before retraining as a nurse after the Great Recession. Researchers consulted with the Royal College of Nursing, who said the scenario was realistic. Fletch's most prominent storyline in Casualty sees him begin a \\"slow-burning\\" affair with senior nurse Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer). The characters' relationship was explored further in a special episode, \\"Mistletoe and Rum\\". Writers focused on Fletch's marriage to Natalie Fletcher (Claire Cage) as it began to dissolve and she isolates him from his children. They reconcile when Natalie gives birth. Other stories while appearing in Casualty include taking the blame for Tess' medical error, being promoted to senior staff nurse and a gambling addiction. Walkinshaw announced in April 2014 that he would be leaving Casualty to join Holby City. After saving Tess from a train explosion and having their affair exposed to Natalie and his colleagues, Fletch leaves in the series 28 episode \\"Falling – Part Two\\", first broadcast on 29 June 2014. Fletch joins Holby City in the series 16 episode \\"Star Crossed Lovers\\", first broadcast on 12 August 2014. He is appointed ward manager of the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU). His backstory connects him to Colette Sheward (Louise Delamere) as her former fiancée. Fletch's home life was explored in 2015 when he becomes a single father following Natalie's death. He struggles financially and briefly becomes involved in criminal dealings. Fletch guest appears in Casualty thirtieth anniversary episode in 2016, starting a new story where he becomes temporarily paralysed after being stabbed. Producers paired Fletch with Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) in 2017 for a long-running story, as well as creating a love triangle between him, Jac and Abigail Tait (Olivia Poulet) the following year. Further exploration of the character's background began in July 2018 when his father Steven Fletcher (Jesse Birdsall) joined the cast. Other Holby City stories include a friendship with Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden), which is tested by their feelings for Noami Palmer (Lorna Brown), clashing with Sydney Somers (Gemma Oaten) after receiving her father's inheritance, and being promoted to the director of nursing. Fletch has generally been well received by critics and fans, with Walkinshaw also receiving a nomination for Best Actor at the 2015 TV Choice Awards.  Casting  On 13 March 2012, it was announced that actor Alex Walkinshaw had joined the regular cast as nurse Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher. Walkinshaw began filming in March, which he looked forward to. Executive producer Johnathan Young expressed his joy at Walkinshaw's casting and commented, \\"He's brings bags of talent, a wealth of experience and a cheeky sense of humour to rival Fletch's!\\" Before joining Casualty, Walkinshaw starred as Dale Smith in crime drama The Bill, which also featured several Casualty cast members. Walkinshaw found this reassuring as he could rely on these people if he struggled with anything. Three actors, who were deemed suited to the part, were invited to audition for the role of Fletch. After speaking to some of the show's crew and performing a screen test, Walkinshaw was cast as Fletch. Walkinshaw was attracted to the role of Fletch because he differs from the roles that Walkinshaw has previously played. He liked the role of Fletch and his journey within the series. Walkinshaw enjoyed filming in Cardiff, where the drama is filmed. He signed a year-long contract. In 2017, Walkinshaw expressed his enjoyment at portraying Fletch and said that he did not want to leave the role. He commented, \\"I'd stay till all my hair falls out and I have a Zimmer frame.\\" The actor added that he never wanted to not enjoy portraying the character and suggested he could quit when he decides that he does not enjoy it any more. Young actor Aaron Mullen portrays Fletch in a flashback appearance during the twentieth series episode \\"Best Christmas Ever\\".  Development  = Characterisation and family = Fletch is billed as \\"the ultimate cheeky chappy\\" who enjoys sport, drinking alcohol and women. Fletch is nice, fun, charming and flirtatious. His likeable personality makes him popular amongst staff and patients alike. Walkinshaw described Fletch as \\"quite a nice, rounded bloke who's very happy to be around\\". He told Patrick McLennan of What's on TV that Fletch is a \\"wheeler-dealer\\" with the easy ability to talk to people, making him popular. On the character, series producer Nikki Wilson commented, \\"You'll see a real charm, energy and playfulness from his character, which is absolutely joyous.\\" Young's executive producer successor, Oliver Kent, said that Fletch has a \\"unique blend of warmth and blokiness\\". Walkinshaw described his character as \\"a laugh and a bit of a jack the lad\\". Jonathan Phillips, one of the show's story producers, called Fletch an \\"alpha male, laddish\\" character. A What's on TV reporter described Fletch as a \\"cheeky graduate\\" who is \\"super confident\\". Walkinshaw liked Fletch's characterisation, specifically his \\"cheeky chappy\\" persona and his occupation. He thought that Fletch would be a character that the audience could relate to. He felt that he and Fletch were similar and revelled in the opportunity to portray a friendly character. In a later interview, Walkinshaw said that he was a more serious person than Fletch as his character is very \\"high-energy, always moving\\" and he had to be more serious at home. Wilson loved the character, calling him \\"brilliant\\". Walkinshaw was handed a description of his character when he joined the series which he and producers developed after he began filming. He liked the working relationship between himself and show bosses when it came to developing the character. When filming, Walkinshaw will try to stay as his character's personality to avoid having to regain his character repeatedly. While he described this technique as \\"exhausting\\", he believed that regaining his character multiple times over the course of filming would be more tiring. Fletch is a staff nurse at Holby City Hospital's emergency department (ED), a job which he enjoys since he likes learning new skills and meeting new people. Walkinshaw thought that Fletch suited his job. Fletch wants to bring some light-hearted fun to the ED team. Fletch likes working in the hospital because it reminds him of happy memories and his family. Walkinshaw explained that although Fletch is new to the nursing profession, he has plenty of life experience, which helps him in the job. He described Fletch as \\"a very competent nurse\\" and a fantastic addition to the team of ED staff. He told a BBC Online reporter that Fletch has the \\"maturity\\" not commonly associated with recently qualified nurses. Wilson pointed out that Fletch adds \\"a real sense of humour\\" to the ED's nursing staff. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch pushes people's limits with his humour. Lisa Spencer-Blackshaw, the senior nursing advisor at Holby City, said that Fletch resembles most male nurses and opined that he is a great nurse. Fletch does not struggle when dealing with nervous and stressed patients. He will always go \\"the extra mile\\" for his patients and is described as \\"your go-to if you need straight-talking advice\\". Walkinshaw told Sue Haasler, writing for the book Holby City: Behind the Screen, that Fletch is the \\"glue between people\\" and said that he would emotionally support others as he felt it was as important as treating patients. He believed that Fletch's personal problems provide him with \\"emotional authority\\". Walkinshaw said that he struggled with the medical terminology as he is not medically capable. He practised bandaging with his children at home. He told Laura-Jayne Tyler of Inside Soap that he preferred wearing Fletch's nursing scrubs to the police uniform that he wore on The Bill. Walkinshaw believed that while he would be good at the bedside manner nurses use, he would struggle with the practical side of the job. Fletch is promoted to senior staff nurse in July 2013 and is a ward manager when he joins Holby City. A BBC Online reporter stated that Fletch's \\"executive title\\" does not prevent him from \\"getting his hands dirty and managing from the front line\\". Fletch is a good manager and is able to \\"work miracles on a dwindling budget\\". As an approachable person, Fletch knows everything about the nurses on his team. Despite his fondness of women, Fletch is loyal towards his wife Natalie Fletcher (Claire Cage), who was originally named Keila, and their three children, Evie, Mikey and Ella. Walkinshaw thought Fletch's loyalty made him \\"all the more attractive\\". He explained that Fletch enjoys flirting but also enjoys returning home to his family so would not want to betray them. Walkinshaw told Daniel Kilkelly of entertainment website Digital Spy in June 2012 that he wanted Fletch's family to be introduced on-screen. He added that he believed they would make an appearance on the show. When he joins Holby City, Fletch is billed as \\"a proud and protective single dad to four beautifully demanding kids\\". Walkinshaw told What's on TV reporter Victoria Wilson that Fletch's children are his \\"happy place\\" and they mean \\"absolutely everything\\" to him. He explained that Fletch's children give him the confidence to do what needs to be done. He added that while Fletch's decision are not always the best, they are done for good reason. = Backstory and introduction = Fletch's backstory states that he was a car mechanic running his own business until the Great Recession, when he was forced to close his garage. At the time, Fletch and Natalie were expecting their third child and needed financial support. After being supported by the nursing staff in the ED while his daughter was born at the hospital, Fletch decided that he would join the nursing profession. The show spoke to the Royal College of Nursing, who told them that many people decide to become ED nurses in later life. A BBC Online contributor dubbed Fletch \\"a little older than your average band 5 nurse\\". Fletch makes his first appearance in the twenty-sixth series episode \\"Zero Sum Game\\", broadcast on 7 July 2012. His first scenes were previewed in a promotional trailer for episodes 31-42, released on 12 April 2012. When Fletch arrives, staff nurse Lloyd Asike (Michael Obiora) is assigned to be his mentor. Fletch misses his induction with Lloyd because he is fixing clinical nurse manager Tess Bateman's (Suzanne Packer) car. Lloyd is shocked when he meets Fletch as he is expecting a young nurse who will be \\"slightly more impressionable\\". Fletch's confidence surprises Lloyd, who becomes wary of Fletch. Fletch and Lloyd treat Amy Harris (Nikki Sanderson), a young woman who is suspected to be pregnant. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch views Amy as a child and wants to be \\"supportive\\". It emerges that she is not pregnant and Fletch has to tell her some bad news, which he does not like doing. On this, Walkinshaw commented, \\"He finds that really hard and that's something he's going to have to learn how to cope with.\\" This experience helps Fletch understand that he cannot become emotionally involved in patient lives. Walkinshaw did not want to watch his first episode live as he struggles with nerves and was worried about the audience reaction. Wilson confirmed that Fletch's introduction would build towards a bigger focus on the ED's nursing staff during series 27. = Friendships = Michael Obiora (pictured) portrays Fletch's mentor, Lloyd Asike. Fletch gets along well with his colleagues, who like his fun personality. However, he clashes with mentor Lloyd. Fletch realises how humourless Lloyd is, so decides to tease him. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch's actions are not out of spite and that Fletch wants to \\"get past the seriousness of Lloyd\\". He predicted that Fletch and Lloyd would eventually become friends. When talking to his colleagues, Fletch does not differentiate between them and is not concerned about their level of authority. However, when he is working in resus, Fletch always respects the fact that the consultants are in control of the situation. Walkinshaw commented that when Fletch is in regular surroundings, \\"he's not worried whether you're the boss or not.\\" Fletch will speak to everyone in the same way because he finds that it is \\"a good leveller\\". Fletch discovers that consultant Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker) is single and questions her about it. On this, Walkinshaw explained that Fletch is only having a laugh with Zoe and is not prying for information. Walkinshaw expected Fletch to develop friendships with the characters on Holby City. He told Katy Moon of Inside Soap that Fletch would get along with all of his colleagues, similarly to his time on Casualty, as they enjoy his personality. Jaye Jacobs reprised her role as nurse Donna Jackson in June 2017 and clashes with Fletch upon her return. Jacobs and Walkinshaw previously worked together as an onscreen couple in Waterloo Road, so she dismissed any chance of romance between the pair. Before Donna left, she was the AAU's ward sister, a role which Fletch now holds. Donna struggles to be told what to do by Fletch and wants to \\"pick up where she left off\\". Jacobs explained that Donna \\"tramples on a few toes\\" as she returns. Donna returns while the hospital staff are grieving following the death of doctor Jasmine Burrows (Lucinda Dryzek). She returns with an energy that annoys Fletch; Jacobs told Sarah Deen of the Metro that Donna's energy is \\"slightly misplaced\\" and that she enjoyed portraying the tension between Fletch and Donna. However, the pair eventually establish a friendship after Donna opens up to Fletch about her personal life. = Affair with Tess Bateman = Ahead of his introduction, Walkinshaw said that Fletch and Tess would become friends when Tess becomes drawn to Fletch's humorous personality and his ability to create laughter in the ED. David Butcher of the Radio Times pointed out that Tess responds differently to Fletch than other people. He stated that when Fletch winks at Tess, she smiles at him rather than \\"[responding] with a basilisk stare and stern lecture\\". Producers devised a new storyline for Fletch and Tess when their friendship turns into an affair. Walkinshaw thought the storyline was natural and described it as an \\"honest, slow-burning development\\". The actor revealed that the storyline would feature \\"a lot of pain and struggle for Fletch and Tess.\\" Off-screen, Walkinshaw and Packer are friends and discuss their intimate scenes beforehand. He did not mind portraying them. In the months after Fletch's introduction, there is a display of \\"chemistry\\" between the two characters. Fletch and Tess' relationship is explored in a special episode, entitled \\"Mistletoe and Rum\\", made available to watch on BBC Red Button on 15 December 2012. The special follows Fletch and Tess on the ED nurses' Christmas night out. However, their evening is disrupted when they discover Tyron, a homeless man who needs emergency treatment when he goes into a hypoglycaemic coma, and have to treat him. Young thought that the special episode would create \\"an ideal opportunity\\" to explore Fletch and Tess' relationship before it began in the following months. Cast member Sarker directed the special, which she described as \\"a treat for all the fans that follow the show\\". Gemma-Leah Devereux joined the cast as \\"self-assured\\" student nurse Aoife O'Reilly in January 2013. Fletch is assigned to be Aoife's mentor and she soon develops romantic feelings for him. Fletch does not realise this so Tess tries to warn him, but he brushes off her concerns and insists that he is \\"a father figure\\" to Aoife. Tess does not approve of Fletch's behaviour around Aoife, who she deems \\"an impressionable nurse\\". Fletch realises the truth when Aoife leaves him a Valentine card and after speaking to Aoife about her actions, Fletch is forced to \\"endure a tense shift with an embarrassed Aoife and watchful Tess.\\" When Tess discovers that Fletch has spoken to Aoife, she agrees to go for a drink with him and at the end of the night, Fletch and Tess kiss. A What's on TV journalist wondered whether this would spark the start of an affair for the characters. After Tess becomes involved in a stabbing incident, she is followed home and physically threatened. Fletch predicts what may happen and goes to Tess' home, where he finds her \\"scared and emotional\\". Walkinshaw explained that at that point, Fletch and Tess realise that they have \\"strong feelings for each other\\". Fletch and Tess then have sex. Walkinshaw pointed out that it has taken the couple some time to reach this point. As part of the storyline, Fletch's home life is explored. Walkinshaw felt that this was vital for the story as it gives the audience \\"a clearer picture\\". He explained that Fletch adores his children and does not want to lose that relationship, but his relationship with Natalie is changing. Tess later discovers that she is pregnant with Fletch's child and tries to tell him before goes on holiday with his family. As she prepares to tell him in her office, Natalie arrives with his children so Tess does not get a chance to speak with him. Walkinshaw stated that the story has several \\"interesting twists and turns\\". He added that he was enjoying the story because it pairs two characters that are not expected to be paired. Tess does not tell Fletch about her pregnancy and terminates it. She avoids Fletch, but when they eventually speak, Tess ends their relationship. Zoe later realises that they have been in a relationship after noticing the tension between them at work. The following week, Natalie arrives in the ED to see Fletch but is admitted after fainting. Tess treats Natalie and discovers that she is pregnant. After Tess is admitted to the ED, Fletch discovers that she had a termination and is upset. Fletch tells Tess that he loves her, but she replies that she does not feel the same, devastating him. Afterward, Fletch decides to focus on his marriage. = Allegations = Writers created another story for Fletch when he takes the blame for Tess' medical mistake. When Tess discovers that Natalie is pregnant, she becomes \\"distracted\\" at work. She treats another patient, Peter Trenton (Graham Turner), but administers the wrong drug, leaving him \\"[fighting] for his life\\". Tess goes home, unaware of her mistake, and Fletch covers for her by replacing her initials on the notes with his. Tess is surprised to discover that Fletch made the error and he confesses that he covered for her because he blames himself for her distraction. Following the error, Fletch faces a tribunal and Tess struggles to cope, \\"distraught\\" that her actions could mean that Fletch loses his job. At the end of his shift, Fletch discovers that he has only been cautioned by the HR department. Two months later, Peter returns to the department after being admitted again. Fletch believes that Peter is being abused by his partner, Matt Marston (John McAndrew), who becomes \\"defensive\\" and accuses Fletch of attacking Peter when he was previously in hospital. Fletch admits that they spoke outside the hospital where Peter fell over, but he did not attack Peter. Matt calls the police and they arrest Fletch after reviewing the CCTV footage of their argument. The police charge Fletch with assault. On New Year's Eve, Fletch witnesses an explosion at a bar where Peter is inside and enters the burning building to save him. Paramedic Jeff Collier (Matt Bardock) helps Fletch and Peter and they escape the bar. Thankful to Fletch for saving his life, Peter drops all charges against him. = Breakdown of marriage = Writers decided to focus on Fletch and Natalie's marriage by having her discover his affair. She arrives at the ED when Fletch has to stay for an extra shift, suspecting Fletch of having an affair. Fletch reassures Natalie that they have a strong marriage, but he eventually reveals that he had an affair with a colleague, but claims that it was with a nurse who has left the hospital. Walkinshaw thought that Natalie would \\"absolutely devastated\\" if she discovered that Fletch had an affair with Tess. Natalie ejects Fletch from the family home and later warns him away from the family so he explains to his \\"heartbroken\\" children that he will not spend Christmas with them. Walkinshaw had previously teased the scenes in an interview with Inside Soap, describing them as \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"very emotional\\". He revealed that the scenes had \\"stayed with [him] for days afterwards\\". The actor added that he had \\"an inkling\\" about what the scenes would involve, but it became apparent that they were harder to film that he first thought. Walkinshaw has named the scenes as his hardest scenes to film on multiple occasions, stating that since he has children himself, he felt that it had a big impact on him. After saying goodbye to his children, Fletch is \\"overcome with regret and remorse\\". A What's on TV journalist pointed out that Fletch believes that \\"he's pretty certain life can't get any worse\\". Fletch plans to take his children out for the day and is annoyed when Natalie cancels the plans and argues with her. Walkinshaw noted that Fletch and Natalie's separation is having a strain on the children's lives, making them \\"upset and disjointed by it\\". The argument causes their daughter Evie Fletcher (Sarah Staniforth) to run away, causing \\"blind panic at her disappearance\\". Fletch goes in search of Evie and finds her in an abandoned house. When he enters the house, the ceiling collapses and Evie becomes injured and stuck. Walkinshaw enjoyed filming the on-location scenes as he liked the \\"smash and grab\\" environment in comparison to the calmer scenes in the hospital. He also liked the challenge of filming stunts as \\"big lumps of things are falling through ceilings\\". When he left Casualty, Walkinshaw said that he enjoyed this stunt as it \\"looked and sounded great\\". While Natalie is en route to the ED, she is involved in a car crash which creates worry for her unborn child. The crash makes Fletch realise that he should focus on his family and that he should not have had an affair. He and Natalie then decide to rebuild their marriage. Walkinshaw explained, \\"The tragedy of potentially losing two of their children forces Fletch and Natalie to make some big decisions.\\" Natalie decides to rebuild their marriage with support from Tess and asks Fletch to move back into the family home. Walkinshaw stated that this is \\"obviously very difficult\\" for Tess due to her feelings for Fletch. With Tess having helped the marriage, Walkinshaw thought that Natalie would feel \\"really hurt and betrayed\\" if she discovered the truth because Tess has \\"lied to her by backing up Fletch's story.\\" Natalie is later admitted to the ED in labour and Tess is forced to deliver the baby. Afterward, there are complications with the baby and Zoe has to resuscitate him. = Gambling addiction = Fletch became the subject of a gambling addiction storyline in April 2014. The storyline begins when Fletch begins having \\"playful bets\\" with registrar Caleb Knight (Richard Winsor), but he later starts online gambling. Cal then suggests to Fletch that he tries spread betting on the stock exchange, which requires a £500 starting stake. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch \\"doesn't really think it all the way through\\" so is happy to accept Cal's invitation to spread betting, despite it being too expensive for him. However, Fletch realises what he has done when he loses his money, which is one month's mortgage payment. Walkinshaw said that Fletch \\"finds himself into a bit of a pickle!\\" He explained, \\"Rather than stopping, Fletch thinks he can get out of this by spending more money. But he digs himself a deeper and deeper hole!\\" Walkinshaw teased that the storyline would not end well for Fletch. Fletch tries to earn his money back by working extra shifts at the ED, which makes him \\"exhausted\\". When Tess realises, she warns him and says he is not allowed any more overtime. Fletch then accepts a second job as a taxi driver. Walkinshaw said that Fletch has to find the lost money which leaves him under strain. He added, \\"He makes things difficult for himself and lots of other things happen.\\" Tess becomes suspicious of Fletch and he admits that he has a second job, leaving Tess \\"unimpressed\\". = Departure = On 1 April 2014, it was announced that Fletch would be leaving Casualty to join its spin-off series, Holby City. Walkinshaw stated that Fletch leaves for a new challenge after his affair with Tess is revisited. He revealed that what happens with the story means that Fletch has to leave. The executive producer of both shows, Oliver Kent, said that Fletch and Walkinshaw had been \\"a wonderful asset to Casualty\\" and he was looking forward to him joining Holby City. Walkinshaw decided to leave Casualty to be closer to his family after two years on the show. When he informed the producers, they asked him to join Holby City. He was sad to leave the show and said he would miss his colleagues, who he hoped to stay in touch with. Reflecting on his character's storylines, Walkinshaw said that he enjoyed portraying the lighter material, but also liked the \\"agonising\\" material. He added that he was happy to have filmed so many stunt scenes as nurse characters rarely leave the setting of the show. Fletch's exits in the series twenty-eight episode \\"Falling – Part Two\\", broadcast on 29 June 2014. In the episode, Tess is involved in a train crash. The train crash serves as a catalyst for Fletch's departure from the series. Phillips, who produced the episode, wanted to place Fletch and Tess' relationship at the center of the episode. He decided to create \\"a sense of what is at stake\\" for the characters. The crew struggled to find a location suitable for the train crash as many organisations did not want the show to derail trains and \\"blow them up\\" on their railways. They visited multiple locations, but most of them were not suitable for various reasons, ranging from its size to the logistics of filming there. On the stunt, Phillips said, \\"It's on an epic scale with a lot of different railway lines and we can hopefully create a real spectacle.\\" The stunt was filmed at night over several days. Walkinshaw enjoyed filming on location and film something as grand as the train crash. Phillips told a BBC Online reporter that the crew faced multiple challenges with the episode, including making sure that the script \\"really held water and did justice to the story that we really want to tell.\\" He added that once the crew realised how they would produce the episode, they became excited about filming it. Reflecting on filming the train crash, Walkinshaw commented, \\"The train crash is big, with weird and wonderful stuff – it was good fun.\\" When Fletch discovers the news, he joins the paramedics and rushes to the scene of the incident. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch \\"goes into panic\\" when he discovers that Tess in on the derailed train. He realises that he has been ignoring his romantic feelings for Tess. The train explodes as Fletch is rescuing Tess, but they appear through the smoke of the explosion. Phillips thought the image was powerful and believed the audience would remember it. While Fletch is saving Tess from the train, Natalie is watching the events on a news report in the ED. She soon realises that Tess is the woman that Fletch had an affair with. Walkinshaw pointed out that in Fletch's final scenes, he faces multiple \\"realisations\\" and \\"conclusions\\". He has to make a choice about Natalie and Tess, and ends his marriage to Natalie. Walkinshaw opined that Fletch \\"does the right thing\\" and said that he and Tess would not be able to pretend to be \\"'just' friends\\". He said in an interview for the Casualty website that Fletch is \\"brave, stupid [and] romantic\\" and commented, \\"He loves Natalie for everything she's given him: the support, the family, the love, but his heart is with Tess.\\" In an emotional conversation with Tess, he tells her that he wants them to be together, although she says that she can't be with him. Walkinshaw described the scene as \\"emotional\\" and said, \\"filming the emotional scenes with Suzanne I found quite easy to do as she's a great actress.\\" Fletch decides to resign from his job in the ED as a result. Walkinshaw that Fletch makes his decision \\"gallantly\\" and said that he does \\"the right thing\\". He did not believe his character's affair had made him a bad person as he had just acted on his feelings. He thought that Fletch deciding to leave was a selfless act because he had put Tess' feelings before his own. Walkinshaw told Elaine Reilly of What's on TV that Fletch's colleagues would \\"draw their own conclusions\\" from Fletch's decision to leave. He pointed out that Fletch has maintained a good relationship with his colleagues. Reflecting on the storyline and Fletch's departure, Phillips commented, \\"what we want to do is take the audience on a real journey with Fletch and Tess and see those characters forced to face their destinies together\\". Series producer Erika Hossington told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) that she wanted Fletch and Tess to be involved in the train crash, which she regarded as a \\"big set piece\\", because she wanted to involve characters that the audience enjoy in the stunts. Reflecting on his tenure on the show, Walkinshaw said that he could find a highlight in every day of his work and described the show as \\"a lovely place to be and work\\". He also praised his storylines and the people he's worked with, adding that he would miss the friendships he has made. He added that he liked portraying both the lighter, comedic material and the dramatic, emotional material. The actor was also appreciative for the stunts that Fletch was involved in as he understood that nurses do not usually feature outside the ED set. Phillips was disappointed that Fletch would not continue his story on Casualty, but he expected to feel the repercussions of the storyline on the show. Hossington revealed that Fletch's storyline would set up stories for Tess as she deals with the aftermath of her affair with Fletch. = Holby City introduction = Producers wanted to introduce a new male nurse that could work with Jonny Maconie (Michael Thomson) and \\"lock horns\\" with director of nursing Colette Sheward (Louise Delamere). When Walkinshaw told Kent about his intentions to leave in August 2013, he and Simon Harper, the series producer of Holby City, made plans for Fletch to join the spinoff series. Kent explained that this very rarely happens and when it does, they do not normally move to the other show immediately. However, he thought that Fletch was \\"unique\\" in how there was a small gap between leaving Casualty and joining Holby City. Harper thought that moving Fletch to Holby City would be risky due to his association with Casualty. Despite this, he felt that Walkinshaw brought \\"cheek and charm\\" to the show, which he liked. Walkinshaw was surprised by the plans to move his character, but said he was \\"very grateful for it\\" as it meant he could go home each night. On this, he commented, \\"There's a lot to be said for that.\\" Walkinshaw did not know many cast members before joining the show, but did know Rosie Marcel, who portrays Jac Naylor, well as they worked closely together on The Bill. Writers devised a scene between Walkinshaw and Marcel where they reference their history on The Bill. Marcel felt \\"lucky\\" to be allowed to have a scene and described the scene as \\"really funny\\". She was pleased that Walkinshaw had joined the cast as she had tried to get him to join for several years and expected him to attract a new audience for the show. When Walkinshaw told Marcel that he would be joining, she joked that she would \\"make [his] life hell!\\" A preview of upcoming episodes, including Fletch's introduction, was released on 15 July 2014. With the announcement that Fletch would join Holby City, Walkinshaw stated that after leaving his job in the ED, Fletch is offered a new job in the hospital. He is offered the position of the ward manager of the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU) after Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden) complains to Colette about a lack of nurses. CEO Guy Self (John Michie) takes over the decision and hires Fletch without telling Colette. Kent and Harper agreed that Fletch's introduction allows for the AAU to become \\"fun again\\". Fletch's new job is a promotion. Walkinshaw said that Fletch would try to be successful and \\"assert himself a bit more\\" as he becomes more mature. He added that Fletch would take on the responsibility as a challenge, but said that he could \\"mess up\\" like he did on Casualty. Walkinshaw did not expect Fletch's gambling storyline to be continued in Holby City. He also pointed out that Fletch is not in a relationship so could have a love interest. When asked about Fletch's upcoming storylines, Walkinshaw teased stories with Colette, Raf, Harry Tressler (Jules Knight) and Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell). Since both shows are set in the same hospital, it is expected that characters may know each other. Therefore, Fletch's new colleagues know about his affair with Tess. His superiors, Guy and AAU consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) warn Fletch not to mix his personal and professional lives in his new job. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch expected people to doubt him in his new job and is prepared to \\"rise to the challenge and move on\\". Ric already knows Tess, which makes him more cautious of Fletch. Walkinshaw said that when he joins the AAU, \\"Fletch's card is well and truly marked.\\" However, Ric becomes impressed with Fletch when he performs a difficult procedure. Fletch tries to prove himself by hiring an agency nurse to help with the workload. Helen Flanagan was cast as Kirsty Brompton, a \\"lazy and wily\\" agency nurse who Fletch hires after meeting her in a bar. Kent stated that Flanagan's appearance would be \\"an episode to watch\\" and that Kirsty would \\"ruffle some feathers\\" with Colette. Colette disagrees with Fletch's decision to hire Kirsty, believing that he has hired her based on her appearance rather than her skills. When the AAU becomes understaffed, Fletch tries to hide this and sort the ward single-handedly, but Colette soon realises the truth. = Colette Sheward = Writers established a link between Fletch and Colette when it emerges that they were engaged fifteen years previously, but she jilted him on their wedding day. Delamere explained that Colette jilted Fletch because she wanted to explore other things before settling down. The pair have \\"unresolved issues\\" which make Fletch's new job difficult. Delamere explained that Fletch would be \\"an unwelcome blast from the past who gets under Colette's skin!\\", while Walkinshaw teased that Fletch would have to decide how to create a working relationship with Colette. Guy hires Fletch to annoy Colette, which Fletch fails to realise. Delamere thought that Guy's actions were cruel for Colette. Colette realises Guy's intentions and reacts badly to Fletch's arrival. Fletch hopes for a \\"fresh start\\" when he arrives, but struggles with this when he is confronted with Colette. Their meeting is the first time that they have seen each other since Colette jilted Fletch on their wedding day. Walkinshaw told Wilson (What's on TV) that although Fletch and Colette need to have a talk about that day, Fletch wants to get on with his job. He also said that \\"it's a bit of a shock to both of them\\" to see each other and there is clear tension between the pair. The actor explained that Fletch decides to deal with his past with Colette and develop a better working relationship with her, but encounters a lot of \\"bickering and banter\\". Walkinshaw enjoyed the fun scenes between Fletch and Colette where they argue. A romantic attraction is developed between Fletch and Colette. Walkinshaw told Kilkelly of Digital Spy that there is an element of \\"what if?\\" between Fletch and Colette. Delamere thought there was \\"great chemistry\\" between the pair, but understood that Colette needed to be professional. Despite this, the actress opined that Colette should have married Fletch. Colette departed the series in November 2014, ending any potential relationship between Fletch and Colette. Delamere enjoyed working with Walkinshaw and believed that had Fletch and Colette began a relationship, Colette would have \\"ended up eating him alive if she'd wanted to!\\" = Raf di Lucca = Producers developed a friendship between Fletch and registrar Raf di Lucca (McFadden) when he joins Holby City. Moon (Inside Soap) reported that Fletch and Raf would become \\"firm friends\\". Walkinshaw told her that they would work well together and support each other. McFadden also confirmed that Fletch would become friends with Raf and said that during Raf's difficult moments, Fletch becomes \\"a guiding light for him\\". When Raf confides in Fletch about his marital problems, Fletch agrees to help Raf. He assigns him to a complex case and encourages Raf to focus on his career. McFadden enjoyed working with Walkinshaw and opined that he was enjoyable to spend time with. Reflecting on Fletch and Raf's friendship, Walkinshaw pointed out that Fletch has made Raf more light-hearted, while Raf has matured Fletch. Fletch and Raf's friendship is tested in May 2016 by the introduction of psychiatrist Naomi Palmer (Lorna Brown). Fletch tries to impress Naomi and decides to ask her on a date, presuming that Raf will babysit his children. Raf becomes irritated by Fletch's behaviour and feels that he is \\"being taken for granted\\". He reminds Fletch about his responsibilities at home and Fletch realises how much he needs Raf. Raf later develops an attraction to Naomi as Fletch decides to ask Naomi on a date. Naomi later dumps Fletch without warning after developing an attraction to Raf. Raf feels guilty and tries to hide his feelings for Naomi, although Fletch soon realises. He tells Raf that he will move out of his house, although he changes her mind when they reconcile. McFadden left the series in 2017 and Raf was killed off in a hospital shooting in December. Fletch struggles to grieve for Raf following his death. A few weeks later, Fletch is sent Raf's record collection as part of his inheritance. A patient then suggests that Raf wants Fletch to complete and order the collection, which he continues to do. = Single fatherhood and poverty = Fletch's first major storyline in Holby City commenced in January 2015 when his and Natalie's divorce is finalised. Natalie celebrates her divorce with her friend Bex Kimber (Emma Cooke) and they arrive on the AAU, where Fletch is on shift, after Bex is admitted. Natalie reveals that she is moving to Sunderland with their children, having accepted a job there. Fletch is annoyed and speaks to Bex, who explains that Natalie is \\"deeply unhappy as a result of their marriage breakdown\\" and needs to start afresh. Fletch then realises how much his affair with Tess has affected Natalie and tells her that he will not stop her moving. Natalie falls unconscious and Raf realises that Natalie has serious bruising on her head. It emerges that Natalie has a bleed on the brain and needs emergency surgery; Fletch is left \\"in turmoil\\". Natalie dies as a result of her injuries, leaving Fletch a single father. The divorce left Fletch without any savings so when he becomes a single father, he is left with financial strain. Producers decided to kill off Natalie because it would create several new storylines for Fletch, including his struggle as a single father and his financial struggles, which were shown onscreen. Evie Fletcher (Macey Chipping), Fletch's eldest daughter, was introduced in April 2015 as part of the storyline. As she joins a new school, Evie is involved in a bus crash and admitted onto the AAU. Fletch orders an MRI scan for Evie when she says that she has a headache, panicking that she could have a brain injury like Natalie. Fletch is then devastated when he discovers that Evie was not involved in the accident and that she was being bullied for being poor, so got off the bus early. Evie confesses that she did not want to worry Fletch, which makes him realise that Evie is aware of his financial struggles. A What's on TV reporter stated that Fletch \\"feels he's letting his children down\\". Later, Fletch has to pay for an expensive school trip for Evie amid multiple debts. Jane Hazlegrove, who portrays Kathleen \\"Dixie\\" Dixon in Casualty, appears in one episode as part of the storyline. When a patient suggests that Fletch bets on a horse, he asks Dixie to place the bet for him so he can pay for Evie's trip. Dixie is \\"reluctant\\" due to Fletch's gambling problem. Fletch's debts increase when his car is clamped after parking illegally to help a patient. Fletch confesses his financial problems to porter Clifford George (Geff Francis), who becomes a friend for Fletch. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch relates to Clifford as he is a \\"bloke's bloke\\" and is trying to help Fletch. He added that Clifford has \\"no malice\\" towards Fletch. Clifford has the clamp removed and offers Fletch \\"a holdall of knocked-off cigarettes\\" for him to sell. Fletch is hesitant to accept, but does take Clifford's offer. However, Walkinshaw believed that these actions are \\"not really Fletch\\". Clifford continues to help Fletch with his problem and they store illegal whiskey in the hospital. They discover a young boy where they have stored the alcohol, and Serena nearly discovers their stash. Clifford later tells Fletch about a pharmaceutical drugs raid from a delivery van and claims that it is a \\"victimless crime\\", but Fletch is not interested. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch justifies the raid because Clifford has said that nobody would get hurt. Writers included an \\"awful\\" and \\"really sad\\" twist to Fletch's financial storyline when he and his children are evicted from their home. On the twist, Walkinshaw commented, \\"Fletch is the sort of person who cheers everyone else up when the truth is that inside he's dying.\\" He added that Fletch feels like he has failed his children. When Fletch arrives to work with his belongings, Clifford offers Fletch the chance of assisting in the raid. Walkinshaw said that Fletch is hesitant to get involved in the raid because he is \\"a decent, honest man\\" and the raid does not feel right to him. However, he pointed out that Fletch has no other choice but to get involved as he has to support his children. At the end of the day, Fletch and his children have to sleep in \\"makeshift beds\\" in the hospital basement. Victoria Wilson (What's on TV) opined that Fletch had \\"hit rock bottom\\". When Clifford explains to Fletch what he has to do, Fletch gets anxious and tries to end his involvement. Walkinshaw told Wilson that Fletch ends his involvement because he is uncomfortable with becoming a criminal. Clifford confesses how he owes money to \\"violent drug dealers\\" and he needs to repay them, before revealing that they know about Fletch and his children, placing their lives at danger. Fletch panics that his children are in danger, so agrees to help. However, when Fletch's patient deteriorates, he cannot attend the raid. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch \\"made the right call at the wrong time\\". Shortly afterward, a woman is found \\"badly beaten\\" outside the hospital entrance and Fletch believes the two incidents are connected. On Fletch's reasons for this, Walkinshaw commented, \\"there's no such thing as a victimless crime; somebody always gets hurt, somebody always pays.\\" A further twist to the story revealed that the beaten woman is healthcare assistant Adele Effanga (Petra Letang). Fletch is \\"racked with guilt\\" from the attack, knowing he is partly responsible for Adele's condition. He asks Clifford to anonymously tell the police the name of a gang member, but Clifford refuses, so Fletch warns Clifford to sort the situation or he will. Clifford then leaves the hospital without telling anyone. A What's on TV reporter said, \\"it's anyone's guess whether we'll see him again...\\" Realising what Clifford has done, Fletch confesses the truth to Adele's cousin Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu), who warns that she go to the police if Fletch does not leave Holby in one month. Clifford later returns to the hospital when he is injured in a car accident and Mo does not force Fletch to leave. Fletch and his family are also invited to live with Raf when he discovers they are homeless. Walkinshaw explained that Raf has \\"taken a lot of weight off [Fletch's] shoulders\\" by inviting them to live with him. He observed, \\"It's not a conventional family unit, but it suits them both.\\" Fletch's single parenthood was explored again in August 2016 when Fletch's children, Evie and Mikey Fletcher (Kai O'Loughlin), appear in the series. Evie is admitted as a patient on the AAU and Mikey arrives shortly afterward. Fletch has to face Mikey's \\"problematic behaviour\\" and worries that \\"what taking his eye off the ball could mean for his family.\\" It emerges that Mikey hurt Evie by pushing her down the stairs. As Evie prepares to be discharged, she tells Serena that she does not want to return home. Fletch also tells Serena that he blames himself for the accident so she reunites Fletch and Evie. Walkinshaw enjoyed working with Chipping and O'Loughlin. He described Chipping as \\"extraordinary\\" and \\"such a lovely actor\\", and O'Loughlin as \\"a little Fletch on a hot wash.\\" Walkinshaw joked, \\"All we've got to do is grow that hair and tease that quiff and he's me.\\" O'Loughlin lives very close to where Walkinshaw was raised and the three actors bonded immediately. The younger actors have conversations with Walkinshaw about trying different methods in their work, which Walkinshaw encourages. Walkinshaw explained that he made a big effort to create a connection between them. He called the actors \\"adorable\\" and a delight to work with, commenting, \\"If I could work with them all the time it would be lovely.\\" = Casualty return and paralysis = After leaving Casualty, Walkinshaw said that he could return to the show for guest appearances or that characters from the show could appear in Holby City. The actor thought it would be good to appear in some episodes. Plans for Casualty thirtieth anniversary were first announced in 2015 by series producer Erika Hossington, and on 28 June 2016, it was announced that a \\"dramatic and shocking stunt\\" would air on 27 August for the show's anniversary. It was also announced that Walkinshaw would reprise his role as Fletch for the episode, alongside two other Holby City cast members. Fletch appears at a surprise party for senior nurse Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson), who is celebrating thirty years in the NHS. Bernie Wolfe, portrayed by Jemma Redgrave (pictured), felt guilty for Fletch being stabbed. On 27 August 2016, it was confirmed that the episode's aftermath would be explored in the following Holby City episode, \\"Protect and Serve\\" and that Fletch would be a key character in the episode. In terms of production, the episode is a standalone episode and was filmed out of order from other episodes. In the episode, Fletch struggles to manage the wards following the crash and has to treat Steph Sims (Tonicha Lawrence), the \\"unstable\\" woman who caused Fletch's former colleague Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) to drive her car off the edge of a cliff. Fletch is also treating James Fielding (Kirk Barker), a patient who is obsessed with consultant Bernie Wolfe (Jemma Redgrave). When Fletch notices James' erratic behaviour, he suggests a psychiatric appointment, but Bernie disagrees. James and Steph disappear from the ward and Fletch discovers them in the basement with James threatening Steph with a screwdriver. As Fletch tries to calm him down, James accidentally stabs Fletch in the stomach. Fletch is taken to theatre, where Serena and Bernie save his life. Afterwards, Bernie confides in Serena that she blames herself for Fletch's condition. When asked why Fletch had suffered so much, Walkinshaw replied that it made for more entertaining storylines. He continued, \\"It is hard, but it shows good strength of character every time he has to pick himself up again.\\" Walkinshaw thought it was realistic for so many bad things to happen to Fletch, but expected that something good would happen to him eventually. Harper explained that because Fletch is an \\"everyman\\" and a character who \\"the audience are always rooting for\\", it works when several bad things happen to him. He joked that Fletch had become a \\"punch bag\\" on the show. Writers planted a \\"worrying twist\\" in the story when Fletch's blood pressure drops as doctors attempt to wake him from his coma. However, when doctors try to awake Fletch again, he successfully awakes. Raf then takes over Fletch's care. Walkinshaw explained that Fletch and Raf's friendship is that close that Raf wants to do anything he can to save Fletch. Fletch's health deteriorates and he falls from his bed and injures himself. As a result, Fletch cannot feel anything in his legs and feet, leaving Raf \\"alarmed\\". Raf and Bernie then perform a lumbar puncture on Fletch and he is \\"terrified\\" when he cannot feel the needle. Walkinshaw told Wilson (What's on TV) that Fletch panics that he could die and his children would be parentless. Fletch then asks Raf to care for his children if he dies. Walkinshaw described the moment as \\"emotional\\" and opined that it is \\"lovely that two 'blokey' men can be that close and honest with each other\\". Raf promises to care for the children, but tells Fletch that he will save his life. Walkinshaw had to lie in bed for most of the story as Fletch was unable to move. He found himself falling asleep between takes as he was still in the bed. The actor felt that being in bed helped him realise how frustrating it would be for Fletch and let his \\"emotions wash over [him] and come out of [him].\\" Walkinshaw found working with his co-stars helpful as he could use their performance to boost his performance. He explained that when some actors give a powerful performance for their close-up, but fail to maintain this emotion for his close-up, he can struggle to perform to his best ability. Raf eventually diagnosis Fletch with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but when he treats Fletch for this, the nurse suffers from anaphylactic shock. Walkinshaw stated that Raf's treatment almost kills Fletch. As Fletch continues to recover from his paralysis, he begins physiotheraphy and manages to walk a few steps. However, Fletch tries to do too much and falls, dislocating his shoulder and knocking patient Jay Nevin (Cassidy Little) unconscious. As Jay has a seizure and starts foaming at the mouth, Fletch is forced to help him as he cannot reach the call button. Fletch \\"hoists\\" himself from his bed and lays next to Jay, stopping him choking and shouting for help. The aftermath of Fletch's stabbing was filmed before the actual stabbing as it was part of the standalone episode. Because of this, Walkinshaw was required to remember multiple scripts at once while pretending not to know about following episodes onscreen. Series production manager Ali Liddle thought that it was \\"quite a discipline for [him] to remember\\". Walkinshaw reprises his role in Casualty again during its thirty-third series for a two-part crossover episode with Holby City, originally broadcast in March 2019. He returned for another episode during the series, originally broadcast on 13 April 2019. Fletch appears when Charlie reports nurse David Hide (Jason Durr) to him for assault. In the previous episode, David pushes Charlie to the floor in defence after he repeatedly aggressively shoves him. Durr explained that David finds the situation \\"distressing\\". = Inheritance = In December 2016, Nicholas Woodeson was introduced as \\"cheeky yet vulnerable patient\\" Artem Chernik, who is a former professional poker player. Artem returns after being admitted following a collapse at the airport. Fletch discovers that he was travelling to see his long-lost daughter and decides to find her. Fletch manages to find Artem's daughter, but she refuses to have contact with him. Artem is later admitted to the AAU again, where he reveals that he won a large amount of money at the casino the previous night. Fletch is \\"gobsmacked\\" when Artem reveals he is carrying his winnings in cash. When it is discovered that Artem needs a life-threatening operation, Fletch manages to get him a less risky operation. After much deliberation, Artem agrees to the surgery, but he dies in theatre, leaving Fletch gutted. After learning about Artem's death, Fletch discovers that Artem changed his will and testament before surgery and that he has left everything, including his winnings, to Fletch. Fletch then decides to repay everyone who he has ever borrowed money from. However, a patient makes him realise that he should spend some of the money on himself. Walkinshaw enjoyed working with Woodeson, who he described as \\"a proper heavyweight\\", and would often find himself chatting with him in between takes. He believed that their friendship enabled the characters to portray the chemistry that was wanted for the scenes. On 13 December 2016, it was announced that Emmerdale actress Gemma Oaten would make a guest appearance in the show. Her appearance as Sydney Somers was previewed in a show trailer released in March 2017. It was teased that Sydney would \\"cause a world of trouble for Fletch due to her connection with someone close to him.\\" Laura-Jayne Tyler of Inside Soap confirmed that Oaten would play an agency nurse who believes that Fletch has money that belongs to her. She added that Sydney would be \\"fiercely determined to get her hands on it!\\". Oaten told Tyler that she enjoyed filming with Walkinshaw and learnt a lot from him. Sydney first appears in April 2017. She arrives on the ward as Fletch has \\"an upbeat outlook on life\\", which Sydney manages to destroy throughout the day. As Fletch finds out more information about Sydney, he is \\"dumbstruck\\" to discover that she is Artem's daughter. Sydney then threatens Fletch with legal action over a claim to Artem's inheritance. Fletch is surprised when Sydney reappears on the AAU the following week. Oaten told Kayleigh Giles of the Daily Express that Fletch is \\"absolutely gobsmacked\\" when Sydney returns as he thought she had no more shifts at the hospital. As Fletch prepares to go on holiday with his family, he questions whether he deserves the inheritance. Producers invited Oaten to reprise her role for a guest appearance in 2018. Sydney returns in a new position. In August 2017, Fletch is promoted to the Director of Nursing, a managerial role in the hospital. As part of the position, Fletch has to deal with nurse shortages. He arranges a meeting with the head of agency staff, who is revealed to be Sydney. Fletch and Sydney clash when he asks for her agency nurses to work for 30 minutes unpaid and she refuses. Annoyed, Fletch says that the hospital will not use their nurses any more, but when Abigail Tait (Olivia Poulet), the hospital's chief executive officer, discovers this, she is \\"furious\\" with Fletch. Another incident then forces Abigail to question whether Fletch suits the role of Director of Nursing. However, Fletch and Sydney manage to compromise over the agency staff and he asks her to join him for a drink after work. = Jac Naylor and Abigail Tait = In an August 2017 interview with Digital Spy, series producer Kate Hall revealed that she had paired Fletch with Jac Naylor, the director of cardiothoracics, for a new storyline as she thought that they had a \\"palpable\\" connection. She billed the pairing as \\"delicious and electric\\" and compared it to Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd in Moonlighting or Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. On the comparison, Marcel told Laura-Jayne Tyler, writing for Inside Soap, that she loved playing the Moonlighting aspect of the relationship and that Walkinshaw would be Shepherd to her Willis. Hall confirmed that the storyline would begin on 29 August and teased that the storyline would see Jac \\"let her guard down\\" as she starts to grieve for her sister Jasmine. Hall added that the performances between Walkinshaw and Marcel were \\"mind-blowing\\" and that it was clear that they had \\"a really strong connection\\". In the aforementioned episode, Fletch attends an interview for the Director of Nursing position, but finds himself a \\"real-life managerial challenge\\" when he has to find a theatre for a patient. Fletch asks Jac if she will operate on his patient urgently. Fletch receives the promotion to Director of Nursing and is moved to Darwin ward. Walkinshaw hoped that with his promotion, Fletch could \\"bring a bit of normal-speak to the boardroom, something we can understand.\\" Walkinshaw pointed out that Jac is a completely person to Fletch and noted that Jac is used to telling a man off as he stands opposite her desk and reminding them who is in charge. Walkinshaw thought the pairing would be \\"interesting\\" as Jac is very formidable and Fletch is not afraid to challenge her. He hoped for clashes between the pair as well as some nicer scenes. Fletch serves as a \\"loyal friend\\" to Jac and she helps him when he struggles with the hospital's winter crisis. In February 2018, Fletch and Jac's relationship is explored again. When Fletch receives a vinyl collection in Raf's will, Jac takes a \\"rare\\" vinyl record. Fletch does not realise and decides to buy the record. Jac's mentee, Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori), and daughter, Emma Naylor-Maconie (Darcey Burke), soon realise that Jac has developed feelings for Fletch. Fletch, who is struggling in the wake of the recent hospital shooting, installs extra security measures in the hospital. However, the measures result in a bike courier, who has delivered a replacement record to Jac, being admitted to Darwin ward. Fletch has also been \\"snooping\\" on Evie's phone, which Jac warns him about. She helps Fletch and Evie bond. Fletch and Jac later arrange a date to the zoo with their children. However, they have to cancel when there is a shortage of staff at the hospital. As Fletch assists Jac in surgery, he discovers that she planned to leave Holby before the shooting. He questions why she didn't leave. A What's on TV reporter thought that it was \\"obvious [that] Jac has eyes for Fletch\\". Jac is told that she has four weeks of holiday available to take and despite her growing feelings for Fletch, she leaves. Abigail Tait (Poulet), the hospital's new CEO, is introduced in April 2018. She clashes with Fletch over the care of a patient as he struggles in the absence of Jac. Fletch accuses Abigail of undermining patient care to \\"put herself on the map\\", so Abigail warns Fletch and defends her actions. When Fletch and Abigail clash again over patient care, he questions the CEO's intentions. Abigail later tasks Fletch with choosing a new senior staff nurse for the AAU. He wants Donna to take on the role, but Abigail wants to go through an interview process, causing them to argue. A What's on TV journalist observed that \\"Fletch and Abigail rub each other up the wrong way\\" in the episode. Abigail felt bad for her actions and asked Fletch to go for a drink after work. They chat and realise that they should work together. Jazmin Duribe of the Daily Star pointed out that there was \\"obvious chemistry\\" between the pair and suggested that Fletch could \\"replace\\" Jac with Abigail. When Fletch and Sydney disagree over the agency staffing problem, Abigail warns Fletch to fix the problem and later suggests he is not suitable to his job. Fletch later has sex with a \\"mystery hot blonde\\" woman, who is revealed to be Abigail in a \\"shocking twist\\", despite his involvement with Jac. Marcel revealed in an Inside Soap interview that she and Walkinshaw did not want to be paired together as they felt that the characters would not suit. She hoped that they would not share a kiss and compared it to \\"snogging my brother!\\" After an extended period of leave, Jac returns to the show in June 2018. Fletch is shocked to see Jac back at the hospital. Marcel thought that it was \\"obvious\\" that Fletch had missed Jac and thought that it was nice. On Fletch and Jac's relationship, the actress commented, \\"Fletch suffers her and she knows he suffers her\\". She also told Tyler (Inside Soap) that Jac does not want to burden Fletch with her problems as she is a \\"complicated soul\\". However, it is soon revealed that Jac has not returned for Fletch, but for an urgent operation, which Fletch does not agree with. They share a heart-to-heart as Jac confides in Fletch over her feelings towards her health. Following Jac's return, Fletch and Abigail's relationship is challenged, and they realise their feelings for each other. After a heavy focus on Fletch and Abigail's relationship, his immediate relationship with Jac is revisited in August. When an agency nurse does not arrive for an operation that Jac is leading, she orders Fletch to assist her in theatre, but he is distracted by his personal life. This leads to the pair having a \\"blazing row\\". As Fletch goes to reconcile with Jac, he discovers her unconscious and \\"raises the alarm\\". = Introduction of father = A promotional trailer, displaying upcoming scenes in the show, was released on 5 June 2018. The trailer revealed that Fletch's father would be introduced to the series. Inside Soap confirmed the news, reporting that Jesse Birdsall had been cast as Fletch's estranged father, Steven Fletcher. They stated that there would not be a happy reunion for father and son and revealed that Fletch would stop Steven from seeing his family. Fletch's father was previously mentioned in December 2016 when he contacts Fletch after multiple years without contact. Steven arrives as Fletch is experiencing \\"an emotionally exhausting day\\". Fletch has to leave Evie in charge of his youngest child, Theo Fletcher (Stanley Rabbetts), while he goes to work. However, when Theo is admitted alone onto the AAU with a broken finger, Fletch starts to worry and is told that social services will be getting involved. Evie arrives at the hospital with Steven, who Fletch is shocked to see, having not seen him for 17 years. Fletch tries to send Steven away, but he and Evie bond as Steven fixes Fletch's car. Annoyed that Fletch won't let Steven stay, Evie reminds Fletch of his misdemeanours as a parent, including his affair with Tess. Fletch then agrees to let Steven meet his children, although Haasler, writing for the Metro, thought that Fletch still appeared \\"extremely wary\\" about Steven. Social services later inform Fletch that he can keep his children, but will have to attend a parenting course and that he will be \\"monitored\\" by social services.  Reception  Walkinshaw was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" at the 2015 TV Choice Awards. Fletch's poverty storyline was shortlisted at the 2016 Inside Soap Awards under the \\"Best Drama Storyline\\" category, but lost out to Arthur Digby's (Rob Ostlere) death. Walkinshaw was nominated for Best Drama Star at the 2020 Inside Soap Awards. David Butcher of the Radio Times branded Fletch \\"a cheeky nurse keeping up the jack-the-lad quota now Lennie [sic] has left.\\" Tyler (Inside Soap) described Fletch as \\"gorgeous\\". A What's on TV reporter called Fletch \\"a good nurse but 'a lousy husband'. On Fletch, a columinst from What's on TV commented, \\"As ward manager of Holby's AAU, Adrian 'Fletch' Fletcher is dedicated to his job, running a tight ship at work while raising four kids as a single dad.\\" Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy thought that Fletch and Tess' affair was his biggest storyline in Casualty. Tyler (Inside Soap) said that Fletch and Tess' affair had been \\"a huge talking point\\". Wilson (What's on TV) dubbed Fletch a \\"love-rat\\" and observed that Fletch had \\"caused quite a stir on the ED\\". Walkinshaw received a mixed response to Fletch and Tess' affair, commenting, \\"It's like Marmite – people either love it or hate it.\\" Walkinshaw received a positive reaction the news he was moving to Holby City with some Casualty fans deciding to start watching Holby City as a result of the move. While the actor predicted some bad response, he told Wilson (What's on TV) that he had received a good response to his departure, with some viewers opining that Fletch and Tess could have stayed in a relationship. Producer Harper thought that Fletch's transition to Holby City had played out excellently and called Fletch a \\"fantastic\\" character. He added that Walkinshaw had become a \\"great company member, one of the gang on screen and off.\\" Delamere revealed that Fletch and Colette's relationship had been well received by fans of the drama. Wilson of What's on TV sympathised with the character, commenting, \\"as if he hasn’t been through enough in his life, he recently got stabbed by a patient\\". She also described Fletch asking Raf to care for his children if he dies as \\"heart-breaking\\". Walkinshaw also received positive feedback to his onscreen chemistry with Woodeson (Artem Chernik). Multiple members of Holby City cast and crew told Haasler for her Holby City book how good Walkinshaw is on the show, especially with how he works with the camera.

He fought during the Battle of Britain and was a flying ace of the Second World War, scoring 8 victories. Following his retirement from the RAF as a wing commander in 1965, Allen wrote several controversial books and articles on air power. He criticised RAF Air Staff policies before and during the Second World War. In contrast to the conventional narrative account, he maintained that during the Battle of Britain naval rather than air power was the crucial factor. His opinions clashed with mainstream opinion of the RAF's role, and with the views of many air historians, but his viewpoint received some support and significant attention. Career =Second World War= Allen was commissioned into the Royal Air Force in 1939, the outbreak of war curtailing life as an undergraduate at Cardiff University where he was reading Economics. After training, he joined No. 66 Squadron RAF in mid-April 1940. Originally part of Fighter Command's No. 12 Group covering the Midlands and East Anglia, No. 66 Squadron took part in the air battles over the Dunkirk evacuation. During the Battle of Britain, the squadron joined No. 11 Group at Kenley for a week and later served at Gravesend, West Malling and Biggin Hill. Allen had seven confirmed kills and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.Obituary, Times, 1987 His nickname, \\"Dizzy\\", reflected his ability to escape a tight situation by executing an aerobatic flat-spin. He was shot down and wounded on a number of occasions, once by the well-known Luftwaffe ace Werner Molders and again as a result of an air-to-air collision with another RAF pilot. In 1978, Allen recorded his experiences as a combat pilot for a BBC programme in which he expressed high praise for his fellow pilots and ground staff but was critical of the radar controllers and the higher echelons of the RAF. His attitude towards those pilots who refused combat was harshly uncompromising, though such feelings were not uncommon at this time. After the Battle of Britain, he became No. 66 Squadron's commander squadron commander at age 21, succeeding Athol Forbes, with whom he later collaborated in writing, Ten Fighter Boys: 66 Squadron RAF, a collection of first hand accounts of participants originally published in the middle of the war (1942). Allen described his time with No. 66 Squadron in Fighter Squadron 1940–1942. Later in the war he became Air Advisor to the 1st Airborne Division and then Tactics and Gunnery Officer to No. 12 Group. =Post-war service= Post-war, he commanded a squadron of Gloster Meteor jet fighters. He was Air Defence Advisor to the Dutch Government for three years, and was awarded the Order of Orange-Nassau. Allen was a skilled pilot having moved from piston engine propeller-driven fighters to the newer generation of jets including the English Electric Lightning, which had a speed exceeding 1,000 mph. He planned the RAF's coronation flypast over the Queen's balcony at Buckingham Palace in 1953. During the later Queen's Coronation Review, he arranged for 168 aircraft of varying types to fly over the Queen at RAF Odiham in a series of coordinated formations despite appalling weather conditions. As wing commander, he was Personal Staff Officer to the Chief of Staff, Allied Air Forces Central Europe and after his retirement a member of the Corps of Queen's Messengers, a Foreign and Commonwealth Office courier service for the delivery of important diplomatic documents around the world. He retired in January 1965, later stating that his reason for leaving the RAF prematurely was concern over an RAF plan in the mid-1960s \\"to snatch the Fleet Air Arm from the Navy. I knew from my study of military strategy that the demise of the Fleet Air Arm would render ineffective the Navy's role in preserving the sea communications on which Britain utterly depends.\\" Writer Allen's The Legacy of Lord Trenchard questioned the need for an independent RAF and the rectitude of Air Staff policies before and during the Second World War. The provocatively titled Who Won the Battle of Britain (first published in 1974) followed shortly afterwards with a critique of RAF structure, leadership and doctrine before and during the air campaigns of 1940. Controversially, Allen stated that RAF Fighter Command's 11 Group was a defeated force at the time the invasion was most likely to have been launched. Allen argued that the Luftwaffe did not lose the Battle of Britain air campaigns – reasoning that the Luftwaffe's damaging attacks on airfields containing vital sector stations gave them air superiority during the critical period of late August to early September preceding the change of focus to the bombing of London after which it dropped thousands of tons of bombs with negligible losses. But the Luftwaffe did not win it either as it lacked the training and equipment and therefore the potential to sink enough of the Royal Navy's warships, especially the large capital ships. Allen maintained that it was the deterrent effect of the Royal Navy fleet in being that was the decisive factor in Adolf Hitler's decision not to launch Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Great Britain. The air battles were important but not fundamental. Having been made aware of the naval problems by the German Naval Staff, Adolf Hitler took Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring's advice and switched to a Douhet night bombing campaign against civilian centres to try and force the United Kingdom into a negotiated peace. He concluded that \\"the Battle of Britain has been glorified to the point of hyperbole by British historians\\". =Primacy of sea power, 1940= Allen's case for the primacy of sea power in 1940 is not unique. Derek Robinson and Geoff Hewitt have argued similarly, seeing the Royal Navy as the main invasion deterrent in 1940. However, neither criticised the RAF's leadership and strategy as emphatically as Allen. Some air historians have argued that Fighter Command's 11 Group was \\"perilously close to collapse\\" owing to the loss of experienced pilots and damage to command and control infrastructure during the critical period. 11 Group's continuing effectiveness was particularly important because the beaches upon which the Germans planned to land were within their operational area. Anthony Cumming judged that the immense superiority of the Royal Navy in home waters together with the anti- maritime limitations of the Luftwaffe were the main reasons for the Third Reich effectively abandoning Operation Sea Lion in 1940. In 1958, Duncan Grinnell-Milne submitted his case on behalf of the Royal Navy and in 1960 was further supported by Captain Stephen Roskill, the British Official Naval Historian for the Second World War. Integrating elements of air and sea aspects, Telford Taylor put forward a thorough study of the question a few years later. In more recent years Cumming's The Royal Navy and the Battle of Britain has supported the primacy of seapower argument and James Holland's The Battle of Britain has included a detailed account of the struggle at sea along with accounts of air combat. Both show that sailors, soldiers and airmen were actively engaged in fighting the Germans during the Battle of Britain if the battle is defined to include events prior to the main air fighting such as the Norway campaign and the Dunkirk evacuation – Operation Dynamo. Even with a Luftwaffe victory in the air, neither Holland nor Cumming believes it likely that Operation Sea Lion would have succeeded if launched. The press heavily criticised three historians from the Joint Services Staff Command College, who were portrayed in a History magazine and the national press as supporting the idea that the Royal Navy won the Battle of Britain. In Britain, at least, questions surrounding the role of the RAF in the Battle of Britain remain sensitive. These historians later argued that this media coverage of their opinions was a 'silly season story par excellence', pointing out that the idea that a small number of young pilots had alone prevented a German invasion is something that historians have long disputed. What Battle of Britain accounts have lacked, they argued, is a more holistic approach that sees the campaign as one in which all three services had played a crucial role. Allen's Who Won the Battle of Britain and his articles were a step in this direction. Both The Legacy of Lord Trenchard and Who Won the Battle of Britain show signs of having been influenced by the former war correspondent and Sunday Times Defence Correspondent David Divine, another fierce critic of the air establishment. However, even Divine did not question the RAF's role and performance in the Battle of Britain as Allen did. =Criticism= Francis Mason criticised Allen's Who Won the Battle of Britain for displaying 'a bland ignorance of aircraft design' regarding the problems of fitting heavy calibre 0.5' machine guns to a Spitfire and 'ignoring the atmosphere of national parsimony in which successive air ministers and air staff members fought to provide any air defence at all.' Mason implied that Allen's criticism of the recently deceased Fighter Command chief, Air Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, who could no longer defend himself, was distasteful. Allen did indeed criticise Dowding's conduct of the battle, particularly for allowing the brunt of the fighting to fall upon the embattled 11 Group, but had also argued that Dowding's earlier achievements had been ignored in the failure to make him a Marshal of the Royal Air Force upon retirement. Dowding was sympathetically portrayed in the 1969 blockbuster feature film, Battle of Britain, and died in 1970. He was widely regarded as a national hero, and was officially acknowledged by the erection of his statue at the RAF Chapel, St Clement Dane a few years later. Public criticism of Dowding was controversial during the 1970s, although Laddie Lucas and Douglas Bader also considered Dowding to have deployed a 'parochial' defence that prevented the full resources of Fighter Command being used. Alfred Price, a historian known for attacking Battle of Britain myths, criticised Allen's Times assertion that the Luftwaffe could have knocked Britain out of the war had it concentrated the night blitz against British ports. To achieve this, Price argued, 'the Luftwaffe would have had to mount a series of heavy and accurate attacks, repeated at regular intervals over a period of several months … the force lacked both the strength and equipment to achieve this'. Sir John Slessor, a former RAF Director of Plans, 1937–1940, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force, claimed Allen's Times article on Lord Hugh Trenchard, 'Father of the RAF' contained 'multiple mis- statements' but did not attempt to detail what these were. Slessor had a long and close relationship with Trenchard and his biographer commented that 'In his [Slessor's] years at the Air Ministry he now became one of the most passionate disciples of Lord Trenchard and his theories of strategic air power as a war-winning weapon'. Margaret Salmond, widow of a senior air force officer also wrote a 'vehement protest' to Allen's phrase 'The Battle of Britain that never was' emphasising that 'we should never forget how much we owe to those brave young pilots …' reflecting a widely held perception that only a handful of RAF pilots had prevented the invasion. In fact it was never his intention to deprecate former comrades whom he had already praised but it was still difficult to attack popular perceptions of the RAF's role without seeming to attack 'the few'. Allen's views were given prominent coverage in the Times during the 44th and 48th Battle of Britain anniversaries. Publicising these opinions in such a prominent way did not endear Allen to former RAF colleagues or to the general public. Even his obituary writer considered Allen's views 'eccentric', not appearing to understand why previous editors took them as seriously as they did.

Danish immigration to Argentina was particularly intense between the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is estimated that between 1857 and 1930 about 18,000 Danes settled in Argentina. The wave of Danish immigration to Argentina was the third largest in the world, behind those in the United States and Australia, making it one of the largest Danish communities in the world. Danish immigrants needed to organise their own mini societies where they could be able to preserve and to speak their own language, maintaining the familiar traditions and develop a network in the form of churches, schools, newspapers and so on. Most Danes worked as farmers and quickly became part of the Argentine labour market, but full cultural integration was possible after several generations later. Through a close-knit personal networks and institutions such as churches, schools, clubs and other associations, they retained their Danish identity and so their descendants who still to this day can be found in Argentina. History Around 350,000 emigrants left Denmark between 1860 and 1930. There are no official records of how many Danes came exactly to Argentina, especially before 1886. It is known that between 1886 and 1890, the arrival of 1,300 Danish immigrants was computed.

He is currently the president of Chinese Democracy Education Foundation.Chinese Democracy Education Foundation, “About Us,” accessed March, 2014, http://www.cdef.org/Default.aspx?tabid=1195&language;=en-US  Early life and education  From early childhood, Fang was a sports enthusiast and was inspired by China’s return to the Olympic Games in 1984 to enroll at Beijing Sport University.Fang Chengle, “How an Army Tank Crushed My Legs - Special Interview with Fang Zheng,” created June 3 2005, The Epoch Times, In 1989, Fang was a senior at Beijing Sport University majoring in bio-dynamics in sports and planned to be a teacher in the Sports Department of South China Teachers College of Guangzhou. Fang was a member of the Chinese Communist Party.Epoch Times Staff, “Tiananmen Square Massacre Victim Allowed into Hong Kong to Attend Memorial Service,” last modified June, 2012, The Epoch Times,  Involvement during the June Fourth Crackdown  Fang had been in Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3 and early hours of June 4 and participated in a sit-in with fellow students at the Monument to the People's Heroes. After the decision to leave the Square peacefully at around 4:00 a.m. on June 4, Fang and his fellow students evacuated the Square. While evacuating, Fang witnessed pools of blood on the ground, broken glass, damaged vehicles and road blocks. As the students reached Chang’an Avenue at Liubukou, they were bombarded with gas that caused a female student to faint from shock beside Fang. Fang picked up the female student and pushed her to safety over a guardrail along the sidewalk.Faith J. H. McDonnell, “A Chinese Dissident’s Triumph,” November 12, 2009, Frontpage Mag, http://www.frontpagemag.com/2009/faith-j-h- mcdonnell/a-chinese-dissidents-triumph-by-faith-j-h-mcdonnell/ While Fang was aiding the female student, he saw in the corner of his eye a tank approaching. He was unable to save himself in time as the tank ran over both of Fang’s legs and dragged him for a short distance.Patrick E. Tyler, “China’s Discus Champ: Alone, Disabled and Barred,” The New York Times, September 8, 1994, international edition, https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/08/world/china-s- discus-champ-alone-disabled-and-barred.html At that moment, Fang lost consciousness and was brought to Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, where he underwent a double amputation. Fang’s right leg was amputated at the thigh, and his left leg below the knee. According to Fang, while in hospital, he was being investigated by the Public Security Bureau in an attempt to conceal the fact that students were attacked as they were leaving the square. For instance, at the hospital the Public Security officers prevented Fang from speaking out about the incident. Upon Fang’s return to school, he continued to face scrutiny and investigation by school officials attempting to suppress the incident by accusing Fang of being violent and having provoked the attack. During Fang’s stay at the hospital, the female student who Fang had rescued visited him and thanked him for saving her life. During the school’s investigation into the facts leading up to Fang’s incident, he asked the female student to testify on his behalf but she refused by stating that she could no longer remember what had happened and would later claim that she was not with him at the time of the incident.  Post-Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989  After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Fang was pressured by the Chinese government to admit that his injuries were from a road accident. Fang refused, which resulted in Beijing Sport University’s withholding of Fang’s university degree and denying him a work assignment. Fang’s involvement in the protests also led to legal complications that prevented him from registering his household and his marriage. Also, Fang withdrew his membership from the Chinese Communist Party.Fang Zheng, “Tiananmen Square,” accessed March, 2014, George W. Bush Institute, http://www.freedomcollection.org/regions/asia/china/fang_zheng/ From 1992 to 2000, Fang resided in Hainan Province where he continued to face monitoring, interrogation, and harassment in such instances as the detainment by police of family and friends visiting Fang in 1995 and the monitoring and cutting off of his phone line on anniversaries of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. = Sport competition = Fang, undeterred by his disability and political persecution, continued to pursue his passion of sport. In 1992 Fang represented Beijing at the third All-China Disabled Athletic Games in Guangzhou during which he won two gold medals and broke two records for the Far East and South Pacific region. In 1994, as China’s national champion discus thrower among disabled athletes, Fang was barred from representing China at the Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled in Beijing. Fang did not compete and was sent home before the competition after Communist Party officials discovered that his disability had resulted from the military crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. In response to his barring, Fang stated that “Even though I was injured on June 4, I should be treated the same as any other disabled man, but, in reality, the situation has proved to be different” and that “there should be no connection between my injury and the cause of my injury.” During training in the lead up to the Games, Fang was told by Communist Party officials overseeing the Games to avoid foreign journalists and to avoid answering any questions about the cause of his injury during news conferences in the event that he won a medal. Although Fang had agreed to the terms, he was later barred from competing. The official explanation for barring Fang from the Games was that the discus event was to be cancelled due to a lack of entrants from other countries. The event was later won by the only entrant, Martin Peter of New Zealand. In a Sky News interview during the lead-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Fang was prevented from retelling his account of the tank incident by government minders explaining that it was “something related to some sensitive issue on the history of China” and that “it would be great if we can skip this.”Sky News, “Real China,” Sky News video, 6:17, created 2008, http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8cqdz_china-tiananmen- square-1989-massacr_news = Immigration to the United States and Standing-Up Celebration = In August 2008 before the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Fang was issued a passport by the Chinese government. Fang, his wife Zhu Jin, and daughter Grace arrived in the United States in February 2009. By 2009, Fang had been using a wheel chair for twenty years. A few months after his arrival in the United States and with the help of specialists such as Dr. Terrance Sheehan and the donation of prosthetic legs by Medical Center Orthotics and Prosthetics, Fang was able to walk again.John Donvan and Katie Hinman, “Fang Zheng Dances in Name of Democracy,” October 7, 2009. ABC News, https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/20-years-tiananmen-square-fang-zheng-dances- democracy/story?id=8771789&page;=1 In 2009, an event was held in Washington, DC to celebrate Fang Zheng’s standing-up. The event was attended by Fang and his family, members of congress, media, and fellow Chinese dissidents including Yang Jianli, Feng Congde and Chai Ling.Shawn Tandon, “From Tiananmen to Democracy Dance,” October 9, 2009, The Brunei Times, Chai Ling, a student leader of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, described her experience at the celebration, “When the music went up and Fang started to dance with his wife, tears came to my eyes. I pictured a day when all the survivors of Tiananmen could stand up like Fang Zheng with their loved ones to celebrate life, love, and triumph over adversity.”Chai Ling, A Heart for Freedom (Illinois, Tyndale House Publishers, Inc., 2011), 281 Yang Jianli, who was also a student leader, described Fang’s story, “In the past 20 years, in his spirit, Fang Zheng has been standing — even without legs… but today he is standing up. It is my sincere hope that we Chinese people will stand up with Fang Zheng.\\" After Fang’s dance with his wife, Fang stated that “This is a feeling of new hope for me” and “at the same time, it’s also a feeling of new hope for China.” = Activism = On the twentieth anniversary of the June Fourth crackdown, Fang testified in front of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the United States Congress about the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and his experiences since the event.Fang Zheng, “Tiananmen Square and Human Rights in China,” June 2 2009, C-Span, http://www.c-span.org/video/?286765-1/tiananmen-square-human-rights-china He testified that since the June Fourth crackdown, the government has refused to admit to any wrongdoing, has not taken responsibility for its actions and has been mistreating and persecuting victims in the decades following the massacre. Also, Fang made a call for China to establish a committee for truth to find out who ordered the massacre in an effort to achieve justice for victims and true freedom for all of China. On the twenty-third anniversary of the June Fourth crackdown, Fang attended an annual rally and candle-light vigil at Victoria Park in Hong Kong. At the memorial, Fang gave a speech in which he stated “I have come to talk to people, especially young people, so that they can know the truth about the June 4 killings…” and that “the most effective weapon to fight the communist regime is to refuse to forget what the government wants us to forget, and to refuse to forget what the government has done.”Ng Kang-chung, “Tiananmen Victim ‘surprised’ to be allowed into HK,” June 2, 2012, South China Morning Post, http://www.scmp.com/article/1002697/tiananmen-victim-surprised-be-allowed-hk During his trip to Hong Kong, he also visited activists from the Hong Kong Federation of Students who had been participating in a 64-hour hunger strike at Times Square (Hong Kong) in Causeway Bay. Fang is the president of Chinese Democracy Education Foundation, an organization “promoting the common principle and general ideas of the prosperity and progress of Chinese society for democracy, freedom, human rights and constitutional reform.”  Personal life  Fang Zheng lives in the Bay Area with his three daughters.

It is responsible for transmitting malaria in some of these regions. The mosquito is made up of a species complex consisting of An. claviger sensu stricto and An. petragnani Del Vecchio. An. petragnani is found only in western Mediterranean region, and is reported to bite only animals, hence, it is not involved in human malaria. It was on An. claviger that Giovanni Battista Grassi established the fact that only the female mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum in humans. An. claviger was known for breeding abundantly in the Åland Islands of Finland. As a result, malaria was endemic in the islands for at least 150 years, with severe malaria outbreaks being recorded in the 17th century, and in 1853 and 1862. Scientific name Anopheles claviger was first described by Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1804. However due to its close resemblance with other anopheline mosquitoes, the systematics was variously changed. Originally Meigen named it Culex claviger which he changed it to An. bifurcutus in 1818. This was for a long period the accepted binomial but soon they realised that Carl Linnaeus had already used the name for the males of Culex pipiens. After a decade James Francis Stephens renamed it An. grisescens in 1828. A number of scientific names was introduced after they were discovered from one region after another. Some recognised synonyms are: * An. amaurus Martini * An. grisescens Stephens * An. habibi Mulligan and Puri * An. missiroli Del Vecchio * An. pollutus Canamares * An. turkestani Shingarev * An. villosus Robineau-Desvoidy Italian biologists G. Del Vecchio in 1939 and G. Lupascu in 1941 were the first to notice that An. claviger comprised two morphologically distinct species. In 1962 M. Coluzzi revised the taxonomic status by classifying An. claviger as a species complex inclusive of An. petragnani. The species could be identified only on small structural variation in the pupal stages, but is now identified using biochemical and molecular tools. Distribution Anopheles claviger is found throughout Palearctic ecozone including Afghanistan, Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, Serbia and Montenegro, extending to Middle East, China and Siberia. Member of the species complex An. petragnani is found only in western Mediterranean including France and Spain, up to Turkey, and absent from beyond. Description Female An. claviger is distinguished from other related species from its brownish colour and dark palps. It is also generally larger than others. The proboscis is dark-brown while the antennae are brown. The scales on the wings are dark, evenly distributed without any dark spot. The thorax and abdomen are brown with lighter colour at the posterior end. An. petragnani are generally darker than typical An. claviger. Males are basically similar but have complex arrangements of setae with dinstinct gonostyle. Biology An. claviger adults are most abundant in May and September during which maximum biting on humans takes place. The larval forms are most abundant during cold season from October to the next April. Larvae are generally found in cool and clean water. In the Mediterranean region they are commonly found in wells and water containers (very common in cisterns). In cold area the larvae hibernate during winter but in warmer climate, they do not hibernate although development is slow. Larvae of An. petragnani are slightly different in that they can tolerate higher water temperature. Therefore they can be found during summer under rockholes, ditches, canals and river banks. Mature larvae develop in the eggs 5 to 7 days after oviposition. Most eggs hatch within the next three days, but some may take up to one month. Females of the second generation (September) generally lay fewer eggs than those of the first generation (May). Egg maturation requires blood meal and about six days are required for blood digestion. Females attack human soon after they mate with males. They bite during broad daylight. Females hardly live inside houses so that biting occurs in open places. Unlike other anopheline mosquitoes which deposit their eggs directly on the water surface, female An. claviger lays eggs just above the water level but still in the wet area. They are zoophillic in that they bite mostly of large mammals including humans. There is no report An. petragnani in transmission of human malaria, indicating that they are exclusively zoophillic. Scientific importance An. claviger was experimentally used to discover the transmission of human malarial parasite P. falciparum, along with the fact that only female anophelines can transmit malaria. Before 1898 it was not known how malaria was transmitted. The Italian biologist Giovanni Battista Grassi started investigating different mosquito species in the early 1898 on the basis of mosquito-malaria theory. He suspected that only certain species were involved in transmission of malaria. In September Battista reported the presence of malarial parasite in An. claviger indicating it as malaria vector. Battista performed human experimentation on Abele Sola, who had been a patient for six years in the Hospital of the Holy Spirit (Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia) in Rome. With mutual consent Sola was bitten by malaria-infected mosquitoes for ten nights, and after few weeks he was down with tertian malaria. Battista and his colleagues Amico Bignami, Giuseppe Bastianelli and Ettore Marchiafava continued to demonstrate the same experiments in other patients and were always successful. In November they found the parasites on the gut wall of the infected mosquitoes. P. falciparum-carrying mosquito was no doubt the causative vector of malaria. They formally announced the discovery at the session of the Accademia dei Lincei on 4 December 1898. This experiment further established that An. claviger is the sole mosquito species responsible for human malaria in Italy, and other European countries. (In other parts of the world other species of Anopheles are responsible.) In addition the discovery laid the foundation for prevention of malaria by vector control of mosquitoes.

Gravity gliding, however, is applied to a block that is not being deformed, and is therefore less common to observe. However, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two in real world scenarios, and often both occur simultaneously.  Mechanism  For gravity spreading to occur, a rock mass must be driven to deformation by gravity. As long as the center of gravity of the system descends, portions of the system may rise. Of course, a material normally resists such deformation. For gravity spreading to occur, the differential stress must be greater than that rock body's yield strength. Gravity spreading can be thought of as a mound of molasses that spreads out, and gravity gliding can be imagined as a wooden block sliding down a slope. Examples =Earth= Mountains Heart Mountain in Wyoming, United States, has been extensively studied, because Ordovician age carbonates (Madison Limestone), sit on top of a much younger (~50Ma) sedimentary formation (Willwood Formation).NASA Earth Observatory. Heart Mountain, Wyoming. It is now largely accepted that this juxtaposition of old rocks on top of young is the result of gravity spreading and gliding. Field observations, such as slight internal deformations of the older formation, indicate the gravity gliding and spreading of the Madison Limestones.Hauge, T. A. (1985). Gravity Spreading origin of the Heart Mountain allochton, northwestern Wyoming. GSA Bulletin 96, p. 1440-1456. The specific details of the gravity spreading event are unclear, but it is thought that it was induced by the Laramide Orogeny, approximately 50 Ma. This caused the Madison Limestones to slide into the nearby Bighorn Basin, where it came to rest on top of the Willwood Formation. The cause for block motion is debated, with numerous models to explain how such a large block could have moved tens of kilometers down a slope of less than 2°.Beutner, E. C., Gerbi, G. P. (2005). Catastrophic emplacement of the Heart Mountain block slide, Wyoming and Montana, USA. GSA Bulletin 117, p. 724-725. Models have ranged from lubrication by hydrothermal circulation, movement initiation from volcanogenic seismicity, to frictional heating dissociating CO2 from the carbonates, resulting in dramatically reduced friction. The last of these theories is among the most recent, and by far the most spectacular. The authors envisage initially slow sliding, likely as the result of a volcanic eruption, until frictional heating of the carbonate rocks creates a supercritical CO2 layer, decreasing the friction tremendously. From this point, the sliding would occur rapidly, perhaps as high as 150 km/h. Passive Margins Gravity spreading in passive margins occurs when gravitational forces are strong enough to overcome the overburdens resistance to motion along its basal surface, and the internal strength. The gravitational forces are a function of the dip of the slope and the dip of the décollement layer. Lava Flows Rhyolite lava flows in northeastern New South Wales, Australia show recumbent folds that record a history of vertical shortening and lateral extension during deposition, consistent with what one would expect from gravity spreading. This is the result of lava being displaced by new lava extruding from the vent. =Mars= Satellite images of Mars have shown that the Thaumasia Plateau has large amounts of thrust faults, normal faults, and ridges. This rifting has resulted in canyons, and compression at the front of the \\"mega-slide\\" has caused the ridges and thrust faults observed at low end of the region. To explain these faults and ridges, a four-stage model involving gravity spreading is used: # A thick salt layer is deposited. This is possible in either wet or dry conditions. # Tharsis, a volcanic plateau, was emplaced. This increased both the heat flux of the area, as well as the topographic slope. Volcanism associated with Tharsis also deposited ash and lava flows. # The layers of salt and ice beneath the volcanics provided detachment points for the initiation of gravity spreading to the southeast. # Fractures from the basal detachment plane opened an aquifer, resulting in the release of water and incision of outflow channels. = Venus = It has been suggested that the \\"blocky\\" surface of Venus is the result of gravity spreading. This is thought because of flow-like structures correlated with topography, and as well as potential regions of thermal uplift, and has been reinforced by terrestrial analogues.

Released in 1929, it was the fourth film released by RKO Pictures, starring Sally Blane, Hugh Trevor, Allen Kearns, Doris Eaton and Frank Craven. A comedy based on the theory of eugenics, it was a critical and financial failure. The play was filmed before in 1920 as a silent starring Taylor Holmes. The 1920 film is lost. Plot Alan Camp has written a book on eugenics, and is looking to prove his theories. His sister, Edith Goodhue, and her husband, Gilbert have been frustrated for years with their inability to have children. Alan convinces them to let him to create a child through eugenics for them to adopt. Chosen to be the parents of this eugenic child are Joe Garvin, who happens to be Alan's chauffeur, and Nora, the Goodhues' maid. The two are offered $15,000 each if they conceive and deliver a child within twelve months, to which they agree. To give the young couple room to move ahead with the plan, the Goodhues leave on a year trip to California. Nora and Joe do have the baby, but have fallen in love in the interim and have decided to keep the child. When the Goodhues return from California, they find their home has been converted into a nursery, occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Garvin, who have married. They will not give up their baby, and Alan frantically sends Joe to a local orphanage in order to find a replacement baby. However, the child Joe returns with is rejected by Edith and Gilbert. Despondent, Alan decides to have the nursery dismantled, when Mrs. Goodhue announces that she is pregnant.

History  =Research= There were two parallel investigations during the crime series. One was conducted by the OS7 Drug Department, directed by Mayot Ávila. The other was by a special group of the Investigations Police of Chile (PDI), directed by Commissioner Nelson Lillo. The key to finding the two murderers was delivered by Corporal Juan Quijada, of the First Commissariat of Viña del Mar. After Sagredo confessed to the crimes, Corporal Quijada denounced him to the OS7 Drug Department. =Detention and judicial process= Sagredo and Topp Collins were brought to justice on March 8, 1982, and declared guilty by the Minister in visit Dinorah Cameratti on March 13, 1982. Jorge Sagredo and Carlos Topp Collins confessed extrajudicially, judicially and publicly to all their crimes. In this way, both were found guilty and sentenced to death, a sentenced first handed down on January 8, 1983 by the minister in visit Julio Torres Allú. The sentence was confirmed in the second instance by the unanimity of the First Chamber of the Court of Appeals of Valparaíso, composed of the ministers Margarita Osnovikoff, Iris González and Guillermo Navas. The sentence was ratified unanimously by the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Chile, consisting of the ministers Osvaldo Erbetta Vaccaro, Emilio Ulloa Muñoz, Abraham Meersohn Schijman and the lawyers Raúl Rencoret Donoso and Cecilli Cáceres, on January 17, 1985. =Execution= After they were denied a presidential pardon by Augusto Pinochet, both were executed in Quillota on January 29, 1985. This was the last execution before the death penalty was repealed in Chile in 2001.
