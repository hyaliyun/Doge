It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 for having state-level significance in the themes of architecture and exploration/settlement. It was nominated as Southeast Minnesota's oldest surviving example of the traditional European construction occasionally produced by the region's Germanic immigrants. The house is about north of Elba, Minnesota, within the Whitewater Wildlife Management Area, a state wildlife preserve adjacent to Whitewater State Park. Description The house seen from the south The Nicholas Marnach House is a rectangular, two-story building with a rear lean-to set into a hillside. There is an attic under a half-hip roof, and a partial basement under the east half of the house. The walls are constructed of randomly laid limestone covered by thick stucco, and are up to thick. It has three rooms on each floor, each room having a large square window facing south. Narrow staircases provide access between the floors. The attic has smaller windows on either gable, and a layer of concrete poured over the plank flooring as a form of fireproofing. The house is built in the Quereinhaus style that had become popular in rural Luxembourg in the 1840s. The style includes design features in use since medieval times, such as the mortise and tenon timber framing, massive stone walls, stucco façade, square windows, and half-hip roof. History John and Mary Marnach, with their son Nicholas, were immigrants from the commune of Rambrouch in Luxembourg. Many of their countrymen had settled in the communities of Elba and Rollingstone in Winona County. Most of the settlers built simple, subsistence-style residences, but the Marnachs opted to employ construction methods hearkening back to medieval Germany. Farmers and stonemasons by trade, they constructed a home for themselves in four stages from 1857 to 1860. The house stood on a stagecoach road between Minneiska and Plainview, Minnesota. It was part of the now-abandoned townsite of Whitewater Falls. A wooden lean- to was added to the rear of the house in 1914. The central room on the second level after restoration with blue painted wooden stairs going to the attic The house remained occupied for several decades, but by the mid-20th century it stood vacant. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in January 1978. Descendants of the area's settlers spearheaded an international effort to preserve the deteriorating house, gaining the assistance of the Luxembourg government and donations collected by Luxembourg schoolchildren. From 1991 to 1993 craftsmen from Luxembourg worked with local volunteers to restore the Marnach House, replacing the roof, doors, windows, and shutters, reconstructing much of the west wall, replastering the interior, and installing new flooring. On August 12, 1993 the restored house was dedicated in a ceremony that included former Luxembourg prime minister Pierre Werner. Significance The Nicholas Marnach House is the only fieldstone farmhouse of its size and type in Southeast Minnesota. It is also the oldest known surviving example of traditional European construction among the region's pioneer architecture. It is both a testament to the area's Germanic immigrants and a rare vision of northern European architecture transposed to a similar environment in the New World. Access The Nicholas Marnach House stands on public land in a state wildlife area, and can be reached by foot year-round. Occasional public events provide wagon or sleigh rides to the house, and guided tours of the interior.

Much of the Government of California is in practice the responsibility of county governments, such as the Government of Stanislaus County. The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas. The County government is composed of the elected five-member Board of Supervisors, several other elected offices including the Sheriff-Coroner, District Attorney, Assessor, Auditor-Controller, Treasurer-Tax Collector, and Clerk- Recorder, and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Some chartered cities such as Modesto and Turlock provide municipal services such as police, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, and zoning. Some other cities arrange to have the County provide some or all of these services on a contract basis. In addition, several entities of the government of California have jurisdiction conterminous with Stanislaus County, such as the Stanislaus County Superior Court.  Organization = Board of Supervisors = The five-member elected Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors (BOS) is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process. As of January 2017 the members of the Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors were: * Kristin Olsen—District 1 * Vito Chiesa—District 2, Chairman * Terry Withrow—District 3 * Dick Monteith—District 4 * Jim DeMartini—District 5, Vice-Chairman = Elected officers = In addition to the Board of Supervisors, there are several elected officers that form the Government of Stanislaus County that are required by the California Constitution and California law. The Stanislaus County Sheriff-Coroner provides general-service law enforcement to unincorporated areas of the county, serving as the equivalent of the county police for unincorporated areas of the county, as well as incorporated cities within the county who have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services (known as \\"contract cities\\"). The Stanislaus County District Attorney prosecutes felony and misdemeanor crimes that occur within the jurisdiction of Stanislaus County. = Other departments = The Community Services Agency (CSA) administers multiple California welfare programs within the county, such as Medi-Cal (Medicaid), CalFresh (food stamps), CalWORKs (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), a Medically Indigent Service Program (MISP), and a Low Income Health Program (Obamacare). The Stanislaus County Library is the county library system.  Law  The Stanislaus County Code is the codified law of the County in the form of ordinances passed by the Board of Supervisors. Every act prohibited or declared unlawful, and every failure to perform an act required, by the ordinances are misdemeanor crimes, unless otherwise specified as infractions.California Government Code § 25132.  Other governments = California = The Stanislaus Superior Court, which covers the entire county, is not a County department but a division of the State's trial court system. Historically, the courthouses were county-owned buildings that were maintained at county expense, which created significant friction since the trial court judges, as officials of the state government, had to lobby the county Board of Supervisors for facility renovations and upgrades. In turn, the state judiciary successfully persuaded the state Legislature to authorize the transfer of all courthouses to the state government in 2008 and 2009 (so that judges would have direct control over their own courthouses). Courthouse security is still provided by the county government under a contract with the state. = Modesto = The Government of Modesto is defined under the Charter of the City of Modesto. It is a mayor–council government and consists of the Mayor, City Council, and numerous departments and officers under the supervision of the City Manager, such as the Modesto Police Department, Modesto Fire Department, Modesto Public Works Department, and Modesto Community & Economic Development Department. As of January 2017 the current Mayor was Ted Brandvold, and the Councilors were: * Mani Grewal—District 1 * Tony Madrigal—District 2 * Kristi Ah You—District 3 * Bill Zoslocki—District 4 * Jenny Kenoyer—District 5 * Doug Ridenour Sr.—District 6 = School districts = Stanislaus County is covered by the Yosemite Community College District. = Special districts = The Stanislaus County Local Agency Formation Commission is the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) for Stanislaus County and regulates most special district and city boundaries.

(formerly Jellyvision Games, Inc.) is an American video game developer based in Chicago, Illinois, best known for the You Don't Know Jack series of quiz-based party video games and The Jackbox Party Pack series. Founded by Harry Nathan Gottlieb, the company operated as Jellyvision Games from 1995 until its closure in 2001. After seven years of dormancy, Jellyvision Games was revived in 2008, and the company rebranded as Jackbox Games in 2013.  History  The earliest incarnation of Jackbox Games was founded in 1989 by Harry Nathan Gottlieb as an educational entertainment company called Learn Television. Prior to developing You Don't Know Jack, the company created a children's trivia game called That's a Fact, Jack!. In 1995, the company rebranded as Jellyvision and developed the first edition of You Don't Know Jack; originally a PC game, its success established a franchise, and Jellyvision produced numerous installments of You Don't Know Jack from 1995 through 1998. In 2001, the computer game market shifted, as players moved from personal computers to home consoles of the sixth generation, affecting the demand for CD-ROM games. Jellyvision attempted to enter the marketplace with console-based versions of You Don't Know Jack, but these games were unsuccessful. The company had to drastically cut its staff, dropping from 75 to about 6 people. Jellyvision Games was subsequently shelved, and the following year Gottlieb launched a new company called the Jellyvision Lab. Pivoting away from games, the Jellyvision Lab focused on business software, developing a technology called the \\"interactive conversation interface\\" inspired by the voice-driven interface of You Don't Know Jack. These interactive conversation products were a success, in part because of clients who had been fans of the You Don't Know Jack series. In 2008, as networked consoles and mobile devices became popular, Jellyvision Games was relaunched as a subsidiary of the Jellyvision Lab, hiring Mike Bilder to lead the studio. The company looked to revitalize You Don't Know Jack for these new systems, subsequently releasing an iOS application and, in partnership with THQ, a console version in 2011. The studio later developed a Facebook version of the game, allowing them to continuously provide new trivia; later, the game expanded to include a standalone mobile application that allows data sharing and competition with the Facebook version. The game, now defunct, was awarded the \\"Social Game of the Year\\" at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards. Near the end of 2011, Jellyvision Games was spun off into a separate company. The studio rebranded as Jackbox Games in June 2013, and announced that it would continue to focus on developing social games for current platforms including mobile devices and home entertainment devices like Roku and Ouya. During this time, the company introduced a unique feature that allowed the game to be played using smartphones and tablets as controllers, rather than actual game controllers. Jackbox released more apps including Clone Booth (a humorous photo-manipulation app) and the games Lie Swatter (a find-the-lies game of wacky facts) and Word Puttz (a mini-golf themed word game), before turning its attention back to consoles with its 2014 release of Fibbage: The Hilarious Bluffing Party Game. Fibbage first appeared on the Amazon Fire TV but soon after was released as a digital-only title on Xbox One, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in September 2014. Fibbage also uses the phones-as-controllers technology, allowing players to type in bluffs to fool other players, and allowing up to 8 players to play in one room (no actual physical controllers are used to play the game). Fibbage proved successful with players, particularly using streaming media services like Twitch. The company saw potential in this, and in 2014, packaged Fibbage, You Don't Know Jack, and three other games that were designed to be played with others over a stream, as well as creating a high-value product for consumers. This was the first Jackbox Party Pack, and they have continued working on this approach, releasing a new Party Pack each year. AdWeek recognized Jackbox's CCO, Allard Laban, as one of the top 12 digital innovators in 2017 for being able to bring back the company from its downsizing struggles in 2001. In 2018 You Don't Know Jack was displayed in the Chicago New Media 1973-1992 exhibition, curated by jonCates. In the first half of 2020, much of the world was forced to stay at home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Jackbox games, particularly the Jackbox Party Pack with easy integration with video conferencing applications, became highly popular as ways to pass the time and connect with friends and family, leading Jackbox Games to expand server capacity to help support the increased popularity of the games. They also arranged special charity Jackbox game streams with celebrities to raise money for charities responding to the pandemic, with over raised by May 2020.  Games developed = You Don't Know Jack series (2011–2012)= Jackbox Games was founded to bring back Jellyvision's premiere title, You Don't Know Jack, which prior to 2011 had not been published since 2002. The revival sought to take advantage of newer technologies such as modern consoles and mobile gaming tied with Facebook integration. The Jackbox Game has brought three of these standalone titles to market: * You Don't Know Jack – 2011 – For personal computers and consoles * You Don't Know Jack (Facebook) – 2012 – Via Facebook integration, and later to include tie-in iOS/Android versions. * You Don't Know Jack Party (Amazon Fire TV) = The Jackbox Party Pack series (2014–present) = The Jackbox Party Pack games are individual collections of several party games, designed for online play by multiple people, including large audiences, via streaming websites like Twitch. Since 2014, Jackbox has released a new set of games in these packs each year, with a total of six games currently released, and a seventh announced.  Standalone games  Jackbox Games developed additional games initially geared to mobile devices after the success of the Facebook- based You Don't Know Jack game. These have been released as individual titles, while some have been then featured as part of The Jackbox Party Pack. = Lie Swatter (2013) = Lie Swatter presents the player with a number of statements which may be true or false, and the player is required to determine which ones are lies and \\"swat\\" them. The player earns points for correctly-guessed answers (i.e. not swatting true statements and swatting false ones). = Clone Booth (2013) = Clone Booth is a photo app for mobile devices that allows one to take a photo and then have that digitally manipulated into a number of stock historical images which then can be shared via mobile devices. = Word Puttz (2013) = Word Puttz is a single player game for mobile devices. On each level, the player is presented with a miniature golf hole, including a tee and a cup; other obstacles may also be present. The objective is to create words using a given set of letter tiles to create a path from the tee to the hole, in the manner of Scrabble. The player is scored based on how few words they use, as well as point values of those letters in the words. = Fibbage (2014) = Fibbage is a party game played by up to eight players via a streaming channel. It is broken into three rounds. In the first two rounds, each player has an opportunity to pick one of five randomly selected categories, and then all players are presented with an obscure fact with a missing word or phrase. Each player secretly provides the answer to the missing phrase, trying to craft an answer that appears legitimate. If players enter the correct answer, they are told of this and encouraged to enter a false answer. The game then presents all players' answers and the correct answer randomly. Players must then select the correct answer. If the player selected the correct answer, they score points, while if other players have selected that player's fake answer, they also score points for each player that selected their answer. In the final round, the game provides one last question for all players to answer. The player with the most points at the end wins. Following each question, players including the audience members have the opportunity to mark one or more answers as favorites, and the player with the most favorites is shown at the end of the game. Improved versions of Fibbage, offering new questions/prompts and additional features, have been included in various Jackbox Party Packs. = Quiplash (2015) = Quiplash is played over 3 rounds. In the first two rounds, players are given two prompts to supply a humorous answer for; each prompt is seen by two random players. Then, the prompt and the two provided answers are shown, and players and the audience vote on which is funniest, with the players that provided the answers given points on how many votes they get. If they end up getting all of the votes, they get a \\"quiplash\\" and earn a bonus score. The final round has all players reply to the same prompt, and players subsequently select three of the answers as the funniest. The winner is the player with the most points in the end. Quiplash was developed by Jackbox Games with the intent as a game designed for streaming and enabling the audience to be an active participant, working from their previous success with a similar model of play from Fibbage and Drawful. Jackbox used a Kickstarter approach to fund development of the game, with the March 2015 campaign seeking and finishing with over from over 1,600 backers. Enhanced versions of Quiplash featuring more prompts have been included in The Jackbox Party Pack. = Drawful 2 (2016) = Drawful 2 is a standalone game released on June 21, 2016 for Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One.

The march moved from Lahore to Islamabad between 14 and 17 January 2013 and was organised by the Pakistani Sufi scholar Muhammad Tahir- ul-Qadri. On 17 January, the government came for negotiations and struck and agreement which was termed the Islamabad Long March Declaration, that ended the protest. Background A series of corruption scandals had plagued Pakistan in the years preceding 2013, including a case against President Asif Zardari and former Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani, who was found to be in contempt of court. The leader of the long march stayed in a bulletproof container. As the march culminated, incumbent Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf was also found guilty of corruption in his previous cabinet post, as Minister for Water and Power. A general election is due to be held in the spring of 2013. Shortly after returning from self-imposed exile in Canada (where he acquired Canadian citizenship), Qadri gave a speech on 23 December 2012, in which he denounced the rampant corruption at all levels of government. The speech galvanised demonstrators who were already frustrated with the president's inability to reduce militancy and improve the economy of Pakistan. Goals The initial goal of the march was to request electoral reforms such as disallowing corrupt incumbents from standing for election and to bring forward the date for the general election due in 2013. Qadri also called for a pre-election interim government to be appointed with input from the country's judiciary and military. The demand for an interim government was met with skepticism because the military's involvement in civilian affairs would set back the democracy that had often been abrogated in the history of Pakistan; the military denied this charge. Upon reaching Islamabad the goal of the march evolved to call for the dissolution of the Parliament of Pakistan by 15 January and making President Asif Ali Zardari \\"an ex-president\\" by staging a sit-in in front of parliament (a deadline that was overlooked). Qadri also called for the dissolution of the provincial assemblies and the disbanding of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). Protest march Due to Qadri's 2010 Fatwa on Terrorism, there had been concerns from the government that a large rally led by him could be targeted by militants. As such, schools and many businesses on the march route closed and more than 10,000 police and paramilitary troops were deployed throughout Islamabad. Prior to the march, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement withdrew because of security concerns. Qadri had called for a march of over a million people, but the media reported that the actual number of participants was more than 50,000. A caravan of protestors left Lahore in hundreds of buses, vans, motorcycles and cars. Despite government blockades using cordons of freight containers and barbed wire, the convoy was allowed to enter Islamabad, where Qadri held a rally on Jinnah Avenue, about two miles from the parliament. Demonstrators heard Qadri say: \\"Tomorrow, the injustices will end, and these corrupt people no longer will run the government! ... [To Zardari] Don't test the patience of these people.\\" After previously deciding to stop the protesters from staging a sit-in outside parliament, the government allowed them to go from the rally to stage the sit- in about 500 yards from the parliament. On the morning of 15 January 2013, the police tried to disperse the protesters and arrest Qadri. Live television coverage showed forces firing in the air – a serious escalation in attempts to control crowds – while supporters of Qadri hurled stones at them. Qadri's spokesman told Reuters the crowds had prevented government forces from arresting Qadri. He said six supporters were wounded. Reactions At the end of the march, Tehreek-e-Insaaf Chairman Imran Khan said that the current government could not ensure a free and fair election and should resign. He also demanded an immediate announcement of the general election's date, the formation of a non-partisan interim government, that the election be conducted on a predetermined schedule by an independent election commission, some immediate action on the Supreme Court's ruling for the dismissal of Prime Minister Ashraf regarding the Rental Power Projects case, and the immediate arrest of the perpetrators of the January 2013 Pakistan bombings in Quetta. He further told his party workers to be patient and wait for his call after a party meeting on 16 January in order to bring change through the ballot box. Khan also warned the government of another Long March if the Supreme Court's orders were not implemented. Awami Muslim League Chairman Shaikh Rasheed Ahmad commended the participants and said that the Long March was not a flop and, as a result, Qadri would have a mandate in discussions. He added that the demonstrators did not care about their hunger nor severe weather but would stay in Islamabad until their demands were met and that, as such, the government was in a dangerous situation. Government of Punjab Minister for Law Rana Sanaullah said that people had rejected Qadri's \\"foreign agenda\\" because they had not participated on the scale envisioned (millions of demonstrators) and that, as a consequence of this flop, Qadri was extremely despondent. As such, he suggested that Qadri should now display wisdom and accept the people's will. He further noted the Punjab government's expenditure of Rs 40 crores and the deployment of over 50,000 police to provide security for the event. The Chairman of the All Pakistan Traders Association, Sheikh Muhammad Saddique, said that a majority of the governing and opposition leaders blamed Qadri for finding funding from foreign countries and had criticised his dual nationality, while accusing him of not having a specific agenda. Despite strong opposition, Saddique also said the Long March was not a flop. The Chairman of the All Pakistan Civil Society, Azhar Mir, said that a gathering of such a magnitude could not be ignored and could be dangerous for the government. He suggested that the government had to rectify the situation since the \\"'Long March' show has not flopped.\\" Salman Akram Raja, a senior Supreme Court lawyer, said that the constitution of Pakistan did not have a provision to accept Qadri's demands and that \\"the revolution of Qadri is totally against the constitution, which I strongly condemn.\\" Jinnah Institute's Raza Rumi said: \\"This represents a big threat to Pakistan's parliamentary process and its hard-fought democratic freedoms.\\" =Media= Regarding the march, the Daily Times wrote that it \\"took away [the] capital's charm\\" because, while such rallies are a democratic right, the protesters left behind a trail of garbage and made the local inhabitants' life abnormal. The Frontier Post suggested that a resolution to the conflict could ease pressure on the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) following criticism of its inability to deal with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan's insurgency and the weak economy. Declaration The Islamabad Long March Declaration was signed by Prime Minister Raja Parvez Ashraf following the appointment of a 10-member committee to negotiate with Qadri. Qadri accepted the agreement after he issued a second ultimatum from his bullet-proof mobile quarters. The government's decision to proceed with the negotiation arose from fear that inclement weather would lead to deaths among those picketing the parliament. The government's negotiation committee was led by former Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and included members from all parties in the governing coalition, including PPP leader Makhdoom Amin Fahim and Law Minister Farooq H. Naek. On the night of 17 January, Qadri told the protesters gathered in Islamabad that he would be allowed to have a say in the appointment of an interim prime minister to oversee the election. The agreement also led to permitting an extra month for the electoral process so as to allow for the scrutinising of the electoral nomination in order to keep out corrupt and criminal figures. The agreement also proposed two potential prime ministerial candidates in \\"complete consensus\\" with the opposition. The composition of the ECP would be decided later in a consensual manner as its members could only be formally impeached and all parties had given their accession to the commission. Specifically, the National Assembly would be dissolved before 16 March with the election being held within 90 days following one month of scrutiny of the nominees, under Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution of Pakistan. The treasury benches would coordinate with the Pakistan Awami Tehreek to nominate one of the two prime ministerial nominees. Electoral reforms would entail a focus on: Articles 62, 63 and 218 (3) of the constitution; Sections 77 to 82 of the Representation of Peoples' Act 1976 (and other provisions on the conduct of a free, fair, just and honest election and against corrupt practices); and the Supreme Court Judgment of 8 June 2012 on constitutional petition 87 of 2011 (challenging election campaign expenses and its regulation) which should be implemented in \\"true letter and spirit.\\" Further, all charges registered by the counter parties against each other would be withdrawn immediately with no recourse to victimisation and vendetta. Qadri then congratulated the demonstrators, notably the female party workers, the country, and the government for a successful end to the protests and said that it was a model for the world to see. He stated, \\"It is a day of victory for the marchers and the nation alike. [I thank] Almighty Allah who bestowed His blessings [on the protesters].\\" He then read the text of the declaration's five points to the gathered audience. =Reactions to the declaration= In reaction to the declaration, Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q) leader and committee chairman Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain said that he was thankful to Allah for helping to amicably resolve all the issues. PPP leader Makhdoom Amin Fahim, Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) leader Farooq Sattar, Awami National Party (ANP) leader Afrasiab Khattak, Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira and others congratulated the country over the resolution. Kaira said: \\"Nobody has lost anything in dialogue; rather it is [a] victory of the democracy; it is [a] victory of the entire nation; it is [a] victory of rule of law\\" and added that Qadri deserved special commendation for conducting a peaceful rally. Qadri then thanked the media for raising awareness of the situation, in particular his party's rally. The following day, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif said that the march had reached its logical end by turning into an \\"Allied March.\\" He also told lawmakers in Lahore that the goals of the protest were not met and that innocent children, women and old people were made to wait in the cold and rain as the \\"desires of anti-democratic forces were foiled and an attempt to derail democracy, in the name of so-called revolution near the general elections, was defeated.\\" Jamaat-e-Islami's Ameer Syed Munawar Hasan said that the march ended \\"in a frightful manner\\" with an agreement that met none of the demands. He argued that although Qadri exalted the Supreme Court's arrest order for the prime minister, Qadri then \\"accepted the script signed by the same premier\\". He added that Qadri was seen embracing and commending the government's representatives who he had previously called \\"former ministers,\\" while the information minister who had ridiculed Qadri then embraced him. He also accused Qadri of playing with the sentiments of thousands of people and asserted that the demand for reforming the electoral commission was unconstitutional and \\"highly non-serious.\\" Munawar added that it was unfortunate that those who had attended such fairs did not listen to their so- called well wishers. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) also closed inquiries into Qadri and his party's funding for organising the march.

It also serves the surrounding areas of Berwick Hills and Park End, as well as the nearby Middlesbrough Sports Village. It is located approximately south east of Middlesbrough, and is operated by Northern Trains who provide all of the station's passenger services. The long single platform station includes a fully lit waiting shelter with seating, CCTV coverage and passenger information via an electronic screen and public address announcements. The station serves James Cook University Hospital. History Plans for the building of a station at the hospital had been discussed for some 25 years, including as part of the Tees Valley Metro project. The station was finally given the green light by Middlesbrough Council's planning committee in January 2013 and construction work started in January 2014. The station cost £2.2 million to build and opened to the public on 18 May 2014. The station was officially opened on 18 July 2014 by the then Minister of State for Transport, Baroness Kramer. According to the Office of Rail and Road statistics, there were 37,080 total entries and exits at the station in the 2018–19 period. Services As of the December 2019 timetable change, Northern Trains run an hourly service on the Esk Valley Line between Middlesbrough and Nunthorpe, with 6 trains (4 trains on Sundays) per day continuing to Whitby. Most trains heading towards Middlesbrough continue to Newcastle and Hexham (with some trains running as far as Carlisle). Additional trains on weekdays and Saturdays run along the Esk Valley Line to Castleton Moor (departing from James Cook at 13:00), and Battersby (departing from James Cook at 17:04). Following the May 2014 timetable change, the service between Middlesbrough and Nunthorpe was significantly improved, with this allowing for a regular service to the new station at James Cook University Hospital. Predominantly, rolling stock on the Esk Valley Line consists of Class 156 and Class 158 diesel multiple units, both of which were introduced in to service in the late 1980s. The Class 156 and 158 units operating on the Esk Valley Line are currently in the process of being refurbished, with upgrades including free WiFi, power sockets, on-board passenger information displays, and an interior refresh. Class 142 'Pacer' trains served the line, until the turn of the new decade, when they were withdrawn from passenger service. Class 144 'Pacer' trains were also used frequently on the Esk Valley Line, until around 2005.

Early life  Avital was born in the town of Givatayim to Moroccan and Yemeni parents. At age 11, he began his formal training, studying classical guitar at the Givatayim Conservatory. Upon entering Thelma Yellin, Israel's leading high school for the arts, Avital switched to acoustic bass and began studying and arranging jazz. When he was 17, Avital began playing professionally in jazz, pop, and folk music bands, as well as performing regularly on national television, radio, and in jazz festivals. He spent a year in the Israeli Army Orchestra and then moved to New York in 1992 where he began playing, recording, and touring professionally. Career After arriving in New York in 1992, Avital began playing in groups with Roy Haynes, Jimmy Cobb, Nat Adderley, Walter Bishop, Jr., Al Foster, Kenny Garrett, Steve Grossman, Jimmy Lovelace, and Rashied Ali. In 1994, he began collaborating with pianist Jason Lindner, with whom Avital began leading his own groups and big band during the after-hours sessions at Smalls Jazz Club in Greenwich Village.

The perpetrator, Adam Lanza, fatally shot his mother before murdering 20 students and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and later committed suicide. A number of fringe figures have promoted conspiracy theories that doubt or dispute what occurred at Sandy Hook. Various conspiracy theorists have claimed, for example, that the massacre was actually orchestrated by the U.S. government as part of an elaborate plot to promote stricter gun control laws. The more common conspiracy theory, initially disseminated by Alex Jones on InfoWars, denied that the massacre actually occurred, asserting that it was \\"completely fake.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/us/politics/alex-jones-infowars- sandy-hook.amp.htmlChris Sommerfeld, SEE IT: Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones doubles down on 'completely fake' Sandy Hook massacre claims , New York Daily News (November 18, 2016). (After being sued by some parents of the victims, Jones reversed his stance and admitted that the massacre was real.)https://www.vox.com/2019/3/31/18289271/alex-jones-psychosis- conspiracies-sandy-hook-hoax No evidence supports the conspiracy theories, which make a number of implausible claims. Moreover, many Sandy Hook conspiracy theories contradict one another. A number of sources have published articles debunking various claims put forward by conspiracy theorists. In 2018, the parents of several children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Alex Jones and other authors of conspiracy videos for defamation, accusing them of engaging in a campaign of \\"false, cruel, and dangerous assertions\\".Aaron Cooper, \\"Six more Sandy Hook families sue broadcaster Alex Jones\\", May 24, 2018, CNN, https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/23/us/alex-jones-sandy-hook-suit/index.html Conspiracy claims=United States government involvement= Some conspiracy theories have alleged that the shooting was a hoax and a false flag operation staged by the United States government. Others claim the attack is being used by politicians to push through new gun control legislation, or to otherwise persecute gun owners and survivalists. Lawyer and dentist Orly Taitz best known for her promotion of Barack Obama citizenship (\\"birther\\") conspiracy theorieswas quoted as asking \\"Was Adam Lanza drugged and hypnotized by his handlers to make him into a killing machine as an excuse as the regime is itching to take all means of self defense from the populace before the economic collapse?\\" Talk show host Clyde Lewis wrote: \\"Don’t you find it at all interesting that Adam Lanza, the alleged shooter at Sandy Hook, woke up one day and decided to shoot up a school and kill children at about the same time that Barack Obama told the U.N. that he would sign the small arms treaty?\\" According to Live Science, \\"No one, regardless of what side of the gun control issue they are on, can deny that guns played a key role in the Sandy Hook killings. So the conspiracy theorists must instead challenge the claim that the attack even occurred. They believe it's all a hoax to scare people into supporting more gun control and a step toward an outright repeal of the Second Amendment.\\" They also found that the vast majority of evidence used by conspiracy theorists to support the concept that Sandy Hook was a hoax is contradictory. Snopes.com also debunked several claims of alleged United States government involvement in the shootings. =Claims broadcast by Iranian television= Press TV, the official state media outlet of Iran, has promoted various antisemitic conspiracy theories blaming \\"Israeli death squads\\" for the shooting. Press TV interviewed Veterans Today website Gordon Duff, who quoted Michael Harris, a former Republican candidate for governor of Arizona, who made the \\"Israeli death squads\\" claim. Harris has publicly associated with neo-Nazi groups in the past and has previously claimed that Israel was responsible for the 2011 Norway attacks. Duff asserted that the attacks were an act of \\"revenge\\" for the perceived cooling of Israel–United States relations under President Obama, especially as a response to Obama's decision to nominate former senator Chuck Hagel, a perceived critic of Israel, for the position of United States Secretary of Defense. In another broadcast by Press TV, Holocaust denier James H. Fetzer claimed that the massacre \\"appears to have been a psy op intended to strike fear in the hearts of Americans\\" that was conducted by \\"agents of Israel.\\" The Washington Post reported that claims broadcast on Press TV contain a large number of \\"obvious logical fallacies\\" typical of Iranian propaganda, which \\"has a well-earned reputation for incendiary anti-Israel stories and for wild conspiracy theories.\\" The Atlantic wrote that the story \\"obviously plays on the worst fears of those who believe in secret Jewish cabals that run the world, but it's a pretty pathetic attempt at slander, even for Iran.\\" =Additional conspirators= Ben Swann, a Cincinnati news anchor for Fox affiliate WXIX-TV, has suggested on his personal YouTube channel that Adam Lanza was accompanied by another shooter; he has made similar claims about the Aurora shooting and the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting from earlier in 2012. Other conspiracy theorists have claimed that as many as four shooters were present. There is no credible evidence that any additional shooters were present at the event. Some such reports may have been influenced by confused early news reports of the events. =Relationship to LIBOR scandal= Other conspiracy theories have focused on the claim that Adam Lanza's father was an executive with GE Energy Financial Services. According to these theories, Lanza's father was supposed to testify before the Senate Banking Committee with information about the Libor scandal. However, no such hearings were scheduled. Similar claims had been made about the father of James Holmes, the convicted perpetrator of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting. =Timestamps of memorial sites= Conspiracy theories have claimed that various timestamps for creation dates, whois records, and Google caches of various memorial websites, fundraising sites, and Facebook were created before or immediately after the date and time of the shooting and are therefore \\"evidence\\" of a conspiracy or cover up. However, timestamps are frequently incorrect, particularly on search engines. Some timestamps are initially created and assigned to URLs that are then repurposed, meaning that a URL linked to a current event can have a much older date. =Alex Jones claims= In September 2014, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who runs the website InfoWars, which had previously claimed that the murders were a \\"false flag\\" attack perpetrated by the government, made a new conspiracy claim that \\"no one died\\" at Sandy Hook Elementary School because the Uniform Crime Reports showed no murders in Newtown for 2012, and that the victims were \\"child actors.\\"Dylan Baddour & W. Gardner Selby, Hillary Clinton correct that Austin's Alex Jones said no one died at Sandy Hook Elementary , PolitiFact (September 1, 2016).David Mikkelson, FBI Admits Sandy Hook Hoax?: Rumor: The FBI revealed that no murders occurred in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, proving the Sandy Hook massacre was an elaborate hoax, Snopes (February 7, 2015). This claim is false and misrepresents the FBI report. In reality, because the Connecticut State Police was the lead investigator after the attack, the Sandy Hook victims were included in Connecticut's statewide records (under \\"State Police Misc.\\") rather than under the Newtown statistics. In November 2016, Erica L. Lafferty, daughter of Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, the school principal who was shot and killed at Sandy Hook School, wrote open letters to then-President- elect Donald Trump (published in Medium and USA Today), calling upon him to denounce Jones,*Erica L. Lafferty, Denounce Sandy Hook Denier Alex Jones: My Open Letter to President-Elect Trump , Medium (November 16, 2017). *Marlow Stern, Erica Lafferty Lost Her Mother in Sandy Hook. Trump's Ties to Truther Alex Jones Disgust Her , Daily Beast (November 18, 2016). *Erica Lafferty, Mr. Trump, denounce Alex Jones: Sandy Hook principal's daughter , USA Today (November 25, 2016). after Trump had appeared on InfoWars during his presidential campaign and lavished praise on its presenter, saying that the conspiracy theorist had an \\"amazing\\" reputation and pledging not to let him down. On February 20, 2017, the Newtown School Board wrote to President Trump and urged him to recognize the murders of 26 people at Sandy Hook and to \\"remove your support from anyone who continues to insist that the tragedy was staged or not real.\\"Russell Blair, Trump Silent After Newtown Asks Him To Denounce Sandy Hook Deniers , Hartford Courant (April 4, 2017).Christopher Hoffman, Newtown tries—and so far, fails—to get Trump to acknowledge Sandy Hook massacre , Columbia Journalism Review (March 31, 2017). Trump did not respond to the letter. In March 2018, six families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, as well as an FBI agent who responded to the attack, filed a defamation lawsuit in Bridgeport Superior Court in Connecticut against Jones for his role in spreading conspiracy theories about the shooting. On April 16, 2018, parents of two other victims of the shooting sued Jones in Travis County, Texas (where Jones' media company is based), for $1 million each.Parents Of Children Who Were Killed In Sandy Hook Are Suing Alex Jones Over His Conspiracy Theories BuzzFeed News, April 17, 2018 The trial is expected to be scheduled by the end of 2020. =James Tracy= James Tracy, a former professor at Florida Atlantic University who taught a course on conspiracy theories, has suggested the shooting either did not actually occur or occurred very differently than accounted in mainstream reports, claiming political motives for the coverup. Florida Atlantic president Mary Jane Saunders issued a statement that Tracy's views were \\"not shared by\\" the university. In response to his comments, the university opened an investigation of Tracy, who had tenure. In December 2015, after the family of Noah Pozner – one of the children murdered at Sandy Hook – claimed that Tracy had harassed them, FAU moved to fire Tracy. Chan Lowe of the Sun-Sentinel speculated that the comments were a publicity stunt by Tracy. Tracy later declined an appearance on CNN with Anderson Cooper, suggesting that Cooper wanted to bring him and his family members harm by identifying him in a prior broadcast. The university fired Tracy on January 5, 2016, citing his refusal to file required paperwork related to outside employment for several years. Other sources have continued to claim that the entire event was a hoax. A video similarly questioning official accounts of the shooting received several million views on YouTube within a week of its posting, although the video has since been modified to display a disclaimer explaining that its creators \\"in no way claim this shooting never took place, or that people did not lose their lives.\\" A book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook was written by James Fetzer and Mike Palacek, claiming that the event was a Federal Emergency Management Agency drill and the government had created false death certificates to claim there were victims. Lenny Pozner, father of victim Noah Pozner, filed a defamation lawsuit against Fetzer and Palacek. Pozner won a summary judgement from the court in June 2019, with damages to be determined by trial in October. The book's publisher, Moon Rock Books, apologized to the Pozner family and agreed to take the book out of circulation at the end of June. On October 16, 2019, a jury awarded Leonard Pozner $450,000 for defamation by James Fetzer. Fetzer announced his intention to appeal against the decision. =Other conspiracy theorists and claims= On September 12, 2014, during a political debate, Colorado Republican Party candidate Tom Ready (who was running for Pueblo County Commission) was accused by his opponent, Sal Pace, of posting an article on his Facebook page claiming the Sandy Hook shootings \\"never happened\\". Ready responded: \\"Well, there is some question of whether it happened, Sal.\\" This was followed by more statements of the same tenor, prompting outraged yells from the audience. After allegedly receiving a death threat the next day, Ready reportedly apologized for his remarks. Other conspiracy theorists have tried to connect the shooting to references in popular culture. Prison Planet, a website owned by British conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson, mentioned that Newtown-based author Suzanne Collins wrote The Hunger Games books, in which 22 children are \\"ritualistically\\" killed, while 20 children were killed in the shooting. Others pointed out that \\"Sandy Hook\\" can be seen on a map in the 2012 Batman film The Dark Knight Rises despite Sandy Hook also being the name of the New Jersey peninsula just south of New York Harbor. This is what some conspiracy theorists refer to as predictive programming. Several conspiracy theorists have also claimed a six- year-old victim of the shooting subsequently appeared in a photograph with President Barack Obama. In fact, the child in the photograph is actually the victim's sister, wearing her deceased sister's dress. Analysis Writing about the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories, Benjamin Radford argued that most conspiracy theorists who allege contradictions in official accounts ignore contradictions in their own accounts, citing research from the University of Kent that conspiracy theorists selectively focus on or ignore particular details in order to fit their preferred narrative. The conspiracy theories have also been called evidence of \\"the need for a national debate on mental illness.\\" The debunking website Snopes ran an editorial debunking the \\"Sandy Hook Exposed\\" video, explaining how many of the theories make little sense, and answered many questions conspiracy theorists wanted answers to. Harassment by conspiracy theorists Gene Rosen, a Newtown resident who was reported to have sheltered six Sandy Hook students and a bus driver in his home during the shooting, has been subject to harassment online alleging he was complicit in a government coverup, among other things. Some journalists have cited such incidents as part of a \\"Sandy Hook Truther Movement\\" analogous to the 9/11 Truth movement. A writer for the Calgary Herald reported that the movement self-identifies as \\"Operation Terror.\\" In May 2014, Andrew David Truelove stole a memorial sign from playgrounds dedicated to victims Grace McDonnell and Chase Kowalski. He then went on to call the parents of Grace McDonnell, proclaiming that he stole the sign and that he believed their deaths were a \\"hoax\\". He was arrested on May 30, and the signs were found in his home. Truelove was convicted of the theft and sentenced to one year in prison. Robbie Parker, the father of victim Emilie Parker – after doing a CNN interview on the day after the shooting – became the target of conspiracy theorists, who claimed the interview was staged. Retrieved 2014-05-31. Parker has been attacked by theorists who believe he is a \\"crisis actor\\" and was \\"getting into character\\" before going on CNN to grieve over the loss of his child. In April 2016, Matthew Mills, a man from Brooklyn, accepted a plea agreement with prosecutors on one count of interfering with police arising from an incident in November 2015, when Mills angrily approached the sister of murdered teacher Victoria Sotowho is regarded as a heroine for her attempt to protect her students from the shooter in the Sandy Hook attackshoved a photograph in her face, \\"and began angrily charging that not only did the Sandy Hook tragedy not take place, but that Victoria Soto never existed.\\"Daniel Tepfer, Sandy Hook 'truther' gets suspended sentence , Connecticut Post (April 18, 2016). Mills entered an Alford plea and was thus found guilty; he was given a suspended sentence of one year in jail and two years' probation. In December 2016, Lucy Richards, a woman from Tampa, was charged with four counts of transmitting threats in interstate commerce for sending death threats to Lenny Pozner, whose son Noah was the youngest of 20 children murdered. Pozner has been particularly targeted by Internet trolls and conspiracy theorists because he has vocally fought back against them.Mike Wendling, Sandy Hook to Trump: 'Help us stop conspiracy theorists' , BBC News (April 2, 2017). Richards had been expected to plead guilty to one count of transmitting threats, with both the prosecution and defense to recommend a sentence of probation and house arrest. However, in March 2017, Richardswho was free on bondfailed to show up to court for a change-of-plea hearing and sentencing. An arrest warrant was issued, Richards' bond was revoked, and she was soon apprehended.Paula McMahon, Woman accused of threatening Sandy Hook parent jailed after she was a no-show for court , South Florida Sun-Sentinel (April 3, 2017). On June 7, 2017, Richards was sentenced to five months' imprisonment. Lenny Pozner, the father of Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner, founded an organization called the HONR Network, which takes legal action against harassers of Sandy Hook survivors and families. Wolfgang Halbig, a past contributor to Infowars, was arrested in January 2020 for unauthorized possession of personal information of Lenny Pozner. Halbig had illegally obtained Pozner's private information and attempted to dox Pozner by sending those to a long list of recipients. Under Florida law, unauthorized possession of such information carries a maximum prison term of one year.

Maneuvering to battle Following the Battle of Prairie Grove, December 7, 1862, General Thomas C. Hindman withdrew under cover of darkness back towards Van Buren, Arkansas. The Confederates reached Van Buren on 10 December, demoralized, footsore, and ragged. Hindman immediately began reorganizing his forces. Hindman found it impossible to forage General John S. Marmaduke's Cavalry Division in Northwest Arkansas, and so Marmaduke was ordered to move his command to Lewisburg, below Van Buren. Hindman's force was thus reduced and was continuing to diminish in strength daily due to desertions and a frightful increase of sickness, the latter caused by unprecedented hardships that the men were exposed during the retreat from Prairie Grove. Hindman decided that it was inadvisable to keep the main body of his army on the north side of the Arkansas River and moved it to the south side, with most going into camp in the vicinity of Fort Smith, Arkansas. One infantry regiment from General Fagan's brigade with a section of West's Arkansas Artillery, remained at Van Buren, and one regiment of cavalry, under Lieut. Col. R.P. Crump, was posted at Dripping Springs, to the north of Van Buren. Crump's force was instructed to picket at Oliver's north, and at corresponding points on all other roads leading toward the Northwest.United States. War Dept..

On December 28, at 10 a.m., Lieutenant-Colonel Crump reported by courier that Union forces were advancing on the Cove Creek road in heavy force of cavalry, infantry and artillery. A few minutes afterward, Brigadier General Cooper, who was at Scullyville, in the Choctaw Nation, from Fort Smith, reported by courier that a Federal cavalry force of three or four regiments, with artillery, under Colonel Phillips, had crossed to the south side of the river, at Fort Gibson, the preceding day. Immediately after, information was received by telegraph from a detachment of cavalry posted at Borland's, below Van Buren, on the north side of the Arkansas River, covering the roads from Fayetteville to Ozark and Clarksville, that a regiment of Federal cavalry was within of that position, moving south. General Fagan's brigade was on the march below Van Buren.

General Cooper was ordered to retire southward upon his depots of supplies, the nearest of which was Johnson's Station, on the Canadian, about from Fort Smith. Shaver's brigade was put under arms, and moved forward to the river opposite Van Buren. Frost was ordered back to Shaver's position, detaching enough artillery and infantry to hold the crossing at Strain's, below Van Buren; and orders were given to remove by boat and wagon, as rapidly as possible, the public property at Van Buren and Fort Smith.

As they approached the landing, West's battery, of Shaver's brigade, drove them back, killing and wounding several. Skirmishing continued there till nearly sunset, when the Federal infantry appeared, and two batteries of heavy rifled pieces opened from the commanding heights in and above the town. Meanwhile, a cavalry force pursued and captured Colonel Crump's train and part of a train laden with supplies for the wounded at Cane Hill, and also captured three steamboats, the Notre, which had grounded on a bar 1 mile below Van Buren, the Key West and Rose Douglass, which had been ordered down, but had stopped for some cause unknown on the south side of the river, opposite Strain's Landing. This was before there was time for Frost's detachment to reach that point. The steamers Eva and Arkansas, being still above Van Buren, were burned on Hindman's orders, after transferring to wagons all their freight for which transportation was available. About dark, artillery firing commenced at Strain's Landing, between Frost's detachment, posted there, and a Federal force on the opposite side, having field pieces of large caliber. It continued for two hours, until the Federal forces retired.United States. War Dept. The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union And Confederate Armies.

Aftermath Hindman removed all the public stores from Van Buren and Fort Smith for which he had transportation. Hindman reported that his whole force at the time of the Battle of Van Buren did not exceed 4,000. He believed that Federal Forces in and near Van Buren was not less than 7,000. With Federal Cavalry moving on both his flanks, Hindman determined to move his command southward, cross the river near Clarksville, unite with General Fagan's Brigade, and there take position.United States.

While Confederate Forces held on to Fort Smith through the summer of 1863, Hindman's retreat marked the last major Confederate effort to contest northwest Arkansas. Following the Prairie Grove Campaign, Northwest Arkansas became a virtual no-mans land. While the area would see cavalry raids, bushwacking and guerillia war for several years, including well after the formal end of the war, no large Confederate Army would ever again enter this area of the state.

Both ends could be rounded or pointed, but other designs were made with a blade attached to a handle. It can be represented with the top half red, reminiscent of the color of blood, in representations of human sacrifice and the rest white, indicating the color of the flint blade.El sacrificio humano en los Mexicas. It was the sign of the eighteenth day, the twentieth day of the month of the Aztec calendar and the beginning of one of the twenty trecenas of the tonalpohualli. The Tecpatl knife was traditionally used for human sacrifice by the Aztecs, but it also was the short-range weapon of the jaguar warriors. Although it may have seen only limited use on the battlefield, its sharp edges would have made it an effective sidearm. Mythical origin of Tecpatl Xipe Totec, carrying a bloody tecpatl. (Codex Borgia) Tecpatl, is one of the most complex iconographic symbols of Aztec mythology. This knife expresses multiple meanings that carry a complex view of the world which are closely associated with the notions of origin and human sacrifice. The Tecpatl (Flint) was born in the height of heaven shaped as a knife, and was thrown down by his brother, and it was destined to descend from heaven to earth. It falls in Chicomoztoc(The Place of the Seven Caves) primary array of peoples, fragmenting into 1600 pieces, and from those fragments a thousand and six hundred gods emerge, the first gods here on earth. These gods emerging from the Seven Caves are the Centzonmimixcoa (four snakes clouds). This is confirmed by another version of the myth where the Flint serves as a temporary event marker, appearing as a calendar date, as a carrier of the year Centzonmimixcoa are born: \\"In year 1 Tecpatl Centzonmimixcoa were born, Iztac Chalchiuhtlicue (She of the Jade Skirt) begat the fourhundreth mixcohua. Then they went into a cave; and upon entering, their mother gave birth to five more Mimixcoa\\".TECPATL: ORIGEN Y SACRIFICIO. In the version of the Legend of the Five Suns, Tecpatl becomes temporal marker of the birth of the Centzonmimixcoa, and the name of the mother goddess switches to Iztac Chalchiuhtlicue(She of the Jade Skirt). According to Bernardino de Sahagún and Diego Durán they present the homology between this myth and ritual. \\"Among the ornaments worn by the women representing Cihuacoatl at parties, they also brought a crib on their back, so to bring your child in it, and stood in the tianguis among the other women, and disappearing left the crib there . When the other women looked at what was in it, it was a flint and iron were sandeel , with which they killed those whom they sacrificed.\\" Meanwhile, Duran tells his priests\\" sought a child cot and put into it a flint knife with which they sacrificed the one they called the son of Cihuacoatl.\\" In the version where the Centzonmimixcoa are born from the Tecpatl, the mother's name is Citlalinicue. In the version that is temporary marker Tecpatl birth, the mother is Iztac Chalchiuhtlicue, and in rites the mother of Tecpatl is Cihuacoatl. Three different invocations of the primordial mothers: skirt stars, She of the Jade Skirt, the snake woman who is at once a warrior deity, Tecpatl mother of the fourhundreth Centonmimixcoa born, the first gods on earth, in Chicomoztoc, the womb of the peoples. Tecpatl in Aztec mythology Tecpatl (sacrificial knife), image based on the Codex Borgia In Aztec mythology, the tecpatl was sometimes drawn as a simple flint blade, sharpened with some notches on the edge, in the Codex Borgia it appears red.Día 18. Tecpatl(Cuchillo). Tecpatl was associated with Northern cardinal point (Mictlan).,Tlacatiliztonalli ‘Energía de nacimiento’ . the dark place of eternal stillness and rest of the dead. The ancient Anahuac, considered the Tecpatl as a symbol of Xiuhtecuhtli tletl (fire protector of the grass or fire protector of the year), being the oldest method to produce sparks(and fire) by colliding two flints. It also relates to Ehecatl, since in the codices it's represented by high winds, meaning that the air cuts like razor, so it represented xopantla ( spring ), the time of high winds. According to Diego Durán, the former Anahuac considered the tecpatl as the worst sign of the zodiac, because the men and women born under this sign were happy but prone to infertility. Tecpatl as calendrical symbol The image of the tecpatl was a lunar symbol and therefore ruled agricultural events. Their patron gods were: Chalchiuhtotolin and Tezcatlipoca. In the trecena of Ce Tecpatl(One Flint), the gods were Tonatiuh and Mictlantecuhtli. On day Ce Tecpatl(One Flint), there was a festival dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, patron god of Tenochtitlan.Tenochtitlan. Tecpatl Year 1 (1168): the Aztec people left their place of origin, Aztlán, to undertake a long and difficult journey through the arid northern lands, part of what is now known as Mexico City.El Sacrificio Humano entre los aztecas. Tecpatl as a tool for human sacrifice Sacrifice of a war captive (Image based on the Codex Magliabechiano) The tecpatl or sacrificial knife, was an important element in Aztec rituals. The tecpatl was used by Aztec priests to open the chest of the victims of human sacrifice to extract the heart that would feed the gods, in the hope that the offerings would bring blessings to mankind.ARTE AZTECA. The most widespread sacrificial procedure among Aztecs, was removal of the heart. There were different types of knives, some of them allude to human sacrifice, being carved as a skull silhouette, where the nose was used as the cutting edge of the weapon.El Sacrificio Humano entre los aztecas. In the few técpatls that have survived, there are some representations of deities in their handles. A famous pre- Columbian example is the carved image of a figure using circular plugs in its ears and a big bow ornament made out of feathers, which associates this figure with Tonatiuh, the sun god. Tonatiuh's arms appears to be holding the knife's blade. This particular knife, emphasizes the importance of human sacrifices to feed the gods, especially the sun god, who illuminates the earth and sustains life. Tecpatl in the Sunstone Representations of the tecpatl in the sun stone The flint knife, is also represented in the following sections of the Sun Stone: # The tongue of the central face representing Tonatiuh. # The date Ce Tecpatl (one flint), sculpted between the central solar ray and the image of Nahui Ocelotl(4 Jaguar). Here the flint carries a glyph of Tezcatlipoca. # The glyph Tecpatl, carved within the circle of twenty days. # The tongues sticking out of the anthropomorphic faces in profile emerging from the jaws of the two xiuhcoatl in the outer ring of the monument. # On the outside edge of the stone, alternating with star glyphs. Each of the latter also uses the tecpatl to represent rays of light (or fire) emitted by the stars. # On the Xihuitzolli (the royal diadem), sculpted between the central solar ray and the image of Nahui Ehecatl (4 Wind) quad. The center of the headband has a very similar shape to the knife that can be seen on other representations of the monument, and the tecpatl is commonly found in other representations of this device. Nahui Ollin and Tecpatl In the accounts written by Fray Gerónimo de Mendieta on the origin of Tecpatl: The Centzonmimixcoa were the first man- gods, \\"they shall be as gods who created mankind and subsequently be slaughtered at Teotihuacan, some by jumping into fire, the others by opening their chest with a flint knife, this in order that the new Sun has movement and life\\". This story is related to two main iconographic elements from Sunstone: one is the Flint Knife (Tecpatl), and the other is the glyph: Four Movement (Nahui Ollin) Aztec or Mixtec sacrificial knife, probably for ceremonial use only, in the British Museum.Website of the British Museum. Tecpatl and Mixcoatl – Tezcatlipoca In the version of the Legend of the Five Suns, as well as the fourhundreth, five more Centzonmimixcoa are born. The Sun god (Tonatiuh) sends these five Centzonmimixcoa to destroy their older siblings, but they do not offer any of their kill to the Sun god, or the Earth Lord(Tlaltecuhtli) . Among these five is Mixcoatl, who after destroying the fourhundreth Mimixcoa is given a white flint that came gushing out of Itzpapalotl's body. It was burned (dedicated to Itzpapalotl) and broken several times. From there first came the azure flint; the second time flowed white flint. They took the white and wrapped it in a blanket. The third time sprouted yellow flint; neither took only saw. The fourth time flowed red flint; neither took . The fifth time sprang the black flint; neither took. Mixcoatl worshiped the gods by offering the white flint, which he wrapped in another blanket; and carried it on his back and went to fight in the place named Comallan, carrying it as an offering to his god, Itzpapalotl. In Aztec codices, the myth goes that Tezcatlipoca changed his name to Mixcoatl in the second year after the flood and makes fire from two pieces of flint. Which would explain the reason why, in the Sun Stone, the Tecpatl is carrying the glyph of Tezcatlipoca. The Tecpatl, linked to the origin of the fire, is also identified as a symbol of the sun and stars. Tecpatl associated with the moon Técpatl represented on the moon Codex Borgia page 18. In the codices, the moon is usually shown on a framework of dark night, as a kind of vessel cross-cut and usually filled with a liquid form. The vessel appears to be formed by a crooked bone, and inside is almost always the figure of a rabbit, a tecpatl or sometimes a small snail. Sometimes the moon is represented in the same way as the sun, with rays, but with different colors and with a snail or tecpatl in the center.Algunos aspectos del culto a la luna en el México antiguo. In the Codex Borgia, the flint knife is imposed inside the lunar glyph replacing the rabbit. This substitution, undoubtedly refers to the relationship between the moon and death. The Legend of the Five Suns, the name of the moon god is Nahui be Tecpatl (Four-Flint knife). Anthropomorphizing Tecpatl Aztec sacrificial knife made out of flint, exhibit from Museo del Templo Mayor, in Mexico City. In other more elaborate representations in addition to the basic form, the tecpatl can appear anthropomorphized, with two to seven teeth and an eye in the central region, which has a pupil center and an eyebrow on top; this eye is similar to that shown in the image of mizquitli (death). Other times it was built into an elaborate handle made of wood or stone inlaid with turquoise and shell. Other times, the flint was represented deified bristling with teeth or fangs and jaws with one eye.La Estela De Los Soles O Calendario Azteca. A knife found in the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan, shows a profile of a face that presumably represents the carrier of the tecpatl year(a minor deity). Its teeth and eyes were accented with inlaid white flint and obsidian, a volcanic rock. As it is a sacred sacrificial knife it is symbolically related to Mictlan, the lower part of the universe where the emaciated beings live . Mictlan was associated with the color black and the tecpatl (sacrificial knife). This knife is associated with the black god Tezcatlipoca, who embodies an obsidian knife representing the black wind. As sacrificial knife, it is also associated with the North (the direction of death) and the flayed god Xipe Totec. Tecpatl represented as tongue or nose Mictlantecuhtli with tecpatls representing his nose and tongue (Codex Borgia, page 18). The knife inserted into the nasal cavity symbolizes \\"cut the air\\", which is a vital element in symbolizing death.Mexico-tenoch. The tongue in the form of an obsidian knife (tecpatl) exposed to outside, indicates the need to be fed with the magical substance that was human blood flowing from the heart.Los Aztecas II. In excavations of the Templo Mayor, 33 skull-masks representing Mictlantecuhtli (god of death) were found; made out of the rostral portion of human skulls, adorned with shell and pyrite to represent the eyes, and sacrificial knives to simulate nose and tongue.El sacrificio humano entre los mexicas. In the Codex Borbonicus, Xolotl's tongue is made out of flint and he is carrying another knife with his right hand. Tlaltecuhtli (Lord of the Earth), is found in various sculptures and manuscripts, with tecpatl representing the tongue of the deity. In the Sun Stone, the tongue of the central face of Tonatiuh is a tecpatl. In the Codex Borgia, Mictlantecuhtli (lord of the underworld) appears as an active sacrificer armed with an ax or a técpal, ready to draw the hearts of his victims, his nose and tongue accuse the form of sharp knives.Mictlantecuhtli y el mundo de los muertos. Tecpatl in Mexica worldview The Tecpatl was in the middle of Aztec mythology, it is in the center of the Sun Stone, and it was instrumental in the ritual to bring out the heart of the sacrificial victim, which allowed light to reach the heart of the victim and therefore, was a mediator between life and death, between the divine realm and the human, between heaven, earth and the underworld. Since flint had the potential to make fire, it was considered an expression of celestial starlight on earth.

The bridge carries Las Vegas Avenue and crosses 37th Street. The construction of the bridge was also central to the regeneration plan for the neighborhood. This bridge was conceived as representation of the effort and persistence of the community to overcome the convulsed situation that prevailed in the country at the time of construction. The municipality faced with the challenge to build a road connection in the Las Vegas Avenue, decided to design a bridge of exceptional character, a landmark. Description The bridge has three approached spans of 20.2 m length each and two cable-stayed spans of 121 and 60 m. The two main spans are supported by central stays continuous through a steel saddle on top of the tower. All stays converge at the top of the tower as a fan configuration, being one of the few cable-stayed bridges with this cable-stay arrangement. The deck plan is mostly straight with a constant width of 18.6 meters. The deck is a 2.4 m depth tri-cellular concrete box girder and it is suspended by the cable-stays spaced at 12 m. The deck is internally post-tensioned with longitudinal and transverse tendons. The 50 m high central tower is a reinforced concrete tower with a rectangular cross section and variable width in both directions. The pylon is inclined 5° to achieve a more dynamic visual experience and landmark character. The bridge is located in a seismic zone of average degree in Colombia, having calculated for an earthquake spectrum with a maxima acceleration of 5m/s2 . The total cost of the structure was approximately US$12 million. Construction Construction of the bridge began in 2001, and was successfully completed in July 2003. At the time of construction, the bridge was the second largest concrete cable-stayed bridge in Colombia.

The operation was led by Red Guards commander Mikhail Artemyevich Muravyov as part of the Soviet expeditionary force against Kaledin and the Central Council of Ukraine. The storming of Kiev (Kyiv) took place during the ongoing peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk (Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) on February 5–8, 1918 (January 23–26, old style). The operation resulted in the occupation of the city by Bolshevik troops and the evacuation of the Ukrainian government to Zhytomyr. Background The aim of the undeclared war of the Soviet Russia against Ukraine was to install the Soviet power. During winter of 1917/18 the revolutionary formations of Russia installed the Soviet power in guberniyas of Kharkiv, Katerynoslav and Poltava. Kiev was next. The general command directed onto Kiev was in hands of Mikhail Muravyov. On January 27, 1918 the government of Ukraine announced Kiev under a siege and appointed Mykhailo Kovenko as the military commandant of Kiev. With the nearing of the Soviet advancing forces the city's Bolsheviks instigated uprising at the Arsenal factory, which was extinguished in seven days on February 4, 1918. The bolshevik protest in the city greatly eased the advancement of the Soviet forces drawing several of Ukrainian formations out of the adjacent provinces. The Kiev garrison was greatly demoralized by bolshevik propaganda and the Soviet advances across the territory of Ukraine. None of regiments were in full capacity and some either announced their neutrality or were eager to side with bolsheviks.

The first evidence of medieval coats of arms is found in the Bayeux Tapestry from the 11th century, where some of the combatants carry shields painted with crosses. Coats of arms came into general use by feudal lords and knights in battle in the 12th century. By the 13th century arms had spread beyond their initial battlefield use to become a kind of flag or logo for families in the higher social classes of Europe. The use of arms spread to Church clergy, and to towns as civic identifiers, and to royally-chartered organizations such as universities and trading companies. In the 21st century, coats of arms are still in use by a variety of institutions and individuals. Military coats of arms and emblems were first required in navies and air forces to recognize naval fleets and squadrons. Nowadays Spanish military insignia are used for official wear or display by military personnel and Armed Forces units and organizations, including branches, commands, cops, brigades, divisions, regiments, battalions, centres et cetera. Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent (1915–2005), Chronicler King of Arms of Spain, said military objects and natural figures are the most common heraldic charges used in Spanish Armed Forces heraldry. Chimeric figures are also used but they are uncommon. Mister Cadenas y Vicent also noted there are too many wrongly located charges in Spanish military escutcheons.What is Heraldry? .

General Headquarters, its dependent divisions and other organisms or centres. Air Force emblems first appeared in 1913 displayed on the front part of the fuselage but they were not official until the 1920s. Most squadrons created after the Spanish Civil War didn't have an insignia until 1954, one year after the Pact of Madrid was signed by Spain and the United States. Since then all squadron insignias except the symbol belonged to García Morato Group were replaced. The use of Air Force emblems and badges increased with the introduction of patches on Military uniforms during the decade of the 1970s. An order of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force to regulate the patches was adopted in November 1995. José Ramón Pardo Onrubia and Carlos Bourdón García's book about Spanish Air Force symbols said it would be appropriate to standardize emblems and badges of units centres and organisms. The Air Force Emblem was granted by Royal Warrant Circular of April 1913. Authorities were looking for quality projects to avoid one old-fashioned design in the future. The chosen proposal, still in use today, was created by Princess and Infanta Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, wife of Spanish Infante and airman Alfonso, Duke of Galliera. Princess Beatrice drew two silver wings united by a red disc with the Spanish royal crown. This is likely Princess Beatrice, Egyptologist and drawer, would have based on the Egyptian scarab, the winged disc of the Burial site of Seti I or Maat's wings. In Spain the Air Force Emblem is known colloquially as Rokiski the last name of the engraver who created military pilot wings between 1939 and 1965. Pilot wings and other Air Force specialties are based on the Rokiski.Emblems . Spanish Air Force, accessed January 9, 2013.

Except the patches, all identification badges of units are also standardized by according to General Order no. 4, 7th May 2015, on use of badges of the Guardia Civil. This regulation reformed the previous General Order no. 35, 14th August 1997, modified by General Orders 47 of 1997, 31 of 1998, 2 and 8 of 1999, 2 and 13 of 2002, and 11 and 17 of 2003. These standardized badges are as follows: *Service badges, they comprise the shields linked to each specialty with a heraldic chief Azure with the monogram of the Civil Guard Or. They are the only compulsory to use. *Graduate of Civil Guard courses badges, almost identical to the first but with their chiefs Gules. *Function and merit badges, some of them are unstandardized. They are not obligatory. *Destiny badges, removed since 2015, represented the zones with the heraldic shields of Spanish regions or autonomous cities and a bordure Argent, general directorates and sub-directorates used a bordure Or.General Order no. 4, 7th May 2015, on use of badges of the Guardia Civil. All coats of arms have been regulated and standardized by the Notice 1/2014, January 28, of the Guardia Civil Assistant Operations Directorate, that updates Annex 2 of the General Order no. 10, of 22nd November 2012, on Guardia Civil Military Honours and complements the General Order no. 4, 7th May 2015. The Notice 1/2014 describes the official design of the coats of arms contained on the guindons of the territorial divisions, units, services and commands of the Guadia Civil. These coats of arms, with a few exceptions like the Traffic Grouping or the GREIM, have an Iberian escutcheon shape. In all cases are used as supporters the sword and the fasces (the elements of the emblem of the Guardia Civil) but both less inclined to highlight the heraldic shields. All of them also uses the Spanish royal crown as crest, the name of the unit or service depicted below the shield in a banderole and never show the heraldic chiefs with the monogram. There are two notable exceptions although they use standardized coats of arms on their guindons, the College of the Young Guards \\"Duke of Ahumada\\", that maintains its traditional heraldry, and the Non-Commissioned Officers and Guards Academy, that displays its motto on a second banderole and applies gothic lettering.Notice 1/2014, January 28, of the Guardia Civil Assistant Operations Directorate, that updates Annex 2 of the General Order no. 10, of 22nd November 2012.

History  Erenköy Girls High School was established 1911 in the Mansion of Nemizade Zihni Bey in the Kabasakal neighborhood of Istanbul. It was later renamed Model School for Girls () and moved to the Mansion of Rıdvan Pasha. In 1916, the school was finally named Erenköy Girls High School (). The school then moved to a mansion purchased for 7,500 gold coins by the Ministry of Education from Mabeyinci Faik Bey. The school dormitory was extended by purchasing the mansion of Hacı Hüseyin Pasha from its last owner Hatice Sultan (daughter of Murad V). Education continued at scattered sites after the school building burnt down on February 22, 1945. The school moved into the current building in the academic year 1954-55.

Panther Games specialises in developing operational level wargames for the PC Wargame market. History Panther Games was founded in 1985 by David O’Connor in Canberra, Australia. In the early years Panther Games initially focused on developing and producing board games and released three titles in the mid 80’s, Trial of Strength, Shanghai Trader and Warlords. However, the company shifted their focus to developing computer games in the late 1980s with the release of their first computer wargame, Fire Brigade, in 1988 on Mac, DOS, Atari and Amiga. Fire Brigade currently forms part of the historical collection of software; hardwere; trade and promotional materials that document the history of Apple Inc. and its contributions to the computer industry and society. This collection is currently housed at Museum Victoria, Melbourne.Reg. No: HT 13672 Following the success of Fire Brigade, Panther Games took a step into the mainstream games market with the releases of sci-fi adventure Alien Drug Lords and puzzle challenge game Cubit in 1991. In 1996 Panther Games decided to return to its wargame roots and instigated development of a new real-time computer game engine for a novel operational wargame series to be called Airborne Assault (AA).The use of a real-time engine without a hexagon grid for a wargame was novel as traditional computer wargames run on a turn-based system where there are dedicated phases for planning, movement and engagement. The AA engine (later rebranded Command Ops) allowed for planning, movement and engagement to be played in continues time and the hexagon grid was no longer needed to determine movement capabilities of units. Panther Games' AA game engine and the associated AI capabilities has notably been referenced in publications by Peter Perla at Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), Michael Peck at Defence News and the Digital Humanities at King's College London.Perla, Peter P. & Markowitz, Michael C. (January, 2009) Peck, Michael (10 August 2010) Peck, Michael (21 June 2012) Sabin, Philip (2010) The first title to be produced in the series was Airborne Assault: Red Devils over Arnhem (RDOA) and was released in 2002 through wargame publisher battlefront.com. However, in Europe, Panther Games used a different publisher, CDV Software Entertainment AG, and the title for the game was simply Airborne Assault. The second and third instalments of the AA series were released through a new publisher, Matrix Games, with Airborne Assault: Highway to the Reich (HTTR) coming out in 2003 and Airborne Assault: Conquest of the Aegean (COTA) in 2006. In 2010, Panther Games rebranded their long running games series to Command Ops and released their latest title, Command Ops: Battles from the Bulge (BFTB). In 2012, the first official expansion pack Panther Games has ever released came out titled, Command Ops: Highway to the Reich. This is an expansion pack for BFTB and covers content from the original two AA games. 18 October 2014, Panther Games in conjunction with Lock 'n Load publishing jointly announce Panther Games' move to Lock 'n Load publishing following the split between Panther games and Matrix Games. Following the announcement it was revealed Panther Games through Lock n' Load would be re- releasing Panther Games' successful 1985 board game Trial of Strength with a new edition. it would be the first time the board game has been re-released since its initial release in 1985. In addition, it was revealed Panther Games' new game engine, Command Ops 2, would be released through the publisher along with all subsequent data packs for the engine. This represented a new method of content delivery for the company. June 2015, Command Ops 2 goes public beta and the \\"Commander Pack\\" consisting of all five modual data packs for Command Ops 2 goes on sale 16 June 2015. =Professional services to the military= Parallel to its commercial wargame development, Panther Games also provides professional services to the military.

As his name suggests, Anselm originated from Meißen. He became a priest in or before 1245. In Prussia, which was still mainly inhabited by heathen Old Prussians, the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia had been created in 1243 by the papal legate William of Modena, along with bishoprics of Culm, Pomesania, and Samland. These four dioceses came under the rule of the appointed Archbishop of Prussia. Several bishops at that time, including Anselm, were priests of the Teutonic Order which undertook the ongoing Prussian Crusade in the East. Heinrich of Strateich, the first elected Bishop of Warmia, was unable to claim his office. On 28. August 1250Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie Anselm (Bischof von Ermland) in Valenciennes (Flanders), Anselm of Meissen was consacred by Petrus de Collemed (Pietro of Albano), and at least since 27. April 1251, Anselm was present in Warmia. The bishop ruled one-third of his exempt bishopric also as a secular ruler for his support. His status as a prince of the Holy Roman Empire was confirmed in the Golden Bull of Emperor Charles IV. The other part was governed by the Order, with the bishop having clerical jurisdiction there. The borders were drawn in 1254. This was confirmed by the Golden Bull of 1356. The chapter with 16 canons had the right to elect independently the bishop. It resided at Braunsberg (Braniewo), with the St. Andreas church having become the bishops cathedral in 1260. Following attacks by heathen Old Prussians in 1262, the see was eventually moved to Frauenburg in 1280 by Anselm's successor, Heinrich Fleming. In 1261, Pope Urban IV appointed Anselm as legate to Bohemia and Moravia, Riga, Gnesen and Salzburg. Anselm recruited Germans from lower Germany, Moravia and Silesia to settle in Prussia. During the Prussian uprising, he remained in Silesia, and also performed duties there, in Reichenbach, Breslau and in Olmütz (Olomouc). Anselm died in 1278 in Elbing, where he was buried in the St. Anna chapel in the castle of Elbing.

The Livonian Order was decisively defeated by the residents of Riga allied with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania under command of Vytenis. In 1296 a civil war broke out in Terra Mariana between burghers of Riga and the Livonian Order. Johannes III von Schwerin, Archbishop of Riga, unsuccessfully attempted to mediate the dispute. As the conflict grew, Johannes III joined the cause of the Riga residents, but was defeated and taken prisoner. In March 1298, Riga concluded an alliance with pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was a subject of a Catholic crusade by the Teutonic Knights and Livonian Order. The Lithuanians, commanded by Grand Duke Vytenis, invaded Livonia and besieged Karkhus (Karksi). Once the castle fell, the Lithuanians looted, massacred, and took many prisoners. The defensive Livonian forces engaged the Lithuanians on the Gauja River. At first it seemed that the knights were winning the battle, but Vytenis vigorously counterattacked with reinforcements from the Archbishop and dealt a decisive defeat. Livonian Grand Master Bruno and komtur of Fellin were killed. According to different sources, either 60 or 20–22 noble knights were killed in the battle. If indeed it was 60, then the battle would be comparable to the Battle of Saule in terms of casualties. If about 20 knights were killed, it would still be in the top 10 defeats suffered by the Teutonic and Livonian forces in the 13th century. On June 28, the Livonian Order received reinforcements from the Teutonic Knights and defeated residents of Riga and Lithuanians near Neuermühlen. According to inflated numbers reported by Peter von Dusburg, some 4,000 Rigans and Lithuanians died at Neuermühlen. The knights proceeded to besiege and capture Riga. After Eric VI of Denmark threatened to invade Livonia to assist Archbishop Johannes III, a truce was reached and the conflict was mediated by Pope Boniface VII. However, the conflict was not resolved and the alliance between Lithuania and Riga continued for another fifteen years.

It signified the official adoption of Christianity by Lithuania, the last pagan country in Europe. This event ended one of the most violent processes of Christianization in European history. History Romuva sanctuary in Prussia =Early contacts with Eastern Orthodox Christianity= Lithuanians' contacts with the Christian religion predated the establishment of the Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century. The first known record of the name Lithuania (Litua), recorded in the Annals of Quedlinburg in 1009, relates to Chalcedonian missionaries led by Bruno of Querfurt, who baptised several rulers of the Yotvingians, a nearby Baltic tribe. However, Lithuanians had more active contacts with the Kievan Rus' and subsequent Eastern Slavic states, which had adopted Eastern Orthodox Christianity following the Christianization of Kievan Rus' in the 10th century. As the dukes of Lithuania extended their dominion eastwards, the influence of the Slavic states on their culture increased. Their subordinates and the people followed their example, borrowing, for instance, many of the East Slavic versions of Christian names in the 11th - 12th centuries. This borrowing became increasingly widespread among the pagan population in Aukštaitija, though much less so in Samogitia. The influence of Orthodox Christianity on pagan Lithuanian culture is evidenced in about one-third of present-day Lithuanian surnames which are constructed from baptismal names are Old Church Slavonic in origin.

Rowell. Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-central Europe, 1295-1345. Cambridge University Press, 1994. Page 149. =Baptism of Mindaugas= The emergence of a monastic state of the Livonian Order around the Lithuanian borders made it rather urgent to choose a state religion. The first Lithuanian Grand Duke to adopt Western Christianity was Mindaugas, although his nephew and rival Tautvilas had done that earlier, in 1250. The first translations of Catholic prayers from German were made during his reign and have been known since.For instance, the initial verse of the Trinitarian formula in Lithuanian, as well as in Latvian and Prussian, is presented as vardan Dievo Tėvo, i.e. \\"in the name of God the Father\\", in contrast to the common version \\"in the name of Father\\". It shows the influence of German Arianism, which used the denomination Got Vater, on the earliest Lithuanian liturgy. The Pope Innocent IV bull regarding Lithuania's placement under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome, Mindaugas' baptism and coronation In 1249, Tautvilas' ally Daniel of Halych attacked Navahradak, and in 1250, another ally of Tautvilas, the Livonian Order, organized a major raid against Nalšia land and Mindaugas' domains in Lithuania proper. Attacked from the south and north and facing the possibility of unrest elsewhere, Mindaugas was placed in an extremely difficult position, but managed to use the conflicts between the Livonian Order and the Archbishop of Riga in his own interests. In 1250 or 1251, Mindaugas agreed to receive baptism and relinquish control over some lands in western Lithuania, for which he was to receive a crown in return. Mindaugas and his family were baptised in the Catholic rite in 1250 or 1251. On July 17, 1251 Pope Innocent IV issued a papal bull proclaiming Lithuania a Kingdom and the state was placed under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Mindaugas and his wife Morta were crowned at some time during the summer of 1253, and the Kingdom of Lithuania, formally a Christian state, was established. Even after becoming a Catholic, King Mindaugas did not cease sacrificing to his own gods.S. C. Rowell Page 120 After Mindaugas repudiated Christianity and expelled all the Christians from Lithuania in 1261, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost its status as a Western Christian state. Despite the ruling family's baptism, Lithuania had not become a truly Christian state, since there were no fruitful efforts to convert its population; Lithuanians and Samogitians stood firmly for their ancestral religion.

Page 430. \\"For Gediminas and Algirdas, retention of paganism provided a useful diplomatic tool and weapon... that allowed them to use promises of conversion as a means of preserving their power and independence\\".Muldoon, James. Varieties of Religious Conversion in the Middle Ages. University Press of Florida, 1997. Page 140. Grand Duke Algirdas had pursued an option of 'dynamic balance'. Throughout his reign he teased both Avignon and Constantinople with the prospects of a conversion;Davies, Page 430 several unsuccessful attempts were made to negotiate the conversion of Lithuania.Muldon, Page 137 To avoid further clashes with the Teutonic Order, in 1349, Lithuanian co-ruler Kęstutis started the negotiations with Pope Clement VI for the conversion and had been promised royal crowns for himself and his sons. Algirdas willingly remained aside of the business and dealt with the order in the Ruthenian part of the state. The intermediary in the negotiations, Polish King Casimir III, made an unexpected assault on Volhynia and Brest in October 1349 that ruined Kęstutis' plan. During the Polish- Lithuanian war for Volhynia, King Louis I of Hungary offered a peace agreement to Kęstutis on 15 August 1351, according to which Kęstutis obliged himself to accept Christianity and provide the Kingdom of Hungary with military aid, in exchange of the royal crown. Kęstutis confirmed the agreement by performing a pagan ritualkilling a bull by throwing a knife at it to convince the other side. In fact, Kęstutis had no intentions to abide the agreement and ran away on his way to Buda. Kęstutis: was he a proponent or opponent of the Christianization, accessed on 01-07-2007 By the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had emerged as a successor to Kievan Rus in the western part of its dominions.Daniel Z. Stone. The Polish-Lithuanian State, 1386-1795. University of Washington Press, 2001. . Page 3; Paul Robert Magocsi. A History of Ukraine. University of Toronto Press, 1996. Page 67. Although its sovereign was pagan, the majority of the population was Slavic and Orthodox. To legitimize their rule in these areas, the Lithuanian royalty frequently married into the Orthodox Rurikid aristocracy of Eastern Europe. As a result, some Lithuanian rulers were baptised into Eastern Orthodoxy either as children (Švitrigaila) or adults. The first one was Vaišelga, son and heir of Mindaugas, who took monastic vows at an Orthodox monastery in LavrashevFollowing the Tracks of a Myth, Edvardas Gudavičius near Novgorodok and later established a convent there.S.C. Rowell. Page 149. =Christianization by Jogaila and Vytautas= The final attempt to Christianize Lithuania was made by Jogaila. Jogaila's Russian mother urged him to marry Sofia, daughter of Prince Dmitri of Moscow, who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy and to make Lithuania a fief of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.A. Thomas Lane. Lithuania: Stepping Westward. Routledge, 2001. Page XXI. That option, however, was unrealistic and unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Order. Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a Catholic and marry Queen Jadwiga of Poland. On these and other terms, on 14 August 1385, at the castle of Krėva, Jogaila agreed to adopt Christianity, signing the Act of Krėva. Władysław II Jagiełło was duly baptised at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on 15 February 1386 and became king of Poland. The royal baptism was followed by the conversion of most of Jogaila's court and knights,Kłoczowski, 54-57. as well as Jogaila's brothers Karigaila, Vygantas, Švitrigaila and cousin Vytautas. Jogaila sent Dobrogost, Bishop of Poznań, as ambassador to Pope Urban VI with a petition for the erection of an episcopal see at Vilnius and the appointment of Andrzej Jastrzębiec to fill it. \\"The Baptism of Lithuania\\" by Jan Matejko Jogaila returned to Lithuania on February 1387. The baptism of nobles and their peasants was at first carried out in the capital Vilnius and its environs. The nobility and some peasants in Aukštaitija were baptized in spring, followed by the rest of the Lithuanian nobility. The parishes were established in ethnic Lithuania and the new Vilnius Cathedral was built in 1387 in the site of a demolished pagan temple. According to the information of disputed accuracy provided by Jan Długosz, the first parochial churches were built in Lithuanian pagan towns Vilkmergė, Maišiagala, Lida, Nemenčinė, Medininkai, Kreva, Haina and Abolcy, all belonging to the Jogaila's patrimony. On 19 April 1389, Pope Urban VI recognized the status of Lithuania as a Roman Catholic state. Samogitia was the last ethnic region of Lithuania to become Christianized in 1413, following the defeat of the Teutonic Order in the Battle of Grunwald and the Peace of Thorn and its subsequent return to the Lithuanian control. In November 1413, Vytautas himself sailed Neman River and Dubysa, reached the environs of Betygala, where he baptised the first groups of Samogitians.Dualistinis lietuvių tautybės susidarymas ir trialistinis Lietuvos krikšto pobūdis Dr. Aleksandras Vitkus In 1416, the construction of eight first parochial churches was started. The Diocese of Samogitia was established on 23 October 1417 and Matthias of Trakai became the first Bishop of Samogitia. The cathedral was built in Medininkai around 1464.  Aftermath  Ethnic Lithuanian nobles were the main converts to Catholicism, but paganism remained strong among the peasantry. Pagan customs prevailed for a long time among the common people of Lithuania and were covertly practiced. There had been no prosecution of priests and adherents of the old faith. However, by the 17th century, following the Counter-Reformation (1545-1648), the Roman Catholic faith had essentially taken precedence over earlier pagan beliefs. The conversion and its political implications had lasting repercussions for the history of Lithuania. As the majority of the population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania outside Lithuania proper was Orthodox and the elite gradually converted to Roman Catholicism, religious tensions increased. Some of the Orthodox Gediminids left Lithuania for Muscovy, where they gave rise to such families as the Galitzine and the Troubetzkoy. The Orthodox population of present-day Ukraine and eastern Belarus often sympathized with the rulers of Muscovy, who portrayed themselves as the champions of Orthodoxy. These feelings contributed to such reverses as the Battle of Vedrosha, which crippled the Grand Duchy and undermined its position as a dominant power in Eastern Europe. On the other hand, the conversion to Roman Catholicism facilitated Lithuania's integration into the cultural sphere of Western Europe and paved the way to the political alliance of Lithuania and Poland, finalized as the Union of Lublin in 1569.

Version 1.0 of the game soft launched in the Australasia region on April 11, 2013. A more complete version of the game (Version 1.11) was released internationally on August 3. The game is available under the freemium business model. An Android release was released in 2014. The game's main selling points are its uniquely adapted touchscreen-specific control scheme and \\"console quality\\" graphics. Although the graphics were generally praised by critics, the game received mixed to negative reviews, with much criticism aimed at the in-app purchase system and repetitive gameplay. Gameplay The game offers two methods of control. The first, and the one upon which the game was primarily marketed, is a system developed specifically for the game and uniquely adapted for touchscreen devices. To shoot, the player taps the screen with two fingers and the player character fires at the middle point between the two taps. To zoom, the player pinches and expands their fingers on the screen. To move, the player taps on the screen where they want to go and the character automatically moves around obstacles until he reaches the designated spot. To strafe, the player swipes left or right on the screen using two fingers. To look around, the player swipes in any direction with one finger, although there is also a shortcut button for instant 180 degree turns. To switch weapons, the player taps on the character's weapon. A more traditional touchscreen first-person shooter setup is also available, with two virtual joysticks, one for moving, one for shooting. Each level in the game features two types of play mode; attack and defend. Game progression is based upon a crafting system, which also offers upgrades for the character's weapons. As the game advances, certain levels can only be played if the player has crafted the correct item. For example, to craft the car, which is necessary to get to the third section of the game, the player needs a lug nut, which is only found in \\"The Shore\\" level. However, \\"The Shore\\" can only be played after the player has crafted a weapon capable of zooming. Such a weapon can only be crafted after the player has collected necessary components, which are randomly awarded on various other levels. The items necessary to upgrade and craft new items are randomly awarded to the player at the end of each level, based upon the number of stars they have achieved. Operating on a five star scale, scoring one to three stars results in \\"common\\" items, while scoring four or five stars results in a \\"rare or better\\" item. Pictured is the player character fighting an enemy in the game's post-apocalyptic world. The game uses multiple currencies. Energy (in the form of \\"Gas cans\\") is necessary to play the game. Each time the player plays a level, their gas total drops by one. When there is no gas left, the player can no longer play, and can either buy more gas using Gold or must wait until their supply has automatically replenished. \\"Black\\" is necessary for crafting new items and upgrading weapons, and is awarded at the end of each level. If the player does not have enough Black to craft an item necessary for advancing the story, they must play previous levels, or purchase Black using Gold. \\"Flares\\" can be used at the end of each level to raise the player's score by one star. Flares can be randomly awarded during the game or purchased using Gold. \\"Silver\\" is necessary to activate \\"Charlotte's Bounty\\", which randomly awards a single prize in the form of an item, a weapon, a gas can, a flare or more silver. Silver is awarded randomly at the end of a level. \\"Gold\\" can be used to purchase any of the other currencies, and is only available using real-world money. Plot The game is set in 2021. Ten years prior to the opening of the game, 3,000 blackbirds fell out of the sky in Beebe, Arkansas. As scientists proved at a loss to explain how or why the birds had died, similar phenomenon began to occur all over the world. People began to panic, fearing Armageddon was at hand. Several months later the \\"Black\\" came. A thick black oil washed in to coastlines, turning anyone who came into contact with it into zombie- like creatures whose goal is to drag the living down into the Black. The game begins with the unnamed protagonist on a boat, which is subsequently attacked by several oil creatures. He makes it ashore and is about to be overwhelmed by creatures, when he is saved by a woman named Charlotte. Together, they head to a nearby house where they find a note from the presumed-dead owner explaining how to turn the Black into fuel for vehicles. They follow the instructions and get an old car working. Inside the car, they find another note from the man explaining he has left an old boat in a nearby fishing village. They head there, and find another note in the boat. The man speculates that the origin of the Black may be an oil rig off the coast and they should get to his old speedboat on the next island. In the speedboat, another note explains that the Black may be stopped if explosives are dropped down the borehole of the rig. To do so, however, they will need a helicopter, which they can find on the roof of a nearby hospital. They get to the helicopter and head out towards the rig, spotting another helicopter flying away from the island. They tune in to its radio frequency and learn it is on a rescue mission but has reported no signs of life on the islands. As they land on the rig, Charlotte reveals that the old man was her father. They fling the explosives into the borehole, but rather than sealing the spillage of Black, it opens the leak even more, and hundreds of oil creatures begin to scale the rig as an unmoving Charlotte watches them approach her. Later that day, the narrator has returned to the old man's house. He sees a helicopter flying overhead, which drops a package containing a note. The note commends him on his attempt to seal the borehole, and promises to return and evacuate him once it has refueled. Development The game was developed by Scattered Entertainment, led by Battlefield producer Ben Cousins. With the aim of appealing to \\"hardcore players,\\" the developers designed the control scheme specifically for use on touch-sensitive devices. According to Cousins, \\"We were unsatisfied with the FPSes on mobile devices, and I think from our research, I think a lot of the potential audience who are really interested in the genre have a phone or a tablet, and they're not satisfied with what they've got out there. [We've developed] a control system which is designed for touchscreens that you can play with just one hand, with just two fingers in fact on one hand, and one that really fluidly fits in with the way that we hold these devices and the usage patterns of these devices. So we're really proud that we've created a control system which kind of unlocks the potential of this genre on the platform.\\" In January 2013, Game Informer Matt Miller said the game was \\"one of the more ambitious mobile titles we've seen. I'm excited to see if the team can match its impressive visuals and narrative depth with equally enthralling gameplay.\\" Some of the story elements in the game's prologue were based on a real incident which occurred in Arkansas in 2011, \\"when thousands of black birds fell from the sky.\\" Reception The Drowning received mixed to negative reviews. It holds an aggregate score of 55 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on nineteen reviews, and 52.29% on GameRankings, based on fourteen reviews. Gamezebo's Joe Jasko was one of the few critics to give the game a positive review, scoring it 4 out of 5 and praising the arena-based nature of the gameplay and the control scheme. Although he was critical of the energy system, writing \\"the whole inclusion of this energy system just seems a bit archaic to the game's otherwise pretty fair and generous freemium model,\\" he concluded positively; \\"While other mobile FPS games might still be drowning in a sea of shoddy touchscreen controls, The Drowning offers just enough moments of ingenuity and potential insights to these traditional issues that gamers will always be able to keep coming up for refreshing breaths of air.\\" 148Apps' Carter Dobson scored the game 3 out of 5. His main criticisms pertained to the integration of the IAP system into the gameplay; \\"the actual game at the heart of The Drowning is largely a shallow free-to-play machine. The missions, involving both arena- based attack segments and defence missions a la CoD Zombies, are all about two minutes in length. They're friendly for pick-up-and-play gameplay, but are mostly just empty calories. The game is also always concerned with pressuring the player into obtaining more randomly-obtained items for crafting, trying to sell more MobaCoins to spend on gas cans to keep playing, and flares to get rarer items from levels where the maximum reward level is usually incredibly difficult to obtain. It's not really possible to actually enjoy The Drowning for what it is.\\" Slide to Play's Tyler Feasel scored the game 2 out of 4, criticizing the arena-based gameplay, and arguing that a standard campaign mode would have been preferable. He was especially critical of the energy system; \\"To wait 30 minutes to \\"earn\\" a few minutes of gameplay is deflating and leaves the experience with a sour taste.\\" He concluded that \\"The Drowning doesn't feature a solid story or nuanced gameplay, but its solid arcade- shooting mixed with a nice amount of unlocks helps deliver a positive gameplay experience. Unfortunately this fun is crippled by an unbalanced timer system that limits game time in favor of an in-app purchase.\\" MacLife's Carter Pereira scored the game 2.5 out of 5, writing \\"While certainly enjoyable at times, The Drownings free-to-play implementation hampers the game to an inexcusable degree.\\" Chris Carter of Destructoid scored the game 5 out of 10, and was critical of the control system, writing \\"the overly-simplistic layout does not work.\\" However, his strongest criticisms were in relation to the IAP system, writing \\"in the hands of another developer, The Drowning would have been something special. Without the energy mechanic and constant drip-fed weapon and item parts, I could easily see myself destroying an entire afternoon blasting apart zombies.\\" Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead was even more critical. Scoring the game 4 out of 10, he called the control system \\"a clumsy and unnatural way to play an FPS.\\" He was also heavily critical of the IAP system's integration into the core gameplay; \\"This is a game that cannot wait to start asking you to pay, and has at least four interlocked currencies designed to make you feel like you should. To assume that sort of aggressive monetisation isn't a factor in the game's obstructive, uphill design, which ekes out progress to non-paying players painfully slowly, is to be willfully blind to how this sort of thing works.\\" He concluded that The Drowning \\"is a transaction machine first, a headline-grabbing control scheme second and an actual game a distant third.\\" Pocket Gamer's Peter Willington was equally critical, also scoring the game 4 out of 10, and writing \\"first-person shooters today are far more complex than The Drowning ever attempts to be. [...] Playing The Drowning is like travelling back in time to the Quake era - walk about a level and shoot everything until you win.\\" He called the game \\"a failed experiment,\\" writing \\"The game ultimately fails at reinventing first- person shooter controls [...] fails at opening up the first-person shooter to the freemium model [...] fails at being a decent first-person shooter [...] It suffers from a paucity of enemy types, locations that barely change the way you play, minimal peripheral awareness, and some of the most rote shooting available on a touchscreen device.\\" Film adaptation On September 23, 2014 Deadline Hollywood reported that Radar Pictures had hired Olympus Has Fallen writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt to adapt the game into a movie.

He attended the University of South Carolina (2009–2012). He was drafted in the 6th round of the 2013 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at the University of South Carolina. Since 2017, he has been the head football coach at Beaufort High School in Beaufort, South Carolina. He now is the head coach for South Pointe High School in Rock Hill, SC. Early years A native of Charlotte, North Carolina, Holloman began his high school football career at Independence High School in 2005, where he won 2 North Carolina High School Football State Championships and was a teammate of future NFL player Hakeem Nicks. In his sophomore year, he had 96 tackles and four interceptions. As a junior, he had over 50 tackles with 2 interceptions, while also playing quarterback. As a senior, he transferred to South Pointe High School in Rock Hill, South Carolina, where he was a teammate of future NFL players Stephon Gilmore and Jadeveon Clowney. He collected 2 interceptions, 3 forced fumbles and received All-state honors. The school finished with a perfect 15-0 record and won the South Carolina AAAA Division II championship. Regarded as a four- star recruit by Rivals.com, he was listed as the No. 10 outside linebacker prospect in his class. College career In 2008, Holloman decommitted from Clemson University after head coach Tommy Bowden was fired and accepted a football scholarship from the University of South Carolina. As a freshman, he was a backup at strong safety, playing in 13 games (2 starts), while registering 30 tackles and one interception. As a sophomore, he was named the starter at strong safety after the fourth game, ranking third on the team with a career-high 69 tackles, while posting 2 interceptions (second on the team). As a junior, he began the season at the \\"Spur\\" hybrid linebacker position, but switched to strong safety after 2 games. He missed 2 games and was fifth on the team with 51 tackles (33 solo), while making 4 tackles for loss, one interception and 4 passes defensed. As a senior, he was moved back to the \\"Spur\\" position, where in 13 games he finished fourth on the team with 57 tackles (8 for loss), 3 interceptions (tied for the team lead), 4 passes defensed, 2 sacks and 2 forced fumbles. Professional career Holloman was selected in the 6th round (185th overall) of the 2013 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. During the preseason, he showed a knack for creating turnovers, returning a 75-yard interception for a touchdown in the Pro Football Hall of Fame game against the Miami Dolphins. After being the backup for Justin Durant during the first six games, he missed seven games while recovering from a spine contusion he suffered in practice. Holloman returned to play in the 15th game of the season against the Green Bay Packers, with the Cowboys forced to start him at middle linebacker because of injuries, even though he had never played the position before. He would start three games, with his best production coming in the season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the team with 11 tackles and two sacks. During the preseason game against the Baltimore Ravens on August 16, 2014, Holloman's neck was injured (his second neck injury playing football) in the fourth quarter. After visiting with doctors, he was subsequently diagnosed with a narrow spinal column condition (cervical spinal stenosis), which forced him to announce his early retirement on August 25. Personal life In 2014, he returned to the University of South Carolina to be a video assistant for the football team. In 2015, he was hired to be the defensive backs coach at Beaufort High School. In 2016, he was promoted to defensive coordinator. On November 13, 2017, he was named the new head coach, succeeding Mark Clifford, who stepped down after 14 years of service. Then, on February 4, 2019, he was named head coach at his alma mater, South Pointe High School, following in the footsteps of former coach, Strait Herron.

It is one of the best preserved medieval castles in Latvia. At the time of the Russo-Turkish War from 1877 to 1878, there was a camp for Turkish prisoners of war, many of whom settled here permanently. Here the Latgale artillery regiment was located. During the Second World War infirmary of the German army was located here. A military hospital of the Red Army was placed here after August 1944. History The first written reference of the Krustpils dates from 1237, when the Archbishop of Riga built a castle named Kreutz. In 1359, the Livonian order took seven castles belonging to the Riga Archbishopric, being Krustpils among them. During the Livonian war in 1559 the castle was devastated. When the Livonian state was dissolved, Krustpils became property of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1561 to 1772, while the opposite Jēkabpils was part of the Duchy of Courland and Zemgale. The difference between the Latgalian language and the Selonian dialect of the inhabitants on either side of the Daugava River remains as of today. In 1585, Stephen Báthory of Poland-Lithuania granted a large area which included Krustpils to general Nikolai von Korff, whose family owned the castle until the Latvian agrarian reforms of 1920 came into effect. As Krustpils castle became a residence of landlords, it gradually lost its medieval character. In the 18th century the castle got a representative look when Baroque elements were added to exterior of the castle. Krustpils castle together with other buildings of this complex was transferred to the Latvian army after 1920. Economic recovery was effected by the opening of the railway line Riga-Dvinsk in 1861 and the line Ventspils-Ribinska in 1904. Krustpils in 1920 received then its town charter. In 1932 a sugar factory was opened, and in 1935 Krustpils already counted for 3,658 inhabitants, of whom 53% were Latvians. In 1962 Krustpils was eventually incorporated into the town of Jēkabpils. During the Soviet times regiments of Soviet army were located in the castle such as the 16th regiment of long-range intelligence aviation and main storehouses of the 15th air regiment.

Background  In the Christian Broadcasting Network interview with Kristi Watts, Williams said that her relationship with God began in 2004, when her son at six months' old died of a heart condition. In addition, Williams noted how the Bible said that we are as Christian's to live the life of Christ, and that we partake in his suffering. So, Williams' gave the suffering of her sons' death over to God, and she told that he worked it for her good. This allowed her to have a faith not like King Saul rather King David, which is not about ourselves, but one focused on God. Lastly, Williams' noted the more grace that we have received from God, means that we need to give and show more of it as well. Heather Williams tells CCM Magazine's Caroline Lusk that the album process was akin to \\"'a birthing process...long and painful.'\\" Furthermore, Williams highlighted that \\"'Getting to work with Jamie Moore and Chuck Butler definitely grew me as an artist. I like to be challenged.'\\" Williams put the spotlight not on herself, but onto God, when she said \\"'I'm an ordinary girl who God saved...I don't want people to look to me...but to God. You don't have to be a musician, but give Him what you have. If we have Christ in our life and we've experienced that salvation we need to be sharing it.'\\"  Composition  ;\\"Hallelujah\\" The song was written from the prayer that Williams' wrote, where she wanted \\"Jesus please come, please come today,\\" and this was within a year of her sons' death and while she was pregnant with her daughter. ;\\"God Is Still God\\" The song comes about because God is constant in our lives and he can bring us through anything if we would let him.  Critical reception  Alpha Omega News' Ken Wiegman said that \\"My thoughts on \\"This Time Around\\" have changed as I have dug deeper into the 'who' of Heather Williams. As I read more, and learned of her struggles in life, I gained a greater appreciation for the lyrical content of the album.\\" In addition, Wiegman affirmed that he \\"cannot understate the potential impact of Williams’ testimony and her ability to put it to words and music. It is a blessing that such a person would share their deepest emotions in such an expressive way.\\" Christianity Today's Kristin Garrett noted that \\"Coming from a background of significant struggle, she recognizes Christ's faithfulness with complete authenticity on her first full-length album. Themes of \\"praise through pain\\" come and go in the Christian music industry, but Williams' vocal personality makes this concept anything but trite. Her belted alto and alternative style resemble the power of artists like Kelly Clarkson, and the relatability [sic] of her lyrics make up for lack of poetic expression.\\" Cross Rhythms' Simon Eden wrote that Heather Williams comes \\"With a strong powerful voice, the songs are not exciting but are easily accessible adult pop.\\" Indie Vision Music's Jonathan Andre illustrated how that \\"This is an album that has taken me by surprise. Every song on the album is sung with such passion and honesty, with Heather wearing her heart on her sleeve. Opening up cannot be easy, and from the testimony, it can be seen that it was very hard for her to do so. Nevertheless, this album encourages, hopes, dreams, lives up to every expectation that one could have of it. This is an album that you shouldn’t just buy on a whim. This is a beautifully thought album with amazing lyrics and reflective tunes.\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Jen Rose said that \\"At its best, This Time Around celebrates personal redemption in a fresh, powerful way and unveils her talent and passion. Though not a perfect record, it boasts a number of standout songs that set her apart in the CCM scene and reveals an artist with lots of future potential. For those looking for anthems of overcoming or something fun to chase the darker days away, this debut is worth checking out and establishes Heather Williams as an artist to watch.\\" New Release Tuesday's Kevin Davis wrote that \\"Heather Williams has the greatest voice I've heard this year, her vocals are so strong and pure. Musically and lyrically, her album This Time Around is brilliant. Look out GMA Dove Awards, a great new artist, female vocalist and stellar pop/contemporary album is on the way. Heather Williams is my choice as \\"the voice\\" in Christian music. This album is a 5 star work of art that brings me closer to God.\\"  Track listing References ;Footnotes Category:2011 albums Category:Fair Trade Services albums ","title":"This Time Around (Heather Williams album)"},{"id":"38239187","text":"Vovkovyntsi () is an urban-type settlement in the Derazhnia Raion (district) of Khmelnytskyi Oblast in western Ukraine.

Life Alessandro Ghigi was born in Bologna on 9 February 1875. He attended the University of Bologna, graduating with a degree in Natural Sciences. In 1900 he participated in founding the Emilian society Pro Montibus et Sylvis. He was made a Doctor of Zoology in 1902, teaching at the Agricultural secondary school in Bologna and at the University of Ferrara. In 1922 he became professor of zoology at Bologna, where he directed the Institute of Zoology. He was rector of the University of Bologna from 1930 to 1943 . In 1911 he was one of the founders of the Italian Journal of Ornithology. In the first two decades of the twentieth century Ghigi, Erminio Sipari and Pietro Romualdo Pirotta championed the cause of a national park in the Abruzzo Appnenines, and they succeeded in causing the creation of the National Park of Abruzzo, established as a private initiative and inaugurated on 9 September 1922 before obtaining government recognition. In 1933 he founded the Zoology Laboratory, then geared towards hunting, now called the National Institute for Wildlife. In 1938 Ghigi's name appeared among Italian scientists and intellectuals supporting the Fascist racial laws. In 1939 he published a volume on Biological Problems of race and miscegenation that argued \\"the superiority of our race\\" and accused mestizos of being \\"the cause of decline and disintegration, a wound in natural evolution.\\" He was elected a deputy of the Kingdom of Italy in the XXIV legislature, and on 6 February 1943 he was appointed senator. In 1951 Ghigi promoted establishment of the Commission for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources of the National Research Council, presiding over this committee until his death.

He hired two Swedish immigrant stonemasons to help construct it.Jiusto, Brown, and Ferris, p. 167. William Bruce, a Canadian immigrant, was hired as the construction foreman. He spent more than $10,000 on the structure, which was considered an extremely lavish amount at the time. The single-piece stone arches for the barn were imported from St. Louis, Missouri,Skornogoski, Kim. \\"A Barn Praising: Historic Structures Tell Tale of Montana's Rural Roots.\\" Great Falls Tribune. February 18, 2007. and shipped by steamboat to nearby Fort Benton. When completed after nearly three years, the nearby Sun River Press newspaper called it the \\"Marvel of Montana.\\" To celebrate the barn's completion, Adams held a roller skating party on the barn's second floor. The main section of the barn was used by Adams to house cattle. The west wing contained several horse stalls, and was also used to house the horse tack. The east wing was used as a garage for storing wagons, and contained a cooled room for holding dressed meat. The second floor was used to store hay. But dances were also held there, and it sometimes functioned as housing for passengers on the local stagecoach route.Ecke, Richard. \\"Commissioners Vote to Help Pay For Roof of Adams Stone Barn.\\" Great Falls Tribune. July 9, 2008. Two of Adams' workers, Robert Swain and Samuel Gilmour, founded Gilmour and Swain's Buggy and Carriage Repair and Corrective Shoeing in the barn in 1885. (The business still existed as of 2012 as Swains Spring Service.)Johnson, Peter. \\"Swains Spring Repair: From Buggies to RVs.\\" Great Falls Tribune. November 11, 2012. Fort Shaw closed in 1890. But until then, the fort's soldiers often held roller skating parties as well as formal functions in the barn's second floor. The barn's large meat locker also often stored meat for the fort. =20th century ownership changes= Adams died in 1913. His widow, who had nine children to support, was unable to pay the taxes on the farm. Fred A. Woehner, owner of the Great Falls Drug Co. (a small chain of pharmacies in the area), acquired the ranch in a tax sale in 1920 and used it as a home. Woehner died, and in 1939 C.A. Christensen (whose family owned a ranch next to the Adams property) purchased the ranch from his estate. The Christensen family used the barn to house cattle for their dairy. The Christensen family sold the ranch to Great Falls lumber yard and hardware store owner Harold Poulsen in 1973.Wilmot, Paula. \\"Historical Area Barn Goes on Auction Block.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 24, 2004. The same year that Poulsen bought the old Adams ranch and its stone barn, Mike and Teresa Stuckslager began researching the history of the barn. Mike Stuckslager was a former graphic and advertising design artist for the Chicago Tribune newspaper who quit to be the editor of two historic gun-collecting magazines. Teresa Stuckslager was a writer of commercials for radio and television. The Stuckslagers moved to Montana in early 1973, and quickly discovered the Adams Stone Barn. Over the next six years, the Stuckslagers researched the history of the barn, documented the genealogy of the Adams family, and established the historic nature of the structure. By 1979, the stone barn was in poor condition. The sandstone front wall was leaning forward by about , most of the windows lacked glass, and the life-size horse weathervane had lost its ears and tail to lightning. The roof was collapsing, most of the shingles were gone, and the ventilators had collapsed. The local newspaper, the Great Falls Tribune, said the structure was close to \\"near-certain collapse\\". Stuckslager nominated the barn for placement on the National Register of Historic Places, to which it was added in 1979. The Stuckslagers approached Poulsen about restoration efforts. Poulsen agreed the barn needed conserving, and that same year established a nonprofit organization, the Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co., to take ownership of the barn and the immediate land it stood on. (The nonprofit was named after a town that J.C. Adams planned to found near his ranch, but never did.) Poulsen received a $79,000 tax credit for donating the barn to the nonprofit. =Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. and the restoration of the barn= Ownership of the Adams Stone Barn by Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. made the structure eligible for preservation grants from the United States Department of the Interior. The nonprofit received a $79,000 preservation grant in 1980 that greatly improved its structural integrity. The roof was restored, new glass windows installed, and the second floor reinforced to prevent its collapse. The front sandstone wall was set upright, and all the walls strengthened against collapse. Much of the preservation work was performed by local volunteers. Another $31,000 was raised locally to finish the restoration work in 1981. The rededication of the Adams Stone Barn in August 1981 was attended by Montana Governor Ted Schwinden and Alma Adams Morgan, the 101-year-old surviving child of J.C. Adams. At some point between 1981 and 2002, Stuckslager installed an underground electrical power line that allowed the barn to have electric lighting and power. But no electric wiring inside the barn was installed, and the power never turned on.Ecke, Richard. \\"Historic Structure in Process of Getting Makeover.\\" Great Falls Tribune. May 17, 2008. =Sun River Valley Historical Society ownership= In 2004, the board of directors of the Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. voted to dissolve and sell the Adams Stone Barn. Teresa Osborne Stuckslager died in October 1994, and Mike Stuckslager married Jennifer Elaine Bobo in 1996. Mike Stuckslager died of heart disease in May 2003.\\"Stuckslager, Thomas Michael.\\" Chicago Tribune. May 14, 2003. Accessed 2013-01-15. Jennifer Stuckslager later remarried and had two children. Jennifer Stuckslager Stetson and her parents, Thomas and Melinda Bobo, served as the sole board members for the Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. But with a young family, Stetson no longer could devote the time needed to maintain the foundation. The Adams Stone Barn was put up for sale after the nonprofit received no \\"serious offers\\" from private individuals to buy it,\\"Proposed Sale of Historic Barn Raises Concern.\\" Associated Press. September 23, 2004. Accessed 2013-01-15. with a price of $150,000 to $300,000. Three of the four houses adjacent to the stone barn were also listed for sale, although not part of the stone barn property. She said any proceeds from the barn's sale would be donated to charity, although Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co.was still determining whether any grants had to be repaid. The sale was put on hold, however, after the Montana State Attorney General's office information Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. that a nonprofit could not sell its assets but had to transfer them to another nonprofit.Wilmot, Paula. \\"Adams Barn to Change Hands.\\" Great Falls Tribune. May 6, 2005. In May 2005, the press reported that another local nonprofit, the Sun River Valley Historical Society had signed a letter of intent to receive title to the Adams Stone Barn as a gift from the Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. At the time of the 2005 ownership transfer, the structure needed additional renovation. Many of the wooden window frames were rotting, the roof needed repairing, the building had been vandalized, and the structure was suffering from extremes of heat and cold (since it lacked heating).Ecke, Richard. \\"A Sun River Barn Raising.\\" Great Falls Tribune. November 5, 2007. Additionally, the building had little land around it to prevent encroachment. Although the building had a right-of- way from the local dirt access road to the front entrance, it lacked easements on the other three sides of the structure. By February 2007, the Sun River Valley Historical Society had reorganized the Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. Warren Harding of the Sun River Valley Historical Society was named the acting chairman of the board, and a new board was being formed. A for-profit unit, the J.C. Adams Stone Barn Co., was organized to promote the Adams Stone Barn as an event venue, with the goal of raising additional funds for the barn. In November 2007, the Montana Historic Preservation Office awarded a $10,000 grant to the reorganized Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. The grant was used for replacing broken windows, repairing rotting and damaged wooden window frames, and for emergency repairs to the roof. The nonprofit said that, despite the repairs, the building was quite structurally sound. The organization also began searching for ways to keep the building in use throughout the year, both to prevent vandalism and to raise money for the structure's continuing preservation. Among the ideas being considered were returning the structure to use as a horse stable, allowing a business to occupy a portion of the structure, turning the barn into a wedding venue, allowing a restaurant to operate in it, or using it as a museum. Further renovation occurred in May 2008. The reorganized Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. received a $10,000 preservation grant from the state and a $5,000 preservation grant from Cascade County as well as $6,000 in donations from local citizens which allowed the roof of the Adams Stone Barn to be replaced. Dick Olson Construction removed the old roof and replaced it with a new one at a cost of $24,500. Another $800 in electrical work permitted the power to be turned on inside the barn. Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. said it would engage in another fundraising effort to replace all the windows in the structure. The nonprofit said, however, that heating the barn was impractical. By July 2008, no use for the building had been determined. Dracut Junction Stone Barn Co. board members, however, said the ideal use would be agricultural. The nonprofit said in 2009 that the northeast corner of the structure was settling.\\"What's New.\\" J.C. Adams Stone Barn Co. No date. Accessed 2013-01-15.

About the barn Although the architect of the barn is not known, the style is primarily Romanesque Revival. It also exhibits design elements similar to those of barns raised by some of the wealthiest landowners and horse breeders in mid-1900s Kentucky. The barn is long and wide. It consists of a central building about long, with matching wings whose facades thrust slightly forward and back from the main building. The roof features gables and three ventilators, situated centrally over the main building and each wing. The central ventilator is roughly three times the height of the wing ventilators, and is topped by a lifesized iron-reinforced wooden horse weathervane. Romanesque arched doorways centrally pierce the main building and each wing. Double-doored hayloft access ports are located above each arched doorway. While most barns have only ladder access to the hayloft, the Adams Stone Barn features a formal staircase because it was intended to serve as much as a public meeting space as a storage area. The front facade is constructed of sandstone quarried from nearby sites and cut by hand on-site. The end walls are made of cement and rubble stone, while the rear wall is wood. The second floor is finished with long strips of hardwood. The roof was covered in hand- cut cedar shingles. By 2008, the original horse weathervane was too fragile to remain atop the Adams Stone Barn. It was removed and placed on display inside the barn, and a replica installed atop the central ventilator. In popular culture The J.C. Adams Stone Barn has been featured in several books about historic structures and historic barns. These include: *Big Sky Barns by Chuck Haney (2006). The book discusses 10 of the state's most important historic barns, including the Adams Stone Barn.Black, Jo Dee. \\"'Big Sky Barns' Reveals Ag's Evolution.\\" Great Falls Tribune.

C. Adams Stone Barn"},{"id":"38239427","text":"Elisa Pérez Rego, better known in music world simply as, Elisa Rego, is a singer, songwriter and radio host. She was born in São Paulo city, Brazil, on 21 May 1964. Since her youth she has been based in Caracas, Venezuela.  Her beginnings with ES-3  Elisa Rego started her career in music as a singer in various nightspots in Caracas. She was the lead singer in the underground rock group ES-3, a band composed of: Gerardo Ubieda on drums and electronic percussion, Jose Ignacio Martin (a.k.a.: Chuo) on keyboards, Enrique Moros on guitars, Rafael Figlioulo on bass and Elisa as lead vocalist. ES-3 was a band that became well known in Caracas' musical nights as they did covers of other singers songs, especially covers of songs by Mecano, the Spanish techno-pop group of the 80s. They were so well known for their covers of Mecano that when the Spanish trio visited Venezuela in 1986, the newspaper Últimas Noticias published an article that claimed that \\"ES-3 made Mecano famous\\" [sic], referring to the fact that the public was already familiar with the repertoire of the Spanish music group long before they set foot on Venezuelan soil. ES-3 disintegrated when Elisa began to make preparations to launch her solo singing career, but her first studio album featured some of the musicians from ES-3. The only song on this first solo album in which all the members of ES-3 were present was: \\"Noche De Fiesta\\" (\\"Night of Party\\"). It was some sort of a farewell song to ES-3.  Solo career = First album: Elisa Rego = Once separated from ES-3, Gerando Ubieda returned to his band \\"Témpano\\", a Venezuelan Prog-Rock band formed in the late 70s, and then becoming an alternative rock band in the late 1980s, and José Ignacio Martín became their keyboardist. In 1988, Elisa signs her first contract with the record label Sonografica with which she records her first studio album, simply titled: Elisa Rego for the characteristics of how it is structured, we can consider it as a mini-album as it only consists of eight songs, unusual thing for the time recording productions, where the LP usually featuring at least ten music themes. The musical style of the first album can be framed within the techno- rock trend. As the first promotional single on radio extracted the song titled \\"Libre de ti\\" (\\"Free from You\\"), a song with very good results at the level of public acceptance by the juvenile and contemporary adult target. Following this first hit and after a while they released the second promotional theme, the song titled \\"Blanco Y Negro\\" (\\"White and Black\\"), a song that is a classic in the repertoire of the singer, was also the first song she is chosen as the ending theme in some television programs. The third single to be taken from this first album becomes a song entitled \\"Selva\\" (\\"Forest\\") which is a techno- ballad with a very nice slow and cadenced rhythm with interesting surreal lyrics. It is worth mentioning that \\"Selva\\" was second of two issues of Elisa Rego used as the ending-theme in the soap opera Abigail starring Catherine Fullop and Fernando Carrillo. This song occupied the top positions in the Record Report helping to consolidate her seat of favoritism within radio- listening public taste. The fourth and final single for the radio promotion extracted was \\"Como tú\\" (\\"Like You\\") a minimalist ballad instrumentally speaking, which had some shooting on the radio, but not with the strength of the first two singles. In 1989, thanks to the sales success of this first album, Elisa Rego is worthy of several music awards including: * Ronda Awards, so Artist of the Year by journalists and music critics. * National Prestige Awards, awarded by the Venezuelan Business Association. In 1990 Elisa performs concert tours around the country and performs in musical programs in countries such as Puerto Rico, Bolivia, Panama and Colombia, consolidating his international career. = Vale La Pena = In 1991 she signed a contract with EMI-Venezuela and recorded her second studio album entitled \\"Vale La Pena\\" album that... might say, it is far removed from that presented in musical style from her first album. This second album had a sounds and atmospheres much more latino, especially in percussion. The songs remain despite the genre pop songs, they sound much more to salsa music and merengue music. The album contains 10 original songs of which only 3 are ballad-pop strictly speaking, rest of songs are from middle-tempo and up-tempo with a clear latino flavor. The album last-trackdisc, \\"No Le Hables, No Le Llores\\" (Don't talk to him, don't cry to him) is a song that makes eyes winks to the ballenato-merengue rhythms, although it is neither one nor the other. As the first promotional single extracted of album was song \\"Mamá No Me Deja\\" (Mom don't let me) theme that quickly positioned very well on the radio. Other song also sounded in radio is \\"Ésta Vez\\" (This Time) a song that is between being a ballad and mid- time, very latino song. There is also the theme, \\"Tratando\\" (Trying of) which the it made its respective videoclip. And unofficially, as usual, some broadcasters in radio, they placed on their own, two ballads on the disc are: \\"Me Pierdo En Tus Ojos\\" (I get lost in Your Eyes) and, \\"Por Haberme Olvidado (Te Perdono)\\" (For Having Forgotten Me [I forgive you]) the latter song, definitely one of the best songs of the whole album, with that typical pop- sound that characterized technological Elisa on her first album. It's one of her lesser-known albums and for many people, and this may be due to the \\"bad\\" choice of singles go when doing radio promotion. = De Amor Y Deseo = Come 1995, Elisa reenters studies recorded in this opportunity and what would become of her third album entitled: \\"De Amor Y Deseo\\" (Of Love and Desire) an album with a sound conceptual (whole album) much more pop and less reminiscent of latino-sound when it has to do with percussion sessions, ie, there are no songs that remind you first heard music-salsa, merengue-music; but must clarify that the pop that develop in this new album, not a local-style pop, something easily identifiable with a geographic area, it is the opposite, the songs that comprise this album have more international appearance and timeless... it feels that sound, that innate quality that is characteristic of a work that has been seen that better care (without underestimating previous albums with this) is that it seems an album that was recorded in one of these great recording studios international as Abbey Road, for example. This disc is removed as first single theme: \\"Abismo Del Corazón\\" (Abyss of Heart) (its author, Frank Quintero) which manages to occupy the first place in the radio charts for 15 consecutive weeks. After this single follow hits of \\"Como A Mi\\" (Like to Me), \\"Quiero Estar Contigo\\" (I Wanna Be with You) a song that is a duet with singer Pedro Castillo (former singer of the group Aditus) and, \\"Se Derritió Mi Soledad\\" (It Melted My Loneliness) one of the best ballad songs there in all this work-music, song with interpretation strong by singer. One of the most interesting songs from the repertoire of this album—and strangely little-advertised on the radio—is the theme entitled \\"Lo Único Que Quiero\\" (The Only Thing I Want) a song that for the way it is interpreted by Elisa we reminiscent that style of Aretha Franklin in the force how she sings chorus and also very good combination amalgamated with the backing vocals with lead voice, the song has a very international sound. We should also mention that within the album, there are two covers of high quality: In the first, Elisa made a Spanish version of the item entitled \\"Everything I Own\\", a song originally performed by David Gate, renamed in this adaptation that Elisa did as \\"Cada Día Mucho Más\\" (Every day More Much) a version where the naked ear it feels the influence of reggae music. And the second cover, this time the song \\"Groovin'\\", original of UB-40 group, renamed in Spanish as \\"Vive, Siente\\" (Lives, Feels). This album also has 2 bonus tracks and they are these same songs sung in Spanish; but in English this time sung in the voice of Elisa Rego. = Temperamental = After a recess period of ten years from that she release of \\"De Amor Y Deseo\\" album, in 2005, Elisa publishes her fourth studio album titled \\"Temperamental\\" album with a sound conceptual latin-pop-fusion. At this album Elisa re-takes again one of the most popular songs of Spanish group Mecano, \\"Aire\\" (Air) and she makes ot this song, one electronic version. It should be mentioned that \\"Aire\\" is one of the themes Mecano has been special for Elisa Rego, because it was that song that she sang when the discographic label: Sonographic Records, Inc did to her the 'Talent Test' to see what it sounded like her voice into the Study. Another version found in this album is the song \\"Amándote\\" (Loving You) theme is originally played by Colina, a venezuelan singer of pop-reggae-fusion is one of his icon themes. Elisa re-taken one of her old hits included on the first album, techno-ballad \\"Selva\\" and re-recorded it again; but in a new version, less tech than original version and with a rock-acoustic-sound. She makes a version of a song by Venezuelan musician, Frank Quintero, the song \\"Baila Conmigo\\" (Dance with Me) and last but not least, Elisa added the album a song sung in English, \\"Only The Lonely\\" original group The Motels. The album cover is designed to imitating the cover of Vanidades magazine. = Rockola = After some recess time, Elisa goes back to the recording studios releases her fifth studio album titled simply \\"Rockola\\", an album where the conceptual-theme of the album revolves around re-interpretations of nostalgic songs of all times, songs of Latin American musical-bitter. It's an album where you can notice at first glance, the influences of soul music as well as rhythm & blues, i.e., that typical \\"Motown Sound\\", that had a marked influence between the decades of the 1950s and 1960s; but with musical arrangements very contemporary. This album can be said to be a mix between instrumentation of that time, while retaining the same time that latin-touch. As the first promotional single from the album was extracted the theme \\"Nuestro Juramento\\" (Our Oath) a song originally performed by Julio Jaramillo. Also found in the repertoire of this work- musical themes as: \\"La Gata Bajo La Lluvia\\" (The Cat Under Rain) by Rocio Durcal, \\"Cóncavo Y Convexo\\" (Concave and Convex) by Roberto Carlos, \\"Sabor A Nada??\\" (Flavor to Nothing) by Palito Ortega, \\"Sombras Nada Más\\" (Nothing More that Shadows) by Javier Solis, \\"Mañana Me Iré\\" (Tomorrow I'll Go Myself) by Los Angeles Negros, \\"Tú Sabes\\" (You Know) of Estelita del Llano between others. In the pre-production of this album, Elisa and her team it took almost two years of preparation... between the research and selection of themes to form part of the repertoire. The album was recorded entirely on analog tape with live musicians into the recording room and after that, the tape was edited digitally, trying as much as possible to preserve the original sound without adding additives of any kind The album was launched on 24 September 2009 in a showcase for the media in the Sala del Centro Cultural Corp Banca.

Hill censers first start appearing in tombs dating to the Western Han (202 BCE – 23 CE). Fashioned with a conical lid, the censers were designed to look like miniature mountains. The more elaborately crafted versions incorporate imagery of trees, wild animals, and humans among the rocky crags of the landscape. The scented smoked is vented through apertures in the lid, creating a scene reminiscent of clouds swirling around a mountain. The earliest vessels of this type were recovered from tombs of the imperial family, including Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE), half- brother of the famed Emperor Wu of Han (157 – 87 BCE). Some excavated vessels lack vents and are thus believed to be examples of mingqi, or \\"spirit objects.\\" These latter objects are often called \\"hill jars\\" by scholars. Because hill censers first appeared when beliefs in sacred mountains inhabited by immortals were gaining in popularity, it is commonly thought these objects were crafted to represent these fantastic locations. Most frequently, hill censers are claimed to be depictions of Mount Penglai, the isle of the immortals located off the eastern coast of China. Some vessels have a tray as part of the foot support, further suggesting the censer represented a mountain island arising from the sea. Some scholars believe hill censers functioned as visual supports for envisioning the mountainous abodes of the immortals. Medieval Chinese sources suggest the close association of hill censers with the imperial court, noting they were used as wedding gifts for princes. The famed master craftsman, Ding Huan, is credited with creating a \\"nine-storied\\" hill censer carved with fantastic creatures that could move automatically.

She illustrated twenty editions of children's books.  Early life  Nora Fry was born in Liverpool, the daughter of Canadian-born Ambrose Fry, an urban landlord and chemical manufacturer, and Lydia (Lily) Thompson, who was from the Shetland Isles. Nora's brother, architect Maxwell Fry, in his autobiography mentions their mother playing the piano and that she had painted. She had an older sister Muriel Fry, and two younger brothers, Edwin Maxwell Fry and Sydney Fry. Nora Lavrin studied arts with her sister Muriel at the Liverpool School of Art. She won a travelling scholarship in 1920 and spent a year in Paris attending the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. She also traveled in the provinces, particularly Semur-en-Auxois where she did drawings and watercolors. Lavrin began her career as an illustrator of children's books in 1926, with designs for The Little Grey Men of the Moor by Betty Timms for Harrap. In 1927 she illustrated two more books, both of which ran to several editions. Her illustration of Aesop’s Fables (1927 and 1934) ran to eight editions between 1927 and 1989. She also illustrated A Treasure of Tales for Little Folks (1927) which ran several versions in the 1930s. In September 1927 she entered the Engraving School of the Royal College of Art, RCA, in Kensington where she specialized in engraving and etching under Robert Austin. Lavrin left the RCA in July 1928 having achieved her Certificate in Etching. In July 1928 Nora Fry married Janko Lavrin. Her marriage to Lavrin, Professor of Slavonic Studies at Nottingham University College, introduced her to Slovenia and Yugoslavia, a region she memorialized with some of her dry point landscape sketches in Slovenia Summer (1928) and Yugoslav Scenes (1935). The couple had two children, John Lavrin, a painter, and David H. Lavrin, an immunologist. From 1935 to 1937 she joined the University College of Nottingham as an art teacher. In the 1920s and 1930s she exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer exhibition; Liverpool Autumn Exhibition, Nottingham Society of Artists and galleries in England and, later in 1961, in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. World War II Land Girls unloading Flax, 1943, (Art.IWM ART LD 3587) During World War II the Lavrins were living in London. Janko Lavrin worked for the BBC World Service and Nora taught at a number of the art schools, including the Hammersmith School of Art, that had remained open during the conflict. Nora was also spent time outside London recording the work done by the Women's Land Army and several of these pieces were purchased by the War Artists' Advisory Committee and are now held by the Imperial War Museum. Lavrin continued to illustrate books including Averil Demuth's Trudi and Hansel (1938) and Hilda Lewis's The Ship that Flew (1939, 1986). She also illustrated Elisabeth Kyle’s The Seven Sapphires (1944), Holly Hotel (1945), Mirror of Castle Doone (1947) and Lost Karin (1947). Later life After the War Lavrin illustrated books on Slovene literature such as Vladimir Levstik, An Adder’s Nest (1931, 1943), Ivan Cankar’s The Bailiff Yerney and his Rights (London 1946), and The Ward of Our Lady of Mercy (Slovenia 1976), and Matej Bor’s A Wanderer in the Atomic Age (1967 and 1970). She also illustrated translations of several English classics into Slovene such as Villete by Charlotte Brontë (Ljubljana 1965), The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Brontë, and The Return of the Native, Far from the Madding Crowd and The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy. Among her publications is a personal memoir of the relationship between D. H. Lawrence, Jessica Chambers, a friend of his youth portrayed in Sons and Lovers, and Frieda Weekley (née von Richthofen), his mistress and wife. It was published posthumously in 1987 as D. H. Lawrence. Nottingham Connections. In 1952 she published The Hop Dog (1952) in collaboration with Molly Thorp. The story was later adapted into a children’s film, Adventure in the Hopfields (1954). Lavrin's interest in ballet sets and costumes resulted in her designs for Love and Litigation, choreographed by Pino Mlakar for the Slovene National Dance Company in 1956. She left sketches of the Colonel de Basil's Ballet Russe when it toured England in the 1930s. Lavrin also created many portraits sketches from daily life on paper in the 1950s. Her landscape oil works and watercolor portraits of her children and family are mostly held in private collections. The Ashmolean Museum at Oxford has a collection of her original illustrations. She is also represented in the collection of the Maribor Art Gallery in Slovenia. Her dry points of Yugoslavia published in 1935, in which the landscape is expressed in volumes and the people are captured as in snap shots. The Yugoslavia dry points aimed at witnessing a country and its people and have a very important historical value as they captured a region that would change irreversibly after World War II.

It helped bolster the economies of Western North Carolina, West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky, Eastern Tennessee, Northern Georgia and Northern Alabama during the Great Depression and thereafter; its founding in 1928 by Dutch capital led the way for German, Swiss, and British investments in the American South,The Story of American Enka: When the Dutch chose the South http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1961/61-10/enka.html and it was one of the companies on the original Fortune 500 list.https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune 500_archive/snapshots/1956/2715.html Founding Enka plant outside of Asheville, North Carolina. Photo taken in 1940 The American Enka Company was established outside of Asheville, North Carolina, in late September 1928 by a Dutch firm, the (Netherlands Artificial Silk Company). The name is derived from the sound of N-K, the initial letters of the parent firm, spoken in Dutch.Page 3 of http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1961/61-10/enka.html The Netherlands' Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek was founded by Jacques Coenraad Hartogs shortly before World War I. By 1928, it had merged with several other Dutch and German firms, so that Business Week would subsequently describe it as a \\"giant international textile combine\\". Already in 1924, it looked toward expanding into the American marketplace. Simultaneously, it and other like manufacturers worldwide were experiencing difficulties with the manufacturing devices to make synthetic fibers because they easily and continually broke down. The Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek (ENKA) was a member of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce's heavy industry division whose president at the time was Rento Hofstede Crull, the Dutch electrical pioneer who already had founded several companies. Hartogs and Hofstede Crull had become friends over the years; and Hartogs turned to him about the problem with the spinning devices. By May 1925, Hofstede Crull already had formulated a solution for the problem – Driving Device For A Centrifugal Spinning Machine and filed for patents in the Netherlands on May 6, 1925, and in the United States on May 3, 1926; thereafter it became fully patented in the United States on March 31, 1931, by the United States Patent office, (Patent No: 1,798,312; inventor R.W.H.H. Crull; by his international law firm, Marks & Clerk-Electric motor-INT Spinpot Exploitatie MIJ NV) http://google.com/patents/US1798312; http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2089933.html. (Download PDF 1798312) Thereafter, one of Hofstede Crull's companies, De Vijf and the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek formed a joint venture, De Internationale Spinpot Exploitatie Maatschappij (ISEM)Jaap Tuik.

This solution in the mid twenties for the rayon manufacturing problem was the means for the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek to enter the American market with its subsidiary, the American Enka Company in 1928 and with its creation thereby simultaneously circumventing trade protectism (See AkzoNobel). Two years later, the American Enka Company would become a free standing one. With the death of Hofstede Crull in 1938, the ISEM was fully integrated with the AKU, the Algemene Kunstzijde Unie which had resulted when the German Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken merged with the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek in 1929. The Early Years Initially, the Dutch brought in technicians and workers from the Netherlands to supervise the creation of the physical plant and to train an American labor force the skills necessary for the manufacturing of rayon.Page 5 of http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1961/61-10/enka.html Their success was quickly evident for in two years time they were able to turn the plant over to the ones they had taught so that they could return to the Netherlands. The American Enka (ENKA), thereby became an American entity run by Americans with an American labor force. The Dutch retained 56 per cent of the company's stock. By 1933, the American Enka rayon plant had experienced expansion and had 2,500 workers who were working a 40-hour weekColbond History See: http://www.colbond.us/history.htm during a time when most areas in the United States were experiencing the throes of the Great Depression. The ENKA's manufacturing needs also created economic opportunities for other industries: Its huge coal needs were met by the mining companies of eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, and southwest Virginia. Caprolactam, wood pulp, sulfuric acid, caustic soda and carbon disulfide needed for rayon production came from eastern Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia. All of this positively impacted the business of the Southern Railway, now the Norfolk Southern, and the railroad industry generally, e.g., such as the need for specially built box cars to transport rayon nationwide.http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1961/61-10/enka.html In the latter part of the 1930s, the ENKA began to produce a high-tenacity rayon yarn for automobile tires. This led to shipments of it which required large-scale commercial production. The 1940s Only twelve years after its origin in 1928, the ENKA employed 3,000 workers. In 1943, a multi-million dollars expansion occurred so it could produce an even more high-tenacity yarn for the Allied war effort, to be used for parachutes. On February 18, 1945, President Roosevelt signed executive order 9523 to authorize the Secretary of War to operate plants and facilities of the American Enka Corporation near Enka, North Carolina.https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive- orders/1945-roosevelt.html#9523 Since its origin, it also experimented and produced other fibers for the textile industry. Construction for a second major plant began in 1944 and it was located in Lowland, Tennessee. The new rayon factory was fully operational by 1948.http://www.colbond.us/history.htm ; http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1961/61-10/enka.html; and http://toto.lib.unca.edu/findingaids/oralhistory/SHRC/ayers_j_wilson.html The American Enka and A Time When The Fabric Was Just As Important As The Designer, 1950s-1980s Back in the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950, the American Enka was known for its superior rayon for it was used by everyone from Maurice Rentner \\"a,b,c...\\" Life Magazine, May 8, 1944, Vol.16 No. 19, p.65 Maurice Rentner is referred to as the garment/haute couture industry's \\"little Napoleon\\" and this article references his chief designer Bill Blass who would eventually take over and rename the business after him. to L'Aiglon http://www.aiglonfr/Translate this page; also L'Aiglon/Vintage Fashion Guild:Label Resource: vintagefashionguild.org/label - resource/aiglon and mentioned in advertisements appearing in periodicals such as Harper's Bazaar and Vogue.

Magnin, etc.http://thevintagetraveler.wordpress.com/2009/03/01/american-enka-makers- of-rayon-and-n... In 1953, the ENKA broke ground for a new nylon plant in Enka, North Carolina. A year later the ENKA became the first U.S. producer of fine denier Nylon 6. This had been developed earlier and independently by ENKA's Dutch parent company, the AKU, which had transferred the know-how to this U.S. manufacturer. Like with its promotion of rayon, the ENKA relied on the same avenues to make the public aware of its superior nylon from the mid-1950s through the 1980s. SEE: Images for Enka Rayon The 1950s on: Research and Expansion Research had always been emphasized ever since the ENKA had been founded in the United States. In the mid-1950s, a separate research center was constructed and it was enlarged in the early 1960s. This led to broadening the development of synthetic fiber.Page 7 of http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1961/61-10/enka.html;also http://www.colbond.us/history.htm Already during the late thirties, the ENKA had begun a relationship with the textile research group at the National Bureau of Standards. When its director, Milton Harris,scientist started the Harris Research Laboratories after World War II, his relationship with the American Enka Company continued and expanded. Others associated with ENKA's research over the years would also be honored with major honors in the fields of chemistry, polymer chemistry and textiles. Ralph McGregor would be the last to be honored with his receipt of the Louis Atwell Olney Medal (Louis Olney).Ralph McGregor: http://www.textilehistory.org/RalphMcGregor.html ; Olney Medal Recipients: http://www.aatcc.org/awards/Olneypast.htm Attendant with this emphasis on research was the belief of having an educated work force. The American Enka supported a formal program of college education for its own work force in which its employees could participate in their spare time. A charitable trust had already been created in 1952 which provided such things as college scholarships.Page 7 of http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1961/61-10/enka.html The American Enka Company also provided the means for local people to achieve in the company and outside of it. Two examples are Claude Swanson Ramsey, Jr., who began his career in the ENKA's industrial relations department and would over time become president of the company;See: http://www.historync.org/laureate %20-%20Claude%Ramsey.htm. Ramsey also served as director/trustee of Wachovia, the Amstar Corporation, Rockefeller University, Bowman-Gray School of Medicine,the Asheville School, North Carolina State University, etc. and James E. Bostic, Jr., who would begin his career at the ENKA and go on to Washington, D.C., and then take on varied executive positions in the paper industry and serve on various boards as the first black director or trustee.http://secure.progress-energy.com/aboutus/news/article.asp?id=3422; boards such as Progress Energy, Wachovia, Clemson University, Tuskegee University, Wofford College, The Westminster Schools, National Parks Conservation Association, etc. In the mid-1950s, the American Enka moved its headquarters from New York's Madison Avenue to the site of its Asheville campus. Expansion plans of it were announced in 1969 and the facility opened in 1970. By that time, the American Enka Company had ten plants around the country and about 11,000 employees nationwide. Also, it was then that Akzona, Inc. was created to serve as a holding company for the American Enka, International Salt Company, and Organon Inc..http://www.colbond,us/history.htm Later, buildings were razed at Pack Square in downtown Asheville in 1979 so that the I. M. Pei designed Akzona headquarters could be built.Akzona Corporation Building http://www.heritagewnc.org/buildings/AKZONA_building.htm Later years, acquisition by BASF, and legacy The former Enka plant site in Lowland, Tennessee In the early 1980s, the American Enka began to restructure itself to remain competitive in the American marketplace because it was hard hit by imports from the Far East. Toward the end of 1985, the ENKA was purchased by the Badische Corporation; and its fibers operation combined with those of Badische's to form BASF Corporation Fibers Division.noted aforesaid is the role Rento Hofstede Crull played in the furtherance of the AKU, known today as AkzoNobel; ironically, archival information about one of the unions of the Dutch patriciergeslachten Van Reimsdijk and Crull (of which Hofstede Crull was a member) shows that an earlier Crull, a wealthy landowner and owner of several inns along the Dutch and what would become the German border, and his Van Reimsdijk brother-in-law owned a cloth dyeing business which along with several others along the banks of the Rhine River would join Friedrich Engelhorn's Badische Anilin-und-Soda Fabrik, that would become the basis for I.G. Farbenindustrie AG (I.G. Farben), and later in time BASF During the mid-1990s AkzoNobel purchased back a portion of the BASF operationAkzoNobel is what the original Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek evolved into today and it was named AkzoNobel Nonwovens. It began to produce a nonwoven named Colback which was/is used in carpet backing, automotive and industrial applications and Geosynthetics Products used in the building and environmental markets. After AkzoNobel's acquisition of Britain's Courtaulds Fibers in 1998, a new company was formed in 2000 that combined Courtaulds Fibers and AkzoNobel Nonwovens to successively become Colbond. Actually AkzoNobel divested all of its fibers division in 2000 to form a new company called Acordia based in Spondon, England, but its management was still located in Arnhem, Netherlands, home of AkzoNobel.AkzoNobel is now headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands Today what began as the ENKA in Asheville, North Carolina, and the part that became Colbond with its overseas plants are now divisions of London, England-based Low & Bonar. Colbond, Inc., in Asheville is the only Low & Bonar holding in the United States. Plans were announced in 2008 to expand its Asheville Geosynthetics department. Some of the ENKA's manufacturing operations in the United States became part of Union Carbide, a Dow chemical subsidiary. Whatever ENKA manufacturing operations BASF still had in Asheville had been phased out in 2008 and moved to other manufacturing sites.http://www.basf.us/corporate/news2005/032305_enka.htm ReferencesExternal links Category:Textile companies of the United States Category:1928 establishments in the United States ","title":"American Enka Company"},{"id":"38239762","text":"Lucas Arnold and Mariano Hood were the defending champions, but lost in the semifinals this year.

He published about 40 volumes of never before seen Rishonim.  Early life  Rabbi Blau was born in Hamburg, Germany on October 15, 1912 (4th of Cheshvan 5673) to his parents Dr. Yirmiyahu Armin Hakohen and Leah Blau. At the age of 19 he went to study at the Mir Yeshiva, in Poland, under the tutelage of the Mashgiach, Rav Yeruchom Levovitz. He fell ill while in the Yeshiva and went to great lengths to receive the blessing of the Chofetz Chaim. With the outbreak of World War II, he fled together with the Yeshiva to Lithuania, received a visa from Chiune Sugihara enabling him and his wife to flee to Japan, and finally Shanghai, China, surviving the Holocaust. After the war was over he settled in the United States where he eventually became a chassid of the Lubavitcher Rebbe.  Publishing Rishonim  In the United States he started corresponding with various library's, institutions, universities and museums to examine their holdings looking for unpublished ancient manuscripts of the Rishonim. He was successful in accessing the recesses of the Vatican Library. He ordered copies or microfilms of the manuscripts, which he would analyze and try to determine who authored it, as many of them were anonymous. To accomplish this, a near-surgical search of every possible commentary of relevance was required, in the hope of finding an attributed quote drawn from the anonymous work. Sometimes it involved catching a certain style, choice of words, or recurring phrase, that was found in an already existing commentary that attributed those words to a specific rabbi. He succeeded in identifying tens of Reshonim left untouched for hundreds of years. Once found he singlehandedly published these commentaries with his own notes. The first and one of the most famous books he published was the Commentary of the Ritva on Bava Batra. Many of his books were titled \\"*as Hakadmonim\\" (Commentary of the early ones). Rabbi Blau served as the spiritual leader of the Ahavas Achim synagogue in East New York, Brooklyn for 20 years, and then of congregation Avrohom U'tzvi Hirsch in Borough Park, Brooklyn for 30 years. Rabbi Blau actively campaigned for the upkeep of the Mitzvos of Tefillin and Mezuzos. He would write and lecture about Kosher Tefillin and Mezuzos and that small Mezuzos were very often not Kosher. He arranged for roving Sofrim to travel to small cities in the United States and Canada to check Tefillin and Mezuzos free of charge and provided subsidized Tefillin and Mezuzos for those who did not have Kosher ones, or did not have them at all.

The deck used was recorded by Lu Rong in the 15th century and the rules later by Pan Zhiheng and Feng Menglong during the early 17th century.Lo, Andrew (2004), \\"China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong\\". In: Mackenzie, C. and Finkel, I., (eds.), Asian Games: The Art of Contest. New York: Asia Society, pp. 216-231. Korean poet Jang Hon (1759-1828) wrote that the game dates back to the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). It continued to be popular during the Qing dynasty until around the mid-19th century. The game was also known in Japan from at least 1791.Morishima Chūryō. (1800) Keirin Manroku (桂林漫録). Edo (Tokyo). It is played with 40 cards and four players. In Chinese, mǎ (马) means \\"horse\\" and diao (吊) means \\"hanged\\" or \\"lifted.\\" The name of the game comes from the fact that three players team against the banker, like a horse raising one shoe (banker), with the other three remaining hooves on the ground (three players). Description A set of madiao consists of 40 cards of four suits: *Cash or coins (纹, wen): 11 cards, from 1 to 9, half cash, and zero cash. This suit is in reverse order with zero cash as the highest while 9 cash is the lowest. This is a feature found in many of the oldest known games including ganjifa, tarot, ombre, maw, and tổ tôm. The half cash and zero cash did not exist in Lu Rong's account. *Strings of coins (索瘠, suǒ jí): 9 cards, from 1 to 9 strings. *Myriads of strings (万 or 萬, wàn): 9 cards, from 1 to 9 myriad. *Tens of myriads (十, shí): 11 cards, from 20 myriad to 90 myriad, and of hundred myriad, thousand myriad, and myriad myriad. The latter two cards were dropped from the deck by the end of the 19th century. There is no card of 10 myriad as it would share the same name as its suit. Each card of myriads or tens (of myriads) along with the zero cash was illustrated with one of the 108 Stars of Destiny of the Chinese novel the Water Margin attributed to Shi Nai'an. The characters depicted on these cards can vary depending on the region or manufacturer. Usually they play no role in games, however in Feng's version they do. In the suits of cash and strings, the pips were copied from banknotes such as the jiaozi and jiaochao. Unlike the other cards, the half cash displays a sprig of flowers. Ten cards contain red stamps mimicking banknote seals are known as red cards which carry bonuses: Myriad Myriad, Thousand Myriad, Hundred Myriad, 20 Myriad, 9 Myriad, 1 Myriad, 9 Strings, 1 String, Zero Cash, and 9 Cash. Game=Rules of the game=Dealing Seating and the banker is decided through drawing the highest card, or by dice. The banker decides what the stakes are for the hand (it should be an even number so it can be split and within the margins agreed by consensus). The player to the banker's left shuffles then passes the deck to the banker's right who becomes the dealer. The dealer cuts and reveals a card. If the card is a 4 or 8, he or she deals first to themselves. If it's a 3 or 7, the banker is dealt first. If it's a 2 or 6, the shuffler is dealt first. If it's a 1, 5, 9, Zero Cash, Half Cash, Hundred Myriad, Thousand Myriad, or Myriad Myriad, the banker's opposite gets dealt first. Each player is dealt 8 cards counter-clockwise, first as a batch of four cards then singles. The remaining eight cards form the stock which is flipped to reveal the bottom card. Declarations A player that has at least five cards from any suit can force a redeal. If a player has the four lowest cards of each suit (20 Myriad, 1 Myriad, 1 String, 9 Cash), he will automatically win 1 stake each from the other 3 players and cards are dealt again. The banker is chosen again by picking the high card. A player with any of the following melds automatically wins and will become the next banker. Everyone except the player holding the Hundred Myriad has to pay for the following: *Myriad Myriad, 9 Myriad, 9 Strings, Zero Cash: 4 stakes *Myriad Myriad, Hundred Myriad, 9 Myriad, 9 Strings, Zero Cash: 5 stakes *Flush: 4 stakes *Flush of Tens with the Hundred Myriad: 5 stakes *Eight reds: 6 stakes *Eight reds containing Hundred Myriad: 7 stakes *Myriad Myriad, 20 Myriad, 9 Myriad, 1 Myriad, 9 Strings, 1 String, Zero Cash, 9 Cash: 8 stakes Play The first person who was dealt leads. In a counter-clockwise rotation, each player then tries to take tricks; following suit is not required but only the highest card of the suit played wins. Players can also discard (slough) their card face down if they can't or won't win the trick (this is similar to Tien Gow, Tam cúc, Six Tigers, Ganjifa, Kaiserspiel, and Brazilian Truco). Discarding face up is penalized with paying two stakes. Each player tries to win at least two tricks to avoid paying the banker. If the banker loses, then he'll have to pay the winners. Anyone who has not won one of the first seven tricks will automatically lose the last trick regardless of the strength of their final card. It is a strategy game requiring the cooperation of players against the banker. The Hundred Myriad is an important card to protect or capture as it figures in many bonuses. Payment After all eight tricks have been played, the revealed card from the stock is removed to expose the card under it. If this card is the highest card of its suit, the one who played the second highest has to pay the other three 1 stake each unless it was sloughed face down. A player who wins a trick with the Hundred Myriad and makes exactly two tricks get 1 stake from the other two players and 3 stakes from the banker. If the banker does this, he wins 3 stakes from each player and will remain the banker for the next hand. The following are payments between the banker and the other players: *Winning a trick with the highest card of a suit (if the first upcard of the stock is the highest, the second highest of the same suit takes its place): 1 stake (Only those that reached the minimum of two tricks are eligible to receive this bonus.) *Failing to reach the minimum with the Hundred Myriad: 1 stake (Consolation for simply being dealt the Hundred Myriad.) *Winning at least three tricks: 1 stake *Making minimum but losing the Hundred Myriad: 2 stakes *Winning with the Myriad Myriad, Thousand Myriad, and Hundred Myriad: 3 stakes *Winning with the Myriad Myriad, Thousand Myriad, Hundred Myriad, and Zero Cash: 4 stakes *Slam (winning all eight tricks): 8 stakes Player to the right becomes the next banker with special exceptions mentioned above. Play ends after everyone has had a chance to be the banker. =Evolution of the rules= During the Qing dynasty, the rules of the game became ever more complex with some variants having hundreds of rules. More bonuses could be melded and the discarded cards in the stock could be used. The Kangxi Emperor (1661-1722) banned the manufacturing and sale of cards in 1691. However, the game continued to remain popular and was played by government officials as well as members of the imperial family. During the late Ming dynasty, new card games often dropped the suit of tens but kept the Thousand Myriad for a total of 30 cards like Khanhoo. During the Qing dynasty, the popularity of three-suited games led to the printing of stripped decks. Some draw-and-discard games combined multiple decks of three-suited cards leading to the birth of Mahjong in the mid-19th century.

Born in Paphlagonia, Philaretos was very rich and belonged to an illustrious local aristocratic family of Byzantine Anatolian magnates. According to the hagiography written by his grandson Niketas, Philaretos possessed unworldly generosity and gave away most of his wealth. It depicts Philaretos as a fool for Christ. The hagiography is also noteworthy for those studying the period. The lands of Paphlagonia, for example, are described as having been raided by the \\"Ishmaelites\\", attesting to the success of Islamic raids into Byzantine territory, as Paphlagonia is within a few days' ride of Constantinople. Furthermore, the work reveals the possible political undertones of Philaretos's canonization. Becoming a saint at the time required substantial investments, including a cult, churches built throughout imperial territory and a sustained endowment to continually petition the Church and Bishop synods to grant sainthood. Some historians have suggested that Niketas wrote the hagiography in order to legitimize the family and increase its prestige. Maria of Amnia, Philaretos's granddaughter, had married Emperor Constantine VI of the Byzantine Empire largely at the insistence of his powerful mother Empress Irene in the first recorded bride-show. The bride-show might have been an attempt by Irene to marry her son to a girl with no substantial connections and thus to reduce his power. Empress Irene relentlessly maintained her power even as her son matured and the regency ended. In fact, the hagiography by Niketas refers to the Empress Irene as \\"Basileus\\" Irene, using the masculine form of the Greek word meaning 'emperor' to indicate her powerful role. After Constantine VI succeeded in wresting power from his mother, he also divorced Maria. Thus, the work of Niketas might be seen as an attempt to shore up the family's ancestry with a holy and respected figure in order to confer prestige and legitimacy in the aftermath of the divorce.

The second tropical storm and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, it formed from an area of disturbed weather on September 16, 1920, northwest of Colombia. The system remained a weak tropical depression as it made landfall on Nicaragua, but later intensified to tropical storm strength as it moved across the Gulf of Honduras, prior to making a second landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the storm quickly intensified as it moved towards the north-northwest, reaching its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) prior to making landfall near Houma, Louisiana with no change in intensity. Afterwards, it quickly weakened over land, before dissipating on September 23 over eastern Kansas. As it approached the United States Gulf Coast, the hurricane forced an estimated 4,500 people to evacuate off of Galveston Island, and numerous other evacuations and precautionary measures to occur. At landfall, the hurricane generated strong winds along a wide swath of the coast, uprooting trees and causing damage to homes and other infrastructure. Heavy rainfall associated with the storm peaked at in Robertsdale, Alabama. The heavy rains also washed out railroads, leading to several rail accidents. Across the Gulf Coast, damage from the storm totaled to $1.45 million, and one death was associated with the hurricane. Meteorological history In mid-September, a trough moved across the central Caribbean Sea and into the vicinity of the Colombian islands. Becoming more organized, it developed a closed circulation on September 16, and as such was classified as a tropical depression at 0600 UTC that day. For much of its early existence the depression remained weak, with winds remaining at and a minimum barometric pressure below . The weak disturbance later made landfall at that intensity on the Mosquito Coast near the border of Honduras and Nicaragua by 0600 UTC on September 18\\\\. The small system gained intensity as it moved over Honduras, attaining tropical storm strength on September 19 prior to entering the Gulf of Honduras near Trujillo. In the Gulf of Honduras, the tropical storm slightly intensified to maximum sustained winds of on September 20, and later made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula as it accelerated towards the north-northwest. Despite initially being reported to have maintained intensity across the peninsula, a reanalysis of the storm determined that it had weakened to minimal tropical storm strength, before entering the Gulf of Mexico late on September 20. The weakened tropical storm began to intensify once in the Gulf of Mexico. On September 20 at 0600 UTC, the storm reached hurricane intensity as a modern-day Category 1 hurricane. Continuing to intensify in the Gulf, the hurricane attained Category 2 hurricane intensity at 0000 UTC on September 22, and subsequently reached its peak intensity with winds of and an estimated minimum pressure of . The hurricane later made landfall at peak intensity near Houma, Louisiana at 0100 UTC later that day. Maximum winds spanned from the center at landfall. Ships offshore the Louisiana coast also reported an eye associated with the hurricane. Once over land, the system began to quickly weaken, degenerating to tropical storm strength by 0600 UTC the same day, while located near Iberville Parish. Continuing to accelerate towards the north-northwest, it is estimated that the tropical cyclone dissipated on September 23 over Kansas, based on observations from nearby weather stations. Preparations and impact alt=Black and white contoured map showing rainfall amounts. Hurricane warnings were initially issued for areas of the Gulf Coast between Morgan City, Louisiana and Corpus Christi, Texas, but were later moved eastward to coastal regions between Pensacola, Florida and New Orleans as the hurricane progressed closer to the coast. Additional marine warnings were also issued for offshore regions that could be potentially affected by the hurricane, and boats were evacuated into Gulf Coast ports. Onshore, freight trains on Galveston Island were moved to the mainland in preparation for the storm. Interurban railways also evacuated people out of the island, with an estimated 4,500 people being evacuated. The United States Coast Guard were ordered to be ready for immediate service in the event of an emergency, while the US National Guard on strike duty in Galveston's Camp Hutchings were transferred to a barracks in Fort Crockett. Oil companies abandoned operations in coastal oil fields in advance of the hurricane. People along Lake Ponchartrain evacuated into New Orleans, causing hotels to overflow and forcing refugees to take shelter in other public buildings including post offices. Strong winds and gusts were reported across the Gulf Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. A ship reported a minimum central barometric pressure of just prior to the storm's intensification into a hurricane. Grand Isle, Louisiana reported sustained winds of , and winds of at least were reported as far east as Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. As a result, numerous trees were uprooted and power lines were downed. One death occurred New Orleans after being electrocuted by an electric wire that had been downed by the hurricane's strong winds. The downed power lines also caused a lack of communication from areas affected, hampering relief efforts. In New Orleans, at least 2,500 telephones were without service, and homes were unroofed by the strong winds. Along the coast and further inland, rainfall was concentrated primarily on the eastern half of the cyclone, with most rain occurring from September 21 to the 23rd. In Robertsdale, Alabama, of rain was recorded, the most associated with the hurricane. A 24–hour September rainfall record was set when of rain was measured in Kelly, Louisiana. However, due to the system's rapid dissipation over land, rainfall amounts remained generally less than in interior regions of Louisiana. In Texas, rainfall peaked at in Beaumont. The heavy rains caused washouts and damage to railroads across Louisiana. A train running from Louisville, Kentucky to Nashville, Tennessee was left stranded after being washed out near Chef Menteur Pass, and other rail operations were stopped between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama. Tides of above average were reported in Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound as the hurricane moved over the coast, while tides of above average were reported in Biloxi, Mississippi. The strong storm surge caused considerable damage to Grand Isle and Manilla Village, Louisiana. Due to the hurricane's landfall near low tide, however, major storm surge impacts were mitigated. Overall infrastructural damage caused by the hurricane totaled to $750,000, while crop related damage, particularly to rice and sugar cane, totaled to $700,000.

He has been considered the prototypical example of what is called a cultural Christian (), meaning a believer who may lack a specific church identification or affiliation, and was, along with He Guanghu, one of the main forerunners of the academic field of Sino-Christian Theology (). However, in recent years, his interest has shifted from studies in Christian theology to the political theories of Leo Strauss.  Biography  Liu Xiaofeng was born in Chongqing, China, in April 1956. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in German language and literature at Sichuan International Studies University before beginning his Master of Arts in aesthetics at Peking University in 1982, completing it in 1985. He later received a scholarship to study at the University of Basel in Switzerland in April 1989, where he completed his Ph.D in Christian theology in 1993 on a theological investigation into Max Scheler's phenomenology and critique of modernity.Fällman, Salvation and Modernity, 32. He also undertook an extensive translation effort of historical and contemporary Christian texts. A modern writer commented, \\"Liu's writings have had a major impact in China not only on those Chinese who think of themselves as Christian, but on those who are interested in broad analysis of China in the context of the world's current cultural and philosophical era.\\" However, his interpretation of Strauss and other modern Western thinkers has been criticized as one-sided and even deeply flawed, with critics claiming that his defense of the Chinese Communist Party, and Mao Zedong in particular, does not go well together with Christianity, nor with Classical Western civilization as described by Strauss and his disciples . He is a faculty member of Renmin University of China in the School of Liberal Arts.  Writings  * Liu, Xiaofeng (2015).

He served in senior roles under Prime Ministers Menzies, Holt, McEwen, Gorton, McMahon, Whitlam, Fraser and Hawke, and ended his career as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. Career Peter Lawler was born on 23 March 1921. He was educated at St Joseph's College Hunters Hill, St Stanislaus College, Bathurst, and the University of Sydney, graduating in economics. He joined the Department of Postwar Reconstruction in 1944, then the Prime Minister's Department in 1950. In 1951, along with Kenneth Herde, he was seconded to the UK Cabinet Office in London to do research on the workings of government, with a view to bringing back ideas that could be applied within the Australian context. He remained there until 1953, and also undertook postgraduate training in several European cities. Lawler's and Herde's recommendations led to Robert Menzies' decision to establish a Cabinet Office in Canberra as a separate and discrete part of the Prime Minister's Department. He became a Deputy Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department in 1964. He wrote the 1966 Cabinet decision that led to the abolition of the White Australia policy. In October 1967, as Acting Secretary, he was involved in the VIP aircraft affair that threatened the premiership of Menzies' successor Harold Holt, but used his experience and shrewdness to protect himself and escape the odium that was visited on Sir John Bunting. In 1968, Prime Minister John Gorton made the Cabinet Office a department in its own right (generally believed to be his way of sidelining Sir John Bunting), and Lawler joined it as Deputy Secretary to Bunting, remaining there until March 1971 when the new prime minister William McMahon merged it with the Prime Minister's Department to create the new Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. From 1972 to 1975 Peter Lawler was Secretary of the Department of the Special Minister of State, serving the Whitlam Government, then Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services from 1975 to 1983, serving the Fraser Government. After Sir Robert Mark's report on the organisation of protective services in the wake of the February 1978 Sydney Hilton bombing, the Fraser Government set up a small taskforce, headed by Peter Lawler, to implement the recommended creation of the Australian Federal Police. In March 1983 the incoming Hawke Government appointed Lawler Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland and Ambassador to the Holy See, serving until his retirement in 1986. He was resident in Ireland, except for four months prior to Pope John Paul II's visit to Australia. Lawler lobbied to have the post of Ambassador to the Holy See permanently resident in Rome, but this did not occur until Tim Fischer's appointment in 2008. He was a Member of the Council of the Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences for many years. Lawler died on 1 April 2017, aged 96, survived by his seven surviving children from two marriages, and their offspring. Personal life Lawler was a Catholic with open Australian Labor Party affiliations. He became a patron of the Australian Family Association in 2008. He and his wife were named Australian Family of the Year by the Association. He is also a Cooperator of the Prelature of the Holy Cross & Opus Dei. He married Mary Thornton in 1944. She gave him six children, but both mother and son Gerard died at his birth in 1957. In 1958 he married Mary Robinson, and two more children followed. Lawler's family home was destroyed in the 2003 Canberra bushfires.

The law was passed by the New York State Legislature and was signed into law by Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo in January 2013. The legislation was written in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and the December 24 Webster, New York, shooting. Cuomo described the law as the toughest gun control law in the United States. The NY SAFE Act contains a number of firearms regulations. It also contains a severability provision that allows other measures to remain in place in case the broad prohibitions against weapons are invalidated by the courts. Legislative history The New York State Senate approved the act on a 43–18 vote on January 14, 2013.Thomas Kaplan, Sweeping Limits on Guns Become Law in New York, New York Times (January 15, 2013). The vote was bipartisan, with nine Senate Republicans voting in favor.Jimmy Vielkind, Senate set to vote on SAFE Act tweaks, Politico (July 8, 2015). State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein sponsored the legislation.Teri Weaver, NY senator pushes to ban gun sales, possession for those on U.S. terrorist watch lists, Syracuse.com (December 11, 2015). The following day (the second full day of the 2013 legislative session), the New York State Assembly approved the legislation by a 104–43 vote, and Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law less than one hour later. The passage of the law made New York the first to pass restrictions on gun laws since the Sandy Hook massacre. Cuomo described the law as the toughest gun control law in the United States. The bill passed under the \\"message of necessity\\" procedure, a device in the New York State Constitution by which the governor may expedite a vote on a bill, bypassing a usual three-day waiting period. Although nominally used for emergencies, the \\"message of necessity\\" procedure has been frequently used in New York to pass many pieces of legislation (it has been used at least 415 times since 1938).Michelle Breidenbach, The Safe Act \\"emergency\\": How Cuomo, past governors bypassed public to make laws, Syracuse.com (March 13, 2013). Provisions The NY SAFE Act includes the following provisions:New York passes major gun control law - first since Newtown massacre - NBCNews.com, January 15, 2013 * The Act broadened the legal definition of assault weapon to include those semi-automatic rifles, semi- automatic pistols (handguns), and semi-automatic shotguns with one or more \\"military-style features, such as a telescoping stock, bayonet mount, flash suppressor, grenade launcher and others.\\"Tom Precious, Appeals court upholds SAFE Act but rules against seven-bullet limit, Buffalo News (October 19, 2015).SAFE Act FAQ, Office of the Governor of New York. This \\"one-feature test\\" was a change from the previous \\"two-feature test,\\" enacted in New York in 2000, which barred such weapons if they had two or more of the enumerated features.James B. Jacobs & Zoe Fuhr, The SAFE Act: New York's Ban on Assault Weapons and Large Capacity Magazines Criminal Law Bulletin (forthcoming, 2017). The bill provided a \\"grandfathering\\" provision allowing those with an assault weapon (under the newer, broader definition), to keep the weapon, but required that it be registered with the New York State Police (with a thirteen-month period to register and a deadline of April 15, 2014). There is no fee to register. Alternatively, owners of such weapons could avoid registration by selling the weapon to a New York State dealer or to someone out-of-state by January 15, 2014, or by permanently removing the design characteristics that make the weapon an assault weapon under the Act. Under the Act, the registry of assault weapons is confidential and not subject to public disclosure. The constitutionality of the assault-weapon prohibition was upheld by Chief U.S. District Judge William M. Skretny in 2013,Thomas Kaplan, Federal Judge Upholds Majority of New York Gun Law, New York Times (December 31, 2013). and this ruling was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2015. * The Act included a high-capacity magazine provision that has been found unconstitutional.https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2015/10/19/new- york-safe-act-court-appeals-ruling/74224108/ According to that language, beginning on April 15, 2013, only magazines with a capacity of seven rounds could legally be sold in New York. The Act allowed the continued possession of ten-round magazines purchased before that date, but made it illegal to load more than seven rounds of ammunition into a ten-round magazine except \\"at an incorporated firing range or competition recognized by the National Rifle Association or International Handgun Metallic Silhouette Association.\\" Historic or antique guns (defined as those manufactured more than fifty years ago) were exempt from this requirement. The magazine provisions were struck down by Judge Skretny in 2013, and this ruling was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2015, allowing New York gun owners to \\"legally load 10 rounds in a 10-round magazine.\\" Neither the Act nor the subsequent court cases affected New York's pre-existing ten-round magazine limit. The Act did not place a limit on the number of magazines that an individual could purchase at any one time. * The Act contains language requiring ammunition dealers to conduct background checks (similar to those for gun buyers) for ammunition purchases, as well as a ban on direct Internet sales of ammunition.Thomas Kaplan, Plan to Require Background Checks for Ammunition Sales Is Suspended in New York, New York Times (July 10, 2015).Teri Weaver, Cuomo agrees to changes to NY Safe Act regarding ammunition sales, Syracuse.com (July 10, 2015). (Under the Act, online ammunition sales to New Yorkers remain legal, but online buyers are required to purchase ammunition through a licensed dealer in the state and obtain the ammunition in person).Questions whether Safe Act deal changes anything, Associated Press (July 13, 2015). As of August 2019, the provisions of the Act regarding ammunition background checks have never been implemented because a state database that would make such checks possible has not been created. In 2015, Governor Cuomo and Senate entered into an unusual \\"memorandum of understanding\\" suspending the ammunition background check provisions of the Act, citing a \\"lack of adequate technology.\\" The memo stated that the database \\"cannot be established and/or function in the manner originally intended at this time.\\" The memo did not formally amend the Act or have legal effect; according to the governor's office, however, it \\"provides assurances to all that the database will not be implemented until it is ready and tested.\\" * The Act amended the New York Mental Hygiene Law to add a new reporting requirement for mental health professionals (including physicians, psychologists, registered nurses and licensed clinical social workers).The SAFE Act: Guidelines for Complying With the New Mental Health Reporting Requirement, New York State Psychiatric Association. Under this provision, which went into effect on March 16, 2013, mental health professionals currently providing treatment services to an individual must make a report to authorities, \\"if they conclude, using reasonable professional judgment, that the individual is likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others.\\" The reports are sent first sent to county officials, and \\"if they agree with the assessments, the officials then input the names into the state database. The information is retained for five years. If the authorities find a person in the database has a gun permit—necessary to purchase a handgun in New York—they are required to revoke the license and seize any guns. The people in the database are barred from obtaining a permit until their names are purged.\\"Anemona Hartocollis, Mental Health Issues Put 34,500 on New York’s No-Guns List, New York Times (October 19, 2014). * The Act requires owners to report lost or stolen guns and ammunition to authorities, and makes it a misdemeanor to fail to report such a loss or theft within 24 hours.A closer look at New York State’s gun laws, Obama’s directives, Buffalo News (January 9, 2016). * The Act created a universal background check provision, requiring all sellers or other transferors of firearms and ammunition to conduct background checks (through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS) of the prospective purchaser or other transferees, in \\"all sales, exchanges or disposals of firearms, rifles or shotguns\\" or ammunition, except those between immediate family members, provided that the transferring family member does not know that the transferee \\"is prohibited by law from possessing a firearm.\\"James B. Jacobs & Zoe Fuhr, Universal Background Checking – New York State's SAFE Act, 79 Albany Law Review (forthcoming 2016). The Act requires that a prospective firearm transferor and transferee process the sale via a federally licensed dealer (FFL), but \\"does not mandate that FFLs play this processing role.\\" \\"An FFL, who does elect to provide the service, may not charge the parties more than $10 per transaction. The seller may leave the gun with the licensed dealer, but the purchaser must appear in person to show identification and fill out an ATF Form 4473,\\" which is retained by the FFL. * The Act requires those who live with a household member \\"who has been convicted of a felony or domestic violence crime, has been involuntarily committed, or is currently under an order of protection\\" to \\"safely store\\" any guns, using \\"an appropriate locking device including a trigger lock, a gun safe, or a secure gun cabinet.\\" Failure to do so is made a misdemeanor.Teri Weaver, New York's new gun law: Answers to some questions, Syracuse.com (January 16, 2013). * The Act amended New York Penal Law to establish \\"tougher penalties for those who use illegal guns as well as measures to help combat gang violence.\\" The murder of a first responder engaged in official duties was made a Class A-1 felony, with a mandatory life- without-parole sentence. This was the \\"Webster provision,\\" named for the 2012 Webster, New York shooting, in which two firefighters were fatally shot by an arsonist.Jon Campbell, Webster Gun Provision, WENY (January 15, 2013).New York Senate passes tough gun law, Gannett Company (January 1, 2013). The Act increases illegal possession of an unloaded gun and possession of a firearm on school grounds or a school from misdemeanors to a Class E felonies. The Act provided that recklessly injuring a child by a firearm, as well as selling or transferring a gun to an individual known to be prohibited from possessing a gun, was a Class D felony. The Act provided that \\"sharing a gun with an individual who is not authorized to possess a gun and commits a crime\\" was criminal facilitation. The Act made straw purchasing (buying a gun \\"for someone the buyer knows to be disqualified because of a conviction of a crime, an involuntary commitment or other disqualifier\\") a Class D felony (it was previously a misdemeanor). The Act created a mandatory minimum sentence for using or carrying a firearm in drug trafficking or in committing a violent felony - a minimum of five years if loaded, and three if unloaded, with some discretion for the court to impose lower sentences in drug trafficking cases if mitigating factors are present. The Act allows prosecutors to seek a sentence of 25 years in prison to life imprisonment (an increase from the previous 15 years) in prosecuting gang members when the gang is involved in murder. * The Act requires the holders of handgun permits to be re-certified every five years with the local county clerk or sheriff.Rick Karlin, County clerks: State delays handgun permit updates under NY SAFE Act, Times Union (April 16, 2014). * The Act permits the holders of handgun permit \\"to request that their application information be made exempt from disclosure under state Freedom of Information Law.\\" This was in response to a controversial website set up in 2010 that published the names of permit holders. Support Support for the SAFE Act was strongly polarized by region, with strong support in New York City and its suburbs, but opposition in upstate New York.Thomas Kaplan, Cuomo's Gun Law Plays Well Downstate but Alienates Upstate, New York Times (October 24, 2014). Fourteen months after its passage, a Siena College poll showed that 63% of registered New York voters statewide said that they support the SAFE Act, but only 45% Upstate voters did.New Yorkers Favor SAFE Act 2-1, Poll Says, WWNY-TV (March 24, 2014) (see raw polling numbers). The New York Times reported that in Upstate New York, \\"Counties, towns and villages have passed resolutions denouncing the laws, and some counties have even demanded that their official seals not be used on any paperwork relating to them. In response to an open records request, the governor's office shared hundreds of pages of such resolutions, from far-flung places like the Adirondack town of North Hudson, with 238 residents, to more populous areas like Erie County.\\" By contrast, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. strongly supported the law, saying that it would \\"provide law enforcement with stronger tools to protect our communities from gun violence, including provisions that better enable us to combat gun trafficking and violent gangs, and others that close the state gun show loophole and regulate large-quantity sales of ammunition and firearms.\\"New York passes major gun control law - first since Newtown massacre, NBC News (January 15, 2013). Following the passage of the Act, the New York State Sheriff's Association (NYSSA) wrote a letter offering a mixed opinion on the SAFE Act. The NYSSA favored the parts of the law that enhanced sentences for violent offenses committed with a gun, expanded background checks, and mandated safe storage of guns in households that included a member ineligible to legally use guns. The NYSSA opposed the parts of the law that expanded the definition of assault weapons, limited magazine usage, and limited ammunition sales via the Internet.Sheriffs' Response to NY SAFE Act , New York State Sheriff's Association. Criticisms County opposition to SAFE Act A number of anti-SAFE Act rallies have been held at the New York State Capitol in Albany; one in 2014 featured Donald Trump, Rob Astorino, and Carl Paladino, and drew some 3,000 gun enthusiasts.Rick Karlin, Voter bloc hears stars Trump, Paladino; Astorino shows up, Albany Times Union (April 2, 2014).Gino Geruntino, Critics speak out against SAFE Act during Albany rally, WRVO (April 2, 2014).

The law was criticized as \\"rushed through\\" by the state legislature without consideration of whether it would criminalize police and other law enforcement officers who carry firearms with magazines with a larger capacity than those allowed for civilians. Republicans in the New York Legislature have made a number of unsuccessful efforts over a series of years to repeal the Act; these efforts have been led by State Senator Kathleen A.

Some mental health experts expressed concerns that the law might interfere with their treatment of potentially dangerous individuals, or discourage such people from seeking treatment. The United States Veterans Health Administration (VA) has already said they will not comply with the provision requiring release of certain mental health records as it violates federal patient confidentiality laws. Others claimed that this is a backdoor ban on handgun sales, noting that seven-round magazines simply do not exist for many popular models. After realizing seven-round magazines do not exist for most firearms, New York governor Andrew Cuomo reversed his position on the seven- round limit, stating, \\"There is no such thing as a seven-bullet magazine [sic]. That doesn't exist, so you really have no practical option.\\" He went on to say the state needs to allow the sale of handguns and rifles with ten-round magazines, but requires the people of New York only load seven rounds in them, except at shooting ranges and competitions. He claimed the law is still enforceable. Cuomo and New York State Senate leaders planned an indefinite suspension of the seven-round magazine limit until they could rewrite the measure. In March 2013 during budget negotiations, Cuomo and lawmakers agreed to continue to allow 10-round magazines to be sold, but could still only be loaded with 7 cartridges.Magazine limit, gun registration period to begin Monday. Democratandchronicle.com, April 13, 2013 Since its enactment in 2013, the number of assault weapons required to be registered has not met expectations, suggesting non-compliance with the law. By 2015, only around 45,000 such registrations were performed while the estimated number of assault weapons requiring registration nears 1 million. Legal challenges On March 11, 2013, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs announced that it would not follow the provision of the NY SAFE Act requiring mental health professionals to report patients who seem more likely to hurt themselves or others. A Department spokesman stated that federal laws protecting the privacy of veterans take precedence over state laws. Advocates for military veterans had expressed concern that the reporting requirement would deter some people from seeking needed treatment.Virtanen, Michael (March 11, 2013). \\"VA Says It Won't Follow New York Gun Law\\", Huffington Post. Retrieved March 11, 2013. Robert L. Schulz and several hundred other gun-rights activists pursued a legal challenge against the NY SAFE Act in New York state court, arguing that the act was unconstitutional as Governor Cuomo's use of a \\"message of necessity\\" to waive the usual three-day waiting period had violated the New York State Constitution. Judge Thomas J. McNamara of the New York Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' request for an injunction and later dismissed the challenge, finding no constitutional violation.Teri Weaver, NY judge dismisses lawsuit challenging Safe Act, Syracuse.com (April 16, 2016). A separate challenge took place in federal court. In December 2013, Chief U.S. District Judge William M. Skretny, of the Federal District Court in Buffalo, upheld most of the New York SAFE Act, saying that its provisions \\"further the state's important interest in public safety.... it does not totally disarm New York's citizens; and it does not meaningfully jeopardize their right to self- defense\\". However he struck down the provision that only seven rounds of ammunition could be loaded into a ten-round magazine, calling it \\"an arbitrary restriction\\" that violated the Second Amendment, and saying that it could result in \\"pitting the criminal with a loaded magazine against the law-abiding citizen limited to seven rounds.\\" The New York State Rifle and Pistol Association dropped its suit in March 2016. Following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, it decided it was unlikely to win a favorable Supreme Court opinion. Subsequent amendments The NY SAFE Act as originally passed did not explicitly exempt police officers from some of the law's provisions, such as the seven-round limit, although older law (not repealed by the NY SAFE Act) did provide such an exemption. This prompted some initial confusion, but the office of Governor Andrew Cuomo said soon after passage that police officers were exempt from the seven-round limit. In July 2013, Cuomo signed into law a measure that expressly exempted qualified retired law enforcement officers from some of the provisions of the Act. The exemption allows retired officers (who served for at least ten years and left in good standing) to retain guns and magazines purchased as part of official duty, so long as registered with the state within 60 days of retiring.Teri Weaver, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signs amendment to NY Safe Act allowing exceptions for retired police, Syracuse.com (July 8, 2013).Nick Reismanm Cuomo Approves Law Enforcement Exemption In SAFE Act, Capital Tonight, Time Warner Cable News Capital Region, (July 8, 2013).Glenn Blain, NY Gov.

Impact on gun manufacturers In 2013, Moon Kook-jin's Kahr Arms of Pearl River, a gun manufacturer, announced that it would be moving its headquarters from New York to Pennsylvania after the passing of the NY SAFE Act. The company also announced that it would be building a manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania, rather than Orange County, New York, as it had looked into.Firearms maker blames New York gun law for move to Pennsylvania, Associated Press (August 8, 2013). In 2014, the Remington Arms Co. decided to open a manufacturing plant in Huntsville, Alabama. The president of United Mine Workers Local 717, which represents workers at Remington's existing plant in Ilion, New York expressed fears about the future of the New York facility and blaming the NY SAFE Act for the company's decision to expand in Alabama rather than New York. However, \\"Remington has not given any public indications that it is planning to move out of Ilion. In fact, it has spent more than $20 million on new equipment for its factory in Ilion and added 560 jobs at the plant\\" in the few years before 2014.Rick Moriarty, Union official blames Remington Arms expansion in Alabama on NY SAFE Act, Syracuse.com (February 15, 2015).

His first connection to Ted Roof came from 2007-2010 while working for the Minnesota Golden Gophers as the linebackers coach under Roof. The Houston Texans hired Butler as a defensive assistant in the off-season, but then was hired by South Carolina where he served for one year. Butler re-united with Roof on Bill O'Brien's staff at Penn State. After Roof moved back to his alma mater at Georgia Tech, Butler was promoted to defensive coordinator over two more experienced assistants, linebackers coach Ron Vanderlinden and defensive line coach Larry Johnson. =Professional= In early 2014, Butler left Penn State to join O'Brien's Houston Texans staff as secondary coach. On January 2, 2018 he was fired by the Houston Texans. On January 30, 2018 Butler was hired by the Buffalo Bills coaching staff under head coach and former high school teammate Sean McDermott.

Over time, many different styles of deck railing have been developed. Deck railing designs Mountain laurel railings on a timber frame porch.The most common residential deck railing design is built on-site using pressure treated lumber, with the vertical balusters regularly spaced to meet building code. Wood railing could be in different styles such as Victorian, Chippendale railing and others. A popular alternative to wood railing is composite lumber and PVC railing. Cable railings typically use stainless steel cables strung horizontally. Stainless- steel cable and fasteners are strong and don’t obscure the view. Contemporary frame systems use plastic-coated steel cables. Glass balusters and glass panels are often used at contemporary architectural projects where unobstructed view is important. All-glass railing without a top rail can be used to maximize the effect. There are, however, cleaning, security, and wildlife protection issues. Other options include wrought iron and sheet steel, into which custom designs can be cut. Ornamental cast-iron railing was popular in the latter half of the XIX century and it is often associated with the Victorian style and with the traditional architecture of American coastal southern cities like Savannah and New Orleans. Deck railing and building code Building code varies on the national, state, county and municipal level. Most areas in the world that use a variation of the International Building Code require a guard rail if there is a difference of 30\\" or more between platforms. Other common requirements are that no space on the railing be greater than that through which a 4\\" sphere could pass and that the railing assembly be able to withstand a load of 50 pounds per square foot. Deck railing construction Cable Railing on Residential Deck overlooking a LakeThe typical deck railing is generally built from pressure treated lumber. Posts on a deck are also typically pressure treated wood and standard sizes are 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8. These posts give structural support to the railing assembly and are the most critical part for the safety of the guard rail assembly. In between the posts, two 2x4s are attached to the posts with screws for the best connection. The lower board is placed 3.5\\" from the top of the finish deck to the bottom of the board. The top board is placed with the top at 35\\" from the deck. Then the vertical 2x2 pressure treated wood balusters are installed spaced regularly every 3.5\\". Then a 2x6 is installed horizontally across the top of the posts and to 2x4. The 2x6 should be fastened with screws to the posts and 2x4 boards for the most rigidity. Mountain Laurel Railings are curved to match a circular deck on a log home.Mountain laurel handrail, glass baluster systems, metal baluster systems, and composite railing systems all install in a similar manner. The differences is in the type of baluster installed. All four of these deck railings can be built using pressure treated lumber, another wood like cedar, or composite lumber to provide the structure. Wrought iron and other metal railing systems that do not come in ready-to- install kits will usually require a skilled blacksmith as much welding will be required. These sections are typically built off-site in a workshop under controlled conditions, so that installation on the job site can be as speedy as possible.

Yang was active in the East Asian media and entertainment industry, having helped many performers achieve fame, including Chang Fei, Kevin Chu, Brigitte Lin, and Sally Yeh. He was linked to organized crime and imprisoned on Green Island in 1985. In October 1986, Yang and Lo Fu-chu, among others, founded the Tiendaomeng, also known as the Celestial Alliance. Yang was released in 1988 and helped finance Hou Hsiao-hsien's A City of Sadness, only to be jailed again in 1990 on suspicion of gambling. Yang was later freed from Green Island, and in 1992 founded Taiwan's first cable television station. The next year, he funded Jet Li's Fong Sai-yuk. In 1995, Yang was awarded NT$480,000 in compensation for imprisonment without due process during Taiwan's martial law era. He left Taiwan soon after a television station he owned became involved in betting on the Chinese Professional Baseball League. Yang returned in 1997 to establish Gala Television. By the late 1990s, he had become chairman of the Association for Cable Broadcasting Development. Yang's collaboration with Hou Hsiao-hsien continued with the production of Goodbye South, Goodbye in 1996 and Flowers of Shanghai in 1998.

He graduated from high school in 1927. A local attorney, impressed with his work ethic, paid for Valle's attendance at the Hebron Academy where Valle starred as halfback on the school's football team. After leaving school, Valle worked in the insurance business and although he was successful, was more interested in starting his own business. His opportunity arose when Franklin Delano Roosevelt became president and repealed Prohibition. In 1933, Valle purchased a small 12-seat café in Portland that had obtained a beer and wine license. Valle quickly built up a clientele and earned enough money to expand. His ability to sell reasonably priced steak dinners in his café convinced him to open a full-service restaurant in Portland, not far from his café. Valle's business philosophy was to sell high quality dinners to the average person. > \\"I was convinced that by keeping the margin of profit down, I could make up > the difference by volume business. I knew the public still liked a good meal > at a fair price and that's what I tried to offer.\\" Valle's continued success allowed him to purchase a nightclub in Scarborough, Maine, in 1936 and convert that into his second restaurant.Haskell, David (October 17, 1969) \\"Shined Shoes, Now a Millionaire\\" Cumberland Evening Times, page 10  Creating the Valle's Steak House Chain  After operating a small cafe, Donald Valle purchased a larger restaurant in Portland, Maine and named it \\"Valle's Steak House\\" In 1950, Valle built his first custom steak house in Kittery, Maine. Subsequently, he began expanding beyond Maine and opened additional restaurants in New England. In 1968 the company went public and its shares were listed on the American Stock Exchange.FitzGerald, Joan (July 8, 1980) \\"What's Cooking Down at Valle's\\" The Boston Globe, page 1. By 1969 Valle was buying $4,000,000 worth of beef and lobsters and was serving over 200,000 people a week. The restaurant chain employed 1,300 people and had also created and issued over 6,000 of its own credit cards. Valle continued expanding the company south to Florida during the 1970s with the intent to eventually expand throughout the United States and open restaurants on the West Coast. The success of the company attracted a buyout offer from Campbell Soup Company in 1970. At the time of the offer, Valle was operating 12 restaurants in Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York and had five additional restaurants being developed. Campbell offered to purchase all of the company's assets and assume its liabilities for $38,900,000.Hammer, Alexander R. (October 13, 1970) \\"Campbell Seeking Valle's\\" The New York Times, page 65.

Photo taken in 1940. The California agricultural strikes of 1933 were a series of strikes by mostly Mexican and Filipino agricultural workers throughout the San Joaquin Valley. More than 47,500 workers were involved in the wave of approximately 30 strikes from 1931-1941. Twenty-four of the strikes, involving 37,500 union members, were led by the Cannery and Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union (CAWIU). The strikes are grouped together because most of them were organized by the CAWIU. Strike actions began in August among cherry, grape, peach, pear, sugar beet, and tomato workers, and culminated in a number of strikes against cotton growers in the San Joaquin Valley in October. The cotton strikes involved the largest number of workers. Sources vary as to numbers involved in the cotton strikes, with some sources claiming 18,000 workers and others just 12,000 workers, 80% of whom were Mexican. In the cotton strikes of 1933, striking workers were evicted from company housing while growers and managerial staff were deputized by local law enforcement. Attacks by employers on peaceful striking workers were common and the surrounding community of bankers, merchants, ministers, and Boy Scouts encouraged the attacks. As a sheriff stated, \\"We protect our farmers here in Kern county. But the Mexicans are trash. They have no standard of living. We herd them like pigs.\\" In Pixley, California, two strikers, Dolores Hernàndez and Delfino D'Ávila, were murdered and eight others wounded after \\"local sheriffs handed out six hundred citizen's permits to carry concealed weapons.\\" Eight growers faced charges in the shootings, but all were acquitted. Another man, Pedro Subia, was murdered near Arvin, California. Workers came from camps from all around the Bakersfield area to commemorate his life at Bakersfield City Hall. CAWIU organizers Pat Chambers and Caroline Decker were arrested and charged under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act for their labor organizing activities. Culmination Cotton growers in the San Joaquin Valley used extremely low labor costs to become the leading producer of the staple in the country, producing more cotton per acre than the Old South. Although California cotton growers paid marginally better than cotton growers in other states, wages for cotton pickers in California had declined significantly from $1.50 per hundred pounds in 1928 to just 40 cents per hundred pounds in 1932 (although the rate could go as high as 60 cents per hundred pounds for ground being picked over a second or third time). Wages for cotton pickers in the San Joaquin Valley were set by the Agricultural Labor Bureau, an employers' organization. In 1929, the Great Depression lowered the demand for cotton and many marginal planters lost their assets to Bank of America and others who held the notes. The US government bailed the growers out in 1933, offering them subsidies. The pickers hoped the growers would support them with the bailout, but this did not happen, which prompted the strike. The Cannery and Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union, a communist worker's organization, had been organizing in the cotton fields for some time, and by 1933 had come to provide leadership for the cotton pickers, most of whom were Mexican. The CAWIU was militant in its demands, and threatened a valley-wide strike if they were not met. These demands included a wage rate of $1.00 per hundred pounds of cotton picked, recognition of the CAWIU as the workers' collective bargaining agent, and abolition of \\"contract labor\\" (the contracting of a large group of workers for a one-time job or for seasonal labor). These demands were made in practically every cotton strike which followed in 1933. On September 18th, the cotton strikes were organized by a group of seventy-eight men and women who \\"concluded that it took the average picker 10 hours to harvest 300 pounds. Planters offered 40 cents a hundredweight – that was not enough to buy enough food and gas to get to the next job. The workers demanded a dollar per hundredweight.\\" The planters reluctantly raised their offer to 60 cents, following public pressure, but this was not enough, so the strike began.  The cotton strikes of October 1933  The cotton strikes began on October 4, 1933 with the establishment of picket lines by workers at the work site: \\"At the Camp. West and Lowe ranch, the pickets were uncommunicative, but it was learned through their captain that the picketers are organized for shifts continuing throughout twenty-four hours. All wore signs reading 'This ranch under strike.'\\" The strike was primarily organized by women, because of their complex social networks which allowed them to communicate across worker camps and share when and where a strike would take place. The Los Angeles Times reported that the rationale for the strikes was to obtain \\"a rate increase of 40 cents a hundred pounds for picketers over the rate established at the recent meeting of the San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Bureau, and which cotton growers throughout Kern county agreed to support. The rate as established is 60 cents per hundred pounds.\\" When growers initially received word of the strike, they mobilized an all-out war against them. Seventy-five Kings County planters gave pickers and their families five minutes to load all their belongings on trucks and then dumped them in the highway. \\"The sheriff and I told the growers not to worry about the pickers' rights anyway,\\" said Kings County District Attorney Clarence Wilson. Fortunately for the workers the Cannery and Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union had rented camp spaces close to the cotton-picking centers, the most important one being in Corcoran, California. The townspeople barely tolerated the Mexican workers and accessing basic needs like health care was difficult. As one Corcoran nurse stated \\"No, we have to give her a bath first. You Mexicans are all dirty.\\" On the first day of the strike, a California Highway Patrol vehicle came through the town, two blocks from the railroad crossing, with a machine gun mounted. Rudy Castro, a witness, stated that \\"they were ready to mow down these strikers, all because they had the audacity to ask for more money.\\" There were nearly 3,800 strikers at the Corcoran camp, and the workers outnumbered the townspeople almost two to one. A tent school was established at the camp for about seventy children, while, in another area of the camp, Corcoran resident Lino Sànchez facilitated nightly meetings. Three days into the protests, the cotton growers became concerned that their cotton crop was not going to be picked at its peak value, and that angry workers would destroy their crops or harm workers who engaged in strikebreaking. Two days later, the strike turned violent and workers were evicted from company housing. in Tulare County, armed men employed by the growers clashed with striking workers and CAWIU labor organizers, and CAWIU staff were forcibly ejected out of the county. Growers in Kings, Fresno, Madera, Merced Stanislaus, and San Luis Obispo counties armed themselves and their employees, announcing they would drive off any troublemakers. In Kern County, about 200 strikers and their families were evicted from their employer-owned cottages, their belongings dumped on the road, and told to get out of the county or face trouble. Tensions reached a peak on October 10 in Pixley when about 30 ranchers surrounded a meeting of striking workers. The ranchers fired on the strikers, killing three and wounded a number of others. That same day, a group of striking grape pickers faced a group of armed growers' men at a farm near Arvin, California, about south of Pixley. After several hours confronting one another at the border of the employer's land, the two sides began attacking each other (the workers armed with wooden poles, the growers' men using the butt of their rifles). A shot rang out and a striking worker, Pedro Subia, was killed. A sheriff's deputy threw a tear gas grenade at the group, and the growers' men opened fire. Several strikers were wounded. End of the cotton strikes The cotton strikes came to a halt at the end of October. The killings at Pixley and Arvin led to public condemnation of the growers' actions, and California Highway Patrol flooded the area to restore order. Federal and state strike mediators arrived to try to end the strikes, and federal welfare and public works officials arrived to see what they could do to end economic problems that might be causing the strikes. Angry workers wished to engage in armed reprisal against growers, but CAWIU leaders were able to prevent this. Public opinion supported the strikers so strongly now that California Governor James Rolph agreed to meet with union leaders to receive their demands. Although Rolph declined to send in more police or disarm growers, he did announce that the State Emergency Relief Administration would spend federal money to provide financial assistance to striking workers. George Creel, chair of the Regional Labor Board of the National Labor Board (a federal labor relations agency), began to aggressively intervene as a mediator in the strikes. Although Creel lacked any formal powers, his bravado and air of authority impressed both growers and union workers. He warned growers that the Roosevelt administration would suspend federal agricultural assistance to California if violence continued, and proposed a three-member fact-finding commission to settle the strike. The growers agreed. Because Creel had assured the growers that workers would return to work at the rate of 60 cents per hundred pounds while the commission did its work, both the federal government and state officials mounted a major \\"back to work\\" effort to end the strikes on October 14. The effort failed. When state officials conditioned the receipt of relief payments on a return to work, striking workers refused to accept them. The state unconditionally resumed payments on October 21. The commission held its hearings on October 19 and 20. Pushed by Creel, the commission announced on October 23 that growers should offer a rate of 75 cents per hundred. The growers accepted this solution on October 25. CAWIU asked for 80 cents per hundred and recognition of the union, but Creel said relief payments would be completely cut off if the workers did not agree to the commission's rate. Although workers were apparently overwhelmingly in favor of continuing the strikes, CAWIU leaders agreed to the commission's solution on October 26 and called an end to all cotton strikes then ongoing in California.

The software lets users discover independently owned points of interest in the United States and Canada. Once a trip is saved, it can be synced to the Roadtrippers iPhone app, for turn-by-turn navigation, and further local discovery while on the road. Since 2011, the team at Roadtrippers have worked on securing investments and growing the business. The company was founded by James Fisher and Tatiana Parent. The headquarters are in Cincinnati, Ohio. History= Origins (2011-2012) = Roadtrippers co-founder James Fisher grew up traveling. His family ran a safari company in Africa. His fellow co-founder, Tatiana Parent, shares his passion for travel, having traveled the USA extensively herself. Fisher and Parent brainstormed the idea of Roadtrippers in 2010. They were frustrated with the lack of useful travel resources. Particularly for finding independent places to visit, and syncing travel advice with navigation. This frustration led them to create Roadtrippers. Fisher and Parent moved from Great Britain in 2011 to focus on their company. In July 2011, The Brandery, a Cincinnati-based startup accelerator, accepted Roadtrippers into its program. The Brandery's aim is to helps new businesses with securing funding, gaining mentors, and networking with business professionals. In June 2012, the company launched a public beta version of its application. The application allowed use of the unpolished software in order to gain feedback for the website's full release. = Expansion = Roadtrippers official website launched in July 2012. Roadtrippers has since grown to a team of 25 full-time employees including John Lauck, appointed VP of Engineering in 2012. The company has a team of developers and designers as well as a network of travel content creators. The Roadtrippers team expanded the company outside of the United States to Canada, the United Kingdom, and Israel. On November 2012, after working with app developer Forest Giant, Roadtrippers released a companion iPhone app. The app was launched on Gizmodo app of the day on Nov 19th, 2012. In December 2012, Roadtrippers reached 1 million monthly users. In November 2014, Roadtrippers released version 3.0 of its iOS app. The new version does not require the user to create an account to use the app. It does include weather forecasting and icons for users to select what they are interested in (e.g., diners, hiking, discover locations nearby. Roadtrippers was recognized on TIME's 50 Best Websites of 2014. In 2018, Roadtrippers was acquired by Thor Industries/Tourist Holdings Inc. In February 2019, Roadtrippers Plus was added as a paid feature service. Initial discounted offering was $10 for a year subscription to existing Roadtrippers App users for limited time. Free version was downgraded from 60 waypoints per trip down to 6, severely limiting the usefulness of the free version. Shortly after the initial offering, the price for a year subscription jumped to the current rate of $30/year.  Funding  Through 2012, the company secured $500,000 in venture funding from CincyTech, Vine St. Ventures, Ludlow Ventures and a number of angel investors. In August 2013, the company received a $2.5 million investment from Drive Capital for expansion.  Features  The Roadtrippers application lets travelers plan trips, calculate time and gas expense, and choose from over 5 million independent locations in the United States to visit. The application used to heavily rely on Google Maps API, but has since moved to MapBox. Users can plan their routes and select interests from categories and sub-categories within 10–30 miles of the main route. The areas of interest are then displayed on the map, and the mileage and gas costs are recalculated. The application road trip planner calculates approximate trip mileage, travel time, and fuel cost. Trip itineraries built on the Roadtrippers web platform sync with the iPhone app and Android app. The Roadtrippers proprietary search accesses a database of over 5 million points of interest. Users can also discover locations by selecting categories of interest. Categories include accommodations, food and drink, history, nature, culture, shopping, sports and more. Users can also rate, review, and read what other users have to say about points of interest. Users with a free Roadtrippers account have the option to \\"save\\" locations that they are interested to a public profile. Roadtrippers \\"guides\\" are curated lists of locations (e.g., \\"Diners to Die For,\\" \\"Wine Country,\\" \\"Geektown\\" and \\"Mad Science\\"). The Roadtrippers team began building features to enable hotel booking via the application in September 2012 In September 2015, Roadtrippers incorporated hotel meta search to display prices from multiple hotel booking providers on specific accommodations. In May 2015 Roadtrippers launched a watch app. The application is backed by Roadtrippers database of over 5 million points of interest. It ranks locations by user rating and displays the highest rated points of interest \\"nearby\\". Adoption According to Alexa, Roadtrippers is ranked at 28,884 in the USA. As of January 2013, the service has 160,000 users, making it one of the fastest growing US travel sites launched in 2012. Challenges While Roadtrippers offers over 50,000 attractions in the United States, reviews written in 2012 said it still had a ways to go, and needed more attractions in order to garner new and repeat users.

Gone Home was first released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux computers in August 2013, followed by console releases for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in January 2016, the Nintendo Switch in September 2018, and iOS in December 2018. Set in the year 1995, Gone Home puts the player in the role of a young woman returning from overseas to her rural Oregon family home to find her family currently absent and the house empty, leaving her to piece together recent events. Gone Home does not feature much interactivity, but instead has the player explore the house at their own pace and determine what has transpired by examining items, journals, and other items left around the various rooms. The Fullbright team, having previously worked on BioShock 2: Minerva's Den, took concepts and ideas from that game to craft an exploration game to engage the player in uncovering the narration by non-linear progression by searching the house, while keeping the project manageable for their small team. Gone Home was critically praised at release. Several outlets used the game as an example of video games as art, as its non- standard gameplay format demonstrates progression of the video game industry into more artistic forms. However, this also raised the question of whether Gone Home should be considered a game, and led to the derogatory term \\"walking simulators\\" to describe exploration games with little interactivity, though since then, the industry has come to embrace the term. Gone Homes characters and story were praised for addressing LGBT issues with which some players could identify.  Gameplay  The player takes the role of Katie in the first-person view, who can move around the house and view and interact with objects. There are no defined goals in the game; however, the game encourages and rewards the player when they explore new areas of the house and search for new messages. Much of the interactivity rests upon looking at objects and notes within the house. In order to progress in the game, the player must find certain objects that unlock access to other parts of the house.  Plot  The launch trailer sets the scene for the game On 7 June 1995, 21-year-old Katie Greenbriar (voiced by Sarah Elmaleh) returns home from overseas to her family's new home in fictional Boon County, Oregon. Her family consists of her father, Terry, a failed writer who makes a living reviewing home electronics; her mother, Janice, a wildlife conservationist who recently got promoted to director; and her 17-year-old sister Samantha (voiced by Sarah Grayson). Upon arriving, she finds the house deserted, much of their possessions still in moving boxes, and a note on the door from Sam imploring Katie not to investigate what happened. Searching the house, Katie begins to piece together what happened during her absence. After moving in, Samantha found it difficult to adjust to her new high school, but eventually made friends with another girl, Yolanda \\"Lonnie\\" DeSoto, a JROTC cadet. The two bonded over Street Fighter, punk rock, grunge and the burgeoning riot grrrl movement, and after sneaking off to a concert, the two became romantically involved. After various incidents at school, Sam's parents found out about her relationship, forbade Sam to close her bedroom door while Lonnie was over, and went into denial that their daughter is a lesbian. As Lonnie was set to eventually ship out to begin her service, Sam was left distraught. Two days after her farewell show, which coincides with the day of Katie's homecoming, and the week of Sam's parents going on a vacation (which is revealed to actually be a counseling trip instead of a camping trip, as they told others), Lonnie departed to her station, but eventually called Sam from a payphone to tell her that she got off the bus in Salem and she wanted them to be together. Sam's final journal entry to Katie explains that she packed up her things and took her car to find Lonnie, hoping to start a new life with her outside of Oregon. Optionally, Katie can find various other clues that provide information on additional events that happened during the time: it is implied that Janice was beginning to have romantic feelings towards a subordinate, and that Terry was berated by his father via letter about his failed writing work, as well as Sam and Lonnie's suspicion that the house was haunted by the deceased Oscar Masan, Terry's uncle and former owner of the house. It is also implied that Terry's decision to write about a character traveling back in time to 1963 to stop the Kennedy assassination may have been influenced by his own sexual abuse by Masan, which either occurred or ended in 1963, when he was 13 years old.  Development  The Fullbright Company at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2014. From left, Kate Craig, Steve Gaynor, Johnnemann Nordhagen and Karla Zimonja Fullbright was founded by Steve Gaynor, Karla Zimonja, and Johnnemann Nordhagen as \\"The Fullbright Company\\". The three had previously worked together at 2K Games on BioShock 2: Minerva's Den. All three were drawn by the prospect of developing an exploration game influenced by Minerva's Den through a small independent team rather than a large company, and subsequently left 2K Games to form Fullbright. To reduce costs, the team moved into a house together in Portland, Oregon, and set up the office in the basement, with Gone Home being their first game. Gaynor considered their previous work on the BioShock games as effectively the pre-production stage for Gone Home, allowing them to complete it within seventeen months. The rapid development was aided by first prototyping the game in Amnesia: The Dark Descents HPL Engine 2 (which Gaynor had prior experience with), before completing the game in the Unity 4 game engine. The initial concept for Gone Home was for the player to explore a smart house that included a central artificial intelligence running everything with robots running around to complete tasks. The player would have been able to change the state of the house through their actions; Gaynor compared this idea to a non-combative System Shock game. As they explored this idea, and recognizing the small size of their team, they considered what would change if they made the house more like a regular household without any other characters visibly present, which significantly simplified the development into something more manageable for the team. This created the focus of the game as being \\"no other people, no other characters, [just] you in a single environment\\". The reduced scope allowed them to complete the game with the three of them for programming, narrative, and 2D art assets, along with remote work from Kate Craig for the game's 3D modeling. Particularly, the smaller scope eliminated the need for any type of character modeler or animator. Craig's wife Emily Carroll, a comic artist whom Gaynor was a fan of, also assisted by designing some of the game's art asset and logos. Narratively, Gone Home was designed around family; Gaynor had stated that for all the science fiction trappings of Minerva's Den, its core narrative was about a man, his wife, and how the man's past was affecting that relationship, and used the same approach for Gone Home. They placed the player as one of the members of the family to remove any type of morality of exploring a house that did not belong to them. Additionally, they established that the family had only recently moved into the home; Gaynor had worried that the player would have difficulty identifying key elements that would be present among all the other objects within a well lived-in home, while within a recent move, only objects of immediate importance would have been unpacked, making it easy for the player to focus on these. Fullbright set the game in 1995 because they considered it the most recent year in which technology had not made the majority of communication digital in nature, so that they did not have to account for how digital communication would affect their storytelling, while still keeping elements of the game familiar to players. Another source of inspiration was urban exploration, particularly Japanese haikyo, homes long abandoned due to industrialization. Gaynor said there were mysteries about its residents that people could put together from examining the state of the abandoned home. Gaynor stated that Minerva's Den was more focused on environmental storytelling than action-driven gameplay, and set the approach and necessary design elements they needed for Gone Home. Other elements that informed Gone Home from their BioShock experience was non-linear levels to explore, and discovering narrative elements through audio logs that the player would have to actively seek out, both which supported the exploration elements of the game. Gaynor also considered the approach that Looking Glass Studios used for developing immersive sims. One challenge that Fullbright considered was that not every player would necessarily find every narrative clue for the various plot elements, and so it was necessary for them to make the story flexible enough that the player could understand these narratives without necessarily seeing every element they designed. Gaynor was aware this approach to a game would be considered unconventional, so they did not set out to make something avant-garde but instead more as a proof of concept that such games could be immersive to draw the player in to fully explore and come to understand the narrative themselves. The player explores objects around the house to piece together the story. Much of the game's art is influenced by the riot grrrl movement of the mid-1990s. The game features music from the riot grrrl bands Heavens to Betsy and Bratmobile; Fullbright knew of their Portland-based label Kill Rock Stars, and worked early on with them to secure the rights to the music once they had settled on the locale and time period. After showing the game at Grrrl Front Fest, a Portland riot grrrl music festival, it attracted the attention of a local band, The Youngins, who went on to provide the music for Girlscout, the fictional band in the game. The game's original musical score was composed by Chris Remo, Gaynor's friend and co-host from the Idle Thumbs podcast, and featuring over 30 minutes of music that accompany the game's main exploration gameplay, with unique music also scored to each of the game's audio logs. A developer commentary mode was added as a free update to the game in October 2013. = Ports = A console version of the game was in development by Midnight City; however, this was later cancelled following Midnight City's closure in March 2015. Later, the development of the console port for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were switched to Majesco Entertainment, and were released on 12 January 2016. These ports included enhanced graphics and audio, and used the updated Unity 5 game engine. Gone Home was released for the Nintendo Switch on 6 September 2018 through support of publisher Annapurna Interactive. The Switch version includes licensed Super Nintendo Entertainment System game cartridge artwork on in-game objects, replacing fictional cartridges used in other versions, as part of the game's collaboration with Nintendo. Celebrating the game's fifth anniversary, Annapurna Interactive, in collaboration with iam8bit, announced a limited physical release of the game for the Nintendo Switch, alongside a limited vinyl record release for the game's soundtrack, which launched in 2019.  Reception  Gone Home received very positive reviews from game journalists. At Metacritic, the game holds an 86/100 score based on 56 critic reviews. Emily Morganti for Adventure Gamers commented that Gone Home had a \\"realistic, engrossing story that's beautifully told through environmental clues and audio narration\\" and that \\"many people read books for the opportunity to see life through someone else’s eyes, but it’s rare for a game to do it as well as this one does.\\" The Financial Posts Matthew Braga also noted that \\"This is a game that some will hold up as forward-thinking evidence in the ongoing debate of games-as-art\\", adding that the game was made to \\"plumb the depths of experience outside of gaming's typically targeted white, male, youthful core.\\" However, Eurogamer editor Oli Welsh stated \\"The Fullbright Company has built a fine house for intimate storytelling in games, but it hasn't found the story to live in it yet.\\" The game's LGBT themes were praised. Fullbright reported receiving numerous feedback not only from LGBT players of the game that appreciated how they told the story and how such people have to do deal with rejection by their family, but also from players who had opposed LGBT rights who found the game presented the issues related to LGBT to change their mind on the subject. Fullbright also received some criticism from players from focusing on LGBT themes at the expense of other story elements. Due to statements made by the organizers of PAX Prime that Fulbright considered derogatory towards LGBT, the company pulled out of showing Gone Home at the Indie MEGABOOTH showcase during the 2013 PAX Prime event, stressing the importance of respecting LGBT issues. In the wake of this, PAX announced that it would establish Diversity Hubs at its future events for \\"attendees to find information related to issues surrounding women, LGBTQ, people of color, disabled people, and mental health issues in gaming\\". Some reporters have considered the question of whether Gone Home should be considered a video game, as it lacks the normal interactivity one would normally have with a video game. Gaynor asserted that Gone Home was specifically developed for the video game medium, stating that they considered it an \\"edited discussion\\" between Fullbright and the player, as \\"[t]he content that you encounter appears differently than for someone else. It is unique to each user and their interpretation. The interactivity of it makes the experience unique to yourself.\\" Gaynor used the example of the ability to turn lights on or off in any room in the house as an example of this. They included this interactivity as they had developed the game, they found that this gave a means for players to track if they had been within a room before or not, since the house starts otherwise dark, so he considered this one method by which they know what players would likely want to do and providing them means for them to do that, thus making the experience interactive. The lack of interactivity led to Gone Home to be called \\"walking simulators\\" at its release, though since then, the industry has come to accept \\"walking simulators\\" to describe similarly contemplative narrative games with little direct interactivity, like The Stanley Parable, Firewatch, and What Remains of Edith Finch. Gone Homes approach to exploratory storytelling was a point of influence for parts of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Prey. Polygon named Gone Home among most important game of the 2010s for how it shifted games to focus on exploration and narrative over purely active gameplay. Due to both the atypical nature of Gone Home and its narrative centered around LGBT issues, it became a central point of discussion at the onset of the Gamergate controversy in August 2014. A portion of video game players, some who supported the Gamergate movement, criticized games like Gone Home and Depression Quest for lacking the qualities of normal video games while earning praise from the gaming press, as well as including topics like LGBT issues. Critics countered that these elements are part of considering video games as an art form, demonstrating how the medium is changing. =Sales= By September 2013, Fullbright announced that the game had sold more than 50,000 copies. By February 2014, sales had reached 250,000 copies. By the time of release of Tacoma, Fullbright's second game released in October 2017, Gone Home had sold more than 700,000 copies. =Awards and accolades= The game was also nominated for \\"Excellence in Narrative\\" for the Independent Games Festival for 2013. Polygon named Gone Home their Game of the Year for 2013. Gone Home was nominated for several categories at the 2014 Game Developers Choice Awards, including \\"Game of the Year\\", \\"Innovation Award\\", \\"Best Narrative\\", and \\"Best Downloadable Game\\", while Fullbright won as a studio for \\"Best Debut\\" for Gone Home.

These were first registered in Workman's Manuscript under the name Alschoner, a variant of Alexander. The arms have been adapted by several branches of the family. The Alexanders of Menstrie, also known as the House of Alexander, are a sept of Clan MacAlister of Scotland, itself a branch of Clan MacDonald. The family is said to descend from Somerled, Lord of the Isles.McAndrew 2006: p. 473. The seat of the clan was at Menstrie Castle in Menstrie, Clackmannanshire. Descendants of the Alexanders of Menstrie have become prominent in Ireland, England and the United States. History of the clan There have been conflicting origins for this clan, which first became prominent when poet and courtier William Alexander, a great favourite of King James VI, was knighted in 1604. He was given a grant to settle the Colony of Nova Scotia in 1621 and created Viscount of Stirling and Lord Alexander of Tullibody in 1630. Upon the coronation of Charles I in 1633, Alexander was further created Earl of Stirling and Viscount of Canada. On the same occasion he was granted significant lands in British North America, including all of the future province of Canada, the entire territory of Nova Scotia and parts of New England, including Long Island. However, his male line apparently failed upon the death of the fourth earl in 1739. Since then, there have been several attempts by people seeking to claim the titles and their lands, through various pedigrees, but none were successfully proven. =Origins= In a personal memoir, William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling (–1640), cited a \\"misty Highland genealogy\\" in tracing his family origin, in which he claimed descent from Somerled, Lord of the Isles (died 1164), through his descendant John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles (Eoin Carrach MacDomhnaill, 7th Lord of the Isles) of Clan MacDonald. According to Alexander's family history, John married Princess Margaret Stewart, daughter of King Robert II; their son Alexander MacDonald was the father of Angus, who founded the Clan Macalister of Loup Castle. Another son of Angus, also Alexander MacDonald, was given a grant of lands of Menstrie in Stirlingshire from the Earl of Argyll and settled there, and his descendants assumed the English name Alexander as a surname. A similar account is found in The Peerage of Scotland: A Genealogical and Historical Account of all the Peers of the Kingdom (1767), although it stated it was Alexander MacDonald, son of Lord of the Isles and Princess Margaret, who was given the grant for Menstrie from the Argyll family and from whom the family first took its name. It has also been stated that the original family name was Alschoner, a modified form of the patronymic Alexanderson, and that the Alschoners migrated from Angus to Stirlingshire in the 14th century. However, in his authoritative work The Scots Peerage, Sir James Balfour Paul stated that there was no evidence supporting the \\"general assertion\\" that the Alexanders of Menstrie took their name from Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross, son of Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles. Balfour Paul states that the Alexander surname is found in many places in Scottish history, particularly in eastern Scotland. =16th century= According to Balfour Paul, the first record of an Alexander of Menstrie was Thomas Alexander of Menstrie in 1505/6, who was one of 17 assessors in a dispute between David Arnot, Abbot of Cambuskenneth and Sir David Bruce of Clackmannan related to division of the property at Cambuskenneth Abbey. How Thomas Alexander acquired Menstrie is unknown, Balfour Paul wrote, though it is certain the land belonged to the Earl of Argyle. In 1518, Thomas Alexander was listed as a tenant in Tullibody near Menstrie. On 7 April 1526, Colin, Earl of Argyll granted a charter for the lands of Menstrie to Andrew Alexander (probably the son of Thomas) and his wife Catherine Graham in liferent, and their son Alexander Alexander in fee. In February 1527, Alexander Alexander surrendered the lands of Menstrie back to the Earl of Argyll. In 1529, Argyll appointed \\"Alexander Alsynder de Menstrie\\" bailie of Argyll's lands in Clackmannanshire. Over the next few years he and his heirs were granted additional lands in Menstrie and in Perthshire, and he was also referred to as \\"Alexander Alschender\\" and \\"Alschoner\\" of Menstrie. He died in the 1550s and was succeeded by his son William Alexander, who died around 1574. William's younger brother James received a charter of the land of Glencarse in the barony of Alloway from the Earl of Mar. After William's death, his son Alexander succeeded him. Alexander Alexander married Marion Graham and was the father of the first Earl of Stirling. Alexander died in 1580 and his children were entrusted into the care of their great uncle James. =17th century= Further lands of Tillicoultry were added in the 17th century. In 1631, Archibald MacAllister of Tarbert visited Sir William Alexander at Menstry, and during this visit MacAllister acknowledged the Earl as his chief, however the Macalisters of Loup were the rightful chiefs. =Irish branch= Rev. Andrew Alexander moved to Ireland in 1618, settling in Ulster (now Northern Ireland). His son Capt. Andrew Alexander was granted lands of Ballyclose, near Newtown Limavady, County Londonderry, in 1666. However, during the Williamite War in Ireland, Andrew Alexander was attainted for being a Williamite by the ousted King James II in his so-called Patriot Parliament, held in 1689 in Dublin. His grandson Nathaniel Alexander, an alderman of the city of Londonderry, married Elizabeth McClintock of Dunmore, County Donegal, and was the father of James Alexander, who made his fortune as a nabob with the East India Company. He bought Caledon House and was created Earl of Caledon in 1801. Nathaniel Alexander's second son, Robert Alexander of Boom Hall (gifted to him by his younger brother), was the father of Bishop Nathaniel Alexander. Robert Alexander's daughter married Whig politician Sir Robert Ferguson, 2nd Baronet. Lady Jean Alexander, eldest daughter of the first Earl of Stirling, also settled in Ireland, and in 1623 married Hugh Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery. Their son, the 3rd viscount, was created Earl of Mount Alexander in the Irish Peerage, in honour of his mother's family. Field Marshal Sir Sir Harold Alexander was the third son of James Alexander, 4th Earl of Caledon. He was created Earl Alexander of Tunis in 1952.

These were intended for use against the Japanese in the Pacific Ocean. However, the war in the Pacific ended before any of the ships were completed and in the end, only two were lent to Canada. As they were only loaned, the two ships kept their names, unlike the last to have been transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy. The vessel was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 15 November 1945 at Clydebank with the pennant number R20. Crusader was completed on 26 November 1945Blackman, p. 97 and transited to the west coast of Canada via the Azores and the Caribbean Sea. The destroyer was placed in reserve shortly after arrival and remained as such until reactivation for the Korean War. The destroyer was reactivated on 2 April 1951, initially as a training ship for cadets. Crusader performed two tours of service in the Korean War, one prior to and one after the Armistice. The first tour took place from June 1952, lasting until June 1953. The second tour lasted from November 1953 until August 1954. Following the ship's return from the Korean peninsula, Crusader took up a training role. On 14 February 1955, the destroyer departed Esquimalt for Halifax, Nova Scotia for use as a test and evaluation ship. The ship was used as a test platform for the newly developed variable depth sonar in 1958.Milner, p. 207 The destroyer remained in this role until being paid off 15 January 1960 at Halifax.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The Minnesota conference of Methodism was organized in 1845, well before Minnesota became a territory in 1849. The Reverend Benjamin Crist started visiting the Lenora area as a missionary on a circuit between Chatfield and Brownsville in 1854. In 1856 Elder John L. Dyer officially organized the congregation. He donated of land and began construction of a stone building, financed by the sale of lots in the town of Lenora. The Panic of 1857 thwarted the development of the area, though, and many pioneer families moved back east. Dyer left the community and moved to Colorado, where he acquired the nickname \\"Snowshoe Preacher\\". Construction on the church was stalled for the next eight years, with half-completed stone walls. In 1865 the area was seeing financial prosperity again, and a stonemason used material from the large uncompleted church to finish building it as a smaller structure. The church was opened in 1866 and dedicated by the Reverend Daniel Cobb. The area never really prospered, though, since the railroad bypassed Lenora. In the late 1920s, the Lenora church was closed as an active congregation. Preservation The church building has been preserved by a congregation in Newburg. It is now known as the Lenora United Methodist Pioneer Center, and is open for occasional church services, special events, and concerts. It appears much like it did in its pioneer days, with no electricity. Lighting is provided by two oil-fueled chandeliers and oil lamps in wall sconces. Heat is provided by a wood stove, and a reed pump organ and the original wooden pews are still in place.

It was released on March 19, 2013 through Megaforce Records in North America, and three days later in Europe by Nuclear Blast. This was the group's last release to feature lead guitarist Rob Caggiano, who left the band subsequently. The record features cover songs from some of the band's favorite acts of the 1970s, along with two versions of \\"Crawl\\", a song from their previous studio album. The EP was recorded during 2012 at various locations. Although it was initially scheduled to be released as part of a special edition of Worship Music, the record was released both separately and on a deluxe edition. It received favorable reviews by music critics and debuted at number 52 on the Billboard 200, selling approximately 8,500 copies in its first week of release. By April 10, 2013, Anthems had sold 14,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen Soundscan. Background and recording Anthrax intended to release Anthems as a tribute to the bands that influenced them over the years. Vocalist Joey Belladonna explained: \\"These are all bands I grew up with and have listened to forever. It's just great music. I had fun singing these songs and I was happy recording together with Anthrax, doing classic rock songs.\\" When asked how the band got the idea to do such a record, bassist Frank Bello answered: \\"The reason why that happened, if you ever came to an Anthrax sound check, you’d probably hear every other song but an Anthrax song.\\" He further said that the band got the idea while jamming to some older songs. \\"We just wanted to say this is where we also came from. That gave us our start and that is what sparked us.\\" The band started working on this project in the summer of 2012. The album was recorded in 2012 at different locations: at drummer Charlie Benante's home studio, in producer Jay Ruston's New York studio and during tour. Some of the tracks were recorded earlier, during the recording sessions of their previous studio release Worship Music. Benante, in an interview for Loudwire, stated: \\"To commemorate the first year of Worship Music being out, we're putting together a little companion EP with some fun shit on it.\\" The original idea was to record a few songs that would have been placed on a deluxe edition of their previous album, but the band did not manage to finish the project in time. However, when the band had recorded enough songs, they contacted their US and European labels who offered to put out Anthems as a stand-alone EP, a proposal which the band accepted. In addition, Benante and artist Stephen Thompson have redesigned each track's original artwork to \\"Anthrax\\" it.  Composition  Anthems is an eight-track EP which contains cover songs from classic 1970s rock bands that influenced Anthrax. Apart from the six cover tracks, the album features a studio version and a remix of \\"Crawl\\", a song from their previous album Worship Music. The first single released from the EP was the cover of Rush’s \\"Anthem\\", which garnered positive reaction from music critics. Graham Hartmann from Loudwire called the cover version \\"unique, as Anthrax throw their trademark thrash spin on the prog classic\\". The second song released from the record was \\"Smokin'\\" from Boston, which prominently features session keyboardist Fred Mandel. Drummer Charlie Benante explained the selection of the Boston song by saying: \\"One of the great things about \\"Smokin’\\" is that there’s a really cool section that has a real \\"Anthrax-y\\" feel to it, the guitars and drums and playing the same type of rhythm, the kick drums are going with the guitars – I immediately heard in my head what we could do with it.\\" Reception The EP received favorable reviews by music critics. AllMusic reviewer Jason Lymangrover gave the album two-and-a-half stars, saying the tracks are \\"meticulously executed in the fun, dumb spirit that most Anthrax fans will love\\". Chad Bowar from About.com named the album \\"certainly not essential\\", but assumed that the fans of the band will enjoy it. In a review for Metal Forces, Jim McDonald felt that the songs on Anthems were \\"perfect covers\\" with \\"superb melodies\\". Aside from \\"Jailbreak\\", which he pointed as the \\"sole low point\\", McDonald went on to say \\"all in all, Anthems is an interesting diversion while fans wait for the next album\\". Kory Grow from Revolver also made positive comments on the record, saying that Belladonna's voice \\"perfectly\\" fits the covers. Writing in PopMatters, reviewer J.C. Maçek stated that Anthrax delivered \\"the most accurate cover songs they possibly can\\". However, he noted that the band was \\"too careful\\" on this record, adding \\"nothing new\\" to it. Chris Ayers of Exclaim! was more enthusiastic towards the album, labeling it a \\"metal milestone\\" in Anthrax's \\"storied career\\".

A tower house stood on the site in 1510. In the 17th century the tower was replaced by a larger house: a lintel survives dated 1625 and bearing the initials MS for Mungo Stirling. The house was extensively rebuilt in the Scots Baronial style in 1869, though some 17th- century masonry remains. In 1879 a tower was added. The gardens were laid out in the first half of the 19th century.

The game is a sequel to Pushmo and was released in Japan on October 31, 2012, in Europe and Australia on November 15, 2012, and in North America on November 22, 2012. Two sequels, Pushmo World for the Wii U and Stretchmo for the Nintendo 3DS were released in 2014 and 2015 respectively.  Plot and setting  Crashmo is set in the titular Crashmo Park where numerous puzzles, the Crashmos, are set across the park. The park consists of four main areas, the park, which serves as the story mode; the sand castle where Papa Blox eplains the game's mechanics; the training area; and the Crashmo Studio, a pencil-shaped studio where Crashmos are created. The game starts when Mallo arrives at the Crashmo Park and encounters Poppy, Papa Blox's niece, in her \\"Bird Balloon\\" set with 100 birds. However, Mallo accidently scares all the birds who flies away across all over the park. Mallo then spends all the day saving the birds over the park; on evening, Mallo and Poppy departs aboard her Bird Balloon. The next day, Papa Blox presents to Mallo the Special Challenges; after finishing them, Papa Blox encourages the player to come back anytime and use the Crashmo Studio.  Gameplay  The gameplay is similar to its predecessor. The player controls Mallo as he jumps and interacts with the puzzles in order to climb it and reach the goal. However, the player can now control the camera to freely move around the puzzles. The puzzles also have gravity and puzzle pieces fall when there is no support.alt= By progressing, the player unlocks various other areas, such as the Crashmo Studio, where the player can create their own Crashmo and share it via QR codes. Reception Crashmo received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, with a score of 86,according to ratings aggregator Metacritic. Critics generally praised the graphics, music and gameplay, though its high difficulty for new players was criticized. Eurogamer's Christian Donlan rated the game an 8/10: \\"Fallblox is yet another Intelligent Systems game that seems to truly know its place in the world: it's happy to be a smart little download treat that comes alive for a few minutes every night before bed.\\" Edge Nathan Brown said of the game, \\"For tenacious players and those inclined towards the genre, Fallblox could prove an irresistible draw, with clearing its parade of cryptic conundrums a delicious prospect. For others, the game's difficulty, and its visual and thematic linearity, will prove tiresome, their enthusiasm for its self-evident ingenuity petering out before each of its challenges has fallen.\\" Audrey Drake of IGN described the game as \\"amazing\\" and a \\"must download\\" for 3DS owners. She was surprised to see Pushmo, a game she already held in high regard, improved. Drake had high praise for the \\"clever\\" gameplay, high difficulty, character and environment design, and camera controls. Her one criticism was that the high difficulty could scare off new players.

As a manager, he began his career with Bishop Auckland, before having two spells with Blyth Spartans and Whitby Town.  Background and playing career  Dunn was born in County Durham, raised in the village of East Howle before attending school in Durham. At the age of 12, Dunn was involved with the youth team of Burnley for four years, before joining Derby County's academy set-up. His debut with hometown club Bishop Auckland was in 1971, and he joined Scarborough in 1975 with whom he gained two FA Trophy winners medals, having scored in the 1977 final at Wembley against Dagenham. He made 265 appearances for Scarborough in all competitions, scoring 65 goals. He is sometimes confused with another long-standing Scarborough player also called Harry Dunn, who made over 900 appearances for the club and was already at the club before Dunn joined from Bishop Auckland. To avoid confusion, the new signing was given the fictitious middle initial \\"A\\" to differentiate between the two players. Therefore, to Scarborough fans he has always been known as Harry A. Dunn. It was the original Harry Dunn who managed Scarborough in 1982, and between 1984 and 1986, and was clubman of the year in 1970 and 1974, and not Harry A. Dunn as it is often reported. Dunn joined Blyth Spartans in 1981, winning a Northern League Championship medal, before rejoining Bishop Auckland in 1983.  Managerial career  From 1989 to 1993, he was manager of Bishop Auckland, until he left the club to join Phil Staley at Fleetwood Town. In 1995, he left to manage Blyth Spartans. However, he did not stay long at Croft Park as he was appointed as manager of Whitby Town in December 1995, staying in charge until his sacking in September 2004. He returned to Blyth the following month. On 8 November 2008, his Blyth Spartans side defeated League Two side Shrewsbury Town 3–1, in the first round of the FA Cup. They went on to defeat Bournemouth 1–0 in a second round replay at Croft Park, before losing 0–1 to Premier League club Blackburn Rovers on the same ground in round three, a game which Dunn refused to be moved to Newcastle United's St James' Park.Blyth Spartans turn down Newcastle ground as they look for FA Cup home banker Alongside his managerial duties for Blyth, Dunn worked in a caretaking capacity for a Durham nursing home. On 27 April 2009, Blyth confirmed that the club would not be renewing Dunn's contract. Dunn was re-appointed as manager of Whitby Town in May 2009, before resigning on 4 October 2010. He was appointed as chief scout at Darlington 1883 in June 2012. In October 2017, Dunn followed Martin Gray to York City as chief scout, and is also heading transfer policy and \\"assessment of forthcoming opponents\\".

A sequel, Velocity 2X, was released on September 2, 2014 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, and on August 19, 2015 for Steam and Xbox One. Gameplay Velocitys gameplay involves navigating the Quarp Jet – a teleporting spacecraft – through space, whilst avoiding and defeating enemies using bombs that can be flung in cardinal directions. The main goal of the game is to rescue stranded ships. The game adds depth by introducing new abilities and obstacles. The stranded ships are protected by shields that must be disabled by switches in a specific order. The player's ship has the ability to fire bombs. The game allows the player to teleport their ship anywhere. It also allows the player create telepods which they can return to anytime. The telepods add a puzzle element to the game because the player has to return to activate the switches in the right order. Plot Velocity is set in 2212. The star Vilio has collapsed into a black hole rendering the nearby space mining ships, colony cruisers, and special forces fighters without power. Only the Quarp Jet is capable of a rescue operation because it has the power to teleport. Unfortunately the mission is further complicated by the invasion of a neighboring race. Moreover, the ships can only be rescued after disabling their shields. The shields can only be disabled through circuit breakers. The circuit breakers are scattered, and must be deactivated in the correct order. In Velocity the player takes on the role of the Quarp Jet. They must find the station, disable their shields, and rescue the stranded ships. Concurrently they must also battle with the invading race, the Zetachron.http://www.velocitygame.co.uk/about.php?page=about Development Graphics for the PlayStation Mini version (left) and the native PlayStation Vita version (right) Velocity was developed by FuturLab, which is based in Brighton.http://www.futurlab.co.uk/history The idea for Velocity came from a musical tune composed by one of the game's creators James Marsden. The tune is featured in the critical urgency levels of the game. The game started development in June 2010. In August 2011 the main features and mechanics of the game were finalized. August 2011 was also when FuturLab signed a deal with PlayStation Plus that was essential to the game's completion. Velocity was mainly worked on by its creators: James Marsden, Robin Jubber and Kirsty Rigden. Additionally the creators also worked with sixteen freelance contractors, whose work on the game ranged from a few days to several months. Velocity Ultra Velocity Ultra is a high-definition remake of Velocity for the PlayStation Vita and was released on May 15, 2013. The remake includes numerous new features and upgrades and the graphics for Velocity Ultra have been completely remade to accommodate the high-definition resolution of the Vita. The art style has been reworked to be more consistent, and better match the upgraded graphics. Moreover, the remake includes Trophy support for the PlayStation Network. Furthermore, Velocity Ultra includes leaderboards; a global leaderboard, and a separate leaderboard for PlayStation Network friends. Additionally the game's user interface has been redesigned to support touch controls in addition to device buttons. Teleportation is possible simply by touching the screen, and bombs have been allocated to the right analog stick. The game is also available on PlayStation 3 and Steam. Reception Velocity has been met with positive reviews. Eurogamer's Rich Stanton rated the game an 8/10 saying, \\"Velocity looks like a blast from the past and plays like anything but; it's some sort of triumph of substance over style. That sounds like a good thing, and it is, but a little more of the latter wouldn't have hurt.\\" IGN adds \\"It's not the modest price that makes you love Velocity, though, it's the ideas – the casual, confident creativity and gradually unfolding scope of its levels\\". GameSpot gave Velocity a 7/10 noting that \\"initial parts of the game are repetitive\\". Sequel The sequel, titled Velocity 2X, was developed by FuturLab, published by Sierra Entertainment and released in September, 2014 on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, later ported to Microsoft Windows and Xbox One.

It serves the town of Proserpine. The station has one platform. Opposite lies a passing loop. History In 1908, a petition was signed by 306 ratepayers of the Bowen-Proserpine district, and presented to the Queensland Parliament pushing for the construction of a ‘tramway’ or ‘light railway’ to help open up the district for settlement. The agreement worked out between the two councils of Bowen and Proserpine, was to have a shared responsibility to build and operate the tramway. Construction was underway by the beginning of 1909. Prior to completion, there was a move to transfer construction out of the hands of the local authorities. However, the Government chose not to enter the argument, and the railway between Don (which was a mile from Bowen) and Proserpine opened to traffic on 11 July 1910. There was an official opening of sorts on 2 July 1910, when the Governor of Queensland, Sir William MacGregor was visiting the Proserpine Show. By all accounts, it was a happy event for all concerned. The first timetable had three trains a week running from Bowen. They took three hours to complete the journey. It was a reasonably rustic railway that greeted the ratepayers of the Bowen Proserpine Joint Tramway Board in 1909. A locomotive with an interesting, (if not ancient), railway pedigree was purchased to operate on the line. The locomotive was purchased from Queensland Railways’ Bowen Railway in 1909, at a princely sum of £600.00. A small ‘Mogul’ (2-6-0 wheel arrangement), built by the Baldwin locomotive company of Philadelphia had arrived in Queensland in 1879. Known firstly as GNR (Great Northern Railway) No. 1, it began life in Townsville. In 1884, it went north as a construction locomotive on the Cooktown Railway. After that it was back to Townsville. Then in 1890, it went to Bowen where it became No. 2 on the Bowen Railway. The little locomotive was described as being a ‘teakettle’, but, in its fussy little way did a good service for many years. In 1911 it was bought back by Queensland Railways, but it wasn’t until 1917 that the ‘tramway’ became a fully-fledged concern as part of the ‘bigger’ Queensland Railways. The tramway ‘officially’ opened on 11 July 1910 and was purchased by Queensland Railways on 1 July 1917 to become part of the North Coast Railway which was then under construction. The opening through to Proserpine, (officially) on 1 December 1923, linked Brisbane and Townsville.https://www.queenslandrail.com.au/ourhistory/station- storyboards/p-to-t Services Proserpine is served by Traveltrain's Spirit of Queensland service.

Description One marketing buzzword is iPaaS (integration platform as a service), for a suite of cloud services enabling customers to develop, execute and govern integration flows between disparate applications. Under the cloud-based iPaaS integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware. The iPaaS allows businesses to achieve integration without big investment into skills or licensed middleware software. iPaaS used to be regarded as an integration tool for cloud-based software applications, used mainly by small to mid-sized business. In the meantime, however, a hybrid type of iPaaS, i.e. Hybrid-IT iPaaS, that connects cloud to on-premises, is becoming increasingly popular. Additionally, large enterprises explore ways of integrating iPaaS into the existing IT estate. Cloud integration was basically created to break down the data silos, improve connectivity and optimize the business process. Cloud integration has increased its popularity as the usage of Software as a Service solutions is growing day by day. Prior to the emergence of cloud computing, integration could be categorized as either internal or business to business (B2B). Internal integration requirements were serviced through an on-premises middleware platform and typically utilized a service bus to manage exchange of data between systems. B2B integration was serviced through EDI gateways or value-added network (VAN). The advent of SaaS applications created a new kind of demand which was met through cloud-based integration. Since their emergence, many such services have also developed the capability to integrate legacy or on-premises applications, as well as function as EDI gateways. The following essential features were proposed by one marketing company: * Deployed on a multi-tenant, elastic cloud infrastructure * Subscription model pricing (operating expense, not capital expenditure) * No software development (required connectors should already be available) * Users do not perform deployment or manage the platform itself * Presence of integration management and monitoring features The emergence of this sector led to new cloud-based business process management tools that do not need to build integration layers - since those are now a separate service. Drivers of growth include the need to integrate mobile app capabilities with proliferating API publishing resources and the growth in demand for the Internet of things functionalities as more 'things' connect to the Internet.

Prior to the war Australia possessed only very limited air defences. However, by late-1942 an extensive anti- aircraft defence organisation had been developed, with anti-aircraft batteries in place around all the major cities as well as the key towns in northern Australia. A total of two Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) regiments, 32 static HAA batteries, 11 Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) regiments, 16 independent LAA batteries, three anti-aircraft training regiments and one anti-aircraft training battery were formed. These units were equipped with a range of weapon systems including 3.7 inch anti-aircraft guns and 40 mm Bofors guns. In addition six American anti-aircraft battalions were stationed in Australia, operating in Fremantle, Darwin, Townsville, and Brisbane. A number of anti- aircraft batteries were subsequently involved in dealing with the threat of Japanese air raids against northern Australia during 1942 and 1943, shooting down 29 enemy aircraft, probably destroying another 27 aircraft and damaging 32 between January 1942 and the end of 1943. Batteries in New Guinea also saw extensive action. However, as the war progressed and the threat from Japanese aircraft subsided, the manning of anti-aircraft defences in Australia was reduced to release manpower for other branches of the Army and for industry, and was increasingly taken over by Australian Women's Army Service or Volunteer Defence Corps personnel. Most batteries were disbanded between mid-1944 to late 1945.

Alfredo degli Uberti http://www.iagi.info/alfredodegliuberti.htm (1923-2007) served as the academy's pro-rector from 1980 till 2002. degli Uberti, a knight of several noted chivalric orders (Equestrian Order of the Saint Gregory the Great, The Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George and honorary member of the Accademia di Marina di Santo Stefano di Pisa) also served as vice-president of Kiwanis Club of Casale Monferrato (1978-1979). From 1981 to his death in 2015, the President of the Senato Accademico has been Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria, Head of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. From November 2015 Presidency has been taken over by H.R.H. Maria Teresa di Borbone Parma (1933-2020). From 2012 the pro-rector is Maria Loredana Pinotti. Today, the academy conducts numerous conferences as well as producing several scientific publications. In April of each year, the Academy holds an international meeting of leading Italian and corresponding scholars. Membership Election to the Academy is by nomination of three academicians and majority ballot. The Studium has less than 40 academicians of which several are Nobel Prize laureates.

Overview The main purpose of luit is to allow \\"legacy\\" applications that use character sets other than UTF-8 to work with contemporary terminal emulators. luit may be required today when connecting to a \\"legacy\\" host that only supports an older encoding, such as ISO 8859-1. For example, instead of running \\"\`ssh legacy-machine\`\\", a user may have to run \\"\\" to properly render French accented characters on a UTF-8 terminal. luit is also used to properly render the output of applications that use ISO 2022 character set switching. ISO 2022 is an older standard that allowed an application to \\"switch\\" between different fonts, e.g., to mix line- drawing characters with text or to display text in multiple languages and character sets. UTF-8 itself does not support switching fonts; the encoding is stateless and gives each unique character (including line-drawing characters) its own numerical encoding. It can be used to translate between these two encodings. Examples of programs that require translation to run correctly on a UTF-8 terminal include earlier versions of emacs/MULE, and programs that use ISO 2022 shift sequences in ANSI escape codes that switch to an alternate character set in order to draw line-drawing characters. luit is invoked automatically by xterm when necessary to translate program output into UTF-8, for programs running on a local computer. When connecting remotely to another computer, the user must run luit directly. luit interprets application output according to the locale's character set with ISO 2022 shifts and ECMA-48 escape sequences. If an application is speaking a different language than the locale's character set (one that may have matched the terminal emulator's expectations in the absence of luit), luit can misinterpret the application's output and produce corrupted output to the terminal.\\"luit notes\\" History luit was written in 2001 by Juliusz Chroboczek,\\"luit author website\\" when major Linux distributions began migrating to the Unicode character set from \\"legacy\\" encodings such as ISO 8859-1.\\"UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ for Unix/Linux\\" It has since become a widely installed base utility, present on more than half of all Linux computer systems by some estimates.\\"x11-utils Debian popularity contest results\\"\\"Ubuntu popularity contest results\\" It is also part of IBM's AIX.AIX 7.1 manual Implementations There are two versions of luit: one maintained by Thomas Dickey\\"luit home page\\" as part of xterm, and another by Freedesktop.org.\\"Xorg luit home page\\" Linux distributions generally ship the latter version\\"Freedesktop mailing list discussion, 'luit forked?', April 2009 as part of their X11 utilities package. However, while migrating to GitLab, the latter fork was discontinued because it was unmaintained.
