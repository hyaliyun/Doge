She is Vice President and Regional Director for Africa at the World Resources Institute, based in Nairobi, Kenya. In this role, she takes on global issues including deforestation and energy access. She was selected as one of the 100 Most Influential Africans by New African Magazine in 2018 for her role serving as the senior advisor at the World Resources Institute as well as for her recent campaign to plant over 30 million trees through her work at the Green Belt Movement.  Early life and education  Mathai was born and raised in Kenya. Her mother, Wangari Maathai, was a social, environmental and political activist and the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, in 2004. Mathai was a student at State House Girls' High School in Nairobi. After completing high school she moved to New York City to attend Hobart and William Smith College where she majored in biology and graduated in 1994. She received a Masters in Public Health and in Business Administration from Emory University. After graduating Mathai joined the Carter Center where she worked on disease control. Here she learned about diseases that impacted African communities such as dracunculiasis, onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis.  Research and career  = The Green Belt Movement = Mathai serves on the World Future Council and on the board of the Green Belt Movement. The Green Belt Movement was founded by Wanjira's mother Wangari in 1977. Originally, Mathai served as Director of International of Affairs of the Green Belt Movement from 2002 and later was made Executive Director of the organization. At this organization she led fundraising programs and monitored resource mobilization, as well as facilitated international outreach. She realized that women were more responsive when the Green Belt Movement called for people to help planting trees. She has said that her work in planting trees, also called agroforestry, was inspired by her mother's environmental work. After her mother won the Nobel Peace Prize, Mathai accompanied her on a world tour. When her mother passed away in 2011, she helped steer the club through a time of transition. = Other Organizations and Foundations = Wanjira Mathai talking as Director of the Wangari Maathai Institute Mathai serves as senior advisor of the Partnerships for Women Entrepreneurs in Renewables (wPOWER). wPOWER promotes women in renewable energy leadership in an effort to bring renewables to almost four million women in East Africa. To Mathai, women's engagement with renewable energy is one of economic empowerment, fulfilling several of the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite the modernization occurring in Kenya, women still spend several hours a day collecting firewood, and half of all deaths in children under 5 years old occur due to household air pollution. Mathai serves on the advisory board of the Clean Cooking Alliance, and is also a member of the Earth Chapter International Council. She also serves on the Board of Trustees of the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). She is also one of a few six second EQ practitioners. These practitioners seek to promote emotional intelligence and support others to create a culture of positivity. Since 2016, Mathai has served as Chair person of the Wangari Maathai Foundation. The foundation looks to advance the legacy of Wangari Maathai by promoting a culture of purpose with young people serving as leaders. When asked of her work with the foundation, Mathai responded \\"I am not living in my mother‚Äôs Shadow, I am basking in her light...\\". The foundation has three priorities: maintaining Wangari Muta Maathai House, instilling leadership skills in youth to promote creativity and courage at a young age (Wanakesho), and a fellowship for young people. As an illustration of her faith in the importance of educating youth, she was the project director for the Wangari Maathai Institute for Peace and Environmental Studies at the University of Nairobi (WMI). This institute focuses on promoting positive ethics and sustainable development. Educating youth has always been one of Maathai's goals, and she states, \\"Human beings are not born corrupt. At some point these behaviors are fostered by a culture that promotes individual gain over collective progress.\\" She believes that educating youth will allow for peace-building and for a decrease in corruption in Kenya, as youth will grow up to become future leaders. She often speaks to these topics, as she is a motivational speaker on the topics of youth leadership, environment, and climate change. In addition, Mathai sits on the board of The World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) in Kenya. In 2018 Mathai was selected as one of the 100 Most Influential Africans by New African Magazine, as well as the Top Influential African Women by the African Leadership University. As of December 2019 Mathai has served as Vice President and Regional Director for Africa at World Resources Institute. In this capacity Mathai convinced the Kenyan Environment Minister Judi Wakhungu to commit to restoring 12.6 million acres of deforested land in Kenya by 2030, building on her mother's environmental activism legacy. This is part of the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100), which Mathai oversees, an initiative to restore over 100 million hectares of deforested land in Africa by 2030.

Sprague de Camp. It was first published under the variant title \\"Cornzan, the Mighty\\" in the magazine Future Science Fiction for December, 1955. All later appearances omit the comma.Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983. It first appeared in book form in the collection A Gun for Dinosaur and Other Imaginative Tales (Doubleday, 1963). The story has been translated into German. Plot summary Protagonist Franklin Hahn is scriptwriter for the television-moumpicture serial \\"Cornzan the Mighty,\\" mingling and spoofing elements from Edgar Rice Burroughs's Tarzan and Barsoom series, Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian, and Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon. Hahn is smitten with fickle actress Cassia MacDermott, female lead on the show. She has just turned down his latest marriage proposal. The production also faces other difficulties. Everyone is kept on edge by temperamental program manager Mortimer Knight, self-proclaimed genius, who treats all his subordinates like slaves. Only Hahn stands up to him. If that's not enough, the studio is trying out the new consiline-hypnosis treatment, which conditions the actors to believe they really are the characters they portray. And Sasha, a giant anaconda grown to one hundred feet in length with hormones, has been brought in to provide the menace for the current episode. He's supposed to have drugged into docility, but working with wild animals is always chancy. Scientist Ilya Sorokin, discoverer of consiline, is responsible for both the treatment and the snake. In the dispensary, Cassia and her co-star Remington Dallas, who plays Cornzan, receive their consiline doses and indoctrination tapes. Series director Eisenhower Lynd tries to keep things light by telling limericks, which Knight later tries to top, drawing a rebuke from Sorokin lest it spoil the actors' indoctrination. They quarrel, Knight threatening to sack Sorokin as soon as the current series if concluded, and the later rejoining he can put the whole studio out of business with his new drug, somnone-beta, that will indoctrinate audiences with scripts from which they can dream their own adventures. On that note, shooting starts. The Cornzan series is set on a fictional \\"Counter- Earth\\" called Anthon; the titular hero, son of earthly scientist John Carson, was orphaned when his parents' spaceship crashed and was raised by native tree-men. In maturity he became a mercenary in the service of the tyrannical King Djurk of Djelibin and fell in love with the king's daughter Lululu, thus incurring the king's wrath. Now he must rescue his love from the jungle temple of Yak, guarded by the giant snake. The actors playing King Djurk and his henchman Boger tie up Lululu (Cassia) in the temple set as bait to lure rescuing hero Cornzan into the jaws of the snake. The princess dutifully screams as Sasha appears, and Cornzan swings in to save her. They kiss and emote, and then Cornzan incongruously starts spouting lines from Macbeth (Dallas was a Shakespearian actor before landing his current role). The indoctrination was ruined, all right! Evidently, the verses he was hearing did it. As the action proceeds, more and more Macbeth dialog gets interspersed with Cornzan's scripted lines. Shooting will have to cease and the actors given the antidote. But it must be done in keeping with their dream reality, lest their minds be damaged. \\"Djurk\\" and \\"Boger\\" having already left for the day, Knight drafts Hahn and Sorokin into their roles to dose Cassia and Dallas. It doesn't go well. \\"Cornzan,\\" believing Hahn to be Djurk, engages him in swordplay; to prevent the actor from killing Hahn, Sorokin beans him with the device to administer the antidote. Distracted, Dallas pursues Sorokin, and Hahn pursues both. Each vaults over the giant snake Sasha, and Dallas, stumbling, accidentally stabs it. Hahn knocks Dallas out, only to face an angry Sasha. Knight, shouting \\"If he eats our star it'll ruin the show!\\" bounds forward; he and Hahn both try to pull Dallas away, but tug in opposite directions. Sasha clamps down on Knight and drags him back screaming. Hahn goes after Sasha with Dallas's sword. Eventually he succeeds in piercing the snake's skull, and it destroys the set in its dying convulsions. Afterwards, Knight, unfairly blaming Hahn for everything, fires him. Putting their heads together, Hahn and Sorokin realize Knight had already tried to kill them both; Sorokin had thrown the antidote device because he had discovered it emptythe manager had set them up to be killed by the hypnotized Dallas. They can't prove it, though. Feeling Hahn has been fired partly on his account, Sorokin takes him on as a business partner. A month later, the two are rich; to stay in business, the studio is paying them through the nose to suppress Sorokin's patent on the somnone-beta process. Things are also looking up for Hahn personally. Cassia had thrown Hahn over for Dallas in the wake of the disaster, but found him all looks and no intellect. Now she wants Hahn back. Hahn, still smitten and no wiser, blissfully accepts. Reception P. Schuyler Miller, commenting on the stories in the collection A Gun for Dinosaur, called this piece \\"a low comedy of the future entertainment world, [in which] Conan, Tarzan, Flash Gordon and Jungle Jim are properly demolished.\\"Miller, P.

It is a green-brown solid and its crystal structure was determined first in 1982.  Structure  The structure of Ni(SCN)2 was determined via single-crystal X-ray diffraction and consists of two-dimensional sheets held together through Van der Waals forces. It belongs to mercury thiocyanate structure-type and can be considered a distorted form of the NiBr2 (CdI2) structure. Each nickel is octahedrally coordinated by four sulfurs and two nitrogens. The sulfur end of the SCN- ligand is doubly bridging.  Synthesis  Nickel(II) thiocyanate can be prepared using salt metathesis using the reaction of methanolic solutions of KSCN and nickel(II) perchlorate hexahydrate, filtering off the precipitated KClO4 to yield a solution of Ni(SCN)2. On removal of methanol a pure microcrystalline powder of Ni(SCN)2 can be obtained.

Publication history Shannon Appelcline, in the 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '80s, noted that after West End Games published a second edition of the Star Wars role-playing game in 1992, \\"The Star Wars line was even enjoying something of a renaissance, with some innovative material going to press, notably the DarkStryder Campaign (1996), which took a darker look at the Star Wars universe.\\" The Darkstryder Campaign is a boxed set that was designed by Peter Schweighofer, Doug Shuler, Bill Smith, Eric Trautmann, Timothy Zahn, Daniel Scott Palter, Richard Hawran, Stephen Crane, Paul Sudlow, Pablo Hidalgo, and Miranda Horner, with illustrations by Tim Bobko, David Day, Terry Pavlet, Brian Schomburg, Philip Tan, David Deltrick, Christopher Moeller, Doug Shuler, and Mike Vilardi. The boxed set consists of * 96-page softcover Campaign Book (describes in detail the starship FarStar and its crew) * 96-page softcover Adventure Book (includes an overview of the Kathol Sector, and six sequentially linked adventures) * 52 character and ship cards * a 22‚Äô x 34‚Äô double-sided poster map Plot Imperial warlord Moff Sarne has set about to conquer a large part of the galaxy. The players take on the roles of characters who board the decrepit starship FarStar and attempt to track him down. Gameplay Players are encouraged to play several pregenerated characters at the same time. Reception In the June 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue #230), Rick Swan called this set of adventures \\"one of the most dramatic turning popints in the game's history [...] Forget your cuddly Ewoks, your bumbling droids, your kiddie show aliens. DarkStryder conjures a harsher, drearier universe, a Star Wars for grown-ups.\\" Swan was intrigued by this new darker tone, saying, \\"The campaign features villains who murder, allies who backstab, and heroes who die. A haze of despair hangs over DarkStryder, which is both intriguing and disturbing. It‚Äôs like visiting Oz and finding alcoholic Munchkins.\\" He called the illustrated cards of notable personalities \\"a nice touch, useful for players and gamemasters alike.\\" He thought the linked adventures were \\"well-staged and easy-to-run adventures, offering a satisfying blend of action, problem-solving, and role-playing.\\" However, Swan was troubled that the campaign \\"doesn't really go anywhere; it's all set-up and no climax.\\" He concluded by giving the boxed set an average score of 4 out of 6, saying, \\"With its unresolved plot lines and unanswered questions, it feels incomplete. The designers still seem to be groping for a style, as if they‚Äôre not quite sure how far they can go. Consequently, DarkStryder doesn't plunge Star Wars into darkness; it merely draws the shades a bit. Next time, I hope they throw caution to the wind really go for the grit. For now, DarkStryder stands as a promising beginning, a rich, involving expansion that opens up an RPG on the verge of rusting shut.\\" References Category:Science fiction role-playing game adventures Category:Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game ","title":"The Darkstryder Campaign"},{"id":"62678479","text":"Randy Komisar is a technology attorney, executive, and author living in Silicon Valley, California.

AD 431) was a late Roman religious patron, correspondent of St Augustine and was the mother of Melania the Younger.  Biography  Albina was born in Nola, possibly during the AD 360s based on the known date of birth of her daughter Melania in 383. She was from a wealthy Roman family: her father was Ceionius Rufius Albinus and her brother was Rufius Antonius Agrypnius. Her aunt was Avita, mother of Eunomia. She married to Valerius Publicola and had a daughter who became the Christian Saint and Desert Mother, Melania the Younger. Melania married her cousin Valerius Pinianus c.396. Albina went with Melania and Pinnanius to Campania and Sicily after Publicola's death prior to 408. In c.410 the family moved to near Thagaste, where they stayed for seven years. In c.417 Albina accompanied Melania to Palestine and remained there until her death fourteen years later, c.431.  Religious Politics  It's clear from surviving correspondence that Albina was seen as an influential woman in her own right, beyond association with her daughter. = Correspondence with Augustine of Hippo = Her most notable correspondence was with Augustine of Hippo, to whom she wrote over sixty-nine letters. In his first letter to Albina, her daughter and son-in-law, Augustine regrets that he cannot travel to see them and misses their \\"vehement light\\". It's clear that Albina is an important part of the religious network in the early fifth century, as she is mentioned in letters, such as Letter 125 from Augustine to Alypius. Albina alone was addressed by Augustine in Letter 126, which reports on the aftermath of the incident at Thagaste, which is now known as the Pinian Affair.  Pinian Affair  Albina was involved in an incident, whilst they were in Thagaste. Albina wrote to Augustine asking him to visit them, but he would not leave his church. As a result, Albina, Melania and Pinnianus travelled to him. Once there, the congregation demanded that Pinnianus be ordained and the congregation became frenzied. Augustine threatened that he would leave as bishop. The episode shows how volatile communities could be.  Pelagian Heresy  Augustine wrote addressed the letter refuting Pelagianism to Albina and her family. Historian Peter Brown suggested that one of the reasons Augustine delayed attacking Pelagius until c.415 was because of the closeness of Albina and her family with him. = Friendship with Paulinus of Nola = Albina was discussed by Paulinus of Nola, in Poem 21, dating to c.407. He describes her as a leader of \\"the column of the singing chorus\\" with her aunt, Avita, and his wife Therasia. = Correspondence with Jerome = Jerome dedicated his book De Gratia Christi et de Peccato Originali to her, Melania and Pinianus. He also wrote to Augustine and Aypius in 419 in Letter 202, discussing various church matters and sending greetings to the leader from Albina.

Major tournaments began in 2001 with the first major at the Cyberathlete Professional League Winter Championship, won by Ninjas in Pyjamas. History Counter-Strike has over 20 years of competitive history beginning with the original Counter-Strike. Tournaments for game series have been hosted since 2000. The first major international tournament was hosted in Dallas, Texas at the 2001 Cyberathlete Professional League Winter Championship, won by the Swedish team Ninjas in Pyjamas. The tournament offered a $150,000 prize pool. 2001 Winter CPL Counter-Strike tournament In 2002, Korea‚Äôs World Cyber Games joined the competitive scene of Counter-Strike, followed by France's Electronic Sports World Cup in 2003. These along with the bi-annual CPL tournaments were the dominate majors of Counter-Strike esports through 2007 and featured strong rivalries among top- level teams. CPL ceased operation in 2008. Another league, ESL, then added Counter-Strike to its Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) series. These tournaments continued for four years. The final major update to Counter-Strike was the 1.6 version in 2003, which became known as Counter-Strike 1.6 (CS 1.6). The years of 2002-07 are considered Counter-Strike's first Golden Age, as the game's popularity and market-share eclipsed all others in the fledgling Esports industry. Valve had struggled to iterate on CS 1.6 because of its high skill ceiling and elegant gameplay. The Counter-Strike Xbox release had limited success as compared to that of Halo and Call of Duty. The first official sequel was Counter-Strike: Source (CS:S), released on November 1, 2004. The game was criticized by the competitive community, who believed the game's skill ceiling was significantly lower than that of CS 1.6. This caused a divide in the competitive community as to which game to play competitively. Valve, sponsors, and tournament organizers were advocating for the newer CS:S to be played at tournaments, but the large majority of professional CS players refused to play it due to its perceived shortcomings. Counter-Strike fell into esports obscurity during the late 2000s and early 2010s. This was in part due to the fractured competitive scene, but also due to the newcomer MOBA genre overcoming Counter-Strike's previous stranglehold on the team-based esport market. The release of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) in 2012 reunited the competitive community of Counter-Strike, ushering in a new era of esports relevance for the franchise. Initially, the game was criticized for imbalanced gameplay, poor mechanics and bugs. However, within several months the gameplay improved after updates from Valve. The advent of video game streaming services such as UStream, Justin.tv and Twitch increased the popularity of competitive Counter-Strike. On September 16, 2013, Valve announced a US$250,000 community-funded prize pool for its first CS:GO Major Championship; the money was funded through the Arms Deal Update, which offers players in-game cosmetics. Valve also announced that the first Major, known as DreamHack Winter 2013, would take place in Sweden. The Valve-sponsored Majors would go on to be the most important and prestigious tournaments in the Global Offensive esports scene. In October 2015, a number of professional esports organizations with Counter-Strike teams announced the formation of a trade union that set several demands for future tournament attendance. The announcement was a publicly posted email written by Alexander Kokhanovsky, CEO of Natus Vincere, that was sent to organizers of major esports events. Teams that were part of the union included Natus Vincere, Team Liquid, Counter Logic Gaming, Cloud9, Virtus.pro, Team SoloMid, Fnatic, Ninjas in Pyjamas, Titan and Team EnVyUs. Teams in this union would not attend Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournaments with prize pools of less than $75,000. In 2016, the World eSports Association (WESA) was founded by ESL with many esports teams, including Fnatic, Natus Vincere, Team EnVyUs and FaZe Clan, though FaZe Clan left soon after the league's formation. In its announcement, WESA said it would \\"further professionalize eSports by introducing elements of player representation, standardized regulations, and revenue sharing for teams\\". They also planned to help fans and organizers by \\"seeking to create predictable schedules.\\" Valve's decisions have a strong influence on the competitive metagame. Decisions such as the removal of maps and inclusions of new ones are sometimes met with criticism. In 2016, Valve was \\"heavily criticized\\" for the removal of the map Inferno and its replacement, Nuke, in the competitive map pool. The release of CS 1.6 in 2003 saw a contentious nerf of the iconic AWP sniper rifle by increasing its drawtime. This significantly reduced the ability of a player armed with an AWP to simultaneously engage multiple targets. The AWP was again the subject of a controversial nerf in 2015 when players' movement speed and acceleration was decreased while the weapon was equipped. Valve has also implemented new coaching rules restricting the ability of communication between coaches and players during a match, and altered a 15-year precedent by increasing the duration of each round and bomb timer in 2015. By 2014, 25 million copies of the Counter-Strike series were sold. The game's fan base remains strong. Media coverage As the game and the scene grew in popularity, companies, including WME/IMG and Turner Broadcasting, began to televise Global Offensive professional games, with the first being ELEAGUE Major 2017, held at the Fox Theatre and broadcast on US cable television network TBS in 2016. On August 22, 2018, Turner announced its further programming of Global Offensive with ELEAGUE‚Äôs Esports 101: CSGO and ELEAGUE CS:GO Premier 2018's docuseries on TBS. Controversies =Cheating= Cheating, particularly through the use of software hacks on online servers, has been a problem throughout the history of Counter-Strike and generally results in a game ban if discovered. A Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) ban is the most common way in which players are banned. VAC is a system designed by Valve to detect cheats on computers. Any time a player connects to a VAC-secured server and a cheat is detected, the user is kicked from the server, given a permanent lifetime ban and barred from playing on any VAC- secured servers. Professional players play online on independent platform servers hosted by leagues such as ESEA or Faceit, which have proprietary anti- cheat programs. Linus \\"b0bbzki\\" Lundqvist was the first known professional player to be banned in Global Offensive. Hovik \\"KQLY\\" Tovmassian was one of the highest-profile players to be issued a VAC ban. KQLY was banned, along with several other professional players, such as Gordon \\"Sf\\" Giry, while KQLY was playing for France's best team, Titan. Vinicius ‚Äúv$m‚Äù Moreira from Brazil was VAC-banned while he was playing for Detona Gaming. Cheating has also occurred at LAN tournaments, and players who cheat at organized tournaments may receive permanent bans or may be dismissed from their team. In 2018, at the eXTREMESLAND ZOWIE Asia CS:GO, Nikhil \\"forsaken\\" Kumawat of OpTic India was caught cheating mid-match using aimbot during a tournament game against Revolution, a Vietnamese Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team. The tournament had a $100,000 prize pool. OpTic India was disqualified and Kumawat was dismissed from the team. =Match fixing= Players have also been banned for match fixing. In August 2014, two CS:GO teams, iBUYPOWER and NetcodeGuides.com, were involved in a match-fixing scandal that has been cited as \\"the first large match fixing scandal\\" in the CS:GO community. iBUYPOWER, who was heavily favored to win, lost in a resounding 16-to-4 defeat to NetcodeGuides.com. It was later discovered in a tip to Dot Esports that the match was fixed. =Gambling= Following the introduction of the Arms Deal update in August 2013, weapon \\"skins\\" formed a virtual economy because of their rarity and other high-value factors that influenced their desirability. Because of this, a number of skin-trading and gambling sites enabled by the Steamworks API were created. Initially, these sites focused solely on wagering skins on the outcomes of professional and semi-professional CS:GO matches in the vein of sports betting. However, some of these sites began to offer casino gambling functionality in 2015, allowing users to gamble their skins on the outcome of roulette spins, coin flips, dice rolls, and other games of chance. In 2016, esports players wagered nearly $5 billion in CS:GO skins. In June and July of that year, two formal lawsuits were filed against these gambling sites and Valve, stating that they encourage underage gambling and undisclosed promotion by some streamers. Valve began to take steps to prevent these sites from using Steamworks for gambling purposes, and several of the sites ceased operating as a result. In July 2018, Valve disabled the opening of containers in Belgium and the Netherlands after its loot boxes appeared to violate Dutch and Belgium gambling laws. However, some parties have tried to contest Valve's gambling rules. Various forms of gambling have emerged over time in addition to skin betting, including case openings, coin flipping, CS:GO roulettes, CS:GO casinos, and match betting. Some of these forms of gambling have also been subject to law suits.

Gluck's organization, the Santa Claus Association, would receive letters addressed to Santa Claus from impoverished children, investigate them to ensure that they were truly needy, and if approved would send gifts to those children.  Early life  Gluck, the oldest of five brothers, was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York and raised in Westfield, New Jersey. Gluck, who was born on Christmas Day, descended from a line of Santa Claus players, including his grandfather, Johan Baptiste von Gluck who played Santa Claus in Baltimore, Maryland. He inherited his father's customs brokerage business but left the business at age 35.  The Santa Claus Association  The Santa Claus Association, which was founded in December 1913, arose as a result of a policy change by the United States Postal Service. Prior to 1911, the Post Office destroyed letters sent addressed to Santa Claus. In 1911, the local postmasters began giving the letters to charity groups in their area instead. In New York City, there were no charity groups willing to participate in this program. Gluck contacted Edward M. Morgan, then Postmaster of New York City, with a proposal to set up a not-for- profit organization (the Santa Claus Association), which would receive, verify, and respond to Christmas letters sent by needy children in New York. Gluck, who was born on Christmas Day, was seen as a natural choice for the role. The Santa Claus Association essentially served as a middleman between donors and children. Volunteers would spend their time reading and organizing letters while donors (often wealthy businesspersons or other members of the social elite) would fund the gift-giving operations. Gluck himself served as President of the association, and he named John J. Kiely as the honorary vice- president. The organization quickly grew large, receiving thousands of dollars in donations to pay for supplies, postage, and gifts for needy children. It also collaborated extensively with major politicians like New York Governor Al Smith and United States President Warren Harding as well as celebrities like Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. As funds poured in, Gluck's ambitions grew. In 1915, three years after the Association started operating, Gluck announced a plan to build a massive structure called the Santa Claus Building on a 100-foot-wide plot in the middle of New York City. Though Gluck aggressively fundraised to raise the $300,000 needed to build the project, and even commissioned famous architects George and Edward Blum to design the building, no work was ever done. = Downfall = The Santa Claus Association became embroiled in controversy as a result of dubious fundraising and accounting practices. Bird S. Coler, then the commissioner for public welfare in New York City, investigated the organization in 1927. Coler uncovered tens of thousands of dollars in unaccounted-for funds as well as a lack of institutional oversight over Gluck's use of donors' funds. Coler's audit revealed that almost all of the money raised for the Santa Claus Building had been embezzled by Gluck himself, who had also embezzled most of the funds raised to purchase gifts and pay for postage. The United States Post Office ended its involvement with the Santa Claus Association and eventually developed its own letter-answering service under the auspices of Operation Santa Claus.  Later life and death  Gluck was never charged with a crime for his activities with the Santa Claus Association. After the collapse of the Association, he and his wife moved to Miami, Florida where he became a real estate agent. He remained there until 1951, where he died at the age of 73.

It is endemic to southern Brazil and is only known from its type locality, Serra da Pedra Branca do Araraquara in Guaratuba, Paran√°. The specific name insperatus means \\"unexpected\\" or \\"surprising\\" in Latin and alludes to the fortuitous finding of a new species among old museum specimens, originally identified as Physalaemus olfersii; taxonomically, it is part of the so-called Physalameus olfersii species group. Description Based on the type series consisting of four adult males and two adult females, males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is robust. The head is longer than it is wide. The snout is subelliptical in dorsal view and protruding in lateral view. The tympanum and the supratympanic fold are distinct. The canthus rostralis is distinct and the eyes are slightly protuberant. The arms are short and slender, and the fingers are very thin and long and with slightly expanded tips. The legs are moderately robust. The toes are very thin, long, and weakly fringed. Skin is smooth. Preserved specimens are dorsally light brown with scattered brown dots. A middorsal fold is well marked on the sacral region with light brown color. A brown line runs from the tip of snout to the eye and brown stripe on the flank. There are dispersed brown dots on the loreal region. Males have a well-developed vocal sac. Habitat and conservation The species occurs in Atlantic Forest, but there is no specific information on its microhabitat or ecology. The type series was collected in 1951 from Guaratuba Environmental Protection Area.

He was a strong advocate of metal construction, and his airliners were important in the development of French commercial aviation in the 1930s. He is especially known for his invention of vectored thrust for aircraft, which led to the development of the V/STOL Hawker Siddeley Harrier. Early life Michel Wibault was born in Douai, near Lille, France on 5 June 1897 to Achille and Madelaine Wibault. Achille owned a chain of about a hundred grocery shops. They had three sons and three daughters. At the age of four, Michel was disabled by polio affecting all his limbs. As a result, he did not attend school, and was entirely home- and self-educated. He also had a German nanny. His disability precluded him from military service. During his childhood he often visited La Brayelle Airfield, where the world's first aviation meeting took place. It was home to the workshops of Louis Breguet whom he met and with whom he later formed a lasting acquaintance. In August 1914 Douai was captured by the Germans, and German officers occupied the family mansion. Michel made visits to the occupied La Brayelle airfield. The Germans took little notice of the disabled young man and, understanding German, he was able to observe the activities and take extensive notes. He also met Anthony Fokker, who was staying with family friends while demonstrating his designs to the Germans. Michel built his own wind tunnel for testing models. Disliking the Germans, he was able to move to Belgium and then to Switzerland where he developed his ideas. Aircraft development In March 1917 Wibault presented a fighter design to Lieutenant-Colonel √âmile Dorand, Director of the Technical Section of Military Aeronautics (STA√©) in Paris, and with financial assistance from his maternal uncle, made in December 1917, built a model which was successfully tested in the Eiffel aerodynamic laboratory. With French engineer Paul Boccaccio, in 1918 he designed and built his first aeroplane, the Wibault-Boccaccio & Cie C.1 fighter powered by a 220hp Hispano-Suiza engine. Tests were very successful, achieving a top speed of 237km/h and an altitude of 7,500m, but development was abandoned at the end of the war. The company's first aircraft, the Wibault 2 night bomber - only one built In 1919 Wibault founded Soci√©t√© des Avions Michel Wibault at Billancourt, with various aircraft, mostly parasol monoplanes of Duralumin construction, flying from 1920. At first the aircraft were all military types, with Wibault turning to civil transports from 1930. Wibault became a consulting engineer for Vickers, starting in 1922. As a pioneer of metal construction for which he held patents, he closely followed the design methods of Hugo Junkers and Caudius Dornier. Wibault and Vickers jointly developed more metal construction patents. By 1925 Vickers had adopted Wibault‚Äôs construction methods, and produced the Vickers Wibault Scout (based on the Wibault 7) - 26 of which were bought by the Chilean Air Force - the Vickers Vireo and Jockey fighters, and the Viastra, Vellore and Vellox civil transports. Wibault-Penho√´t 281T F-ADEK, the prototype 280T with Hispano- Wright engines replaced by Gnome-Rh√¥nes In 1930 French shipbuilders Penho√´t (Chantiers St. Nazaire) funded construction of the Wibault-Penho√´t 280-T low- wing trimotor transport. This was the first of a series of airliners that was vitally important to the development of commercial aviation in France in the 1930s. The collaboration was successful, with Penho√´t merging with Wibault in 1931, forming the Chantiers Aeronautiques Wibault-Penho√´t. Then in 1934 Wibault-Penho√´t itself was sold to Breguet, which went on to produce several Wibault designs. In 1937 the French Air Ministry awarded Wibault a contract for a large four-engined double-deck airliner carrying up to 72 passengers. An early version, carrying 25 passengers in some luxury, including a lower deck bar and restaurant was named the Air-Wibault 1.00. The prototype was completed, but only three engines could be obtained, and it was destroyed in an air raid on the Arsenal works at Villacoublay on 3 June 1940. It is said that Wibault himself set fire to it to stop it falling into German hands. On 17 June 1940 Wibault escaped with his wife Marie-Rose from Paris to London where Charles de Gaulle appointed him as technical director of France Forever, a support organisation for de Gaulle in the USA. Moving to America, Wibault joined Republic Aviation where he worked with the company‚Äôs major driving force and chief designer Alexander Kartveli. Kartveli, a Soviet √©migr√©, had trained at an aviation school in Paris and then worked for Louis Bleriot, and for the Wibault company, leaving for America in 1927, and was a strong proponent of metal construction methods. For Republic, Wibault worked on the design of the XF-12 Rainbow, and the RC-3 Seabee. VTOL development While in New York in 1940, Wibault met Winthrop Rockefeller, the billionaire politician and philanthropist, who was to finance Wibault for the rest of his career, mainly through an entity called the Vibrane Corporation which supported him and sponsored his US patent applications. After the war, Wibault divided his time between New York and Paris. He became increasingly interested in vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, with projects ranging from interceptors to large airliners, most of which he classified as a ‚ÄúGyropter‚Äù (French ‚Äì ‚ÄúGyropt√®re‚Äù). His starting point was a circular aircraft comparable to the Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar. The first prototype Hawker P.1127 XP831 which made its first vertical take-off on 21 October 1960, over two years before Wibault's death In 1954, one of his projects was for a vertical take-off and landing ground-attack Gyropter using the most powerful turboshaft engine then available, a Bristol Orion, driving four centrifugal compressors mounted on the sides of the airframe around the centre of gravity. The compressor outlet nozzles were able to swivel between pointing straight down for take-off and landing, and pointing horizontally backwards for forward flight. He obtained patents for his vectored thrust design. Unable to interest the French government or industry in the idea, in 1955 Wibault submitted it to the NATO Mutual Weapons Development Programme and was subsequently introduced to Stanley Hooker who was then technical director of Bristol Engines. Soon Wibault agreed to work with Bristol, and they worked to lighten and simplify the engine design, leading to a new patent in 1957, jointly authored by Michel Wibault and Hooker‚Äôs assistant, Gordon Lewis. Meanwhile, Hawker‚Äôs chief designer Sidney Camm, noting the success of the Ryan X-13 Vertijet, had developed an interest in VTOL aircraft, which he expressed in a letter to Hooker, and thus the scene was set for the development of the Bristol Siddeley Pegasus engine. This was at the heart of the Hawker P.1127 design that evolved into the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. Personal life In March 1930 he married Marie-Rose Boistel. In 1931 he was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He died in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 23 January 1963.

North Korea expert Andrei Lankov has said that North Korea's real growth rate is 3‚Äì4%.  Foreign encouragement  Economic reforms in North Korea has been encouraged by China. While visiting Pyongyang in June 2019, Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping said that Kim Jong-un had ‚Äúinitiated a new strategic line of economic development and improving people‚Äôs livelihoods, raising socialist construction in the country to a new high tide.‚Äù  See also  * Chinese economic reform  References  Category:Economy of North Korea Category:Economic liberalization ","title":"North Korean economic reform"},{"id":"62678864","text":"Thomas Knox (born 5 September 1939) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played in the Football League for Chelsea, Mansfield Town, Newcastle United and Northampton Town.

Description In 1989, Games Workshop released the two-player board game Space Hulk, in which one player takes the role of Space Marine Terminators, superhuman elite soldiers who have been sent to investigate a wrecked spaceship drifting in interstellar space; the other player takes the role of Tyranid Genestealers, an aggressive alien species that have made their home aboard the wreck. The game proved popular, and a series of extra scenarios and rules appeared in the magazines White Dwarf and Citadel Journal. The earliest articles from White Dwarf were collected and published in 1990 as two separate expansion packs ‚Äî Deathwing and Genestealer ‚Äî and most of the later articles were published in 1991 as a book, Space Hulk Campaigns. Deathwing, released as a boxed set, introduced the Deathwing Company (First Company) of the Dark Angels Space Marines Chapter, including the Captain and the Librarian. The expansion included: * New rules and additional Terminator weapons, greatly expanding the tactical possibilities for the Terminator player. * New rules allowing the Space Marine player to play the game solo. * Additional board sections that could be added to the original Space Hulk board. * Several new missions. Reception In the April 1991 edition of Dragon (Issue #168), Ken Rolston complimented the original Space Hulk game for its \\"fast pace of play and lots of action and mayhem.\\" About the new expansion, Rolston commented that \\"The Deathwing set contains some useful supplemental material and more scenarios.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1990 ","title":"Deathwing (board game)"},{"id":"62678899","text":"Arvidsjaur porphyry () is a group of igneous rocks of intermediate to felsic composition found near Arvidsjaur in northern Sweden.

He has been the general secretary of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) since 2015. Biography =Early life= His father, born at in France, fought in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Philippe Martinez's mother comes from Santander in northern Spain. Philippe Martinez attended school in Rueil-Malmaison, west of Paris. He engaged into politics as a high school student, first joining the Young Communist Movement and later the French Communist Party. =Professional career= A technician in the metalworking industry, he worked for the Renault factory of Boulogne-Billancourt from 1982, before he was transferred to the Center for Motor Research at Rueil-Malmaison. A union member since 1984, he became the CGT central union delegate at Renault. He left the French Communist Party in 2002 since he disagreed with Robert Hue who wanted to disestablish the Party's sections inside the companies. In 2008, Martinez was elected general secretary of the Metalworkers' Federation (FTM-CGT), the third largest federation within the CGT with 60,000 members.. In this respect, he negotiated with the employers within the scope of the reorganisation of the automotive industry, thus showing his ability to discuss by containing the most radical elements of his union. In 2013, he was elected a member of the CGT executive committee. =General secretary of the CGT= Even if he was foreseen to become the general secretary of the union, Martinez was unknown to the public. Even though his team was seen as too close to the previous leading team, it was elected with 57.5 percent of the votes of the National Confederal Committee. Martinez's partner Nathalie Gamiochipi, who was appointed to call for votes against Martinez, decided to support him with the votes of the CGT Sant√©, the second largest federation of the CGT with 75,000 members. Martinez was elected general secretary of the CGT by the National Confederal Committee on February 3, 2015 with 93.4 percent of the votes, and was confirmed to that position by the congress of Marseille in April 2016, after he travelled across France during one year to meet the local sections of the union to strengthen his popularity. Even though Martinez embodies the grassroots and the radical line of the union, he is open for labour relations and supportive of the traditional strategy of the union, according to newspapers Le Figaro and Lib√©ration. However, according to Les Echos, Martinez being no longer a member of the Communist Party since 2002, he has been the \\"first [such] general secretary of the CGT since 1946\\", which shows a \\"a further step in the detachment of both organisations\\", even though Martinez did not become supportive of social-democracy.√Ä partir de 1945, L√©on Jouhaux partage la fonction de secr√©taire g√©n√©ral avec le communiste Beno√Æt Frachon, √† qui il remet sa d√©mission le 19 d√©cembre 1947 : voir Moreover, Martinez is the first technician, not worker, to lead the union. 225px To take account of the growing influence of the ultra-left in the union, Martinez took on a hard line of struggle against employers and liberalism, notably against the Valls government by demanding the withdrawal of the 2016 Labour reform bill, to which the CGT became the main opponent. Demonstrations were accompanied by blockades of refineries, repetitive strikes in the transport sector, and stoppage of nuclear power plants, which threatened the smooth running of the UEFA Euro 2016 in France. The Filpac-CGT (Federation of Workers of the Book, Paper and Communications Industry), demanded that all national daily newspapers publish a column of Philippe Martinez ‚Äîcalled (\\"Modernity is Social Progress, not Labour Law!\\")‚Äî, for them to be printed out. Only the newspaper L'Humanit√© published the tribune, and the Filipac voted a strike to stop printing the newspapers, which aroused criticism from newspaper leaders and the national daily press union (SPQN), in the name of freedom of the press. Faced with the internal oppositions and the decreasing importance of the CGT in the staff representatives elections, this anti-establishment opinion could enable the union to unify the militants and draw benefit from the left-wing voters' dissatisfaction toward the Socialist Party government. Martinez was re-elected as the general secretary of the CGT during the union's 51st congress in Marseille in April 2016. Under Martinez's chairmanship, in March 2017, the CGT became the second most important union in the private sector after the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT). However, it remained the largest union in small businesses and in the Civil Service and therefore remained the largest organisation among all wage earners. Under Martinez's direction, the CGT organised a 36-day strike in the first semester 2018 against the government's reform plans of the SNCF. In May 2019, Martinez was re-elected general secretary of the CGT during the 52nd congress in Dijon. He was the only candidate to his own succession and was re-elected with 90.65 percent of votes. Opinions When he was elected the general secretary of the CGT, Martinez proposed to reduce the weekly work time to 32 hours to enable the creation of four million new jobs. He also supports a ‚Ç¨1800 gross monthly minimum wage, a 60 years old retirement age, and opposes the payment of dividends to shareholders. Between the two rounds of the 2017 French presidential election between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, Martinez claimed he wanted \\"Macron to have the highest possible score\\" against the National Front candidate, thereby overstepping the original position of the GGT. Martinez supported the welcoming of migrants several time: for instance in 2018, he claimed that it was France's \\"duty\\" to \\"welcome them all\\" and considered as \\"scandalous\\" the government's decision to distinguish economic migrants from refugees. Private life Martinez lives with Nathalie Gamiochipi, former general secretary of the CGT Sant√©, the second largest federation of the CGT with 75,000 members.

Noisey included their album \\"Resonate/Desperate\\" as one of the records that best captures the last decade of hardcore punk. In 2019, they were listed at number 16 on Kerrang's 50 Best American Hardcore Bands Right Now list. History The band formed in 2010, under the name Brother Bear, releasing their debut EP, Head In the Clouds the next year. However changed their name soon after due to the large number of bands who were also operating under that name. On 8 May 2012, they released their debut album Desolate Peaks through Tiny Engine Records. On 12 November 2013, they released their sophomore album Resonate/Desperate through No Sleep Records. In 2015, Kelley departed from the band, at the same time as Chris Hansen from No Sleep Records was pushing the band the put a new record. This led to the three remaining members deciding to officially break-up and work on a separate musical project, which would turn out to be noise rock band Slow Bloom. In 2019, Andrew, Weldon and Wallace reformed State Faults, due to increased interest by fans and began recording material. Their first performance after reforming was at Santa Rosa's Chop Shop on 18 February, with support from Outlier, Sloth & Turtle and Pushing It. Their third album Clairvoyant was released on 21 June 2019. In December 2019, Brooklyn Vegan placed Resonate/Desperate at number 95 on their top 100 punk rock and emo albums of the 2010s. In addition to this, Chris Luedtke of Metal Injection included the album as an \\"Honourable Mention\\" in his list of the greatest albums of 2019. Musical style State Faults have primarily been categorised as screamo and post-hardcore possessing elements of black metal, post-rock, shoegazing, heavy metal, noise rock, mathcore and heavy psych. Their music often makes heavy usage of dynamics, by incorporating both ambient and cacophonous passages. Their softer sections are often utilized through the usage of reverb effects, ambient synths and occasionally spoken word. Dan Ozzi, a writer at Noisey, described their music as \\"what a panic attack sounds like\\". Sometime tracks such as Wildfires incorporate melody and hooks into unclean vocals. Lyrically, their music generally focuses on spirituality, makes use of references to the occult and is heavily emotional. A number of the tracks on their debut album were based on anxiety and its repercussions. In an article for No Echo, Adam Yoe described their lyrics as \\"meditation on trauma and healing\\".

The Cascouia river valley is served by the route 169 and the ‚Äúroute des B√¢tisseurs‚Äù which bypasses the northern part of the lake. This valley is also served by a few secondary forest roads, especially for forestry and recreational tourism activities.Open Street Map - Accessed February 7, 2019 Recreational and tourist activities are the main economic activity around Cascouia Bay, especially vacationing around Lac du Camp; hydroelectric activities, second; forestry, third. The surface of the Cascouia River is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid-December to mid-March.  Geography  Following successive increases in the water level of Kenogami Lake in the early 20th century, Cascouia Bay expanded at the expense of the former Cascouia River, becoming a lake pass. The Cascouia River is located in the former municipality of lac-K√©nogami. The main watersheds neighboring the Cascouia River are: * north side: Chamois lake, Potvin lake, Bruy√®re River, Dorval River, Dup√©r√© brook, Saguenay River; * east side: Kenogami Lake, rivi√®re aux Sables, Chicoutimi River; * south side: Kenogami Lake, Pikauba River, ruisseau L'Abb√©; * west side: Vert Lake, Rivi√®re des Aulnaies, Pont Flottant stream, La Belle Rivi√®re. The Cascouia river originates from a small unidentified lake (length: ; altitude: ) in the shape of a V. This source is located at: * south-west of the village center of Larouche where the Canadian National railway passes; * north-west of Cascouia Bay from Kenogami Lake; * south of the Saguenay River; * south-east of downtown Alma; * north-west of the confluence of the Pikauba River and Kenogami Lake; * east of the barrage de Portage-des-Roches; * south-west of the confluence of the Chicoutimi River and the Saguenay River. From its source (small unidentified lake), the Cascouia river flowed on with a drop of entirely in the forest zone, according to the following segments: * towards the south-east by crossing the current Camp lake on , until its mouth; * towards the south-east crossing the current Cascouia bay, up to the Cascouia pass; * south-east across the Cascouia pass, to the natural mouth of the river. The old course of the Cascouia River emptied into Epiphanes Bay on the north shore of Kenogami Lake; following the erection of dams on Kenogami River, the old course is largely under the waters of this dam lake. This former confluence was located at: * east of the rue des B√¢tisseurs bridge (spanning the Cascouia river); * south of autoroute 70; * southwest of Lac Barrage Pibrac-Ouest, located at the head of the rivi√®re aux Sables; * south-west of Jonqui√®re town center; * west of the barrage de Portage-des-Roches; * south-west of the confluence of the Chicoutimi River and the Saguenay River. From the mouth of the Cascouia river, the current crosses the Kenogami Lake for east to the barrage de Portage-des-Roches, then follows the course of the Chicoutimi river on towards the east, then the northeast and the course of the Saguenay river on towards the east up to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.  Toponymy  Cascouia Bay is frequently called ‚ÄúLac Cascouia‚Äù, due to its isolation from the central part of Kenogami Lake. One of the first known mentions of the Innu word \\"Cascaouia\\" is attributed to the surveyor Joseph-Laurent Normandin, in 1732, who wrote in his Journal: \\"... There is a large bay, which is bordered by jongs and grasses, that the Indians call Les Gachek8illaces de Quinongamingue ‚Äù. Normandin also uses the form \\"Baye des Gachek8illasses\\". By modifying its primitive form in order to facilitate its use, the first explorers perpetuated this Amerindian term meaning \\"grasslands\\" or \\"rushes\\". For some, it is actually cattails. Several orthographic variants exist for this appellation, in particular: Kascouia, Kaskauia, Kaskovia, Kaskouia and Kashkouia. Other Amerindian spelling noted: Kashkouillasses.

The church is built of Sussex and Ardingly sandstone and dates mainly from the early 14th century. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries the church fell into decline and became almost derelict. It was fully restored in the mid-19th century, largely thanks to the efforts of the curate Reverend Francis Hill Sewell, a Cambridge graduate who remained the incumbent at Lindfield until his death in 1862. History =Anglo-Saxon origins= The church is associated with the earliest beginnings of the village of Lindfield, West Sussex. Lindfield first appeared as Lindefeldia, \\"open land with lime trees\\", in a Saxon charter of 765 AD, in which King Ealdwulf granted lands for the building of a minster church, which may be on the same site as the present church.General History of Lindfield Retrieved 27 December 2019 =12th century= In 1150 Archbishop Theobald confirmed the grant of the Manor of Lindfield and its land to the College of Canons at South Malling, near Lewes, whose dean ‚Äì as the archbishop's representative ‚Äì became the rector of the church. The post required him to be resident in Lindfield for at least three months of the year, and to direct necessary repairs to the church.Field, p. 6. =14th century= The present church dates mainly from the early 14th century. It was built of Sussex and Ardingly sandstone ashlar with a Horsham stone slab roof. The tower has a shingled spire with an iron weather vane. The church consists of a nave of two bays with two bay lower chancels. The West Tower also dates from the 14th century and was built in three stages with a trefoiled window to the west on the bottom stage, a lancet window to the middle stage and an oculus window to the top stage. The chancel was built with north and south chapels with typical Late Perpendicular thin piers. =17th century= Archbishop George Abbot (1562 ‚Äì 1633) granted a license to rebuild the church In the late 16th and early 17th centuries the church fell into decline and became almost derelict. In July 1617 Archbishop George Abbot granted a licence to the churchwardens \\"to build the said church then in ruins without battlements\\". The state of the church continued to be a burden on the parish, whose membership numbered only 290 \\"conformist\\" and 10 \\"non- conformist\\" ratepayers. One Thomas Pelling was fined ¬£5.16.3d for \\"refusing to pay his taxation for the repayring of the decayed church of Lindfeild\\".Field, p. 8. =18th century= During the 18th and 19th centuries the state of the church continued to be a problem, and both church and parish were in such a state of neglect that it was said that \\"no part of England was more desolate\\". In 1758 records from Lambeth Palace show that the then curate stated that he was allowed just ¬£20 per year and that this was inadequate, and he appealed to the Archbishop for an increase ‚Äì which was rejected. This led to the absence of any officiating priest, and services were no longer held. =19th century= In the mid-19th century the income from rectoral tithes remained low at just ¬£35 per annum. This sorry state of affairs changed in 1841 with the arrival of the Reverend Francis Hill Sewell as curate, a Cambridge graduate who remained the incumbent at Lindfield until his death in 1862.Field, p. 9. In 1847 the view of the influential Cambridge Camden Society, whose purpose was to return church architecture to the splendour of the Middle Ages, was: Sewell himself contributed more than ¬£650 of his own money towards the estimated ¬£2,000 total needed. The church was fully restored in the mid-19th century. =20th Century= On 10 September 1951 the church was declared a Grade II* listed building. Today All Saints Church viewed from Lindfield High St Today the church still retains many of its historic features. A number of tombs, for example, survive from the 18th Century. The North chapel boasts a marble wall plaque to John Court Esq who died 1794, and an obelisk with oval medallions. The south chapel has a wall plaque dedicated to Sarah Board, who died 1765, and boasts a draped urn and coat of arms.Pevsner, p. 561. In 2013 the \\"Aspire\\" project was launched to \\"repair, re-order and re-vitalise\\" the church. Much of the work was completed in 2018, which included removing the Victorian pews and replacing the flagstones with a modern stone floor equipped with under floor heating. Today the church continues to serve the spiritual needs of Lindfield parish, led by Canon James Clark.

It was studied in the 1980s.Ravna Monastery Historic Site (in Bulgarian) The study found a large number of inscriptions and drawings on stone - about 280 inscriptions in Medieval Greek (with Greek script), Old Bulgarian (with Cyrillic and Glagolitic scripts), Bulgar language (with Runnic script) and Late Latin (with Latin script) and a four-figure drawing of animals, crosses, figures of saints and shamans, horsemen, ships, geometric and floral ornaments and more. In total, more than 330 inscriptions of 5 different graphic systems have been discovered in the monastery - the Runic letter, the Greek letter, the Latin letter, the Cyrillic letter, the Glagolitic letter. In Bulgaria, as well as in the entire Orthodox Slavic world, such an amount of inscriptions from the early Middle Ages was first discovered.

It is set within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest, which is part of the Cascade Range. Four Brothers is northeast of Snoqualmie Pass, on Chikamin Ridge, southeast of its parent, Chikamin Peak. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the west slope of Four Brothers, and again on the east side as it crosses the gap between Four Brothers and Three Queens. The mountain was named in the 1890s for brothers John, Tom, Vic, and Lawrie Denny, miners who lived in a cabin at the base of the four peaks. The mountain is within the Yakima River drainage basin. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains west into headwaters of Gold Creek, or east into Glacier Lake. Climate Four Brothers is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

He lives in Juva. Turtiainen was elected to the parliament in the 2019 parliamentary election. Criminal record In December 2015 Turtiainen published a Facebook status saying that \\"people had taken great personal risks when acting in elimination operations to destroy existing and planned asylum centres\\". In his Facebook status, Turtiainen considered the Finnish Red Cross to be his greatest enemy and wrote if \\"it was now time to expand operations to the enemy headquarters\\". The matter escalated into a controversy after Member of Parliament Laura Huhtasaari had liked the status. The Finnish Red Cross reported Turtiainen's message to the police. In September 2018 Turtiainen was sentenced in the district court of Southern Savonia to 60 day-fines for public incitement to crime. After being elected as a Member of Parliament, Turtiainen commented that \\"in this company a criminal sentence is just a feather in my cap\\". Turtiainen has also been sentenced for assault. According to Helsingin Sanomat, the district court of Southern Savonia sentenced Turtiainen to fines in March 2010 for assaulting a 14-year-old boy from Juva. Turtiainen had been previously sentenced for assault in 1997 and 1995.  Controversy  On 3 June 2020 Turtiainen mocked George Floyd on his Twitter account with a tweet showing an image of Floyd, a police officer's knee on his neck and his face colorized pink, with the phrase \\"Pink Floyd\\". His parliamentary group called the tweet \\"not acceptable\\". The tweet was later deleted. As a response to Turtiainen's tweet, the Finns Party expelled him from the parliamentary group.Hartikainen, Jarno: Perussuomalaisten eduskuntaryhm√§ erotti Ano Turtiaisen sopimattoman somek√§yt√∂ksen vuoksi, Helsingin Sanomat 4 June 2020.

Background Guenther Reinhardt was born G√ºnther Reinhardt on December 13, 1904, in Mannheim, Germany to a banking family. His parents were Dr. Philipp Victor Reinhardt and Lilli Johanna Zimmern. In 1922, he received a BA from the Royal College of Mannheim, in 1925 a BS in Economics from Mannheim and an MA from Heidelberg University. Later in 1925, he began post-graduate research at Columbia University through 1927. Career Initially, Reinhardt worked as a statistician, first at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company in New York City (1926-1929), then as chief statistician at Toerge & Schiffer (1929-1930)‚Äî\\"his first job as a private investigator.\\" In 1925, Reinhardt began contributing to Swiss newspapers. In 1932, he became a special correspondent for the McClure Newspaper Syndicate through 1938‚Äî\\"while still a private investigator for Wall Street banks.\\" He ghosted a McClure's column went called \\"European Whirligig.\\" In 1939, he joined the staff of the New York Daily News through 1940. In 1946, he was a correspondent for the International News Service. Overall, he contributed to newspaper syndicates and national magazines for more than three decades, 1932-1968. Publications include Life and Look American magazines and Der Bund Swiss newspaper. In the late 1940s, he became a contributor to Plain Talk. =Government investigator= In 1931, Reinhardt became an American citizen. In 1934, he became a consultant to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) through 1935. In 1936 or 1937, he became a special employee (codenamed \\"Hal Hart\\") of the Federal Bureau of Investigation through 1943; he infiltrated the news business and reported to FBI special agents George J. Starr and Edward A. Tamm. One of his best sources was Boston Globe reporter Gardner Jackson, who told Reinhardt (based on hearsay from Stanley Reed and Jerome Frank) that J. Edgar Hoover was a \\"queer.\\" In his 1952 memoir, Reinhardt claimed that in 1941 Ludwig Lore had tipped him off about \\"an extremely clever operative of the Soviet espionage underground in this country,\\" whom the FBI should visit, and \\"That is how Whittaker Chambers' first contact with the FBI came about!\\" correlated by a brief account about in Chambers' own 1952 memoir. In 1943, Reinhardt became a research consultant the Republican National Committee through 1944. In 1944, he became a consultant to the Office of United States Company-Ordinator of Inter-American Affairs through 1945 and then with Counter Intelligence Corps, United States Forces, European Theatre of Operations through 1947. During that time, Reinhardt tried to hunt down six Hungarian SS guards who had murdered downed American airman and accused US Army officials of smuggling \\"Nazi gold\\" into the USA. In 1947, he served as expert consultant to the US Secretary of the Army through 1948. He served as an interpreter during the Nuremberg Trials (1948-9) =Private investigator= In 1949, Reinhardt became a private investigator for Bartley Crum, a San Francisco lawyer and co-publisher of the New York Star through 1959. In 1960, he worked for Silas R. Franz, a life insurance company in New York City. David L. Robb's non-fiction book The Gumshoe and the Shrink depicts Reinhardt as a \\"gumshoe\\" who exposed Richard M. Nixon's secret meetings with psychotherapist Dr. Arnold Hutschnecker, a discovery which helped John F. Kennedy win the presidency. Robb claims that Reinhardt \\"set out to destroy Richard Nixon.\\" In September 1960, Reinhardt had discovered that Nixon was seeing a \\"shrink\\" (psychotherapist) and wrote a 12-page report on Nixon's psychotherapy with Dr. Arnold Hutschenker. In 1964, Reinhardt was arrested for stealing documents from the New York State Liquor Authority to sell to detectives who were posing as \\"underworld agents.\\" By April that year, he had appeared in court 37 times already. Personal life and death On August 5, 1937, Reinhardt married Helen I. Williams. Reinhardt joined the Foreign Press Association (or Association of Foreign Journalists) in 1937 and National Press Club in the 1930s. Guenther Reinhardt died age 63 on December 2, 1968, in New York City. Legacy Ralph de Toledano, with whom Reinhardt was a long-time friend and fellow anti-communist crusader and journalist, wrote of Reinhardt in the 1950s: > Guenther Reinhardt brings to any assignment not only a wide journalistic > background but a decade of top-level intelligence experience... Many of the > exposes now making headlines were wrapped up in his files many years ago. > Through his work with the FBI and the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps, he has > amassed a tremendous knowledge of the secret world of espionage and > subversion which few Americans ever glimpse. He has repeatedly broken > through the security curtain of Nazi and Communist operations, both here and > abroad. The story he has to tell is of vital importance to the nation. Author David L. Robb described Reinhardt in 2012 as: > Cut from the Sam Spade school of private detecting and the One Flew Over the > Cuckoo's Nest school of personal behavior, Reinhardt was a bipolar Don > Quixote, a manic-depressive knight errant in search of adventure and a fast > buck. Miscellaneous With regard to the \\"European Whirligig,\\" Frederick Sondern Jr., prior to serving as an editor for Reader's Digest and also writing for Brotherhood of Evil: The Mafia, was the name appearing on the McClure column, \\"European Whirligig.\\" Works In his best known work, Crime Without Punishment (November 1952), Reinhardt recounts several cases related to Soviet espionage in the United States, including the death of Juliet Stuart Poyntz (for whom his major source was Ludwig Lore), Arkadi Maslow, Leon Trotsky, Otto Ruhle, Horst Berensprung, Ellen Knauff, and Karl Nierendorf. Reinhardt objected to points made by New York Times reviewer John H. Lichtbau (also a former colleague in the Counterintelligence Corps in Germany). To the criticism that Karl Nierendorf's name goes unmentioned in authoritative accounts on German communism, for example, Reinhardt retorted that of course the name did not appear openly because \\"I deal with secret agents.\\" Books: * You Americans; fifteen foreign press correspondents report their impressions of the United States and its people (1939) * Nathan the Wise (Nathan der Weise) (1950) (translation) * Crime Without Punishment: The Secret Soviet Terror Against America (1952) * The Jews in Nazi Germany (same as AJC book? ) * Source Materials for Psychological Warfare Articles: * \\"Invasion Prayers Are Ready,\\" New York Times (1944) References Category:1904 births Category:1968 deaths ","title":"Guenther Reinhardt"},{"id":"62679857","text":"Eva Ko≈•√°tkov√° (born 1982, Prague) is a Czech installation artist and film maker.

The book is illustrated by James Crabtree, Darryl Elliot, Joshua Gabriel Timbrook, Quinton Hoover, and Dan Smith, with cover art by John Zeleznik. Mage: The Acension supposes that everyone in today's world carries the innate ability to do magic. Those that are unaware of their powers are \\"sleepers\\"; those who have become aware of their ability to reshape reality are the Awakened. Digital Web explores those mages called Cybernauts who use the internet as a manifestation of magic power. Divided into five chapters, the book covers: * the Cybernaut's three main forms of ingress into the Web (Sensory Visitation using virtual reality goggles; Astral Immersion, projecting one's mind into the Web; and Holistic Immersion, transforming oneself into raw data to be uploaded into the Web.) * various special areas of the magical Web * viruses and other dangers that lurk in the Web * a history of the magical Web, from Alexander Graham Bell to Alan Turing. * Explanations for how magic operates within the Web * suggested ways to use the Digital Web in other White Wolf role-playing games set in the modern world such as Vampire: The Masquerade and Werewolf: The Apocalypse. * Two brief scenarios, \\"Recursive Tale\\" and \\"Deus ex Machina\\". * Various notable personalities within the Web * Talismans that can be used within the Web The book also includes a three-page short story, and an appendix with further sources for the reader to explore. Reception In the November 1994 edition of Dragon (Issue 211), Rick Swan called the premise of Digital Web \\"audacious\\", saying that it \\"reshapes cyberpunk like so much modeling clay.\\" But despite this, Swan found the book \\"hard to digest\\" [...] the text is burdened with overstuffed sentences [...] and saturated with gobbledygook.\\" He concluded by giving the book an average rating of 4 out of 6, saying \\"There's much to admire, particularly for those who believe that cyberpunk could stand to shed some cliches. But the text is so dense, so riddled with gamespeak and consumed by abstractions that a good portion of it borders on the incomprehensible. Digital Web is an impressive effort.

She is a professor at the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, where she researches fluid mechanics to the sub-nanometre level. She was a co-developer of a surface- forces measuring device for very small-scale interactions. Biography She was a post-doctoral researcher at ESPCI Paris, studying the properties of porous materials in work funded by Exxon. She joined the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Lyon physics laboratory, where she studied wetting phenomena at the microscopic level and the effects of humidity on granular media. After her appointment as professor at Claude-Bernard University, she joined their Department of Materials Physics, which became the Laboratoire de physique de la mati√®re condens√©e et nanostructures (LPMCN) [Laboratory of Condensed Matter and Nanostructure Physics]. At LPMCN, she researched fluid dynamics at nanoscales (nanofluidics) which progressed following the construction of an original surface forces measuring apparatus in 2002, which was developed with J√©r√¥me Crassous and :fr:Fr√©d√©ric Restagno; the apparatus uses a combination of capacitance and interferometry to measure the forces, with which important data was found concerning the link between wettability and hydrodynamic conditions at solid-fluid interfaces.. In 2010, she joined the interdisciplinary physics laboratory in Grenoble. She was able to show that nanohydrodynamic measurements make it possible to have access to the mechanical properties of surfaces without solid contact and she highlighted the advantage and convenience of confining surfaces during nanorheology experiments. As well as analysing various properties related to capillary adhesion and the sub-nanometre properties of bubbles and thin films, for example, her teams have also discovered properties relating to energy storage in hydrophobic pores in powders. In addition to her academic awards, she became a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur in 2011. An international conference was held in her honour at the University of Bordeaux in 2018.

History  Dr. AP Ranga Rao is credited with first conceptualizing 108 ambulance services in India, having spent 10 years working with the National Health Service (NHS) in Britain learning about emergency systems. In January 2005, the CEO of an Indian-based, German multinational corporation, Venkat Changavalli, invited Ramalinga Raju, the Chairman of Satyam Computer Services at the time, to be the chief guest at a business conference. After the conference, Raju proposed creating an emergency medical services organization for India, and the Satyam Foundation began initial its operations. Emergency Management & Research Institute (EMRI) was separately founded and on April 15, 2005, Changavalli became the CEO of EMRI. Satyam Foundation's operations were later integrated into EMRI, with Satyam Computers (later purchased by Tech Mahindra) remaining the technology partner. EMRI was launched on August 15, 2005 with 14 ambulances and 70 employees in Andhra Pradesh. When Raju was imprisoned for corporate fraud in January 2009, Changavalli had grown EMRI to eight states across India as CEO. The scandal compromised EMRI, which had to operate without funding for four months while receiving funding assurances from the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, YS Rajasekhara Reddy, until May, at which point GVK acquired EMRI, rebranding the organization as \\"GVK EMRI.\\" In 2013, Changavalli stepped down as CEO of GVK EMRI. In 2015, GVK EMRI signed an MoU to expand its operations to Sri Lanka, and had expanded there by the end of the year. GVK EMRI began digitizing their operations in 2016. By 2017, GVK EMRI had expanded to 14 states and partnered with Robert Bosch GmbH to improve their technology usage.  Structure  EMRI was structured as a not-for-profit and continues to operate via public-private partnerships created with the government of Indian states. EMRI services are provisioned to the public free of charge. 85 to 90% of patients treated are the poorest people in India. EMRI's ambulance system is financially supported by state governments, the federal government, and by philanthropic contributions. GVK EMRI's service has grown to 16 states and a fleet of 10,000 ambulances and 47,000 employees, becoming recognized as the world's largest ambulatory provider, providing emergency medical coverage to 800 million people. GVK EMRI's 27 dispatch centers receive 130,000 calls per day, to which GVK EMRI emergency medical providers respond to 80,000 emergency calls and assist with 200 childbirths per day, claiming to save 800 lives daily. GVK EMRI said its service saved more than 1.5 million lives between 2005 and 2015, though no outside entity has verified its claim. In a study published in Health Affairs in 2016, research conducted in two Indian states where GVK EMRI operates demonstrated their service helped reduce neonatal and infant mortality. To enhance efficiency, GVK EMRI centralized and vertically integrated dispatchers at call centers with the prehospital emergency care providers, dissimilar to American 911 models in which dispatch centers may be distinct from the organizations providing care. GVK EMRI has partnered with Stanford Medicine faculty to conduct needs assessments and improve the quality of emergency care, as well as faculty from Michigan Medicine to conduct trainings of laypeople and develop specific trauma resuscitation protocols, while training educators and researching emergency stabilization centers.

Creation and structure The National Committee for the Liberation of Detainees (CNLD) was created on 26 August 2019 by lawyers, families of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, human rights activists and intellectuals. The founding coordinator of the CNLD was Kaci Tansaout. Methods The CNLD has legal, solidarity and communication committees. In its comunications strategy, the CNLD considers the national and international circulation of reports about \\"every detention, arrest or abuse\\" as a key \\"principle\\". Pre-election detentions When the CNLD was created on 26 August 2019, its coordinator, Tansaout, stated that there were 42 prisoners of conscience in Algiers, some having been detained since June 2019. He considered the detentions to be illegal and interpreted them as a method of blackmail by the government to persuade the Hirak protestors to accept the holding of the 2019 Algerian presidential election on 12 December 2019. On 9 September, the CNLD announced the release of Hakim Aissi, who risked up to 10 years of imprisonment for \\"assaulting national unity\\" for having carried the Berber flag during Hirak protests. Aissi had been detained on 5 July. He was found not guilty by the Mostaganem court. The CNLD at the time estimated that about 40 Hirak prisoners were detained in Algiers for having carried the Berber flag. On 6 October, the CNLD saw a pattern of harassment by security forces: \\"a hunt operation\\" and \\"kidnappings\\" of members of the CNLD, of , of the Network for fighting against repression (created on 1 June 2019), and of detainees' family members. The CNLD had 81 detainees documented, and the cases of 13 demonstrators arrested in early March 2019 for \\"destruction of public property\\" were under discussion by the CNLD lawyers. In late November, Tansaout estimated the number of detainees since June at more than 200. He considered the authorities to be using violence and detentions with the aim of provoking demonstrators into responding violently, justifying increased repression and leading to a \\"state of emergency eagerly sought by [chief of staff of the Algerian army] Gaid Salah\\". Tansaout criticised the detainees' prison conditions, including solitary confinement of some detainees, a surgical operation carried out without informing either the detainee's family or lawyer, prison cell overcrowding and the lack of drinking water. Post-election detentions On 17 December, after Abdelmadjid Tebboune's 12 December election as president, Tansaout expected repression by the authorities to continue. He stated that the CNLD recorded 1200 arrests during the three days from 11 to 13 December. He interpreted \\"the army still [remaining] in control of political decisions. A week later, Tansaout noted the 23 December release of 13 prisoners of opinion, after they had served a six-month term, but overall saw \\"no sign of deescalation by the regime\\". According to Tansaout, Tebboune \\"didn't even murmur a single word about the detainees\\" during his electoral campaign. On 20 December, Farid Hami of the CNLD was \\"kidnapped in Algiers during a march\\" but soon freed. This was interpreted by Tansaout as one of many incidents of intimidation by the security services. In late December, the detention conditions remained bad. One prisoner who had just been released, Messaoud Leftici, had been \\"placed in a room in area, without light\\". Tansaout stated that there was strong volunteer support for the detainees from lawyers, psychologists and medical personnel. The CNLD estimated that there were 180 Hirak protestor detainees, counting from the end of June, who were either under remand or had been sentenced to prison terms.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic Preparations for the 2020 season featured all fifteen clubs from 2019, but the season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was formally declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020, three weeks prior to the scheduled start of the premiership season. Governmental restrictions on non-essential public gatherings during the pandemic meant that, as a minimum, matches would need to be played before empty stadiums, as was planned for the Australian Football League; however, AFL clubs with VFL reserves teams or affiliates had separate concerns that their players could be exposed to the virus when playing in the VFL, since the state league would not be able to offer the same level of medical and quarantine protections that the fully professional league could. AFL clubs began to withdraw their AFL-listed players from their VFL preseason programs, before the start of the VFL season was suspended indefinitely on 16 March. The AFL season was suspended shortly afterwards, and state government lockdowns precluded any state football being played. Soon after, ended its reserves affiliation with the Northern Blues. Carlton had been investing significant money in the VFL club and in developing it as a pathway to senior football, but the financial impact of the pandemic forced Carlton to make significant cuts to its expenses, and ending its affiliation was one of these cuts. The Northern Blues club was by this stage reliant on Carlton for its financial viability; as a result, the club temporarily dropped out of the league after 101 years of membership. Carlton is now expected to adopt a lower-cost strategy by fielding a stand-alone reserves team when AFL players are next released to play in the VFL. The Northern Blues initially announced that they would fold, but regrouped throughout the year and found a model under which it would be viable as a stand-alone club; as a result, the club will to return to the league under its previous Northern Bullants name from 2021. After months of uncertainty, and as lockdowns were being lifted, it was agreed on 16 June to play a shortened VFL season, with training to start from 13 July and the season to begin on 1 August. Significantly, however, all AFL clubs were required to continue to keep AFL-listed players away from the state league systems for the entire season, in order to better control their quarantine environments and avoid risk to the AFL season; this means that AFL reserves teams were unable to contest the restarted season, and the three remaining clubs with reserves affiliations ‚Äì Box Hill, Casey and Sandringham ‚Äì would need to temporarily play as standalone senior clubs for the first time in two decades, and were allowed to top up their playing lists, including getting first selection of any VFL-listed players from the AFL clubs' reserves teams who were seeking new teams for the season. This, coupled with the Northern Blues expecting to fold and being in no position to field a team, initially left only eight clubs to contest the shortened season. However, two weeks later, on 3 July, Casey announced its withdrawal from the season as well. Although the club had been preparing for the season and signing players to bolster its list, it opted to withdraw citing concern about health risks amid an ongoing rise in Victorian cases at the time. The club was also dealing with the fact that it was not able to use Casey Fields, as it was normally shared with the AFL's Melbourne Football Club as a training venue, and quarantine segregations were required between VFL and AFL systems. Preparations continued, but on 7 July, the same date that the new fixture was released to clubs, the second wave of virus cases across Melbourne resulted in a new lockdown being imposed by the government which all but precluded organised sport in the state until at least 19 August (and ultimately lasting several months beyond that). The following day, the decision was made to cancel the season outright. It was the first senior VFA/VFL season to be cancelled since 1944, when the VFA was suffering from a financial crisis that was exacerbated by Australia's participation in World War II. Notable events *Coburg's normal home venue, Piranha Park, was under a planned redevelopment during the year. Under the original fixture prior to the suspension, most of the club's home games were scheduled at Highgate Reserve, Craigieburn, with once-off home games were scheduled for: Preston City Oval, Avalon Airport Oval, Mars Stadium and MacPherson Park (Melton).

The course of the rivi√®re aux √âcorces North-East crosses the western part of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. The valley of the rivi√®re aux √âcorces Nord-Est is served indirectly by the route 169 and directly by the forest road R0261 which goes up the valley of the rivi√®re aux √âcorces and the Rivi√®re aux √âcorces Nord- East. This valley is also served by some secondary forest roads, especially for forestry and recreational tourism activities. Forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; recreational tourism, second. The surface of the rivi√®re aux √âcorces North-East is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid-December to mid-March.

A simple round cap, the Welsh Wig had a distinctive long back of soft wool to keep the neck warm, which often approximated the appearance of long curly hair. Background The Wool Industry was an important part of Welsh life throughout history. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries areas like Monmouthshire and West Glamorgan were famous for quality wool, and Wales gained an international renown for high quality woollen products such as caps. This reputation saw a vast increase in trade and Welsh woollen goods found new export markets throughout Northern Europe. Welsh goods during this era were produced on an semi-industrial scale, with varieties of woollen caps, such as the iconic Monmouth Cap being obvious progenitors to the Welsh Wig. Though it is unknown how early the distinctive Welsh Wigs began production, they were well known throughout Great Britain by the eighteenth century. Development The Welsh woollen industry was in sharp decline by the early nineteenth century, with the newly industrialised woollen mills of Northern England now dominating the British market and fluctuations in European trade of the Napoleonic Era proving particularly challenging. The decline was reversed when the new industrial populations of Wales demanded specific woollen goods for working life in the mid-late nineteenth century. The Welsh Wig, the Crys Fach (a short fronted metallurgical workers shirt), coal miners underpants, shawls, bedgowns and the newly popularised Traditional Welsh costume, all maintained and grew the Welsh wool industry. Popularity The Welsh Wig was prized for its excellent protection against the elements, providing a shield against the wind on the back of the neck. With the decline of traditional wigs, there was a market for knitted head wear throughout the British Empire. The Welsh wig became associated not only with workers but also with stagecoach travellers, polar and mountain explorers and was part of the \\"kit list\\" for men in The Crimea. In Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol the character Mr Fezziwig is described as wearing A Welsh Wig. His name is also likely an allusion to the garment.

Biography Zakhem was born to a wealthy family in Lebanon but his father disinherited him when he emigrated to the United States. He came to the US after graduating from the American University in Cairo in 1957. He went on to graduate with a master's degree in economics at the University of Detroit.

Ambassadorship Zakhem‚Äôs fundraising for conservative political causes was part of the reason Ronald Reagan appointed him as Ambassador in 1986. The State Department was not impressed because ‚Äú his resume lacked foreign affairs expertise, and one State Department observer labeled him an \\"amateur\\" dangerously miscast in the hot- spot of Middle East politics.‚Äù At the time of his appointment, some said he was the most dangerous person in the Middle East.

He also argued with CIA analysts over whether or not the family ruling Bahrain would be overthrown by the pro-Iranian Shiite majority in the country. It turned out Zakhem was right.. He has also been criticized for his role in the sale of an advanced anti-aircraft missile, the Stinge, which are portable and shoulder-launched. In 1992, Zakhem and two other men were indicted and ‚Äúcharged with secretly accepting $7.7 million from the Government of Kuwait to act as undisclosed foreign agents in a \\"propaganda campaign\\" to generate support for the war against Iraq.‚Äù According to the indictment, the men failed to report the money, a violation of Federal tax laws, and while lobbying the US Congress and Administration, did not disclose their status as Kuwaiti agents, a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

His first album for that label, Life Down Here On Earth, got notice if for no other reason than for the fact that it was among the first batch of releases from this high-profile band of renegades. It found Welch tapping into his roots a bit, sounding more like a Guy Clark acolyte than a possible contributor (to) the country charts.\\" Peter Margasak of The Chicago Reader comments that, \\"Welch's Life Down Here on Earth is an exuberant, literate collection that opens country up, stretching it from Steve Earle-ish twang to Bob Dylan-esque narratives\\" Gerry Galipaul of Pause&Play; writes, \\"The business at hand is ‚ÄúLife Down Here On Earth,‚Äù an authentic country-soul- gospel stew filled with fresh writing and a keen wit. The reviews for a truly Americana album free of big-label hype and manipulation have been overwhelming.\\" Rick Ellis of All Your Screens writes of the title track on this album, \\"There are a lot of great Kevin Welch songs to fall in love with and there isn't a better place to start than \\"Life Down Here On Earth.\\" Richard Skanse of Lone Star Magazine notes of the album's opening number, \\"Incidentally, Welch opened Life Down Here on Earth with a song he co-wrote with (John) Hadley called \\"Pushing Up Daisies.\\" Six years later, the song quietly popped up again on a record called Scarecrow by another Okie of some renown: Garth Brooks.\\" Lee Nichols of The Austin Chronicle writes, \\"Welch's new Life Down Here on Earth, his third album, and the first since leaving the corporate giant Warner Bros. label Reprise. Despite his newfound label independence, this new disc doesn't really offer any changes from previous works - meaning it's his usual great collection of well-written songs, surrounded by extremely skilled sidemen. As always, Welch takes country onto an intellectual plane, exhibiting a Joe Ely-ish zest for life and a Gram Parsons-like high and lonesome. It's an impressive first American release for the fledgling label, and it will probably satisfy Welch's goal, which is to just make a decent living writing and singing songs.\\" *See original reviews for full articles.

It was built in 1970 by the Swiss manufacturer Habegger Engineering Works and opened on 21 July 1971. Before its construction, the only way to the observation deck was to hike down the canyon to the pedestrian suspension bridge that bridges the canyon. Overview The aerial tramway contains two cabins that can carry 25 people each, plus the cabin attendant. Each cabin travels up and down along its own track rope at a maximum speed of 5 m/s (18 km/h, 984 ft/min) over an inclined length of 341 m (1118 ft). The horizontal distance between the terminals is 303 m (994 ft) and their difference in altitude is 157 m (515 ft). The mean inclination between the terminals is 51%. The track ropes have a diameter of 40mm, the haul rope connecting the two cabins via the drive bull wheel in the upper terminal has a diameter of 19mm and its counter rope 15mm. The track ropes are anchored in the upper terminal and are tensioned by two concrete blocks of 42 tons each suspended inside the lower terminal where the blocks have a leeway of 7.9m to move up and down. The haul rope and its counter rope are tensioned by a counterweight of 3.5 tons, also in the lower terminal. The max output of the motor is 140 HP (104 kW). The total carrying capacity of the aerial tramway is 530 passengers per hour (one way).

He is known for creating abstract paintings exploring philosophical relationships between cause and effect, absence and presence, and emptiness and meaning; as well as for process-oriented artworks that investigate dualities of existence. Hylden earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts from Minnesota State University in 2001 and Master of Fine Arts from Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles in 2006. He later studied with abstract painter Michael Krebber in Frankfurt, photographer Christopher Williams, and multimedia artist Richard Hawkins in Los Angeles.  Painting style  Hylden utilizes diverse media in his paintings, such as aluminum, pearlescent paint, spray paints, and even blank canvases. Hylden often questions the essence of painting in his artworks. His pieces are often produced as a series and follow a very strict creative process which links all the works through common motifs. Even though the pieces in a series are linked to each other, each one tells a particular story and represents a particular point in time in the evolution of the sequence. For his 2010 series of nine paintings, Hylden devised a strict technical process of painting canvases with holographic gold, arranging them on the floor, spray painting the overlapping sections in yellow, and finally stenciling black stripes onto each piece. As such, he created unique but interconnected pieces. Hylden likes to hint at the source of his abstract paintings. His studio is a source of his inspiration and he has incorporated images of simple objects or groupings of objects from his studio into his paintings. His solo exhibition So There‚Äôs That at Richard Telles Fine Art displays two paintings which depict a vastly magnified portion of the wall in his studio. The art critic Alicia Eler described this as ability to re- contextualize the mundane in the context of art.

Peter (1140/1150 ‚Äì 2 September 1216) was an Italian Cistercian monk and prelate. He was the abbot of Rivalta from 1180 until 1185, abbot of Lucedio (as Peter II) from 1185 until 1205, abbot of La Fert√© (as Peter II) from 1205 until 1206, bishop of Ivrea from 1206 until 1209 and patriarch of Antioch (as Peter II) from 1209 until his death. He is known as Peter of Magnano, Peter of Lucedio or Peter of Ivrea. Peter had a reputation as an administrator and mediator. He consolidated the properties of his abbeys and served several popes as a papal judge-delegate. He was on especially good terms with Pope Innocent III, in whose general reform of the clergy in Lombardy he played a major role. He participated in the Fourth Crusade and the establishment of the Latin Empire of Constantinople (1201‚Äì1205) and in the preaching of the next crusade in Lombardy (1208‚Äì1209). Abbot of Rivalta and Lucedio Peter was born probably in the 1140s into a family of feudatories of the bishop of Vercelli associated with the town of Magnano. He had a brother named Obertus who was living in 1185. Peter was probably educated in the cathedral of Vercelli before entering the Cistercian monastery of Santa Maria di Lucedio. In January 1180 he became the first abbot of San Giovanni di Rivalta Scrivia, a church that became with Peter's appointment a daughter house of Lucedio and a subject also of the bishop of Tortona. During his abbacy in Rivalta, he established the monastic granges of Bassignana, Goide and Isello. In 1185, Peter returned to Lucedio as abbot. He adopted a program of consolidating the abbey's properties. He obtained privileges of protection and confirmation from Popes Urban III (11 January 1186), Clement III (May 1188) and Celestine III (1192). He obtained a diploma of confirmation from the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (14 February 1186). In April 1186, he obtained from Milo, bishop of Turin, an exemption from the tolls of Rivoli for the abbey's subjects. In February 1192, he obtained a confirmation of this exemption from Milo's successor, Arduin. He built up the manors of Montarolo, Leri, Ramazzana, Pobietto, Cornale and Gazzo in the region of Vercelli and won a dispute over property with the monastery of San Genuario. Peter was close to the Marquis Boniface I of Montferrat, whose family, the Aleramici, had founded Lucedio in 1124. In 1193, when Boniface needed money, Peter gave him a loan with the forest surrounding the monastery serving as a pledge. For this, Peter was sanctioned by the Cistercian general chapter. In 1194, Bonifce drew up his will at Moncalvo in the abbot's presence. He left two farms and the mills at Trino to Lucedio. Owing to his skills as an administrator, Peter served several times as a papal judge- delegate alongside Bishop Albert of Vercelli in the 1190s. On 20 July 1191, Albert and Peter handed down a judgement in favour of the cathedral of Genoa against the church of Santa Maria di Castello. In 1196, they were charged with settling a dispute between Boniface, archbishop of Genoa, and his cathedral chapter. The case dragged on until 1201. Sometime between 1195 and 1198, Albert and Peter settled a dispute between the canonry of Oulx and the monastery of San Giusto di Susa in favour of the former. In 1196, they were present at an imperial court in Mortara. Pope Innocent III made extensive use of Peter in Lombardy between September 1198 and 1201, often without Albert of Vercelli by his side. Peter resolved disputes between the dioceses of Pavia and Piacenza in April 1199 and between Piacenza and Parma in May. With the abbot of San Salvatore di Pavia, he performed a canonical visitation of monastery of Bobbio in November‚ÄìDecember 1199. In 1200, alongside Boiamondo, abbot of Chiaravalle della Colomba, he settled a property dispute between the bishop of Tortona and the Humiliati on the one side and the Knights Templar on the other. In late 1200 or early 1201, Innocent sent the representatives of the Humiliati to present their proposed rule of life (propositum vitae) to Peter and Albert. Their rule was approved in 1201. In that year he arbitrated a dispute between the monastery of Fruttuaria and its dependency, San Gemolo di Ganna. Fourth Crusade In the spring of 1201, Peter joined the Marquis Boniface in the preparing for the Fourth Crusade. He was with Boniface at Soissons in the summer, where the marquis formally made his crusading vow before the assembling French army. He probably accompanied Boniface to Paris to meet King Philip Augustus as well. In September 1201, he was at C√Æteaux to obtain the permission of the general chapter to go on the crusade with Boniface. There he presumably took a formal crusader's vow, although the record of the general chapter meeting does not list him among the abbots permitted to go on the crusade. In May 1202 he was back in Lucedio. He went with Boniface to Venice, where the army was gathering, and thence to Rome. During their absence, the crusaders agreed to join the Venetians in an attack on Zadar. In September 1202, Peter was entrusted to carry back a letter from Innocent forbidding the attack on Zadar. It is not certain if Peter arrived in Venice before the army embarked, at Zadar before or during the siege or after the surrender of the city. It has been alleged that he deliberately withheld the letter from the army, but this is unlikely, since Peter retained the confidence of Innocent III until the pope's death. It is more likely that he gave the letter to Abbot Guy of Vaux-de-Cernay in Venice and that Guy read the letter before the leadership at Zadar. Peter was with the army that arrived before Constantinople in June 1203. From then until March 1205 he was rarely far from Boniface. With Cardinal Soffredo of Santa Prassede, he convinced Boniface's new Greek wife, Maria, widow of Emperor Isaac II, to convert to the Catholic faith. In a letter addressed to the pope on 25 August 1203, the Emperor Alexius IV credited Peter, whose zeal he praises, as one of several who persuaded him to restore communion between the Eastern and Western churches. After the assassination of Alexius, Peter was chosen to be one of the twelve electors for a new emperor. Under Venetian influence, they chose Count Baldwin IX of Flanders. When Boniface went to conquer his Kingdom of Thessalonica, Peter followed him. Boniface rewarded Peter by granting him monastery of Chortaiton as a dependency of Lucedio, but Peter was called away by Innocent III in March 1205 to mediate between King Leo I of Armenia and Count Bohemond of Tripoli, who were disputing the succession to the Principality of Antioch. Abbot of La Fert√© and Bishop of Ivrea Peter returned to western Europe in 1205, after receiving news of his election as abbot of La Fert√©, the mother house of Lucedio. He did not hold the abbacy for long, because he was elected to the bishopric of Ivrea in February or March 1206. He left La Fert√© and took up his post in Ivrea, but as soon as he realized its poor financial situation he abandoned the diocese without informing the cathedral chapter, intending to take up life in a hermitage. A letter from Innocent III, dated 21 October 1206, caught up with him and persuaded him to return. He was consecrated as bishop sometime between 30 December 1206 and 11 March 1207. At the same time he was re-nominated as a papal judge-delegate. As bishop, Peter mediated between the counts of Biandrate and the commune of Ivrea concerning some tolls, while at the same time protecting the rights of the diocese and of his old monastery, Lucedio, which had been granted toll exemptions by the counts. In the spring of 1207, Innocent III appointed him one of the \\"visitators and provisors of Lombardy\\" charged with a general reform of the clergy within that region. In this capacity, Peter worked with Albert's successor at Vercelli, Lotario Rosario, and Gerardo da Sesso, abbot of Tiglieto (a sister house of Lucedio). Together they imposed sanctions on the consuls of the city of Piacenza for having exiled their bishop, Crimerio, for unpaid debts. Sometime before March 1208, the three were in Albenga to verify accusations against Bishop Oberto. In November 1208, he was back in Piacenza with Gerardo and Archbishop Umberto IV of Milan to depose Crimerio for having given in to the consuls' demands. In December 1208, Innocent charged him and Gerardo with the task of formally deposing the bishop of Albenga. He also charged Peter, Gerardo and Bishop Sicard of Cremona with preaching a new crusade in Lombardy, which ultimately became the Fifth Crusade. In June 1209, Innocent III offered Peter the metropolitanate of Thessaloniki. He never took it up. In early 1209, Peter I, patriarch of Antioch, died, having been imprisoned by Bohemond during the succession dispute that Peter had been unable to resolve back in 1205. Innocent left the choice of a successor to the patriarch of Jerusalem, who happened to be Peter's predecessor, Albert of Vercelli. Albert selected Peter and Innocent informed him on 5 March 1209 that Peter had been transferred from Ivrea to Antioch. Before leaving Ivrea, Peter made a few donations to the cathedral chapter. He left in May or June 1209 and stopped in Rome on his way. There Innocent entrusted him with letters addressed to the cathedral chapter of Antioch, the clergy of the patriarchate and the garrison of Cursat Castle. Patriarch of Antioch Innocent III praised Peter for accepting the patriarchate of Antioch out of \\"love and the virtue of obedience\\" rather than for worldly advancement, ambition or prestige. In Antioch, Peter found the disputed succession unresolved with Bohemond in actual control of the principality. A planned arbitration in August 1210 never came to fruition because Sicard of Cremona, one of the arbitrators, failed to come east. In order to navigate the disputed succession, Peter opened up communications with the emir of Aleppo, al-Malik al-·∫íƒÅhir GhƒÅzƒ´. On 7 June 1211, in order to further this effort, the pope wrote to al-·∫íƒÅhir GhƒÅzƒ´ commending Peter. The emir of Aleppo was not, however, a neutral but rather an enemy of the king of Armenia. The king had arranged for the election of a rival patriarch, who was deposed by Albert of Jerusalem on the pope's orders. In this situation, the pope wrote to Peter to encourage him to steadfastness. On 26 September 1212, the pope wrote again to express his full confidence in Peter. From 1213 on, there is no more indication of Peter's activities. He was represented at the Fourth Lateran Council by a suffragan. Perhaps he felt too old to undertake the long journey; possibly he was ill. The date of his death is given as 2 September in the necrology of Lucedio and it is known that an election for his successor had taken place by 31 August 1217, when Pope Honorius III annulled the choice of Pelagius of Albano and ordered a new election. Peter's death must have taken place on 2 September 1216.

His style of art mainly focused on realistic portraits, nudes, and still life. Works by Buisseret can be found in museums in Belgium, Barcelona, Madrid, Riga, and Indianapolis.  Biography  Buisseret was born in Binche, Hainault, Belgian in 1888. His parent had encouraged him to study art when he was a child. At age 16, Buisseret studied engraving at the Art Academy of Bergen under Louis Joseph Greuse. In 1908, he studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels under Jean Delville, a mentor who heavily influenced Buisseret‚Äôs later work. After completing the training at Brussel Academy, Bruisseret traveled to Italy with his father to study the works of Italian artists of the Quattrocento and Cinquecento. In 1920, Buisseret actively participated in leading salons and gallery exhibits in Belgium. In 1922, Buisseret married Emilie Empain, who often acted as a model for him. Buisseret's work was exhibited at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh in 1926. In 1928, Buisseret‚Äôs work was rejected by the Salon of La Louviere for its obscene character. This incident led to the establishment of Nervia, a group of artists, by Buisseret, Anto Carte, and Leon Eeckman, who supported promising young artists. In 1929, Bruisseret was appointed as director of the Art Academy of Bergen, where he held the position for 20 years.  Auction  Buisseret's work has been offered at auction multiple times.

Both nations are founding members of the United Nations. History In the early 20th century, several thousand Syrians emigrated from the Ottoman Empire (for which Syria was a part of at the time) to Mexico. Many of the Syrian emigrants were of Jewish origin primarily from Aleppo and Damascus. Several prominent Mexican intellectuals, politicians and businesspeople are of Syrian origin. Mexico and Syria established diplomatic relations on 28 August 1950. In 1958, Syria joined Egypt as part of the United Arab Republic. That same year, relations between Mexico and Syria ceased while Mexico maintained diplomatic relations with Cairo. In 1961, Syria broke from the union and became again an independent nation. Mexico re-established diplomatic relations with Syria in September 1961. In 1994, Mexico opened an honorary consulate in Damascus. In October 2009, Mexican Foreign Undersecretary, Lourdes Aranda Bezaury, paid a visit to Syria. During her visit, she met with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem and reiterated Mexico's interest in expanding and strengthening its presence in the region, as well as in strengthening relations with Arab countries. In December 2010, Syrian Minister of the Environment, Kawkab Sabah al-Daya, paid a visit to Mexico to attend the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Canc√∫n.COP16 In March 2011, the Syrian Civil War began. Since then, relations between both nations have become non-existent. Since the start of the civil war, Mexico's position has been to condemn the violence caused by the parties involved in it and has expressed concern about the serious consequences and humanitarian tragedy arising from the crisis in that country. Mexico has also strongly condemned the use of chemical weapons and serious violations of human rights and International Humanitarian Law. Mexico considers that the only viable solution to the conflict in Syria is one of a political nature, and has called on the international community to act responsibly and avoid sending military equipment and weapons to any of the parties. In 2014, Mexico closed its honorary consulate in Damascus. In July 2014, Mexican Foreign Minister Jos√© Antonio Meade paid a visit to Jordan and traveled visit the Syrian refugee camp of Zaatari to observe the humanitarian crisis facing the refugees.

Built for use as auxiliary craft, Lynx primarily served as an at-sea training platform for junior naval officers, boatswains, reserve personnel and Sea Cadets at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Esquimalt.  Design and Layout  Like other YAG 300 vessels, Lynx was 75‚Ä≤ long overall, 18‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥ wide, had a draft of 4‚Ä≤6‚Ä≥, measured 70 tonnes, and was powered by twin 6-71 Detroit Diesel engines. Lynx was arranged in typical naval fashion with officer‚Äôs housed forward with the galley and their own head, an engine room midships, and cadet room aft with 12-14 bunks in double tiers. The heads are equipped with a pump-action lever, that can be used to pump sewage into the black water treatment tanks held aboard or into the ocean water. Above decks was the wheelhouse mounted on the forward cabin's coaming; aft of that, the exposed breezeway; and, mounted on the after cabin's coaming, a Zodiac launch as well as a food locker and barbeque. Above the wheelhouse was an open bridge, fitted with a chart table and a gyrocompass repeater. A second gyro repeater was fitted on the quarterdeck. Lynx was equipped with a Furuno 1831 navigation radar, with the display located in the wheelhouse.  Operational history  In 1955 she was built for the RCN as YFM 320 (Yard Ferry, Man) and served as a harbour ferry boat. Re-designated as YFP-320 (Yard Ferry, Personnel) in 1960, she was designated as a tender to HMCS Oriole in 1963. Later designated as YAG 320 Lynx, she was regrouped under the control and operation of the Small Boats Unit (SBU) at HMC Dockyard Esquimalt where she was used for seamanship and navigation training until 2007. Lynx was offered for sale by the Canadian Government as part of the YAG 300 Replacement Project, which saw the YAG boats replaced by new Orca-class patrol vessels. In 2011 she was sold to private owners for $11,378, converted to a private yacht and renamed RNOOKNOO.

Tiny Snowflake, you cover us the flowers, then they sleep safely in heavenly peace. Tiny Snowflake, white little skirt, come to us in the valley.

Du wohnst in den Wol  ken, dein Weg ist so weit. } According to the poet's will the song should have been sung to the melody of the song We children, we have so much of joy (Wir Kinder, wir haben der Freuden so viel). The text of this song by Christian Adolph Overbeck was first published in the Musen-Almanach on the year 1777. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart set the revised text in 1791 as a song for voice and piano Das Kinderspiel, KV 598. (See: Neue Mozart-Ausgabe). Another setting had been published by Karl Christian Agthe in 1782. It cannot therefore be said with absolute certainty whether Hedwig Haberkern wanted Mozart's melody for her snowflake song. Since the two known settings are art songs that are melodically and rhythmically more demanding than a simple children's song, it would also be conceivable that Hedwig Haberkern knew another, more folksong melody. The melody common today, the composer of which is not known, has been documented in song books since 1915. However, in the first half of the 20th century, the song was spread across several different melodies. So it was sung on the melody of Im M√§rzen der Bauer as well as on compositions by Johann Andr√© and Kurt Schl√§ger. At the latest after the end of the Second World War, the melody known today prevailed. Occasionally - but only in post-war songbooks - the source is mentioned, that the song was brought by German colonists from Russia or from Courland.

A picket of Chilean soldiers and a Bolivian montonera clashed in Rio Grande, around San Pedro de Atacama. Bolivians are defeated, which eliminates local resistance to Chilean occupation in the Litoral Department. Background After the Chilean occupation of Calama, in March 1879, and other Bolivian villages in the Atacama desert, by the military contingents, the so-called ‚ÄúLoa Line‚Äù was established; with the objective of preventing a Bolivian offensive from the Altiplano and controlling the Litoral Department. In the first months of war the Chilean government took into account the possibility of a Bolivian offensive, with the support of Peru, which in April would enter the war as an ally of Bolivia. In fact, in the Altiplano, a Military Division was being prepared for that purpose, under the command of General Narciso Campero. Over time, the Chilean thought of a Bolivian or Peruvian offensive to the ‚ÄúLoa Line‚Äù was diluted, due to the harsh conditions to cross the Atacama desert, so the territory lost relevance as a war front. But Chilean forces stationed in the area had to face the Bolivian locals, who were organized in montoneras to resist the occupation, hoping to see the Campero Division arrive. Battle Some Bolivians defeated in Calama dispersed through San Pedro de Atacama and then grouped with the locals, forming a montonera of forty men moderately armed with rifles. This Bolivian force was led by Toribio G√≥mez, from San Pedro de Atacama, and by the indigenous chief Jaime Ayo, from R√≠o Grande. Geography of the battle area. On 6 September, in one of the raids of the Bolivian montonera, the Chilean arriero Francisco Vilches was taken prisoner by these near San Pedro de Atacama, but managed to escape by the pleas of a woman when they wanted to execute him. He immediately alerted the Chilean sub- delegate of San Pedro de Atacama, Ignacio Toro, of the presence of the Bolivians. On 9 September, the Sub-delegate Toro, in the company of the Ensign Jos√© Miguel de los R√≠os and a twenty-five men picket of the Regiment Cazadores a Caballo, departed from San Pedro de Atacama to persecute and defeat the montonera. At dawn the next day, Toro and his forces arrive at the entrance of a rough hillside in the gorge of Rio Grande, where Bolivians were hiding on top among huge rocks. When the Chileans advanced to the hillside, the Bolivians attacked them by surprise from their positions at the top, making concentrated shots and throwing large stones that slide from the top. The noise of the stones that fell from the top of the hillside scared the horses that the Chileans rode, causing several of them to be knocked down from the chair and others wounded by the falling stones. But the Chileans, encouraged by a brief harangue, advanced on foot against the Bolivians and defeated them in the defensive positions they occupied. The Chileans had five wounded in battle, one of them seriously. For their part, the Bolivians had thirteen dead in the fight, including their bosses G√≥mez and Ayo, and the rest dispersed. After the battle, the Sub-delegate Toro returned with his forces to San Pedro de Atacama, bringing with him a booty of 200 lambs, 160 goats and 20 donkeys. Aftermath This was the first engagement in the ‚ÄúLoa Line‚Äù that had a bit of importance, after Calama. The small Chilean military contingents in the area had managed to paralyze any Bolivian attack. The Bolivian inhabitants of Atacama were completely demoralized, and some submitted to Chilean authority and others fled into Bolivia. Since November, the war focused on the Tarapac√° region, while between the \\"Loa Line\\" and the Altiplano there were only minor incidents between the outposts of both sides. The Campero division was never able to carry out the offensive against Chileans in the Loa, due to logistical limitations and also to the geographical conditions in the area.

Its plot follows Alicia, a young video rental store clerk in a small Connecticut town who is tormented by bizarre, unearthly phone calls. Meanwhile, a string of violent serial killings are occurring amongst locals. Plot Alicia is a young woman working as an employee at a video rental store in Waterbury, Connecticut. One afternoon, she is met outside her apartment by an elderly man dressed in black who asks to use her phone. She obliges, but finds after the two enter her apartment that the man has strangely disappeared. While out for drinks later, Alicia recounts the bizarre incident to her boyfriend, Mike, a local disc jockey, and her glamorous twin sister, Barbara Ann‚Äîboth dismiss it as a strange coincidence. Meanwhile, a serial killer is murdering young women in the town, and the crimes are being investigated by Detective Tremaglio. While working at the video store one afternoon, Alicia is met by an awkward young man, Franklin, who peruses the store, despite telling her he does not own a video player. He attempts to make conversation with Alicia before leaving. He returns the next day and asks Alicia out on a date, but she politely declines. Later that night, Alicia receives several bizarre phone calls in which she hears Mike and Barbara Ann discussing the romantic affair they are having, apparently unaware they are being listened to. Alicia subsequently has several nightmares within nightmares in which Mike and Barbara Ann come to her apartment and murder her. The next day, Alicia phones Franklin and tells him she would like to go on a date with him after all. He obliges, though he says it will have to wait as he is busy; unbeknownst to Alicia, he is lying in bed with a woman's bloody corpse. After their phone call ends, Franklin has sex with the dead woman's body. Several days later, Alicia and Franklin go on a date to see a movie. At the theater, they run into Barbara Ann, who is also on a date. Alicia, having to work early in the morning, ends her date with Franklin and returns home. Meanwhile, Franklin visits a local bar where he meets another woman and brings her to his house. The two have sex before he eviscerates her with a switchblade. Alicia continues to be tormented by strange phone calls, some of which emit unearthly sounds. Despite changing her phone number, the calls continue. Alicia goes to Franklin's for a dinner date, after which the two have sex. In the morning, Franklin prepares to murder Alicia, but finds she has already left for work. The next day, Barbara Ann visits Franklin at his home and seduces him. After she performs oral sex on Franklin, he murders her. Alicia stops by the next morning to visit Franklin, and finds Barbara Ann's body before being confronted by Franklin. Her screams are heard from Tremaglio, who happens to be patrolling the neighborhood. Tremaglio and his partner shoot and kill Franklin, saving Alicia. Distraught, Alicia returns to her apartment where she continues to be bothered by the recurring phone calls, and enters a depressive state. She is further horrified when she hears on the radio that another female murder victim has been found in town, suggesting Franklin may not have been the primary serial killer. Alicia's mental state continues to rapidly decline. She accepts Mike's repeated requests for a date, and the two begin seeing each other again. One night, after a date with Mike, Alicia receives yet another demented call. She proceeds to destroy her phone in a fit of rage, but the ominous sounds persist as blood pours from the phone receiver. In the morning, the elderly man whom Alicia let into her home several weeks prior is seen emerging from her apartment.

Release =Critical response= Variety gave the film a middling review, describing it as \\"a low-budget horror film made by locals in Waterbury, Connecticut, which tries to surmount the clich√©s of the genre, but emerges as a routine picture.\\" Brian Collins of Birth.Movies.Death. wrote that the film \\"borrows some language from the slasher textbook, but it's also got supernatural elements, police procedural scenes (including a bizarre series of interviews where Capobianco's character talks directly to the camera, usually to fill in gaps in the plot), and a minor psychological thriller flair.\\" =Home media= Disconnected was released on VHS in the United States in 1986 by Active Home Video.

The film stars Ram Arun Castro and Vishnupriya Pillai.  Plot  The movie starts with an interesting note, a girl being followed and murdered in a deserted street and the forensic expert looks like hallucinating about a murder while he is undergoing therapy with his psychiatrist. There is a different story and mystery surrounding the forensic expert Agni (Ram Arun Castro) being treated for his condition nyctophobia which is a special condition about the person fearing darkness. When his friend Luna (Vishnupriya Pillai) from the same department convinces him to take up the case of the recently murdered girl who happens to be Narmadha (Gayathri), the duo start interrogating the victim‚Äôs boyfriend Inba (Lijeesh). Though Inba clearly accepts about some minor misunderstanding between the two despite being in a live-in relationship for about six months, Agni is convinced that there is someone else involved in the crime. There are multiple interrogations with the victim‚Äôs friend and a roadside Romeo who was in touch with her just before the murder. At that point in time, depressed Inba is found dead at his residence with a suicide note. The investigations start around the residential area where the murder took place and the team is able to identify another person as a suspect who starts running away from them. A small flashback is shown depicting the reason for Agni's nyctophobia. Agni was living a happy life with his wife Blessie who was conceived. One day, Agni finds Blessie dead near the staircase and finds a suspect outside his house. Agni chases him but the suspect meets with an accident and passes away. To Agni's shock, it is revealed that while Blessie was climbing down the staircase holding Agni's gun, she accidentally got slipped and fell down. She also unknowingly triggered the gun leading to her death. Agni initially suspected an ice cream seller who saw the incident, became frightened, and ran away as Agni started chasing him. Now Agni understands that Blessie's death was an accident and his wrong intuition led to the death of an innocent ice cream seller. This guilt affects Agni and he suffers from nyctophobia. Agni adopts the ice cream seller's only daughter Sam and puts her in an orphanage. Coming to present, Agni's problem of nyctophobia is revealed to his higher officer and he makes Agni resign his job as he is unfit due to this. However, Agni vows to find the culprit in the next couple of days before resigning. After many rounds of interrogations, Agni sets his eyes on the Narmadha's father. He finds that it was Narmadha's father who actually killed her by stabbing her neck with a pen as her father is more inclined towards caste and he hated his daughter's relationship with another caste guy. Her father gets arrested.

After getting a producer Ram Arun Castro and Malayalam actress Vishnupriya Pillai were roped in to play the lead roles.  Release and reception  The film released to mixed reviews from critics. The Times of India gave the film two out of five stars praising the lack of songs, performances of Castro and Vishnupriya, and the engaging first half, but criticized the second half of the film as it lacked the important elements of a thriller. Sify praised the intriguing beginning of the film, but criticized the screenplay and forced climax twist. The Hindu praised the scene where each character tells the same scene in different ways, but criticized the screenplay and the unreliability of certain scenes. Deccan Chronicle said that the film is \\"enjoyable in parts\\" and criticized the film's climax and the murderer's reason for killing. On the other hand, the Deccan Chronicle praised the performances of Castro and Vishnupriya, the screenplay, and the cinematography.

L. kimuraorum produces one of the loudest sounds in the ocean, a popping sound, at 157 dB, frequencies 1‚Äì100 kHz, similar to the snapping shrimps.  Discovery  The worm was first discovered in 2017. The holotype specimen was found at a depth of , south of Honshu, off the coast of Shima, Mie The holotype was long and wide.

Leocratides kimuraorum can be distinguished by its the length of the antennae, which are as long as palps.  Description  The worm has 21 segments and 16 of them bear chaetae (the bristled setae of polychaetes). The face is somewhat flattened. The body is cylindrical, but tapers slightly toward the posterior end. In life, the worm is transparent, with ring-shaped integument (scaly ridges) along the back, and discontinuous brown stripe markings. Like other members of its genus, Leocratides kimuraorum inhabits hexactinellid sponges.

During these encounters, the pharynx muscles expand rapidly, forming a cavitation bubble that then collapses and produces a loud \\"pop\\" while the worms launch into each other. They may use this mouth-fighting to defend territory or living chambers from other worms. The production of this sound implies unique and extreme biomechanics for a soft-bodied organism.

In 1976, Herv√© de Vathaire, an employee of the Dassault Group withdrew eight million francs from the account of Marcel Dassault and fled with Jean Kay, a mercenary. He was captured in September 1976, but the money was never recovered. Events In 1976, Herv√© de Vathaire, who was private financial director of Marcel Dassault, founder of the aerospace company the Dassault Group, had just lost his wife who had committed suicide. He was sick with cancer, was desperate and went to bars at night. He met Jean Kay, who was a writer, adventurer, mercenary and member of the neofascist Paladin Group, through two women, Bernadette Roels, who was 36 years old and an ex- prostitute, and her friend who was Kay's partner, Danielle Marquet, who he met at a bar. He was seduced by Kay and the two women. Vathaire informed them that he had a compromising tax file against his boss. He decided, under the influence of Jean Kay, to blackmail Marcel Dassault. In June 1976, the two went on a trip to Miami, Florida. According to various sources, it was either a vacation or a meeting with Cuban exiles. Disappearance and return Jean Kay stole Vaithaire's file and blackmailed him in turn. On July 6, 1976, Vathaire went to a BNP Paribas branch and withdrew 8 million francs (800 million old francs, 1.2 million euros, $1.6 million at the time)Robert Nash, Jay (1977) Among The Missing, p.413, . from Marcel Dassault's account which he put in two big bags, and then disappeared with Jean Kay. Vathaire was found, with part of the money. Jean Kay was untraceable. On August 27, two days after the resignation of Jacques Chirac as Prime Minister, the press learned of the scandal and the Vathaire affair came to light. Vathaire returned to Paris on September 26, 1976. What happened to the missing money remains a mystery. Some sources theorized that it may have financed the Lebanese Christian Phalangists in the middle of the Lebanese civil war. Others speculated that the money might have funded two burglaries that were used to finance international networks of the extreme right, including the efforts of Albert Spaggiari who organized the burglary of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale in Nice in August, 1976.

Life and work He came from a family of illustrious painters. His father was the portrait painter, Jos√© Madrazo. His brothers were the painters Federico de Madrazo and Luis de Madrazo. In what may have been an effort to stand out, he chose architecture over painting; becoming an apprentice at the Palacio Real de Madrid; under the direction of Domingo Lafuente, the official Palace Architect. He remained with Lafuente until, in 1846, he was able to become a student at the recently established School of Architecture. After obtaining his degree in 1852, he held a Chair at the \\"School of Construction Masters\\" in Valencia, where he taught composition and legal issues. In 1854, he returned to Madrid. There, he wrote a book on surveying and began another on popular architecture. In 1855, he became involved in an ambitious project to renovate the Puerta del Sol, but it never came to fruition. He was one of the few architects in Madrid who designed buildings in the International Style, as developed by the French architect, Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. Many restoration projects were placed under his direction; perhaps the best known being the exterior decorations on the Church of Las Calatravas.Ram√≥n Guerra de la Vega, (1993), Gu√≠a de Madrid: siglo XIX, Vol. 1, He performed similar work on the Le√≥n Cathedral, for which he was posthumously awarded a medal of honor at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts in 1881.

He started an academic career in Moscow and received his doctorate from Moscow State University (MSU) where he also taught before joining the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR of which he became director. He campaigned against the MSU professor and Jewish academician Isaak Mints during Joseph Stalin's anti-Semitic drive against the \\"rootless cosmopolitans\\" as a result of which Mints lost most of his academic positions. The zeal with which Sidorov opposed Mints was remembered when a position became vacant for a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences and Sidorov was not elected. He edited Istoricheskie zapiski and was on the editorial board of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia and the Soviet Historical Encyclopedia. He was instrumental in the publication of 18 volumes of documents on the 1905‚Äì07 Revolution and ten volumes on the October Revolution of 1917. He researched the development of capitalism in Russia which he concluded had developed largely independently of the rest of Europe, and is considered to have been the father of a new direction in Soviet historiography. Early life and education Arkady Sidorov was born in Pochinki, Lukoyanovsky district, Gorky, now Nizhny Novgorod province, on 27 January (8 February) 1900. He became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1920 and attended institutions of higher education specifically intended to provide a Marxist training, graduating from the Sverdlov Communist University in 1923 and from the Institute of Red Professors in 1928. He published anti-Menshevik and anti-socialist revolutionary views in the press. Career Order of the Red Star (obverse) Moscow State University Building on his training as an activist at the Sverdlov Communist University, Sidorov worked for the Communist party in Nizhny Novgorod, Vladivostok, and Khabarovsk from 1929 to 1936.

The present Anglican church was begun in 1880 and consecrated in 1886, with the distinct tower added in 1910. History The land where St Mary's Church stands was sold to the Anglican diocese by brothers William Barnard Rhodes, Robert Heaton Rhodes, and George Rhodes. The grounds of the Anglican church were consecrated by bishop Henry Harper in 1861. On 9 September 1880, Henry Jacobs (Dean of Christchurch) laid the foundation stone for a replacement church, designed by William Armson in Gothic style. Jacobs stood in for Harper who was ill. Henry William Harper, Harper's son, was the Archdeacon of Timaru at the time. The contract for the construction of the first stage was undertaken by Mr McGill. The contract for the second stage was let, in early 1881, to R. B. Sibly. The quality of Sibly's work was found wanting by an arbitration court and he cancelled his contract. Re-tendering the second stage contract was delayed by a lengthy illness of Armson. Francis John Wilson was the architect for the parsonage that was tendered in July 1881. Soon after, the second part of the church construction contract was let to P. Clayton. Armson died in 1883. It took more than three further years before the church was consecrated by Bishop Harper on 26 August 1886. The 1880s church had cost NZ¬£10,000, the adjacent school NZ¬£1,950, and the vicarage NZ¬£2,200. In a storm on 9 September 1889, the belfry was blown over and the bell cracked, which thus had to be recast. The architectural firm of Collins and Harman provided an alternate design for the square tower. By 1901, chancel, vestries, tower, spire and bells were yet to be added. Plans for the completion of the church were presented to the public in 1906 for fundraising purposes. The church expansion required the removal of the original 1860s church. The foundation stone for the church completion was laid on 14 July 1907 by Archdeacon Harper. The builder for the work was Samuel McBride. Walter Panton from Timaru acted as the supervising architect for Collins and Harman. The distinct tower makes the church a landmark in Timaru. On 2 April 1985, St Mary's was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand) as a Category I building, with registration number 328. St Mary's Church is located on the corner of Church and Sophia streets.

History The steamer was originally merchant vessel Confucius of the American trading company Thomas Hunt & Co., named after the ship's figurehead, a sculpture of Confucius. Confucius was purchased in July or August 1855, funded by shipping merchants in Shanghai as a response to an increase in piracy due to the Taiping Rebellion. She was transferred to Shanghai‚Äôs Pirate Suppression Bureau, where she was used as an armed patrol vessel. During her service as a patrol vessel, she was commanded by an American sailor called Gough, and American sailor Frederick Townsend Ward served as the ship's executive officer. Ward would later distinguish himself in battles and assigned the commander of the Ever Victorious Army. Thereafter, Confucius became part of the Army. In 1860, she took part in the recapture of Songjiang from Taiping rebels. In 1862, she took part in recapturing Ningbo, where she was commanded by Albert √âdouard Le Brethon de Caligny. Later that year, she took part in the Battle of Cixi, where Ward was killed in action. Confucius brought Ward's body back to Shanghai. After the war, Confucius was transferred to Li Hongzhang's fleet in Jiangsu. There, the ship was renamed Tien Ping (), after the model of the steam engine on board.

He is accused of raping Shiori It≈ç, who was an intern at Thomson Reuters. His denials and the police refusing to press rape charges against Yamaguchi sparked the Me too movement in Japan. History Noriyuki Yamaguchi was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1966. He attended the Keio University Faculty of Economics. He later joined the Tokyo Broadcasting System Television (TBS Television) where was assigned to the news department as a photojournalist. His overseas assignments included London, UK, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Washington, DC, US. After retiring, he appeared on TV programs such as TV Asahi and Fuji TV and on radio. Sexual assault litigation Shiori It≈ç formally filed a suit against Yamaguchi in September 2017 for sexually assaulting her in a hotel on April 4, 2015. It≈ç previously filed a police report in July 2016, although it was dropped by prosecutors for insufficient evidence. Ito subsequently filed a complaint with Committee for the Inquest of Prosecution, but a September 2017 ruling did not charge Yamaguchi since \\"there was no common law basis to overturn.\\" A Tokyo court in December 2019 awarded It≈ç 3.3 million yen (US$30,000) plus additional fees in damages from Yamaguchi, however he stated that he will appeal the decision. (She had initially sought from Yamaguchi 11 million yen (US$100,000) in compensation.) Yamaguchi denied the charges and filed a countersuit against It≈ç, seeking 130 million yen (US$1,180,000) in compensation, claiming the incident was consensual and the ensuing accusations has damaged his reputation, although that suit was later turned down due to inconsistencies in his testimony. This ruling has garnered international press due to the lack of reported sexual assaults in Japan and the amount of societal and legal crucibles It≈ç had to endure for speaking up. Disputes with Yoshinori Kobayashi On January 24, 2019, Yamaguchi filed a civil suit against cartoonist Yoshinori Kobayashi. Yamaguchi stated that Kobayashi disseminated false information completely different from the facts in the manga Gomanism Declaration drawn by Kobayashi in the SAPIO magazine's August 2017 issue, where Yamaguchi was depicted as a criminal.\\"Monthly Hanada April 2019\\", Asuka Shinsha, February 29, 2019, pp. 32-39.

More than 140 others were wounded and, as of 31 December, 12 people remained missing. Al- Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack on 30 December. The attack was the deadliest in Somalia since the 14 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings, which killed 587 people.  Attack  The attack occurred at a busy intersection on the western outskirts of Mogadishu, at a police checkpoint during local rush hour. The major intersection connects Mogadishu with the rest of southern and southwestern Somalia. The Ex-Control Afgoye checkpoint is located near a tax office, and is used by vehicles entering Mogadishu from nearby Afgooye town. The truck bomb explosion caused massive damage to the surrounding area, and left many of the dead burned beyond recognition. At least 15 of those killed were university students returning to class at Benadir University, whose minibus was demolished in the explosion. Two Turkish engineers, who were constructing a road from the checkpoint into the city, were also killed in the bombing.Turkey offers condolence to Somalia over terror attack Many others were wounded. Fifteen critically injured people, including an eight month old baby, were airlifted to Istanbul, Turkey for further medical treatment; thirty other critically injured people received medical treatment in Qatar and other neighboring countries. Somali Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire announced the establishment of a national response committee to help the injured and offer support to those who lost family members in the attack.  Responsibility and aftermath  Initially, no group claimed responsibility for the attack. On 30 December, two days after the attack, radical Islamist group Al-Shabaab, which had carried out previous suicide attacks in Mogadishu, claimed responsibility. Through spokesman Ali Mohamud Rageh (also known as Ali Dhere), the group stated that they targeted a convoy of Turkish and Somali forces in the attack, noting that they \\"inflicted heavy losses on the Turks and the apostate militias who were protecting them.\\" Somalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) stated that a foreign country helped organize the attack, issuing a statement that, \\"We have submitted to the national leaders a preliminary report indicating that the massacre against the Somali people in Mogadishu on 28 December 2019 was planned by a foreign country. To complete the ongoing investigation we will seek cooperation from some of the international intelligence agencies.\\" However, the statement did not name the country suspected to be involved or provide additional evidence. The Somali government, in coordination with U.S. Africa Command, conducted three retaliatory airstrikes targeting Al-Shabaab leaders in the Lower Shabelle region after the attack. The airstrikes, in the villages of Kunyo Barrow and Aliyow Barrow, killed four militants and destroyed two vehicles.Al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab claims responsibility for Somalia truck bombing that killed 85  References  Category:2010s in Mogadishu Category:2019 in Somalia Category:2019 murders in Somalia Category:2019 road incidents Category:2010s crimes in Mogadishu Category:2010s road incidents in Africa Category:21st-century mass murder in Somalia Category:Al-Shabaab (militant group) attacks in Mogadishu Category:December 2019 crimes in Africa Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2019 Category:Mass murder in 2019 Category:Mass murder in Mogadishu Category:Road incidents in Somalia Category:Suicide bombings in 2019 Category:Suicide bombings in Mogadishu Category:Suicide car and truck bombings in Somalia Category:Terrorist incidents in Somalia in 2019 Category:Somali Civil War (2009‚Äìpresent) ","title":"December 2019 Mogadishu bombing"},{"id":"62682970","text":"Bellary City Vidhan Sabha seat is one of the seats in Karnataka State Assembly in India.

Loyalists were sometimes referred to as Amanite. Loyalists tried to achieve this in various ways, including armed rebellions, political parties, colluding with foreign powers and assassinations. These movements were unsuccessful, and Amanullah died in exile in 1960 in Z√ºrich, Switzerland without ever regaining control, other than a brief period of control in southern Afghanistan in the 1929 Afghan Civil War.  Rebellions  = 1929 Afghan Civil War = In March 1929, during the 1929 Afghan Civil War, Amanullah assembled an army in Kandahar made up of Durrani, Khattak, Ghilzai and Hazarah fighters. However, his attempt to march on Kabul was unsuccessful, and he retreated to Qalat, where he fell under a Saqqawist siege on 19 May. On 23 May, Qalat fell to the Saqqawists and Amanullah fled to the British Raj. = Shinwari rebellion = The Shinwari rebellion was a rebellion by the Shinwari that took place in February or May 1930 in the Kingdom of Afghanistan. The Shinwari sought to depose Mohammed Nadir Shah and restore Amanullah Khan as king of Afghanistan. Due to lack of support by Shinwari elders (who had been bribed by Nadir), the rebellion was promptly suppressed. The Shinwari's support for Amanullah in 1930 apparently contradicted their earlier revolt against Amanullah in 1928. During this rebellion, the Shinwari claimed that the earlier revolt was \\"not so much anti- Amanullah as against the local tax-collectors at Jelalabad\\". = Kuhistan rebellion = The Kuhistan rebellion was a rebellion in modern-day Kohistan District, Kapisa which took place in 1930 in the Kingdom of Afghanistan. It began in February 1930, when rebels seeking to restore Amanullah Khan as King of Afghanistan broke out in open rebellion against Mohammed Nadir Shah. After killing many, the rebellion was crushed in mid-April 1930. = Crazy Fakir's rebellion = Towards the end of February 1933, a \\"Crazy Fakir\\" appeared in the Khost district in the south of Afghanistan, proclaiming that the ex-king Amanullah will soon arrive. At his instigation a number of tribesmen took arms with the intention of marching on Kabul, and they received considerable reinforcements from the Wazir and Mahsud tribes across the Indian border. They met the government troops which were sent south to oppose them in the neighbourhood of Matun, and some sharp fighting takes place at the end of February and beginning of March. The tribesmen from across the border then began to withdraw at the bidding of some of their elders who were sent by the British authorities to recall them, and the uprising soon came to an end. Later in the year one of the ringleaders, Tor Malang, was executed with some of his associates, but the \\"Crazy Fakir\\", who fled abroad, is allowed to return with the assurance of a free pardon, on account of his advanced age. = Ghilzai rebellion = The Ghilzai rebellion was an uprising in the Kingdom of Afghanistan by the Ghilzai tribe in 1938. Its causes laid in a desire to reinstate Amanullah Khan as king of Afghanistan. A relative of Amanullah, Said al-Kailani, also known as the Shami Pir marched on Kabul with an unknown amount of Ghilzai warriors. There are 2 accounts as to how the rebellion ended - according to British records, the rebellion was defeated in the summer of 1938 by the Afghan army using British-supplied rifles. According to Harvey Smith, the rebellion ended after the British bought off Shami Pir following frantic appeals by the Afghan government. In either case, this rebellion prompted the Prime Minister, Mohammad Hashim Khan, to increase subsidies for Pashtun tribes near the Durand line. = Mazrak's revolt = In February 1944, Mazrak Zadran, an Amanullah loyalist, led an ambush against government troops in the Southern province, after which he was beaten back and forced to retreat into the hills. He continued to fight the Afghan government for the following years. In late 1944, he invaded the British Raj, where he was joined by a Sultan Ahmed, a rebel chieftain from Balochistan. They were later joined by another rebel leader nicknamed Pak. However, Mazrak's fortunes were not to last. He was evicted from British territory due to British bombardment. In October 1945, most Safi surrendered, followed by the surrender of Sultan Ahmad in November. Nonetheless, Mazrak and his brother Sher Muhd Khan continued to fight, refusing to surrender until 11 January 1947.  Political parties  = Anti-Yahya Khel Party = The Anti-Yahya Khel Party (Hizb-i-Zid-Yahya Khel) was a small loyalist political party which was briefly active in 1933. Members of the movement opposed the Musahiban dynasty for political reasons or out of personal spite. In this case, Yahya Khel refers to an alternative name for the Musahiban.  Collusion with foreign powers  = World War II = During World War II, some press in the west reported that Amanullah was working as an agent for Nazi Germany in Berlin.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8180382 It is believed he was involved in plans to regain his throne with Axis help,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/29/archives/afghan-king-in-rome-exile- tightens-belt-daud-sent-money-to-family.html despite Afghanistan's neutrality. However following the Axis loss in Stalingrad in 1943, the plans cooled off and were never executed.  Assassinations  = Assassination of Mohammed Nadir Shah = In November 1933, Mohammed Nadir Shah was assassinated by Abdul Khaliq Hazara, a supporter of Amanullah.

She was the last monarch of the kingdom of Raiatea-Tahaa from 1887/1888 to 1897 before the conquest and annexation of the islands to France. Tuarii was born into the ruling family of Raiatea. Her father was King Tahitoe and her sister Queen Tehauroa. A succession dispute gave the throne to a female-line cousin Tamatoa VI who submitted to French rule in 1888. In response, she and the minor chief Teraupo'o led a resistance government during the Raiatean rebellion (1887‚Äì1897) against the French. She unsuccessfully attempted to enlist the diplomatic support of the British by offering the islands to Queen Victoria and traveling to the British-controlled Cook Islands. The British refused to intervene. The rebellion ended with the surrender of Tuarii and her followers and the defeat and capture of Teraupo'o in 1897. She was pensioned off by the French colonial government and died in 1911.  Family  Tuarii was a younger daughter of King Tahitoe of Raiatea and Tahaa who ruled from 1871 to 1881.; ; ; Her grandfather Hihipa Tahitoe was the son of Vete'a-ra'i U'uru, the chief of Opoa, and grandson of King Tamatoa II of Raiatea from whom her family claimed the right to throne of Raiatea. In 1880, King Tahitoe accepted the provisional protectorate by French commissioner Isidore Chess√©. Tahitoe was deposed by his subjects for requesting the protectorate and his other daughter and successor Queen Tehauroa unsuccessfully attempted to enlist the protection of the British to preserve the independence of Raiatea in accordance with the Jarnac Convention of 1847. After Tehauroa's death in 1884, a civil war nearly broke out between two rivals for the throne. To avoid French intervention a female-line cousin and a junior member of the royal family of Huahine was installed as King Tamatoa VI.  Reign  Tuarii and her family at Avera, Queen Tuarii and her council of chiefs at Avera, On 16 March 1888, the French annexed Raiatea and Tahaa after formal negotiation between Great Britain and France ended the 1847 Convention. In either 1887 or 1888, Tuarii was installed on the throne by the rebel chief Teraupo'o in opposition to King Tamatoa VI who had sided with the French. Her government and the resistance movement was centered at the village of Avera, located on the eastern coast of Raiatea. The Raiateans unsuccessfully appealed to Robert Teesdale Simons, the British Consul in Tahiti, for assistance and offered their country to Queen Victoria or the \\"Great White Queen\\". In 1895, Queen Tuarii traveled to the British protectorate of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands to seek help from the British Resident Frederick Moss who refused to meet with her. The French appointed Governor Gustave Gallet to suppress the rebellion. Gallet had previous experience with suppressing the 1878 Kanak rebellion in New Caledonia. In 1896, two French warships, the cruiser and the transporter , arrived from New Caledonia with two hundred French soldiers to quell the native resistance. The invasion force was further reinforced with a company of Tahitian volunteers. On 27 December 1896, Governor Gallet attempted to parley with the rebels to avoid bloodshed. He set an ultimatum for the rebels to surrender by 1 January 1897. The rebel government at Avera under Queen Tuarii and 1700 rebels reluctantly surrendered. Teraupo'o and the rebels of Tahaa and the district of Tevaitoa refused the call to surrender and the rebellion ended after the rebel chief's capture after two months of guerilla warfare on 16 February 1897. The casualties of the six-week campaign were nearly fifty deaths mainly on the side of the Raiateans.  Later life and death  Tuarii was offered an annual pension of 2,400 francs, but the French refused her request for pensions for members of her family. The French governor wrote: \\"Je vous laisse d‚Äôailleurs le soin, si vous le jugez convenable, de pr√©venir Tuarii que si elle nous cr√©e la moindre difficult√© sa pension lui est retir√©e, car elle ne la doit qu‚Äô√† notre extr√™me bienveillance en sa faveur\\" or \\"I leave it to you, if you find it appropriate, to warn Tuarii that if she creates any sort of difficulty, her pension will be withdrawn, given that she is only allowed it thanks to our extreme benevolence towards her\\".

The events of the Palau de la M√∫sica took place in the Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana in Barcelona on 19 May 1960 during a celebration to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Catalan poet Joan Maragall. It was organised by the Orfe√≥ Catal√† and several ministers from the dictatorship attended. These events are considered to mark the revitalization of Catalan activism after the Spanish Civil War and the beginning of the political career of Jordi Pujol, who would eventually become President of the Generalitat de Catalunya. The importance of these events go far beyond from music, particularly because of the remarkable reaction of the public after the government banned the Cant de la Senyera from being sung at the event. The choir didn't sing El Cant de la Senyera, but the audience did. Jordi Pujol was among those arrested following the events. Even though he was not in the venue, he helped organise the protest and was found guilty by a military court and sent to prison.  Historical background and events  Franco's dictatorship always paid special attention to repressing any pro-Catalan expression, both of the Catalan language and the symbols of the country. However, after the regime's consolidation in the 50s the government planned some concessions sponsored by the mayor of Barcelona at the time, Josep Maria de Porcioles. They announced the concession of a Chart that would allow the city a certain level of self-government, the cession of the castle of Montju√Øc to the local council, a compellation of Catalan Civil Law, and the official celebration to mark the 100th anniversary of Catalan poet and writer Joan Maragall birthdate. Franco himself was to visit Catalonia earlier in May. These gestures became evidently a farce as the governor of Barcelona, Felipe Acedo Colunga, banned the Cant de la Senyera from being sung. Joan Maragall was in fact the author of the actual poem and it had been initially scheduled at the end of the event, as it traditionally was by the Orfe√≥ at the end of every concert. Activists from an organisation called Catalan Christians organised a protest that was to take place on the same day as the concert to celebrate Joan Maragall, 19 May 1960. This organisation was 6 hears old and had successfully contributed to the boycott of La Vanguardia in 1959. As soon as the event started, a group of young people stood up and started singing the Cant de la Senyera while spreading a particular anti-Franco cartoon that had been created as a reaction to Franco's visit to the city, that had taken place a few days earlier. The text had been written by Jordi Pujol himself. Several people were arrested and Jordi Pujol was sentenced to 7 years, although he only served three.

Originating from Semarang, Baswedan underwent police education and joined the police force in 1998, where he served in Bengkulu. In 2005, he left the organization and later joined KPK as an investigator. Baswedan was involved in several high-profile cases and was arrested by the Indonesian Police for some time. He was assaulted in 2017 through acid throwing, in a case that drew major national attention. Early life and education Baswedan was born in Semarang, Central Java, on 22 June 1977. During his early education, his family's economic situation necessitated him to work as a construction worker while studying in junior high school, though he had reportedly desired to become a police officer from his youth. After graduating from highschool in Semarang, he initially intended to enroll at a university in Surakarta, but cancelled it due to financial reasons and he instead joined the Police Academy. He graduated from the academy, and joined the police force, in 1998. Career =Police officer= After his graduation, Baswedan was assigned to Bengkulu, where he was involved in a number of cases including a forestry and an illegal gambling case. In 2004, he was promoted to head of the provincial police's criminal investigation agency. Four days after his promotion, an incident occurred where police officers under his command abused suspects in a theft case - Baswedan was investigated for ethical violations and later received a reprimand, though he remained in his office until October 2005. He was then reassigned to the criminal investigation agency for the central police headquarters. =KPK= In 2007, Polri's headquarters assigned Baswedan to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). At KPK, Baswedan handled several high-profile cases, including the arrest of for graft related to the 2011 Southeast Asian Games, a bribery case during the election of a deputy governor for Bank Indonesia, bribery of Constitutional Court chief justice Akil Mochtar, and others. Following a KPK investigation of alleged corruption within the police, which named a police general as suspect, Baswedan was investigated by the police in retaliation. On 5 October 2012, police officers (from Bengkulu) went to the KPK building in order to arrest Baswedan, accusing him of having conducted violence during interrogation procedures in the 2004 theft case. Within hours of the initial attempt, civilian activists formed a human chain around the KPK building in order to prevent police from arresting Baswedan, launched a social media campaign, and held demonstrations which successfully pressured President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to order the ceasing of Baswedan's investigation by the police and allow the police general to be prosecuted by KPK. Baswedan eventually submitted an early retirement from the police force in 2014. Despite the initial halting, the police announced that Baswedan's investigation had been resumed in February 2015. Novel did not respond to two summons that month (from which KPK's acting president had prohibited Baswedan from complying with) and he was arrested in his home on 1 May 2015. He was briefly detained, but he was released shortly afterwards and by 3 May he was giving interviews criticizing the police's actions, referring to them as a form of revenge. The Indonesian Ombudsman later published a recommendation which named maladministrative practices by the police during Baswedan's investigation, which included falsification of documents and deviation from procedure. =2017 attack and aftermath= On 11 April 2017, Baswedan was walking home from morning prayers at his local mosque in North Jakarta when two men threw acid at his face. The attack took place during a high-profile investigation into corruption in the Electronic Identity Card (e-KTP) project, which involved Speaker of the People's Representative Council Setya Novanto and other senior politicians. The attack left him blinded in one eye, and he underwent treatment in Singapore. After around three months of police investigations yielded no results, National Police Chief Tito Karnavian agreed to form a joint investigative team with KPK, following a meeting with President Joko Widodo. Baswedan returned from medical treatment in February 2018, and by July 2018 he had returned to his job as head of the investigation task force. Baswedan later said police were \\"not really serious in handling [his] case\\". After over two years of investigation, Widodo on 1 November 2019 gave a one-month deadline to newly appointed police chief Idham Azis to solve the Baswedan case. In late December that year, two active police officers, Rahmat Kadir Mahulette and Ronny Bugis, were arrested under suspicion of launching the assault. Baswedan said the two officers were scapegoats acting under orders from their superiors. At a court session on 11 June 2020, a state prosecutor recommended a one-year prison term for both suspects, The demand was widely condemned as being too lenient. On the night of 14 July 2020, North Jakarta District Court sentenced Mahulette to two years, while Bugis was jailed for 18 months. On 28 August 2020, Baswedan was tested positive for COVID-19 without having any symptoms. Family Baswedan is the grandson of journalist and politician Abdurrahman Baswedan, and is the first cousin of 17th Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan. He is married to Rina Emilda, and the couple has five children.

It contains an outcrop of Magnesian Limestone, exposed by former quarrying. 255 million years ago this limestone was the peripheral sediment of a tropical sea. The land was donated in 1945 to the people of Ripon by the town's mayor, Alderman Thomas Fowler Spence, a varnish manufacturer. The land was notified as an SSSI in 1986 because its calcareous grassland supported a large diversity of plant species. The site features a Schedule 8 protected plant, thistle broomrape. The land is protected as a nature reserve, and it is also managed as a recreational area. Therefore, its calcareous grass area is fenced off for protection and study, but it also contains a car park, information signs, a children's play area, accessible paths, benches, and dog waste bins. Site history The strata of the quarry face at the western side of the Quarry Moor site are the remains of a Permian shoreline of 255 million years past. Sediments from the tropical Zechstein Sea ultimately became the Magnesian Limestone outcrop of north-east England, part of which is exposed here. Limestone has been quarried here for at least six centuries, and used for construction. For example, in the 15th century the walls of the 12th century Chapel of St Mary Magdalen, Ripon, were refaced with blocks of limestone from Quarry Moor. By the 1870s there were lime kilns on the site, making quicklime for mortar. In September 1943, following the \\"use of land for army training,\\" botanist George Taylor reported: \\"Serious disturbance has been observed on Quarry Moor ... where last year Spiranthes spiralis Koch [or lady's tresses orchid] occurred in some quantity and the reappearance of this very local species on this site is problematical.\\" He checked the site again in 1944, and said, \\"The work of destruction has proceeded apace during the intervening months. The common is now almost completely excavated, and all vestige of plant life - except at the narrow margins - has disappeared.\\" As of 2020, the lady's tresses orchid is \\"becoming increasingly rare in the north of the UK.\\" The quarry was closed in the 1950s, and the pits were infilled in the 1970s. The infilling was carried out by the British Army, using 190 tonnes of stone supplied by Concrete4U and Lightwater Quarries. In this area there is water-soluble gypsum mixed with the limestone deposits, and the occasional collapse of cavities left by this gypsum layer has been blamed for the local sinkholes which have been appearing for centuries past. =Thomas Fowler Spence, donor= Quarry Moor is now held in trust for the Ripon people, having been donated in 1945 by Alderman T.F. Spence. The site then measured \\"to be kept for Ripon children for all time.\\" Thomas Fowler Spence (1878‚Äì1949) Births Sep 1878 Spence Thomas Fowler Ripon 9a 73 Deaths Mar 1949 Spence Thomas F. 70 Claro 2c 173 lived at Red Hills Grange, was Mayor of Ripon between 1927 and 1929, and was managing director of T.R.

It lies at the southern edge of Ripon, with an entrance on the west side of the A61 roundabout. Facilities include information boards, accessible paths, informal paths, benches, and dog toilet bins, besides a fenced-off wildflower meadow, and a children's play area in the north-east corner with a public car park. The site was notified on 1 May 1986, being of interest for the large number of plant species supported by the calcareous grassland habitat. The notified features of the site are the Schedule 8 protected plant, thistle broomrape, and the chalky grassland. The site was designated in 2001 as a Local Nature Reserve. It is one of a number of SSSIs in the Harrogate region. The others are Bishop Monkton Ings, Brimham Rocks, Cow Myers, Farnham Mires, Hack Fall Wood, Hay-a-Park, Kirk Deighton Mar Field Fen, and Ripon Parks. Quarry Moor is funded by Natural England, via Defra Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund, Harrogate Borough Council, Ripon City Partnership and (until 2012) Yorkshire Forward. As of 2019 it was cared for by the Alderman T.F. Spence Committee, which consists of six Ripon City councillors, and six members of the public. Significant site content =Flora= On the chalky grassland, alongside sheep's fescue and meadow oat- grass, grow rough hawkbit, hoary plantain, purging flax, thyme, glaucous sedge, yellow oat, quaking grass and red fescue. Among these are red bartsia, centaury, yellow-wort, bee orchid and felwort or autumn gentian. On other grassland here, the pH is more neutral, and the vegetation can grow more strongly. For example, there are various herbs: common spotted-orchid, great burnet, restharrow, marjoram, cowslip, hay rattle, greater burnet-saxifrage, basil, cross-wort, ox-eye daisy, knapweed, self-heal, lady's bedstraw, bird's-foot trefoil and primrose, all growing alongside slender false-broom and false-oat grass. Under the sycamore, wych elm, yew and ash in the wooded areas, goldilocks and sanicle can sometimes be found. More common there, are: dog's mercury, hairy St John's-wort, slender false-broom again, and wood avens. 20120816Karlsruher Str Hockenheim06.jpgwych elm Tistelsnultrot - Orobanche Reticulata (28).jpgThistle broomrape (protected plant) 20130616Bienen-Ragwurz7.jpgbee orchid 20150416Ranunculus auricomus1.jpggoldilocks 20170414Sanicula europaea3.jpgsanicle –ó—É–±—á–∞—Ç–∫–∞ –æ–±—ã–∫–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è 2.jpgred bartsia =Fauna= Quarry Moor's scrub provides a breeding site for whitethroat and willow warbler, summer visitors from Africa. The site also supports the resident treecreeper, wren and blackcap population. There is a bird feeding station and a bird hide in the south-east corner of the site. Insects breeding onsite include the brimstone butterfly, and the six-spot burnet moth, whose food plant is bird's-foot trefoil. Mammal sightings at Quarry Moor have included deer, vole, weasel and fox.

Light winter grazing is recommended, to prevent the dominance of scrub, and to achieve a \\"diverse mosaic of tall and short vegetation\\" in order to support biodiversity. Thus traditional hay cutting is carried out, and the grassland is grazed by ponies, cattle and native sheep such as Hebrideans. Fertiliser is not recommended because limestone grasslands support species which are adapted to low-nutrient habitats. Development and risk assessment When the calcareous grassland of this site was assessed for Natural England in 2011 it was judged to be in favourable condition, although the biodiversity was borderline, and scrub (hawthorn and ivy) was beginning to encroach on the grassland. The woodland area was judged favourable. English Nature has published a list of \\"operations likely to damage the special interest.\\" Item 27, Recreational or other activities likely to damage or disturb features of interest, may be pertinent since the park is also maintained for public recreational use. Natural England prohibits the picking of wild flowers, and the dropping of litter. Dogs are required to be kept on the lead, and dog litter bins are provided. Meanwhile, in point 9.2 of a letter granting a 2018 planning application for houses near the SSSI, a site assessor noted that dogs were being exercised on the protected calcareous grassland, dog waste was being left in situ, and \\"litter, vandalism and degradation are also frequent.\\" References External links  Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in North Yorkshire Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1986 ","title":"Quarry Moor"},{"id":"62683248","text":"James Levine's 25th Anniversary Metropolitan Opera Gala was a concert, lasting (including intermissions) approximately eight hours, that the Metropolitan Opera staged in 1996 in honour of its then principal conductor and Artistic Director. Excerpts from the gala were released by Deutsche Grammophon on a 72-minute CD, a 161-minute VHS videocassette and a 161-minute double Laserdisc in 1996, and on a 293-minute double DVD in 2005. Background James Levine made his d√©but at the Metropolitan Opera at the age of twenty-seven. On 5 June 1971, he conducted a matin√©e performance of Tosca with Grace Bumbry in the title role, Franco Corelli as Cavaradossi and Peter Glossop - also making his Met d√©but - as Scarpia. Levine was the longest serving conductor in the Met's history, becoming its Principal Conductor in 1973, its Music Director in 1976 and its inaugural Artistic Director in 1986. At the time of his gala, he had led the Met in 1,646 performances of sixty-eight operas, twenty-one of which he had introduced into the company's repertoire. He had also notably initiated the Met's series of television broadcasts with a production of La Boh√®me starring Luciano Pavarotti and Renata Scotto in 1977. The Met celebrated the silver anniversary of Levine's arrival there with a concert on 27 April 1996. Fifty-eight soloists contributed to a gala that lasted from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. on the following morning. They performed on three sets: an Ezio Frigerio design for Act 1 of Francesca da Rimini, a gift of Mrs Donald D. Harrington; a G√ºnther Schneider-Siemssen design for Act 2 of Arabella, a gift in part of Mrs Michael Falk; and a Schneider-Siemssen design for Act 2 of Tannh√§user, a gift of the Fan Fox and Leslie R. Samuels Foundation and of the Metropolitan Opera Guild. The gala as a whole was sponsored by Mrs Emily Fisher Landau.

It was not until the early hours, he wrote, that the Met's audience heard Birgit Nilsson paying tribute to James Levine with a few bars of \\"Ho-jo-to-ho\\" from her signature role, Br√ºnnhilde. Despite the absence of some singers, like Ben Heppner, due to scheduling clashes, and of others, like Cecilia Bartoli and Luciano Pavarotti, due to health issues, the concert was a \\"thrilling, if exhausting spectacle\\" replete with vocal talent. The gala's cast list ranged from veterans like the 71-year-old Carlo Bergonzi to newcomers like the 32-year-old Roberto Alagna. Alagna was more impressive than he had been in a recent La Boh√®me. His contributions to the Pearlfishers' Duet and the Cherry Duet from L'amico Fritz were both lovely. Two other young tenors - Jerry Hadley and Richard Leech - both sang well too, but no other representatives of their peer group put in an appearance: instead the Met heard the elderly Bergonzi and Alfredo Kraus and the 55-year-old Pl√°cido Domingo, as suave as usual in a trio from Ernani and a duet from Faust. Bryn Terfel displayed his \\"ebullient\\" Leporello in addition to duetting with Alagna in Bizet, his \\"booming, mellifluous baritone and utter ease and gracefulness as a performer [marking] him as one in a million\\". He was \\"sure to be one of the superstars of the next generation\\". The best of the evening's female singers was Ren√©e Fleming, \\"whose soprano voice is as beautiful as any in memory\\". She was luminous in Louise and Der Rosenkavalier, abetted in the latter by gorgeous singing from Heidi Grant Murphy and Anne Sofie von Otter. Her inclusion in a sextet from Don Giovanni made her the only soloist to be heard more than twice. Wagner enthusiasts would undoubtedly be encouraged by the Immolation Scene from G√∂tterd√§mmerung delivered by Jane Eaglen, a British dramatic soprano whose recent success in Wagner in Chicago had evidently not been a flash in the pan. She was worthy to share a billing with Birgit Nilsson. On the last occasion on which Nilsson had appeared at the Met, in its 1983 Centennial Gala, she had sung Isolde's Narrative and Curse. In the Levine gala, that was the passage offered by Waltraud Meier. Her performance was \\"thrilling\\", but she was a mezzo-soprano venturing into soprano territory, and the stress evident in her highest notes made one anxious as to whether she was pursuing a path that was right for her. Dawn Upshaw was \\"typically simple, silvery and winning\\" in Mozart's \\"Deh! Vieni, non tardar\\". \\"The contrast could not have been more striking with the number that preceded it - a mannered, diva-ish rendition by Jessye Norman, with high notes that consistently went flat, of an aria from Berlioz's Damnation of Faust\\". Levine did not avail himself of the opportunity to make any speeches, but merely \\"conducted the Met's wonderful orchestra with love and enthusiasm\\". Tim Page reviewed the gala in The Washington Post on 29 April 1996. It was, he wrote, a \\"glorious, crazy, songful party\\". Not all the most distinguished opera singers were present: Jos√© Carreras had a previous commitment, Montserrat Caball√©, Marilyn Horne and Teresa Stratas were ill and Kathleen Battle had been fired from the Met in 1994. But the concert still presented an astonishing constellation of some of opera's brightest stars. Dominated by Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, the gala's programme was typical of the repertoire of the Levine era but lacked any unifying theme otherwise. It was \\"a sort of melodious circus - a celestial vaudeville\\". There were consequently many awkward transitions. For example, Jane Eaglen's noble rendition of the immolation scene from G√∂tterd√§mmerung was followed by the broad comedy of Frederica von Stade in the tipsy aria from La P√©richole; the effect was to \\"dissipate the solemn afterglow of the one and make the other seem goofy and tasteless\\". Von Stade also supplied \\"one of the evening's true glories\\" in a performance of Cherubino's \\"Voi che sapete\\" [omitted from DG's DVD and CD]. \\"Opera has recently offered little more wonderful than von Stade's interpretation of that famous ardent, hormone- crazed pubescent boy\\". Also outstanding were Carlo Bergonzi and Alfredo Kraus, skillfully making the most of resources depleted by old age; Ileana Cotrubas, \\"ripely and irresistibly nostalgic\\" in Giuditta; Pl√°cido Domingo, combining \\"magnificent vocalizing and the most acute artistic intelligence\\" in Don Carlo and Faust; Ren√©e Fleming, \\"luscious and immaculate\\" in Louise, Don Giovanni and Der Rosenkavalier; Waltraud Meier, singing Isolde's curse with \\"thrilling ferocity\\"; and Ruth Ann Swenson, compensating for her technical deficiencies in a coloratura showpiece from Rom√©o et Juliette with character and intelligence. There were disappointments too. H√•kan Hageg√•rd and Karita Mattila were guilty of \\"campy snickering\\" in Die Fledermaus. Jerry Hadley perpetrated \\"vulgar Mario Lanza-isms\\" in The land of smiles [also omitted by DG]. Ghena Dimitrova, Franco Farina and Juan Pons were \\"third-rate\\" in Un ballo in maschera. And Sharon Sweet's mere appearance at the gala was \\"difficult to explain\\". Of especial interest were two prominent up and coming artists, Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu [appearing one day after their wedding]. Alagna had \\"a light, sweet and supple voice of moderate size (some high notes that were both delicate and ringing) and a not inconsiderable dramatic ability\\", but it was far to soon to bracket him with Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti. Gheorghiu was much more impressive, with \\"a voice of unusual and haunting timbre, a distinctive creative personality [and] attention to the sheer phonic sound of the words she sings\\". None of the soloists, though, could outshine the orchestra and their conductor. Thanks to Levine, the Met's pit was home to \\"one of the most responsive and virtuosic ensembles in the world\\", and it was remarkable that he could \\"preside so effortlessly and so idiomatically over such a range of musical styles, over so many hours\\". Martin Bernheimer reviewed the gala in The Los Angeles Times on 29 April 1996. It was, he wrote, a \\"mega-monster concert\\", a \\"shameless, shapeless, formless smorgasbord of arias and ensembles\\", \\"a parade of disparate singers striking poses in competitive evening attire\\" in which \\"the assembled women blew a crescendo of kisses to their beaming boss out front\\". The gala began with a somewhat lethargic treatment of the overture to Rienzi. Newlyweds Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu were clear, refined and sugary in the Cherry Duet from L'amico Fritz. Dolora Zajick sang with \\"full-throated bravura\\" in Eboli's \\"O don fatale\\". Waltraud Meier was incandescent in Isolde's Narrative and Curse. Carlo Bergonzi was touching and elegant in Luisa Miller. Alfredo Kraus amazed with his suavity and staying power as Werther and Hoffmann. Raymond Gniewek played an exquisite violin solo in I Lombardi. Catherine Malfitano and Dwayne Croft provided one of the evening's most successful passages of authentic music drama in a pyrexic scene from Eugene Onegin. Jane Eaglen, \\"a Wagnerian diva straight from a New Yorker cartoon\\", showed that it did not much matter what Br√ºnnhilde looked like if she had a voice as overwhelming as a tsunami. Sharon Sweet was \\"strident\\" in La forza del destino. Frederica von Stade demonstrated that \\"charm conquers all\\" with \\"her still boyish Cherubino and irresistibly tipsy P√©richole\\". Karita Mattila and Hak√•n Hageg√•rd were almost as seductive in a flirtatious Watch Duet from Die Fledermaus. Birgit Nilsson provided the gala's most exhilarating tribute to Levine with a trumpet-like Valkyrie war-cry. Pl√°cido Domingo and Samuel Ramey were comfortingly stellar in \\"Faust\\", Ramey for once being allowed to perform without baring his chest. Deborah Voigt, Bryn Terfel, Ruth Ann Swenson, Aprile Millo and Gabriela Be≈àaƒçkov√° were equally impressive in their celestial wattage. As far as clothing was concerned, the contributors most deserving of an award were Ileana Cotrubas for sporting a \\"gigantic Christmas bow\\", Mark Oswald for losing his tie and vest in Don Pasquale and \\"the various cleavage divas who lent new meaning to the concept of heaving bosoms\\". Jessye Norman perpetrated the evening's \\"most mannered\\" selection in a \\"crooned, roared and sighed\\" performance of \\"D'amour l'ardente flamme\\" that was so erratic in pitch as to present Berlioz as bitonal. Grace Bumbry was a wobbly old Dalila, and Gwyneth Jones an even wobblier Turandot. Dawn Upshaw's eloquent ornamentation in a \\"silver-bell\\" \\"Deh! Vieni, non tardar\\" was jarringly followed by the Jerry Hadley slathering on the schmalz in \\"Dein ist mein ganzes Herz\\". Maria Ewing \\"yowled\\" Gershwin's \\"My man's gone now\\" with her hands rather oddly thrust into her pockets. Kiri Te Kanawa's honeyed performance of an aria from Don Giovanni was accompanied by \\"comic-vamp routines\\". Ghena Dimitrova, Franco Farina and Juan Pons sang a trio from Un ballo in maschera as though working in some theatre in the provinces. Ren√©e Fleming provided the most beautiful vocalism of the entire concert in her excerpts from Louise and Der Rosenkavalier. James Morris, on the other hand, raised concerns for the health of his voice by the way in which he delivered Wotan's Farewell in his \\"fraying basso\\". James Levine's guidance of his excellent orchestra was \\"sympathetic if sometimes loud and sometimes inflexible\\". Neil Crory reviewed the gala on Laserdisc in the Fall 1997 issue of Opera Canada. It was, he wrote, \\"the gala-to-end-all-galas\\". Its programme booklet's cancellation list alone deserved a mention in The Guinness Book of Records, with Cecilia Bartoli, Hildegard Behrens, Nicolai Ghiaurov, Marilyn Horne and Luciano Pavarotti all pleading illness. The gala had not been consistent in quality. There were \\"a few blazing performances\\", but also \\"many that merely smouldered and others that simply failed to ignite\\". Happily, some of the evening's better selections had been preserved on DG's video discs. Deborah Voigt was \\"radiant\\" in \\"Dich teure Halle\\". Ren√©e Fleming was \\"stunning\\" in both Der Rosenkavalier and an \\"expressive, detailed\\" excerpt from Louise. Ruth Ann Swenson was \\"appropriately sun-filled\\" in the Waltz Song from Rom√©o et Juliette. Frederica von Stade - a perennial Met darling - was \\"hysterically funny\\" in the tipsy aria from La P√©richole. And in a \\"forthright\\" \\"O don fatale\\", Dolora Zajick brought the house down. J. B. Steane reviewed the CD of the gala in Gramophone in December 1998. \\"Out come the stars,\\" he wrote, \\"one by one or two by two and then six of them in a galaxy. Some have been in the firmament a long time, others are almost new. But all are there ... to pay tribute\\".Steane, J. B.: Gramophone, December 1996, p. 154 There was no doubt that the gala must have been a delightful celebration, but the wisest rule for such events was to record them in one's memory rather than on tape. This was not to say that the CD was without merit. Ren√©e Fleming sang really beautifully in \\"Depuis le jour\\" from the line \\"Au jardin de mon c≈ìur\\" onwards, and Ruth Ann Swenson essayed a brave and fruitful soft passage half way through Juliet's waltz. But the album's senior contributors sounded below their best, and even their younger colleagues never rose to real greatness. It was possible that this was partly to do with the disc's audio quality. Fleming's and Bryn Terfel's voices did not sound as attractive on the CD as they did when heard in person. Indeed, the playing of the Met orchestra was more enjoyable to listen to than any of the singers, and both were surpassed by the album's closing speech by Birgit Nilsson. After explaining how Swedes customarily behaved on such occasions, she said: \\"'But since I am a daughter of the Vikings, I will do it my way.' Then, with no more than a second's pause and no more than a semitone's adjustment of pitch, she gives vent to a mighty 'Hojotoho', and her top B-flat brings down the house\\". The gala was also discussed in Clyde T. McCants's American opera singers and their recordings.McCants, Clyde T.: American opera singers and their recordings, McFarland & Company, 2004, p. 381 Broadcast and home media history The gala was televised in a live transmission on PBS, and was also broadcast in Australia, Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In 1996, Deutsche Grammophon released versions of the gala in three formats. Thirteen excerpts were released on a 72-minute CD (catalogue number 449-177-2), accompanied by a 24-page insert booklet with an essay by Cory Ellison in English, French, German and Italian, and with production photographs of Alagna, Terfel, Fleming, Domingo, Ramey, Cotrubas, Zajick, Te Kanawa, Hong, Hadley, Robbins, Swenson, Mattila, Hageg√•rd, Kraus, Bumbry, Voigt, von Stade, von Otter, Murphy, Nilsson and Levine. Twenty excerpts were issued on a 161-minute pair of CLV (constant linear velocity) CX-encoded Laserdiscs (catalogue number 072-551-1) with 4:3 NTSC colour video and digital audio. The same excerpts were issued on a VHS videocassette (catalogue number 072-451-3) with 4:3 PAL colour video and digital audio.James Levine's 25th Anniversary Metropolitan Opera Gala, conducted by James Levine, Deutsche Grammophon VHS, 072-451-3, 1996 In 2005, Deutsche Grammophon released thirty- three excerpts from the gala on a 293-minute pair of DVDs (catalogue number B0004602-09), with 4:3 NTSC colour video and audio in PCM stereo and an ersatz 5.1-channel surround sound upmix in both DTS and Dolby Digital. The DVDs include an interview with Levine, a picture gallery and trailers, and are accompanied by a 12-page insert booklet with an essay by Kenneth Chalmers in English only. They omit the contributions made to the gala by Maria Ewing, Gwyneth Jones, Richard Leech, Jessye Norman and Sharon Sweet, as well as an excerpt from Werther sung by Alfredo Kraus that can be heard on Deutsche Grammophon's CD.

It is a parasitic plant whose host is normally the creeping thistle. It is native to the lowlands of Western Europe and Central Asia, but in the United Kingdom it is a rare and protected plant, growing only in Yorkshire, on grassland sites such as Quarry Moor. Description Orobanche reticulata was described by taxonomist Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth (Wallr.) in 1825. Its usual host plant is creeping thistle. It is a herbaceous and self-supporting plant with simple broad, scale-like leaves, normally growing up to , and it flowers between May and July. It is a tuberous perennial, a hermaphrodite plant which possibly germinates in the spring. It has a yellow-purple stem. The two-lipped flowers, measuring 15‚Äì25 mm (0.6‚Äì1 inch), have dark spots and purple stigmas. However, for full identification, the host must be noted. Distribution and range In general it is a lowland plant which grows on the edges of rivers and roads, and on floodplains, preferring grassland. In the United Kingdom it prefers dry, calcareous soil without shade, and an altitude of 100‚Äì150 metres (328‚Äì492 feet). It is possibly water-dispersed in some cases. It is a plant of temperate climates, native to the lowlands of Western Europe and Central Asia. In Belgium and Northern France its range is 10‚Äì30%; in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands 30‚Äì60%. =Orobanche reticulata in the United Kingdom= Orobanche reticulata is native and stable in the UK, where it is also known as Yorkshire broomrape. It is however a rare plant there, having been notified as a protected plant under Schedule 8. It grows only in Yorkshire, where it appears mainly in the Magnesian Limestone zone, but also at Wharram Quarry. At Wharram it has a \\"good population\\" of up to 224 flower spikes (2017), parasitising woolly thistle, and can grow quite tall there (up to ) although it may have been introduced artificially. At Hetchell Wood 117 flower spikes were recorded in 2015, and at Ripon Loop 77 spikes were recorded in 2014. In 2004 it was found at North Grimston. It was notified in 1989 on Hook Moor SSSI, where Natural England suggests that rabbit activity is beneficial to the survival of this plant. It grows at Quarry Moor, which was notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1986, partly because it featured O. reticulata. It is also found on some road verges in Yorkshire. Research In 1998 the Broomrape Conservation Workshop was actively monitoring O. reticulata across Yorkshire.

Transparency of algorithms Many people have complained that algorithms often cannot be inspected, to ensure that they are operating in a fair way, that cannot disadvantage some users.

Eventually algorithms may become more highly regulated, but currently there is little public oversight for them.  Fairness criteria in classification problemsSolon Barocas; Moritz Hardt; Arvind Narayanan, Fairness and Machine Learning. Retrieved 15 December 2019.  In classification problems, an algorithm learns a function to predict a discrete characteristic Y , the target variable, from known characteristics X . We model A as a discrete random variable which encodes some characteristics contained or implicitly encoded in X that we consider as sensitive characteristics (gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc.). We finally denote by R the prediction of the classifier. Now let us define three main criteria to evaluate if a given classifier is fair, that is, if its predictions are not influenced by some of these sensitive variables. = Independence = We say the random variables (R,A) satisfy independence if the sensitive characteristics A are statistically independent to the prediction R , and we write R \\\\bot A . We can also express this notion with the following formula: P(R = r  A = a) = P(R = r  A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall r \\\\in R \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A This means that the probability of being classified by the algorithm in each of the groups is equal for two individuals with different sensitive characteristics. Yet another equivalent expression for independence can be given using the concept of mutual information between random variables, defined as I(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y) In this formula, H of the random variable. Then (R,A) satisfy independence if H(R,A) = 0 . A possible relaxation of the independence nce definition include introducing a positive slack P(R = r  A = a) \\\\geq P(R = r  A = b) - \\\\epsilon \\\\quad \\\\forall r \\\\in R \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A Finally, another possible relaxation is to require I(R,A) \\\\leq \\\\epsilon . = Separation = We say the random variables (R,A,Y) satisfy separation if the sensitive characteristics A are statistically independent to the prediction R given the target value Y , and we write R \\\\bot A  Y . We can also express this notion with the following formula: P(R = r  Y = q, A = a) = P(R = r  Y = q, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall r \\\\in R \\\\quad q \\\\in Y \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A This means that the probability of being classified by the algorithm in each of the groups is equal for two individuals with different sensitive characteristics given that they actually belong in the same group (have the same target variable). Another equivalent expression, in the case of a binary target rate, is that the true positive rate and the false positive rate are equal (and therefore the false negative rate and the true negative rate are equal) for every value of the sensitive characteristics: P(R = 1  Y = 1, A = a) = P(R = 1  Y = 1, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A P(R = 1  Y = 0, A = a) = P(R = 1  Y = 0, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A Finally, another possible relaxation of the given definitions is to allow the value for the difference between rates to be a positive number lower than a given slack (R,A,Y) satisfy sufficiency if the sensitive characteristics A are statistically independent to the target value Y given the prediction R , and we write Y \\\\bot A  R . We can also express this notion with the following formula: P(Y = q  R = r, A = a) = P(Y = q  R = r, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall q \\\\in Y \\\\quad r \\\\in R \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A This means that the probability of actually being in each of the groups is equal for two individuals with different sensitive characteristics given that they were predicted to belong to the same group. = Relationships between definitions = Finally, we sum up some of the main results that relate the three definitions given above: * If A and Y are not statistically independent, then sufficiency and independence cannot both hold. * Assuming Y is binary, if A and Y are not statistically independent, and R and Y are not statistically independent either, then independence and separation cannot both hold. * If (R,A,Y) as a joint distribution has positive probability for all its possible values and A and Y are not statistically independent, then separation and sufficiency cannot both hold. MetricsSahil Verma; Julia Rubin, Fairness Definitions Explained. Retrieved 15 December 2019 Most statistical measures of fairness rely on different metrics, so we will start by defining them. When working with a binary classifier, both the predicted and the actual classes can take two values: positive and negative. Now let us start explaining the different possible relations between predicted and actual outcome:Confusion matrix * True positive (TP): The case where both the predicted and the actual outcome are in a positive class. * True negative (TN): The case where both the predicted outcome and the actual outcome are assigned to the negative class. * False positive (FP): A case predicted to be fall into a positive class assigned in the actual outcome is to the negative one. * False negative (FN): A case predicted to be in the negative class with an actual outcome is in the positive one. These relations can be easily represented with a confusion matrix, a table that describes the accuracy of a classification model. In this matrix, columns and rows represent instances of the predicted and the actual cases, respectively. By using this relations, we can define multiple metrics which can be later used to measure the fairness of an algorithm: * Positive predicted value (PPV): the fraction of positive cases which were correctly predicted out of all the positive predictions. It is usually referred to as precision, and represents the probability of a correct positive prediction. It is given by the following formula: PPV = P(actual=+prediction=+) = \\\\frac{TP}{TP+FP} * False discovery rate (FDR): the fraction of positive predictions which were actually negative out of all the positive predictions. It represents the probability of an erroneous positive prediction, and it is given by the following formula: FDR = P(actual=-prediction=+) = \\\\frac{FP}{TP+FP} * Negative predicted value (NPV): the fraction of negative cases which were correctly predicted out of all the negative predictions. It represents the probability of a correct negative prediction, and it is given by the following formula: NPV = P(actual=-prediction=-) = \\\\frac{TN}{TN+FN} * False omission rate (FOR): the fraction of negative predictions which were actually positive out of all the negative predictions. It represents the probability of an erroneous negative prediction, and it is given by the following formula: FOR = P(actual=+prediction=-) = \\\\frac{FN}{TN+FN} * True positive rate (TPR): the fraction of positive cases which were correctly predicted out of all the positive cases. It is usually referred to as sensitivity or recall, and it represents the probability of the positive subjects to be classified correctly as such. It is given by the formula: TPR = P(prediction=+actual=+) = \\\\frac{TP}{TP+FN} * False negative rate (FNR): the fraction of positive cases which were incorrectly predicted to be negative out of all the positive cases. It represents the probability of the positive subjects to be classified incorrectly as negative ones, and it is given by the formula: FNR = P(prediction=-actual=+) = \\\\frac{FN}{TP+FN} * True negative rate (TNR): the fraction of negative cases which were correctly predicted out of all the negative cases. It represents the probability of the negative subjects to be classified correctly as such, and it is given by the formula: TNR = P(prediction=-actual=-) = \\\\frac{TN}{TN+FP} * False positive rate (FPR): the fraction of negative cases which were incorrectly predicted to be positive out of all the negative cases. It represents the probability of the negative subjects to be classified incorrectly as positive ones, and it is given by the formula: FPR = P(prediction=+actual=-) = \\\\frac{FP}{TN+FP}  Other fairness criteria  Relationship between fairness criteria as shown in Barocas et al. The following criteria can be understood as measures of the three definitions given in the first section, or relaxation of them. In the table to the right, we can see the relationships between them. To define these measures specifically, we will divide them into three big groups as done in Verma et al.: definitions based on a predicted outcome, on predicted and actual outcomes, and definitions based on predicted probabilities and the actual outcome. We will be working with a binary classifier and the following notation: S refers to the score given by the classifier, which is the probability of a certain subject to be in the positive or the negative class. R represents the final classification predicted by the algorithm, and its value is usually derived from S , for example will be positive when S is above a certain threshold. Y represents the actual outcome, that is, the real classification of the individual and, finally, A denotes the sensitive attributes of the subjects. = Definitions based on predicted outcome = The definitions in this section focus on a predicted outcome R for various distributions of subjects. They are the simplest and most intuitive notions of fairness. * Group fairness, also referred to as statistical parity, demographic parity, acceptance rate and benchmarking. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal probability of being assigned to the positive predicted class. This is, if the following formula is satisfied: P(R = +A = a) = P(R = +A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * Conditional statistical parity. Basically consists in the definition above, but restricted only to a subset of the attributes. In mathematical notation this would be: P(R = +L = l, A = a) = P(R = +L = l, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A \\\\quad \\\\forall l \\\\in L = Definitions based on predicted and actual outcomes = These definitions not only considers the predicted outcome R but also compare it to the actual outcome Y . * Predictive parity, also referred to as outcome test. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal PPV. This is, if the following formula is satisfied: P(Y = +  R = +, A = a) = P(Y = +  R = +, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A : Mathematically, if a classifier has equal PPV for both groups, it will also have equal FDR, satisfying the formula: P(Y = -  R = +, A = a) = P(Y = -  R = +, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * False positive error rate balance, also referred to as predictive equality. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have aqual FPR. This is, if the following formula is satisfied: P(R = +  Y = -, A = a) = P(R = +  Y = -, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A : Mathematically, if a classifier has equal FPR for both groups, it will also have equal TNR, satisfying the formula: P(R = -  Y = -, A = a) = P(R = -  Y = -, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * False negative error rate balance, also referred to as equal opportunity. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal FNR. This is, if the following formula is satisfied: P(R = -  Y = +, A = a) = P(R = -  Y = +, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A : Mathematically, if a classifier has equal FNR for both groups, ti will also have equal TPR, satisfying the formula: P(R = +  Y = +, A = a) = P(R = +  Y = +, A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * Equalized odds, also referred to as conditional procedure accuracy equality and disparate mistreatment. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal TPR and equal FPR, satisfying the formula: P(R = +  Y = y, A = a) = P(R = +  Y = y, A = b) \\\\quad y \\\\in \\\\\\\\{+,-\\\\\\\\} \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * Conditional use accuracy equality. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal PPV and equal NPV, satisfying the formula: P(Y = y  R = y, A = a) = P(Y = y  R = y, A = b) \\\\quad y \\\\in \\\\\\\\{+,-\\\\\\\\} \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * Overall accuracy equality. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subject in the protected and unprotected groups have equal prediction accuracy, that is, the probability of a subject from one class to be assigned to it. This is, if it satisfies the following formula: P(R = Y , A = a) = P(R = Y  A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * Treatment equality. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have an equal ratio of FN and FP, satisfying the formula: \\\\frac{FN_{A=a}}{FP_{A=a}} = \\\\frac{FN_{A=b}}{FP_{A=b}} = Definitions based on predicted probabilities and actual outcome = These definitions are based in the actual outcome Y and the predicted probability score S . * Test- fairness, also known as calibration or matching conditional frequencies. A classifier satisfies this definition if individuals with the same predicted probability score S have the same probability to be classified in the positive class when they belong to either the protected or the unprotected group: P(Y = +S = s,A = a) = P(Y = +S = s,A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall s \\\\in S \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * Well-calibration is an extension of the previous definition. It states that when individuals inside or outside the protected group have the same predicted probability score S they must have the same probability of being classified in the positive class, and this probability must be equal to S : P(Y = +S = s,A = a) = P(Y = +S = s,A = b) = s \\\\quad \\\\forall s \\\\in S \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * Balance for positive class. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects constituting the positive class from both protected and unprotected groups have equal average predicted probability score S . This means that the expected value of probability score for the protected and unprotected groups with positive actual outcome Y is the same, satisfying the formula: E(SY = +,A = a) = E(SY = +,A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A * Balance for negative class. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects constituting the negative class from both protected and unprotected groups have equal average predicted probability score S . This means that the expected value of probability score for the protected and unprotected groups with negative actual outcome Y is the same, satisfying the formula: E(SY = -,A = a) = E(SY = -,A = b) \\\\quad \\\\forall a,b \\\\in A  Algorithms  Fairness can be applied to machine learning algorithms in three different ways: data preprocessing, optimization during software training, or post-processing results of the algorithm. = Preprocessing = Usually, the classifier is not the only problem; the dataset is also biased. The discrimination of a dataset D with respect to the group A = a can be defined as follows: disc_{A=a}(D) = \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{X\\\\in D X(A) eq a, X(Y) = +\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\{X \\\\in D  X(A) eq a \\\\\\\\}} - \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{X\\\\in D X(A) = a, X(Y) = +\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\{X \\\\in D  X(A) = a \\\\\\\\}} That is, an approximation to the difference between the probabilities of belonging in the positive class given that the subject has a protected characteristic different from a and equal to a . Algorithms correcting bias at preprocessing remove information about dataset variables which might result in unfair decisions, while trying to alter as little as possible. This is not as simple as just removing the sensitive variable, because other attributes can be correlated to the protected one. A way to do this is to map each individual in the initial dataset to an intermediate representation in which it is impossible to identify whether it belongs to a particular protected group while maintaining as much information as possible. Then, the new representation of the data is adjusted to get the maximum accuracy in the algorithm. This way, individuals are mapped into a new multivariable representation where the probability of any member of a protected group to be mapped to a certain value in the new representation is the same as the probability of an individual which doesn't belong to the protected group. Then, this representation is used to obtain the prediction for the individual, instead of the initial data. As the intermediate representation is constructed giving the same probability to individuals inside or outside the protected group, this attribute is hidden to the classificator. An example is explained in Zemel et al.Richard Zemel; Yu (Ledell) Wu; Kevin Swersky; Toniann Pitassi; Cyntia Dwork, Learning Fair Representations. Retrieved 1 December 2019 where a multinomial random variable is used as an intermediate representation. In the process, the system is encouraged to preserve all information except that which can lead to biased decisions, and to obtain a prediction as accurate as possible. On the one hand, this procedure has the advantage that the preprocessed data can be used for any machine learning task. Furthermore, the classifier does not need to be modified, as the correction is applied to the dataset before processing. On the other hand, the other methods obtain better results in accuracy and fairness.Ziyuan Zhong, Tutorial on Fairness in Machine Learning. Retrieved 1 December 2019  ReweighingFaisal Kamiran; Toon Calders, Data preprocessing techniques for classification without discrimination. Retrieved 17 December 2019  Reweighing is an example of a preprocessing algorithm. The idea is to assign a weight to each dataset point such that the weighted discrimination is 0 with respect to the designated group. If the dataset D was unbiased the sensitive variable A and the target variable Y would be statistically independent and the probability of the joint distribution would be the product of the probabilities as follows: P_{exp}(A = a \\\\wedge Y = +) = P(A = a) \\\\times P(Y = +) = \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{X \\\\in D  X(A) = a\\\\\\\\}}{D} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{X \\\\in D X(Y) = + \\\\\\\\}}{D} In reality, however, the dataset is not unbiased and the variables are not statistically independent so the observed probability is: P_{obs}(A = a \\\\wedge Y = +) = \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\{X \\\\in D  X(A) = a \\\\wedge X(Y) = +\\\\\\\\}}{D} To compensate for the bias, the software adds a weight, lower for favored objects and higher for unfavored objects. For each X \\\\in D we get: W(X) = \\\\frac{P_{exp}(A = X(A) \\\\wedge Y = X(Y))}{P_{obs}(A = X(A) \\\\wedge Y = X(Y))} When we have for each X a weight associated W(X) we compute the weighted discrimination with respect to group A = a as follows: disc_{A = a}(D) = \\\\frac{\\\\sum W(X) X \\\\in \\\\\\\\{X\\\\in D X(A) eq a, X(Y) = +\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\sum W(X) X \\\\in \\\\\\\\{X \\\\in D  X(A) eq a \\\\\\\\}} - \\\\frac{\\\\sum W(X) X \\\\in \\\\\\\\{X\\\\in D X(A) = a, X(Y) = +\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\sum W(X) X \\\\in \\\\\\\\{X \\\\in D  X(A) = a \\\\\\\\}} It can be shown that after reweighting this weighted discrimination is 0. =Optimization at training time= Another approach is to correct the bias at training time. This can be done by adding constraints to the optimization objective of the algorithm.Muhammad Bilal Zafar; Isabel Valera; Manuel G√≥mez Rodr√≠guez; Krishna P. Gummadi, Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment. Retrieved 1 December 2019 These constraints force the algorithm to improve fairness, by keeping the same rates of certain measures for the protected group and the rest of individuals. For example, we can add to the objective of the algorithm the condition that the false positive rate is the same for individuals in the protected group and the ones outside the protected group. The main measures used in this approach are false positive rate, false negative rate, and overall misclassification rate. It is possible to add just one or several of these constraints to the objective of the algorithm. Note that the equality of false negative rates implies the equality of true positive rates so this implies the equality of opportunity. After adding the restrictions to the problem it may turn intractable, so a relaxation on them may be needed. This technique obtains good results in improving fairness while keeping high accuracy and lets the programmer choose the fairness measures to improve. However, each machine learning task may need a different method to be applied and the code in the classifier needs to be modified, which is not always possible.

An important point here is that, in order to propagate correctly, \\\\hat{Y} above must refer to the raw output of the classifier, not the discrete prediction; for example, with an artificial neural network and a classification problem, \\\\hat{Y} could refer to the output of the softmax layer. Then we update U to minimize L_{A} at each training step according to the gradient abla_{U}L_{A} and we modify W according to the expression: abla_{W}L_{P} - proj_{ abla_{W}L_{A}} abla_{W}L_{P} - \\\\alpha abla_{W}L_{A} where \\\\alpha is a tuneable hyperparameter that can vary at each time step. Graphic representation of the vectors used in adversarial debiasing as shown in Zhan et al. The intuitive idea is that we want the predictor to try to minimize L_{P} (therefore the term abla_{W}L_{P} ) while, at the same time, maximize L_{A} (therefore the term \\\\- \\\\alpha abla_{W}L_{A} ), so that the adversary fails at predicting the sensitive variable from \\\\hat{Y} . The term -proj_{ abla_{W}L_{A}} abla_{W}L_{P} prevents the predictor from moving in a direction that helps the adversary decrease its loss function. It can be shown that training a predictor classification model with this algorithm improves demographic parity with respect to training it without the adversary. =Postprocessing= The final method tries to correct the results of a classifier to achieve fairness. In this method, we have a classifier that returns a score for each individual and we need to do a binary prediction for them. High scores are likely to get a positive outcome, while low scores are likely to get a negative one, but we can adjust the threshold to determine when to answer yes as desired. Note that variations in the threshold value affect the trade-off between the rates for true positives and true negatives. If the score function is fair in the sense that it is independent of the protected attribute, then any choice of the threshold will also be fair, but classifiers of this type tend to be biased, so a different threshold may be required for each protected group to achieve fairness. A way to do this is plotting the true positive rate against the false negative rate at various threshold settings (this is called ROC curve) and find a threshold where the rates for the protected group and other individuals are equal.Moritz Hardt; Eric Price; Nathan Srebro, Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning. Retrieved 1 December 2019 The advantages of postprocessing include that the technique can be applied after any classifiers, without modifying it, and has a good performance in fairness measures. The cons are the need to access to the protected attribute in test time and the lack of choice in the balance between accuracy and fairness.  Reject Option based ClassificationFaisal Kamiran; Asim Karim; Xiangliang Zhang, Decision Theory for Discrimination-aware Classification. Retrieved 17 December 2019  Given a classifier let P(+X) be the probability computed by the classifiers as the probability that the instance X belongs to the positive class +. When P(+X) is close to 1 or to 0, the instance X is specified with high degree of certainty to belong to class + or - respectively. However, when P(+X) is closer to 0.5 the classification is more unclear. We say X is a \\"rejected instance\\" if max(P(+X), 1-P(+X)) \\\\leq \\\\theta with a certain \\\\theta such that 0.5 < \\\\theta < 1 . The algorithm of \\"ROC\\" consists on classifying the non-rejected instances following the rule above and the rejected instances as follows: if the instance is an example of a deprived group (X(A) = a) then label it as positive, otherwise, label it as negative. We can optimize different measures of discrimination (link) as functions of \\\\theta to find the optimal \\\\theta for each problem and avoid becoming discriminatory against the privileged group.

She worked for the emancipation of women in Algeria. She advocated for the defence and promotion of the right to self-determination and against colonialism in Algeria.  Biography  = Early life = Born in 1920 in Algeria at the time when it was still a colony, she therefore had French nationality obtained by her father as a wounded veteran from the great war under the Clemenceau decree. Due to the perseverance of her father she schooled at the French school until she was 11 years old, at 14 she was married to her cousin who was 4 years older, under a customary arrangement where she acquired the name Baya Allaouchiche. She had three children in the marriage, of which one died at an early age. Her first struggle as a woman was to end a marriage she was forced into. After the struggles of her early life, she led activism about the gender inequalities at the time and for the independence of Algeria and for a more equitable world through her communist values. = Career = She was a member of the central committee of the Algerian Communist Party (PCA) clandestine, which advocated for the right of Algerian women and their independence. She was also the secretary of the Women's Union of Algeria where she represents her country at numerous international conferences of communist women. She participated in anti-fascist fight after the landing in North Africa. During the national liberation revolution of the Algerian people, in 1955, she organized demonstrations of women prisoners and was later imprisoned in France in 1956. In 1956 in Geneva, the French authorities forbid her to return to Algiers. She then settled in Marseille but she did not give up the struggle for independent Algeria, especially by serving as a relay to the FLN and support for French militants committed alongside Algerian fighters. In 1959 she met the founder of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of France, Jacques Jurquet, who was also an anti-colonialist and anti-racist, who would later become his companion. She worked on the destruction of slums and the defence of Marseille's immigrants against the National Front. During the Algerian civil war of the 1990s, she organized reception structures in Marseilles for communist orphans. She was elected general secretary of the Union of Algerian women in 1949 and member of the central committee of the Algerian Communist Party (PCA), which mobilizes various audiences in Kabyle, Arabic, and French, it remains in contact with the FLN. = Bibliography = \\\\- Algerian women: from the Kahina to the Family Code / Baya Jurquet-Bouhoune, Jacques Jurquet. - Le Temps des Cerises.Jurquet-Bouhoune, Baya, 1920-2007. et Impr.

She took drawing classes at the Gonz√°lez Allende Foundation, which was an institute affiliated to the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza (ILE, English: The Free Institution of Education), and published her first illustrations in the local newspaper, El Noticiero de Toro.P√°gina sobre la autora In 1925, her father sent her to Madrid to the school San Luis de los Franceses to study French, shorthand and dressmaking. The day after her arrival, she had her entrance exam for the School of Arts and Crafts. Her intention was to enter the School of Fine Arts, which she achieved in 1926. She was granted two scholarships for the first four years of her studies. During this time, she recognized that she did not learn any French, but she was able to enter the Academy of San Fernando. During the period of her studies, her scholarship funding was suspended and she decided to stay in Madrid and seek paid work. She presented her drawings to various journals, offering to collaborate, and began her professional career as an illustrator for journals such as Estampa, Cr√≥nica, Blanco y Negro, Nuevo Mundo and La Esfera. During the sixties, Tejero continued to publish her illustrations, including self-authored short stories in newspapers such as ABC and Ya. She lived in the Residencia de Se√±oritas (English: Ladies‚Äô Residence), run by Mar√≠a de Maetzu, for four years, where she met intellectuals and artists who would hold meetings there. She also established friendships with her roommates and their families such as the Valle-Incl√°n family, Josefina Carabias and Marina Romero. In October 1929, she was appointed a professor of drawing and fine arts at the Academy of San Fernando. That year, she decided to change her name, Adela, to Delhy inspired by the capital of India. In 1930, she received an Award of Appreciation at the National Exhibit of Fine Arts. From January to June of 1931, she studied mural techniques in Paris and Belgium. When she returned to Spain, she was named interim professor of the Academy of Arts and Crafts in Madrid. Tejero had her first studio in 1932, on Miguel Moya Street in Madrid. During the month of December, she held her first individual exhibit with mural projects, oil paintings in large formats and a collection of drawings with experimental techniques such as decalcomania for her witches series, a creation which was later attributed, in 1939, to Oscar Dom√≠nguez. =Avant-garde period= In 1934, she painted the work ‚ÄúMercado Zamorano‚Äù (English: Zamoran Market), which she presented in the National Exhibit dedicated to regional dresses. That same year, she obtained a scholarship from the Board of the Extension of Studies and left for Paris to study mural painting. In 1936, she spent her holidays in Morocco. She managed to return to Spain despite the outbreak of civil war, but it was not possible for her to reach Madrid and continue giving classes. She stayed in Toro, where she worked as a drawing teacher at the local high school. In 1937, she was appointed to paint the murals for lunch rooms in schools in Salamanca, and for the Condestable Hotel in Burgos. When she finished these commissions, she asked to travel to Florence where she would stay for two years. In 1939, she returned to Paris where she encountered the surrealist movement, especially with Oscar Dom√≠nguez and Andr√© Br√©ton. She took a painting course at the University of Sorbonne and a course in theosophy. She participated in the exhibition ‚ÄúLe R√™ve dans l‚Äôart et la litterature‚Äù alongside Mir√≥, Dom√≠nguez, Man Ray, Chagall, and others. =Spiritualist and transitional period= In August of 1939 Tejero returned to Spain. She installed herself in a studio in La Prensa, the building on Plaza del Callao in Madrid, and painted the ceiling of a cinema installed in the building. In 1943 she was awarded third place in the painting section of the National Exhibit. That same year, her father died. Through the religious circles led by Father C√©sar Vaca, who followed the Christian doctrines of Teilhard de Chardin, and by her contact with aristocrats such as Lil√≠ √Ålvarez, Tejero went through what she called her ‚Äúsecond mysticism‚Äù. During this time, her work lost all of its innovative quality and she destroyed the works she had created in Paris. In 1947, following a group show organized by the Spanish government in Buenos Aires, she progressively abandoned her mystic lines of work. She returned to painting the human figure but added her own personal style by fusing them together creating one form out of two, or two forms out of three. In 1948, she won the contest organized by the City Council of Zamora with her mural project El Amanecer jur√≠dico Zamorano (English: The Legal Dawn of Zamora). After 1951, she experienced a renaissance of the avant-garde tendencies towards abstraction. In 1953, she was the only woman to participate in the first abstract exhibition of Santander. The following exhibit was collective, in the Habana, in 1954. Her last exhibition was a solo show in the rooms of the Direction of Fine Arts in Madrid. = Death = In 1959 she suffered a myocardium heart attack. During the following years, she painted murals by commission and continued to paint and illustrate until October 10 1968, when she died from a heart attack in Madrid.

One aspect of the project is exploring the textile heritage of Katembe, led by Macamo. She has lectured internationally on Mozambique's cultural heritage. = 'Privileged Places' = A major focus of Macamo's research has been to put forward the theoretical framework of 'privileged places' and how it can be adapted for Mozambique. This research has focussed on places such as Manyikeni, Niamara, Songo and Degue-Mufa. Macamo was the first person to introduce gendered analysis into the consideration of the sites. Her work at Niamara recongised it as part of a pair of sites with Magure, where Nimara (on a hill) represents the male and Magure (in the valley) the female. This work focuses on pre-colonial identities based on not just the stone buildings, but access to communications, resources and other factors. = Director for Cultural Heritage = In 2007, whilst Deputy Director for Cultural Heritage, Macamo brought together Portuguese and Japanese expertise in heritage management to build a model to support the World Heritage Site, the Island of Mozambique. Much of her work of the Island has focused on how communities can be involved with protecting and interpreting their cultural heritage. During her time as Director she co-produced a report examining twenty years of progress on cultural heritage management in Mozambique, recognising its challenges and opportunities. Whilst in 2015 she was a delegate to UNESCO's 20th session of the General Assembly of States Parties. In 2017 Macamo shared the experience of building cultural practice in Mozambique with the \\"African Agendas\\" programme. In her work there she recognised the need for sustainability in their practice, the importance of cultural tourism and also that one of their top priorities is the preservation of the heritage of the country's armed struggle.

It is named after the first collection to which it belonged, the Marteau collection in Brussels, Belgium, although it is now in a private collection in Japan, belonging to the Agonsh≈´ sect of Buddhism. The Brussels Buddha belongs to the category of the \\"Seated Buddha triads\\", which can be seen contemporaneously in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara and in the art of Mathura in the early Kushan period. The precise location where the statue was discovered is unknown, but it was acquired in Peshawar, and it is thought to have been excavated in Sahri Bahlol due to its similarity with a statue from the same location, now in the Peshawar Museum. Characteristics In this statue, the seated Buddha is attended by Brahma and Indra, as well as two Bodhisattvas. The scene shows the \\"Miracle at ≈örƒÅvastƒ´\\". The statue is remarkable in that it is one the rare Gandhara Buddhist statues to bear a dedication with a date. The inscription in Kharoshti reads: The date \\"Year 5\\" should normally refer to the Kanishka era, now thought to start in 127 CE, giving a date of 132 CE. However, the advanced character of the iconography has led some authors to support a later date, based on a supposed second Kanishka era starting a century later or a theory according to which the hundreds would have been omitted from the date. Some much later dates have been suggested as well, for example a date in the Huna era of Khingila, which would give a period circa the 5th century CE, but such a date can be considered as too late. A date in the Gupta era has also been suggested, but there is no evidence of the Gupta era being used so far north. According to G√©rard Fussman, who analyzed the paleography of the inscription, there is no doubt that \\"Year 5\\" corresponds to the era of Kanishka I, as the shapes of several letters are typical of that period. The language of the inscription is a mix of Prakrit and Sanskrit. This dated sculpture suggests that the Greco- Buddhist art of Gandhara was already at a very advanced stage of sophistication at the beginning of the Kushan period, in the early 2nd century CE, implying the existence of a long preliminary tradition leading up to it.

From 1973 to 1978, he wrote a weekly column on technology for The New York Times. As a Nieman Fellow in 1962‚Äì1963, McElheny first met James D. Watson. The day after Watson received word from Stockholm that he would share in that year‚Äôs Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, he lectured in George Wald‚Äôs Natural Sciences 5 class about modern biology. McElheny happened to be in the front row. The occasion is described on pages 1 through 4 of McElheny's Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution, Perseus 2003 and paperback 2004. During his Nieman Fellowship year, McElheny did not attempt to interview Watson but did meet him several times at conferences in Europe while covering research and science policy there for Science magazine. The close acquaintance between McElheny and Watson, began at an early 1967 ceremony awarding the Rumford Premium of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to Princeton astrophysicist Robert H. Dicke, where Watson told McElheny of discoveries in the field of ‚Äúrepressor‚Äù proteins in his Harvard lab. McElheny did a story on this work by Walter Gilbert and Mark Ptashne for The Boston Globe early in 1967, and then did frequent stories on molecular biology, including a full page in The Boston Globe's Sunday edition about the June 1968 Symposium at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). This was just after Watson became CSHL director almost simultaneously with publication of The Double Helix and his marriage to Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Lewis. McElheny attended the literary lunch at the Century Association in New York City for The Double Helix, and a rock and roll party at Jim Watson's Cambridge, Massachusetts, home that in effect celebrated his engagement, and McElheny lunched with Jim and Liz shortly after their wedding. McElheny was several times at Cold Spring Harbor for scientific meetings and meals at the Watsons‚Äô home, and chaired public policy sessions at a 1976 conference on environmental sources of cancer. In 1978, McElheny left The New York Times after five years as the paper‚Äôs technology specialist to join Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as first director of the Banbury Center. He was charged with organizing approximately 20 conferences on environmental health risks, and publishing (as the chief editor) 12 books from the conferences. He worked under Watson‚Äôs supervision for four years. In subsequent years, McElheny has visited Cold Spring Harbor many times, particularly to do research for his 2003 biography Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution and also to gather material for his 2010 history of the Human Genome Project for Basic Books. Victor McElheny and his wife Ruth attended celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the double helix at the Waldorf Astoria New York in 2003, Watson‚Äôs 80th birthday in 2008, and his 90th in 2018. In 1982 McElheny joined MIT to create a fellowships program with funding from the Sloan Foundation and the Mellon Foundation; the fellowships program (MIT Knight Science Journal Fellowships) is administered by the Program in Science, Technology, and Society and was headed by McElheny from 1982 to 1998. As first director of what became the Knight Science Journalism program, he oversaw the program's permanent endowment through donations of $8.25 miliion over eight years from the Knight Foundation, supplemented by $2.5 million from other MIT donors to match the $5 million Knight endowment challenge. He is now a Research Affiliate at MIT's Program in Science, Technology, and Society. As of 2019, the endowed MIT program for science journalists was in its 37th year. Victor McElheny and his wife Ruth, along with a grant from the Rita Allen Foundation, funded MIT's Victor K. McElheny Award. Victor McElheny and Brenda Maddox were panelists at a 2003 symposium at the Centre for Life in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Her widely acclaimed book Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA had just appeared. According to Hilary Rose, Watson in his book The Double Helix \\"systematically stereotyped Franklin, making her out to be a bluestocking and a frump\\" and \\"this stereotyping enabled him to erase Franklin's crucial contribution of the X-ray photographs that confirmed the helical structure.\\" McElheny met Hilary Rose and her husband Steven in London in the 1960s and greatly enjoyed conversations in which McElheny's political differences with Hilary and Steven Rose were major. In his famous book, Watson, taking the part of Maurice Wilkins (who might have been a distant relative of Crick‚Äôs because Crick's mother's maiden name was Wilkins), took adolescent swipes at Rosalind Franklin in a book that was both designedly and inevitably indiscreet and adolescent. As usual in the real events forming the basis of history, the actuality is a bit embarrassing. However, Watson's The Double Helix conferred deserved and lasting fame on Franklin. In addition to his long acquaintanceship with Watson, McElheny, starting from the time when he worked for the Polaroid Corporation in 1972‚Äì1973, was personally acquainted with Polaroid's genius innovator Edwin H. Land for many years. Land died in 1991 and McElheny completed his biography of Land in 1998. In the later years of the decade of the 2010s, McElheny pursued his interest in \\"forced-draft national technological mobilizations, of the sort that would be needed to accelerate efforts to forestall at least some of the damage from global warming.\\" Selected publications * page 66 * (See DNA.) * (promotion of Drawing the Map of Life: Inside the Human Genome Project) References External links  * Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:Phillips Exeter Academy alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:American science writers Category:20th-century American journalists Category:21st-century American journalists Category:American biographers ","title":"Victor McElheny"},{"id":"62683493","text":"Halld√≥ra Vanda Sigurgeirsd√≥ttir (born 28 June 1965) is an Icelandic former multi-sport athlete who played both for the Icelandic national football team and the Icelandic national basketball team.

The Moors also hid some of their own cavalry in some nearby mountains. Solomon anticipated the trap and sent men to the side of the circle not facing the mountains. Due to the Moor formation these were not able to do much damage and when the Moors charged the fighting turned against them.

Definition  There is no official definition. Ofsted defines the practice: > Off-rolling is the practice of removing a pupil from the school roll without > using a permanent exclusion, when the removal is primarily in the best > interests of the school, rather than the best interests of the pupil. This > includes pressuring a parent to remove their child from the school roll. Process To the classroom teacher, the first they know is that a child is not in class anymore. Requests to the senior leadership team (SLT) for information give no response or details just that the parent has removed them. According to Ofsted, who also wished to know why the child is no longer there, and published a report on 9 May 2019, 24% of secondary teachers have experiences off-rolling, while an additional 51% had heard of it but not experienced it. Teachers are suspicious that off-rolling is taken place, when it occurs at key points in the year, when they have been recently asked for a behaviour report about the child or the child is a know low attender or low achiever. They are suspicious when the off-rolled child was being discusses for permanent exclusion. It is possible that transfer was genuine, but in a climate where the reasons aren't given, they assume that this is one of the pattern. Two techniques have been used, transferring the child who is already receiving help through an alternative provider (AP) such as a specialist behavioural or autism unit, fully onto the units roll. Persuading the parents that it is in everyone's interest if the child remains at home and is taught by the family or privately. When the school census is done and the statistics collated, the child's poor results will not depress the schools average. =Legitimate reasons to remove a child from the school roll= This is governed by the Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 ‚Äì Regulation 8. *AP - Alternative provision - The school pays an independent alternative provider to take the child. At first the child is dual-rolled, remaining on both rolls. Then there is a managed move, where the alternative provision takes totally responsibility for the child and the results that child achieves. The child is removed from the mainstream schools roll. If this is in the child's best interest this is fine, if it is not then it is off-rolling. *EHE - Elected Home Education - The parents undertake to educate the child at home. If this is initiated by the parents, and the headteacher made a reasonable attempt to point out how this may disadvantage the child, this is fine. If the parents have not been given the facts, or have been coerced to remove the child then this is off-rolling. * Moving house a distance away (usually 6 miles) so it is not reasonable to provide school transport. * Not returning to school after a holiday and being uncontactable - though this may cause other reasons for concern with girls from certain cultures. * Being out of contact with school and authorities for a period of 20 days. * Failing to transition from kindergarten (nursery / reception) to primary. * Changing schools with both schools approval. Prevalence At the end of 2018, Ofsted identified 300 schools where the numbers leaving the roll was abnormally high, it wouldn't name them but contacted their academy trust or controlling local authority. In June 2019, Ofsted failed Falmouth School where if found pupils had been removed ‚Äúagainst the wishes of the family, the advice of the local authority and the professional judgement of other agencies.‚Äù The inspection of The Sutton Academy, St Helens, which is overseen by the St Helens College, showed 12 pupils who were receiving education, through an AP in the dual-roll mode, were transferred to the AP, removing them from Sutton's roll. This practice had been going on, there and in other local schools with the knowledge of the local authority for several years. It has now stopped. Other schools criticised by Ofsted for off-rolling pupils are Harrop Fold School in Salford and the Shenley E-ACT Academy in Birmingham, both of which were put in special measures. The Discovery Academy, Stoke-on- Trent had it management rating downgraded on the personal intervention of Amanda Spielman. Philip Nye, working for FFT Education Datalab, explains that in total, 24,600 pupils disappeared from mainstream schools last year, leaving for unknown destinations. The previous year it was 22,000. These were students that had been there the year before and now were not. It is estimated that as many as 9,000 disadvantaged 16-year-olds were not taking exams or recorded in school league tables because they cannot be located on school records. Statistics Jason Bradbury, Ofsteds chief statistician, has identified certain trends. London is particularly badly affected.‚ÄòAcademies, particularly those in some multi-academy trusts, appear to be losing proportionately more pupils than local authority schools. Conversely, local authority schools seem to be taking on proportionately more pupils,‚Äô The Education Select Committee in July 2018 said that 'off-rolling is in part driven by school policies created by the Department for Education‚Äô. ‚ÄòThe Department cannot wash its hands of the issue, just as schools cannot wash their hands of their pupils.‚Äô Progress 8 incentivises exclusion; it detering schools from retaining pupils ‚Äòclassed as difficult or challenging‚Äô. The government under pressure, delegated the task of eliminating it to Ofsted. Ofsted rewrote its inspection quidelines, and as a consequence action started to be taken against high off- rollers. The message was that off-rolling was not transparent, where exclusion had a set of verifiable procedures so was fairer. The National Association of Head Teachers warn that the resulting confusion will unreasonably drive up the rate of permanent exclusions. Consequences When pupils are off-rolled, the consequences for them are severe: only around one per cent of children who leave to an alternative provision or a special school achieve the benchmark five good GCSEs. About 20,000 children leave the rolls of mainstream secondary schools to a range of other destinations: with only six per cent achieving five good GCSEs.

Biography Yohei Tadano's interest in acting began in his elementary school years. In 1981, while studying at the University of the Ryukyus, he joined the production \\"Audience Seats\\" at the Okinawa Jean Jean festival. After graduating from college, he worked most immediately as a salesman, but later became involved with a series of theater companies. Tadano joined the Theater Echo Training Institute in 1988, and two years later became a research student at the same entity. He was named a troupe member in April 1994 and was further promoted in April 2000. Tadano is currently active mainly on stage and in voice-over work. On February 27, 2019, he became Kitakyushu City's Tourism Ambassador. His first voice-over assignment was in 1993 with the Japanese- language dubbing of the American film The Saint of Fort Washington. Dubbing assignments for western movies continued for some time, but from 2006 Tadano expanded into anime, first for Hime-sama Goy≈çjin. He portrays characters ranging from young to old. He voiced Nucky Thompson in Boardwalk Empire and also performed as the comical villain King Candy in Wreck-It Ralph, Heinz Doofenshmirtz in Phineas and Ferb and Mr. Smee in Jake and the Never Land Pirates. Since his face physically resembles Tadao Futami, a senior member of a well-known theater company, Tadano took on the stage role of Futami. Because his voice shares some similarities with Yasuo Yamada, a senior troupe member, Tadano often substitutes for Yamada when required. When Ichir≈ç Nagai passed away in 2014, Tadano was called on to assume Nagai's role of Yoda in Star Wars Rebels. In Kingdom Hearts III, he also replaced Kaneta Kimotsuki in his role as Jiminy Cricket. Tadano additionally has also served as a replacement for Takeshi Aono.

Inspired by Der St√ºrmer, the newspaper made antisemitism its main theme and was also critical of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Denunciations published by the newspaper contributed to the isolation of Jews during the first years of the Holocaust in Bohemia and Moravia. Background Antisemitism and fascism, as represented in the newspaper, were the fringe of opinion among Czechs, but gained in popularity after the 1938 Munich Agreement forced Czechoslovakia to cede the Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. The paper's antecedent was another newspaper ≈†t√≠t n√°roda (Shield of the Nation), which started to publish soon after the German occupation of the Czech rump state in March 1939, which established the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Arijsk√Ω boj began to publish in May 1940, in tabloid format, publishing weekly on Saturdays. Its slogan was \\"Proti ≈Ωid≈Øm pravdou a ƒçiny!\\" (Against the Jews with truth and deeds). Inspired by Der St√ºrmer, the newspaper made antisemitism its main theme. In a letter to Emanuel Moravec, editor-in-chief Rudolf Nov√°k stated: \\"Our paper spreads throughout the Czech countryside an antidote against Bene≈°ite whispered propaganda... In a reporting fashion... we expose local Jew-lovers, Bene≈°ites, and the like.\\" It was the official organ of the Vlajka Czech fascist movement. Contributors Rudolf Nov√°k (1890‚Äì1947), who had been imprisoned in Austria-Hungary for his activism in the Czech National Social Party and served in the Czechoslovak Legion, was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper from early 1941. Nov√°k managed to increase the newspaper's circulation to 16,000 by employing a \\"ruthless, tabloid writing style\\". Jan Vladimir B≈ôeten√°≈ô, another ex-legionnaire fascist, was originally the publisher. However, he was arrested by the Gestapo in December 1940 and deported to Dachau concentration camp; ownership passed to his daughter, Olga. Other contributors included Vladim√≠r Krycht√°lek, Karel La≈ænovsk√Ω, and Emanuel Vajtauer. Content The main theme of the newspaper was antisemitism and criticism of \\"Jew-lovers\\". It also promoted Nazism and collaboration with the Nazis and criticized both the interwar Czechoslovak government and the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. In practice, this was two sides of the same coin because Arijsk√Ω boj claimed that the democratic Czechoslovak government had been nothing more than \\"little Palestine\\" and had been preceded by \\"Jew- Habsburg Austria\\". The government-in-exile was supposedly dominated by Jews, such as , the minister of justice, whose grandfather had converted to Christianity. Arijsk√Ω boj attacked celebrities and organizations which it felt were insufficiently enthusiastic about the German occupation, accusing other newspapers of keeping \\"two irons in the fire\\". Those with a \\"Janus head\\" were threatened with denunciation. Simultaneously, the newspaper promoted fascist and antisemitic associations. The first page contained criticism of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, often employing fabricated stories involving fictional mistresses. The article \\"Alice Masaryk's Harem\\" accuses the former president Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk's daughter of being a lesbian who kept a harem in Carpathian Ruthenia, while simultaneously having a fetish for Jewish men. The newspaper also published \\"bizarre antisemitic ramblings\\"; headlines included \\"Stalin: 'Slavic' Jew\\", \\"Jews ‚Äì parasites\\", and \\"The Jew wanted this war\\". Blood libel allegations were resuscitated, and antisemitic theories of individuals such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain were profiled. The newspaper also agitated for anti-Jewish measures. In December 1942, following the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations against Nazi Germany's ongoing extermination of European Jews, Arijsk√Ω boj claimed in an article title that \\"The Jewish Mischling [half-breed] Masaryk, Jr., threatens from London\\". In another article two weeks later, the paper recommended continued support for the persecution of Jews despite the threat of prosecution after the war and information from foreign radio that the Jews deported from the Protectorate were being systematically murdered. The antisemitic content and promotion of collaboration did not decrease, even after it became clear that Germany would lose the war. In 1944, several contributors to the magazine, including Nov√°k, published a book titled \\"Proti≈æidovsk√° ƒç√≠tanka\\" (Anti-Jewish Reader). In March 1945, Nov√°k claimed that antisemitism was victorious and that \\"The great significance of 15 March 1939 [German occupation of Czechoslovakia] lies... in the fact that we got rid of the Jews forever!\\" Denunciations The \\"Floodlight\\" section on the third page was dedicated to insults and denunciations against specific Jews and non-Jews, usually with addresses and threats. The newspaper solicited denunciations of Jews and non-Jews who failed to follow anti-Jewish regulations or were insufficiently pro-Nazi from its readership, making it easier for Czechs to make denunciations without going directly to Nazi institutions. \\"Write us, call (our telephone number is 313-75), visit us. Take part actively in the purifying anti-Jewish struggle.\\" In his postwar trial for collaboration, Nov√°k estimated that he had received 60 such letters daily and it was not possible to print them all. The Czech police investigated all of these denunciations and some of the victims of denunciations were arrested by the Gestapo and deported to concentration camps. Not all victims survived the experience. Its role in printing denunciations meant that Arijsk√Ω boj and similar newspapers played a key role in the isolation of the Jewish population during the first years of the German occupation. People‚Äîespecially sympathizers of National Partnership‚Äîdenounced others that they knew, claiming that they aided Jews or continued to associate with them. Denunciations also affected Czechs who were accused of sympathy to Jews, preventing those inclined from offering aid. Not all denunciations targeted individuals: one anonymous letter alleged: \\"For its Jewish politics the former state paid the highest price: collapse and destruction... never forget the period of Jewish rule.\\" Most correspondents had specific complaints, such as the fact that the synagogue at Moravsk√© Budƒõjovice, though it had been shuttered, still had Hebrew signage; or that Jews had not yet been banned \\"from going to the market in the morning\\". In one complaint against a baker selling bread to a Jew, the writer said, \\"It's high time for the Czech person to understand that the Jew is his greatest enemy.\\" Some denunciations shed light not just on the willingness of antisemites to report on their neighbors, but also the resistance to Nazi edicts among other Czechs. According to one writer from the town of ƒå√°slav: Aftermath The last issue was published 4 May 1945, the day before the Prague uprising. Nov√°k was arrested eleven days later by the Allied authorities. In 1947, he was convicted of collaboration and sentenced to death by hanging. V√°clav P√≠≈°, the regional editor in ƒå√°slav, was also convicted, sentenced to death, and executed in 1947. In his editing, P√≠≈° had focused on attacking specific Czech \\"Jew-lovers\\" rather than political writing on the Reich or the exile government. Although dozens of people were tried for denunciations to Arijsk√Ω boj and the similar newspaper Vlajka, denunciations were difficult to prove and typically initiated by Holocaust survivors. However, most Czech Jews did not survive in order to testify; in Nov√°k's trial, most evidence was given by Jews who had been in mixed marriages. In 2012, former Prime Minister Milo≈° Zeman claimed that the campaign in the Czech Republic against restitution to churches for communist confiscations resembles Arijsk√Ω boj.

McCaslin is an American football coach and former player. He is currently the defensive tackles coach at the University at Buffalo. He was previously head coach at Benedictine University, and a long-time assistant at the University of Nebraska Omaha prior to the discontinuance of football at that institution after the 2010 season. He also spent four seasons as a defensive coordinator under Chris Creighton at Drake University and Eastern Michigan University.  Playing career  McCaslin grew up in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and played football at Cheyenne East High School. McCaslin's best friend at Cheyenne East was Aaron Keen, who also played on the football team and whose father was the head coach. The two's coaching careers would overlap several times in the following decades. He attended Hastings College in Hastings, Nebraska, graduating with a degree in 1995. At Hastings, he played wide receiver for head coach Dan Kratzer.  Coaching career  = Nebraska‚ÄìOmaha = Following his graduation from Hastings in 1995, McCaslin taught at Benson High School in Omaha, Nebraska, also serving as an assistant football coach. In 1997 he became a graduate assistant at the then-NCAA Division II University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO) of the North Central Conference under head coach Pat Behrns, inaugurating a 14-year tenure at that institution. Also on the staff at that time was Lance Leipold, who would later hire McCaslin as an assistant at the University at Buffalo. McCaslin steadily ascended the coaching ranks at UNO on the defensive side of the ball, becoming defensive line coach in 2000 and defensive coordinator in 2005. He gained the title of associate head coach in 2007. McCaslin had hopes of eventually succeeding Behrns as head coach, reflecting later that \\"I felt like I was on a path...It was definitely a desire of mine to try and become the head coach down the road.\\" Keen joined the staff in 2008 as offensive coordinator. McCaslin's career at UNO came to a halt in the spring of 2011 when the school decided to transition to NCAA Division I and join the Summit League. As part of this change, UNO dropped football and wrestling. = Drake and Eastern Michigan = McCaslin briefly made a living in the Omaha area working in sales before moving back into coaching. He was a candidate for the head coaching jobs at two schools: South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&T;) in Rapid City, South Dakota, and Chadron State College in Chadron, Nebraska. At SDSM&T; he would have succeeded the retiring Dan Kratzer, his former coach at Hastings. In the end, the jobs went to Stacy Collins and Jay Long, respectively. McCaslin eventually landed at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, as defensive coordinator for the 2012 season, after reaching out to head coach Chris Creighton. McCaslin replaced Brian Ward, who had left to take a similar job with Western Illinois University. Drake completed in the Pioneer Football League (part of the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision) for football. McCaslin served as defensive coordinator for the 2012 and 2013 seasons; Drake's 2013 defense ranked fifth in the FCS in rushing. When Creighton departed Drake for the Eastern Michigan University head coaching job after the 2013 season, he brought McCaslin with him as his new defensive coordinator. Before the start of the 2014 season Eastern hired Keen, recently interim head coach at Minnesota State University, Mankato, as special teams coordinator. Eastern Michigan competed in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). McCaslin inherited a defense which had ranked in the bottom quarter of the FBS the previous year. Eastern Michigan struggled on both sides of the ball during Creighton's first two years, to the point that the faculty union and student government would question the viability of continuing the program in early 2016. The 2015 team had the worst defense in FBS.

The song tells the story of a man's indecision about choosing between his couple and his lover, not wanting any of the two to suffer. Torres said that the inspiration of the song came from the coincidence of two female friends of him. When he was in Los Angeles he had two female friends in the extremes of the city, and he thought they would never meet because of the distance, but finally that situation happened and he had to face it.

Her feminism was also reflected in her later poetry collections, including Ur moderlivet (From Mother's Life, 1978) and √Öterv√§xt (Regrowth, 1982). She established the publishing house Hantverk in 1984 and gave writing courses throughout Swedish-speaking Finland. Biography Born on 20 February 1940 in Vaasa, Nystr√∂m studied Swedish literature and Nordic philology at the University of Helsinki, graduating in 1968. Thereafter she became an assistant for Nordic philology at the university and worked as a journalist for the Finnish broadcaster Rundradion. From 1974 to 1978, together with Boucht, she coordinated studies at the Folkets bildningsf√∂rbund (People's Education Association). Together they published the ground-breaking Denna v√§rld √§r v√•r! Handbok i systerskap (1975), presenting their views of women's new place in society. They cried out: \\"Give women the tools to let them see and analyse their oppression, reassess their history and, in so doing, achieve feminist awareness and understanding of their true identity.\\" Nystr√∂m feminist stance is reflected in her poetry collections Ur moderlivet (1978) and √Öterv√§xt (1982). She went on to support various Swedish-Finnish feminist, peace and political movements, including the Vietnam Movement, the Social Democratic association Br√∂d och Rosor (Bread and Roses), and the Women Marxist-Feminists group which she co-founded.

It is the converted General Office of Boord & Son's Distillery, which was built between 1899 and 1901 and designed by Aston Webb, an English architect who designed the principal facade of Buckingham Palace and the main building of the Victoria and Albert Museum.  History  Aston Webb House was built in 1899‚Äì1901 on land purchased from Magdalen College, Oxford,'A Visit to A Famous Distillery', 18 and is the sole remnant of a huge industrial complex belonging to Boord & Son, a long-established firm of distillers that was established in 1726.Kelly's Post Office Directory (1908), 160. From 1925, it appears the property was gradually occupied by other companies. In 2003 the building was redeveloped to provide \\"fourteen luxury apartments with a feature staircase set within an existing glazed galleried atrium\\".  Location  The building is set back from the River Thames across from the City of London (London financial district), between London Bridge and Tower Bridge. It is on the doorstep of the More London development and London Bridge station and is a short walk from landmarks including Borough Market, Hays Galleria, The Shard, The Tower of London, and HMS Belfast.  Style  The building was described by one Edwardian architectural commentator as follows: > In Tooley Street is the distillery of Messrs. Boord & Son, a building faced > with picked yellow stocks and stone and red-brick dressings. The offices lie > compact between circular turrets bound together by a string-course, becoming > a cornice in the interval. These turrets, the entrance doorway, and the > quality of the brickwork invest the structure with distinction even among > bulky neighbours. An English Heritage architectural report completed in 1999 notes: > The building is illustrative of Webb's early, pre-1900 career, which was > characterised by eclecticism and variety of styles, including 'free Arts & > Crafts', 'Jacobean', 'free Tudor', 'Franco-Flemish' and 'Fran√ßois Premier'. > This period, which is generally regarded by critics as covering his more > original work, saw not only the completion of famous public buildings, but > of significant commercial and industrial buildings in London. Executed in > high quality yellow stocks with red-brick dressings and liberal use of stone > for the entrance frontispiece, cornice and details, it is conceived in a > Free Classical style. Distinction resides in the commanding rounded corner > tourelles rising from ground to pointed conical slate roofs ‚Äì a reference to > Norman Shaws' New Scotland Yard.

Partridge (September 10, 1823 ‚Äì July 17, 1900) was an American pioneer and engineer in Union County, Ohio, known locally as \\"The Bridge Builder\\". Early Life Reuben Partridge was born September 10, 1823 in Wilmington, New York to Cyrus and Lucinda Partridge, he was one of four children. Prior to 1836, his family moved from New York to Franklin County, Ohio.The Bridge Builder of Union County, ChuckeryOhio.com, 2008. When Reuben was 13 years old, his father died. His mother moved them to Marysville in Union County, where her son from a previous marriage, Rowland Lee, was an accomplished wagon maker. Reuben attended school for a short time, then spent over 8 years building carriages with his family. After that, he became interested in bridge building. On October 20, 1846, he married Marysville native Maria Wolford (1825-1901), and they had 6 children.Gathered from US census data 1860-1900, Reuben L. Partridge, PartridgeNest.com. Bridge Builder Due to the design of local bridges at the time, they would sometimes crumple under the sudden stress of heavy rains. Partridge saw this and worked to design a new truss and brace system to support additional stresses including vehicle traffic. In 1855, he built the first self-supporting bridge in Union County.Kennedy, Willella Shearer. \\"Heritage: Being Little Stories of Union County\\". Union County Historical Society, Printed by The Marysville Journal Tribune. 1963. Pg. 48. On June 11, 1872, he received a patent for a new U-shaped truss bridge design, the \\"Partridge Truss\\" (Patent #127,791).United States Patent Office, Specifications and Drawings of Patents Issued from the U.S. Patent Office, 1872, Patent #127,791. As of 1882, Partridge was responsible for having built 90% of the bridges in Union County, and by 1883 had built over 125 in total. In 1886, he moved to Columbus, and worked as the Vice President of the Columbus Bridge Company for the next 10 years. While most of the bridges he built were wooden covered bridges of the \\"Partridge truss\\" design, he did design and build some iron bridges while with Columbus Bridge Company. Partridge moved back to Marysville in 1896, to a house he designed and built for his wife on West 7th Street. He died 4 years later, on July 17, 1900, from complications after breaking his leg falling through a bridge he was supervising the removal of in Taylor Township north of Marysville.Irick, Ronald, Reuben L. Partridge Historical Marker, HistoricalMarkerDatabase.com, October 4, 2017. Over the course of his life, Partridge built over 200 bridges across Union County and central Ohio. He was also an active member of the first militia formed in Union County, a Marysville city council member, township clerk, township trustee, and avid supporter of the local veterans of the Mexican War and Civil War. He is buried at the Oakdale Cemetery in Marysville. Historic Bridges Partridge built four of the six historic wooden covered bridges still standing in Union County today, the Bigelow Bridge (1873), Cullbertson Bridge (1872), Pottersburg Bridge (1872), and Spain Creek Bridge (1883). The Reed Bridge (1884) was originally on this list also, but collapsed in August 1993. The only other bridge of Partridge's that is still standing outside of Union County is the Bergstresser Covered Bridge (1887) near Canal Winchester, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Public Mural In 2010, the city of Marysville commissioned a large public mural located at in Uptown Marysville in honor of Partridge. It was painted by Columbus artist Curtis Goldstein, and paid for in part by a grant from Dayton Power & Light.

Her research considers the development of chickens that cannot spread avian influenza (bird flu). She has previously served on the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.  Early life and education  Sang studied natural sciences at the University of Cambridge and graduated in 1972. She earned her doctorate in the Department of Botany where she studied genetic recombination in Sordaria. She worked in the laboratory of Harold Leslie Keer Whitehouse. After earning her PhD, Sang was awarded a SERC‚ÄìNATO fellowship to look at mismatch repair in E. coli working with Matthew Meselson at Harvard University.  Research and career  Sang returned to the United Kingdom as a Medical Research Council fellow working with David Finnegan at the University of Edinburgh. Here she investigated the transposable element that is responsible for the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Sang was made principal investigator at the Agriculture and Food Research Council (AFRC) Poultry Research Centre, which became the Roslin Institute in 1993. Sang has dedicated much of her research career to the genetic modification of chickens. In the 1980s when Sang started at the Roslin Institute she started to investigate ways to genetically modify hens so that they created valuable proteins in their eggs. She proposed purifying the egg whites and making use of the engineered proteins for medical therapies to treat cancer, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Since then, genome editing has evolved so that genes can be inserted into the DNA of chickens, producing new human proteins alongside those in egg white. Working with Lissa Herron Sang demonstrated new ways to purify these egg proteins. In 2019 she demonstrated that these hens could produce IFNalpha2a, a protein which has anti-viral and anti-cancer potential. She has developed new ways to produce transgenic chickens using lentiviral vectors. The transgenic chickens can serve as models for investigations into vertebrate development. Sang and colleagues developed transgenic lines that incorporated green fluorescent protein and membrane localised green fluorescent proteins in cells that are developing embryos. These could be used for in vivo imaging or grafting to analyse lineage during embryogenesis. In 2011 together with Laurence Tiley Sang demonstrated that she could genetically modify chickens to confer resistance to avian influenza. = Awards and honours = Sang is a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2008) and the Royal Society of Biology.

History  = Pre- war service = Designed and built in the Port Glasgow yards of Lithgow's Ltd, the vessel entered service under the name Doricstar before her name was changed to Doric Star in 1929. She was owned by Eastman's of London and managed by the Blue Star Line. In 1934 Doric Star underwent significant alterations which were carried out by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Jarrow-on-Tyne. The refit saw her receive a new Maierform bow which increased her overall length to . Her registered ownership changed in 1939 when she was acquired by the Union Cold Storage Company of Liverpool, but continued to be managed by the Blue Star Line. = Second World War =  Background  Following the outbreak of war between Germany and the Allies in September 1939, Adolf Hitler ordered the German Navy to begin commerce raiding against Allied merchant traffic. Under the command of Captain Hans Langsdorff, Admiral Graf Spee sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 21 August 1939, bound for the South Atlantic. She rendezvoused with her supply ship Altmark on September 1 at a position southwest of the Canary Islands following which she received her orders to commence commerce raiding on September 26. The Admiral Graf Spee was under strict instructions to adhere prize rules. This required her to stop and search all intercepted vessels for contraband before sinking them, and to also ensure that the crews of such vessels were safely evacuated prior to any action taking place.Initially the sortie was successful, with Graf Spee intercepting and sinking ships across the South Atlantic before making her way into the southern Indian Ocean. = Interception = Employed on the Blue Star Line's New Zealand - Australia - United Kingdom route (via Cape Town), the Doric Star departed Auckland in November 1939 under the command of Captain William Stubbs with a crew of 64. Carrying 8,000 tons of cargo (primarily meat and dairy produce), Doric Star was armed with a 4-inch gun mounted aft in order to provide some limited self defence. Panzerschiff Admiral Graf Spee On 2 December, having departed Table Bay, Doric Star was sighted by the Graf Spee's Arado Ar 196 floatplane. At this time the standard operating procedure of Captain Langsdorff was to approach his quarry head on, at maximum speed, whilst flying the French Ensign. On this particular occasion Langsdorff was aided by the additional disguise of an extra funnel and main turret which had been added during Graf Spee's previous rendezvous with the Altmark. The crew of the Doric Star were subsequently made aware of the proximity of the Graf Spee when a small piece of shell landed on her forward deck - the shell had exploded about 100 yards off her port quarter, the shot having being fired from a range of 15 miles. Captain Stubbs, having arrived on the bridge, sighted what he thought was the masthead of a warship in the distance and ordered the signal R-R-R (I am being attacked by a raider) to be sent by the ship's wireless operator, William Comber. As the Graf Spee closed to within 8 miles another shell landed approximately 200 yards off the Doric Star's starboard bow. This resulted in Doric Star amplifying her distress call - identifying the raider as the Graf Spee, or possibly the Deutschland, which had been roughly disguised to look like the Repulse or Renown. Graf Spee subsequently sent a signal by morse lamp to Doric Star informing her to discontinue transmitting, however this was ignored and Comber continued to transmit his signals which were subsequently received and repeated by other ships in the area - notably the Doric Star's sister, Brisbane Star (also en- passage from New Zealand to the United Kingdom), and the Port Chalmers. The transmission was also acknowledged by an unidentified shore station at 14:17 hrs, however it was not until 00:07 hrs the following morning that shore stations started to transmit the sighting report as given by Port Chalmers. SS Port Chalmers As the Graf Spee closed to within 1 mile Capt. Stubbs realised his situation was hopeless and decided to stop his ship, following which a boarding party was despatched from the Graf Spee who evacuated Doric Star's crew and in the process retrieved 19 silver bars. However, due to a technical fault with the Arado Ar 196 Langsdorff was forced to curtail the actions of the boarding party which subsequently meant they failed to discover the cargo of refrigerated meat.  Sinking  With the crew of the Doric Star transferred to the Graf Spee the boarding party proceeded to sink the Doric Star, however this proved to be more difficult than initially envisaged. Scuttling charges were placed within the ship however they failed to have the desired effect. Following this Graf Spee opened fire using some of her secondary armament of SK C/28 guns discharging 7 rounds which, with the aid of a torpedo, finally sank the Doric Star.  Aftermath  Having sunk the Doric Star Langsdorff transferred the majority of the crew to the Altmark when the Graf Spee rendezvoused with her on the evening of 6 December. Graf Spee subsequently retained Doric Star's five officers, including Captain Stubbs, who were onboard Graf Spee along with other allied prisoners when she took part in the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December. Following the battle, the damaged Graf Spee made passage to Montevideo and upon arrival all prisoners on board were released. = Altmark = Altmark attempted to return to Germany, steaming around the north of Great Britain and then within the Norwegian littoral. On 14 February 1940 Altmark, proceeding south within Norwegian territorial waters, was discovered by three British Lockheed Hudsons from RAF Thornaby and pursued by several British destroyers led by . Late on 16 February 1940 in J√∏ssingfjord she was fired upon. During the skirmish Altmark was run onto the rocks. Following the action the 58 members of the Doric Star's ships' company, together with all other prisoners held on board the Altmark, were subsequently freed. The prisoners were quick to condemn their treatment on the Altmark and particularly the conduct of the ship's Master, Captain Heinrich Dau. Brisbane Star = Brisbane Star = Whilst she was under attack, the Doric Star's wireless transmissions, and those of her sister Brisbane Star, were useful to the British authorities in their endeavours to track the Graf Spee and ultimately prompted Commodore Henry Harwood to take his three cruisers to the mouth of the River Plate, which he suspected might be Langsdorff's next target. Having dealt with the Doric Star, and knowing the Brisbane Star was nearby, the Graf Spee set a course to intercept. However she encountered the Tairoa on 3 December, and the subsequent time spent sinking the Tairoa allowed the Brisbane Star to escape. Two of Doric Star's crew - Captain William Stubbs and Second Engineer George King - subsequently received the King's Commendation for Brave Conduct. Official number Official numbers are issued by individual flag states. They should not be confused with IMO ship identification numbers. Doric Star had the UK Official Number 146193.

History In the year of 1905, a healing spring in the village of Leppersdorf in the municipality of Scharten was discovered. In 1926, Otto Burger had the idea to enhance the springwater by adding fruit syrup and selling it under the name \\"Schartner Bombe\\" (eng.:\\"a bomb from Scharten\\"). Its name is derived from the bomb-like shape of the initial design of the bottle.
