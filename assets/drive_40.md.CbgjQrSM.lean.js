It is one of the oldest Roman Catholic churches in the country, and the oldest and the biggest colonial church in Nueva Ecija. The church has been a pilgrimage site for two patron saints of Gapan and also of Nueva Ecija; the Three Kings, and the Divina Pastora (Divine Shepherdess). On April 26, 1986, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines declared the church as a National Shrine.  Foundation  The Augustinians formally accepted Gapan and established in it a community with its own minister on August 28, 1595. Situated across the Rio Chico, Gapan was originally bounded by Manicling, San Miguel de Mayumo and the Cordillera mountains. Due to its rapid progress, the Provincial Council decreed on October 31, 1636 that Gapan be divided into two vicariates. The first will be composed of Gapan, Junas and San Miguel and the second will be composed of the areas north of the river. In 1704, Governor General Domingo de Zabalburu ordered that all Chinese living in the missions of Bongabon, Santor, Carranglan and Pantabangan transfer to Gapan. These movement witnessed the steady increase of population. In 1612 Gapan merely had a population of 1,800 which soared to 3,651 in 1760 and in 1896, 15,238.  Construction  The Order of Saint Augustine administered the parish of Gapan from its foundation in 1595. However the secular priests took over in 1770. The present church was constructed under the direction of the friars Laredo, Cornejo and Laneza from 1856 to 1872. Fray Francisco Laredo started the construction of the church and finished the work on the walls, the dome, the presbytery and the transept. It was his successors Fray Antonio Cornejo and Fray Leonardo Laneza who worked for the completion of the church. The church was built on the spot cleared by Augustinian friars Contreras, Tendilla, Caballo and Salazar in 1595. The church is distinctly Byzantine in style and is built from blocks of limestone and bricks. The bricks, locally known as laryo, were made in two sites. The first site is only a few blocks away from the church in San Vicente while the second site is in San Lorenzo, the two oldest settlements in Gapan. The exterior of the church is plain while its interior formerly has a central retablo with niches dedicated to the Epiphany of the Lord and to the La Virgen Divina Pastora. This central retablo however was torn down in the 1970s due to infestation of termites. It was replaced with a modern style sanctuary dominated by a huge image of the Crucifixion, arguably the largest in the province of Nueva Ecija. Only the two side retablo are maintained to this day. Prominently displayed on the left retablo is the original miniature image of the Virgen Divina Pastora which was donated by the Valmonte Family in 1986. The right retablo enshrines the Adoration of the Magi. While the palitada of the walls was stripped, the grand painting of the Holy Trinity on the church's dome has been preserved. Local artist, Isidoro Samonte painted this image in the early 1900s.  Image of La Virgen Divina Pastora  The image of the La Virgen Divina Pastora is the object of the largest Marian pilgrimages in Central Luzon. Although the precise origins of the image are shrouded in legend, its recorded history is traced largely to the Valmonte Family. In the 1700s, Do√±a Juana Valmonte, daughter of Don Bartolome de la Cruz Valmonte ‚Äì Gapan‚Äôs first gobernadorcillo in 1747 ‚Äì and Do√±a Eulalia Fern√°ndez, had a strange dream in which the Virgin Mary wanted to be fetched from Spain. Distraught, she sought the advice of her father who told her to consult a friar friend in Manila. Do√±a Juana then traveled to Manila to recount her dream to the friar. Impressed by her story, the friar told of the devotion to the Divina Pastora which was gaining popularity in Spain. Do√±a Juana, on her part, ordered an image from Spain and to enthrone it in their family estate. The image eventually arrived in Manila via the Acapulco Galleon, and was brought to Gapan. It then became the center of devotion for the family. Consequently, they started to celebrate her feast in thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest every May 1. Soon stories of miracles spread throughout the province and people came in throngs to celebrate the yearly fiesta. In the 1800s, the La Virgen Divina Pastora was made patron of the parish of Gapan secondary to the Three Kings. Care of the image after the death of Dona Juana was given to her brother Don Basilio Valmonte who passed it to his son, General Panteleon Valmonte, the hero of the First Cry of Nueva Ecija. General Panteleon however was executed due to accusations of rebellion against Spain. Upon his death, the image was given to his wife Maxima Navarro- Valmonte for safekeeping. It was finally handed to Donata Valmonte-Cala and her daughter Emma Valmote-Cala. On December 19, 1963, Pope Paul VI approved the canonical coronation of the image of La Virgen Divina Pastora. Since the original image is privately owned, a church-owned image was used for the coronation rites which was presided by the first Bishop of the Diocese of Cabanatuan, Most Rev. Mariano Gaviola. The original image of the La Virgen Divina Pastora was eventually donated to the Parish of the Three Kings with the declaration of the church as a national shrine on April 26, 1986.

It is dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus under her title Our Lady of La Naval de Manila. This is the sixth church complex that has served as the motherhouse or headquarters of the Dominican Order of the Philippines. The Dominicans were one of the \\"pioneering missionaries\\" of the Philippines. The motherhouse was transferred to the Quezon City location after the Manila location was destroyed during World War II in the Philippines. Previous church buildings Prior to its current location, the Dominican Order in the Philippines were headquartered in the city of Manila. They had five church buildings, each destroyed by fire, earthquakes, and lastly a Japanese bomb during World War II. =Early church (1587)= The first Catholic missionaries to arrive in Manila were Spanish Augustinians who came in 1571 with Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi. The Franciscans came a few years later, in 1578. It was in 1587 that the first Dominicans arrived in Manila from C√°diz in Spain. They were welcomed by Domingo Salazar OP, the first Bishop of Manila. The order temporarily stayed at the Franciscan convent in Manila while some of them were sent north to Pangasinan and west to Bataan to begin missionary work. Salazar sponsored 3,000 pesos for the construction of the church and 300 pesos for the purchase of land. A small church was erected on August 6, 1587, made from light materials.Cultural Center of the Philippines (1994). CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Volume III. Manila: Cultural Center of the Philippines. On January 1, 1588, the chapel was inaugurated and it enshrined an image of Our Lady of the Rosary from Mexico.Ba√±as, R. C. (1937). Brief historical sketches of Philippine Catholic churches. Manila, Philippines: Commonwealth Press. =Second church (1592)= In 1589, the church was partially destroyed by an earthquake. As the roof had collapsed, the Dominicans decided to build a larger church made of stronger material. Through the direction of Father Alonzo Jim√©nez, the second church was made from stone. Contributions were given by Mar√≠a P√©rez, Captain Domingo Mendiola, and a certain Captain Castillo. The church was inaugurated on April 9, 1592. =Third church (early 17th century)= A fire on April 30, 1603 destroyed a third of a city, including the church and its convent. Almost immediately after the blaze, a bigger and costlier third church was built. It contained a stone vault as precaution against fire and earthquake; and donations were used to fund construction. Though made of stone, it was destroyed by another earthquake on November 30, 1645, leaving only the high altar standing. =Fourth church (1862)= A fourth church of stone and hardwood was built. It had wooden arches and wooden posts supporting the roof, thus dividing it into three naves. The artistic interior designs were executed under the direction of Father Francisco Gainza. The church took two years to build, and its structural soundness made it last for 250 years. Initiated by Father Castro, a new fa√ßade was planned. Flanked by two towers, it was patterned after London‚Äôs St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, designed by Christopher Wren. Work on the fa√ßade alone lasted almost a year. The church was inaugurated on June 15, 1862 with great festivity. On June 3, 1863, the Philippines experienced one of the strongest earthquakes in its history, the church ruined by quake of the same intensity as that which hit Manila in 1645. =Fifth church (1887)= A few months after the 1863 earthquake, F√©lix R√≥xas presented a plan for the church‚Äôs reconstruction, partly following the plan of the previous church and utilizing some of its salvageable parts. On August 30, 1864, the cornerstone of the present church was laid. In it was placed a lead box, containing art objects, gold coins, medals of saints and other things belonging to the ‚ÄúOrden de Predicadores‚Äù. Construction occurred from 1864 to 1887 in the gotico fingido (neogothic) style, using Philippine building materials. The immense columns resembling spreading tree branches, were of acle, molave and ipil. The vault was of zinc or galvanized iron. The stained glass windows were ordered from Europe. The four retablos were made under the direction of Father Joaqu√≠n Sabater, a professor of drawing at the University of Santo Tom√°s. Alberoni directed the painting of the main altar. The church measured at the central aisles, and high at the lateral aisles. Its towers rose to . Although Fr. Sixto and Fr. Ristoro would supervise construction of the church, the Dominicans contracted the services of the European-trained architect F√©lix Roxas Sr. Roxas, adapting the seismic realities, designed a church with story of stone an upper story of wood. He worked closely with Isabelo Tampinco who decorated the interior with carving imitating the fan vault reminiscent of the English gothic; the walls and ceiling of the sacristy were similarly treated. Even the furniture in the sacristy was treated in the gothic manner. The chapel of the Nuestra Se√±ora de Rosario had an altar with lancet arches and gothic-inspired ornamented pinnacles. Its floor was made of native molave and narra and the pulpit was of fine carving, with the images representing the different saints of the Order. A dove was attached to the sounding board of the pulpit, above which, there was an angel. The choir-loft was spacious and was protected by wrought from railing manufactured in the Philippines. Over the central doorway, on the roof was enclosed in a glass case original Virgin of the Rosary, which had been there for many centuries. The central altar had three saints. In the center was Saint Dominic, at the left was Saint Francis and at the right was Saint Theresa of Jesus. Above Saint Dominic was the statue of Saint Mary Magdalene. The cupola above had many colored glass windows. Inside, was a balcony surrounded by iron railing. Our Lady of the Rosary had a separate chapel at the right of the high altar. This image was donated by the Governor-General Luis Perez Dasmarinas and carved by a Chinese, under competent direction. Many persons claim to have secured much help from this marvellous image especially from women, who placed the skirt of the image over their abdomen during their difficult delivery. It was recorded that this image saved the island during the Dutch invasions of 1646 and that on October 5, 1907, it was canonically crowned. Its ivory hands and face, costly garments and crown were very artistic. Saint Dominic was at the left of the image, kneeling and receiving a rosary, while at the right was Saint Catalina de Siena. In the same chapel, there were two more lofty altars. The one at the right, was dedicated to Saint Vincent Ferrer, and the other on the left, to the Holy Family. In this chapel, the interesting historical canvas, painted in Rome in 1909, represented the priest, Saint Dominic, baptizing a Chinese while the two other natives stand watching him. Near this chapel was the sacristy in which were the chests of camagon with their fine carvings. These chests contained the costly vestments of the priests. A big crucifix was at one end of the hall near a stairway leading to the monastery. Below this image there was a half-length portrait of the Virgin Dolores. On the walls of sacristy, there were canvases of interest and value from a religious standpoint. There were four more altars in the main church. The two on the left were dedicated to the Immaculate Conception and in Saint Thomas respectively: the two on the right, to Our Savior and to Saint Joseph. Below the Crucifix was the ‚ÄúSanto Sepulcro‚Äù which could be seen thru the glass cover. From the lofty ceiling of the church, there were costly and heavy chandeliers, and on the lateral walls, there were images carved in wood, showing the different stages of the life of Christ. The church incurred damage over time and was repaired. In 1887, the vault and the rose windows of batikuling were restored. The main altar was almost totally renovated, and the columns repaired. The roof of the bell towers was renovated to assume a crown-like form. In 1941, the Gothic church of Santo Domingo in Intramuros was destroyed at the advent of the Second World War. On December 21, 1941 the church and the Dominican monastery beside it were hit by Japanese bombs. This was the first church to be ruined during the Pacific War. The friars, archives, the image of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of La Naval and other movable property like ivory statues, gala vestments of the Virgin; jewelry, and sacred vessels were the only survivors of the war. The image was transferred to Sant√≠simo Rosario Church at the University of Santo Tom√°s (UST) in Espa√±a, Manila.Jose, R. T., & Ayala Museum (1991).

The site is now a financial hub with occupants including Bank of the Philippine Islands, with a historical marker reminding visitors of what used to stand on the site. Current building (1954) Santo Domingo Church facade After the Second World War, the Dominicans constructed the sixth church in a new location. They built it on a portion of land they had purchased in Quezon City. The Dominicans commissioned Jos√© Ma. Zaragoza to design the building while he was still a student of architecture at UST. =Architecture= The new Santo Domingo church was built in the Art Deco combined with Spanish Modern style, which was unlike the Baroque churches built during Spanish period. The church employed the latest technique in reinforced-concrete building.Diocese of Cubao. (n.D.) The Mission-style architecture includes Romanesque and Gothic designs that accommodate more space. Measuring with a height of , there is a total floor area of . It is the biggest church in Metro Manila and one of the biggest churches in Asia. The Santo Domingo church complex was inaugurated on October 12, 1954. They icon of Our Lady of La Naval was brought to the new church in 1957 in a spectacular procession. The church fa√ßade has receding planes with leaves designed in corbel arches. Over the triple portals of the church is a high-relief frieze depicting the story of the La Naval. The giant bas-relief of Santo Domingo was designed by the Italian sculptor and expatriate Francesco Monti. In the nave of the church there are eight colorful murals by National Artist Carlos Francisco depicting the life and times of Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n, the Spaniard who founded the Order of Preachers. Francisco‚Äôs murals are just below the equally brilliant murals of the Four Evangelists in vivid brown tones by Vicente Garc√≠a Llamas. One of Galo Ocampo's stained class windows Curved windows of the church frame masterful stained-glass designs by Galo Ocampo whose bases show different ecclesiastical seals. The windows depict the original 15 Stations of the Holy Rosary as well as the Battle of Lepanto and La Naval de Manila; and the martyrdoms of San Vicente Liem de la Paz and San Francisco Capillas, Dominican protomartyrs of Vietnam and China, respectively. Right behind Sto. Domingo Church‚Äôs facade is an intricately carved panels and stained glass windows lie a treasure trove of the Philippines‚Äô rich cultural heritage and the object of centuries-old devotion, the image of Our Lady of the Rosary of La Naval, the oldest Marian icon in the country. =Treasures= High-relief frieze at the facade depicting the story of the La Naval. Aside from being an architectural jewel, the Santo Domingo Church houses artistic treasures. The second to sixth Santo Domingos were bound by a common symbol, the image of the Nuestra Se√±ora del Sant√≠smo Rosario or La Naval de Manila. The image of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of La Naval is kept on the left side altar all year round, except during the October fiesta when a special canopy and platforms are built for it behind the main altar. The La Naval image has been the object of Filipino devotion that dates back to the 16th century, and the icon‚Äôs shrine in Quezon City is host to an annual feast that culminates in a procession that draws tens of thousands of devotees. Opposite in the left, a side altar dedicated to Saint Mart√≠n de Porres. Devotees of Our Lady of La Naval would offer her jewelry. In the church‚Äôs jewellery collection, the La Naval image has a brooch described as ‚Äústudded with small diamonds, seed pearls and colored gems.‚Äù It is believed to have been offered to the Virgin by a certain Josefa Roxas Manio, a native of Calumpit, Bulacan, in the 19th century, after having received it as a courtship gift from Norodom I of Cambodia. Somewhere in the vast church complex is a secret vault holding centuries-old ivory icons and wooden images of saints made by Filipino craftsmen; exquisite, gem-studded, age-old crowns; golden Marian robes; and fine jewelry for the Virgin presented by fervent devotees. The secrecy about the vault makes sense: In October 1762, thieves broke into the Sto. Domingo Church in Intramuros and took some of its rare treasures, prompting security of the church's treasures since then. Other treasures that are deemed fit for public viewing can be found in the church's museum, to the left of the church. Another notable gift is the National Artist medallion, which ardent devotee Nick Joaquin instructed his heirs to donate to the La Naval Virgin before he died in 2004. The medallion has been affixed to the statue‚Äôs foot since then. Stored in the vault, according to the book, are prewar ivory heads and hands for statues of several saints, including St. Dominic, St. Vincent Ferrer, St. Catherine de Ricci, St. Agnes of Montepulciano and St. Antoninus of Florence. =Pipe organ= The giant choir loft where the century-old pipe organ is located In the giant choir loft is almost a century-old pipe organ made by Fray Gregorio Hontomin, OP made in Rosaryhill in Hong Kong. The Dominicans transferred the pipe organ from Hong Kong to the Sto. Domingo Church in 1954 after the Chapel of St. Albert the Great‚Äôs Priory, the center of religious formation and studies of the Dominican Province of the Holy Rosary, closed. The inauguration of the pipe organ was June 9, 1959. It was restored to its grandeur by Diego Cera Organbuilders Inc., custodians of the world-famous Las Pi√±as bamboo organ. The restoration involved repositioning of the pipe organs from the edges to slightly forward, reconstruction and modernization of the organ console from scratch, and most likely a reworked wind pump system. = Museo de Santo Domingo = The Santo Domingo Museum (also Museo de Santo Domingo) houses other valuable objects‚Äîsuch as centuries-old crucifixes made of gold and silver, rosaries and a tabernacle, all of which had been used in the old Santo. Domingo Church in Intramuros. =Columbary and Mortuary= The church has two mortuary facilities located at the right side of the church where wakes can be held for the deceased. One is located below the belfry of the church, and the other, at the right side beside the altar and the entrance to their columbary. In addition, the former idle area and storage area of the church, at the rear part of the church adjacent to the altar has been developed to be a columbary, and an interment area. Called the Santuario de Santo Domingo, the facility offers columbary valuts for urns, with sections named after Dominican Saints. The central part of the Santuario is exclusively dedicated to the Order of Preachers, housing urns, bones and interred remains of Dominican clergymen. Declaration as a National Cultural Treasure The Dominicans endorsed the designation of the Santo Domingo Church and the Shrine of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of La Naval de Manila as a National Culture Treasure to the National Museum in 2011. It has been listed as a National Cultural Treasure following the signing of Museum Declaration no. 4 on October 4, 2012 during the enthronement rites for theOur Lady of the Rosary of La Naval and unveiling o the official marker on December 8, 2012. The declaration is the highest distinction the government can confer on a cultural property. The declaration follows Republic Act No. 4846, otherwise known as the Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act. It is the first national cultural treasure listed in Quezon City.

It is located approximately north of Clackline, in Western Australia's Wheatbelt region. The reserve is extends east to Clackline‚ÄìToodyay Road, south to before Great Eastern Highway, and west to an unnamed road that runs north-west from Refractory Road. In March 2005, the reserve was in size, with an additional added in 2008/09. It is listed on the non-statutory Register of the National Estate. Description Clackline Nature Reserve has two distinct landforms. To the west is a gently undulating terrain and in the east the land is dissected into steep sided valleys and ridges. Vegetation is chiefly woodland with variation in trees with soil type. They include jarrah, marri wandoo, powderbark wandoo, brown mallet, rock sheoak, Christmas tree and bull banksia. A rare species of orchid not known in any other reserve occurs, caladenia triangularis. =Vegetation= There are a range of soil types across Clackline Nature Reserve, with clays, sandy clays and loamy soils in the lower sections of the topography, while pallid zone clays are exposed on erosional slopes, and gravely soils occur at the top of breakaways. There is a similar diversity of vegetation, with wandoo at the low points, powderbark on the slopes, and jarrah or marri woodland on the breakaway tops. There are five general patterns of vegetation based around these species: The reserve contains the rare plant species acacia aphylla (Leafless Rock Wattle) and the priority two flora species stenanthemum grandiflorum. =Fauna= Clackline Nature Reserve is home to a variety of different species. Typical mammals in the reserve are the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus), western brush wallaby (M. irma), euro (M. robustus), echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and rabbit. A variety of reptiles are present, including at least five frog, four gecko, three legless lizard, one dragon, two goarina, five skink, and five snake species; and there are more than fifty species of bird, notably the Wedge-tailed Eagle and Dusky Woodswallows. History =Background= Though part of a north-south ridge system, the Clackline area has been easily accessed for many years due to the gap through which Clackline Brook, Great Eastern Highway, and the former Eastern Railway passed. While the southern area was released for agriculture and settlement, the area to the north was too rugged, postponing its release. In 1928, an application was made to purchase land in the area. However, as the block was \\"carrying good stands of Wandoo\\" according to the Conservator of Forests, on 6 January 1929 a timber reserve was created, with an area of . Over the next 44 years, however, the area decreased to . =Establishment= A nearby resident, botanist Ray Paynter, coordinated an effort to protect the Clackline area for conservation purposes in the 1960s and 70s. The Department of Mines opposed the idea, even though the operators of Clackline Refractory, which mined in the area, were supportive. Paynter and the Clackline community continued to push for the creation of a reserve. On 3 March 1973, she wrote to Northam MLA Ken McIver, citing the species of birds, orchids, and kangaroos that would benefit. Nine months later, on 21 December 1973, a reserve \\"was set aside for the Conservation of Flora and Fauna\\". =Expansion= Recommendations from the Department of Environment and Conservation in 1983 proposed increasing the area of Clackline Nature Reserve by . One of the conditions for environmental approval for clearing for construction of Fiona Stanley Hospital was that \\" ... of breeding and limited foraging habitat for Carnaby's Black-Cockatoo has been secured for purchase as is to be included in the Clackline Nature Reserve\\".

In 1998 it merged with New York Hospital to form NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital. History It was founded by James Lenox in 1868, and began operations in 1872. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, World War I and World War II, the hospital operated military wards or overseas hospital bases. In 1910, the hospital became affiliated with Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, and with numerous other hospitals and institutes in Manhattan, including, in 1925, the Sloane Hospital for Women, a leader in obstetrics and gynecology that had been founded in 1886. Other institutions with which the Presbyterian Hospital became affiliated with or incorporated into its organization, were the Vanderbilt Clinic, Babies Hospital, the Neurological Institute, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Around 1920 Edward Harkness joined the Board and donated the land to complete his vision of a combining a medical school and hospital.

The first time would have been in 1636 when he travelled probably in the company of Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen who had been appointed the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil. He arrived in Brazil in 1637 but only stayed until the next year. He possible returned to Brazil in 1640. During his stay in Brazil he produced four paintings of views of Brazil and numerous drawings that were subsequently used by himself and his brother Bonaventura in paintings of Brazilian scenes.Carla Mary S. Oliveira, Frans Jansz Post y Las im√°genes del Brasil holand√©s: ¬øla mirada que registra o el pincel que interpreta? , p. 3 He was the father of Willem, Gillis the Younger and Bonaventura the Younger.Gillis Peeters at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Bonaventura the Younger was a sailor and marine artist. There are also landscapes known by Gillis the Younger. He died in Antwerp. Work Although Gillis Peeters, like most of the members of his artist family, is best known as a marine artist, landscapes account for the major portion of his output. Wooded landscape with elegant travellers and huntsman on a path One of the earliest recorded work is the Landscape with Watermill (Rijksmuseum) dated 1633. In its blue-green hues it resembles the work of his contemporary Flemish landscape artists such as Lucas van Uden.George Gordon. \\"Neyts, Gillis.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 13 Dec. 2014 His earlier landscapes representing mountains with spruce of the 1630s are characterised by their tonal palette and small figures. These early works seem to be closer to the travel landscapes of the Flemish painter Paul Bril, which depict imaginary experiences in a southern landscape, than to the Baroque of Peter Paul Rubens with its clear colours and bright light.Hans-Joachim Raupp, 'Sichtbare und Unsichtbare Welten - nach der Natur und die Phantasie', in: Maria-Theresia Leuker, Die sichtbare Welt: Visualit√§t in der niederl√§ndischen Literatur und Kunst des 17. Jahrhunderts, Waxmann Verlag, 2012, p. 105-108 Hans-Joachim Raupp, Historien und Allegorien, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 1995 In the 1640s his horizons become deeper and his colours richer. A Wooded rocky landscape with a couple tending sheep (Christie's, 14 November 2007 in Amsterdam, lot 191) of 1652 (but possibly 1632) is a typical example of his small-scale working style. Unlike contemporary Dutch landscapes, which strived for realism, the landscapes of Peeters are artificial and contrived and are intended as a form of poetry rather than a realistic document. With their candy-like colours, picturesque buildings and feathery trees they seem to anticipate the Rococo idyllic visions of a Fran√ßois Boucher hundred years later. Some of his landscapes such as those he made in Brazil (for example View of Pernambuco de Recife) are more topographical in nature. River landscape with a ferryboat His marine paintings cover the range of stormy seas, battle scenes, river scenes and harbour scenes and are similar to the early work of his brother in their muted tones and atmospheric effect. Gillis collaborated with other family members and artists in Antwerp. For instance, he collaborated with his brother Bonaventura on a painting of the Battle of Kallo and other marine scenes.About Bonaventura Peeters I at Jean Moust There is also a collaboration with David Teniers the Younger on A Scene in a Flemish Village for which Teniers painted the figures and Peeters the landscape.A Scene in a Flemish Village at Museums Sheffield Gillis was trained as an etcher and made various engravings of hunting scenes after designs by Frans Snyders and a series of rural scenes and landscapes for the Antwerp publisher Joannes Meyssens.Engravings by Gillis Peeters at the British Museum References External links Flemish Baroque painters Flemish marine artists Flemish landscape painters Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Flemish printmakers Artists from Antwerp 1612 births 1653 deaths ","title":"Gillis Peeters the Elder"},{"id":"42952017","text":"The Curdies River is a perennial river of the Corangamite catchment, located in The Otways region of the Australian state of Victoria.

During the original run it was hosted by Ruth Woods, whose segments were dropped when it was syndicated (see below). While most American anthology TV series of the 1950s aired weekly in either half-hour or hour-long time-slots, Short Short Dramas aired in a 15-minute time-slot, with two episodes broadcast each week on Tuesday and Thursday. Episodes were 12-minutes excluding ads, and a total of 78 episodes were produced. Additionally, unlike most early anthology series which were live, Short Short Dramas was an early example of a filmed dramatic series, still a relatively new idea at the time (the first filmed dramatic TV series had aired in 1949, but they were only just starting to become more common in 1952). Among its guest stars were Ernest Borgnine, Cliff Robertson, Richard Kiley, E.G. Marshall, and Leslie Nielsen. Directors included Daniel Petrie. Syndication Although it only ran for one season, it nevertheless proved popular enough to have syndicated repeats under the title Playhouse 15. A 1955 trade ad lists MCA as being the distributor. It was also exported to Australia. Starting in 1959 it aired in Sydney on ATN-7 and in Melbourne on GTV-9, as this was prior to the creation of the Nine Network and Seven Network.

Its morphology is consistent (on a cellular level) of rods that are 0.5‚Äì0.8 micrometres of both single short chains and long filament like structures. On a colony level, the bacteria appears glossy, round and white. For study, the bacteria requires malt agar and can ferment maltose, but often also requires yeast extract in order to ferment properly. To study L. hilgardii in liquid requires growing it in Elliker broth so it can show turbidity and gas formation. On staining with Gram's iodine, the bacillus is Gram positive. L. hilgardii is considered a negative catalase (enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water) and creates lactic acid, ethanol/acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. Along with this it is capable of sometimes producing biogenic amines or histamine and ethyl carbamate, which causes health risks. Its role in the fermentation of wine is that it is impactful when spoiling high-alcohol dessert wines and can be used in malolactic fermentations (winemaking fermentation). Lactobacillus hilgardii is sensitive to SO2, both not sensitive and metabolized to sorbate. It is highly tolerant to acids and pH. It is tolerant of ethanol up to 20 vol%. Lactobacillus hilgardii hybridizes easily with Lactobacillus brevis, a bacterium that it is very closely related to. Prior to its classification as a distinct species, L. hilgardii was believed to be L. brevis, and, as a result, the bacterium's ability to hybridize raised doubts about its taxonomy. L. hilgardii grows in wine when it contains 1% autolysed yeast. It also grows in ethanol at 15‚Äì18%. The bacteria grow best at 30‚Äì35 ¬∞C, but can grow at temperatures as low as 15 ¬∞C.

The radar is built by Raytheon as a follow-on to their AN/APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS). The AAS has its roots in the highly classified AN/APS-149 LSRS, which was designed to provide multi-function moving target detection and tracking and high resolution ground mapping at standoff ranges covering land, littoral, and water areas. The radar was deployed on a small number of P-3C Orions, with \\"game changing\\" results. Containing a double-sided AESA radar with near 360-degree coverage, it could scan, map, track, and classify targets, and do all of these tasks near simultaneously; it was reportedly sensitive enough to pick up a formation of people moving over open terrain. Building upon the LSRS, the AAS also has a double-sided AESA radar, which contains a moving target indicator (MTI) that can detect, classify, and track targets on land and at sea at the same time, with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) for picture-like radar imagery of both inland and ocean areas at the same time; these can profile vessels from a long distance and generate fine resolution without relying on optical sensors, especially in day or night and in adverse weather conditions. Once it detects and classifies a hostile vessel, the P-8 can send targeting information to another armed platform and guide a networked weapon (e.g. Tomahawk cruise missiles, SLAM-ER, JASSM, LRASM, SDB II) to it through a data link. The AAS is in ways superior to the AN/APY-7 used on the U.S. Air Force's E-8 Joint STARS, looking both port and starboard rather than just being side-looking. Other potential missions could include detecting and tracking low flying and stealthy cruise missiles, communications relaying, and electronic warfare as a standoff platform to penetrate contested airspace, since AESA radars are capable of radar jamming, producing fake targets, frying electronic components, and even cyberwarfare.

Here he created a private apartment, very large ballroom, a Tudor Room, coffee room, drawing room and a 350-sq yds flat roof with a garden for dining and dancing, around which neighbouring chimneys were painted brilliant red. All who visited the club shared its intimately democratic, and rickety external lift, four- person maximum, enclosed in shining metal like an art-nouveau cabin trunk, located round the corner in Meard Street. The charismatic Tennant was the self-appointed ringmaster to an arena where Bohemians could mingle comfortably with the upper crust, according to writer and film producer Michael Luke.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1487550/Michael- Luke.htmlhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/michael- luke-494831.html Of the club's opening night The Daily Telegraph observed that its 300-strong list of members \\"probably contains more famous names in society and the arts than any other purely social club\\".

To complement the main club-room's elaborate coffered ceiling painted with gold leaf, like the Alhambra, he suggested covering the walls entirely with a mosaic of imperfectly cut glass tiles from an 18th-century chateau. Matisse himself designed a stunning entrance staircase to this room in glittering steel and brass, which remained in use until the club's conversion into a studio complex in the mid-1980s. The young Tennant bought two of Matisse's paintings in Paris for ¬£600 and in the opinion of Anthony Powell they \\"lent an air of go-ahead culture to the club\\". These were the painter's daring and inventive The Red Studio from 1911 which was displayed in the bar at the Gargoyle until 1941, offered to the Tate Gallery for ¬£400 and declined, then in 1949 joined the MoMA permanent collection in New York where it still hangs.

Weidenfeld & Nicolson: London, p197. . and it remained popular among the generation of Francis Bacon, Antonia Fraser and Daniel Farson who would often go on from the Colony Room which was founded in 1948 by Muriel Belcher across at 41 Dean Street. For years the Gargoyle was one of the few places in London serving drinks at affordable prices after midnight. In 1955 the club was sold on to Michael Klinger and Jimmy Jacobs who relaunched it as a strip club called the Nell Gwynne (variously advertised as a Theatre, Club, or Revue).reviews of the top night clubs and strip joints in London 66 VOL. 6. No. 63 FEBRUARY, 1961Miles, Barry (2011). London Calling: A Countercultural History of London since 1945. Atlantic Books: London, pp480. A 1960s ad shows the club as the Nell Gwynne by day and the Gargoyle Club at night. On 19 May 1979 in the Gargoyle's rooftop club space Hammersmith-born insurance salesman Peter Rosengard\\"Latest News\\". Peter Rosengard website. Retrieved 07‚Äì04‚Äì18. started a weekly club-night on Saturdays called the Comedy Store, in partnership with comedian Don Ward. It was modelled on the original in Los Angeles, and invited audiences to show approval or disapproval of the unknown acts performing by \\"gonging\\" them off. The London Comedy Store made the reputations of many of the UK's upcoming \\"alternative comedians\\". Among the original line-up here were Alexei Sayle, Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, French & Saunders, Nigel Planer and Peter Richardson who in 1980 led these pioneers to establish the breakaway Comic Strip team elsewhere in Soho. All were to prove influential in reshaping British television comedy throughout the 1980s as stars of The Comic Strip Presents. In July 1982, among many themed weekly club-nights, came the first incarnation upstairs in the Gargoyle Club of the Batcave, a Wednesday night fronted by Olli Wisdom, lead singer in the house band, Specimen, and guitarist Jon Klein as art director. Visitors included Robert Smith, Siouxsie Sioux, Steve Severin, Foetus, Marc Almond and Nick Cave. The Nell Gwynne strip-teasers were still performing from 2.30 pm until late evening, when they could be seen exiting via the rickety lift, even as Batcavers queued to come up. By the year's end, when the upper floors were sold off, the one-nighters such as Batcave moved on. The Comedy Store moved to a series of other venues, taking over 28a Leicester Square (previously the Subway club) in 1985. It had become a template for the new style of stand-up comedy clubs that opened around the land. Don Ward dissolved his business relationship with Rosengard in late 1981 while remaining CEO of Comedy Store interests. In 1984 Rosengard went on to manage the band Curiosity Killed the Cat. The Mandrake A second private club became part of the story of 69 Dean Street during the postwar 1940s when an eccentric crowd started gathering in the Mandrake at No 4 Meard Street, a house only a few yards west of the Gargoyle's entrance with its tiny lift. An underground room was rented for a chess club by streetwise Teddy Turner and Bulgarian √©migr√© Boris Watson (after a name change), though by 1953 one basement room beneath Meard Street had become six after knocking through walls underneath No 69, to include a reading room for the intellectuals. An advert claimed the Mandrake to be \\"London's only Bohemian rendezvous\\".Miles, Barry (2011). London Calling: A Countercultural History of London since 1945. Atlantic Books: London, Chapter2. A year's membership cost half a guinea ‚Äúin advance‚Äù and the bait was illustrated with a photograph of an artist sketching beside an image of a voluptuous nude. Pretty soon the offbeat broadcaster Daniel Farson was calling its barmaid Ruth Soho's equivalent of Manet's famous Suzon painted serving at A Bar at the Folies Berg√®re. Regulars included Nina Hamnett, Brian Howard and Julian Maclaren-Ross for whom Watson would cash cheques in the form of credit behind the bar. Private membership clubs were allowed to stay opened during the strict afternoon closing hours imposed on pubs by the licensing laws, as well as late into the early hours after the 10.30 pm closing time for pubs. One condition was that clubs were required to serve food with the alcohol. Result: the Mandrake became notorious for its stale sandwiches piled behind the bar, in Watson's view available ‚Äúfor drinking with, not for eating‚Äù! Inevitably the drinkers grew to outnumber the thinkers. Soon a jukebox made its appearance along with live guitar and lute recitals, and impromptu jam sessions for jazz musicians such as pianist Joe Burns, bassists Wally Wrightman and Percy Borthwick, drummers Laurie Morgan and Robin Jones, trombonist Norman Cave, singer Cab Kaye and Ronnie Scott (later founder of Soho's pre-eminent jazz club), plus visitors such as the touring Duke Ellington band. And the 1960s brought in the legendary painters and poets who were reinforcing Soho's reputation for general non-conformity. The kitchen was forced to upgrade and, according to Michael Luke, the Mandrake became \\"a launching pad for the Gargoyle ‚Äì a place where loins could be girded and spirits stiffened for that challenging arena up above\\". By the 1970s the Mandrake had acquired a new pedimented entrance door on Meard Street, curiously now east of the Gargoyle's, just a couple of yards nearer to Dean Street. Its lease was then acquired by Soho's only Jamaican club owner, Vince Howard, who changed its name to Billy's. He spent some time trying to identify an audience, first with soul music, then becoming a blatantly gay venue in those early days following liberation. Billy's changed its name to Gossip's and became part of London's clubbing heritage by spawning scores of weekly club-nights that transformed Britain's music and fashion scene during the 1980s, crucially a Bowie night run by Steve Strange and Rusty Egan who teamed up at Billy's in 1978 and went on to open the hugely influential Blitz Club which kick-started the New Romantics movement. Reconstruction During the 1970s, the ground floor at No 69 had been occupied by A. Stewart McCracken Ltd Auction Rooms and at No 70 was the Hostaria Romana restaurant. More recently, 69‚Äì70 Dean Street became a bar in The Pitcher and Piano chain and the pair of houses became Listed Grade II. Then in the run-up to their rebirth in 2008, the interiors of numbers 69 and 70 were completely rebuilt by Soho House to create the Dean Street Townhouse hotel and restaurant. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's first date took place at the Dean Street Dining Room in the Dean Street Townhouse in 2016.

The film is presented as a series of shorts that two children and their babysitter discover on an unmarked videotape on Halloween night, all of which feature a homicidal clown named Art the Clown. The film stars Katie Maguire, Catherine Callahan, Marie Maser, and Kayla Lian, with Mike Giannelli as Art the Clown. It incorporates footage from the 2008 short film The 9th Circle, as well as the 2011 short film Terrifier, both of which were also directed by Leone and featured Art the Clown. All Hallows' Eve was released direct-to-video by Image Entertainment on October 29, 2013, and received mixed reviews. The film was followed by a standalone anthology sequel, All Hallows' Eve 2, in 2015, which features segments by different directors. The character of Art the Clown would later be featured in the 2016 film Terrifier, also written and directed by Leone. Plot After a night of trick-or-treating on Halloween, babysitter Sarah is surprised to see that children Tia and Timmy have received an unmarked VHS tape in one of their bags. The children convince Sarah to allow them to watch the tape, which contains three stories, each of which feature a homicidal clown named Art. The first segment features a young woman named Casey, who is drugged and kidnapped by Art the Clown while waiting for a train. She awakens to find herself chained in a room with two other women, Kristen and Sara. When Sara is dragged away by her chain, Casey and Kristen decide to follow where their chains lead. Upon reaching the end of the chains, Casey attempts to break the chains with a large rock, but is interrupted by a deformed humanoid who dismembers Kristen with a cleaver. The humanoid unwittingly frees Casey by severing her chains with the cleaver, but she soon finds herself tied down and surrounded by hooded figures. After watching the figures remove a fetus from the womb of a restrained pregnant woman, Casey is raped by Satan. After the segment ends, Sarah sends Tia and Timmy to bed, and decides to continue watching the VHS tape by herself. The second segment features a woman named Caroline, who has just moved into a new countryside home. At night, a bright object crashes near the house, and a power outage occurs. Caroline finds that her phone and her car are malfunctioning, and suspects that someone other than herself in the house. She suddenly receives a call from her husband John, a painter, but the connection is soon broken. She discovers that she is being stalked by an alien, and after managing to disorient it, she hides in a small room under a staircase. There, her phone rings again, alerting the alien to her location. As she is dragged off by the alien, she pulls a sheet off of one of John's paintings, revealing an image of Art the Clown. The third and final segment features a costume designer driving down an isolated road. Stopping at a gas station, she finds the attendant furiously kicking out Art, who had apparently smeared feces on the walls of the gas station's bathroom. The attendant fills her tank and hears a noise from inside the gas station while giving the costume designer directions. He goes inside to investigate, and when he doesn't return, the costume designer enters the building and sees Art chopping up the attendant's body with a hacksaw. She flees, and a chase ensues, and Art eventually appears behind her seat in her car and attempts to suffocate her with cellophane. She slams on the brakes and escapes, barricading herself inside a large shed. Art digs his way into the shed, and slashes her with a makeshift whip composed of sharp instruments. She stabs Art in the eye with a scalpel, and in the back with a knife. She escapes again and is picked up by a man who tries to drive her to a nearby police station. Art follows them in a car and shoots the man in the head with a handgun, causing their car to crash into a tree. After some time, the costume designer regains consciousness on a crude operating table, and finds that Art has amputated her limbs and breasts and carved misogynistic obscenities into her body. Disturbed, Sarah turns off the television. A home phone rings, and when Sarah answers it, she hears the costume designer from the third segment pleading for help. The television turns back on, displaying a dingy room. Art steps into the frame, approaches Sarah from within the screen, and begins to pound on the glass. Sarah then sees herself on the television screen, with Art behind her. She frantically removes the tape from the VCR and smashes it on the floor, destroying it. She then goes to check on Tia and Timmy, only to discover that Art has murdered them.

The short was filmed on 35 mm in 2006 and premiered at the Backseat Film Festival in 2008. Leone then wrote and directed Terrifier, another short film featuring Art that was released in 2011. All Hallows' Eve producer Jesse Baget viewed the Terrifier short on YouTube, prompting to him to consider including it in an anthology film with shorts by other filmmakers. According to Leone, \\"I wasn't having that, and talked him into letting me shoot everything. He was totally cool with it, and allowed me to write more and use the two shorts I had already made to create a whole, cohesive film.\\" The 9th Circle, with additional footage that was not included in the original short film, serves as the first segment of All Hallows' Eve, while the Terrifier short serves as the film's third segment. In regards to the film's second segment, Leone stated: \\"A lot of people ask me why we didn't do another Art the Clown story, and I felt if I gave people another 15 or 20 minutes of him killing someone, it would take away from the impact of 'Terrifier.'\\" He originally intended for the alien in the second segment to be created using puppetry, but due to time and budgetary constraints, the alien was portrayed by actor Brandon deSpain in a costume. Release All Hallows' Eve was released on DVD and digital by Image Entertainment on October 29, 2013. It was first released on Blu-ray as a double feature with the 2013 film Mischief Night on September 9, 2014. Image re-released the film on DVD on September 13, 2016 as a double feature with the 2015 film All Hallows' Eve 2. All Hallows' Eve received a standalone Blu-ray release in August 2019. Critical reception All Hallows' Eve has received mixed reviews. Rod Lott of the Oklahoma Gazette wrote: \\"what All Hallows' Eve lacks in production value, writer/director/editor/makeup artist Damien Leone makes up for in pure passion. One can tell this guy loves the spirit of the season, and it shows in his terror trilogy, which has all the makings of becoming a minor cult hit.\\" A reviewer for Ain't It Cool News praised the character of Art the Clown, calling him \\"somewhat iconic\\" and \\"pretty terrifying\\", but criticized the film's \\"paper-thin\\" storyline, writing that \\"I can only imagine the fear would have been multiplied exponentially had the filmmakers spent as much time on the story as they did with coming up with the creepy as all get-out monster.\\" Madeleine Koestner of Fangoria wrote that the film's first segment \\"makes absolutely no sense\\", and went on to call the second segment \\"inexcusably uninteresting\\", referring to the third segment as \\"easily the best of the three.\\" She commended the special effects and character designs, and noted that \\"there's something legitimately creepy about this movie.\\" Brad McHargue of Dread Central gave the film a score of 3.5 out of 5, writing that Art could \\"be destined to become a horror icon\\", and concluding: \\"Through all of its flaws, [...] All Hallows' Eve shows tremendous talent both in front of and behind the camera. [...] while it's not a perfect film, it hints at a promising future for Leone and, if we're lucky, Art the Clown.\\" Adrian Halen of HorrorNews.net called it \\"easily one of the scariest films I've seen this year\\", writing that it \\"tends to transcend its own setting by playing on viewers fears and sense of nightmarish realism.\\" Tom Becker of DVD Verdict criticized the film's \\"unimaginative writing, uninspired acting, and tacky effects\\", and wrote that \\"It's not a bad film, especially, just not a particularly good or memorable one. [...] Worth a look if your cable is out and you've exhausted Netflix and Redbox.\\" Felix Vasquez Jr. of Cinema Crazed called the film \\"a pointless exercise in the anthology format with no real stand out stories, or performances in the bunch. Even with Generic the Clown acting as the basic clothesline for all of the tales, Damien Leone‚Äôs indie anthology horror film is a very forgettable and dull genre entry.\\" Sequel and spin-off All Hallows‚Äô Eve 2 is a standalone anthology film from Ruthless Pictures and producer/director Jesse Baget containing nine story segments, each with a different director. The film was released on VOD and digital on October 6, 2015, and had a DVD release on February 2, 2016. A spin-off, full-length film featuring \\"Art the Clown\\", titled Terrifier, was released in 2016.

Biography  Gottfried was born on September 15, 1925 in Glendale, Arizona, to Samuel Joy and Helen Young. She was the oldest of four children: Mariam, Helen and Samuel. As a child she showed a natural inclination for painting. While attending Stephens College for women in Columbia, Missouri, she met her husband, Mario H√©ctor Gottfried, a pilot of the U.S. Army Air Corps. and the two were married in January 1945, at a Methodist church in Glendale, Arizona. The couple lived in the United States before moving to Mexico City in 1945. They were married for more than 55 years, most of which were spent at their home in Coyoac√°n. Their four children, Mario H√©ctor, Maria Elena, Carlos Federico and Martha Cecilia were raised there. As a young mother in Mexico, Gottfried used drafts or watercolors as techniques. Martha Joy with Irene de Bohus in 1977. She took lessons with Martha Sauer (1953‚Äì1954) and Gordon D. Jones (1955‚Äì1956). Subsequently, she entered the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City, from 1958 to 1959. The sculptor Ignacio As√∫nsolo was also one of her teachers during this period. Over the years, she continued learning from other well-known artists, among them: Irene de Bohus (1959‚Äì1962), Toby Joysmith and Juan O'Gorman, who shared his tempera techniques with her. In 1974, Gottfried presented her first individual exhibition at a gallery in the Mexican-American Institute of Cultural Relations in Mexico City. In the ensuing years, she held many other exhibitions, including at the Instituto Anglo-Americano de Cultura; Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros (1983); Palacio de Miner√≠a(\\"Palace of Mining\\") (1992) and Museo de la Estampa (\\"Museum of Graphic Arts\\") (1994). She also held exhibitions at the M√©xico City and Canc√∫n, Quintana Roo Airports. In 2004, she exhibited at Palacio de la Escuela de Medicina (\\"Medical School Palace\\") and in 2007 at the Club de Industriales(\\"Industrial Club\\"), in Polanco. Besides her numerous exhibitions in and out of M√©xico, many of her paintings have been auctioned around the world. Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo receiving Martha's Joy painting in 1976. The Duke of Kent receiving one of Martha's Joy paintings (1978). Some of her works were acquired by distinguished institutions and notable persons. Among others, during an honorary ceremony held in M√©xico City's Iztapalapa in 1976, she presented a painting of the Valley of Mexico to Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo. In December 1978, the Duke of Kent received one of her paintings in a ceremony held by the British Chamber of Commerce in Mexico. It was estimated that Gottfried created around 700 paintings during the period 1969‚Äì1979. Much of her life was devoted to teaching in her own studio. After a long fight with chronic kidney disease, she died of a heart stoppage on January 10, 2014, at the age of 88 in Mexico City.  Pictorial work  Gottfried's work was inspired by light, weather and natural beauty in various places, such as Arizona, Himalayas and, particularly, Mexico. Her production is vast and punctuated by a strong interest in mountain ranges, deserts and majestic Mexican volcanoes, like the Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepetl of Central Mexico. In the words of the painter: Popocat√©petl & Iztacc√≠huatl (1997), by Martha Joy. \\"Distance, light, color, and vivid effect of these elements on a flat surface with pigments, is a continuous and enjoyable challenge. I try to capture the atmosphere of the places that I consider beautiful: mountains and deserts of Mexico are themes that I explore through my painting; its rugged and difficult terrain, the beauty of the shapes and textures of the earth, changes in color and light, as well as shadows, are a great subject for painters (to) enjoy during their lifetime.\\" Autumn Sonnet (Grand Topilejo) (1995), by Martha Joy. Fly by Popo (1994), by Martha Joy. Constant motifs in her paintings, such as Topilejo or the Valley of Mexico, are always shown in different seasons or perspectives. This inclination for exploring all the possibilities in landscapes, along with her many trips, whether by sea land or air, led the press to call her \\"painter of all seasons\\". During some years she was especially interested in making \\"skyscapes ... landscapes viewed from an airplane\\". She commonly used the \\"Ruben's technique\\" to paint, \\"a monochrome oil sketch is done on canvas while on location and back in the studio details can be filled in\\". The Cliff (1994), by Martha Joy. Nevado de Toluca (2008), by Martha Joy. Martha Joy besides one of her paintings in 1995. Her work, which includes hundreds of paintings and large-scale pieces, is significant to many art critics because, besides showing interesting ecological changes, it presents \\"factual responses to the natural scene\\". In this regard, Toby Joysmith states: \\"They present no intellectual problems, nor concepts, nor searching. They are effortless to look at. Direct transcription, devoid of transformation, will always give the pure pleasure of recognition, as these paintings most certainly do.\\"  Example of representative works  1980: San Miguel de Allende * 1987: North of Cave Creek * 1987: Topilejo * 1989: Iztacc√≠huatl summer * 1990: Urban sprawl * 1991: From Sierra Chincua * 1992: Popo & Izta * 1992: Ajusco * 1994: The Cliff * 1994: Road to Yautepec * 1994: Copper Canyon * 1994: Fly by Popo * 1994: Aerial of An√°huac * 1994: Zit√°cuaro Valley * 1995: Valley of South Mexico II * 1995: The Superstitions, Arizona * 1995: Donato Guerra * 1995: Autumn Sonnet (Grand Topilejo) * 1997: Popocat√©petl & Iztacc√≠huatl * 1997: Read Home(Topilejo) * 1997: Red Cliff * 2000: Valle de Bravo lake * 2004: Pinacate * 2008: Nevado de Toluca * 2009: Xitle  See also  Juan O'Gorman * Ignacio As√∫nsolo  References  Mexican women artists 20th-century Mexican painters American emigrants to Mexico 20th-century Mexican women artists 1925 births 2014 deaths ","title":"Martha Joy Gottfried"},{"id":"42952473","text":"Woree State School (WSS) is a public school situated in the southern suburbs of Cairns, North Queensland, Australia.

Rizal Avenue Extension in Barangay West Rembo, Makati, Philippines. History Ermita de San Nicolas de Tolentino was constructed on the expenses of Augustinian Friar Buenaventura de Bejar in 1686 and four years later was completed by Friar Diego de Yepes. The building have cogon-covered stone walls. The Legend of San Nicolas de Tolentino While the Augustinians actively promoted devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe in their monastery in Guadalupe, the Chinese faithful were very keen in their own devotion to Nicolas de Tolentino. According to legend, the Pasig River was inhabited by ferocious caiman, crocodiles which traverse the length of the river to and from the Laguna de Bay. A Chinese merchant who refused to be converted to the Christian faith while passing in front of the monastery of Guadalupe was almost caught by the devil disguised as a caiman to devour and bring to hell. Yet despite his being Pagan called to the saint venerated in the monastery, calling loudly, \\"San Nicolasi, San Nicolasi\\" and in uttering this prayer, the crocodile marvelously turned into stone and left the merchant safely. Due to this miracle the Chinese merchant converted to the Christian faith and in thanksgiving erected an ermita near the petrified caiman. In memory of the miracle, the Chinese held spectacular fluvial procession to the ermita. An Augustinian historian, Fray Joaquin Martinez de Zu√±iga, O.S.A. even noted the immensity of the celebrations that \\"more than a thousand kilos of candles were offered during these devotions.\\" However nothing remains of these devotions to San Nicolas de Tolentino with the petrified crocodile, popularly known as the buayang bato cemented over in the 1970s to beautify the Pasig, the old ermita ordered demolished and the image of the saint moved to the monastery in Guadalupe. The 300-year-old ermita however has been restored and is now under the jurisdiction of the Saint Therese of the Child Jesus Parish.

Poblacion, in San Rafael, Bulacan, Philippines. Its titular patron is St. John of God; Saint Raphael, archangel, is the secondary patron saint. It is in this church that the Battle of San Rafael took place, wherein hundreds of retreating Filipino soldiers and civilians lost their lives during a battle with the Spanish on November 30, 1896. A historical marker by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines was installed in front of the church in 1997 to commemorate the massacre of an estimated 800 Filipinos. History 1950s Archival photo of San Juan de Dios Church displayed at Museo San Rafael The town of San Rafael had its humble beginning as part of the Hacienda de Buenavista under the San Juan de Dios brothers. Though belonging to that religious group, the place was however administered by the Augustinian friars who established the mission in 1750. The date of the construction of the present stone church is debatable although some sources indicate that the convent was built in 1863, which can be assumed to be the time when the church was also being erected. Fray Antonio Piernavieja, OSA who served as parish priest from 1868 to 1873 and from 1875 to 1877 finished the convent. Rev. Fr. Ranielle Pineda is the church's present Parish Priest, and with Rev. Fr. Alvin Pila as Parochial Vicar. =Battle of San Rafael= Painting of the Battle of San Rafael 1896 The church is the site of the Battle of San Rafael, a battle fought between Filipino revolutionaries under the leadership of General Anacleto ‚ÄúMatanglawin‚Äù Enriquez against the Spanish army headed by Commandant Lopez Arteaga. On their way from the town of Paombong, Bulacan to the mountain ranges of Bulacan, General Isidoro Torres of Malolos decided to divide the troop of Katipuneros into two: one group under his supervision while the other under the guidance of General Enriquez and his brother Colonel Vicente Enriquez. The group of General Enriquez was supposedly heading to the town of Baliuag, Bulacan but decided to stay instead in San Rafael, believing it to be a strategic site. Unknowingly, a Spanish troop from Manila heading towards San Rafael, prepared to silence the 20,000 Filipino insurgents. The battle started at around 7 a.m. on November 30, 1896. The Spanish forces were so strong that General Enriquez ordered a retreat to the church of San Rafael. Sometime in the middle of the battle, some of the Filipino troops including Colonel Enriquez were separated from the rest of the group and headed to the town of Bigaa (now Balagtas). At around noon, the Spanish army forced the church doors open and murdered the Filipino revolutionaries seeking shelter in the church. It is estimated that 800 people were killed in the battle, most of whom were children, women and other locals. The number of casualties was so immense that it was believed that blood spilled in the church reached ankle-deep. The gobernadorcillo of San Rafael ordered a mass grave to be made near the church. It is believed that the Battle of San Rafael inspired the young general Gregorio Del Pilar (a close friend of General Anacleto Enriquez) to join the revolution against Spain. =Sisa, Basilio and Crispin in San Rafael= Residents of San Rafael believe that national hero Jose Rizal was inspired to create the characters Sisa, Basilio and Crispin (in his work Noli Me T√°ngere) by a real-life story in San Rafael. Recalling the story from Rizal's novel, the two brothers were serving as bell-ringers in the church to help their mother by earning money. On one occasion, the sacristan mayor accused Crispin of stealing an amount of money. Crispin was punished by the sacristan mayor and the town cure, Padre Salvi, and was believed to have died inside the church premises. As proof of the local legend, locals point to a blood-stained wall off the side of the convent in a small room where supposedly the young ‚ÄúCrispin‚Äù was tortured to death. Other local residents of San Rafael, Bulacan ponders some evidences that the town of San Rafael was the town of San Diego in Rizal's novel. They said that the name of Crisostomo Ibarra's father in the novel, \\"Rafael\\"came from the town original name San Rafael. Aside from that, there's a place in San Rafael \\"Pasong Intsik\\" or \\"Chinese Pass\\" were the early Chinese merchants of San Rafael resided. In the novel, Rizal told that Rafael's body was formerly buried in the San Diego cemetery before it was exhumed and thrown to the river. Architecture The San Juan de Dios Church is a classic example of Partido Baroque architecture in the Philippines. The style, popular from the early to mid-19th century, boasts of a curved fa√ßade as opposed to the flat ones typically found in other Baroque churches in the country. The church fa√ßade has two openings: a main portal now partially covered with a concrete portico and a semi-circular arch window in the center of the second level which provides light to the choir loft. The window is flanked by pairs of Tuscan-inspired columns extending up to the pediment and capped off by finials. The pediment has a niche in the center with an image of a saint. To the right of the church is the three-level octagonal belfry, the second and third levels of which are later additions to the earlier first level. Features =San Juan de Dios Parish Museum= The second level of the convent has been converted into a museum housing different historical artifacts and religious items. The Museo San Rafael was officially opened on September 29, 2006 during the feast of San Rafael, coinciding with the 256th founding anniversary of the town. Besides the main hall of the convent, three rooms now house different exhibits. The first room, named Museo ng Bayan (Museum of the Town) houses different Spanish-era items common to old San Rafael like an old rice mill, traditional clothes and house furniture. Located between the convent and the church is a small room containing a painting in memory of the characters Basilio and Crispin from Jose Rizal's Noli Me Tangere. A life-size statue of Jose Rizal can also be found inside the room. Farther inside the room, the deep crevice between the stone walls is said to be a well. In the next room, called Museo ng Simbahan (Museum of the Church) are collections of religious items including old stampitas and record books of the parish, a scaled replica of the church retablo, old santos, heavily embroidered vestments and an old episcopal chair. The third room, named Museo ng mga Anghel (Museum of the Angels) is an exhibit of different artworks of angels in recognition of the town's other patron saint, Archangel Raphael. The town has held the annual Angel festival every 29 September since 2002.

The biblical text is taken from , adding to the second half of the verse an often repeated \\"alleluia\\". Rutter scored the piece for four vocal parts (SATB) and organ, adding other versions. He composed it in 1994 for the Royal School of Church Music in England. The work was published by Oxford University Press in 1994. Marked \\"Brightly and serenely\\", the music is in A major and common time, and takes about three minutes to perform. Rutter also wrote a version for two upper voices and piano, and orchestral accompaniment for both versions. It is included in the collection John Rutter Anthems. It was recorded several times, for example ending a collection of Rutter's choral works performed under his direction by the Cambridge Singers and the City of London Sinfonia, featuring his Mass of the Children. It is part of the 2008 Anniversary Collection of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  Text and music  The text, with its juxtaposition of \\"spirit\\" and \\"understanding\\", interpreted also as \\"heart\\" and \\"mind\\", has been used by church musicians to reflect the synthesis of the two elements needed in good church music. Rutter chose the text, \\"mingling the heart and mind of worship music\\", well for a school of church music. In the four-part version, the soprano alone presents the first part of the text. \\"I will sing\\" leaps up a sixth to a long note on \\"sing\\", in a first repeat even up an octave, followed by a sequence of \\"alleluia\\". In a third repeat, all voices sing the first version in unison, then they perform in homophony the second version and the alleluia. In a middle section, the second part of the biblical text is sung three times, marked three times dolce e legato. The soprano, the alto, finally the men sing \\"with understanding also\\", culminating in a four-part lively alleluia. In a reprise section, the first line is repeated by all voices, with imitation of motifs.

Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44 differs from the rest of the L. bulgaricus strains as it was isolated from the leaves of Galanthus nivalis (snowdrop flower) in Bulgaria, becoming the only known strain of this subspecies that has vegan origin (not from yogurt) available as a commercial probiotic. Probiotics are health promoting bacteria which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a benefit on the host, normally associated with positive effects on the digestive and immune systems, and are usually prescribed during or after antibiotic treatment to alleviate the symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Probiotics are also associated with decreasing of the risk of traveler‚Äôs diarrhea. The natural habitat of the snowdrop flower are European mountainous regions. Thus, GLB44 is capable of surviving in freezing temperatures, as the snowdrop flowers between January and May in nature,,available on the electronic website: http://citesbulbs.myspecies.info/category/galanthus-wild-species/galanthus- alpinus when the temperatures can fall below freezing in this region. These characteristics of its natural habitat allows for GLB44 to survive in foods that are plant based and remain unaffected when stored in refrigerator temperatures. GLB44 has inhibitory qualities against other bacteria such as E. Coli and Salmonella spp. A research study was completed by a Harvard Medical School professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Andrew B. Onderdonk, PhD.Professional information for Professor Andrew Onderdonk is available on Channing Laboratory at Harvard Medical School website: The study has revealed GLB44's strength and effectiveness against bacterial pathogens. GLB44 has patent pending status in the US for its pathogen inhibitory qualities in vegan foods. Fig 2. Areas in yellow show the Galanthus nivalis distribution All other commercially available strains of L. bulgaricus are isolated from traditional yogurts and are grown in milk. Distinctly from the other L. bulgaricus, GLB44 grows very well in vegetable juices, given its natural plant habitat. Since all probiotics carry some of the organic matter in which they are grown, GLB44 carries traces of vegetable juice. GLB44 is currently grown in the European Union, in vegetable juice sourced from European farms that are GMO free.GMO Free Europe Conference (2012) Electronic Database: http://www.gmo-free-regions.org/gmo-free-regions/bulgaria.html Sourced originally from the leaves of the snowdrop flower, GLB44 differs significantly from other probiotics such as L. plantarum 299v or L. rhamnosus GG which are originally extracted from the human mouth.Goran Moulin (2010) Lactobacillus plantarum 299v as available on the manufacturer website: Others like Bifidobacterium are extracted from the feces of newborns, while others such as some strains of L. brevis come from the human vaginal canal. GLB44 does not have any interface with mammalian organs, only flower leaves and juice.GLB44 patent pending status as reported on the branded product website: www.proviotic.com This is important for multiple reasons such as the fact that there is some scientific evidence that if a probiotic grows in the human mouth naturally it could accelerate tooth decay. Also while many probiotics have major allergens in the growth solution, GLB44 has no major allergens as part of its growth medium.Mark Hyman (2014) \\"The Health Living Store\\" as available on the website: http://store.drhyman.com/Store/Show/ListAlphabetically/378/Culturelle-with- Lactobacillus-GG For example, the growth medium for L. plantarum 299v includes barley that has small content of gluten, and L. rhamnosus GG has small content of casein. The fact that GLB44 is grown in vegetable juice means GLB44 does not contain any of the seven major allergens for which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires additional labeling: lactose, gluten, soya, peanuts, tree nuts, fish or crustacean shellfish., Website Content: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/UCM220117.pdf It is estimated that 30 to 50 million Americans have some degree of lactose intolerance. Certain populations are more affected than others, including 75% of African American, Jewish, Mexican and Native American, and 90% of Asian populations.WebMD medical reference website content: http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-lactose- intolerance Thus, having probiotic bacteria such as GLB44 without any lactose is especially important for the lactose sensitive population. Another major difference is the safety track record of L. bulgaricus is now over 109 years since it was scientifically isolated. Even well established probiotics such as L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum 299v have only a fraction of the safety record with 31 years and 21 years, respectively.,Patent Search (2014) on the website: http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&NR;=4839281&KC;=&FT;=E&locale;=en_EP On the other hand, there are certain similarities between L. bulgaricus GLB44 and some of the other probiotics. For example, L. bulgaricus, L. rhamnosus GG and L. plantarum 299v all have scientific records of their ability to pass successfully through the gastrointestinal tract, Also they all have records to inhibit to a degree pathogenic bacteria., Finally, all three example probiotics in this comparison have all research tests performed by reputable academic professionals, for the case of GLB44, the research was performed by a Harvard Medical School professor, for the case of L. rhamnosus GG by two Tufts University professors, and for L. plantarum 299v by a professor at the Lund University. All three probiotics have commercial brand names in the United States. GLB44 is commercially available under the brand name ProViotic as a probiotic food supplement, L. rhamnosus GG as Culturelle, and L. plantarum 299v as the ingredient in GoodBelly.  History of discovery: the bacillus of long life  Living in a mountain village of Bulgaria with her son who was 101 years old, baba Vasilka‚Äôs age was not unusual for her community, which, of note, consumed yogurt containing L. bulgaricus as a dietary staple., The first L. bulgaricus was discovered more than a century ago, the result of a study into the unusual longevity of mountain villagers in Bulgaria (thus called L. bulgaricus) by Dr. Stamen Grigorov in 1905. In 1912, the New York Times wrote an overview article about the new discovery and the use of fermented yogurts with L. bulgaricus in Bulgaria titled ‚ÄúMetchnikoff Confirmed in His Theory of Long Life,‚Äù highlighting villager baba Vasilka, age 126, as the longest living person in the world. In fact, in these Bulgarian communities there were 3,000 centenarians from a population of 3 million ‚Äì six times higher than the number of centenarians per capita in the United States today. In the article the author described the discovery as follows: \\"In Bulgaria, the home of this bacillus, the majority of the natives live to age considerably in excess of what is recognized as the term of life among Western nations, an inquiry has shown that in the Eastern part of Southern Europe, among a population of about 3,000,000, there were more than 3,000 centenarians found performing duties which would not be assigned to a man of 65 years of age elsewhere. It is quite common to find among the peasants who live to such a large extent upon soured milk individuals of 110 and 120 years of age.\\" The article continues in the explanation of these facts: \\"Prof. √âlie Metchnikoff gave to the world the result of his investigation on the subject of longevity in which he held that the chief enemy to long life in the human species the large intestine, or colon. This organ by becoming the breeding place for poisonous microbes, the fertile cause for the debility that comes with old age, and the death that cuts off many a career of normal course is not nearly run.\\" \\"Acids are the best antiseptics; they have been used from time immemorial as preservatives; pickles are persevered with vinegar, acidic acid, and when milk is allowed to sour under proper conditions, the germs of putrefaction are destroyed or their activity inhibited, and it keeps a considerable time. How can acids be applied so as to control the bacterial flora of the large intestine? Not in the ordinary way because, when administered through the mouth, they are used up long before they can penetrate the colon. The brilliant idea occurred to Prof. Metchnikoff of the administering acid-producing germs which might work their way through the digestive system, and, reaching the large intestine, produce the acid required. After much experimenting, the bacillus of Massol, Bacillus Bulgaricus was adopted as the most suitable.\\" There is a complex interplay between the probiotic bacteria and the body's immune system in the large intestine, where the good bacteria stimulate the body's own immune system to inhibit the pathogenic bacteria. For example, in a controlled study, 61 elderly volunteers, after 6 months of a daily dose of L. bulgaricus, responded to the intake of probiotic with an increase in the percentage of NK cells, an improvement in the parameters defining the immune risk profile (IRP), and an increase in the T cell subsets that are less differentiated. The probiotic group also showed decreased concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 but increased antimicrobial peptide hBD-2.  GLB44 studies at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital  Dr. Andrew Onderdonk, a Pathology Professor at Harvard Medical School and a Director of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Brigham and Women‚Äôs hospital has published one of his research tests on the following website: www.glb44.org, where GLB44 is tested against bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella sp. and E. Coli. In his study, both Salmonella sp. and E. Coli are inhibited when mixed with GLB44 in vegetable juice. The study confirms that GLB44 is a specific strain of the L. bulgaricus subspecies, and that its inhibitory power surpasses other L. bulgaricus strains.  Scientific studies on effects  These studies do not involve significant human trials sufficient for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow representative health claims, nevertheless, these studies, performed in reputable academic institutions, provide an insight on some of the properties of this bacteria: #The scientific study \\"In Vitro Cholesterol Uptake by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus Isolates\\" performed at the University of Warsaw proved that L. bulgaricus has the ability to uptake cholesterol from its environment. #Helicobacter pylori bacterial infection is associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. The scientific study \\"Anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains\\" performed by the Medical University of Sofia concluded that all tested L. bulgaricus strains inhibited a number of H. pylori strains. #In 2010, the British Journal of Nutrition reported a study that included fifty-seven elderly individuals (mean age 74) and eighty five healthy individuals (mean age 67), who consumed L. bulgaricus every day over 12 week period. The result of the study clearly showed that people who consumed L. bulgaricus daily had 2.6 times lower incidence of catching a cold. The study concluded that the consumption of yogurt fermented with L. bulgaricus augmented natural killer cell activity and reduced the risk of catching the common cold in elderly individuals. #The Federal Research Centre for Nutrition in Germany reported that consuming L. bulgaricus on regular basis is associated with anticarcinogenic effects, one mechanism of which is the detoxification of genotoxins in the gut. This mechanism was shown experimentally in animals with use of the rat colon carcinogen, with endpoints that ranging from tumorigenesis to induction of DNA damage. #The Journal of Dairy Science reports that L. bulgaricus can act as a suppressant of allergic inflammation. Allergic inflammation is an important pathophysiological feature of several disabilities or medical conditions including allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and several ocular allergic diseases., #Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of Antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and the resulting C. difficile mediated infection (CDI) is potentially deadly. C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) is manifested by severe inflammation and colitis, mostly due to the release of two exotoxins by C. difficile that cause destruction of epithelial cells in the intestine. The study ‚ÄúLactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B-30892 can inhibit cytotoxic effects and adhesion of pathogenic Clostridium difficile to Caco-2 cells‚Äú demonstrates that L. bulgaricus can reduce the colonization of C. difficile cells in colorectal cells, and thus prevent Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea.  Safety of use  Due to more than a century of safe use, the FDA has granted L. bulgaricus a \\"grandfather\\" status, with an automatic GRAS status (Generally Recognized as Safe). Moreover, the Code of Federal Regulations mandates that in the US, for a product to be called yogurt, it must contain two specific strains of lactic acid bacteria: Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, as regulated by the FDA. Even as a direct supplement, L. bulgaricus has a track record of safe use for more than 60 years in the United States. For example, the supplement Lactinex with a different strain of L. bulgaricus has been marketed as a commercial product in the US market since 1952.United States Patent and Trademark Office (2014) Lactinex Search at USPTO website: http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/ Despite not being vegan, and grown in milk, Lactinex shows a long history of L. bulgaricus as a food supplement in the United States. For the last 100 years there has been not a case of overdose on probiotics, which substantiates L. bulgaricus GLB44 as an extremely safe product, without limitations of the quantity consumed. It is also recommendable for the elderly as it helps reduce infections such as the common cold, as well as for young children (i.e. when they suffer from acute diarrhea). Harvard Women's Health Watch, published by Harvard Medical School, recommends a GLB44 dose range of between 1 and 10 billion colony forming units (CFU) per day, the amount contained in a capsule or two several days a week. GLB44 is not a bacteria that can live naturally in the human mouth, as presented by the Human Oral Microbiome Database.Chen T, Dewhirst F, Izard J, Paster J, Tanner A, Wade W (2014) \\"Human Oral Microbiome Database\\" available on the electronic website: www.homd.org A study conducted by the University of Texas uncovered that while a bacteria called S. mutans is the biggest culprit for tooth decay, various lactobacilli are also associated with the progression of lesions. GLB44 does not increase the risk of tooth decay due to its inability to live in the human mouth, an advantage versus other probiotics that contain any of the following lactobacilli that live naturally in the human mouth and could contribute to the tooth decay: L. acidophilus, L. brevis, L. casei, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. paracasei, L plantarum, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus, L. salivarius  L. bulgaricus GLB44 and the definition of probiotics  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has presented on their website the following guideline: ‚ÄúGuidance for Industry on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Products and Their Regulation by the Food and Drug Administration‚Äù In this article, the definition of \\"Probiotics\\" is twofold: 1) live microbial food supplements that beneficially affect the host by improving its intestinal microbial; 2) live microorganisms which, when consumed in adequate amounts of food, confer a health benefit on the host. Another guideline presented on the FDA website \\"Guidelines for Evaluation of Probiotics in Food\\"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Health Organization (2002) \\"Guidelines for the Evaluation of Probiotics\\" available on the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/95s0316/95s-0316-rpt0282-tab-03-ref-19-joint- faowho-vol219.pdf has outlined more specific criteria for the definition of effective probiotic based on the following criteria: * Resistance to gastric acidity * Bile acid resistance * Adherence to mucus and/or human epithelial cells and cell lines * Antimicrobial activity against potentially pathogenic bacteria * Ability to reduce pathogen adhesion to surfaces * Bile salt hydrolase activity Of note, the authors of this guideline specifically outline L. bulgaricus as an example of an effective probiotic with suitable scientific substantiation of health benefits. Resistance to gastric acid and bile acid are scientifically presented in the following studies where L. bulgaricus successfully passes through the human intestinal tract, maintaining its viability: ‚ÄúSurvival of Yogurt Bacteria in the Human Gut‚Äù and ‚ÄúLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus Collection to select a strain able to survive to the human intestinal tract.‚Äù. Adherence to mucus and human epithelial cells and cell lines and the ability to reduce pathogen adhesion to surfaces is scientifically proven by the research \\"Influence of Gastrointestinal System Conditions on Adhesion of xopolysaccharide-producing Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains to Caco-2 Cells\\" There are also numerous studies that outline the antimicrobial activity of L. bulgaricus against potentially pathogenic bacteria such as E. Coli, Salmonella sp., S. aureus, V. cholera, B. subtilis, C. difficile and others. Thus, the L. bulgaricus meets all the criteria of the FDA probiotic guideline, with scientific evidence supporting the strain as the clearest example of a safe and effective probiotic food supplement.

She in turn is left alone in that last scene with her jackal fur wrapped around her shoulders, failing to pull together her family life or her work life, left in a trance, bleak and abandoned.\\" References 1975 births Namibian women writers Living people Namibian critics Namibian short story writers People from Omaruru 21st-century women writers Women critics Namibian women short story writers 21st-century translators Namibian translators 21st- century short story writers 20th-century Namibian writers 21st-century Namibian writers 20th-century Namibian women writers 21st-century Namibian women writers ","title":"Sylvia Schlettwein"},{"id":"42953007","text":"M.E.A.T. is a single released by the US musical group Tomahawk.

It was built when the arrabal (suburb) of Santa Cruz was established by the Jesuits in the early 17th century. The church had undergone many repairs and reconstruction, with the last reconstruction done in the 1950s. It is the first Mission and Mother house of Filipino Sacramentinos, making it as the center of Congregation Activities and events The church fa√ßade is topped with a statue of Our Lady of the Pillar, the patroness of the church, whose feast is held every 3rd Sunday of October. On 7 December 2017 Pope Francis granted the Canonical coronation of the venerated image. The current parish priest is Fr. Rudsend P. Paragas, SSS. On June 3, 2018, as part of the Church-wide celebrations of Corpus Christi, it was officially raised to an Archdiocesan Shrine by the decree of the Archbishop of Manila, Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, in the Archdiocese-wide holiday mass held in the church.  Architecture  The Jesuits built the first Catholic church in the area where the present Santa Cruz Parish stands on June 20, 1619. The original church design was made of stone and wood.Olb√©s, p. 14. The Jesuits enshrined the image of Our Lady of Pilar in 1643 to serve the predominantly Chinese residents in the area. The first church was made of stone and wood was built in the 17th century. On June 3, 1863 an earthquake destroyed the church. Fr. Agustin de Mendoza began reconstruction work on the church in 1868. The church facade is characteristically Baroque with Ionic piers vertically dividing the first two levels in three parts. Three semicircular arch doorways form as main entrance to the church. A Celtic-like window flanked by small semicircular windows is found at the center of the second level. Forming as the pediment, the topmost level has its raking cornice in undulating liens emanating from the broken pediment found above the statued niche. The domed belfry rises on the right in six levels. The original structure of the church was twice damaged by earthquakes and then completely destroyed during the Battle of Manila.

Biography Branham was born July 25, 1888, in Oxford, Georgia to mother Sarah (\\"Sallie\\") Stone and father Junius Branham. Although education of women was not commonplace at the time, members of Sara Branham's family were firm believers in the value of education for women. Following in the footsteps of her mother (Amanda Stone Branham, 1885 graduate) and grandmother (Elizabeth Flournoy Stone, 1840 graduate), she attended Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia and graduated with a B.S. degree in biology in 1907 as a third generation alumna. She was a member of Alpha Delta Pi.The Adelphean of Alpha Delta Pi. v. 11 (Jan.-Oct. 1918), p. 58. With few professional opportunities offered to women with an education then, she became a schoolteacher, working for ten years in Georgia's public school system in Sparta, Decatur, and finally at Atlanta's Girls' High School. In the summer of 1917, Sara began taking classes at the University of Colorado to expand her education, but within a few weeks, she was hired by the University of Colorado in 1917 as a bacteriology teacher, since there was a shortage of men from the department during World War I. She remarked on the change of roles: \\"When I had had about six weeks of bacteriology, they offered me a job to teach it! \\" She completed a second B.S. degree at the university in 1919, majoring in chemistry and zoology, and stated that \\"When the war was over, I was too deep in bacteriology to ever get out again.\\" After finishing her degree in Colorado in 1919, she went to Chicago during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 with a desire to enter the field of medical research. She enrolled at the University of Chicago where she would eventually complete, all with honors, a M.S. degree, a Ph.D. degree in bacteriology, and a M.D. degree. Her advisor at the university suggested that she study the etiology of influenza for her thesis. Therefore, in pursuit of her degrees at the University of Chicago, she studied filterable agents (viruses), and published over a dozen papers on the topic. This work eventually earned Branham a position as instructor in the Department of Hygiene and Bacteriology. In 1927, Branham left Chicago and began working as an associate at the University of Rochester School of Medicine under Stanhope Bayne-Jones. Shortly thereafter, the outbreak of meningococcus arrived in California from China. Because of this, Branham's career shifted paths, and she began working for what is now the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (then, known as the Hygienic Laboratory of the United States Public Health Service) in Bethesda, Maryland as a senior bacteriologist, in order to study meningococcus. Branham stayed at the NIH for the rest of her career. She remained in the role for over 25 years until she was promoted to the Chief of Bacterial Toxins of the Division of Biological Standards in 1955. Branham married retired businessman Philip S. Matthews in 1945. Matthews died four years later. Branham retired from the NIH in 1958 at the age of seventy from the position of Chief of the Section on Bacterial Toxins, and died November 16, 1962 after a sudden heart attack. She is buried in Oxford, Georgia in her family's plot. Broadly, Sara Branham's research was based in the field of infectious diseases, including influenza, salmonella, shigella, diphtheria, dysentery, and psittacosis. She studied the toxins produced by Shigella dysenteriae. The main focus of Branham's work at the NIH, however, was meningitis. This focus was Branham responding to what was quickly becoming a health crisis: an untreatable form of meningitis had arrived in the United States and began spreading quickly. She is credited with the discovery and isolation of Neisseria meningitidis. Neisseria is a common causative organism of meningitis, and its taxonomy is well characterized by Branham throughout her work. She also discovered that the infection could be treated with sulfa drugs rather than antiserums that were used at the time, but that were ineffective in treating this strain. Branham was considered an international expert on the strain of disease: due to her great contributions to the knowledge about it, Neisseria catarrhalis was renamed Branhamella caterrhalis in 1970, years after Branham's death. The new name was officially accepted in the 1974 edition of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Branham's studies in infectious disease were nationally known, and she came to be considered as one of the \\"grand ladies of microbiology\\". In a biographical article about Branham published in the Atlanta Constitution, the huge impact of her work was summarized in the exclamation: \\"She killed millions of killers!\\" Alongside her busy professional life, Sara Branham played an active role in the community. She is regarded as a very influential woman that inspired those who worked with her throughout her career. She gave back to her alma mater by being an active alumna and supporter, returning for reunions and serving as alumna trustee from 1936 to 1939. She was a featured speaker for several events and gave many lectures, including two in 1960 just a couple years before she died. She was also active in many scientific societies. She contributed to what is now the American Society for Microbiology (then, known as the Society of American Bacteriologists). She was a delegate at the First and Second International Congresses in Microbiology in 1930 (Paris) and 1936 (London). She served as a diplomat on both the American Board of Pathology in the field of Clinical Microbiology and the National Board of Medical Examiners. One of Branham's colleagues remarked that Branham was equally comfortable entertaining in a chiffon dress and in a lab coat. She was known to be meticulous about her home and lawn, and was an avid ornithologist and gardener. Awards and honors Branham was awarded the Howard Taylor Ricketts Prize in 1924 from the University of Chicago. Wesleyan College's Alumnae Association began recognizing the distinguished achievement of their individual alumnae in 1950. In the inaugural year, Branham was honored with Wesleyan College's first Distinguished Service Award in 1950. She later received a similar award from the University of Chicago Medical School Alumni Association. She was also awarded an honorary doctor of science from the University of Colorado, which would be the last of six total degrees she earned in her life. In 1959, she was honored as the American Medical Women's Association's Medical Woman of the Year. In a similar fashion as the honor from Wesleyan, Branham was honored in Georgia Women of Achievement's first class of inductees in 1992. Over the course of her career, she published eighty papers and helped with the composition of many textbooks. Her papers are held at the National Library of Medicine.

The district consists of two major neighborhoods: San Juan Arriba (Upper San Juan), and San Juan Abajo (Lower San Juan). History Like the rest of the canton, before the Spanish settlers came, Santa B√°rbara was originally occupied by the Huetares, an indigenous tribe. The Huetare King, Cacique Garabito, dominated the area. When the Spanish arrived, they originally called the area Churruca or Surruco. Heredia, Barva, and Alajuela, three neighboring cities, were populated and settled in the late 1700s. As trade increased between the three cities, the canton developed. In 1836, an Englishman named John Hale sold his land to residents of what is now San Juan. The land was bought using profits from the sugarcane that was grown at the time. On 7 December 1848, the fourth canton of Heredia was created, with San Juan as a founding district. In 1852, Horacio Morales helped build the first chapel in San Juan, although many parishioners still went to Santa B√°rbara. By 1885, the district educated as many boys as girls, with schools for both. San Juan inaugurated the canton's first hydroelectric plant in 1914 along the Porrosat√≠ River that separates the districts of Santa B√°rbara and San Juan. During Ricardo Jim√©nez Oreamuno second term in office, between 1924 and 1928, water delivery systems were installed in San Juan using water from the Potrerillos River. Economy San Juan's main economic activity is agricultural production, particularly coffee. In 1973, 1,074 kilograms of coffee were produced in San Juan. Because of a sawmill in the district, another important activity was lumber production. There are various commercial businesses in San Juan, including restaurants and corner stores. There is a coffee processing facility in San Juan which serves many local farmers. San Juan is locally known for a ceviche restaurant near its central plaza. Culture and education San Juan was featured in an episode of Repretel's \\"Informe Once\\" (Eleven Report). The episode described several cottage industries in the district, including an agricultural producer and an ice- cream maker, as well as a country house in the traditional Costa Rican adobe and cane style. There are two private schools in San Juan: Colegio Biling√ºe Nueva Esperanza (New Hope Bilingual High School), where 590 students attended in 2009, and Puente Verde (Green Bridge). Colegio Biling√ºe Nueva Esperanza, founded in 1993, was the first private technical school in the country, meaning students received specialized in computer skills. The main public elementary school is Tranquilino Saenz Rojas. Students from San Juan usually attend Colegio Santa B√°rbara High School,Ministerio de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica: Santa B√°rbara  Ministerio de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica , accessdate: 27 May 2014 but may also go to the high schools in Alajuela. In 2012, resident Noelia Villalobos Sol√≥rzano received the Panamanian Rub√©n Dar√≠o Prize for her work in education. Administration San Juan is served by the police force of Heredia. An EBAIS, Equipo B√°sico de Atenci√≥n Integral en Salud (Basic Medical Care Center), is located in San Juan, serving residents and non-residents of the district. In addition, there is a private nursing home located in the district. The canton has investigated the possibility of making microbusiness outreach to the residents of San Juan, especially toward women and artisans. The canton's first priority, however, is to build a police station within the district. Geography San Juan has an area of km¬≤ and an elevation of metres. It has the lowest elevation of the canton. It is directly south of the municipality of Santa B√°rbara de Heredia, divided into two main neighborhoods: San Juan Arriba (Upper San Juan), and San Juan Abajo (Lower San Juan). In addition, there are other neighborhoods: Cinco Esquinas (Five Points), Villa Margarita, Tierra Santa (Holy Land), Calle Zapote (Zapote Street), and several developments. Routes 123 and 119 pass through San Juan. The Zanj√≥n River, Quebrada la Claudia, and Porrosat√≠ River run through San Juan. During the rainy season, San Juan is subject to flooding, as was the case in May 2014 when more than 100 houses were affected by clogged drainage systems. Like much of Costa Rica, San Juan is part of a high-risk zone, according to the Comisi√≥n Nacional de Prevenci√≥n de Riesgos (National Risk Prevention Commission).

The mixtape also features use of various samples. At least four tracks use samples from The Diplomats album, Diplomatic Immunity and the track \\"Lil B\\" uses the beat from LL Cool J's 1999 FUBU commercial song \\"Fatty Girl.\\" The track, \\"Im the Rap God\\", features Lil B rapping over the instrumental version of System of a Down's 2001 song, \\"Toxicity\\", which was described as \\"a drunken-style karaoke freestyle\\" and \\"your friend's blunt-smoking roommate doing an impression of MC Ride on the choruses.\\" The track, \\"G.O.R. (God of Rap)\\" lasts for ten minutes and starts with a sample from 1991 film Barton Fink, accompanied by atmospheric guitar and drum beat, before evolving into a sample by symphonic metal band Nightwish. \\"Twurk Sum\\" contains an interpolation of \\"Homelife is a Drag\\" by punk band No-Cash.

Weingarten of Rolling Stone described the album as \\"his grandest gesture yet.\\" He commented that \\"the mixtape reaches the highest highs of the best Lil B songs,\\" while criticizing the \\"id-fueled\\" sexual fantasies, which he thought \\"end up stealing the spotlight from an album that's at its best when showing its sensitive core.\\" Track listing # \\"Intro\\" ‚Äì 3:15 # \\"Welcome To 05\\" ‚Äì 2:38 # \\"4 My\\" ‚Äì 3:34 # \\"So Thirsty\\" ‚Äì 4:23 # \\"Strip You\\" ‚Äì 3:06 # \\"Lil B\\" ‚Äì 6:15 # \\"Liii\\" ‚Äì 3:08 # \\"Twurk Sum\\" ‚Äì 2:52 # \\"Lil B's Layer\\" ‚Äì 3:05 # \\"Goin' Platinum\\" ‚Äì 1:54 # \\"No Mo Blow\\" ‚Äì 3:46 1.780 # \\"G.O.R.

Family and biography Watercolour by Heathcote of the grounds of Conington Castle, 1900 Norman Heathcote was the second child and eldest son of John Moyer Heathcote (1834‚Äì1912) and Louisa Cecilia MacLeod (1838‚Äì1910) who married in 1860. His father (whose mother was the youngest daughter of Nicholas Ridley-Colborne, 1st Baron Colborne) was a barrister and distinguished amateur player of real tennis. His mother was the eldest child of Norman Macleod, 25th chief of Clan Macleod. As a child Norman lived in London, Brighton and at Conington Castle. Heathcote was born in 1863 and attended Eton College and then Trinity College, Cambridge from 1882, where he took a BA degree in 1885. He became a Justice of the Peace in 1906 and was High Sheriff of Huntingdonshire in 1917/18. On his father's death in 1912, he inherited Conington Castle, Conington, Huntingdonshire with its estate of over and lived there for many years. He also inherited the lordship of the manor of Steeple Gidding which he sold to a Mr Tower in 1915. In 1933 he owned a steam yacht called Ketch. reproducing Oban Times. 12 August 1933 He did not marry or have children. He died in 1946 and is buried in Conington churchyard. St Kilda Norman Heathcote's Map of St Kilda =St Kilda= In 1898 and again in 1899 Heathcote visited the archipelago with his sister, Evelyn. At that time St Kilda was owned by his uncle, Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod.Evelyn was three years younger. He also had an elder sister who died in 1880 and a younger brother. He went on to write a book about the islands which was published in London by Longmans, Green in 1900 and reprinted in 1985.It has since become available by print on demand by Nabu Press, and others. It included eighty of his own illustrations ‚Äì photographs (taken with a handheld camera), sketches, paintings and a map. He was the first to record several bird species on the islands. The book deals with the people of St Kilda, their history and customs; the wildlife (particularly birds) and his and his sister's experiences boating and climbing with the St Kildans. Photogravure \\"Boating in St Kilda\\" (from St Kilda) In 1898 Heathcote and his sister arrived after a four-hour voyage on the Martin Orme steamer SS Dunara Castle for a stay of ten days. Dunara and the McCallum steamer Hebrides between them visited about once a fortnight but only in the three summer months. There were about twenty visitors, some were tourists but others had arrived to start building the new schoolhouse ‚Äì until that time lessons had been given in the kirk. In 1898 Evelyn laid the foundation stone and by the time of their 1899 visit the school had been completed and the kirk had been completely renovated.Services (in Gaelic) lasted from two hours to over three hours. The resident population numbered seventy and most spoke only Gaelic although the children were taught English at school.Evelyn had some knowledge of Gaelic. Photograph of Stack Lee (from \\"Climbing in St Kilda\\") In 1899 their visit lasted two months and in July Heathcote and Evelyn were rowed to Boreray and from there they together climbed the sea stack Stac Lee. He wrote that Stac Lee was \\"not a difficult climb\\" and that, before Evelyn, two other women had reached the summit. However, after exploring Boreray and setting off to row back to the main island, Hirta, the weather deteriorated and they were forced to spend the night in their boat, sheltering in a sea cave on Boreray. When he visited Stac Levenish he was told he was the first person who was not a St Kildan ever to have been there. Unable to board the boat again, he had to climb the stack so as to descend on the other side where the boat could be in more sheltered water. He considered the most difficult stack to climb was Stac Biorach, saying that Richard Manliffe Barrington was the only non-St Kildan to have climbed it.Heathcote did not climb Biorach. =Journal articles= Landing on Stac Lee (from \\"Climbing in St Kilda\\") He also published a paper \\"A Map of St Kilda\\" in the Geographical Journal of 1900 describing his surveying methods in producing the map that was included in the St Kilda book.The map was in both book and journal. In the book he thanks the Royal Geographical Society for permission to publish it. Except at Village Bay on Hirta it is difficult to climb down to the shore and indeed from the top of the cliffs it is often impossible to conveniently see the coast. At Soay and Boreray he did not even try to get his theodolite ashore. A year later in \\"Climbing in St Kilda\\" in the Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal he gave an account of his experiences climbing. He gave details of climbing Stac Lee saying it was \\"comparatively easy\\" although getting ashore onto the stack was \\"a most appalling undertaking\\" involving jumping ashore and climbing an overhanging cliff covered in slippery seaweed to a stanchion above sea level. He recommended taking off boots and climbing in socks.

It is a remake of the 1957 B-movie Reform School Girl. Plot Donna seeks to escape her life of avoiding the advances of her legal guardian, her lecherous uncle, and takes a ride in a stolen car with bad boy Vince, who gets them involved in a hit-and-run accident. Unable to escape, she is sent to McCarthy Reform School for Wayward Girls to take the fall for Vince because she does not know his last name and cannot identify him, but she is most upset that her uncle will now turn his attention toward her younger sister Cathy. Donna is befriended by a kleptomaniac nicknamed \\"Dink\\" on the way to the reform school and once there she meets the other girls. She resists the advances of the school psychologist, who accuses her of throwing herself at him in order to get her sent to solitary confinement. During an exercise break, her speed is noticed by Coach Buxbaum and reported to Headmistress Turnbull, an Olympic medal-winner who offers Donna early release if she wins a track competition at Velmont Academy, a girls' prep school in Hillsdale. Turnbull gives a silver medallion to Priscilla for running, but when Priscilla finds that Dink has stolen it she fights her and Dink injures Priscilla's knee. Dink is sent away and Priscilla is left unable to compete. Donna becomes intimate with Carmen Pe√±a, who is the fastest girl at the reform school but refuses to compete for Headmistress Turnbull because she does not want to owe her anything. Vince befriends Cathy, then visits Donna in prison and explains that he was arrested for grand theft auto and the police are trying to connect him to the hit-and-run incident. He warns Donna that he will hurt her sister if she talks to the police about him. After seeing how upset Donna is after a visit from her uncle and sister, Turnbull knows that Donna wants to call her sister but revokes her phone privileges to motivate her to compete, so Carmen calls Cathy and tells her about money hidden behind Donna's mirror. When Cathy finds the money, her uncle tries to take it from her but Cathy sprays him in the eyes with perfume and escapes with the money to take a bus to Kansas. Priscilla reports Donna and Carmen's lovemaking to Turnbull but only Carmen is punished so that Donna can still compete in Kansas. At the competition, Donna wins a race while Velmont student Jody Beaumont wins the hurdles event and breaks the record in the long jump. The final event is the 4 √ó 440 yards relay, where Donna and Jody are put in the final slot against one another. They shake hands, receive the batons, and Donna overtakes Jody. Just before the finish line she remembers what Carmen said and how Dink was sent away. Instead of crossing the finish line, she stops and gives the finger to Turnbull. Jody comes from behind and wins. Back at the reform school she receives a letter from her sister that she is safe in Kansas.

It is situated next to the Taguig River and across Plaza Quezon, where the statue of the late President Manuel L. Quezon was erected when he was still serving as President of the Republic. Saint Anne is the patroness of the church.  History  = Building of the church = Church door In 1571, the Spaniards subjugated mainland Luzon including Taguig through the Legazpi expedition. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig became part of the Encomienda del Tondo and was under the headship of an Alcalde Mayor, Captain Vergara. Taguig was eventually established as a separate town in 1587 and was declared a parish with St. Anne as its chosen patroness. Augustinian friars, Fr. Diego Alvarez and his assistant, Fr. Diego de Avila, were assigned to begin religious activities in Taguig. Arched entrance to St. Anne Parish Church The first concrete church for use of the faithful was built by Fray Hernando Guerrero, O.S.A. in 1609. However the 1645 Luzon earthquake caused it considerable damage. In 1848, Fray Andres Diaz, O.S.A. began the construction of a new church complex. This too, unfortunately was destroyed by the tremor of 1882. To continue administering to the spiritual needs of the faithful, a makeshift church was used until the construction of a permanent one. Construction of the present church started during the term of Fray Patricio Martin, O.S.A. in 1883. He however did not see its completion due to his early demise. His successor, Fray Guillermo Diaz, O.S.A. continued with the project and saw its eventual completion. During the early American Period, secular priest of the Archdiocese of Manila succeeded the Augustinian Friars in Taguig. The first of these was Father Silbino Labao of Tipas. He was followed by Fr. Vicente Estacio of Tipas who oversaw the installation of the church's sawali ceiling. Fr. Gerardo Maximo completed the rehabilitation of the church. More improvements in the edifice were undertaken by Msgr. Augurio Juta and Msgr. Emmanuel Sunga in preparation for the parish's 400th anniversary in 1987. = Japanese Occupation of Rizal = In 1942, the Japanese invaded the province of Rizal and established garrisons in the town. The church was remembered as the place where hundreds of male inhabitants were incarcerated for a number of days on August 1943. = Present = The current parish priest of Saint Anne Parish Church is Rev. Fr. Renier Noel N. Llorca. The church houses the Museo De Sta. Ana, which contains religious relics and repository of artifacts detailing the rich religious culture and history of Taguig since 1857. On July 26 of each year, the Saint Anne Parish Church along with the City Government, celebrates Sta. Anang Banak Taguig River Festival which is a fluvial parade in honor of the town patroness, St. Anne. The thrills and excitement of the fishers are replayed each year by the \\"pasubo\\" where fluvial parade participants in colorful boats and spectators by the riverbanks toss goodies of fruits and native delicacies to each other. Aside from the July festivities which is also the Liturgical Feast of Sts. Joachim and Anne, another feast is celebrated annually on the Sunday before Ash Wednesday. It is called the Pistang Pasasalamat (Thanksgiving Feast), locally known as Pistang Bayan ng Taguig (Taguig Town Fiesta). It is a celebration in honor of St. Anne as a form of thanksgiving, especially on how her intercession paved the way to the liberation of Taguig from the hands of the Japanese forces.  Architecture  According to Architect Manuel Maximo Lopez Del Castillo Noche, a member of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), the structure of the church follows the barn-style Baroque architecture design \\"with its very defined articulation of both vertical and horizontal bays topped by a simple triangular pediment.\\"  Cemetery  Among the notable features of the church complex of Santa Ana in Taguig is the old funerary chapel. Constructed in the 1700s using Filipino forced labor, the chapel is made up of tiles and walls of stones. It measures 12 meters in diameter with its ground level reserved as repository for bones. Despite minor repairs in 1980 and in 1993, the Simborio, as it is called, stands beautiful yet quaint in the old cemetery of the parish.  Declaration as a Historic Site and Cultural Property  Simbahan ng Taguig Historical Marker On July 25, 1987, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines installed a marker on Saint Anne Parish Church for its historical value and patriotic endeavors to dramatize the need to focus to the national consciousness the history of the country from the Filipino viewpoint and to evoke pride in the national heritage and identity. The church was also declared and recognized by the government as a cultural property based on the official list provided by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, National Historical Commission of the Philippines and the National Museum of the Philippines.

Dispatch work agencies receive requests from businesses to have them hire and manage labor on the business' behalf. This type of labor is known as \\"dispatched labor\\". There is in fact no direct contract between dispatched laborers and the enterprise which uses the agency's services, so in this way, dispatched employment follows a triangle structure. As dispatch agencies are often highly adept in hiring and managing workforces, businesses are more than happy to use an agency to manage part of their workforce as it saves time, money, and if you are a foreign enterprise, the hassle of quickly understanding the legal workings of a local labor force. History ILO 181 =1920s ~ 1940s - Initial germinating stages= The earliest labor dispatching came out in London, UK before World War I, but the form of labor dispatch at that time was different from nowadays. In addition to labor dispatching, it also contained the job of private placement agencies. The initial development of labor dispatch originated from the 1920s. Samuel Workman created the idea of \\"rented help\\". Samuel hired began by hiring married women to make inventory at night in order to meet temporary or short-term demand of enterprises at that time. =1940s ~ 1980s - Growth stage= At this time, labor dispatching was popularized in America, Japan and all over Europe. The most important and common labor dispatching in America was founded in 1946 to 1951. For example, the biggest dispatched work agency at present, Manpower, was founded in 1948. According to statistics from NAPEO, the growth of labor dispatching in the US keeps to roughly 20% per year. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Belgium, France, UK, the Netherlands, Norway and America already had the service of labor dispatching, and most well-established dispatched work agencies were founded at during this period. In Japan, labor dispatching emerged in 1965. Employers of dispatched work agencies already hired or registered a certain amount of laborers and dispatched them to the users enterprise to provide labor services when the enterprise was in demand. At that time, labor dispatching played as matchmaker between females, older workers and dispatched work agencies. After 1975, due to the rising demand of many enterprises, dispatched work agencies grew rapidly. =1980s ~ 1990s - Stable stage= In 1980s, labor dispatching starting blossoming and developing in America, partly due to a high post-war employment rate. The labor market of America also faced a structural change. With the rapid development and the stability of social environment, enterprises started to pursue the goal of maximum profits and minimum costs. At the same time, enterprises also started to pursue a labor force that can adopt quickly to market variations. Enterprises attached more importance to the flexibility of human resource utilization. Japan made the law of labor dispatching for the first time in July, 1985. The Ministry of Labor started to formulate a chain of detailed bylaws and executive orders, and entered the era of legal labor dispatching in 1, July, 1986. =1990s ~ nowadays - Rapid growth stage= According to the labors of personnel supply services research conducted in 1996, almost 9 out of 10 laborers were hired by dispatched work agencies. In addition, according to the statistics of America Staffing Association, 90% of American enterprises used the services provided from labor dispatching industry. This illustrated how ingrained the concept of labor dispatching had become in American society. In Japan, since making the law of labor dispatching in 1985, labor dispatching developed rapidly, leading to the development of 615 general dispatched work agencies, 3,266 specific dispatched work agencies, and 1.4 billion dispatched laborers. As of 1998, there were 3026 general dispatched work agencies, 6985 specific dispatched work agencies, and 9 billion dispatched labors. In a short span of 12 years, the population of dispatched labor has grown six times, and it still kept increasing. Especially after the law of labor dispatching in Japan changed for the 4th time. In the 90s, EU labor dispatching was the fastest growing employment form in all of the atypical employment networks. Among most member states, the population of dispatched labor forces multiplied in growth. The ILO went on to approve the Convention Concerning Private Employment Agencies (NO. 181), which had two key corrections: First, corrected the Convention Concerning Fee-Charging Employment Agencies(NO. 96). The activities of private employment agencies were not confined to placement services and job placement anymore but the employer could provide laborers to third parties. Second, urged the international society members to attach importance on the flexibility of labor market. Because of the legislation of ILO Convention 181, it spurred big progress in the development of labor dispatching. Dispatched Labor by Country =Japan= Regularly EmployedÔºöDispatched work agencies send their regular employed workers to client enterprises to provide labor. The labor contracts between dispatched workers and dispatched work agencies are irregular labor contracts, thus, whether the period of dispatched contracts expire or not, it will not influence the labor relation between dispatched workers and dispatched work agencies. As long as the relationship between dispatched workers and dispatched work agencies exists, whether dispatched workers engage in dispatched jobs or not, dispatched work agencies still have to pay wages to dispatched workers. Registered: There is no irregular labor relationship between dispatched work agencies and dispatched workers. Dispatched workers merely go to dispatched work agencies to register. Only when client enterprises ask dispatched work agencies for human resources and the demand meets dispatched workers' conditions, do dispatched work agencies sign labor contracts with dispatched workers. The period of a labor contract is usually the same as with dispatched contracts, so when the dispatched contracts expire, the labor contracts do, too. Dispatched workers will go back to the status of registered. =Germany= (1) Non-profit labor dispatched: Employees works for their employers, but at some special situations, employers lend them to the third one. Employers need employees to work for them for a long term, and they don't use employers to get profit, so they only dispatch workers to other enterprises temporarily; therefore, this kind dispatched workers' wages are better than who are in dispatched work agencies. As a result, there is no any specific law to regulate non-profit labor dispatched. (2) Profit labor dispatched: This is the same as \\"regularly employed type\\" in Japan; however, there is no \\"register-type\\" in Germany. About profit labor dispatched, Germany passed and executed Arbeitnehmer√ºberlassungsgesetz in 1972, and it included detailed contents to regulate this kind of dispatched work. Development and Current Situation On 28 December 2012, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed an amendment to the Labour Contract Law. The changes will come into force on 1 July 2013 and mainly affect labour dispatch. The Amendment increases the registration requirements for labour dispatch agencies, improves how dispatched employees are remunerated, clarifies the scope of eligible positions and assigns liabilities to host employers. Labour dispatch is highly relied upon in China to staff companies, both domestic and foreigninvested. Under a typical labour dispatch arrangement, a dispatch agency enters into an employment contract with an employee and then enters into a dispatch agreement with a host employer, pursuant to which the employee is dispatched to the host employer. Under this scheme, the dispatch agency, instead of the host employer, assumes all obligations and liabilities of an employer, such as paying social security contributions and severance for the employees. There have been debates on the use of labour dispatch because it makes it easier for employers to evade liabilities, and thus dispatched employees often have less protection than regular employees. When promulgated in 2007, the Labour Contract Law compromised on this issue by intentionally leaving certain provisions ambiguous and general. As a result, the use of labour dispatch has continued to grow even after the law was introduced. The purpose of the Amendment is to tighten the rules on labour dispatch.

Detail from 1776 mural monument to Richard Stevens and his wife Elizabeth, St Peter's Church, Peters Marland Richard Stevens (1702‚Äì1776) of Winscott in the parish of Peters Marland, Devon, was Member of Parliament for Callington in Cornwall (1761‚Äì1768). Origins He was the second son of Richard Stevens (c. 1670 ‚Äì 1727) of Vielstone in the parish of Buckland Brewer, Devon, (son of Henry Stevens (1617-post 1675) of Vielstone by his wife Judith Hancock (1650‚Äì1676), daughter of John Hancock lord of the manor of Combe Martin.Per Judith's mural monument in Great Torrington Church) His elder brother was Henry Stevens (1689‚Äì1748) of Cross, Little Torrington and Smithacott in the parish of Frithelstock. =Ancestry= No entry for the Stevens family exists in the 1620 Heraldic Visitation of Devon, and thus the family's pedigree is not officially recorded, and the family must be assumed not to have been counted amongst the gentry of Devon at that time, or to have settled in the county after that date. The earliest record of the Stevens family in Devon is as follows: *William Stevens (died 1648) of Great Torrington. *Henry Stevens de Velstone, son and heir of William Stevens of Great Torrington. The earliest known seat of the Stevens family in Devon was Vielstone, in 2013 a farmhouse used as a care home, in the parish of Buckland Brewer about five miles south-west of Great Torrington.Vielstone: as is recorded on the ornate mural monument to Judith Stevens (died 1676), daughter of John Hancock of Combe Martin, and wife of Henry Stevens de Velstone, son and heir of William Stevens of Great Torrington, on the east wall of the south aisle of Great Torrington parish church He married Judith Stevens (died 1676), daughter of John Hancock lord of the manor of Combe Martin, as is recorded on the ornate mural monument to Judith Stevens (died 1676) on the east wall of the south aisle of Great Torrington parish church. One of their sons, John Stevens (died 1674) predeceased his father, as is revealed by his grave-slab under his father's mural monument in Great Torrington Church. Henry appears to have had two sisters, both listed passim in the Visitation of Devon as \\"daughter of William Stevens of Great Torrington\\": Susannah Stevens (died 1694/5), who married firstly Alexander Rolle (died 1660) of Tawstock, a younger son of a junior line of the Rolles of Stevenstone. She married secondly in 1664, as his third wife, Sir John Chichester (1598‚Äì1669) of Hall, in the parish of Bishops Tawton, and had issue from both marriages.Vivian, Visitation of Devon, 1895, p.653 (Rolle), p.177 (Chichester, with her father incorrectly given) Mary Stevens (died 1669), buried at St Giles in the Wood, married in 1639 Henry Rolle (1605‚Äì1647), of Beam near Great Torrington, who in 1642 inherited from his infant cousin Denys Rolle (1638‚Äì1642) the Stevenstone estates. The marriage was childless and his heir was his cousin Sir John Rolle (died 1706), KB.Vivian, Visitation of Devon, 1895, p.653 *Richard Stevens, son of Henry Stevens de Velstone. He married a certain Elizabeth, and had two sons: Henry Stevens (1689‚Äì1748) of Cross, in the parish of Little Torrington, described in his will as \\"of Smithcott\\" in the parish of Frithelstock, but who built the existing mansion of Cross between 1744 and 1748.Slate tablet erected by present owner of Cross, Mrs Rowena Cotton He married Christiana Maria Rolle (1710‚Äì1780), a daughter of John Rolle (1679‚Äì1730), MP, of Stevenstone, in the nearby parish of St Giles in the Wood, and sister of Henry Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (1708‚Äì1750). Portraits of Christiana and of her brothers John Rolle Walter (1712‚Äì1779), and Denys Rolle (1725‚Äì1797), successively owners of the Stevenstone estates, were painted by Thomas Hudson and were given in the early 1900s by Lord Clinton to the Great Torrington Town Lands and Poors Charity. They are on public display in Great Torrington townhall. The Rolles of Stevenstone were the largest landowners on Devon. Henry Stevens's heir was his son Henry Stevens (1739‚Äì1802), who married Sarah Bridget Marwood (who married secondly John Inglett Fortescue of Buckland Filleigh), but who died without children leaving as heir his sister Christiana Stevens (1743‚Äì1828) who had married in 1779 Rev. Thomas Moore (1740‚Äì1802), vicar of Bishops Tawton. Richard Stevens (1702‚Äì1776), MP, of Winscott, subject of the present article. Career He was the chief agent in charge of the estates centred on Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe belonging to the wealthy heiress Margaret Rolle, suo jure 15th Baroness Clinton (1709‚Äì1781). Her first husband was Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford eldest son of Robert Walpole the first Prime Minister.Leadam, Biography of Robert Walpole.Broome, p. 9. She lived briefly at the Walpole's palatial residence Houghton Hall in Norfolk, built by Robert Walpole in 1722,Broome, p. 7-8. but on the failure of her marriage she moved abroad to Italy. Thus she required a trustworthy agent in Devon to manage her affairs, which included estates in Devon and Cornwall. The Rolle family controlled one of the seats in the rotten borough of Callington in Cornwall, and at the 1761 general election Richard Stevens was returned on her interest as one of its members of Parliament.Drummond He held the seat until 1768. Marriage and children In 1724 at Frithelstock he married his cousin Elizabeth Stevens (1707‚Äì1768), only daughter and executrix of Hugh Stevens of Buckland Brewer, by whom he had children including: *Hugh Stevens (1724‚Äì1755), predeceased his father, aged 31 *Richard Stevens (1733‚Äì1762), predeceased his father, aged 29 *Henry Stevens ()1745‚Äì1764), predeceased his father, aged 19 *Elizabeth Stevens (1727‚Äì1792), who married twice, firstly to Robert Awse of Horwood House in the parish of Frithelstock, and secondly in 1782 to John Clevland (1734‚Äì1817), of Tapeley near Bideford, seven times MP for Barnstaple.

Many North African residents took a more negative view of France after the Rif War occurred.

The numbers of students had decreased from the period between the World Wars, and only a small number of the north Africans included intellectuals, doctors, and lawyers. Hussey stated that initially North Africans settled the same historic communities as they did before. Under French colonial rule, Algeria was a French \\"department\\", meaning that Algerian subjects were given significant rights of migration to the French mainland. After 1947 until Algerian Independence in 1962, all Algerians were French citizens with full rights of migration, similar to the situation of Puerto Ricans in the United States. Naomi Davidson, the author of Only Muslim: Embodying Islam in Twentieth- Century France, wrote that there was a post-World War II perception that North Africans were taking over certain neighborhoods but that this was not accurate. She stated that the police records of North African immigrants from 1948 to 1952, which had their basis in employment figures and ration cards, were \\"not entirely reliable\\", and that \\"it is difficult to establish with any certainty precisely where the different North African immigrant social classes lived in Paris and the suburbs, making it impossible to argue that certain neighborhoods became \\"Maghr√©bin\\" virtually overnight.\\" The police chief of Paris, Maurice Papon, enacted a repression policy against Algerians in Paris during the years 1958 through 1962.

John Butler Smith House, also now known as the Community Building, is a historic house at 29 School Street in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. The large Queen Anne Victorian is significant as one of few known residential works of a prolific New Hampshire architect, William M. Butterfield, and as the home of John Butler Smith, a principal owner of the local Contoocook Mills, who also served as governor of New Hampshire (1893-95). The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Governor John Butler Smith House is located in the village center of Hillsborough, on the east side of School Street north of Myrtle Street. It is a rambling Victorian -story wood frame structure, clad in brick with granite trim on the ground floor, and wooden clapboards and shingles on the upper levels. Dominant features include a circular turret with pyramidal roof at the right front corner, a large projecting gable on the left side, and a single- story porch across much of the front, supported by clustered columns. The interior, like the exterior, is lavishly appointed with woodwork. The property also includes a carriage house built in 1892. This house began as a two-story Italianate structure built in 1866, which was extended with a mansard roof in 1885. Smith hired Butterfield to make major modifications in 1892, rotating the 1866 house and moving it back on the lot, and then adding the front section of the house, more than doubling its size. Smith's heirs donated the building to the town of Hillsborough, which has converted into town offices, library, and a community meeting space.

The book was published in 2009 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Overview The book examines the history of economic theory and attempts to diagnose the recent rise and fall of markets, particularly the housing bubble and credit crisis (2007‚Äì2009). How Markets Fail argues against unfettered free-market ideology and supports government regulation in the financial industry.http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_47/b4156079791251.htm Reception Kirkus, giving it a starred review, remarked, \\"Cassidy delivers on the promise of his title, but he also offers a clear-eyed look at economic thinking over the last three centuries, from Adam Smith to Ben Bernanke, and shows how the major theories have played out in practice, often not well.\\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-cassidy/how-markets- fail/ Robert M. Solow of The New Republic said Cassidy lays out well how a competitive market economy in equilibrium will achieve efficient resource allocation. He said that How Markets Fail \\"should confer on a thoughtful reader a lasting immunity to erroneous free-market sloganeering, whether simpleminded or devious, while still conveying some feeling for what a well- functioning market system can actually do. Both ideas are important.\\" Robert Pollin of Monthly Review described How Markets Fail as \\"a work of considerable scope, offering fresh perspectives on a wide range of topics\\". He said the first two sections summarizing freshwater and saltwater economics \\"are not dry and intimidating [...] Cassidy‚Äôs writing in these chapters is clear and lively.\\" Pollin also credited Cassidy as \\"the first widely read commentator to give the great financial macroeconomist Hyman Minsky and [...] Monthly Review founding coeditor Paul Sweezy their due, as two of a tiny handful of people who recognized and warned about the patterns\\". However, Pollin also says the journalist \\"never focuses seriously on how we might translate the insights of reality-based economics into a workable set of policies and institutions\\". Bob Frick recommended it as the best book about the causes of the Great Recession and referred to it as \\"a damning story of how economics drives government policies that promote bubbles [...] You should read this excellent book\\". Ivan Fallon of The Independent stated, \\"He writes more as the economic historian which he is at heart than as the journalist he is in practice, with a cool and authoritative perception of the key elements which caused the huge boom and the even bigger bust of the past decade.\\" The Globe and Mail's Janice Gross Stein wrote, \\"What John Cassidy teaches us in his fluent and lucid narrative of how markets fail is that there is no silver bullet, no single coherent set of ideas that can 'fix' the global economy. [...] Markets have always needed regulation and societies have always needed dynamic, innovative markets.\\" Richard N. Cooper of Foreign Affairs praised it as \\"highly readable [...] a clear and occasionally colorful exposition of the evolution of relevant economic thought in a way that is accessible to non-economists.\\" The Economist praised the book, noting that its critique of \\"free market idolatry\\" was, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, \\"firmly in the mainstream\\".https://www.economist.com/node/14843529 The Daily Telegraph's Jeff Randall called it \\"excellent\\", saying Cassidy \\"is blessed with a rare combination of writing skills and intellectual hinterland, and has produced a fresh and engaging explanation of the calamity [...] His book combines thorough research with scholarly insights and the classy prose that has become his hallmark\\". Randall said that the author's explanation for how markets fail is as follows: \\"Presented with what looks like money for nothing, the crowd goes mad.\\" The Financial Times review by Gillian Tett likewise praised the book as \\"compelling and persuasive\\", praising the book's criticism of government's excessive trust in free market principles, and its account of how the \\"modern economics profession\\" had \\"lost its way\\".https://www.ft.com/content/60326096-e065-11de-8494-00144feab49a Peter Clarke of New Statesman called it \\"engaging\\" and wrote that \\"Cassidy is able to lead us with beguiling lucidity through unfamiliar territory.\\" He argued that the book \\"does not claim to have all the answers, but it deftly illuminates some crucial problems in the light of our recent experiences.\\" Paul M. Barrett of The New York Times, in a review of both How Markets Fail and Andrew Ross Sorkin's Too Big to Fail, said that the former \\"offers a brilliant intellectual framework\\" for Sorkin's narrative. Robert P. Murphy criticized statements Cassidy made against free-market economics in an NPR interview promoting the book, arguing that Cassidy \\"caricatures the case for free markets\\" and that the \\"proper way to avoid bankrupting the taxpayers is to stop bailing out big banks.\\" References External linksDiscussion on How Markets Fail with John Cassidy, December 4, 2009 Books about economic crises 2009 non-fiction books Books about philosophy of economics ","title":"How Markets Fail"},{"id":"42953988","text":"Chionothremma soligena is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

The case is widely believed to have been an encounter killing by the Gujarat Police. DIG D.G. Vanzara has been in jail for seven years, on charges of having organised this encounter, among others. On 8 April 2011, the Supreme Court of India directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take up the investigation. Amit Shah arrest in the case The case came into prominence in 2012, when the CBI, in its chargesheet, listed Gujarat home minister and leading BJP politician Amit Shah as the \\"kingpin and prime accused\\" in the case. Amit Shah was arrested in October 2012. Earlier, an unprecedented total of 32 police officers, including six IPS officers including Vanzara, had been arrested for the series of \\"encounter deaths\\". According to the CBI, Prajapati was a witness to the encounter death of Sohrabuddin Shaikh in 2005, and this was why he had to be eliminated.http://www.tehelka.com/story_main30.asp?filename=Ne120507Death_by_CS.asp&id;=2 The encounter killing took place in Banaskantha district. Just 13 days earlier, Vanzara, known to be close to Amit Shah and Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister of Gujarat at the time, was surprisingly transferred there as DIG Border range. Shah claimed that the transfer was an administrative move, not connected to the encounter. Possible involvement in Haren Pandya assassination In September 2013, after six years in prison, Vanzara who called Modi \\"my God\\", became disgruntled, and apparently claimed a connection between the Tulsiram Prajapati and the unsolved murder of ex-BJP minister Haren Pandya, who was at one time a minister under Narendra Modi. Pandya was shot dead while out on a morning walk in March 2003, a year after his fallout with Modi. In 2003, it was Vanzara who had originally investigated the Pandya murder. Similar claims have also been made by the DNA newspaper, which has suggested that Sheikh was eliminated because of his links to the political murder of Pandya. CBI Reconstruct Tulsi Prajapati encounter case The CBI and a team of forensic science experts reconstructed the alleged fake encounter of Tulsi Prajapati by Gujarat police in 2006 at Chhapri village in the district on July 8, 2011. The team headed by Rajendra Singh of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), and T D Dogra of Forensic Medicine Department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), began the reconstruction early morning. The forensic experts and CBI were assisted by state CID officials. CID was investigating the case before the Supreme Court transferred it to the central agency. The experts obtained crucial data such as the distance between the police vehicle and the car in which Prajapati was travelling, location of Prajapati‚Äôs body after the encounter as per the CID‚Äôs FIR, how police officers fired at Prajapati and the distance from which they fired.

Teso College is an all-male preparatory school, a boarding school, located in Aloet, Soroti, in Uganda. As of 2014, Teso College has 1,574 students. Over 30,000 students have graduated from TCA since its establishment. Teso College ranks in the top 50 in the Ugandan national examinations performance listing. Students at Teso College have access to a full array of co-curricular activities, including clubs and sports. Teso College's mission is to educate the future leaders of Uganda.  History  Teso College was started in 1953 through the initiative of the local people from the Aloet area, with the support of Leo Okol, the Chairman of the Teso District Council at the time. The school didn't have a name at first, and consisted of only two junior classes. By 1954, under the leadership of the Teso District Local Administration, Teso College had grown into the one of the largest and best equipped schools in Teso and Uganda. On 9 July 1954, the foundation stone for the new school was laid by then colonial Governor of Uganda, Sir Andrew Cohen, marking the official founding of the school and giving it the name Teso College Aloet. The preparations for enrolment and the formal start of teaching at Teso College were begun by A.S Baxendale, who was to later become Principal Education Officer, Eastern Province. In February 1955, John Sassoon, first acting Headmaster of the school, completed these preparations. Classes officially started on 1 March 1955, with James Opolot as the Assistant Master. On 2 March 1955, the Principal Judge of Teso District, E.P. Engulu, and the Secretary General of Teso, J.E.I. Ogaino, attended the first assembly held in Teso College, where Engulu presented the school with the gift of a drum. Towards the end of 1955, the first headmaster of the college Aloet, Jonny E. Jones, arrived from Sudan. From its foundation until 2012, 14 headmasters have led the college. Teso College has taught the Christian religion from the beginning, and provides religious facilities to the students. Prior to the construction of the Anglican and Catholic chapels, the room next to the library was furnished as a chapel, and the Anglican Church of Uganda held Bible fellowships there. The art room was designated as the Catholic chapel, with services by a chaplain. The school suffered some severe setbacks from 1986‚Äì2002, with the revolutions and unsettled political climate of Teso. The situation has steadily improved from 2005 onwards, with Teso College's performance in the Ugandan National Examinations getting better and better.  Campus  Teso College is composed of two wings, the east wing and the west wing. Each wing contains classrooms, dormitories, and other necessary infrastructure. The main administrative offices are located in the east wing. This building houses offices for the Head Teacher, the Head Teacher's secretary, the deputy head teachers, and the school bursar. It also includes a small chapel and the staff room. The Assembly Hall is adjacent to the administrative building. It serves multiple purposes, including Saturday morning assemblies, special conferences, meetings and debates. It is also used for entertainment purposes, such as film screenings. The Assembly Hall is also used for the purposes of holding National Exams at the end of the year. The college has eight dormitories for Ordinary Level students (five in the east wing and three in the west wing); and one dormitory and two halls of residence for Advanced Level students. Each dormitory in the east wing has a sister dormitory with the same name in the west wing. The dormitories were named after influential personalities in the administration of Teso at the time, and other key African figures. They include the following: * Kenyatta House: Named in honour of Jomo Kenyatta, originally born Kamau Wa Ngengi, the first President of the Republic of Kenya. * Lumumba House: Named after Patrice √âmery Lumumba. Lumumba was a Congolese independence leader and the first legally elected Prime Minister of the Republic of Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo) after he helped win its independence from Belgium in June 1960. * Obwangor House: Named in honour of the then political boss of First Teso District, Cuthbert Joseph Obwangor, for his immense contribution to the development of Teso. Obwangor was the first Etesot to represent Teso district in Uganda's parliament. Obwangor House has a capacity of 128 students, and is closest to the dining hall. It has generally performed the best in sports and during inspections. * Akabway House: Named for Akabway Stephen, who started out a Sub-County Chief and retired as County Chief of Katakwi County (present- day Katakwi district). * Engulu House: Named after Engulu Eria Paulo, the first Principal Judge of Teso District, who also officiated in the first Assembly of Teso College Aloet. * Engwau House: Named after Justice Engwau, who studied in Teso College between 1957 and 1960. Engwau had a First Class Law diploma from Nsamizi Law School. Upon completing his studies, he first worked as a teacher in Iganga C.O.U, then worked in Lira district. He joined the Judiciary as a Grade III Magistrate in 1964. * Epaku House: Named for Epaku, who donated the land upon which the school is constructed. * Esabu House: Named in memory of a County Chief in Teso district, Esabu Patrick, who was later elevated to the position of District Commissioner, Mubende district. There is one dormitory and two halls of residence for ‚ÄòA‚Äô Level students. These include Akabway House, Jones Hall and Inyoin Hall. The two adjoining halls are separated by a common area. * Jones Hall: Named after the pioneer Headmaster of the school. * Inyoin Hall: Named for Inyoin J. Onaba Kamodan, popularly known as J.O.K., who rose from being a classroom teacher of Ngora High School to become the first Treasurer of the Teso District Council. J.O.K was a man of transparent honesty, and advocated a corruption-free Teso district. This hall accommodates 120 ‚ÄòA‚Äô Level students. * Akabway House: Named for Akabway Stephen, who began his career as a Sub-county Chief and retired as County Chief of Katakwi County (present-day Katakwi district).  Religious Life in Teso College  Teso College Aloet allows freedom of worship. The school has two churches‚Äîthe Church of Uganda, located in the west wing, and the Catholic Church, located in the east wing.  Teso College Farm  The school farm is engaged in the production of crops and livestock, as well as apiculture. The main objectives of the school farm are to provide practical training to students studying agriculture, to train the other students in farming skills, to produce food crops and animal products to supplement the students‚Äô diet, to help the students understand the importance of agriculture, and to prepare the students to be self-reliant after leaving school. The school farm raises and cares for chickens, cows, pigs, an orchard with over 300 orange trees covering 3 acres of land, approximately 12,000 pine trees which occupy about 12 acres of land, and 5 large Kenya Top Bar hives with bees.  Teso College Staff  The college employs around 70 teachers and specialists who oversee the academic programs and 17 co-curricular clubs and activities. The students' examination results are amongst the best in Uganda, and the college has a reputation for academic excellence in the north-eastern region. Approximately 25 non-teaching staff provide specialist assistance, working alongside teachers.  Departments  English Department: English Language and Literature in English The English language is the only language taught at TCA. As the school's only official language, as well as its language of instruction, English plays a pivotal role in learning other subjects in the curriculum. Literature in English is taught alongside the English language from Senior One. Studying literature in English helps to improve the student's performance in the language because it exposes him to appropriate language in different contexts and to a number of language resources and ingredients. Mathematics Department Every year 60 students participate in the National Mathematics contest organized by the Uganda Mathematical Society. A good number of them feature in the top positions nationwide. Teamwork is exhibited among the members of the department and this has resulted in continued improvement in the performance of students both at ‚ÄòO‚Äô and ‚ÄòA‚Äô Levels. Physics Department The Physics Department is run by all the teachers in the department, spearheaded by the Head of Department The formation of Physics Club that has helped to boost academic performance, leading to continued improvement of results at UCE and UACE UNEB Examinations. Agriculture Department The school farm has greatly been improved, both for commercial and teaching purposes. There are poultry and piggery components in the farm. It used to have local cattle, but those have been sold and replaced with exotic breeds. Performance in Agriculture at National examinations has kept improving over the past years. Commerce Department Commerce is one of the business subjects taught in the college. It was formerly taught for three years starting with Senior Two, but currently it is taught for four years starting with Senior One. Commerce is taught by permanent teachers and others who are on the government payroll. The department's performance has improved over the past years. Christian Religious Education Department The subject is offered at both ‚ÄòO‚Äô and ‚ÄòA‚Äô Levels. It is one of the optional subjects taken by a majority of students at ‚ÄòO‚Äô Level, with 75% of the semi- and candidate classes doing it. It is one of the most popular subjects at the ‚ÄòA‚Äô Level Arts department. The performance has been good for the last ten years, with a majority of students scoring distinctions and credits at ‚ÄòO‚Äô Level and principal passes at ‚ÄòA‚Äô Level. Biology Department Biology is one of the compulsory science subjects. Technical Drawing Department This department can be described as going from inconspicuous to prominent during its recent history, from 4 students in 2006 to an average of 60 students presently enrolled,. With the decision to eliminate woodwork as a subject in 2007, Technical Drawing has remained the flagship subject for the department. History Department History is one of the 7 core subjects taught at ‚ÄòO‚Äô Level, and it is a popular arts subject at ‚ÄòA‚Äô Level. Geography Department Geography is a compulsory subject at ‚ÄòO‚Äô Level and optional at ‚ÄòA‚Äô Level. Fine Art Department The Department of Fine Art is unique in the region because the students are exposed to various materials and tools which are purchased by the school every term. The students are taught how to draw using different media, such as poster paint, watercolours and powders. Entrepreneurship Education Department Entrepreneurship Education is a new innovation in educational reform instituted by the Ministry of Education and Sports. It is aimed at creating job makers rather than the job seekers that have been prevalent up until now. The objective is to instil business skills among the students. As a department, we impart business skills, so that by the end of their formal education, students should be able to start their own income-generating businesses, and eventually sustain and maintain them. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Department This department was originally set up as a project under the PTA. ICT went on to become one of the subjects in the school. Gradually more students grew interested in the subject, and it was decided that those interested should get registered for the Uganda National Examinations (UNEB). The department has become so busy that the entire students‚Äô population is now being taught ICT skills. Chemistry Department Chemistry is one of the subjects offered from S.1 ‚Äì S.6 in Teso College Aloet and in many other schools in the country. Physical Education Department This subject was introduced to the college and the whole country in 2010.

History The construction of the first church on the site is traditionally attributed to Landulfo, Bishop of Capua, in 856, using spolia columns from the local amphitheater or other churches, but it was rebuilt in the 10th century and again, under Archbishop Erveo, towards the end of the 11th century, with subsequent major works. The bell-tower has Lombard and Norman influences. The entire church was destroyed by bombardment on 9 September 1943. It was rebuilt between 1949 and 1957. The Diocesan Museum was installed in a chapel here in 1992. Works of art Among the paintings in the church are works by Domenico Vaccaro. Some of the frescoes recall past works including the frescoes in the presbytery depicting Eucharistic scenes (1961). The main altarpiece is of the Assumption of the Virgin by Francesco Solimena. In the nave are the columns by Archbishop Erveo (1073-1088) and a font from archbishop Cesare Costa (1572-1602).

A Drop of Milk) is a foundation started by Trinidad Rizal (sister of Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jos√© Rizal) and Concepci√≥n Felix on 1906 that primarily aims to provide nutritional and medical needs of indigent Filipino mothers and their children. Founded by La Protecci√≥n de la Infancia Inc., the foundation continues to deliver daily milk rations to Filipino infants Its headquarters, the Gota de Leche building located at 859 S. Loyota St., Sampaloc, Manila, Philippines, designed by architects Juan Arellano and Arcadio Arellano (founding father of Philippine architecture), was awarded Honourable Mention by the UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2003. This opened further support from the National Commission on Culture and the Arts. The Gota de Leche Building was declared by the National Museum of the Philippines as an Important Cultural Property in August 2014.  History  The Gota de Leche Building 300x200px Beriberi, a sickness caused by a nutritional deficit in Vitamin B1 or Thiamine, was discovered among Filipino women after the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War in 1902. Hundreds of infants died before ever reaching 3 months old and it was found that the milk coming from affected mothers were causing these deaths. This distressing condition moved a group of women to address the situation. And so in 1905, Asosaci√≥n Feminista Filipina was born. It was led by Trinidad Rizal and Concepcion Felix, together with other educated women of the time. Gota de Leche was established the year after, in 1906, as station that manages the daily distribution of pasteurized cow‚Äôs milk to Filipino infants. They also provide nutrition education programs to Filipino mothers. This project was recognized as heroic and in order for it to further succeed, the founders needed to collaborate with other professionals who were willing to lend a helping hand to the cause. The collaboration subsequently led to the formation of La Protecci√≥n de la Infacia Inc., the Philippines‚Äô first independent charity organization constituted by doctors and business leaders among others. La Protecci√≥n de la Infancia Inc. opened Gota de Leche, the brainchild of Dr. Calderon, who was inspired after witnessing the noble act of the organization. Initially headquartered on Calle San Pedro (now Evangelista Street) in Santa Cruz near Plaza Miranda, the society moved to its present location in Sampaloc upon the completion of the Gota de Leche Building in 1917. Gota de Leche continues its charitable activities. It still provides nutritional and medical assistance to qualified Filipino mothers and children while closely monitoring their improvement. This landmark building also houses the first national center for women‚Äôs rights that provides counselling services. Other services include dental assistance, educating families on common illnesses, and playing educational games with the children. Gota de Leche has also started their Brown Rice program, for impoverished families ensuring access to complementary food rations for both mother and child. Volunteers come and provide information on diet and keeping healthy to their parents. In the wake of the recent disaster caused by Typhoon Yolanda, the institution has also opened its doors, literally, to those displaced by the typhoon. The careful restoration of Gota de Leche established the importance of heritage structures and the value of historical buildings as an alternative to demolition.

He served as Curate of Westbury, Shropshire in 1850, Curate of the Church of St John of Beverley, Whatton in 1851‚Äì1864, and Curate of Sibthorpe in 1855‚Äì1864. He then became Vicar of St. Peter's Church, Farndon in Nottinghamshire in 1864 and remained the incumbent there until his death in 1894. At the time of Maltby's arrival the combined parishes of Farndon and Balderton had just been redivided. He was dismayed by the condition of the church, which the Southwell Diocesan Magazine described as in a \\"melancholy condition of squalor and decay\\". The neglected Prebendary house was too small for his family, but a more spacious one was found at the corner of Main Street and Marsh Lane. He soon set about improving the church, largely at his own expense. A contractor's account dated 1866 refers to the addition of a \\"becoming altar with fittings, an organ and stalls\\" at a cost of ¬£300. The area beneath the tower was fitted as a temporary vestry. Further restoration and expansion ensued in the early 1890s.Southwell & Nottingham Church History Project: Farndon St Peter Retrieved 5 October 2017.

Based on the song \\"Lea Halalela (Holy Land)\\", a track featured on Lebo's Lion King-inspired concept album Rhythm of the Pride Lands (1995), Lebo composed the track with Zimmer, while both Lebo and Mancina contributed new lyrics to its melody. Lebo based the song's lyrics on his own experiences having been exiled from South Africa during apartheid, therefore imbuing \\"Shadowland\\" with themes about refugeeism and survival. Originally performed by Trinidadian-American singer and actress Heather Headley as Nala, and South African actress Tsidii Le Loka as Rafiki, roles both performers originated on stage, \\"Shadowland\\" narrates Nala's decision to leave the Pride Lands in search of a more habitable environment upon realizing that her homeland has grown dry and barren in the midst of Scar's reign. Taking place shortly after Nala rejects Scar's romantic advances, director Julie Taymor used the song to develop Nala into a stronger character for the stage adaptation, and identified \\"Shadowland\\" as her favorite among the production's original songs, believing its message and themes to be universal. Musically, \\"Shadowland\\" is a soul power ballad. Sung in both English and African languages, its instrumentation combines African percussion with European orchestration to create a more exotic sound while accompanying pop vocals and African chants; some critics have observed political themes such as feminism, injustice and the ecosystem throughout the song's lyrics. \\"Shadowland\\" has been mostly positively received by music and theatre critics; both Headley and actresses who replaced her in subsequent productions of the musical have been praised for their vocals and performances.  Background  alt=Caucasian woman with long, straight black hair dressed in black and white business attire.Disney decided that the five pop-oriented songs composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice had written for the animated film would be augmented by more exotic-sounding, percussive and African-influenced musical numbers for its stage adaptation. \\"Shadowland\\" was written by songwriters Lebo M., Hans Zimmer, and Mark Mancina, with Lebo and Zimmer composing its music, while both Lebo and Mancina wrote the song's lyrics. \\"Shadowland\\" is based on \\"Lea Halalela (Holy Land)\\", a song Zimmer and Lebo had originally written for the film that debuted on the Lion King-inspired concept album Rhythm of the Pride Lands (1995). The track itself is inspired by an orchestral theme used in the film. Based on both an excerpt from Zimmer's film score and \\"Lea Halalela (Holy Land)\\", \\"Shadowland\\" was the fifth of the musical's original songs to be directly adapted from a Rhythm of the Pride Lands track. Meanwhile, Lebo and Mancina contributed new lyrics to the song's pre-existing music, with Lebo basing his lyrics on his own experience being exiled from South Africa during apartheid. Mancina arranged and produced the track himself. In the animated film, Nala contributes to two duets: \\"I Just Can't Wait to be King\\" and \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\". Director Julie Taymor consistently found herself drawn to the South African musical influences Lebo introduced to the production during rehearsals. Acknowledging the film's lack of prominent female roles, the director was interested in expanding Nala's role into that of a more complex, three dimensional female character for the musical and believed \\"Shadowland\\" would help develop her into a stronger heroine. Will Albrittonat of the University of South Florida's The Oracle agreed that the song strengthens Nala's character, allowing her a greater significant role. Taymor explained, \\"When you talk about lions, the females do all of it ... So I threw out a lot of the soft stuff in the film and made Nala very strong\\", giving the character \\"one of the best songs in the show, 'Shadowland,' which is about being a refugee,\\" a subject the director believes remains \\"very topical\\". Furthermore, Taymor cited the song as a \\"perfect\\" example of music that \\"has a narrative force of its own\\", via which \\"Nala's feelings are transmitted\\". Calling the ballad \\"extraordinary\\", Taymor identified \\"Shadowland\\" as one of her favorite songs in the musical, second to \\"Circle of Life\\", and continues to get emotional when she hears it. In addition to originating the role of Nala, Trinidadian-American singer and actress Heather Headley recorded \\"Shadowland\\" for The Lion King: Original Broadway Cast Recording.  Context and use in The Lion King  \\"Shadowland\\" is performed by Nala before she leaves the Pride Lands in search of a better home one she decides she can no longer tolerate her current circumstances living under Scar's treacherous rule. Set during the musical's second act, the song occurs shortly after \\"The Madness of King Scar\\", in which Nala rebukes Scar's lecherous attempts to make her his queen. Nala is forced to choose between survival or remaining with her pride. Seeking permission from her pride before she leaves in search of a fertile land to where they can relocate, Nala bids an emotional farewell to her fellow lionesses and homeland, which has grown dry and barren due to famine and drought under Scar's reign. Performed against a background of \\"jungle fauna\\", the lionesses join Nala in chanting while mourning the barren state of what was once their ancestors' home, voicing their dissatisfaction with the condition of its ecosystem. Ultimately, Nala promises to eventually return with hope, and \\"always remember [her] pride\\". Rafiki also bestows her personal, sacred blessings upon the young lioness. Featuring exclusively females, the sequence features feline-influenced movements and choreography. According to Sarah O'Hara of Lowdown Magazine, the performance \\"demonstrate[s] all the desperation the lionesses faced in the hunt for food\\", continuing, \\"I could really feel Nala‚Äôs sadness and determination to better their situation.\\" John Moore of The Denver Post believes that by preceding ‚ÄúEndless Night\\" and \\"He Lives in You\\", \\"Shadowland\\" initiates a \\"climax\\" that \\"becomes a wildebeest stampede of ongoing powerful moments.\\" Everett Evans, writing for the Houston Chronicle, agreed that the song is one of the show's ballads that supply the musical with \\"emotional clout\\". Actress Kissy Simmons described the musical number as the sequence in which \\"her character has to do something to help her pride of lionesses.\\" Simmons believes that, at this point in the musical, it is likely that most of the lionesses have already been raped or sexually harassed by Scar by the time she realizes how dangerous the Pride Lands have become, forcing her to leave in search of hope and help. Depicting Nala's \\"fierce drive\\", the ballad further demonstrates the heroine's loyalty, beauty and strength. Nala experiences several different emotions during the song, beginning reserved as she observes how barren her homeland has become, a feeling that transitions into sadness and vulnerability before she accepts that she must ultimately \\"fight for this land, and get things to where they used to be‚Äù, according to actress Noxolo Dlamini. Miyako Singer of The Daily Californian wrote that, in addition to providing Nala with \\"her big solo moment\\", the song \\"showcases ... Nala‚Äôs strength and determination\\" as she ventures away from the Pride Lands in search of help. Due to the musical sequence featuring lionesses fighting back against \\"a male-dominated regime\\", the Houston Chronicle's Wei-Huan Chen likened the song to a women's march, comparing its use of black feminism to the music video for singer Beyonce's \\"Formation\\" (2016). Furthermore, Chen said that Nala sings the song in response to \\"Scar, threatening Nala that she, as his property, will bear his children without her consent.\\" Citing \\"Shadowland\\" as her favorite moment in the musical, ensemble singer Lindiwe Dlamini, who had sung the song for over 8,000 performances by 2017, agreed that \\"There‚Äôs something about the strength of a woman in that moment.\\" Ensemble actress Pia Hamilton agreed with Taymor's conscious decision to make certain scenes, such as \\"Shadowland\\", particularly \\"female heavy\\", believing that the song is used to depict \\"women in power.\\" Kieran Jonson of WhatsOnStage.com wrote that \\"Shadowland\\" offers Nala a moment to \\"shine\\".  Music and lyrics  Performed slowly, emotionally and dramatically, \\"Shadowland\\" is written in the key of A minor (with an introduction in C major) at a tempo of 70 beats per minute, and lasts four minutes and thirty seconds in duration. The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak described \\"Shadowland\\" as a \\"hauntingly beautiful ballad\\", while I. Herbert, author of Theatre Record, called it \\"hauntingly expressive\\". Several critics and media publications have acknowledged the song's \\"haunting\\" nature and sentiment. Musically, the ballad begins sad in tone before growing more determined and hopeful as it progresses. The song combines Zimmer's original melody with both English and African phrases that result in \\"a beguiling tribal flavor.\\" Seth Kubersky of Orlando Weekly identified \\"Shadowland\\" as one of the musical's original songs lifted from the film's score. Theatre Histories: An Introduction author Phillip B. Zarrilli agreed that \\"Shadowland\\" fuses \\"African and European rhythms and orchestration\\". According to the book The Oxford Handbook of The American Musical, \\"Shadowland\\"'s prominent use of African sounds is a strong example of \\"Non-Western musical styles hav[ing] made occasional appearances in the theater\\". Due to its African and South African influences, WhatsOnStage.com's Richard Forrest cited the composition as one of the few songs written specifically for the musical that \\"express most fully the show‚Äôs African roots\\", featuring African percussion and \\"soul- searching lyrics\\". Martin Brady, writing for the Nashville Scene, observed that African folk rhythms, melodies and choral harmonies are particularly \\"omnipresent\\" throughout \\"Shadowland\\". Lowdown Magazine's Sarah O'Hara described \\"Shadowland\\" as a soul song performed \\"with power ballad emotion\\". The song also incorporates pop rock influences. Instrumentally, \\"Shadowland\\" makes use of synthesizer strings. NewsOK's Brandy McDonnell described the ballad as an \\"understated ode\\". Described by Thesauro Cultural of The Cult as an \\"evocative ballad\\", the song begins with an African-language chant reading \\"Fatshe leso lea halalela\\". Lyrically, the song is about \\"losing [one's] home and finding solace elsewhere\\", according to Taymor, and alludes to themes about surviving as a refugee. Writing for the Houston Chronicle, Wei-Huan Chen agreed that \\"Shadowland\\" explores several political themes and subtexts that include feminism, believing its title is \\"applicable to any period in history shrouded by injustice\\". Taymor agreed that, in addition to being \\"reminiscent of Africa\\", the ballad boasts several additional interpretations that can be understood by virtually any culture \\"without understanding what is being said.\\" Janice M. Nargi, writing for JMN Publications, agreed that the song \\"fuse[s] contemporary messages of courage and empowerment with insistent cadences that suggest universality and timelessness.\\" The song also features an ecology-themed message, demonstrated by its lyric \\"‚ÄúThe river's dry, the ground has broken.\\" Michael Billington, arts critic for The Guardian, believes the song's use of grassland chants \\"pays homage to Africa\\". Billboard music critic Larry Flick wrote that Headley and actress Tsidii Le Loka exchange \\"smooth pop vocals and traditional tribal chants\\"; the soloists are augmented by a choir who \\"gradually builds the song to anthemic proportions\\". Describing Headley's vocals as \\"sung achingly\\", The New York Times Stephen Holden recognized \\"Shadowland\\" among the musical's three original ballads that serve as \\"potent vocal showcases\\" while contributing \\"genuine emotional depth\\" to the production, alongside \\"They Live in You\\" and \\"Endless Night\\". Headley's vocal range on the song spans approximately two octaves, from E3 to A5. Vocally, the ballad is believed to be best-suited for a mezzo-soprano/belter vocalist, according to the book Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology - Volume 4: Mezzo-Soprano/Belter. Critical reception To promote the musical, Headley performed \\"Shadowland\\" with Le Loka live on the Late Show with David Letterman in 1997, which Headley believes showcased her voice greatly. Critical reception towards \\"Shadowland\\" has been positive, with Headley consistently earning praise for her live rendition during her tenure as Nala. In August 1997, Chris Hewit of the St. Paul Pioneer Press commended Headley's \\"passionate\\" interpretation, while Playbills Robert Simonson observed that the singer's performance \\"draws applause every night\\". Richard Forrest of WhatsOnStage.com ranked \\"Shadowland\\" among the musical's standout numbers. Varietys Matt Wolf wrote that the ballad \\"stops the second act.\\" Lisa Martland, writing for The Stage, described the song as a highlight that provides \\"a poignancy lacking in other important scenes\\". Michael Portantiere, author of The Theatermania Guide to Musical Theater Recordings, ranked \\"Shadowland\\" among the best new additions to the show's score. Rex Smith, writing for Newsweek, called the song \\"beautiful\\", while Mark Collins of the Reporter-Herald described it as \\"show stopping and mournful\\". Describing \\"Shadowland\\" as a \\"glorious ballad\\", Billboard's Larry Flick opined that both pop and R&B; radio stations should be receptive towards the track. Carrie Ruth Moore of the Daily Trojan believes ‚ÄúShadowland\\" is one of the main reasons the original cast album won a Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album in 1999.Actress Kissy Simmons (pictured) has become closely associated with the song after Headley's departure; both renditions have been praised.Since Headley's departure, actresses who have replaced her in subsequent productions have continued to earn positive reviews for their renditions. When actress Kissy Simmons auditioned for the role in 2002, she auditioned for Taymor using \\"Shadowland\\"; Taymor enjoyed her rendition to the point of which she remarked \\"where have you been all of these years?\\" Jay Handelman, contributing to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, wrote that Simmons \\"shines during 'Shadowland'.\\" Laura Sternberg of About.com's Detroit Travel Guide praised Syndee Winters' performance at the Detroit Opera House, calling both her voice and the song \\"memorable\\". Praising actress Ta'Rea Campbell's performance at the Bass Concert Hall in 2007, Robert Faires of The Austin Chronicle wrote that she \\"fills 'Shadowland' with such urgency as to make it a potent dramatic statement as well as a lovely ballad.\\" Describing \\"Shadowland\\" as both \\"inspiring\\" and \\"lovely\\", The San Diego Union-Tribune critic Pam Kragen wrote that actress Marja Harmon sung the song \\"with great beauty\\". Actress Nia Holloway has also garnered strong reviews for her interpretation, whose performance Shannon McLoud of Motif Magazine deemed worth \\"The price of admission\\". The Daily Californian's Miyako Singer commended Holloway's rendition of \\"Shadowland\\" for \\"showcas[ing] her incredible vocal chops\\", while the Toronto Star's Kelly Cameron called the actress' vocals \\"stunning\\". Recognizing Holloway's performance as a standout, the News and Tribune contributor Claire White wrote that the actress' \\"combination of vocals and movement gave a great display of emotion to the audience.\\" Describing the song itself as \\"beautifully understated\\", Brandy McDonnell of NewsOK wrote that Holloway \\"provided the night's musical highlight\\" in review of a performance at the Civic Center Music Hall. The Capital Times' Lindsay Christians agreed that the actress sings the musical number \\"well\\". K103-FM called the ballad a second act showstopper, writing, \\"You really feel [Holloway's] presence on the stage\\" throughout the song. In a less positive review, Susan Haubenstock of the Richmond Times-Dispatch dismissed \\"Shadowland\\" as one of the new songs that resemble \\"filler\\", accusing it of slowing down the pace of the production and causing \\"the action and the energy peter out in the second act.\\" Similarly, Erin Gleeson of the Baltimore City Paper felt \\"Shadowland\\" was \\"unmemorable\\", writing that it \\"drag[s] down an otherwise lively and spirited production.\\" Alan Morrison of the Herald Scotland found the song's use of synthesizers dated.  Impact  \\"Shadowland\\" is still considered to be one of Headley's signature songs. In October 2014, Disney Theatrical Group released an official lyric video for the song and uploaded it to YouTube. Emily Brandon of Oh My Disney remarked that the song \\"is one of those songs that sticks with us long after we hear it\\" due to a combination of its moving lyrics, references to the film's score and appreciation for Nala's and her story\\". Actor Michael Crawford covered the song in a medley of songs from The Lion King. In 2016, Simmons performed the song live on the Disney Wonder cruise ship as part of the Disney Theatrical Group's \\"Stars Set Sail\\" live concert series. After Disney announced that singer Beyonc√© had been cast as Nala in John Favreau's upcoming CGI remake of The Lion King in November 2017, fans started hoping Beyonc√© would be recording a version of \\"Shadowland\\" for the film. WLCK's Ray Cornelius speculated, \\"While this tune was not in the original movie, I‚Äôm sure the film‚Äôs producers will make an exception and allow Beyonc√© to perform it or create a new song for her. Let‚Äôs keep our fingers crossed.\\" References Songs from The Lion King 1997 songs Songs from musicals 1990s ballads Mark Mancina songs Songs with feminist themes Soul ballads Pop ballads ","title":"Shadowland (The Lion King)"},{"id":"42954384","text":"Choanograptis argyrocyma is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

The centerpieces of the park are the Stark Burial Ground, where Stark and some of his family are interred, and the 1948 bronze equestrian statue of Stark made by sculptor Richard Henry Recchia. The park was formally opened in 1893, making it one of the city's oldest parks (only Derryfield Park is older). It was originally designed as a typical Victorian- era park, with winding lanes, and a mix of woodlands, lawns, and gardens. A colonnade of elm trees originally lined the three land borders of the park, but were lost to Dutch Elm disease in the 20th century. Some of its paths and vistas have also become overgrown since the park was established. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The Stark family originally owned about of land in what is now northern Manchester. John Stark was buried here after his death in 1822, and the family erected a memorial obelisk in 1829. Stark's great-grandchildren deeded a area surrounding the family cemetery to the city in 1876. Public interest for a larger park memorializing Stark took place in the 1880s, and the family gave another to the city in 1891.

The first church was built in Basco town and was made of cogon and wood. Around 1795, due to frequent fires and typhoons that destroyed buildings, stone churches were started to be built, made possible by imported masons, stone cutters, and carpenters from Cagayan. People began to use lime not as just condiment for betel nut chew, but for constructing walls in combination with sand and stone. During this time, construction of the stone church of Basco took place, with Fr. Nicolas Casta√±o designing the fa√ßade in 1812, and the convent in 1814.

Plot The episode starts with a flashback on how Lester Nygaard obtained the gun which eventually was used by Lorne Malvo to kill the officer during Lester's arrest at his own home. While in jail, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers obtain Malvo's name from Lester. They are released but Lester, whose hand has become severely infected after being hit by one of the shot gun pellets that Malvo fired at Chief Thurman, is taken to the hospital. Molly Solverson rides in the ambulance and tries to get more information from Lester, though he is slightly delirious. She presents her evidence to Chief Oswalt, who is beginning to realize that all the recent events are related. With Stavros close to paying the blackmail demand, Malvo locks Chumph in his kitchen pantry overnight to prevent him from ruining the scheme. Malvo takes Stavros home and leaves. He spots Grimly parked by the road near the house and later follows Grimly to his home, but is confronted in his car by Grimly's neighbor. He threatens the neighbor before driving away.

It is the original house owned by the del Rosario family in Pandacan to whom Apolinario Mabini, known as \\"the Sublime Paralytic\\" and \\"the Brains of the Philippine Revolution\\", was related by affinity. On May 13, 1903, Mabini died of cholera at the age of 39 in this house. The shrine is now located within the main campus of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines in Santa Mesa, after several relocations. It is situated next to the newly-constructed Museo ni Apolinario Mabini (Apolinario Mabini Museum), where some of his belongings and memorabilia can be found. The Mabini Shrine is a government recognized National Shrine (Level 1) and cultural property based on the official lists provided by the National Commission on Culture and the Arts, National Historical Commission of the Philippines and the National Museum of the Philippines.  History  The bamboo-and-nipa house was owned by Cecilio del Rosario and Maxima Castaneda-del Rosario. Apolinario Mabini first lived in this house in 1888, the year he entered law school at the University of Santo Tomas. He continued to live there during most of his adult years. The original house used to be located across the river in Nagtahan, Pandacan, Manila. It was moved to the south bank in 1960, into the Presidential Security Group Compound in Malaca√±an Park in order to give way for the widening of Nagtahan (now Mabini) Bridge. Within the compound, it was restored under the care of National Artist for Architecture, Juan F. Nakpil. In April 2007, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority proposed that the Mabini Shrine be relocated to a new site, as part of a project to widen the river channel in order to let the water in the Pasig River flow unimpeded. Then PUP President Dr. Dante Guevarra successfully volunteered the PUP Mabini Campus as the new site, and a 905-square meter site was reserved for the shrine, hence becoming the third site of the Mabini Shrine. The house was relocated from the Presidential Security Group compound to the Polytechnic University of the Philippines campus further up the river. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority held a widening project along the river and decided to relocate the shrine. Dr. Dante Guevarra, the university president in 2005, welcomed the relocation of the shrine within the main campus of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. On February 8, 2010, former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, issued Proclamation 1992 declaring the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Mabini Campus in Santa Mesa as a permanent home of the Mabini Shrine. In order to prevent another relocation that ‚Äúmay further diminish its historical and architectural authenticity and sanctity as a National Shrine,‚Äù President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo, through Proclamation No. 1992, s. 2010, declared the PUP Mabini Campus to be the permanent home of the Mabini Shrine. A yearlong project was undertaken in 2013 to restore the house and its surrounding grounds.

It links the town of Sintra with Praia das Ma√ß√£s, passing through Colares and close to the Praia Grande. It has a length of some .  History  The line opened in 1904 over the between Sintra railway station and Praia das Ma√ß√£s. A connecting long urban tram route linked the Sintra station with Sintra Vila. Besides passenger traffic, freight was carried, principally between Banz√£o and Sintra station. In 1930, the line was extended by from Praia das Ma√ßas to Azenhas do Mar, but this extension survived only until 1954. The following year, the urban line was closed, leaving just the original line between Sintra station and Praia das Ma√ß√£s. Winter service had ended in 1953, and the line continued to run as a summer only service until 1974. Following the Carnation Revolution of 1975, there was no service on the tramway until 1980. A summer service then resumed, albeit an irregular service over the short section between Praia das Ma√ß√£s and Banz√£o. Following denationalisation of Portugal's provincial bus services in the 1990s, ownership of the line was taken over by Stagecoach Portugal, but the tram services‚Äîwhich operated only during the tourist season‚Äîwas later handed over to the Municipality of Sintra, which re- extended the line over its long-abandoned formation from Ribeira to central Sintra. Damage to the infrastructure occurred in late 2011 when a tree fell on the line and a 1 km stretch of overhead copper cables was stolen, costing the council ‚Ç¨150,000.

He is best known for his work documenting the human impact of nuclear disasters.  Education and career  At 17, Michael Forster Rothbart joined and photographed the Icewalk North Pole expedition. Forster Rothbart graduated from Swarthmore College in 1994 and decided to become a documentary photographer in 1996, when traveling in India. He saw a World Bank-financed dam on the Narmada River in Gujarat and found that local activist's views and community impact was undocumented. He has worked as a staff photographer for the University of Wisconsin and an Associated Press photographer in Central Asia. Other projects include documenting the effects of hydrofracking and USAID's programs in Central Asia. He teaches photography at SUNY Oneonta. He spent 2016-2017 in Donetsk, Ukraine, working for OSCE.  Work in nuclear-affected communities  After receiving a U.S. Fulbright Fellowship, in 2007 Forster Rothbart interviewed and photographed residents in and around Chernobyl. For two years, he lived in Sukachi, Ukraine, a small farming village just outside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and also spent time in Slavutych, Ukraine, the city built after the accident to house evacuated Chernobyl plant personnel. His photos were initially toured to American communities facing their own nuclear contamination as part of an exhibit, After Chernobyl . Forster Rothbart explained that \\"I created this exhibit because I want the world to know what I know: the people of Chernobyl are not victims, mutants and orphans. They are simply people living their lives, with their own joys and sorrows, hopes and fears. Like you. Like me.\\" During each exhibit, Forster Rothbart lead photography workshops and public forums, engaging the communities in dialogue about their own local issues. In 2012, Forster Rothbart launched a parallel project in Fukushima, Japan. He has started photographing nuclear plant workers, refugees and returning residents over a period of years. A book of photos, interviews and essays was published October 21, 2013, by TED Books. Entitled ‚ÄúWould You Stay?‚Äù, it features personal narrative, photos, interviews, maps and audio recordings in an attempt to understand why people refuse to leave Chernobyl and Fukushima despite the risks. He later gave a TED talk about this work. The National Press Photographers Association‚Äôs Best Of Photojournalism 2014 competition awarded ‚ÄúWould You Stay?‚Äù first place in the Multimedia Tablet/Mobile category, third place for Best Use of Multimedia and an honorable mention in the Contemporary Issues category.

The company was founded and controlled by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti through his purchase and merger of MGM/UA Communications Co. and Path√© Communications (unrelated to the French Path√© studio). The company was overshadowed by Parretti's fraudulent schemes and he found himself ousted from the studio in less than a year.  History  Path√© Communications was named after the similarly named French studio. On January 30, 1989, Parretti founded Path√© Entertainment (or Path√© Communications) after purchasing Cannon Films. Path√© Entertainment was named after the similarly-named French studio that Parretti anticipated to purchase. When Parretti had announced his intent to make the purchase, the French government scuttled Parretti's initial bid to buy Path√© due to concerns about his character, background, and past dealings. Alan Ladd, Jr. was appointed as chairman and CEO of Path√© Entertainment. After bids by Parretti to acquire New World Pictures and Kings Road Entertainment went nowhere, Parretti set his sights on purchasing MGM/UA. In the mid-1980s, American businessman Kirk Kerkorian sold portions of MGM/UA to Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System. In 1985‚Äì86, Kerkorian repurchased United Artists and then MGM, but without the company's film library and Culver City lot and film processing labs (entities which had been earlier sold by Ted Turner to Lorimar). In 1989, Kerkorian agreed to sell his MGM/UA interests to Australian broadcasting company Qintex after they tendered an offer of $1.5 billion deal to beat out Rupert Murdoch. However, when Qintex was unable to provide a $50 million letter of credit the deal collapsed. Five months after the Qintex deal fell through, Parretti brokered a deal to make the purchase for $1.2 billion, but questions were raised over Parretti's financial acumen. Parretti gained interest from Time Warner chairman Steve Ross; the company forwarded $125 million to the MGM/UA purchase in exchange for exclusive home video distribution rights to the studio's product. Turner Broadcasting System advanced Parretti $200 million for domestic television rights. Parretti also made deals with Fininvest, Sansea, and Reteitalia to fund the acquisition. He ultimately received backing from a Dutch branch of Cr√©dit Lyonnais to complete the MGM/UA purchase. He then merged it with his Path√© Communications Group, to form MGM‚ÄìPathe Communications Co. in November 1990. Once Parretti took control, he laid off most of the financial staff and offered a major financial role to his daughter Valentina. Soon enough, chaos reigned at MGM. A check to Dustin Hoffman bounced. The opening of Thelma & Louise was delayed due to lack of funds. The studio owed a line of credit to Sean Connery that wasn't paid. There were also reports of unpaid laboratory bills, unpaid creditors, and rather eccentric behavior from Parretti. In March 1991, MGM clients took a complaint to Los Angeles lawyer Stephen Chrystie, claiming that they were owed money ($18 million total) that the studio refused to pay. In turn, Chrystie took this issue up to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. As it turned out, the studio's situation was dire that Chapter 7 bankruptcy was considered. Cr√©dit Lyonnais refused to lend money to MGM any further unless the studio ousted Parretti from his position. Ladd, a former President of MGM/UA, was then brought on board as CEO of MGM in April 1991, and James Kanter as Chief Operating Officer. The new change in management helped save the studio from involuntary bankruptcy. Soon after, Ladd and Parretti began engaging in a bitter power struggle. When it became apparent that Parretti was making plans to regain MGM, Cr√©dit Lyonnais seized control of the studio on June 17, 1991. Parretti faced securities fraud charges in the United States and Europe. On the verge of bankruptcy and failure, Cr√©dit Lyonnais foreclosed in 1992, assigned control of MGM‚ÄìPath√© to a subsidiary, and converted its name back to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. To no avail, Parretti had demanded that the MGM executive committee sell off certain assets in order to pay down the loan to Cr√©dit Lyonnais so that he could regain control, but the committee declined due to concerns over the price adequacy of the portions of the company Parretti wished sold. In July 1993, Cr√©dit Lyonnais replaced Ladd as CEO by bringing in former Paramount Pictures executive Frank Mancuso, Sr. Mancuso then brought in Michael Marcus to head MGM and former Warner Bros. executive John Calley as head of the new United Artists. As part of his exit package Ladd took some of the top properties, including Braveheart. After the split, Path√© revived, but MGM/UA CI did not. The company remained under control of Cr√©dit Lyonnais Bank until 1996, when it was repurchased by an investment group led by Kirk Kerkorian, who in 1997 also purchased Orion Pictures, thus obtaining rights to 1,900 film titles and 3,000 television episodes and bringing the MGM film archives to more than 5,000 titles at that time.

She was the museum's director from 1926 to 1960. Quillin also wrote several field guides relating to plants in Texas.  Early life and family  Ellen Dorothy Schulz was born on June 16, 1892, in Saginaw County, Michigan, the daughter of William and Anna (Millfeld) Schulz. She received an M.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1918 and did postgraduate work at the University of Texas from 1920 to 1922. She married Roy W. Quillin, an employee of Mobil and amateur ornithologist and oologist, on July 29, 1927. The couple had no children.  Career  Ellen Quillin taught in the San Antonio public school system from 1916 to 1933; from 1923 to 1933 she was director of nature study and science. She was an instructor in systematic botany for the University of Texas during the summer terms of 1921‚Äì1923, and a lecturer in natural history from 1927 to 1951. In the 1920s, Quillin was instrumental in organizing the San Antonio Museum Association and raising funds to house the collection of natural history specimens of Henry Philemon Attwater. These efforts culminated in the opening of the Witte Museum on October 8, 1926 under the charter of the museum association. The Witte is devoted to natural history, the history of Texas, and the arts. Quillin was elected the first director of the Museum, a post which she held until May, 1960. On her retirement, she continued as director emeritus, until her death in 1970. The 1930s brought the Great Depression and a challenging economic climate for the Witte and its patrons alike. As a fundraising initiative in response, Quillin built the Reptile Garden on museum grounds, using donated labor and materials. Live snakes, turtles, lizards, and alligators were to be displayed. This somewhat bizarre tourist attraction opened on June 8, 1933. Despite the gimmicky snake-handling demonstrations and turtle races, the Reptile Garden became a research facility for antivenom experimentation and it attracted international scholars. The Reptile Garden also bolstered the Witte's finances for ten years. On closure of the Reptile Garden, the collection of live snakes was donated to the San Antonio Zoo. Quillin served as assistant director (1942‚Äì1950) and acting director (1950‚Äì1952) of the San Antonio Art Institute, an art school that operated from the 1920s to 1992. Ellen Quillin published several scholarly books, articles, and popular works on local botany. The first of these was 500 Wild Flowers of San Antonio and Vicinity in 1922, with photographs by the author. Her most important work, Texas Wild Flowers: A Popular Account of the Common Wild Flowers of Texas, appeared in 1928. The book included folklore and history of the plants, their economic uses, and typical locations. With Robert Runyon, she produced Texas Cacti: A Popular and Scientific Account of the Cacti Native to Texas in 1931, and followed that up with several books on cactus horticulture. A series of nine children's books on nature and science appeared in the 1930s. Quillin co- authored The Story of the Witte Memorial Museum, 1922-1960 in 1966.  Later life and death  Ellen Quillin died on May 6, 1970, of an apparent heart attack, at her home in San Antonio. She was survived by her husband. William A. Burns was named her successor as director of the Witte.  Recognition and legacy  Ellen Quillin was a charter member of the second Texas Academy of Science. She was named a fellow in 1929 and an honorary life fellow in 1949. She served as vice president of the organization in 1942. On the occasion of her retirement from the Witte, the city of San Antonio designated October 30, 1960 as \\"Ellen Quillin Day.\\" She was honored with a citation from Trinity University, a resolution from the mayor, and a reception at the museum. The life and work of Ellen Quillin, including the founding of the Witte, were dramatized in 1999 by the play, A Gallery of Ghosts, by Laura Dietrich.

Centre for Protein Engineering was established in 1990 as one of the MRC's first interdisciplinary research centres and one of the first research laboratories to bring together molecular biology, molecular genetics, biophysics and structural biology into one cohesive unit. It was formed around the research of two prominent scientists who invented protein engineering, Sir Alan Fersht and Sir Greg Winter. Sir Alan Fersht was Director of the MRC CPE from 1990 to 2010, with Greg Winter as Deputy Director. Both, Sir Alan Fersht and Sir Greg Winter were knighted in recognition of their work and for their outstanding contributions to science. From 1990 to 2010 the unit has been extremely successful, both academically and commercially. All of Sir Alan's work on protein folding and much of Sir Greg's pioneering work to humanise antibodies was carried out at CPE. For example, Cambridge Antibody Technology was a biotechnology company founded by Sir Greg Winter in 1989 that was bought for ¬£702 million in 2006 by AstraZeneca. Another successful project that was started at CPE and maintained there until 2010 was the Structural Classification of Proteins database (or SCOP). Over the years SCOP has supported the development of computational tools and contributed to the understanding of protein repertoire, of how proteins relate to each other and how their structures and functions evolved. The MRC Centre for Protein Engineering closed its doors at the end of September 2010, following the retirement of its director, Sir Alan Fersht. Nearly all of the CPE staff, including those maintaining the Structural Classification of Proteins database, and its infrastructure were incorporated into the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB).

In 1852 he met the half-Jewish Ellen Medex, daughter of Charles and Miriam Medex. Although the couple never married they masqueraded as Mr and Mrs Morgan and for over thirty years lived at various addresses in London and Brighton. During these years Ellen gave birth to four children, only one of whom, Ellen Rose (b.1863), survived.Wyndham, Horace: Romances of the Peerage, Holden & Hardingham, 1914 She was baptized Ellen Rose St John Morgan. Despite any evidence of a marriage, Ellen was buried at Highgate Cemetery as \\"Ellen, Viscountess Bolingbroke\\".  Second \\"marriage\\"  After this Henry moved back to Lydiard Park and after meeting Mary Elizabeth Emily Howard, a young servant girl, installed her as his housekeeper. The couple had a formal arrangement whilst at Lydiard Park, but during Henry's absences they met in Bath and lived there as a couple, known as Mr and Mrs Wilson. In 1882 and 1885 Mary gave birth to two boys, who were kept in Bath under the eye of a nurse/governess. In 1893, when Mary became pregnant a third time, she prevailed on Henry to marry her, which he did at Bath Registry Office in 1893. The child was stillborn, but three years later she gave birth to a boy, who was christened Vernon Henry St John, the only legitimate heir to the title.  Feud with peerage publications  Henry then engaged in a long- running feud with the peerage publications, including Debrett's, Dods and Burkes Peerage. In order to 'legitimise' his children so that the eldest son could inherit the title, he tried to pass them off as the offspring of his non-existent marriage to Ellen Medex. Although the peerage books had previously accepted that he was married, they began to unravel the lies and removed all reference of his marriage and any heirs apparent, instead installing one of Henry's cousins, Canon Maurice St John, as heir presumptive to the title.

The Jersey cabbage (Brassica oleracea longata) is a variety of cabbage native to the Channel Islands that grows to a great height and was formerly commonly used there as livestock fodder and for making walking sticks. It is also known as Jersey kale or cow cabbage, and by a variety of local names including giant cabbage, long jacks, tree cabbage and the French chour and chou √† vacque. The 'Jersey cabbage' develops a long stalk, commonly reaching in height, and can grow as tall as . Historically the stalks were made into walking sticks, of which 30,000 a year were being sold by the early 20th century, many for export.; republished Plant Portraits, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (pdf) They were also used for fencing and as rafters. Much of the stalk is bare; the islanders stripped leaves to accentuate this effect and induce it to grow without twisting, varnished the stalk, and created a handle either by heat-treating and bending the root end or by planting at an angle to produce a naturally bent root. The lower leaves were fed to livestockPhilip Miller (one variety in Portugal was grown specifically for the purpose), and were reportedly of great value: The Farmer's Magazine stated in 1836 that five plants would support 100 sheep or 10 cows, and sheep fed them were rumoured to produce silky wool up to in length. The open cabbage at the top is comparatively small: \\"the size of the cabbages at the top was so infinitesimal that one seemed forced to the conviction that nature meant them to be stalks, not cabbages\\".

History Before 1611 Maragondon was established as a separate town from Silang by the Jesuit Angelo Armano. Before this year the Franciscans were already actively evangelizing the area.Cultural Center of the Philippines (1994). CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Volume III. Manila: Cultural Center of the Philippines. In 1630 a second church with more elaborate furnishings was completed. During this year hacienda in Looc, straddling the boundaries of Batangas and Cavite, bequeathed to the Jesuits‚Äô Colegio de Manila, was added to Maragondon‚Äôs jurisdiction. In 1633 a new and bigger church was built to replace the older and smaller one, the church stone for some time between 1646 and 1649. The government ordered its demolition for fear that the Dutch, who were at war with Spain, would use it and other churches near Manila for fortification. The orders were apparently implemented because on May 16, 1650 a license was given to the Jesuits to build a house and church of wood in Maragondon to replace the one that had been demolished. Repairs were made on the convent between 1666 and 1672. In 1687 another church was begun although the construction was interrupted; only in 1714 was it completed. The church was repaired a number of times but data on the renovation are sketchy. After 1860 the Recollect added windows with colored glass panes, and set these in a wooded frame decorated with a quail on a plate, the attribute of San Nicolas de Tolentino. ‚Äù Interior of the Our Lady of the Assumption Parish Church The secular priest de los Reyes also did some repairs probably during the convocation of the second Vatican Council which was commemorated in the Philippines with a jubilee year. To commemorate the event, a roof beam was emblazoned with inscriptions. ‚Äù [Additional data-note from a returning parishioner: While the Church is undoubtedly a Jesuit Church, it shows signs of previous care by the Franciscans. Up the doorway to the sacristy is the image of St. Anthony of Padua and opposite or across it at the other side of the altar is St. Claire. By the way, notably till the 1950s, there were practicing devotees of the Third Order of Franciscans which devotion seems to have disappeared with the death of the last Hermanos (Manong) and Hermanas (Manang). Maybe, we can invite some Franciscans to come and revive such devotions. While in this topic of revival, The Sodality which is a part of our Jesuit devotions seems to be at best anemic. Maybe, we can have a true revival of Marian Devotions by having The Sodality and the Legion of Mary working as one group as true Daughters/Servants of Mary.] Architectural details Maragondon is unique among Jesuit churches for its proportion. The fa√ßade is narrow but tall, not squatty as in other churches. To the left of the fa√ßade is the taller bell tower with no clear divisions between the stories. The bell tower has a quadrilateral shaft that tapers upward with four corners ending with finials. In contrast to the simplicity of its fa√ßade is the ornate door, divided into boxes, with floral designs of different shapes and ships and castles carved on it. Both in and out, the church fabric made of river stones are covered with a layer of paletada (stucco). The elevation found in the fa√ßade is emphasized in the interior by the use of pilasters that taper the upwards. This produces a dizzying effect, as the pillars appear to soar up and sway. The main roof beams are exposed and emblazoned with biblical and commemorative captions. The door leading from sanctuary to sacristy is also carved with flowers enclosed in boxes. Retablo mayor There are three church retables, all brightly polychromed. The image of the Assumption of Mary is placed in the main retable, in the main niche. An image of San Ignacio (St. Ignatius Loyola) to the left and an image of San Luis Gonzaga (St. Aloysius Gonzaga) to the right are also in the main retable. The main retable was decorated using salomonica columns, foliage, and angels with trumpets. Also polychromed in red, blue, gold, and green, is an octagonal pulpit, located at the right side of the church. Its panel decoration includes the names of Jesus and Mary in monograms. The bottom of the pulpit is decorated with swirling foliage that end in an inverted pineapple. A cross, dated 1712, is found near the church‚Äôs main entrance. Part of the convent looks older than the rest. The older part is made of rubble while the newer part is cut stone brick. An elegant staircase of stone and tile are found in the older part. A newer sacristy was added. There are remains of an old defensive wall and a blockhouse that surrounds the quadrangle formed by the church and convent.

Santolan's 200-year-old patron is Sto. Tomas de Villanueva or Thomas of Villanova. The saint was a great Augustinian bishop and man of charity but unknown in the Manila area. The jurisdiction of the parish is as follows: Santolan (North), Marikina River (West), Maybunga San Miguel (South), Cainta, Rizal (East). The church enshrines the 19th century Virgin Mary, said to be different among others, for she has a moon underneath her feet. The parish is one of the three other parishes in the Diocese of Pasig that has been granted the special papal blessing to mark its Diamond Jubilee Year in connection with its 60th anniversary. History of the Parish In 1798, the first chapel made of wood and cogon was built in Santolan by siblings Don Luis and Antonio Victorino. A second chapel made of stone, chalk and tiles was built in the year 1808 by the siblings. It was the biggest chapel built in Pasig. The parish was then established on November 8, 1953, after more than 100 years by Fr. Conrado Arciaga. The first Parish Priest was Alejandro Vermorel who served from 1953 to 1956. In 1956, he proposed the construction of a bigger church and convent. The church was then built with the help of this Parish Priest's fund-raising activity. By the year 1959, the late Archbishop Rufino Cardinal Santos blessed the new church. Architecture of the Present Church The church at present, is a modernized structure with art deco design. Walls are made of concrete. The roofing at the entrance door are made of tiles.

It was designed by architect Charles Bulfinch, and built between 1818 and 1823, with a major expansion in 1844-46. A National Historic Landmark, it is an excellent example of Classical Revival architecture, and a rare surviving example of an early 19th-century public hospital building. The building is home to the Ether Dome, an operating theater which has been separately designated a National Historic Landmark as the site of the first public demonstration of the use of ether as an anesthetic. Description and history The Bulfinch Building is a rectangular structure, two stories in height, with a massive Ionic portico at the center of its longer facade. The building is built out of white granite from Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and stands on a basement of rusticated granite. It has a hipped roof, and the central portion has a square attic story with chimneys at the corners and a saucer-shaped dome in the center. The interior has undergone extensive and repeated renovations, as the hospital's needs for the space have changed. As designed by Charles Bulfinch in 1817 and built over the next five years by Alexander Parris, the building had smaller wings (roughly half the present size), and had a capacity of 73 beds. The stonework for its construction was largely done by the inmates at the Charlestown Prison. The building's capacity was nearly doubled in 1844-46 by the addition of five bays to each of the wings, and the original entrance hall designed by Bulfinch was extensively altered. Bulfinch's design, with an operating amphitheater under the dome, was probably based on that in the Pennsylvania Hospital building, which he probably saw on a visit in 1816. That amphitheater, now known as the Ether Dome, is where the first public demonstration of the use of ether as an anesthetic took place on October 16, 1846. The amphitheater was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 in recognition of this event. The entire building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and designated a National Historic Landmark, in 1970, as an excellent example of Classical Revival architecture, and as one of the oldest public hospital buildings in the nation. The building is now surrounded by the much larger modern facilities of the hospital.

The company is licensed by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission and the Alderney Gambling Control Commission and is certified by third-party testing houses. The company has raised a total of $23 million in venture funding from, among others, Venture51, Greylock Partners, and Founders Fund. History Christopher Griffin, the company‚Äôs current CEO, founded Betable in 2008. The first iteration of the service involved users creating betting opportunities and placing bets on a central, social-oriented gambling site. In July 2010 the company raised $3 million in seed funding from Atomico Ventures. In 2012, Griffin re-capped the company and re-launched Betable from being a betting site to developing a real-money gambling platform. The Betable API beta program was released in July 2012, allowing game developers to integrate Betable betting features. In October 2012 Betable partnered with game developers Slingo, Digital Chocolate, and Murka Games to incorporate betting into the developers' current offerings. In November 2012 Mandala Games became the first European game developer to use the Betable platform, enabling real- money play in its title Slots by La Riviera. In November 2013 Betable raised an $18.5 million Series A funding round led by Venture51. =TechCrunch April Fools' slot machine= On 1 April 2013, news website TechCrunch published a hoax article claiming that it would be launching a social betting game for venture capitalists to gamble at, remarking that it would be \\"an even easier way to bypass SEC regulations around being an accredited investor\\". The article included a TechCrunch-themed slot machine that was powered by Betable software. Products and services Third-party game developers use the Betable API to apply real-money gambling functionality to mobile games. In addition to converting standard games (such as slots, blackjack, and roulette) into real-money gambling titles, the software can be used to create non- traditional types of gambling games that operate on top of the Betable platform. Once installed, Betable acts as a turnkey gaming engine that manages all real-money tasks within a game such as identity verification, anti-fraud safeguards, regulatory compliance, transactions, auditing, and gambling mechanics. The platform acts as an alternative to other forms of app monetization, such as banner ads or freemium models, by allowing developers to enable revenue-generating betting features within their games. Because Betable possesses gambling licenses from the United Kingdom Gambling Commission that allow it to provide gambling services on another party's behalf, developers can enable betting within their games without applying for any licenses themselves. Betable is compatible with games on iOS and Android operating systems. =Battle Keno= One example of a traditional gaming title being converted to a real-money gambling app through Betable's platform is 30AK Gaming's Battle Keno, an adaptation of Battleship that financially rewards or penalizes players based on gameplay. =Prospect Hall Casino= In February 2015, Betable launched Prospect Hall Casino, a UK online gambling business with online casino games for mobile and web.

It is the national tree of Paraguay, declared as such in the N¬∫4631 Act of May 10, 2012, as proposed by the School of Chemical Sciences at the National University of Asunci√≥n in celebration of the bicentennial of Paraguay's independence. Description Handroanthus heptaphyllus can reach up to 40 m in height. The bark is brown-gray, very rough, with deep cracks in adult specimens. H. heptaphyllus requires specific light and humidity conditions, and is susceptible to frost when young. The tree is considered decorative, and is frequently used in parks, squares and public woodland. Its leaves are palmate compound with opposite orientation. Each compound leaf contains 5-7 elliptical leaflets that are 10-15 cm long and have serrated edges. The tree is semi-deciduous with purple/pink tubular flowers that develop before the leaves. The flowers can vary in color from bright pink to pale pink or even white. The fruit of H. heptaphyllus is shaped like a long pod up to 30‚Äì40 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide. The pods are brown when ripe and eventually open longitudinally and drop up to 150 winged seeds. It withstands high winds and has a strong and deep root system. Flowering begins in the first half of September. Approximately 30 days after flowering begins, the first leaves begin to appear. Ripe fruit appears between January and February. Properties The wood is hard and heavy, with noticeable differences between sapwood and heartwood. The heartwood turns a dark color with oxidation. The wood is very weatherproof. It is used in the construction of boats, docks, truck beds, beams, crosspieces, stairs, floors, as well as woodturning. Sawing produces a pale yellow sawdust containing lapachol. The wood has tannins and pigments. The sawdust or wood chips, bark and leaves can be used for medicinal purposes. The tree is easily propagated by seeds. The number of seeds/kg is 32,000 to 35,000. Planting should be done as quickly as possible, as the seeds will only germinate during the first 12‚Äì15 days. Vegetative propagation through the rootstock is also possible. In this species, certain trees produce white flowers. These \\"white lapachos\\" are often reproduced by grafting.

Early years Jacques Antoine Creuz√©-Latouche was born at Ch√¢tellerault, Vienne, on 18 September 1749 to a Poitevin family of magistrates. He qualified as a lawyer in Poitiers and practiced at the bar in Paris. He spent some time in Switzerland before returning to Ch√¢tellerault in 1784 where he bought the office of lieutenant general of the s√©n√©chauss√©e of Ch√¢tellerault. In 1787 he sat in the assembly of the province of Poitou. Deputy On 31 March 1789 Creuz√©-Latouche was elected deputy to represent the third estate of Ch√¢tellerault in the Estates-General of 1789. He was not active in the tribune but was active in committee work. He specialized in matters of finance and economics. As a member of the committee on coins he was a strong defender of the assignat, whose fate he linked to that of the French Revolution. After the National Constituent Assembly formed on 9 July 1789 Creuz√©-Latouche became judge of the High Court of Orleans, while continuing to play an active role in the Ch√¢tellerault Jacobin Society. In 1790 he joined the Jacobin club in Paris. On 12 April 1791 Creuz√©-Latouche was elected to the Court of Cassation by his department. He left the Jacobin club during the split in July 1791 between the Feuillants and the radicals, then rejoined at the end of July 1791. He was vocal in opposing refractory priests. On 5 March 1792 he voted to requisition objects of worship made of precious metals so they could be used to make coins and ingots. On 5 September 1792 Creuz√©- Latouche was elected to represent the department of Vienne in the National Convention by 177 out of 311 votes. He sat with the Girondists in the Convention. He advocated free trade in food in 1792, and pushed this position more vigorously in the spring in 1793. His strong support for liberalizing the grain trade earned him a reputation as a \\"physiocratic sympathizer\\". He was often described as belonging to the Plain. Due to his positions on free trade and his collaboration with several periodicals associated with Jean Marie Roland and Jacques Pierre Brissot he was clearly one of the Girondins. At the trial of King Louis XVI of France he voted against the appeal to the people, for detention followed by banishment and then for suspension. Later career Due to Creuz√©-Latouche's relative lack of political activity he was not included in the arrests that followed the fall of the Gironde in the insurrection of 31 May ‚Äì 2 June 1793. He gave protection in his home to the daughter of Roland. He stayed away from politics until the Thermidorian Reaction of 27 July 1794. He was a supporter of the new census system, which he helped implement as a member of the committee of eleven set up to revise the constitution. In Germinal, year 3, he sat on the Committee of Public Safety. On 31 January 1795 Creuz√©-Latouche spoke in the National Convention calling for the addition of a chair in political economy in the newly established √âcole Normale. The measure was approved with little debate. On 21 Vend√©miaire, year IV, Creuz√©-Latouche was appointed to the Council of Ancients, where he played an important role in the fight against the clergy. He said \\"the priests were the instigators of all evil and all the crimes that had desolated the earth. \\" He was firmly opposed to the royalists and supported the coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797) in which the French Directory took power. He was elected to the Council of Five Hundred in Prairial, year VI, and was appointed president. Creuz√©-Latouche supported Napoleon's coup on 9 November 1799, and was appointed to the Senate in Niv√¥se, year VIII. He was also a member of the Institute. He died in Paris on 23 October 1800.

It is long and flows through North Centre Township and Orange Township. The stream's watershed has an area of 3.72 square miles. It flows through a steep ravine which is inhabited by numerous plant species for much of its length. The fossil-rich Stony Brook Beds also have an outcropping near the stream. In the 1870s, it was considered for use as a water supply by the Bloomsburg Water Company. Course Stony Brook near its headwaters Stony Brook starts in northwestern North Centre Township, on the southern edge of Knob Mountain. It begins flowing southwest and almost immediately crosses Pennsylvania Route 93. Shortly afterwards, it leaves North Centre Township, after which it enters Orange Township and continues southwest, where it enters a valley. The valley gets steeper as the stream turns south and then west, flowing north of Summer Hill. The stream crosses Pennsylvania Route 487 and shortly reaches its confluence with Fishing Creek. Stony Brook joins Fishing Creek upstream of its mouth and upstream of Lightstreet. Geography, geology, and hydrology Stony Brook flows through a steep and narrow valley for part of its length. The elevation of the stream is above sea level. The bed of Stony Brook consists of cobbles. An outcropping of the rock formation known as the Stony Brook Beds is visible on the side of a road at the mouth of Stony Brook. This rock formation consists of shale and has a high concentration of fossils, including two varieties of spirifier. The habitat around Stony Brook allows for a relatively high water quality; the stream's water is quite clear, but there is a risk the water quality could be impacted by runoff from nearby residential and agricultural lands. Watershed and tributaries The Columbia County Natural Heritage Inventory from 2004 designated the watershed of Stony Brook as a \\"locally significant site\\". It has an area of 3.72 square miles, and no tributaries. The stream is in the Bloomsburg USGS Topographical Quadrant. The valley of Stony Brook is forested and largely undeveloped. Although there is agricultural land upstream of the valley and on both sides of it and a housing development located on one side of the valley, there is no road going through the valley, and the Columbia County Natural Heritage Inventory strongly discourages the construction of one, stating that it would \\"be the most destructive action against this Exceptional Value Waters stream.\\". History In the 1870s, the Bloomsburg Water Company attempted unsuccessfully to use Stony Brook as a water supply. In 1938, a concrete tee beam bridge was built over Stony Brook. It is long and carries Pennsylvania Route 487. The average traffic over the bridge is 6310 vehicles per day, as of 2013. In 2009, 25 local volunteers cleaned up of 17.15 tons of debris that had been left at the confluence of Stony Brook with Fishing Creek during a flood in June 2006. Stony Brook is named for the fact that rocks are found in large numbers near it. Biology Power line crossing Stony Brook near its headwaters The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has designated the entire length of Stony Brook as an Exceptional Value Stream, giving it some legal protection. The trees in the valley of Stony Brook are mostly hemlock of various ages. Other trees inhabiting the valley include beech, basswood, two varieties of oak, yellow birch, black cherry, pignut hickory, tulip poplar, white ash, and sugar maple. There is also a substantial population of herbaceous plants in the bottom of the valley, particularly ferns: nine species have been recorded. Native woodland flowers inhabit the edges of Stony Brook. These include blue cohosh, false hellebore, twisted stalk, miterwort, golden saxifrage, barren strawberry, false Solomon's seal, Solomon's seal, Canada violet, purple trillium, wild stonecrop, trout lily, dwarf ginseng, and white baneberry. An overhead power line crosses the valley of Stony Brook in one location. The area in its vicinity is inhabited by high numbers of invasive plants, such as multiflora rose. There are small numbers of the hemlock woolly adelgid, which is considered a pest, in the watershed. In higher numbers, this insect could damage the watershed's hemlock forests.

It is the most destructive defoliator of coniferous forests in western North America. Distribution It is now widely distributed throughout the Rocky and Coast Mountains. The first recorded outbreak was in 1909 on the southeastern part of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Since that year, infestations have frequently been reported in western Canada.Fellin, D. and J. Dewey (March 1992). Western Spruce Budworm Forest Insect & Disease Leaflet 53, U.S. Forest Service. Retrieved on: September 14, 2008. The budworm was first recorded in 1914 in the United States, in Oregon. However, it was not initially recognized as a serious threat to coniferous forests in the western U.S. Aerial spraying apparently terminated some smaller epidemics in the southern and central Rockies; others subsided naturally. The insect then appeared to be dormant in US forests until 1922, when two outbreaks were reported near Priest Lake in northern Idaho. Since then, significant outbreaks in the Rockies and in the Pacific Northwest have caused top-killing and serious economic losses in tree growth. Tree mortality from budworm can occur in regeneration, sapling, and pole-sized trees. Trees in mature stands severely defoliated by the western spruce budworm may become susceptible to bark beetles, which kill mature trees. Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia defoliated by western spruce budworm (Choristoneura freemani) near Blewett Pass summit, Chelan County Washington Impact Considered the most destructive defoliator in British Columbia, sustained outbreaks of the western spruce budworm resulted in defoliation of over in the Fraser Canyon - Lillooet - Pemberton area from 1949-58. From 1970 -2001 further outbreaks occurred over a much larger area including the area of the previous outbreaks, as well as the Thompson and South Okanagan areas in 1970-2001.Natural Resources Canada. Western spruce budworm . Conifer Defoliating Insects of British Columbia. Canadian Forestry Service. Retrieved on: September 14, 2008. There is no typical pattern for western spruce budworm epidemics. Most of the early epidemics subsided naturally after a few years. Others persisted longer, but without spreading over large areas. An epidemic which began in 1949 in the northern Rocky Mountains has persisted for over 30 years despite insecticidal treatment of more than between 1952 and 1966. =Description= Western spruce budworm caterpillar, sixth (final) instar Adult moths are about 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) long and have a wing-spread of 7/8 to 11/8 inches (22 to 28mm). Moths of both sexes are similar in appearance, although the females are a bit more robust than males. Both sexes fly. The gray- or orange-brown forewings are banded or streaked, and each usually has a conspicuous white dot on the wing margin. Eggs are oval, light green, and about 3/64 inch (1.2mm) long and overlap like shingles. Larvae develop through six stages. Newly hatched larvae are yellow-green with brown heads. In the next three stages, larvae have black heads and collars and orange- or cinnamon-brown bodies. In the fifth stage, larvae have reddish-brown heads marked with black triangles, black collars, and pale olive-brown bodies marked with small whitish spots. Mature larvae are 1 to 11/4 inches (25 to 32 mm) long, with tan or light chestnut-brown heads and collars and olive- or reddish-brown bodies with large ivory-colored areas. Pupae are 1/2 to 5/8 inch (13 to 16 mm) long, broad at the head end, and narrower toward the tail. They are brownish yellow or brownish green at first, and later turn reddish brown. =Life Cycle= Throughout most of its range, the western spruce budworm completes one cycle of development from egg to adult within 12 months. Moths emerge from pupal cases usually in late July or early August; in the southern Rockies, adults often begin emerging in early July. The adults mate, and within 7 to 10 days, the female deposits her eggs and then dies. Each female deposits approximately 150 eggs, usually on the underside of conifer needles. Eggs are laid in one to three-row masses containing a few to 130 eggs, with an average of 25 to 40 eggs per mass. Larvae hatch from eggs in about 10 days. Larvae do not feed, but seek sheltered places under bark scales or in and among lichens on the tree bole or limbs. Here, they spin silken tents in which they remain inactive through the winter. In early May to late June, larvae leave their hibernacula to search for food. They first mine or tunnel into year-old needles, closed buds, or newly developing vegetative or reproductive buds. New foliage, which is normally the preferred food, is usually entirely consumed or destroyed before larvae will feed on older needles. Larvae become full grown usually in early July about 30 to 40 days after leaving their overwintering sites. Larvae pupate in webs of silk they have spun either at the last feeding site or elsewhere on the tree. The pupal stage usually lasts about 10 days. Taxonomy The species was originally named Choristoneura occidentalis by Freeman. However, this name was already in use for an African species described by Walsingham. The replacement name for this North American species is Choristoneura freemani.

It was published in 2013. The novel is about a mother's bond with her son; about life choices; about the military, war, and service to one's country. The story is narrated by a woman named Sara whose son Jason is a member of the Special Operations Force in the Navy SEALs. Her son is subsequently deemed missing after a fictional raid on May 2, 2011, the night that Osama Bin Ladin had been killed. Sara is thus left in limbo, waiting to hear about the whereabouts of her missing son. Plot summary Sara's son Jason is missing from a Special Operations Forces mission undertaken on the same night as the Bin Laden raid. As Sara waits for news, in a series of flashbacks we learn about Jason's absentee father, while through letters home from his training and early missions, we get a picture of Jason as a strong, compassionate leader who is wise beyond his years and modest about his abilities. Those exceptional abilities give Jason the chance to participate in a wholly different level of assignment, the most important and dangerous of his career.

Early life and family  He was the oldest son of Humphrey Mackworth Praed (c. 1718‚Äì1803) of the manor of Trevethoe, near St Ives in Cornwall. His father was a Member of Parliament for St Ives and then for Cornwall. His mother Mary was a daughter of William Forester, the MP for Wenlock. He was educated at Eton College and at Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1778, he married Elizabeth Tyringham, daughter of the banker and MP Barnaby Backwell, of Tyringham in Buckinghamshire. They had ten children.  Career  Tyringham Hall in 1818. A partner in his family's banks in Cornwall, Praed also founded Praed's & Co in Fleet Street, London. His family mostly controlled the borough of St Ives, which elected him to the House of Commons at the 1774 general election. An election petition was lodged alleging various forms of corruption, and Praed's election was declared void. He won the resulting by-election, and thereafter spent enough money to secure control of the borough until 1802, when he sold one of the seats. Having already built a new country seat at Tyringham Hall in Buckinghamshire, he sold Trevethoe manor, and his interest in Cornwall waned. In 1806 he sold the second seat, and secured election at Banbury, where his money had won over the corporation. That election was voided on petition, and Praed lost the resulting by-election; he never returned to Parliament. Praed's business interests were a higher priority than parliamentary affairs, and he was particularly focused on the Grand Junction Canal, of which he was chairman. He steered through Parliament the bill which authorised its construction, and Praed Street in Paddington (near the canal's Paddington Basin) is named after him. Death He died in October 1833 and was buried in Tyringham Church with a monument carved by William Behnes.Dictionary of British Sculptors, 1660‚Äì1851, Rupert Gunnis  References  1747 births 1833 deaths People educated at Eton College Alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford English bankers English businesspeople Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for constituencies in Cornwall British MPs 1774‚Äì1780 British MPs 1780‚Äì1784 British MPs 1784‚Äì1790 British MPs 1790‚Äì1796 British MPs 1796‚Äì1800 Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for constituencies in Cornwall UK MPs 1801‚Äì1802 UK MPs 1802‚Äì1806 UK MPs 1806‚Äì1807 UK MPs 1807‚Äì1812 Tyringham ","title":"William Praed"},{"id":"42955812","text":"Thurlow Bergen in Monte Cristo Thurlow Weed Bergen (1875‚Äì1954) was an American actor of stage and silent film.

View from Poplar Walk of Christ Church Meadow. Poplar Walk is wide footpath running north‚Äìsouth in Christ Church Meadow, Oxford, England. The footpath runs between The Meadow Building of Christ Church at the junction with Broad Walk to the north and the River Thames near Folly Bridge to the south. At this point, the river is known as \\"The Isis\\" and is the location of the end of rowing races for Oxford University events such as Eights Week in the summer and Torpids in the spring. There used to be ornate wooden barges on the river here to house rowing facilities and for viewing races. Now the barges are gone and there are boathouses instead a little further down the river near the junction with the River Cherwell. Poplar Walk is still used as a route to and from the boathouses. There are good rural views to the east across Christ Church Meadow, even though Poplar Walk is quite centrally located in Oxford. Poplar Walk was laid out in 1872 and lined with poplar trees by Henry Liddell, Dean of Christ Church and the father of Alice Liddell of Alice in Wonderland fame.

The album had a sale of 250,000 copies in the first year of its release. It was one of the first Brazilian albums to be totally recorded with computers. and it sees Russo covering English- language songs by Madonna, Bob Dylan, Nick Drake, Billy Joel, among others.  Background and planning  Russo took inspiration from a Nick Drake album to create his solo debut. Because the economical moment was favorable, the label gave him total freedom to create his material. The original plan was to do a special show with Russo singing accompanied by Carlos Trilha on the piano in order to raise funds to the A√ß√£o da Cidadania Contra a Fome, a Mis√©ria e Pela Vida (Citizen Action Against Hunger and Poverty and for Life) campaign, created by Herbert de Souza, who died in 1997 of AIDS-related issues.BRock - O Rock Brasileiro dos anos 80, Arthur Dapieve, Editora 34 After an initial performance at actor Marco Nanini's house and after listening to Trilha's keyboard programming for the show, Russo decided to register the project in studio while keeping its fundraising objectives towards that campaign. 48 songs were prepared for the album, but only 21 made it to the final track list. Four had to be cut in the last minute due to a 70-minute limitation imposed by the CD factory; these were later released on the posthumous solo album O √öltimo Solo (the source says 30 of the 48 songs were disposed of). Russo believed he was the only one to know \\"Cathedral Song\\" at that time, but singer Z√©lia Duncan released her self-titled debut album that same year and it contained a Portuguese-language version of it.  Concept  The album was a tribute to twenty five years of the Stonewall riots in New York City. The cover is a tribute to Rock 'n' Roll, de John Lennon, and shows Russo by the door of his building at Rua Nascimento Silva. The building's number was digitally removed later in order to preserve the musicians privacy.

History Elizabeth Saunders Home is an orphanage in Japan established in 1948 by Miki Sawada, a Mitsubishi heiress,\\"Mitsubishi History Volume 22\\" with the original intent of housing biracial children, typically those born between men of the occupying US Armed Forces and Japanese women, who were abandoned by their parents and ostracized by Japanese society immediately after World War II.\\"Hobart and William Smith Colleges\\" The orphanage was created on the former property of the Iwasaki (founder of Mitsubishi-see Yataro Iwasaki) family's detached residence located in Oiso, which had been confiscated by the Japanese government in lieu of property tax payment during World War II. Miki Sawada bought the land back for 4 million Yen that she managed to collect, in part by selling her personal property. The name Elizabeth Saunders was adopted in honor of the first donor to the orphanage soon after reacquisition of the land, during which time Miki Sawada (having spent all her money) was struggling to run the orphanage. Elizabeth Saunders was an Englishwoman that had spent 40 years in Japan as a governess in the service of the Mitsui family both prior to World War II and throughout the war years. Prior to her death in Tokyo, in 1946 she asked that her charitable bequest be left to work under the auspices of the Anglican Church in Japan. Miki Sawada never met Elizabeth Saunders, receiving news of her donation through intermediary Lewis Bush and the Anglican bishops acting as executors to the charitable trust. The groundbreaking ceremony for the home was held on 26 October 1947 attended by Allied Church Club benefactors and long-term supporters of the orphanage such as Paul Rusch. Elizabeth's charity enabled Miki Sawada to register her orphanage as a Non-Profit Organization for the first time, and opened the door for future charitable connections.\\"„Ç®„É™„Ç∂„Éô„Çπ„Éª„Çµ„É≥„ÉÄ„Éº„Çπ„Éª„Éõ„Éº„É†„ÅÆ„ÅÇ„ÇÜ„Åø\\" (Chronology of Elizabeth Saunders Home) According to Miki Sawada's autobiography, \\"Èªí„ÅÑËÇå„Å®ÁôΩ„ÅÑÂøÉ\\" (literally \\"Black Skin, White Soul\\"), while she was on a train in Gifu Prefecture of Japan in the earlier part of 1947, the dead body of a black baby wrapped in layers of newspaper and cloth fell from an overhead compartment onto her lap. By this time Miki Sawada who was married to an ambassador of Japan had traveled extensively prior to World War II. During her travels she had volunteered at one of Dr. Thomas John Barnardo's orphanages in England. Nevertheless, according to her biography, this incident with the deceased baby was what ultimately made her decide to open Elizabeth Saunders Home.\\"Knowledge is Power\\" (A synopsis of Miki Sawada Autobiography) In the book ‚ÄúTrans-Pacific Racisms and the U.S. Occupation of Japan‚Äù by Yukiko Koshiro, the author describes a post war Japan that together with the US, smoothed over and attempted to make taboo the topic of racism that had been so prevalent, if not outright encouraged, against each other by both sides during the war. As described in Yukiko's book, Miki Sawada believed that racism directed at biracial babies set in this atmosphere, especially those shown toward babies with black fathers, made it necessary for her to not only open Elizabeth Saunders Home but also to find a way to get them adopted back to their paternal country. Her actions and comments at the time were considered controversial, and vocalization of both criticism and approval resonated from both sides of the Pacific.\\"The Japan Times\\" (Occupation Orphan Traces Roots)\\"Foreign Affairs\\" (Website published by the Council on Foreign Relations)\\"Trans-Pacific Racisms and the U.S. Occupation of Japan.\\" (Website shown for synopsis of the book) St. Stephan's School In 1953 Miki Sawada opened an elementary school for the children at Elizabeth Saunders Home to attend.

According to documents, he visited during a storm through the gate of El Rastro or of La Paja in the Muslim defensive wall, which was known as Bib-al-Rambla. It became the central square of Granadine social life in the 16th century. In 1515 it was decorated with the Catholic Monarchs' coat of arms. In 1610 the new national symbols commemorating the reconquest of Spain from Muslim rule were added. Puerta Real has suffered many changes during its life. Until the 19th century Darro River ran through it, but it was enclosed for reasons of hygiene. Until then Granadine social life had centred round Elvira Street and Nueva Square, but Puerta Real then became more popular. Several commercial establishments were set up in Puerta Real, including the no longer existing Casino. Areas inside Puerta Real Another important place was the Swiss Caf√©, located next to Mesones Street, also built in the late 19th century. Another area inside Puerta Real is Genil Avenue, so named because it was built over Genil River. At the end of this street, we can find the place where Genil River and Darro River meet.

The second named storm of the season, Boris developed from the interaction of a low-level trough and a Kelvin wave south of Mexico late on June 2\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, the system moved generally northward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Boris by midday on June 3\\\\. About six hours later, Boris peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) - indicative of a weak tropical storm. By early on June 4, interaction with land caused the storm to weaken, deteriorating to a tropical depression. Later that day, Boris degenerated into an area of remnant low pressure, before fully dissipating over the Gulf of Tehuantepec on June 5\\\\. As Boris approached land, tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued, school classes were canceled, and evacuations occurred in Southwestern Mexico and portions of Guatemala. The precursor to Boris and the storm itself brought heavy rainfall to area. In Mexico, overflowing streams left minor damage in Chiapas; four people were injured when a house partially collapsed. One death was reported in the country when a tree fell at a high school in Xalapa. Flooding in Guatemala forced 198 people to flee their homes. A mudslide caused five deaths and injured seven others. Overall, 20 mudslides were reported, damaging 13 roads. Additionally, 223 homes were damaged, including 11 severely. More than 5,000 people were left isolated in Quetzaltenango after a portion of the main road to the city was inundated by water. Meteorological history Early on May 30, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather, perhaps in connection to a tropical wave, several hundred miles south of southeastern Mexico for tropical development within a five-day period. Within an increasingly favorable environment for formation, the disturbance was assigned a medium chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours later that day, and a high chance of development on May 31 as it became increasingly better organized. In conjunction with a ship observation and satellite intensity estimates, the disturbance acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression at 2100 UTC on June 2. Over the subsequent hours after its formation, little change in organization was noted, with multiple low-level centers rotating within a broader circulation positioned on the south side of the deepest convection. However, a pair of Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) passes early on June 3 revealed sustained winds just above the tropical storm threshold, and the depression was subsequently upgraded to Tropical Storm Boris. Despite initial forecasts of several days over water, the center of circulation moved quickly northward in response to an upper-level low west of the system, and the bulk of Boris's deep convection moved ashore near Chiapas, Mexico around 0600 UTC on June 4. However, the cyclone's northward motion slowed, and the low-level circulation remained offshore, failing to ever make landfall. Thereafter, the system degenerated into a trough of low pressure about 80 mi (130 km) east-northeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Preparations and impact Infrared satellite loop of Boris approaching Chiapas on June 3 A few tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued as Tropical Storm Boris approached Southwestern Mexico. At 21:00 UTC on June 2, a tropical storm watch was posted from Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, to the Mexico-Guatemala border, which was upgraded to a tropical storm warning early the following day. The tropical storm warning was discontinued by 09:00 UTC on June 4\\\\. In Chiapas, 122 municipalities were placed on alert and schools were suspended in four of them. All but four municipalities in Chiapas were placed on \\"yellow\\" alert, while the remaining four were placed on \\"orange\\" alert. Statewide, around 16,000 were evacuated. Education services were suspended for 30 municipalities in Oaxaca. Comisi√≥n Nacional del Agua warned residents to expect up to of precipitation in Chiapas and Oaxaca, of rain in Veracruz and Tabasco, and in Campeche and Quintana Roo. Due to the threat of mudslides in Guatemala, classes were suspended in nine school districts, affecting 1.25 million pupils. \\"Orange\\" and \\"yellow\\" alerts were also posted for the entire country. A total of 434 emergency response teams were set up to deal with landslides. Boris and its precursor disturbance brought heavy precipitation to Guatemala, peaking at in Mazatenango, Suchitep√©quez. Over 5,000 people were left isolated in Quetzaltenango, after heavy rainfall left about of the main road to the city inundated with water. Five people were killed in a mudslide, seven were hurt, and 55 were evacuated in Guatemala. A total of 223 homes were damaged, including 11 severely. Twenty landslides were reported, resulting in damage to 13 roads. One hundred ninety-eight people sought shelter. Throughout Southwestern Mexico, rainfall amounts of were common, though the highest total observed was at Tres Picos, Chiapas. In that state, some streams overflowed their banks, resulting in minor damage. There, four minor injuries occurred when a house partially collapsed. Inland, in Xalapa, a high school student died and three others were wounded when a tree fell on campus. Overall, damage totaled at MXN$700 million (US$54.1 million), including MXN$689 million (US$53.2 million) to infrastructure. Following the storm, aid was quickly provided to victims. Authorities authorized the delivery of 41,700 mats, and of water.

Early life  The real last name of Charlotte is unknown, although according to a few sources her true name was Elsa Jane Guerin. The name she used to enlist in the Union Army was Charley Hatfield. She was born in a rural Iowa town in 1840. In 1858, her mother died when Charlotte was 18 years old. Her step- father treated Charlotte as a hired hand. When she was only 19 years old, she eloped, but her husband spent most of his time away from Charlotte, due to gambling habits. After giving birth to a stillborn baby, Charlotte's husband beat her severely and left her. She later heard that her husband left her to be with another woman. She subsequently vowed revenge on both her husband and his mistress. To get her revenge, Charlotte decided to travel West with her mule to find her husband. During her trip, she successfully disguised herself as a man in order to avoid the problems of a woman traveling alone. Along the way, she met an old friend named George West who was partaking in the hunt for gold at Pikes Peak. In each town she visited, she was able to gather information to track down her husband and his mistress. Finally, after arriving in Colorado, she faced the two of them and exacted her revenge, though the details of their encounter are unclear. Charlotte shared her story with George West, asking him to swear that he would not share it for 25 years.  Civil War  At the start of the Civil War, both George West and Charlotte enlisted, George served as an officer in Colorado while Charlotte became a member of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry Regiment at Keokuk, Iowa. Because women were not allowed to serve, Charlotte dressed as a man and enlisted using the alias Charley Hatfield. In that persona, she worked as a spy for General Samuel R. Curtis where she \\"volunteered to infiltrate the Confederate lines dressed as a woman carrying eggs from her home.\\" The Confederates allowed here into their camp to sell her eggs, and in the process she gathered valuable information by eavesdropping. This allegedly contributed to Union victory over Major-General Sterling Price's Confederate \\"Army of Missouri\\" at the Battle of Westport on 25 October, 1864. During the battle she was injured after her horse was shot from beneath her. She also sustained a gunshot wound to the leg and a cut on the shoulder. She was brought to a Confederate hospital to be treated when the doctor, Jesse Terry, realized that Private Hatfield was actually a woman. She convinced Terry to keep it a secret, and as rebel field hospitals were temporary, especially on battlefields where the Confederates lost, she was subsequently transported under either a parole or humanitarian pass to the US Army hospital at Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas where she completed her recovery. Charley later found out that General Curtis had written to the Governor of Iowa to have Private Hatfield promoted to 1st Lieutenant. The approval came from the Governor and Charley was promoted as well as made aide-de-camp to General Curtis. Charley served for the remainder of the Civil War, never having anyone discover that she was in fact a woman except very likely Curtis.  Later life  After keeping his promise for 25 years, George West finally told Charlotte's story to a newspaper that published the story on January 14, 1885. Charlotte read it and, writing to George, informed him that she say was remarried and had been living happily with her husband and four children for the past eight years. Charlotte asked West to keep her name and address a secret, which he did, thus concealing her true last name for subsequent generations of researchers.  Different versions of Mountain Charley  There have been several versions of the \\"Mountain Charley\\" story. In 1861, her story first appeared in an autobiography exploring her journey dressed as a man in California and Colorado. Two drastically different versions of Mountain Charley subsequently appeared in Western newspapers. One of these was an adventure series piece entitled, \\"Mountain Charley joins a Wisconsin regiment, fights through the war, then goes to Wyoming, where she runs a gambling house, and by 1879 lands in prison.\\" The second story read much like the one that George West published in 1885. Based on research, the history of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry perfectly matches the story General George West's account of \\"Charley.\\" However, no Charles Hatfield was found on the roster of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry. A Charles Hatfield enlisted in Company F of the 23rd Iowa Infantry, but was supposedly rejected on September 19, 1862. It may be possible that Charlotte Hatfield, also known as Elsa Guerin, failed on her first attempt to enlist, but was successful on a second attempt. No personal record could be found to support this theory Because there are many different versions of the story, it may be likely that Charlotte Hatfield's story \\"was a composite of the experiences of several woman settlers.\\"  References   Further reading  Bowman, John S.

This was at the time a novel idea, as it was only the previous year that recordings by the first all-female band of the pop era, Goldie and the Gingerbreads, had appeared, followed shortly thereafter by The Pleasure Seekers, featuring a young Suzi Quatro. Britt initially put together a 4-piece band comprising herself, Kaye Gazzard, Wendy Walton and Judy Owen. They performed a mix of instrumentals and contemporary pop and rock and roll songs. Their first gig was at Stomp City, AMOCO Centre, Orange in June 1965, where they drew a record crowd of 2030.Janice Harris, When Orange was Stomp City, Central Western Mail, 9 June 2010. Accessed 6 June 2014. Following this a fifth member ‚Äì Janice Glading (stage name Babs King) ‚Äì was added on vocals.James Cockington, Mondo Weirdo: Australia During the Sixties, Mandarin Press, Port Melbourne, 1992. The Vamps played the Millers Hotel circuit in Sydney and other venues through to the end of 1965. They also appeared on the Don Lane television show, performing \\"Twist and Shout\\". At one point in late 1965 Richard Neville of OZ magazine fame was considering managing the band, but he left for London early in 1966. In February of that year Britt put together a new version of the Vamps, with Jan Little, Merlene Ryder, Elaine Neilsen and Lisa-Kay James. They toured extensively throughout eastern Australia, including the showground circuit in Queensland. During September they were joined by Denise Cooper on vocals, following the departure of Neilsen. Whilst performing in Brisbane the Vamps recorded two numbers for the IN television show on BTQ7, these being \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" and \\"Hanky Panky\\".The Vamps on IN. TV Times, 28 September 1966.The Vamps on IN. TV Week, 15 October 1966.

Marks and Iain MacIntyre, Wild About You: The Sixties Beat Explosion in Australia and New Zealand, Verse Chorus Press, 2011. This was short-lived and they only played a few gigs in Melbourne and Sydney. Britt replaced the three Victorians in July with Julie Hibberd, Carol Middlemiss, Val Falloon and Denise Cooper. Falloon had recently arrived from England where she had written and produced a single for Mike Hamilton which was issued on Decca Records.Mike Hamilton, The Time is Over / You Wont be Alone Anymore, 45Cat. Accessed 6 June 2014. The Vamps went on to tour Vietnam between October 1967 and March 1968, with stopovers in Noum√©a on the way there and Singapore on the return trip. Following their arrival in Australia in April 1968 Val Falloon left and was replaced by Joy Carroll. The band then performed in venues along the east coast before heading off on a Pacific Islands and South East Asian tour in September. The Vamps were out of the country until February 1969, at which point they once again played in Sydney and Melbourne, before leaving for the United States in May of that year. The Vamps toured as an all-female 4-piece with various personnel through to March 1971 when Margaret Britt's husband Jon Kirk joined the band and it was renamed Jon and the Vamps, or Jon and the Australian Vamps. They played in Australia during a brief visit in April 1972 and upon returning to the United States in June the band was expanded to an 8-piece. They performed around the country in 38 States, including Hawaii, almost continuously until February 1975, with Margaret Britt the only non-American member. Upon returning to Australia in 1975 the Vamps travelled throughout New South Wales, Victoria and to Birdsville, Queensland. In 1977 a new all-female line-up was recruited by Britt and adopted the name Peaches, following a recommendation from Gene Pierson of Laser Records, Melbourne. Peaches worked in Australasia and the Pacific through to 1980 when Britt disbanded the group. =Vietnam= In September 1967 the Vamps left Australia for Vietnam and a proposed 12-month tour of American, Australian, Korean and Vietnamese military bases. They performed at numerous localities, often driving themselves to gigs in an unescorted kombi van.Marc Leepson, Mara Wallis's Documentary On Show Folk In Vietnam, The VVA Veteran ‚Äì The Official Voice of Vietnam Veterans of America, March / April 2003. Accessed 6 June 2014. Their tour took them to front line bases such as Landing Zone (LZ) Ross, Danang, where in November 1967, during a performance on an open-air stage, they were subject to a mortar attack by the Viet Cong who were just 200 yards away. The band had to cut short their set and were dragged into bunkers by the soldiers. They remained there until they could be choppered out to safety. Whilst in Saigon Britt was subject to a roof-top sniper attack and in January 1968 the band was awarded a plaque by the US forces for their courage and performance on the front line.Jacqueline Smith, The Vamps weren't afraid of the Viet Cong. Australian Women's Weekly, 5 June 1968.

They returned to Australia in February 1969. =United States= The Vamps left Australia in May 1969 for an 8-week tour of the United States and stayed for 6 years. The 4-piece initially comprised Margaret Britt, Carol Middlemiss, Julie Hibberd and Joy Carroll. Middlemiss departed in September and was replaced by American Mary Kay Kuenzli. At the end of 1970 both Carroll and Kuenzli left and were replaced by the Petrak sister, Cheryl and Micky. They were part of the line-up when the Vamps performed at Tehachapi Prison, California in February 1971. Shortly thereafter the Petraks left and the band now became Jon and the Australian Vamps, comprising Margaret Britt, her husband Jon Kirk, Julie Hibberd and American Diane Smith. This 4-piece worked through to the latter part of 1971. Smith left for a period and the group was joined by drummer Nancy Kuminkovski. This line-up recorded two singles in September 1971. Smith subsequently rejoined the band and following a brief visit to Australia in April 1972 both her and Hibberd left upon their return to the States. Britt and Kirk subsequently put together an 8-piece band and performed around the country and at events such as the Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500. They were based out of Green Bay, Wisconsin, and had gigs in Las Vegas, Birmingham, Nashville, St. Petersburg, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, to name a few. All told some 38 States were visited by the band between 1969‚Äì75.

The game was nominated for the Spiel des Jahres prize in 2012 and won the √Örets Spel prize in the Best Adult Game category in 2013.Las Vegas at the Spiel des Jahres website (in German)Las Vegas at BoardGameGeek Rules Las Vegas is a game for two to five players. It consists of six small boards representing different casinos (originally depicting real Vegas casinos; later the same casinos with faux renamings; in the US release, simply numbered boards with similar decorative backgrounds), a deck of 54 \\"bills\\" (cards) in various denominations of the United States dollar (from $10,000 to $90,000 in $10,000 increments), an additional \\"First Player\\" card (denoting who starts each round of play) and five sets of eight dice, each set colored differently (orange, green, blue, black and white). The US release also included a dice pouch for storing the game dice. The game is played for four rounds. At the start of each round, each casino is randomly dealt a bill from the deck. Each casino must hold at least $50,000. If the bill's worth is less than that, the casino is dealt additional bills, until the casino holds at least $50,000. Players take turns throwing their dice. At the start of a round, each player is holding all of their eight dice. After the dice are thrown, the player must choose which casino they are betting on. This is done by choosing a number and placing all the dice showing that number on the respective casino. Betting is mandatory; there is no option to voluntarily pass a turn. A player can only pass a turn when he/she has no dice left for the round. Once all players have bet all their dice, the winnings are dealt out. For each casino, the winnings go to the player who bet the most dice on that casino. The majority has to be strict - on a draw, the winnings go to the player with the next most dice, or if all players are equal, the winnings go back to the deck. In case a casino holds multiple bills, the top player receives the largest bill, and the smaller ones in order of decreasing value are awarded to the runner-up players, with unawarded bills being returned to the deck. After each round is scored, the players get their dice back, the casinos are dealt a new set of money and the \\"First Player\\" card is given to the next player in play order. After four rounds, the player who has won the most money wins the game. *NOTE: The rules include a variant using the white dice as a \\"phantom\\" player who can prevent the other \\"real\\" players from scoring. The white dice are evenly (as possible) distributed between the players, who roll and place them alongside their own dice. Expansion An expansion set, titled Las Vegas Boulevard, was released in 2014. The expansion (which went under the pre-release titles of Las Vegas Lights and Las Vegas Plus) included additional dice in yellow, grey and purple (allowing for up to 8 players in regular play) plus additional white dice for expanded play, \\"large\\" over-sized dice that count as 2 dice, a seventh \\"slot machine\\" casino board, additional $100,000 \\"bills\\", and various other cards to be used for variant play included with the expanded rules (such as \\"rainbow\\" cards, action cards, bonus cards, etc.).

The firm was closed after declaring bankruptcy in 1894. History Founded in 1884, the firm was named after Clemens' niece‚Äôs husband Charles L.

The first two American publications of the firm, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885) and the Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant (1885) were highly successful. The Ulysses S. Grant memoir publication in particular financially helped Grant and his family at a time when Grant was sick, having been diagnosed with throat cancer.

After Grant's death, Clemens gave Grant's widowed wife, Julia, a substantial royalty check of $450,000, the equivalent of 11 million dollars today. According to Webster, prior to his death, Grant dictated the last part of the second volume to a stenographer working for the firm, due to writing fatigue, starting with Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Webster, who accompanied the stenographer, respected Grant's reputation and honored his request to keep secret from reporters that Grant dictated part of the book. Other books later published by the firm were not as successful and soon Clemens had to reinvest profits back into the firm to make up for losses. In 1888, as the company financially suffered, Clemens fired Webster, who was at odds with him on how to run the firm successfully. Webster, himself, had been overworked traveling throughout the United States visiting the firm's principle agents. As the firm grew deeper in debt, Clemens was forced to close the business having formally declared bankruptcy on April 18, 1894. The firms most productive years, although not financially, were from 1891 to 1893. Notable authors published, including Clemens, were Leo Tolstoy, Henry George, and Walt Whitman. Charles L.

In 2019 he was sentenced to 5 years in prison, reduced to 3 years and 4 months due to the abbreviated trial on charges of abuse of office. He was suspected as involved in organized crime and of helping his cousins in international drug smuggling while serving as Minister of Interiors. Early life and education Tahiri was born in Tirana, on October 30, 1979. Tahiri is in process of completing PhD studies in the area of Parliamentary Law in Albania. He holds a master's degree in public law from the University of Tirana, Faculty of Law, and has a bachelor's degree in law from University of Tirana, Faculty of Law. He has been awarded the title of lawyer since 2008. In 2006 to 2008, he was a part-time lecturer at the Faculty of Law and several other higher education institutions. Political career In 2009, he was elected Member of the Assembly representing the Socialist Party for Tirana Region in the 18th Legislature. He was also appointed vice chair of the Parliamentary Group. In 2011, Tahiri was elected as chairman of Tirana Socialist Party Branch. From 2009 to 2013 he was a member of the Committee of Legal Affairs, Public Administration and Human Rights. =Minister of Interior= On 15 September 2013, he was appointed as Minister of Internal Affairs in the 1st Rama Government. During the first months of his mandate, following the prime minister's orders, Tahiri ordered raids on Lazarat, a secluded village in Albania's south, famed for industrial-scale cannabis cultivation. During the raid, 71 tonnes of marijuana were seized by the Police. In the following years, the drug situation in Albania and the war on illegal trade became a bigger problem and a huge concern for the international community. On February 18, the opposition launched a protest, which continued for 3 months. One of the main demands was the resignation of Saimir Tahiri. On March the 12th, four ministers of the Cabinet, including Tahiri. =The Wiretap Scandal= On October 16, 2017, the Guardia di Finanza of Catania arrested the members of an Albanian‚ÄìItalian mafia group including 4 Italians and 3 Albanians. According to the Italian prosecution, the criminal group had trafficked over 3.5 tons of cannabis, guns and other weapons over the last few years, with a yearly profit of ‚Ç¨20 million. Among the persons arrested was also Moisi Habilaj, one of three Habilaj brothers, well known to the Albanian public because of frequent public accusations for drug trafficking to Greece and Italy. The Habilajs were Tahiri's cousins and during his time as Minister of Interior, the Opposition accused him of collaborating with the Habilaj Gang. In the transcripts of the Italian police, that wiretapped while investigating the Habilaj Case, came also Tahiri's name. Immediately after that the Prosecution Office asked the country's parliament to greenlight the arrest of MP and former Interior Minister Samir Tahiri, after confirming it suspected he had played a role in a crime ring smuggling cannabis to Italy. On November 8, the Socialist Majority in the Parliament denied the request by the Prosecution Office for Serious Crimes and before that Tahiri was expelled from the Parliamentary group of the Socialist Party. On May 3, he resigned from his MP status while the investigation went on for months. In September 2019 Prosecutors demanded 12 years in prison for Saimir Tahiri under charges of participation in a criminal organization and international drug trafficking.https://exit.al/en/2019/09/10/prosecutors-demand-12-years-in- prison-for-former-albanian-minister-saimir-tahiri/ On 19 September, the Serious Crime Court sentenced Tahiri to 5 years in prison, which is reduced to 3 years and 4 months due to the abbreviated trial.

He is most notable for presiding over the trial of Jeremy Thorpe in 1979. Early life Cantley was born in Manchester, where his father was a general practitioner. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School and then studied law at Manchester University. He was called to the bar at Middle Temple in 1933, and came top in his bar finals examination, gaining first-class honours and the Certificate of Honour. Legal career He became a barrister in Manchester, with a pupillage under Denis Gerrard and then practising on the Northern Circuit. Cantley served in the British Army in the Second World War, first in the Royal Artillery and then on staff appointments, spending time in North Africa and Italy. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1945, and was demobilised as a lieutenant colonel. He returned to the bar after the war. He had a mixed practice, specialising in contract law cases. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1954, and a Bencher at Middle Temple in 1963. He served as Treasurer at Middle Temple in 1981. One of his last trials was leading for the prosecution when Gwynne Evans and Peter Allen were convicted for the murder of John Alan West in 1964, which led to the last two judicial executions in Britain before the abolition of the death penalty in 1965. Judicial career Cantley became Judge of the Court of Record in the Hundred of Salford in Lancashire in 1960, and was Judge of Appeal in the Isle of Man High Court from 1962 to 1965. He was appointed as a High Court judge in 1965, allocated to the Queen's Bench Division, and received the customary knighthood. He was Presiding Judge on the Northern Circuit from 1970 to 1974. He had a low public profile until he presided at the trial of Jeremy Thorpe in May‚ÄìJune 1979, shortly after the 1979 UK general election on 3 May 1979 - so much so that no press agency could find a photograph of him. Thorpe was acquitted, and Cantley's summing up roundly condemned the prosecution witnesses and praised the defendants, while claiming not to express an opinion. At the 1979 Secret Policeman's Ball, in aid of Amnesty International, the biased summing up speech by Mr Justice Cantley was parodied by Peter Cook. The sketch was written and delivered shortly after the trial and was, according to Freeman and Penrose, \\"actually not that different from the original.\\"Freeman and Penrose, p. 365 The nine-minute opus, \\"Entirely a Matter for You\\", is considered to be one of the finest works of Cook's career. Cook and show producer Martin Lewis brought out an album on Virgin Records entitled Here Comes the Judge: Live of the live performance together with three studio tracks that further lampooned the Thorpe trial. Notwithstanding marked and widespread public disquiet at the biased summing-up in the Thorpe trial, Cantley was considered as Presiding Judge on the South Eastern Circuit, but declined in order to become Treasurer of Middle Temple in 1981. Personal life and death Cantley married Hilda Goodwin Gerrard (n√©e Jones) in 1966, widow of his former pupil-master, Albert Denis Gerrard. He retired from the bench in 1985. In later life, he lived with his wife in the Temple and attended the Temple Church.

History  Dayton Sure-Grip & Shore was founded in 1924by Art & Carl Kinnenger with help from Charles Danis and Fred Kramer. Carl Kinnenger held the patent on the snap tie design (to hold formwork together) and Dayton Sure-Grip & Shore was licensed to sell it in the U.S. out of their Downtown Dayton location. In 1953, Danis Hunt Construction acquired Dayton Sure-Grip. After beginning bar support production in 1959, Sure-Grip, Inc is founded in 1960, and the company relocated to Miamisburg, Ohio. In 1975, Dayton Sure-Grip purchased C&M; Chemical Co. out of Sycamore, Illinois, beginning their production of chemicals. After the purchase of Superior Concrete Accessories in 1982, the company changed their name to Dayton Superior Corporation. A series of acquisitions followed, leading to international expansion (purchased Superior Concrete Accessories of Toronto and Cogan Wire Company of Montreal), and the purchase of Symons Corporation. Symons specialized in form systems, and manufactured shoring, formliners, and chemicals, drastically expanding Dayton Superior's number of products offered.

Black Arab comes to the city of Salonica and imposes a daily tax upon its citizens, which includes a young woman for his entertainment. When the turn comes for Dojƒçin's household to pay the tax, his sister is to be given to the Arab. Dojƒçin rises from his sickbed after nine years of lying, and confronts the Arab. After killing him, he returns to his bed and dies in peace.Stojƒçevska- Antiƒá 1979, pp. 5‚Äì9 In some variants of the narrative, Dojƒçin has a wife, who attends him together with his sister. In most variants, there is another villain beside Black Arab‚ÄîDojƒçin's own blood brother, a blacksmith. Before the duel, Dojƒçin's sister or wife asks the blacksmith to shoe his horse on the promise to pay later for the service. The blacksmith, however, asks her to sleep with him, which she refuses with indignation and tells Dojƒçin about the incident. Dojƒçin, having killed the Arab, visits the blacksmith and cuts his head off.Stojƒçevska-Antiƒá 1979, pp. 10‚Äì15 The traditional notion that the long illness is a punishment for a grave sin is found in a number of variants. In a Macedonian version, a group of heroes, including Dojƒçin and Prince Marko, assembled at the Graƒçanica Monastery in Kosovo. Dojƒçin jumped over the monastery's church, disregarding Marko's warning not to do that, for which he was cursed by Saints Nicholas, Petka, and Catherine. In another Macedonian version, Dojƒçin improperly kissed three female saints he encountered in a church. In this regard, his fight with Black Arab can be seen as his atonement for his sins, which is explicitly stated in some variants. In the variant recorded by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá in 1815 from a Bosnian Serb merchant, a disintegration of the heroic paradigm is clearly expressed. In the initial part of the poem, it is stated several times that there is no hero in Salonica who would dare to face Black Arab. Comments on the city's prominent fighters have a derisive tone; e.g., Duka could not fight because his arm hurt. This unheroic background stands in contrast to Dojƒçin's behaviour, which is a full affirmation of the heroic ethos.Deliƒá 2011, pp. 120‚Äì21 The variant found in the Erlangen Manuscript, which is dated to the early 18th century, reflects the spread of the Ailing Dojƒçin narrative from a Serb environment to a Croatian one. The hero is renamed as Ivan Karloviƒá, who was the Ban of Croatia (then part of the Habsburg Empire) from 1521 to 1524 and from 1527 to 1531. He was a prominent fighter against the Ottomans, who also attacked his own estates. The plot of the poem is located not in Salonica but in Solin, a town on the eastern Adriatic coast. \\"Solin\\" is a near-homonym of the Serbo-Croatian name for Salonica, \\"Solun\\". In its history, the town was the object of military attacks.Deliƒá 2011, pp. 112‚Äì15 Origins It is unclear whether Ailing Dojƒçin is based on a historical person. Possible candidates are despots John VII Palaiologos and Andronikos Palaiologos, who governed Salonica from 1402 to 1408 and from 1408 to 1423, respectively. They defended the city from the Ottomans, and they were both known for poor health.Deliƒá 2011, pp. 105‚Äì9 The epic poetry about Ailing Dojƒçin could have been influenced by the tales of miracles of Saint Demetrius, the patron saint of Salonica. He is said to have saved the city when it was besieged by Slavs and Avars at the end of the 6th century. The saint appeared on the city's walls as a soldier armed with a spear. To enable Dojƒçin to rise from his bed, his sister firmly wrapped his legs and torso with a bandage, because his bones became disconnected. This reminds of the bones of a saint placed in a reliquary.Deliƒá 2011, pp. 110‚Äì11 Ailing Dojƒçin is also interpreted as \\"the embodiment of an oppressed and humiliated nation's desire for revenge\\".Djuriƒá 1966, p. 329 Notes References  Characters in Serbian epic poetry Bulgarian folklore Macedonian literature Fictional Macedonian people Fictional Bulgarian people Fictional Serbian people ","title":"Ailing Dojƒçin"},{"id":"42956618","text":"Osinachi Joseph (n√©e Kalu), known professionally as Sinach, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter and senior worship leader at Loveworld.

History The church was built by Pope Pius X as a memorial of the 16th centenary of the Edict of Milan (313), when Roman Emperors Constantine I and Licinius acknowledged Christianity as a licit and lawful religion within the Empire; it was dedicated to Constantine's mother, Helena. The church ‚Äì based on a design by the architect Giuseppe Palombi ‚Äì was built between 1913 and 1914, opened to worship on April 2, 1914 and was consecrated on 17 September 1916. The church rises in the so-called Quarto di Sant'Elena (\\"Quarter of St. Helen\\"), mentioned into documents dating back to the last years of the 14th century. An act by notary A. Scambi dated May 10, 1379 refers to an eight-rubbi (14,7 hectares) vineyard placed \\"in quartum qui dicitur sancta Erina\\". The prior of the cloister of Santa Maria Nova, on October 15, 1382, sold the fruits from the \\"terre da sancta Helena\\" (\\"lands of St. Helen\\") through an administrative deed by the Roman notary Venettini. St. Helen's estate bordered on the hamlet of St. John Lateran and on the hamlet of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. On November 25, 1424 the cloister of Santa Maria Nova sold to the Lateran Chapter a plot of 25 rubbi (46,2 hectares) through a deed by the Roman notary Nardo Venettini (Arch. Cap., Sez. I, t. 785 bis, vol. 10 f. 186). The edifice received the title of Parish Church on March 19, 1914 by Pope Pius X, through the apostolic constitution \\"Quod iam pridem\\", thus receiving the rights and incomes of the suppressed Parish of Santi Quirico e Giulitta in the Forum of Augustus. Since 1985 it is a titular church with the name Sant'Elena fuori Porta Prenestina. The plaque commemorating Raffaele Melis in Via del Mandrione. On the railway protective wall, close to the crossing between Via del Mandrione and via Casilina, a travertine cross commemorates the vicar Raffaele Melis, killed on August 13, 1943 by the second bombing of Rome ‚Äì that struck the train of the former Rome‚ÄìFiuggi railway, full of people repatriating from Africa ‚Äì while giving aid to wounded people.

In addition to teaching at Penn State, Reardon is a visiting professor at United States Military Academy at West Point and has taught at the U.S. Army War College. Reardon has been a faculty member at Marine Corps Command and Staff College, U.S. Army War College, U.S. Army Military History Institute, and University of Georgia. Additionally, Reardon was the Associate Editor on The Papers of Henry Clay Documentary Editing Project. Reardon is a scholar-in-residence at the George and Ann Richards Civil War Era Center at Penn State University, and an associate professor.  Publications  Soldiers and Scholars: The U.S. Army and The Uses of Military History, 1865-1920 examines the purpose and abuse of military history. It was thought that the professionalization of the army would allow U.S. military officials to be aware of many different strategies that would lead to a positive or negative outcome. However, many argued that military history only prepared soldiers for previous wars, and not current ones. * Launch the Intruders: A Naval Attack Squadron in the Vietnam War, 1972 explores the acclaimed Linebacker campaign, a series of forays from the USS Saratoga undertaken by Attack Squadron 75 (known as \\"Sunday Punchers\\"). This text profiles the pilots and mechanics of Squadron 75, looking at their lives of the lives of their families to provide an interesting look at the Vietnam War. * \\"William T. Sherman in Postwar Georgia's Collective Memory, 1886-1914\\" is a chapter in the book Wars within a War, edited by Joan Waugh and Gary W. Gallagher. Reardon's chapter examines the memory of William Sherman after the Civil War and how public opinion of him gradually declined after the worst phase of Reconstruction had passed. * \\"From 'King of Spades' to 'First Captain of the Confederacy': R.E. Lee's First Six Weeks with the Army of Northern Virginia\\" is a chapter within the text Lee the Soldier, edited by Gary W. Gallagher. Reardon's section explores the change in the remembered perception of Robert E. Lee created during the Seven Days campaign. When Lee was chosen to army command he was not considered to be an important military leader. The Seven Days Battles did create many major supporters of Lee; however, there were many vocal critics as well. Many newspapers and Lee's military subordinates judged Lee's military achievements harshly. It was not until Lee's death in 1870, that his remembered image became heroic. It was not until the 1930s when Douglas Southall Freeman published the book \\"R.E.Lee\\" that provided an intellectual critique of Lee. Additionally, there have only been three major texts examining the Seven Days Battles. * \\"Civil War Military Campaigns: The Union\\" is a chapter in the book A Companion to the Civil War and Reconstruction edited by Lack K. Ford. Reardon's chapter analyzes the shifting views of why the North won the Civil War. Immediately, after the Civil War few explored the reasons that the North had won one reason is that many did not find the reasons relevant. The first inquiries as to why the North won came from military leaders in the late 19th century and the early 20th century and those authors believed that President Abraham Lincoln was a greater reason for winning the war than General Ulysses S. Grant. In the 1950s, Authors Bruce Catton, Allan Nevins, and T. Harry Williams demonstrated that there were greater reasons for winning the war than just the fact that the North had more resources than the South possessed. The Civil War centennial promoted more academic discussion of the Northern victory. Most agreed that the South could win. Furthermore, many argued that the North had a better management system with soldiers and civilians. Finally, between 1900-2000 there was a rise in the study of Civil War battle studies and authors found that the North adopted quicker to the rifle and had access to better military technology than the South, which was a large reason for the Northern victory. * \\"Pickett's Charge: the Convergence of History and Myth in the Southern Past\\" is a chapter in The Third Day at Gettysburg and Beyond edited by Gary W. Gallagher. Reardon's section examines the changing views of Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett and Pickett's Charge on the third day at Gettysburg. Following the battle, the Confederate soldiers blamed each other for their defeat, rather than the Union soldiers. The press reported on rumors and accusations which immediately led to an incorrect history laced with gossip. Pickett's men observed how Lee's death help create a heroic image of him and decided to employ the same methods with Pickett. They used romanticism and Southern-style literature and became seen by the public as heroes. However, a man named William R. Bond was not satisfied with the Virginian version and wrote many articles on why North Carolina troops were the true heroes. This led to Pickett's widow entering the literary war over the third day at Gettysburg. She referred to Pickett as \\"My Soldier,\\" and told heartwarming stories about him.  Interviews  = An interview with Carol Reardon: On Civil War history, literature, and popular memory = Reardon state that she still believes that historians are interested in literary and nontraditional sources because these sources allow the reader to understand many different aspects of society. For instance, women and children's studies can be researched through non-traditional sources, such as schoolbooks, songs, poetry, etc. Nontraditional sources can fill in the blanks between the home- front and the battlefield. She thinks they are both wartime literature and post-wartime literature are important. Wartime literature allows historians to determine what the understanding of the war was. Post-wartime literature is important because it allows historians to see how understanding has changed. What was remembered, what was lost, and what was changed that may have no foundation in reality. The question that comes from comparing those sources is why they changed. Additionally, literature allows historians to know the underlining emotions that the author felt and sales enable historians to see if the public felt the same way. The literature demonstrates the political and social strains during that time period. Reardon believes that sources that combined nonfiction and fiction are good tools to develop strong historical methodologies. Historians need to research to determine if the author could have known the information at the time or it became knowledge after the fact. Reardon explains the difference between Civil War novel and the Civil War memoirs. With the novel, the author enters the project with no desire to keep within nonfiction; however, with memoirs, authors begin with the intention to stay true, yet once history becomes either dark or boring they add fictional elements. Reardon uses the Battle of Gettysburg to demonstrate how popular memory of the Civil War changes. Now, the Battle of Gettysburg is seen as a unifying symbol and the end of the Civil War; however, that was not always how it was seen. After the Civil War, Gettysburg was primarily targeted to inspire pride in the Union Army and the North. Many Southerners did not make the journey to Gettysburg because there was not much incentive to attend. It was not until the late 1880s that the Battle of Gettysburg began to be expressed in the dramatic unifying moment in United States' history. Finally, Reardon examines the novel The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara. Reardon argues that the novel is useful creates a different perspective of actors in the Civil War which allows people to being to study historiography. Additionally, a fictional novel can promote the public to begin to read non-fiction work on the Battle of Gettysburg. However, Reardon cautions that readers believe that the characters are real and if they are not, it can turn them off from reading.  Television appearances  = C-Span: open phones with Carol Reardon = This appearance was to discuss the history of the Battle of Gettysburg on the 150th anniversary. She was asked how the celebrations have changed over the years. Reardon explains that the greatest amount of monument buildings that are on the Gettysburg field happened in the 1880s to 1900s. The monuments were often built by the Civil War Veterans who wanted to have a large say in the design of the monument. The 73rd New York monument is a soldier and a fireman because many of the soldiers were firemen and they wanted to show how the fireman could become the soldier. 42nd New York monument is a Native American teepee, it represents Tammany Hall which was the Democratic Political Machine in New York. Between regiments, there were arguments over the land to place their monuments. Both the 2nd and 11th core wanted Cemetery Hill. The original ruling by the Gettysburg Part authorities was that it should be the 11th core because they were the ones who were mainline was actually on Cemetery Hill. However, the 2nd was necessary on the line at Cemetery Hill when the Confederate Soldiers broke through briefly on the night of the 2nd. Additionally, the 2nd did not have a main section anywhere else to build their monument. On another note, Confederate soldiers were not allowed to be buried at the National Cemetery and were buried wherever they left. And it was until the 1870s, that Southern women decided to raise the money to bring the bones back home. Reardon discusses paroled soldiers. Initially, when a soldier was paroled they had to promise to go home until they were notified that they had been exchanged. However, many soldiers continued to stay home after they received their notification, so they created parole camps. These camps held the paroled soldiers and leaders from both Union and Confederate parole camps would meet and agree on an exchange. If a soldier was officially exchanged then they would be told to go back to their regiment. = C-Span: Pickett's Charge panel = This television appearance was a discussion panel including the following historians: Troy Hartman, Jeffry Wert, Richard Sommers, and Peter Carmichael. One topic that Reardon discussed is that Lee concluded to attack reasonably. He evaluates all his options compared them to his ultimate objective. Reardon explains that the first thing that Lee witnessed of day one of Gettysburg is the final attack of the day. It was an attack on open ground and it was a smaller scale of what was later be used at Pickett's Charge. Additionally, on the second day a small amount the Confederate forces were able to get close to the Union line. Ultimately, Reardon argued that Lee asked himself the question 'What can I do?' and then devised a logical plan for the third day. One issue Reardon explains is that it is not concretely known what was Lee's intention at Gettysburg because there are not a lot of primary sources. For example, there were no notes taken at the meeting between Jefferson Davis and Lee; thus, it is not known was discussed there. At the time of the Civil War, it was not required that there be a commander's intent. Reardon does discuss that the purpose of artillery bombardment was to destroy the Union's artillery to hit an area target of both Clump of Trees and Ziegler's Grove. Reardon also discussed how historians believe that Lee was aiming for the seam between two different Union groups. At the end of the talk, Reardon explains how the Union army did a great job at Gettysburg. Awards Reardon has been awarded the Helen Dortch Longstreet Prize from the Longstreet Society (2009), Victor Gondos Memorial Service Award from the Society for Military History (2009), George W. Atherton Award for Excellence in Teaching from the Penn State University (2007), and William Woods Hassler Award for Excellence in Civil War Education from the Civil War Education Association (2004).

Cheng became a prominent evangelical leader and Chinese nationalist and gained international attention in the 1920s. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Cheng joined other Protestant leaders to form the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which promised independence of foreign financing and control in return for religious autonomy. He became disillusioned and openly criticized the government's policies on religion in 1957. Although he was not arrested, he was severely criticized and died in obscurity in 1963. Early life Cheng was the second child of a poor barrel and cask maker, born near the prosperous mid-Yangtze valley city of Wuchang, Hubei. His father had briefly attended a mission school and joined the Congregational church When Cheng was six years old, his father and uncle opened a lumberyard which was successful enough that Cheng was able to attend a primary school run by charity. He still often had to leave school to help in the family business. At age 16, Cheng entered the Wesley College (Powen Middle School) in Wuchang, where he was among the first Chinese to study with the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden. After graduation, Cheng took a job in a local business in order to support his parents, but his new marriage, apparently a happy one, ended after only six months in 1906 with the death of his wife. Her death brought on what he later called \\"the greatest crisis in my life\\". Believing that he had been called to a mission in education, he left his career in business to work full-time in the Covenant Mission school. In 1907, the Covenant mission sent him to Sweden to raise money for a seminary in China, a project that drew support also from the American-supported Covenant mission in North China and the Swedish-financed on in south China. The first book he published, Eko fr√•n Kina (Stockholm, 1921), was written in Swedish, which he translated into English as Echoes from China (Chicago, 1921). Returning from Sweden by way of the United States, he visited the American headquarters of the Covenant church in Chicago. While there, he enrolled as an undergraduate at Wheaton College, an evangelical institution, where he applied credits from China and worked straight through in order to graduate in one year, at the age of thirty-eight. Faith and nationalism, 1921-1949 Upon his return, Cheng joined what historian Daniel Bays calls the \\"Sino-Foreign Protestant Establishment,\\" which included such figures as Zhao Zichen, David Z. T. Yui, and Frank Rawlinson, whose theology was more liberal than Cheng's fundamentalism. Following the May Thirtieth Incident of 1925, in which British-led troops killed unarmed student demonstrators in Shanghai, Cheng was forced to resign from his teaching post. For the next two years, he served as a chaplain in the army of Feng Yuxiang, known as \\"the Christian General\\". When Feng aligned with the revolutionary Nationalist Party of Chiang Kai-shek, Cheng resigned from the chaplaincy. The Covenant Church of Sweden in 1928 invited him to visit in order to demonstrate their success in attracting charismatic Chinese. En route, he participated in the International Missionary Council Conference in Jerusalem, a convocation that did much to advance the cause of ecumenical Christianity outside Europe and North America. On his return once again to China, Cheng taught Bible and theology at the Hunan Bible Institute in Changsha, Hunan, where he remained from 1929 to 1937, while editing the journal Evangelism and conducting widely attended speaking tours that made him nationally prominent. In 1935, however, Cheng and other faculty expected that the new president of the Institute would be Chinese, as would have been required by Chinese law if the school had been secular. They wrote to the Board of the Institute in Los Angeles to explain their reasoning. When the appointment of a non-Chinese who was unpopular with staff and students was nonetheless carried out, Cheng gradually withdrew and left the Institute in 1937. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in August 1937, Cheng offered to re-join his original home, the Covenant Mission group in Central China in spite of his longstanding reluctance to work in foreign-dominated organizations. The Mission Board in California accepted this offer, but the leaders in China rejected it, perhaps because they felt that he would operate autonomously. Cheng then became an evangelist with the China Inland Mission in Sichuan. He visited Singapore in 1941, where the Japanese invasion delayed his return for two years. On his return to Chongqing in 1943, the Mission supported him in establishing the Chungking Theological Seminary, which became his base. He served as its president until 1953, presiding over a faculty of both Chinese and foreign members. During the war years, the Chinese Communists presented a program of patriotic resistance and promotion of social justice. Progressive Christians such as Wu Yaozong of the YMCA and even some relatively conservative evangelicals such as Cheng became sympathetic to their promise to serve and uplift the poor. In 1950, one of his China Inland Mission associates reported that Cheng had \\"gone for the new regime hook, line, and sinker\\". Religion and revolution after 1949 After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Cheng and such Protestant leaders as Wu Yaozong and Cora Deng organized the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, a government-sponsored group that promoted Christianity independent of foreign money and foreign leadership. He was a member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the People's Alliance. When the \\"Hundred Flowers\\" movement of 1957 encouraged criticism of the Party and the government, Cheng spoke out against corruption. Citing the doctrine \\"Love CountryLove-Church\\", Cheng and Wu Yaozong called for the government to follow the policies of religious freedom in Article 88 of the Constitution. They politely but firmly criticized officials who saw spiritual belief as a \\"defect\\" and who carried out campaigns to attack religion. The Three-Self Movement then adopted a leftist program. Cheng was one of seven church leaders to come under their intense criticism, and was severely criticized until his death. His funeral in March 1963, however, was conducted by Wu Yaozong. Family life Cheng's son, Chen Renbing (1909- 1990) was an American-educated sociologist.

The location was part of the eastern half of occupied Poland, which had been invaded by the Soviet Union in 1939 in agreement with Germany, and two years later captured by the Wehrmacht in Operation Barbarossa. It is estimated that from May 1942 until November of that year, during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in Poland, some 50,000 Jews were murdered at Bronna G√≥ra forest in death pits. The victims were transported there in Holocaust trains from Nazi ghettos, including from the Brze≈õƒá Ghetto and the Pi≈Ñsk Ghetto, and from the ghettos in the surrounding area, as well as from Reichskommissariat Ostland (present-day West Belarus). The Brest Ghetto Passport Archive (former Soviet Union). JewishGen 2014. Background After a century of foreign domination, Second Polish Republic became an independent state at the end of World War I. Bronna G√≥ra was part of the Polesie Voivodeship, and remained there until the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.Echa Polesia 3 (39) 2013, Miejsca Pamiƒôci Narodowej, Obw√≥d Brzeski (Places of National Memory, Brest Oblast). Kresy24.pl ‚Äì Wschodnia Gazeta Codzienna (daily) 2014. With a railway stop at the edge of the woods, Bronna G√≥ra became the location of secluded massacres in 1942, with trainloads of Jews transported and dislodged there from the Ghetto in Brze≈õƒá, the Pi≈Ñsk Ghetto, and all other ghettos created by Nazi Germany in the area. Following the Soviet invasion of 1939, Bronna G√≥ra along with most of Polesie Voivodeship was annexed into the Soviet Belarus after the NKVD-staged elections decided in the atmosphere of terror. All citizens previously living but also born in Poland would live in the Byelorussian SSR from then on, as the Soviet subjects, not Polish. However, the Soviet rule was short-lived because the corresponding terms of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact signed earlier in Moscow were broken when the German army crossed the Soviet occupation zone on 22 June 1941. From 1941 to 1943 the province was under the control of Nazi Germany, govern by the collaborationist Belarusian Central Council supported by the Nazi Belarusian battalions of the Home Defence. Andrew Wilson, Belarus: The Last European Dictatorship, Yale University Press 2011. Page 109. Mass killings The first murder operation took place in June 1942, with 3,500 Jews transported from the Pi≈Ñsk Ghetto and nearby Kobry≈Ñ for \\"processing\\" (durchschleusen), at Bronna G√≥ra. According to postwar testimony of Benjamin Wulf, a Polish Jew from Antopol who managed to survive the massacre, the train stop was surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. The prisoners were informed by a translator that washing stations were in the woods behind. They were ordered to leave their outer garments by the train and take only the soap and towel. Those who did not have soap were told not to worry because it had been supplied. The path through the woods, surrounded by barbed wire, was heavily guarded. It became narrower, until the sounds of shooting made it clear what went on at the end of the trail. The Jews who attempted to escape by crossing the fence were shot on the wires. Further up, the path opened to an area with execution pits deep and long, dug under the gun by hundreds of local labourers. Explosive materials were used to speed up the digging process. The fresh new victims were brought into the trenches and were shot one by one over the bodies of others.Testimony of B. Wulf, Docket nr 301/2212, Archives of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, Bronna G√≥ra (Bronnaja Gora) webpage. Virtual Shtetl 2014 (ibidem, print ). Retrieved June 3, 2014. According to a witness interviewed by Yahad-In Unum, 52,000 people were killed in Bronna G√≥ra, including Jews and people who were believed to be linked to partisans. In March 1944, as the Soviet Red Army advanced, the Germans attempted to erase the evidence of the massacres. A special Sonderaktion 1005 was brought in from outside, consisting of 100 slave workers. For the next two weeks they exhumed mass graves and burned the bodies on pyres. When they were finished, trees were planted, and all of the prisoners were shot. After the war, at the 1945 Potsdam Conference, Poland's borders were redrawn and Bronna G√≥ra became part of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. A memorial was erected at the site commemorating the perished Jewish citizens of the Soviet Union.

He later extended this to include occasions whereby employees took work home and/or on holiday that they could not complete in paid working hours. Hesketh's research, which centred on well-being in the UK police service, sought to identify a lacuna in current thinking around absenteeism and presenteeism; of which there is a plethora of academic study and commentary. The aim of his studies was to highlight that the true extent of sickness absence may be masked by the practice of leaveism, and that there may be a hidden populace experiencing significant workload overload. Leaveism is the practice of: # employees using allocated time off such as annual leave entitlements, flexi hours banked, re-rostered rest days and so on, to take time off when they are in fact unwell; # employees using these leave entitlements to look after dependents, including children and/or elderly relatives; # employees taking work home that cannot be completed in normal working hours; # employees working while not at work, on leave or holiday to catch up. In a later paper Hesketh et al. explored the relationship of leaveism with aspects of work-life balance, or integration as he preferred to call it; and the extent to which the practice existed amongst senior police officers. In support, research carried out by Gerich (n=930) suggested that fear of job loss or downgrading and low perceived job gratification appeared to increase the likelihood of the first element of leaveism. Findings from a national survey of police officers in the UK carried out in 2016 (n= 16,841) for the Police Federation of England and Wales noted that 59% of respondents had used annual leave, flexi time or rest days to have time away from the workplace due to the state of their physical health, and 42% had done the same due to psychological health conditions. Furthermore, the same survey reported 50% of respondents conceded they had taken work home that could not have completed in normal working hours, and 40% had worked while on holiday or annual leave in order to catch up with outstanding work. On a 2017 study visit to the United States, Hesketh noted a further manifestation in respect of US police patrol officers taking vacation allocations to mask sickness. In some of these cases it was in order to negate complaints or criticisms of working additional duties or employment outside of their police department. A culture of long hours and relatively high wages drove officers to use their own vacation time if suffering ill health to continue on additional paid work that was not as emotionally taxing or physically demanding. Hesketh and Cooper are currently researching the second aspect of leaveism, associated with using time off such as annual leave, flexitime and other rest day allocations to look after dependents, including both children and elderly relatives; the so- called sandwich generation. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has highlighted this aspect as schools around the world close down in attempts to reduce the spread of the virus. Again, the consequences of this are that employees are vulnerable to workload overload, which may, over time, have major health implications to those individuals. This may also impact on workplace outcomes, such as lost productivity and/or reduced performance and efficiency. This work also looks at the implications for resilience, engagement and discretionary effort which is discussed in depth in Hesketh and Cooper's book Managing Health and Wellbeing in the Public Sector The CIPD and Simply Health, following research with over 1,000 HR professionals representing 4.6m employees in the UK, reported that 87% considered that technology affected people's ability to switch off out of work hours (element 4 of Leaveism), taking phone calls and answering emails were cited by way of example. Further, that 69% had observed Leaveism over the last 12 months. A link to the report, Health and Well-being at Work, can be found here. A report by Deloitte in Jan 2020, titled Mental health and employers - Refreshing the case for investment detailed a 'deep dive' into Leaveism. It modelled numerous studies conducted over recent years and highlighted the criticality of the phenomena in understanding employees workplace responses to stress and ill-health. The report concluded that younger employees were more susceptible to leaveism and, as such, required more support. The report also made recommendations about what organisations could practically do to reduce the associated risks of Leaveism behaviours. Steps such as setting clear boundaries between work and personal time, enabling policy-driven culture change and encouraging people to take their annual leave allocation to switch off and relax. Leaveism is also cited in the BBC publication aptly named,'The 101 people, ideas and things changing how we work today' published in July 2019. March 2020 saw a distinct change in Leaveism behaviours, with the impact of COVID-19 striking hard. Employees isolating and shielding largely ceased to use allocated time off when unwell, element 1 of the practice. Conversely, there appears to be an enormous rise in a version of elements 3 and 4, in that employees are working incredibly long hours on Zoom, Teams, FaceTime and Skype calls without a break. Many seeing their workloads rise exponentially. The National Forum for Health and Wellbeing noted the propensity for employees to conduct back to back online meetings without a break for very long hours throughout the working day and well beyond. The impact of which inhibits exercise and healthy living generally. They also witnessed employees effectively working from bed when they were unwell. Hesketh & Cooper are currently engaged on a study of these behaviours and will report late 2020.

Construction was completed in 1931.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"Willem Marinus Dudok\\", retrieved 21 January 2013 It is a much-admired building that is considered the finest example of Dudok‚Äôs work and internationally recognized as one of the most influential buildings of its time.  Planning stage  Dudok became Director of Public Works of Hilversum in 1915. Initially, he designed a traditional building intended to fit into the town‚Äôs downtown area. However, due to World War I and lack of funds this was not constructed. Dudok presented the first sketches for a new design in 1924, for which he was able to use an elevated location to the northwest of the town centre. This location, which did not constrain the building with composition or height restrictions, gave Dudok the freedom to express his considerable capabilities. It is surrounded by a park and the light-coloured building rises from water, highlighting the garden city character that Hilversum wanted to achieve.  The building  Somewhat reminiscent of the early designs of Frank Lloyd Wright, the Town Hall building consists of two squares; an inner courtyard surrounded by offices and a second courtyard surrounded by low spaces and traversed by a service road. This remarkable and in many ways unique structure was completed in 1931, by which time Dudok was Hilversum‚Äôs Municipal Architect, and was enthusiastically embraced by the people of Hilversum for its balance between form and function, fine workmanship and high quality finishes and materials used. Some critics, however, accused Dudok of diluting modernist designs and being halfway modernist, lacking a specific style. However, the end result is considered by many to be a testament to the consistent harmonic form, function, art and human need. Hilversum Town Hall is one of the most successful buildings in the history of the modernist movement.  Subsequent history  During World War II the building was used as headquarters of the German Wehrmacht, for which it was necessary to camouflage the prominent tower. The sound of its bell was broadcast live every hour on public radio stations until the 1960s, reflecting the town‚Äôs role as the principal media centre for the Netherlands. The building was restored between 1989 and 1995. Restoration costs caused some dispute, as it was for a time proposed to sell a painting by Mondrian, who came from nearby Amersfoort, to pay for the restoration.

The high school has been using that federal location as a school building since 2006 and has plans to expand. The GSA decided that it would be better to sell the building than continue to rent it to the school. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Amy Biehl High School is a charter high school (275 students, grades 9-12) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The school is now housed in the Old Post Office building in Downtown Albuquerque. The dual mission of the school revolves around service and scholarship, the creation of \\"conscious scholars.\\" The school is named after Amy Biehl, a young woman who was murdered in South Africa in 1993. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Albuquerque, New Mexico, Federal Land Conveyance Act of 2014 would direct the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to offer to convey to the Amy Biehl High School Foundation certain federal lands, including any improvements on such lands, located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The bill would require such conveyance to be in accordance with a fair market value appraisal that is acceptable to the Administrator. The bill would make the Foundation responsible for the costs related to such conveyance. The bill would require the proceeds from such conveyance to be paid into the Federal Buildings Fund. The bill would require the conveyance to occur within three years of this Act's enactment. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 13, 2014. This is a public domain source. The bill would direct the General Services Administration (GSA) to sell a federal property in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico, to the Amy Biehl High School Foundation for its fair market value. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting the legislation would increase offsetting receipts, a credit against direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. We estimate that the net offsetting receipts from the sale would be negligible. Enacting H.R. 3998 would not affect revenues. H.R. 3998 would authorize GSA to sell an historic post office and courthouse in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. The legislation would require the designated purchaser to cover any federal administrative costs associated with the sale. Proceeds from the sale‚Äîprobably about $50,000‚Äîwould be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund and would be available to GSA, subject to future appropriation. In addition, GSA currently receives about $1,200 a year under a 60-year lease to the foundation. By selling the property, the government would forgo those receipts in future years. H.R. 3998 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. On February 20, 2014, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for S. 898, the Albuquerque, New Mexico, Federal Land Exchange Conveyance Act of 2013, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Both bills contain similar provisions, and their estimated costs are the same. Procedural history The Albuquerque, New Mexico, Federal Land Conveyance Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 5, 2014 by Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D, NM-1). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management. The bill was reported (amended) by the Committee on Transportation on April 9, 2014 alongside House Report 113-408. The House was scheduled to vote on the bill under a suspension of the rules on June 17, 2014.

She is best known as the creator of the winning design for the common obverse of the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame commemorative coin program. __TOC__  Biography  Cassie McFarland grew up in the historic railroad town of Roseville. Her parents are Robert and Wendy McFarland. = Education = She attended California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA, earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts, Studio Art and Design degree in 2008.Alumni - Art and Design - Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo  Works and awards  Cassie McFarland works in the fields of figurative painting and photography.

While attending Cal Poly, she received the following awards: * Studio Arts Concentration Award, Annual Award for Junior Standing, Department of Art & Design * Cal Poly Arts Award * Studio Art Scholarship, Annual Award for Graduating Students, Department of Art & Design She has also used her art training to improve the mental and physical health of the elderly by assisting with the art therapy portion of a respite day program that specializes in multi-sensory activities, with an emphasis on developmental communication.Insights Based out of San Luis Obispo, Ms. McFarland maintains strong ties to the local arts communities. This includes working with a small group of other local San Luis Obispo artists as part of a professional collective called Yoke. The group seeks to make the visual and performing arts an even more active presence within their community. Yoke also facilitates collaboration between its members while helping to produce and exhibit each artist's work individually.  2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin  Final design of the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame commemorative coin.On September 4, 2013, the United States Department of the Treasury selected her design as the winning entry in the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame commemorative coin competition, which ran from April 11 to 11 May of that year.Baseball Coin Design Competition - United States Mint The contest was authorized by the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act (Public Law 112-152), signed into law by President Barack Obama on August 3, 2013.National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act (2012; 112th Congress H.R. 2527) - GovTrack.us All told, the Treasury Department received 178 original entries - including McFarland's, which she submitted on the last day of the contest (11 May) after having happened across the competition online while researching another art project involving Shell gas station tokens. Contest semi-finalists were chosen by three U.S. Mint sculptor-engravers and one banknote designer from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The four judges scored each entry according to artistic merit and suitability or adaptability to a coin format. 16 finalists were then selected based on scores given to the semi-finalist designs by a group of five members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, including Joe Morgan, Brooks Robinson, Ozzie Smith, Don Sutton, and Dave Winfield.Finalist Designs Selected for Baseball Coin Design Competition  Coin Update The finalists were then reviewed by the United States Commission of Fine Arts, the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Acting Director of the Mint Richard Peterson then culled together the preceding reviews and comments before making a final recommendation to Treasury Secretary Jacob \\"Jack\\" Lew. Due to the government shutdown of October 2013, there was no public unveiling ceremony.The Coin Analyst: Modern U.S. Coin News Update - CoinWeek  CoinWeek The Mint announced McFarland's design as the winner on its website on October 8, 2013 McFarland herself didn't find out until Coin World, an American numismatic and coin collecting magazine, contacted her for an interview.Commemorative Coins: Cassie McFarland‚Äôs Glove Design a Perfect Fit - CoinWeek  CoinWeek = Design = The \\"well-loved\\" glove that served as a model for Cassie McFarland's design.Cassie McFarland's winning design, entitled \\"A Hand Full of Gold\\", was modeled on a time-worn, \\"well-loved\\" baseball glove that had been in her family since she was a young girl. However, her initial design concept was \\"quirky\\" and \\"abstract\\". She briefly considered designing the coin to have the feel of a peanut shell due to peanuts being so strongly associated with ballparks and nostalgia for the game of baseball. McFarland soon decided against the idea out of deference to the feelings of people with peanut allergies, and eventually decided that she didn't want her final design to be \\"harsh and geometric\\". She then settled on the simple baseball glove as the main motif of her design due to its inherent Americana and nostalgic appeal. It also made effective aesthetic use of the concave shape of the coin's obverse. The 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame commemorative coin is the first scyphate coinage ever produced by the U.S. Mint, as authorized by Section 3(d) of the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act.Text of H.R. 2527 (112th): National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act (Passed Congress/Enrolled Bill version) - GovTrack.us Specifically, the law calls for a coin produced > \\"in a fashion similar to the 2009 International Year of Astronomy coins > issued by Monnaie de Paris, the French Mint, so that the reverse of the coin > is convex to more closely resemble a baseball and the obverse concave, > providing a more dramatic display of the obverse design chosen pursuant to > section 4(c).\\" A few drafts later, McFarland submitted her final design. It featured a wheat motif that curved around the bottom of the glove, from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger. She included the wheat not only as another nod to a nostalgic American past, but also as a reference to the Grange movement with which her family has been involved for so long. U.S. Mint Sculptor- Engraver Don Everhart - who also designed the common reverse for the Baseball Hall of Fame coin program - removed the wheat from the coin's production design, presumably in order to facilitate its reproduction on actual coins. Cassie McFarland received $5,000 for her winning design, and her initials appear on the obverse as well.United States Mint and Baseball Team Up to Create Commemorative Coin References External links San Luis Obispo County Arts Council website * San Luis Obispo Museum of Art website * National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum website * Text of Public Law 112-152 * 16 finalist designs for the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame commemorative coin People from Roseville, California 1985 births Living people American graphic designers Women graphic designers California Polytechnic State University alumni Artists from California ","title":"Cassie McFarland"},{"id":"42957022","text":"Hexoplon illuminum is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

The municipality existed from 1902 until its dissolution in 1964. It was located along the eastern and western shores of the √Ölfjorden, a small branch off the main Hardangerfjorden. The municipality is located in the present-day municipalities of Sveio (in Hordaland county) and in Vindafjord (in Rogaland county). The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Vikebygd, where Vikebygd Church is located. History Historically, the parish of Vikebygd was a part of the old municipality of Fjeldberg. In 1865, Vikebygd parish became a part of the new municipality of Sveen. On 1 January 1902, the eastern part of the municipality of Sveen was separated to form the new municipality of Vikebygd. Initially, Vikebygd had a population of 1,092. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Vikebygd was dissolved. Using √Ölfjorden as a dividing line the western part of Vikebygd (population: 471) was merged into the neighboring municipality of Sveio and the eastern part (population: 578) was merged into the neighboring municipality of √òlen. On 1 January 2006, all of √òlen municipality was incorporated into Vindafjord municipality in Rogaland county. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Vikebygd was made up of 17 representatives who were elected to four year terms.

Popa; May 1, 1892 - July 18, 1948) was a Romanian physician and public intellectual. Of lowly peasant origin, he managed to obtain a university education and become a professor at two of his country's leading universities. An anatomist by specialty, Popa worked on popularizing modern science, reforming the medical and higher education systems, and, in war hospitals, as a decorated and publicly acclaimed practitioner. His work in endocrinology and neuromorphology was valued abroad, while at home he helped train a generation of leading doctors. Ill-treated by successive fascist dictatorships, Popa adhered to moderate left-wing ideals and publicized them by means of his review, √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene. He criticized Marxism as much as scientific racism, but condemned Romania's participation in the war against the Soviets, and, in 1944, joined a protest movement of high-profile academics. During his final years, his anticommunism and his Christian democratic stances brought him into conflict with the authorities. The Communist Romanian regime drove him out of his teaching position and harassed him until his death in middle age. Upon the restoration of democracy, his alma mater and the school where he taught for much of his career was named in his honor. Biography =Origins and early career= Born in »òurƒÉne»ôti, Vaslui County, his parents Maria and Toader were poor rƒÉze»ôi, peasants who owned their own plot of land.Petrovanu, p.19 The family was related to Emil Condurachi, future historian and archeologist.NastasƒÉ (2007), p.160 Grigore, the couple's eleventh child, Dumitru Radu Popa, \\"Liber sub dictaturƒÉ: Gr. T. Popa\\", Via≈£a Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 5-6/2010 was intellectually precocious. His mother noticed his aptitude early on, and despite great material difficulties, including selling off their land so he could finish high school, his parents managed to provide him with an education. As argued by historian Lucian Boia, Popa's lowly origin and his successful career stand as evidence of an \\"upward social mobility\\" in the pre-1944 Kingdom of Romania.Boia, p.341 Raised a Romanian Orthodox, Popa blended his belief in core Christian principles with an interest in science.Stanomir, pp.40-41 At the age of fifteen, he translated Ernst Haeckel's General Morphology into Romanian and obtained the author's written permission to publish. He would later translate Gray's Anatomy as well. Richard Constantinescu, \\"Dr. Florica CernƒÉtescu-Popa\\", Via»õa MedicalƒÉ, Nr. 38/2011 Popa graduated from the National College in Ia»ôi and entered the Natural Sciences faculty of the local university. However, as his parents had no more money for his schooling and there were no scholarships left, he switched to the Medical faculty, where there was one scholarship, even though the field did not attract him. Upon seeing cadavers being dissected for the first time, he fainted and had to be revived with cold water by an assistant. However, he persevered in his studies and was helped in particular by two professors, Nicolae Hortolomei and Francisc Rainer, becoming the latter's assistant after graduation. As later noted by surgeon Ilie Th. Riga, who was his colleague on Rainer's team, \\"we lived for years in the most select atmosphere that education may breed\\": \\"It is to [Rainer] that we owe our character, the awakening of our scientific interest\\".Riga et al., p.180 During World War I, Popa cared for the wounded and sick at Ia»ôi's Sf√¢ntul Spiridon Hospital, earning him a knighthood in the Order of the Crown. In May 1918, following Romania's withdrawal from war, Popa applied to rejoin Rainer's team in Bucharest, where Rainer was performing experimental surgery on wounded soldiers.Riga et al., p.69-70 Popa's student card photograph, ca. 1910 In July of that year, he married Florica CernƒÉtescu, a university classmate. A native of Hu»ôi, her maternal grandfather was the chemist Petru Poni. Also trained by RainerRiga et al., pp.70, 180 and herself a decorated wartime physician, she went on to become associate professor of Histology and his closest scientific collaborator over the years. The couple had two sons and two daughters.Petrescu, p.372 Popa eventually followed Rainer to the University of Bucharest's medical faculty in 1920, and was appointed assistant professor. With Rainer as his doctoral advisor, Popa completed his docent degree, describing the functional structure of the dura mater.Riga et al., pp.382, 383, 384 Over the course of his career, his students included some twenty-two university professors and Romanian Academy members, among them George Emil PaladePetrovanu, p.23 \\"RecuperƒÉri.

Popa (I)\\", Cultura, Nr. 396, November 2012 =Rise to prominence= By January 1924, when Rainer's alleged Jewish extraction made him a target of antisemitic agitation among the students, Popa became Rainer's voice in professional disputes. As such, he accused a Ia»ôi anatomist, Victor Papilian, of plagiarism, and published his take on the matter in the Bucharest daily AdevƒÉrul.Constantinescu, \\"Grigore T. Popa »ôi Victor Papilian...\\", passim Papilian retorted with accusations of sectarianism against Popa, Rainer, and the whole \\"Bucharest school\\": \\"a sterile and envious school\\", \\"a grand society of mutual admirers, wherein master and students have declared each other geniuses\\".Constantinescu, \\"Grigore T. Popa »ôi Victor Papilian...\\", p.39 Popa identified Ia»ôi with extreme nationalism, and, in a 1925 article for the student review Via»õa UniversitarƒÉ, accused the far-right National-Christian Defense League of hypocrisy. As he noted, its \\"hatred and brutality\\" were not just aimed at Jews, but also at Romanians coming in from Bessarabia, since the latter were ostensibly socialists.Irina Livezeanu, Cultural Politics in Greater Romania. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 2000, , p.258 With Rainer's help,Riga et al., pp.70, 383 Popa received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship in 1925. He had a direct experience of America, and of what he liked to call its \\"guided democracy\\", Constantin Coroiu, \\"Un erou intelectual: Gr. T. Popa (II)\\", Cultura, Nr. 397, November 2012 which was rare among Romanians of his generation, and which he recorded in detail in diaries he intended for publishing. He spent the first year in Chicago, the second at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole and finishing by studying Anatomy and Embryology in 1927‚Äì1928 at University College Hospital Medical School, under Grafton Elliot Smith. His scientific activity, after his work on the dura mater, focused on three areas: the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis, the reform of medical education at the university level,Petrovanu, p.21 and the physiology of spontaneous movement (motility) in spermatozoa. Grigore T. Popa, \\"Sur la motilit√© des spermatozo√Ødes chez quelques vert√©br√©s sup√©rieurs (taureau, b√©lier, homme)\\", in Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s√©ances de la Soci√©t√© de biologie et de ses filiales, Vol. 100, Masson et Cie., Paris, 1929, pp.45-46 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) Regarding the first area, he worked in London alongside the Australian Una Fielding; together they discovered the vascular link between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, publishing their findings on the hypophyseal portal system in medical journals between 1930 and 1935, presenting them before the Royal Medical Society in 1935.Sally O'Neill, \\"Fielding, Una Lucy (1888‚Äì1969)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, 1996; Petrovanu, p.21; Popa (1945), pp.230-231 Working alongside his Romanian colleague, Eugen Lucinescu, Popa also returned to anatomy with a study on the \\"mechanostructure\\" of the pericardium.Gregor T. Popa, Eug. Lucinescu, \\"The Mechanostructure of the Pericardium\\", Journal of Anatomy, 67 (Pt. 1), October 1932, p.78-107 (digitized by the United States National Library of Medicine) In 1928, Popa became professor of anatomy at Ia»ôi,Petrovanu, p.20 the city associated with his rivals. For many years he taught Histology, Anatomical Pathology and Legal Medicine, as required,Petrovanu, p.22 and was also curator of Sf√¢ntul Spiridon Hospital, as well as head of the Physicians and Naturalists' Society. His confrontation with the city's antisemitic far-right became direct. In late 1929, he presided over a commission tasked with investigating the race riot at Ia»ôi medical faculty. He found that the Jewish and Romanian students were racially segregated during teaching hours, which contributed to the tensions, but could not identify students directly responsible for the incident.Lucian NastasƒÉ, Antisemitismul universitar √Æn Rom√¢nia (1919-1939). Editura Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor MinoritƒÉ≈£ilor Na≈£ionale, Cluj-Napoca, 2011, , pp.427-429 With time, Popa became a noted public speaker in support of modernization, and a popularizer of Western science. In 1931, he gave a public lecture on \\"The Former and Current Situation of Ia»ôi\\", which recognized that the city had greatly decayed, materially and culturally, since 1866. He attributed this decline to psychological factors (a city with \\"depressed\\", \\"disinterested\\" and \\"filthy\\" inhabitants), but also to clientelism and the excessive powers of the central government.NastasƒÉ (2007), pp.292-293 On Washington's Birthday, 1932, he discussed \\"The Scientific Spirit in America and in Europe\\" at the Friends of America society in Bucharest.\\"Rumania\\", in History of the George Washington Bicentennial Celebration.

Popa was Dean of the Ia»ôi medical faculty for two years, from 1938 to 1940. At around that time, he drifted apart from his mentor Rainer, and relations between them became \\"tense\\".BƒÉlƒÉceanu-Stolnici, p.18; G. BrƒÉtescu, Ce-a fost sƒÉ fie. Nota»õii autobiografice. Humanitas, Bucharest, 2003, , p.105 According to a popular account that Popa repeatedly challenged, Rainer had claimed the discovery of the hypophyseal portal system some years before Popa and Fielding.Popa (1945), passim; Riga et al., pp.138, 383-384 =Antifascism= In January 1936, together with writers Mihail Sadoveanu, George Top√Ærceanu and Mihai Codreanu, Popa founded √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene (\\"Recordings from Ia»ôi\\"), a magazine of commentary. With his intercession, the original group grew to include other intellectuals, including philosopher Ion Petrovici Peregrinus, \\"Edituri ie»ôene, autori ie»ôeni\\", Convorbiri Literare, May 2009 and physician-novelist I. I. Mironescu. Constantin Coroiu, \\"Un erou intelectual: Gr. T. Popa (III)\\", Cultura, Nr. 398, November 2012 He also used the magazine to popularize the anthropological work of his former teacher, Elliott Smith.Petru Comarnescu, \\"O incalculabil de importantƒÉ teorie asupra originii statuei-portret »ôi a altor arte\\", Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 8/1944, p.468 √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene ran for four years, coinciding with the peak of political turmoil. It borrowed inspiration from Via≈£a Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Romania's classical tribune of social criticism, with Popa joining in the trend. As argued in 2012 by author Constantin Coroiu, Popa expanded the magazine's focus beyond cultural matters: \\"He takes up issues, analyses and criticizes mindsets, mores, inertia, cowardice, grave failures of character, and, what's more, the scourges of Romanian, and even European, society in his own day and ever since.\\" At √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene, which, under Top√Ærceanu's guidance, made efforts to preserve its political independence, Popa took a firm stand against the violently fascist Iron Guard, and denounced scientific racism.DrƒÉgƒÉnescu, p.6 As noted by Boia, Popa took \\"moderately left-wing positions and [was] persistent in his defense of democracy.\\"Boia, p.185 According to his student BƒÉlƒÉceanu-Stolnici, he had \\"a left-wing orientation of the British Labourite kind\\". Citing the need for intellectual freedom, he publicly defended Sadoveanu, who was being attacked by his far-right colleagues, with pieces in the left-leaning newspaper Diminea»õa.Boia, pp.78-79 Although active in such civil society causes, he was never a member of a political party, and also administered criticism to the establishment National Peasants' Party. In his articles for √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene, he accuses the National Peasantists of corruption and politicking. Popa criticized the breakdown of Romanian democracy and the creation of a National Renaissance Front (FRN) dictatorship in 1938, describing it as \\"unprecedented lunacy or the actual perversion of leadership\\".Stanomir, p.37 He decried the new authoritarian Constitution as an act of capitulation to \\"political militancy and cultural inferiority\\", even as his colleagues in the literary world had come to endorse it. That year, in an obituary piece for the socialist physician Ioan Cantacuzino, Popa outlined his own humanist vision of science as a \\"sacred fire\\". In his view, material civilization had evolved faster than culture, unwittingly instigating a sort of \\"pseudo-culture\\" that opposed progress.Al. Mironescu, \\"Cronici. √én memoria doctorului Cantacuzino\\", Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 3/1938, pp.692-693 He combined Herbert Spencer's take on sociocultural evolution with a measure of genetic determinism, and, against psychological nativism, suggested that all concept of morality was produced by and through evolution; he also held that primitive society, and \\"semi-civilized\\" fascism, were regulated by the brainstem, whereas civilization was a realm of the cerebral cortex.DrƒÉgƒÉnescu, pp.2‚Äì7, 8‚Äì9 When, in 1940, Popa contributed to the FRN regime's magazine, MuncƒÉ »ôi Voe BunƒÉ, it was to highlight its contribution to working class welfare.\\"Revista revistelor. Toate suferin»õele muncitore»ôti »ôi-au regƒÉsit ecou √Æn inima Regelui\\", Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 7/1940, p.217 Popa witnessed subsequent developments from the side. The National Renaissance Front fell from power after agreeing to territorial losses in favor of Hungary and the Soviet Union. He was part of the Grand Caucus of the University, which issued a reserved protest against the cession of Northern Transylvania.Valeriu Florin Dobrinescu, \\"Contribu»õii la cunoa»ôterea situa»õiei studen»õilor ie»ôeni √Æn perioada 1 septembrie 1939‚Äî6 septembrie 1940\\", Carpica. Publica»õia Muzeului de Istorie »ôi ArtƒÉ BacƒÉu, Vol. VI, 1973‚Äì1974, p.203 With a special issue and articles in √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene, Popa also mourned the loss of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.\\"Revista revistelor. √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene se dedicƒÉ Basarabiei »ôi Bucovinei\\", Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 10/1940, pp.224-225 Harassed by the Iron Guard, which blacklisted him for assassination,Iacob, p.265; Petrovanu, p.22 Popa managed to survive its \\"National Legionary State\\" regime, proclaimed in September 1940. However, √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene was banned, with some of its staff members moved to the fascist-inspired Cetatea Moldovei review.Boia, pp.244, 256 A Ia»ôi medical faculty purging commission, headed by Iron Guard men, proposed Popa's transfer \\"to another scientific institution\\", citing Popa's \\"left-wing ideas\\" as a rationale. Under the more lenient fascist dictatorship of Ion Antonescu, Popa continued to speak his mind, in particular objecting to Romania's participation in World War II alongside Nazi Germany. He was, as Boia notes, \\"an intransigent antifascist, [who] would naturally fit into any sort of plot against the regime\\".Boia, p.237 In 1942, following Rainer's retirement, he was transferred to Bucharest, where he worked as a professor for four years.Petrovanu, pp.22-23 After Rainer's death in 1944, he also took over the Anthropological Institute and reattached it to the medical school.BƒÉlƒÉceanu-Stolnici, p.15 While there, Popa wrote a study showing the lack of any scientific basis for Aryanism and asserting that there was no reason to oppress Jews. Traian SƒÉvulescu, afraid to offend Antonescu, refused to publish it; Popa nevertheless read the work before the Academy in late 1943. The listeners, few of whom were pro-German, reacted positively. However, a January 1944 address was seen as a veiled attack on the dictator, to whom the members were largely sympathetic, and as a result drew a chillier reaction. One of his conferences at the Academy, Reforma Spiritului. »òtiin»õa ca bazƒÉ de primenire a omului (\\"Spiritual Reform. Science as a Basis for Bettering Mankind\\") objected to Romania's economic dependency, claiming that Romanians were at risk of falling back among \\"agricultural peoples\\", those \\"destined to perpetual ignorance\\".Petru Comarnescu, \\"TipƒÉriturile »òcoalei Sociologice dela Bucure»ôti (II)\\", Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 8/1944, pp.422-423 By that time, the security service, Siguran»õa Statului, was keeping Popa under constant surveillance.Boia, pp.236-237 In April 1944, together with other prominent intellectuals, Popa signed a petition asking Antonescu to seek peace with the Allies and end the war immediately.Boia, p.235; Iacob, p.265; Petroveanu, pp.235-237 As noted by Boia, this \\"academics' memorandum\\" was belated, and did not expose its signers to any special persecution, since the Red Army was already poised to invade Romania.Boia, p.235 Its paternity was for long disputed between the semi-active National Peasants' Party, who relied on Popa's friendliness, and the repressed Romanian Communist Party. According to the National Peasantist version of the events, the text had been drafted as early as 1943 by Popa and Ioan Hudi»õƒÉ, and only presented to the communists for signing.Boia, pp.235-236 Solomon Marcus, \\"Halucinantul an 1944\\" , Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 45/2004 Nevertheless, both versions agree that Popa had a fundamental role in the secret negotiations between centrists and communists. =Anticommunism= King Michael I, Premier Nicolae RƒÉdescu, and Social Democratic leader Constantin Titel Petrescu listening to a speech delivered by the Bucharest University Rector, Simion Stoilow, at the 1945 opening ceremony. Popa is front row, farthest right Popa gave a cautious welcome to the August 1944 Coup which toppled Antonescu, describing it as Romania's \\"return to normality.\\" Reputedly, he was appointed Minister of Education in one of the cabinet variants shuffled after the coup, but deposed within 15 minutes of his appointment by Soviet representatives. From 1944 to 1946,Boia, p.257 he was Dean of the Bucharest medical faculty, having been handpicked for the position by »òtefan Voitec, the Social Democrat Education Minister.Iacob, p.265 With the onset of the Soviet occupation and the installation of a Communist Party-led government, he continued to stand up for his principles. In front of communist-run purging committees, he defended on professional grounds those colleagues accused of having sided with fascism, and called for the reinstatement of academic freedom.Boia, p.256-258; Iacob, pp.264-266 In January 1945, Democra»õia, a liberal democratic daily, published Ion Biberi's interview with Popa, where the latter voices the opinion that a truly democratic regime \\"cannot be tolerant of any form of extremism\\".\\"Lumea de m√¢ine vƒÉzutƒÉ de d-nii D.

See also Iacob, p.269 As noted in 2009 by historian Bogdan Cristian Iacob, Popa's stance showed \\"a glaring lack of sense for the times\\", \\"an incapacity to grasp that the Academy and University were not, at least initially, attacked on the basis of the scholarship produced, but from political positions.\\" According to Iacob, Popa was callous in not showing a willingness to indict those of his medical school colleagues who had careers in the Iron Guard.Iacob, p.264-265 Following his clash with Parhon, Popa took the even more drastic step of resigning from the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union.Iacob, p.266; Petrescu, p.370 Also in 1945, he began aiding Constant Tonegaru's \\"Mihai Eminescu Society\\", a secret opposition group that distributed appeals for help to the West. He used his dean's cabinet as storage room for such anticommunist propaganda. Alex. »òtefƒÉnescu, Cicerone Ioni»õoiu, \\"Constant Tonegaru - de»õinut politic\\" , Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 3/2002 During this period, he was attacked and robbed by a group of three Soviet soldiers, which he interpreted as a warning. Popa signed his name to a public protest decrying vote-rigging during the November 1946 election; there were ten other signatories, including aviatrix Smaranda BrƒÉescu and Army General Aurel Aldea. It reached the Allied Commission, and, after being examined by Soviet representatives, served as incriminating evidence for the protesters' repression.Valeriu Avram, \\"Smaranda BrƒÉescu ‚Äì o pasƒÉre √Æm vƒÉzduh\\", in Magazin Istoric, May 2001, p.62 Popa's final public appearance took the form of a speech before the Academy in April 1947. From an unassuming title, which implied a lecture about \\"nervous tension and the century's disease\\", it turned abruptly to political critique, likening the abuses of Nazism to those of communism. Popa's concept of \\"nervous tension\\", theorized by Popa from texts by Guglielmo Ferrero, was in fact the collective fear imposed by totalitarianism, which leads man to \\"hide the reservations imposed by his consciousness.\\"Stanomir, pp.37-38 Terror was inevitable, but ultimately inefficient: > dictators [...] shall always be powerlessly arrested on the edge of our > meditative nervous network, which they cannot control and cannot deform. > There, in his own cortex, man still endures free [...]. But if, in order to > make sure that they have expunged it, dictators should crucify [their > victims], then the spirit, with its invisible vibrations, shall make its way > from the crucified to the still-chained, and the miracle of a new > resurrection will become possible, the resurrection of freedom, without > which humanity would become extinct.Stanomir, pp.39-40 Popa returned to his ideas on \\"semi-civilization\\", describing revolution as an enemy of natural selection, in either its Darwinian or Lamarckism (Popa favored neither of the latter theories, viewing them as compatible).DrƒÉgƒÉnescu, pp.3-4 With \\"racism\\", \\"historical materialism\\" was \\"a dangerous simplification\\" of human endeavor.DrƒÉgƒÉnescu, p.4 He warned that communism, like Nazism, was going to \\"exterminate, propagating hatred and violence toward any belief but its own.\\"Stanomir, pp.38-39 His was also an appeal against immoral but \\"exact\\" science, describing ideologues as \\"disciples of the Antichrist\\": \\"In this grave situation, the time has come for any conscience that is still pure to ask themselves: 'Where to?' And the answer will not be hard to find: 'Back to Christian morality!'\\".Stanomir, p.41 According to political scientist Ioan Stanomir, this sample of \\"Christian democracy\\" managed to reconcile the political expression of Romanian Orthodoxy, previously monopolized by the far-right, with \\"political freedom, understood as a set of guarantees against ideological and administrative arbitrariness.\\" =Communist persecution and death= According to Popa's own recollection, the audience sat stone-faced through the delivery of Popa's speech, and rushed for the exits once it was over. More optimistically, Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru, a fellow anticommunist academician, wrote that those making an \\"ostentatious\\" exit were friends of the Soviet regime, such as Sadoveanu and Parhon. The core public cheered, as if \\"the Academy were infused with revolt and [...] no one takes for granted the existence of Russian democracy‚Äîthat blend of dictatorship and gangsterism.\\" Codrin Liviu Cu»õitaru, \\"Istoriografia rom√¢neascƒÉ »ôi dictatura\\", Observator Cultural, Nr. 58, April 2001 As argued by Stanomir, Popa \\"spoke out inadmissible truths and gave value appraisals to a regime that was just getting ready to impose Stalinist orthodoxy upon the intellectuals. [...] The coming world had discovered a witness that would not hesitate to diagnose it.\\" Within days, Popa was asked to attend a meeting with the Communist Interior Minister, Teohari Georgescu, but he casually refused. When the Gendarmes were dispatched to arrest him at his residence on the university campus, hundreds of students formed a chain and blocked their entrance. His oppositional stance led to his removal from the Academy with the enthusiastic approval of fellow scientists SƒÉvulescu and Parhon,Petrescu, p.371 from the deanship and, in 1946, from teaching.Boia, pp.257-258; Iacob, p.268; Petrovanu, p.23 This was accomplished with a novel procedure, which formally eliminated (\\"compressed\\") the teaching position, but also singled out the person in charge for further inquiry.Iacob, p.268 One individual who fought to force Popa out of teaching was Simion Oeriu, a communist without scientific training who was nonetheless appointed professor against Popa's objections. Another means used to target him was a proposal to admit hundreds of students who had been victims of Nazi oppression in Northern Transylvania, some of whom spoke no Romanian, and award them doctorates in two or three years. When Popa refused, he was called a \\"reactionary\\" and even an Iron Guard sympathizer. A first attempt to fire him met with resistance from the medical students, who were very fond of their teacher. When he was ultimately dismissed, he remained unemployed; his lifelong friend Sadoveanu did not intervene. Although seriously ill with essential hypertension and renal sclerosis, he was unable to enter a hospital. Abandoned by his colleagues and under pressure from the authorities, he withdrew into semi- clandestinity. He and his elder son fled in peasant clothes to »òurƒÉne»ôti, then to the home of friends in Baia Mare. By constantly changing addresses and not venturing out into the street, Popa managed to evade arrest and was finally brought home, moribund, at the beginning of July 1948. The authorities were aware of his presence but no longer bothered to detain him. His death soon afterwards came several months after a Communist regime was fully established; the Bucharest university leadership refused to have his coffin publicly displayed. The new dean, Nicolae Gh. Lupu, ordered his family to leave campus. Over the course of the communist period, there was a concerted effort to banish Popa's memory, even though his 1944 petition to Antonescu was still being officially cited as evidence of a communist-backed resistance movement to fascism. In 1991, following the Romanian Revolution, the Ia»ôi medical institute, which had meanwhile been separated from the main university, was renamed the Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy. Universitatea de Medicin«é »ôi Farmacie \\"Grigore T. Popa\\" at the Ia»ôi City Hall site The primary school in his native village was also renamed in his honor in 2011. Ion Mitican, \\"Universitatea de MedicinƒÉ Gr. T.

Other essays were collected by physician Richard Constantinescu in a 2008 volume of works by and about Ion Petrovici. This is one of several monographs and anthologies edited by Constantinescu, detailing such topics as Popa's Christian faith and his correspondence with poet-physician VintilƒÉ Cioc√¢lteu, and including his American diary (published 2014). Popa's widow was obligated to live in a tiny apartment on the outskirts of Bucharest; she died in 1986, in her mid-90s. One of the couple's sons, Grigore Gr., himself became a doctor, while the other, Tudorel, was an actor. As youngsters, Tudorel Popa and his sister Marilena were both involved with their father in aiding the anticommunist underground. Tudorel Popa's son, Vlad Tudor Popa, is a chemist, head of the Romanian Academy's Institute of Physical Chemistry. Grigore Gr. died in 2006; his son is the novelist and critic Dumitru Radu Popa.

Following the Anglo-Dutch naval victory over the French and Spanish in the 1702 Battle of Vigo Bay, part of Glasshouse Street was renamed Vigo Lane. Later it became Vigo Street, but the name \\"Vigo Lane\\" was still used in Elmes's London Streets as late as 1831.

Together they published the infamous literary journal The Yellow Book volumes one and two in 1894. Later they founded The Bodley Head and continued to publish the work until it ceased in 1897. When the partnership between Lane and Mathews ended, both continued to have premises in Vigo Street and Mathews published the first editions of a number of important literary works, including The Wind Among the Reeds by W.B.

At first a moderate supporter of the revolution, he moved towards a monarchical position and worked to overthrow the Directory. When the Directory seized power, he was arrested and deported to Cayenne. He escaped, but died in Dutch Guiana soon after. Early years Fran√ßois Aubry was born in Paris on 12 December 1747. He joined the army, and in 1789 was a captain of artillery. He declared his support for the ideas of the revolution. He was appointed mayor of N√Æmes in 1790. Girondin member On 6 September 1792 he was elected a member of the National Convention for the department of Gard. Aubry was dispatched on a mission to the south of France. At the siege of Toulon he fell out with Napoleon Bonaparte, since he disagreed with his plan of attack. On returning to the convention, he attended the trial of King Louis XVI of France. He declared that Louis was guilty of conspiracy against freedom and attacks against the general security of the State, and voted in favor of the death penalty. On 3 August 1793 Aubry decreed that in all towns all the bells except one would be available to the Minister of War. Aubry signed a protest against the Insurrection of 31 May ‚Äì 2 June 1793, and was arrested and detained until 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794). Later career After 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794), Aubry returned to the Convention and succeeded Carnot in the Committee of Public Safety for military affairs. In this position he dismissed many officers accused of terrorism, including Massena and Bonaparte. He took a very active part in suppressing the revolt of 1 Prairial Year III (20 May 1795). Accused on that basis at the meeting of 14 Thermidor Year III (1 August 1795), he left the Committee and allied himself closely with the Clichy monarchical club, where he dominated the counter- revolutionary movement and became the most influential member. Aubry was among the members of the Convention who entered the Council of Five Hundred on 23 Vend√©miaire year IV (15 October 1795). An arrest warrant was issued against him for his unconstitutional attitude on 13 Vend√©miaire (5 October 1795), but was not executed. He supported Armand-Gaston Camus's proposed general amnesty. He opposed the law which declared nobles and relatives of emigrants ineligible for public office, and actively worked to overthrow the Directory. After the coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797) he was arrested and transported to Rochefort, from where he was shipped to Cayenne. He escaped from Cayenne in a small boat with Jean-Charles Pichegru and others, and landed in Demerara, Dutch Guiana. He died there soon after on 17 July 1798.

It was preceded by the 1904 election and followed by the 1910 election. Overview of the result As in most parts of Wales, the Liberal Party again won a majority of the seats. The Conservatives made a slight advance, notably in the western part of the county where they also held on in a number of industrial wards where the influence of paternalism remained strong. A more striking factor was the advance of Labour candidates in several areas and there were also Liberal members who were returned under a 'progressive' banner with support from the labour movement. Boundary changes There were no boundary changes at this election. Retiring aldermen All eleven retiring aldermen were Liberals, or Lib-Lab members as the Conservatives and their allies had been denied any seats on the aldermanic bench since the 1901 election. Contested elections There were fewer contested elections than three years before. =Aberdare, Mountain Ash and Merthyr districts= There were only two contested elections in the Aberdare district, and both were more personal than political. It was noted that the labour movement did not show the same interest in county elections than in those for the district council. =Bridgend and Maesteg districts= There were only two contested elections in this area and in one of those, a candidate had withdrawn too late in the day and polled very few votes. The contest in Maesteg was a particularly lively one and was influenced by the political struggles in Mid Glamorgan where Vernon Hartshorn was an increasingly influential figure. Hartshorn instigated the candidacy of the local federation solicitor who defeated a candidate closely allied to the coalowners. =Swansea, Pontardawe and Port Talbot districts= In these areas the Conservatives performed well, mainly at the expense of the Liberals and also holding off Labour challenges in Pontardawe and Loughor. Labour took Cwmavon from the Liberals by a substantial majority. Results =Aberaman= =Aberavon= J.M. Smith held on to the seat he had held since 1889 by a far more comfortable majority than three years previously. His opponent, a Liberal in 1904, now stood as a Labour candidate. The result was greeted by what was said to be the liveliest crowd seen in Aberavon for many years. =Aberdare Town= David Hughes, first elected in 1901 when he ousted David Price Davies, and re-elected in 1904 at a by-election following John William Evans's re-election as alderman, was again returned. =Barry= J.C. Meggitt stood down after fifteen years. =Blaengwawr= John Howell, first elected in 1895, was returned unopposed after G.A.Treharne withdrew. =Cadoxton= This was a contest in which the controversy over the education rate featured and the sitting member, a Roman Catholic, was defeated by the clerk of the former School Board. =Bridgend= Randall was returned unopposed. =Briton Ferry= Jenkin Hill recaptured the seat he lost three years previously. =Caeharris= =Caerphilly= =Cilfynydd= =Coedffranc= =Coity= On completion of his aldermanic term, William Howell was again returned. =Cowbridge= The sitting member, a timber merchant at Pendoylan, who had captured the seat three years previously, was now returned unopposed. =Cwmavon= =Cyfarthfa= =Cymmer= =Dinas Powys= =Dowlais= =Dulais Valley= =Ferndale= =Gadlys= Griffith George was opposed by Charles Vicary who described himself as a 'progressive' and a trade union candidate. Vicary claimed that there were no differences between him and George on a number of issues and denied George's claims that the contest was a sectarian one owing to Vicary being a churchman.

E. Morgan, miners' agent in the Western District of the South Wales Miners' Federation and a well known labour leader. Llewelyn, in view of his status as a landowner and employer, attracted widespread support and favourable reports of his public meetings appeared in the Cambrian newspaper. At the election, Llewelyn was said to have majority support in Gorseinon and Gowerton, although Tirdeunaw was said to favour Llewelyn. After his defeat, Morgan stated that as a working man he had only been campaigning for a week. =Maesteg= This was a fierce contest between Evan Davies, solicitor to the local miners' union and described by opponents as the Federation candidate and J.P. Gibbon, chairman of Maesteg Urban District Council and a local mineral agent. Davies responded to attacks by describing Gibbon as the candidate of North's Navigation collieries who had not been adopted by any public meeting or organisation Vernon Hartshorn played a prominent role in Davies's campaign and even brought Adela Pankhurst to address his final meeting, something which was not welcomed universally. =Margam= The Liberal candidate, who captured the seat three years previously, narrowly held on. The Conservatives had been confident of victory and the result was said to have been witnessed by one of the largest crowds seen in Port Talbot for many years. =Merthyr Town= =Merthyr Vale= =Morriston= =Mountain Ash= =Neath (North)= =Neath (South)= At the previous election, Trick had stood as a Conservative. =Newcastle= John Thomas switched to Newcastle. =Ogmore= The sitting member, a timber merchant of Porthcawl, was returned unopposed after the former member, J.D.

Centered on the intersection of North Leverett Road with Dudleyville Road, Church Hill Road, and Rattlesnake Gutter Road, it includes 15 houses and several other buildings, mainly from the village's mid-19th century peak as a modest rural village center. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history Moore's Corner is located in northeastern Leverett, a rural community in eastern Franklin County. The village is centered at North Leverett and Dudleyville Roads, but has widely spaced buildings beyond a small central core, extending along those two roads, as well as Rattlesnake Gutter Road and Church Hill Road. It includes predominantly residential buildings that were built during the height of the area's industrial activity between the 1840s and 1860s. The architecture is mainly Federal and Greek Revival in style, although the Moore's Corner Church, built in 1896, is Queen Anne in style. One of the most distinctive houses is that of Jonah Hunt at 8 Dudleyville Road, which is Leverett's only temple- front Greek Revival house. The district also includes historical archaeological remnants, including a former mill site on the Sawmill River, and a house foundation. Leverett was part of a large area that was originally part of Sunderland, settled in the 17th century. Sunderland's border was extended eastward in 1729, and then its eastern section was separated as Leverett in 1774. Moore's Corner was settled in the 1790s by Asa Moore, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, who established a sawmill in this area soon afterward. Moore's c. 1790 house, located at 197 North Leverett Road, is the oldest house in the district. A mill erected by Asa's brother Alven in 1793 survives on Dudleytown Road. In 1810, the growing village built a brick schoolhouse (230 North Leverett Road), which also served as a meeting house for the local Universalist congregation. The village cemetery, on Rattlesnake Gutter Road, was established about the same time, on land given by Asa Moore. More woodworking mills were built in the mid-19th century, including one that manufactured wooden shingles; the buildings have not survived, but its foundations remain on the banks of the Sawmill River.

After mass protests in the capital Sukhumi and the occupation of his office on 27 May, Ankvab fled to his hometown of Gudauta and ultimately resigned on 1 June, after previously denouncing the demonstration as an attempted coup d'√©tat. The uprising was attributed to public anger with Ankvab over his perceived liberal policy toward ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia, a breakaway republic with limited recognition. Although Abkhazia seceded from Georgia in 1992, the Ankvab administration allowed ethnic Georgians to register as voters and receive Abkhazian passports. The revolution led to an early presidential election being called in August 2014. Opposition leader Raul Khajimba was elected president with a narrow majority of the vote. Background In May 2011, Sergei Bagapsh died in office, leading to the 2011 presidential election. Alexander Ankvab won with 54.9% of the votes. In late April 2014, the opposition submitted a 5 May ultimatum to President Ankvab to dismiss the government and make radical reforms. Timeline until Alexander Ankvab's resignationMay 27: In the centre of Sukhumi 10,000 supporters of the Abkhaz opposition gathered. On the same day, President Aleksandr Ankvab's headquarters in Sukhumi were stormed by opposition groups led by Raul Khadjimba, forcing him into flight to Gudauta. The opposition claimed that the protests were sparked by poverty, but the main point of contention was President Ankvab's liberal policy towards ethnic Georgians in the Gali region. The opposition said these policies could endanger Abkhazia's ethnic Abkhazian identity. Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on the international community to act in response to the political unrest in Abkhazia. (See Issue of ethnic Georgians) *May 28: During the night, Russia's Deputy Security Council Secretary Rashid Nurgaliyev met with Ankvab, who described the events as an \\"armed coup attempt.\\" It was also reported that Ankvab met with Putin's aide Vladislav Surkov, who had traveled to Sukhumi with Nurgaliyev. On May 28 Surkov also met with opposition leaders Raul Khajimba, Sergei Shamba, Akhra Bzhaniya, and Vitaly Gabniy, as well as with the lawmakers of Abkhazia's parliament. On May 30 media reported that Ankvab moved to Russian Federation military base in Gudauta due to security concerns. *May 31: The Abkhaz parliament appointed speaker of the parliament Valeri Bganba as an acting President. It also decided to hold an early presidential election on August 24. The resolution said that the document was adopted \\"in connection with Alexander Ankvab's inability to exercise the powers and responsibilities of the President of the Republic of Abkhazia...\\" President Ankvab slammed parliament for urging him to step down and for a vote of no confidence in the Cabinet. *June 1: Ankvab resigned \\"with the goal of preserving stability in the country\\". Demonstrators started celebrating in the streets of Sukhumi. Acting President Valeri Bgangba stated that his main task now would be to hold a successful early presidential election. Ankvab stated that he will run in the election. Timeline after Alexander Ankvab's resignationJune 2: With his first Presidential decree, Bganba accepted Prime Minister Leonid Lakerbaia's resignation (submitted earlier on the same day), appointed Vice Premier Vladimir Delba as acting Prime Minister, and dismissed the Cabinet, requesting its members to continue performing their duties in an acting fashion until the election and the appointment of a new Cabinet. In accordance with the original demands of the protesters, Bganba also dismissed Timur Gogua and Beslan Arshba as Heads of the Tkvarcheli and Gali Districts, respectively, and proposed to Parliament to dismiss Safarbei Mikanba as Prosecutor General. *June 3: Acting President Valeri Bgangba stated that his main task now would be to hold a successful early presidential election. Ankvab stated that he will run in the election. :Chairman of the Central Election Committee Batal Tabagua announced that the Committee had begun preparations for the Presidential election set for 24 August, that candidates could be nominated between 25 June and 14 July and that parties registered less than five months before the election date would not be eligible to nominate candidates. :Valeri Bganba dismissed Indira Vardania as First Vice Premier, Beslan Arshba as Vice Premier (upon his own request) and Murman Jopua as head of the Ochamchira District (upon his own request). *June 4: Head of the Presidential Administration Beslan Kubrava and Security Council Secretary Nugzar Ashuba resigned, accusing the opposition of carrying out a witch hunt and imposing its decisions on the interim authorities. *June 5: The People's Assembly voted to dismiss Saferbei Mikanba as Prosecutor General. *June 6: Bganba appointed Deputy Prosecutor General Zurab Agumava as Acting Prosecutor General and Zurab Margania as First Deputy Head of the State Security Service. *June 9: Bganba appointed Astamur Tania as acting Head of the Presidential Administration and Avtandil Gartskia as acting Security Council Secretary. Raul Lolua, Head of the State Security Service's Special Forces Centre, appointed First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs to carry out the duties of Otar Khetsia, who was (put) on paid leave. (Bganba would formally dismiss Khetsia and appoint Lolua as Acting Minister on 4 August.) *June 13: Bganba appointed Beslan Butba as acting Vice Premier. Subsequent events On 27 June 2016, following a request by the opposition, the Prosecutor's Office published its assessment of the events surrounding Ankvab's resignation, and declared that it found no criminal actions to investigate. On 30 June, opposition leaders criticised the prosecutor office's analysis, in particular its claim that Ankvab's succession had been resolved in accordance with the Constitution of Abkhazia, and announced they would challenge the decision in Supreme Court.

Wilson's Farm is a neighborhood in Charleston, South Carolina. By 1746, a 55-acre tract of the upper Charleston peninsula had been subdivided from a larger parcel and sold to John Drayton who used the land as a farm known as \\"Pickpocket.\\" In 1757, 52-acres were transferred to Andrew Faesch and Peter Guinard. Pickpocket Plantation was managed by Sophia Faesch, and the house on the plantation was known as ‚ÄúSophy Hall.‚Äù Property at the northwest corner of Wilson's Farm (now 570 Rutledge Ave.) has been used for church purposes since Mrs. Shepherd conveyed the land to the Episcopal church in 1823. By the 19th century, the land was owned by the Shepherd family. In 1823, Mrs. Sophia Francis Perry Shepherd granted four lots in what she envisioned as ‚ÄúShepherdboro‚Äù to the Episcopal Church. She kept a 30 by 30 foot plot, however, for use as a family burial ground. The burial ground still exists just to the east of what is today operated as the Salem Baptist Church. After she died on September 16, 1873, Mrs. Wilson was buried in the burial ground she had reserved. A plat was drawn in 1893 which divided 36.53 acres of the farm into regular streets and lots for development. Legal fights between the family and the city delayed sales but began in 1898 and picked up pace in 1902 when commercial real estate companies were used to market the development. In 2012, the Preservation Society of Charleston held a special tour of the Wilson's Farm neighborhood. The Society wanted to focus attention on areas above the Highway 17 divide of the Charleston peninsula. Gallery Development of housing in Wilson's Farm began in the late 1890s and was largely complete by 1910. The build out of the neighborhood bridged an earlier period during which builders followed local customs (resulting in several traditional Charleston single houses) and a modern era during which builders followed national trends (resulting in American foursquares and variants). Regardless of form, late Victorian detailing can be seen on many of the houses.
