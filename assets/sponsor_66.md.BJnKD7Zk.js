The song features vocals from rappers Big H and JME, and was produced by The HeavyTrackerz, who have been credited with production for many other chart- successful songs. The song entered the UK Singles Chart on 20 May 2014 at number 13, which remains its highest charting position. Background and release The song was released on 13 April 2014, having achieved nationwide recognition beforehand. The song has been added to BBC Radio 1Xtra's A-list and has received support from BBC Radio 1, Kiss FM and Capital Radio. The song is a panegyric on the subject of driving high-quality German precision engineered motor cars with blacked out windows whilst leaning back. The phrase \\"whip\\" was used after various rappers noticed that the Mercedes-Benz logo resembled a steering wheel, which used to be called a whip. Music video The song has two music videos. The first was released in 2013, directed by Jay Parpworth and produced by SB.TV, gaining 10.4 million views and was shown nationwide via all major TV channels such as MTV and The Box. The second was released six months later and was produced by Vevo, and features an array of German cars. Critical reception Critical reception has been positive to mixed. Swarve Men Magazine called the song \\"awesomely catchy\\". Robert Foster of Bankholidaycomes.com said the song was a \\"little nugget of grime fun\\". In addition, Stagedoor.fm said that heaven would be \\"hot weather, coupled with the windows down, plus [the Skepta, Professor Green, Bossman Birdie & Rizzle Kicks] remix\\". However, Robin Murray of Clashmusic.com commended Meridian Dan's \\"untamed vocal\\", but dismissed the beat as \\"ridiculous\\". Complex magazine ranked the song second on their list of \\"Grime's Most Impatcful Songs of the 2010s\\", calling it an \\"anthem to kickstart the [grime] buzz - most importantly bringing grime back to commercial daytime radio\\". Legacy The song has been credited with steering grime's unexpected comeback. In addition, T-shirt Party created a T-shirt in homage to the song, which contains Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen logos.

It was originally opened in 1936 and ceased operations in 2002. The station building was confirmed as a cultural monument in March 2013. Service The station, which was built in an area previously known as ', went into service on 1 March 1936. The buildings were designed by Karel Caivas and Vladim√≠r Weiss, whereas Miroslav Chlumeck√Ω designed the track infrastructure. The purpose of the station was to relieve Prague city centre of freight train services. It was also used for warehousing, although the creation of a food warehouse in the district of Stra≈°nice in 1966 reduced the demand at the station. The station's formal service ceased in 2002. The access track with a rail branching is used for a container terminal which is adjacent to the freight station building and is in service up to now. Usage beyond 2002 Following its closure in 2002, parts of the station were leased to local businesses for use as a warehouse. The station hosted the Prague Biennale art exhibition in June 2013. In October of the same year, the 15th edition of the annual Designblok festival was hosted there. Redevelopment plans were proposed in November 2019.http://news.expats.cz/weekly-czech- news/redevelopment-of-zizkov-freight-station-moving-forward/ Cultural monument The three-winged main station building was denoted as a national cultural monument in 2010 by the Ministry of Culture, a move which was quickly challenged by local government and members of the local real estate development industry including the Sekyra Group. Developers had wanted to use the area to construct a new residential area to house 15,000 people. The building's status was however secured in March 2013, with its historical, technical and architectural value among the reasons cited for its confirmed status. Local transport The station is served by Prague's tram network with a stop bearing the station's name.

This word refers to the Jivanmukta. Overview Anavrtti means path of no return. It indicates the non-return of the soul to a new body, and refers to the end of the seemingly endless vicious cycle of birth, death and rebirth, the transmigration of soul from one body to another. Badarayana concludes with the statement: - ‡§Ö‡§®‡§æ‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§É ‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶‡§æ‡§¶‡§®‡§æ‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§É ‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶‡§æ‡§§‡•ç  (Brahma sutra IV.iv.22) ‚Äì \\"There is no return for the released souls on the strength of the upanishadic declaration\\". This word, characterized by no return, is very common in Vedanta literature. Upanishadic connection Before concluding his deliberation on Brahman, Badarayana explains that the released souls are of two kinds ‚Äì with or without bodies and senses; that the released soul gets all the divine powers except running the universe, and that Brahman does not abide in the effect as shown by Chandogya Upanishad (III.xii.6) ‚Äì :‡§§‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§§‡§§‡•ã ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§É  :‡§™‡§æ‡§¶‡•ã‡§Ω‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡§æ‡§¶‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡§ø  :\\" His divine majesty spreads that far; the whole universe of all these beings is but a quadrant of His. But Purusa (the infinite Being) is greater than that, His three immortal quadrants being established in His own effulgence.\\" He states that Brahman is the supreme Light beyond all changing things with which there is equality of experience alone. Having reached that state there is no return for the released soul. In this context Sankara states that Badarayana reiterates - ‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§® ‡§™‡•Å‡§®‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§É (\\"They no more return to this world\\") (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad VI.ii.15) or ‡§® ‡§ö ‡§™‡•Å‡§®‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡•á (\\"He does not return again\\") (Chandogya Upanishad VIII.xv.1), and adds that non-return stands as an accomplished fact for those from whom the darkness of ignorance has been completely removed as a result of their full illumination and who therefore cling to that liberation as their highest goal which exists ever as an already established fact; the non-return of those who take refuge in the qualified Brahman becomes a fact only because they too have that unconditioned Brahman as their ultimate resort. Rig Vedic connection The concept of Anavrtti has a direct relation with the concept of Transmigration of Souls. Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade in his book, A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy finds the concept of Transmigration of Souls developing in the Rig Veda. He draws our attention to the following mantras of Sukta 164 of Rishi Dirghatamas:- :‡§ï‡•ã ‡§¶‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§•‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§¶‡§®‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ ‡§¨‡§ø‡§≠‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§ø  :‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡§∏‡•É‡§ó‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§ï‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Å‡§™‡§ó‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§Æ‡•á‡§§‡§§‡•ç  whereby the Rishi asks, who has ever seen the precise mode in which the boneless soul, the very life-blood and informing spirit of the earth, comes to inhabit a bony tenement? And if a man did not know this himself, who has ever moved out of himself and gone to the wise man to receive illumination on it? (Rig Veda I.164.4), that :‡§Ö‡§®‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡§ó‡§æ‡§§‡•Å ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§Æ‡•á‡§ú‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Ü ‡§™‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ö‡§∞‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§ß‡§æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§∞‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§®‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Ø‡•ã‡§®‡§ø‡§É  this breathing, speedful, moving life-principle is firmly established inside these tenements (Rig Veda I.164.30), that :‡§Ö‡§™‡§æ‡§ô‡•ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ô‡•á‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§ß‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡•É‡§≠‡•Ä‡§§‡•ã‡§Ω‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§®‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Ø‡•ã‡§®‡§ø‡§É  :‡§§‡§æ ‡§∂‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•Ç‡§ö‡•Ä‡§®‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§ö‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§® ‡§®‡§ø ‡§ö‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∞‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç  the immortal principle, conjoined with the mortal one, moves backwards and forwards by virtue of its natural power; these two elements keep moving ceaselessly in opposite directions, with the result that people are able to see the one but are unable to see the other (Rig Veda I.164.38); that :‡§Ö‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§ó‡•ã‡§™‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡§ø‡§™‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ö ‡§™‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ö ‡§™‡§•‡§ø‡§≠‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§∏ ‡§∏‡§ß‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ö‡•ã‡§É ‡§∏ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•Ç‡§ö‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§Ü ‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ä‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§≠‡•Å‡§µ‡§®‡•á‡§∑‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§É  the Rishi tells us he himself saw (with his mind‚Äôs eye) the guardian of the body, moving unerringly by backward and forward paths, clothed in collected and diffusive splendor, only to keep returning frequently inside the mundane regions (Rig Veda I.164.31); :‡§Ø‡•á ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡•ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§Å ‡§â ‡§™‡§∞‡§æ‡§ö ‡§Ü‡§π‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á ‡§™‡§∞‡§æ‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡•ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§Å ‡§â ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ö ‡§Ü‡§π‡•Å‡§É  :‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§•‡•Å‡§É ‡§∏‡•ã‡§Æ ‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§ß‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ ‡§® ‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡•ã ‡§µ‡§π‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø  and talks of those who come hither as those who are moving away, and those who are moving back as already returning hither (Rig Veda I.164.19) Implication Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade clarifies that whenever there is recognized the possibility of the soul coming to inhabit a body as a god-like principle from without, wherever it is supposed that the soul could likewise part from the body as it came, wherever it is thought that the soul after parting from the body could lead a life of disembodied existence, and wherever it is supposed to return again to the earth and inhabit any form of existence whatsoever, there is a kind of undying life conceived for the soul. Sankara explains that the competent man, while performing all prescribed things in the householders life itself, living in the way described, to the end of his life, attains after death the world of Brahman and does not return again for becoming embodied. From the negation of return (‡§® ‡§ö ‡§™‡•Å‡§®‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡•á) which must occur as a matter of course, it follows that having reached the world of Hiranyagarbha through the Path of Light etc., he stays there as long as the world of Hiranyagarbha lasts, i.e. before that he does not return. The choice is the psychic death, the death that means the business of realization of our otherness out of love of true liberation, which is achieved by knowledge that even transcends abstract reason. Nature of Liberation The Jivanmukta on exhaustion of the Prarabdha karma attains Videha mukti (freedom from the body) at death and becomes one with Brahman. At the time of death the functions of the organs (Speech etc.) are merged in the mind (Brahma Sutras IV.ii.1). Then the mind is merged in Prana, and the Prana (the vital force) gets merged in the Jiva (the individual Soul) (Brahma Sutras IV.ii.3-4). This mode of departure is common for both the knower of the Saguna Brahman and the ignorant up to the beginning of their ways leading to immortality because it is something pertaining to this life. The subtle body lasts up to the attainment of Brahman. Pranas of the knower of the Nirguna Brahman do not depart from the individual soul, the soul passes out of the body with the Pranas which become merged in Brahman, and absolute non-distinction with Brahman takes place ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡§æ‡§ó‡§É, ‡§µ‡§ö‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡•ç (Brahma Sutras IV.ii.16). The soul of the knower of the Saguna Brahman comes to the heart at the time of death and thence goes out through the Susumna; it then follows the rays of the sun after death and goes to Brahmaloka ‚Äì ‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä (Brahma Sutras VI.ii.18). The texts refer to different paths and give their descriptions but Badarayana tells us that they refer to and give only different particulars of the same path ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§∞‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§®‡§æ, ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡•á‡§É (Brahma Sutras IV.iii.1) Impersonal immortality Mundaka Upanishad (III.ii.6-9) states that at the supreme moment of final departure having become identified with the supreme Immortality (Brahman) they pure in mind become freed on every side. To their resources repair the fifteen constituents (of the body) and to their respective gods go all the gods (of the senses), and the karmas and the soul that stimulates the intellect, all become unified with the supreme Undecaying (‡§™‡§∞‡•á‡§Ω‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡•á). As rivers, flowing down, become indistinguishable on reaching the sea by giving up their names and forms, so also the illumined soul, having become freed from name and form, reaches the self-effulgent Purusa that is higher than the higher Immutable; this Self is not attained by one devoid of strength, nor through delusion, nor through knowledge unassociated with monasticism, but the Self of that knower, who strives through these means, enters into the abode that is Brahman (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§Æ). This is absorption in divinity, this is the Doctrine of Impersonal Immortality. Kaushitaki Upanishad (I.4) tells us that when the soul comes to the Path of the Gods, the soul first goes to the world of Fire, then to the world of the Wind, to the world of Varuna, to that of the Sun, of Indra, of Prajapati, and finally to the world of Brahman. The soul knowing Brahman crosses the Ageless river merely by the motion of the mind and being free from good and free from evil moves towards Brahman.

The episode was written by Brett Matthews and Neil Reynolds and directed by Leslie Libman. Plot The episode starts with Stefan (Paul Wesley) having a vision of Tom saving a woman's life during a spell that Sloan (Caitlin McHugh) casts in order to link Stefan to Tom so they will find him. From the spell, Stefan can \\"see\\" that Tom works at the Atlanta Metropolitan Hospital, something that will help Caroline (Candice Accola) and Enzo (Michael Malarkey) find Tom easier and kill him. Elena (Nina Dobrev) wakes up next to Damon (Ian Somerhalder) after their break up sex. She realizes that it is Jeremy's (Steven R. McQueen) parent-teacher conference and she tries to sneak out without waking up Damon. Damon though is already awake and Elena reassures him that they are still broken up and what happened the previous night was a mistake before she leaves. Caroline and Enzo are already in Atlanta trying to find Tom when Sloan calls to tell them that the person's name they are looking for is Tom and where he works. Caroline gets mad at Sloan because she broke their deal and used Stefan again to link him to Tom, something that could lead Stefan to lose his memories. Sloan makes it clear that she does not care about Stefan's brain but about his blood and she reminds Caroline that as long as Tom is alive, Stefan and Elena's blood is useless to her. She threatens Stefan's life if Caroline fails to kill Tom. At Mystic Grill, Damon tries to get over his break up with Elena by drinking while Matt (Zach Roerig) and Tyler (Michael Trevino) see him and figure out that something is wrong between him and Elena. The three of them talk when Liv (Penelope Mitchell) walks into the bar and meets with Jeremy. They are surprised seeing them together, Damon leaves and Tyler tries to hear what Liv and Jeremy talk about but he cannot hear anything. Elena is on the phone with Bonnie (Kat Graham) while waiting in the line to the guidance counselor at Jeremy's school and tells her about her break up with Damon. They also realize that Jeremy was neither home or with Bonnie and they wonder where he was. Elena has to hung up because it is her turn to go to the guidance counselor while Bonnie spots Luke (Chris Brochu) sitting across the room. The counselor informs Elena that she is not Jeremy's primary contact when Damon appears and tells her that she asked him to take care of Jeremy while she was at Whitmore. The two of them spend the day together attending classes and with Damon trying to make her change her mind about their break up. Back in Atlanta, Caroline and Enzo find the hospital where Tom works but a doctor informs them that Tom has been missing for four months and no one knows where he is. Caroline calls Sloan and asks to talk to Stefan because their info was bad and they could not find Tom. She asks Stefan if he remembers any small details from his vision that could help them but he does not, so Sloan stars a new spell on Stefan despite Caroline's warnings not to. Stefan sees Tom talking to a girl named Hazel (Gena Shaw), who asks him to buy him a dinner for saving her friend's life and Tom accepts. Hazel gives him the address and Stefan is able to tell the address to Caroline. Caroline and Enzo find the address and Hazel but they cannot get into the house if someone does not invite them in. They see Hazel in a trance and they realize that she is a witch. Enzo kills her so they can enter the house. They find Tom in a coma and realize that Hazel was keeping him in that state to hide him for the last four months. Caroline wakes him and while she has to kill him, she instead snaps Enzo's neck and tells Tom that she is there to save him. The two of them go for a lunch where Caroline compels Tom to tell her everything about his life and she learns how Hazel kidnapped him. On their way back to the car, Enzo appears and kills Tom. In the meantime, at the Whitmore Bonnie talks to Luke when Hazel appears to pass through the anchor. Hazel asks Bonnie to inform Luke that she failed before she passes and Bonnie, confused, asks Luke about Hazel and to tell her the truth. Luke admits that he is Liv's twin brother and witch and that they were trying to keep the travelers away from Tom and that he and his sister are trying to find out why the travelers need Elena and Stefan's blood. Back at the Mystic Grill, Liv tells Jeremy that she needs his help to fight the travelers since he is a hunter and they cannot control his mind. She tells him some more details about the travelers and asks his help again so they can find why they need the blood of Elena and Stefan. While talking, Liv gets a text from Luke who informs her about Hazel and she leaves in a hurry. Jeremy calls Bonnie to ask about Elena and when Bonnie tells him that she is at school, he says that Elena might be in danger. Liv finds Elena at school and attacks her. Liv and her coven did everything they could to protect her but since now she is dangerous they have to kill her. Damon gets there in time and stops her. Damon ties her and threatens to kill her if she will not tell him what she wants. Liv says that now that there is only one male doppelganger, the travelers will come for Elena to use her. Jeremy arrives and asks Damon to free Liv because she knows more than she admits about the travelers and that he will not let her hurt Elena. Damon unwillingly does it because Elena says that she trusts her brother. Caroline goes back to the traveler's camp and tells Stefan what happened and realizes that Stefan let her go on purpose knowing that she would never hurt Tom or anyone because that's just who she is. At the Salvatore house, Elena tells Damon that she will go back to Whitmore and that they should stay away from each other because they are bad for each other. Jeremy joins them just to inform them that he will move in with Tyler and Matt. Elena tries to change his mind but when she realizes that he took his decision she lets him leave. Caroline and Stefan are sleeping back at the traveler's camp but wake up when they hear the travelers changing and walk there to investigate what is going on. They watch the travelers drink Elena and Stefan's blood and then Sloan sets one of them on fire, something that leads everyone to burn since they are linked. They all die and Stefan and Caroline run away not knowing what the ritual was about. The episode ends with the dead travelers appear at Whitmore where Bonnie is and they pass through her. Bonnie tries to get away from them because they are too many and the pain is unbearable but she cannot. After the last traveler passes through her, Bonnie collapses and a man comes from the Other Side through her to the outside world.

Meta Truscott attended St Joseph's Convent School, Nundah where she later completed a business course. For ten years, she worked in the office of a furniture firm and then five years in an accountant's office. Married in 1947, she had three children, including James Francis Truscott. In 1994, the Brisbane City Council named Meta Truscott Lane in Ashgrove to honour her contribution to Ashgrove local history. The Ashgrove Historical Society appointed her co-patron with Manfred Cross.  Diaries  On 1 January 1934, aged sixteen and a half, Truscott n√©e Hurley began her first diary; a Christmas gift from her maternal uncle, Christopher Dunne, Station Master at Toowoomba railway station. During September that year, her saddest entry recorded the sudden death of her father aged 63 in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Brisbane. On completing her first year, she was \\"hooked\\" and wrote a daily diary until her death. Notable entries include her witness account of a suicide. On Monday afternoon, 20 April 1936, while visiting The Gap, Sydney with her uncle, Christopher Dunne, they by chance shared a bench with a well-dressed, middle-aged man. He was later identified as William Albert Swivell. The three watched a ship sail through the Sydney Heads. Dunne asked Swivell if he knew the name of the ship. He answered, \\"The Nieuw Holland.\\" Soon after, Swivell walked away; he climbed to the top of the cliff and jumped to his death. Other significant entries describe the beginning and the end of World War II. The diaries record the stillness, the state of shock when war was declared and how Brisbane city went wild with joy the day the war ended. Her busiest year was 1988. Alongside writing her regular diary, she wrote two extra diaries: one for the Australian Bicentenary now lodged in the Ashgrove library and another for her two older grandchildren. She wrote two further diaries, one for her two younger grandchildren (1998) and one for her daughter (2003).  Published works  * Truscott, M.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic and in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. She was named for LaSalle, Quebec. LaSalle was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River- class building program. She was laid down on 4 June 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon and launched 11 December 1943. She was commissioned into the RCN on 29 June 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy.

Resource slack can be considered as the opposite of resource scarcity or resource constraints. The availability of resources can therefore be defined in terms of resource slack versus constraints, as two ends of a continuum. Resource slack then refers to the relative abundance of the resource, and resource constraints refer to its limited availability. However, the effects of both resource slack and resource constraints are ambiguous, as both can have both negative and positive consequences. Both new and established firms need resources for their survival,Pfeffer, J. & G. R. Salancik (2003), The external control of organizations: A resource dependence perspective. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. growthPenrose, E. (1959), The theory of the growth of the firm. New York, NY: Wiley. and sustainable competitive advantage. On the other hand, severe resource constraints hinder the growth of firms and lower the probability of their survival. However, resource constraints have also been observed to foster creativity and force firms to deal with problems promptly. Moreover, slack resources tend to improve firms‚Äô financial performance, serve to buffer environmental shocks and allow for more discretion and flexibility in responding to competitors. However, large amounts of resources could also hinder the entrepreneurial process by impairing the firm's ability to identify new business opportunities.Mosakowski, E. (2002), Overcoming resource disadvantages in entrepreneurial firms: When less is more. In: M.A. Hitt, R.D. Ireland, S.M. Camp & D.L. Saxton (eds.), Strategic entrepreneurship: Creating a new mindset. Oxford, UK: Wiley-Blackwell. These contradictory potential outcomes of resource slack/constraints on creativity and performance have been explained in terms of an inverse U-shaped relationship and context-dependent effects, in terms of the different resource categories in relation to different creativity aspects, as well as the underlying dynamics of resource constraints and slack. The latter dynamic perspective implies that, for example, entrepreneurs perceive resource constraints/slack as transient positions relative to their start-up‚Äôs own resource demands at any given moment.

His landmark work was the 1949 book on the History and Social influence of the Potato, a book that established the history of nutrients as a new literary genre. Background Bust of Salaman's mother Sarah Salaman was born in Kensington, London and was the ninth of fifteen children born to his parents Sarah Solomon and Myer Salaman who was a wealthy merchant who traded in ostrich feathers at the height of the plume trade. The Salaman family were Ashkenazi Jews, who according to Salaman, migrated to Britain from either Holland or the Rhineland in the early 18th century. Education Salaman was educated at St Paul's School, London initially studying classics but due to the dull teaching methods he switched to studying science and later became head boy of the Science Side of the school. He obtained a scholarship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1893 and graduated with a first class degree in Natural Sciences in 1896 having studied physiology, zoology and chemistry. He was tutored and advised by the physiologist W. H. Gaskell who later became a good friend of Salaman. He moved to the London Hospital in 1896 to study medicine and remained there until he qualified in 1900. Research In 1903, Salaman was appointed Director of the Pathological Institute at the London Hospital but in 1904 he developed tuberculosis and had to stop practising medicine and spend six months in a Swiss sanitorium. It took him over two years to fully recover from the illness, changing the course of his entire life. He purchased a house in Barley, Hertfordshire and because he could not return to practising medicine began experimenting in the emerging science of genetics under the guidance of his friend William Bateson. After several failed experiments with a range of animals, Salaman decided to experiment with potatoes after seeking advice from his gardener. Later in his career, commenting on his decision to study potatoes Salaman noted that he had \\"embarked on an enterprise which, after forty years, leaves more questions unsolved than were thought at that time to exist. Whether it was mere luck, or whether the potato and I were destined for life partnership, I do not know, but from that moment my course was set, and I became ever more involved in problems associated directly or indirectly with a plant with which I had no particular affinity, gustatory or romantic\\". Working in his private garden, he initially set out to cross two potato varieties and establish which traits were dominant and recessive in a similar manner to Gregor Mendel's work on peas, but he soon broadened into other areas. In 1908, he decided to include wild potatoes in his experiments and requested that Kew Gardens provide him with Solanum maglia. Kew's stocks had been incorrectly labelled however and Salaman was sent Solanum edinense instead. In 1909, Salaman grew 40 self-fertilised crosses of S. edinense and found that seven of them did not succumb to late blight (Phytophthora infestans). Convinced that resistance to late blight existed in wild species he began to study other species and found that Solanum demissum was also resistant to blight. Salaman started to cross S. demissum with domesticated varieties of potato in 1911 to produce high yielding lines that were also resistant to late blight. By 1914, he had successfully created hybrids and in 1926 he remarked that he had produced varieties with \\"reasonably good economic characteristics which, no matter what their maturity, appeared to be immune to late blight. Salaman was the first to identify genetic resistance to late blight and S. demissum was still used as a source of resistance in the 1950s. In The Propitious Esculent, John Reader called Salaman's discovery \\"an important breakthrough, offering real promise ... that it was possible to breed blight-resistant potato varieties\\". In 1987, it was thought that half of the potato varieties cultivated in Europe contained genes from S. demissum. In 1910, he published a paper the inheritance of colour in potato in the first issue of the Journal of Genetics. Later papers in the Journal of Agricultural Science examined male sterility, methods for estimating yields and detecting viruses in seed potatoes and a study of how the size of seed tubers affected the yield and size of tubers of the crop. He wrote the book Potato Varieties in 1929. His research on potatoes was disrupted by the outbreak of the First World War during which Salaman joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in Palestine. Afterwards he was appointed chairman of the potato synonym committee at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany where he was tasked with describing potato varieties and putting an end to the common practice of marketing old and unreliable varieties under new names. His work there culminated in the publication of Potato Varieties in 1926. The same year he persuaded the Ministry of Agriculture to establish the Potato Virus Research Institute in Cambridge of which he remained a director until 1939. Kenneth Manley Smith was an entomologist at the institute and Frederick Charles Bawden became Salaman's assistant in 1930. Smith and Bawden went on to become renowned plant virologists. In conjunction with Paul A. Murphy of Dublin a large stock of virus-free potatoes was built up and multiplied in greenhouses, a practice which continued after his death and was adopted in other countries. His research on viruses lead to him being elected to the Royal Society in 1935. Salaman supervised the PhD thesis of Jack Hawkes, who went on to become an authority in the taxonomy of wild potato species and identified sources of resistance to potato cyst nematodes. The History and Social Influence of the Potato Salaman authored The History and Social Influence of the Potato first published in 1949, reprinted in 1970 and revised under the guidance of Jack Hawkes in 1987. A review of the first edition in the British Journal of Sociology noted that it was an \\"unusual and vastly interesting book which took nine years to write, and a life-time to prepare\\" combining genetics, history and archaeology. The book covers every aspect of the history of the potato with a particular focus on Ireland about which he wrote \\"in no other country can [potato's] influence on the domestic and economic life of the people be studied to greater advantage\\". The historian Eric Hobsbawm referred to the work as \\"that magnificent monument of scholarship and humanity\\". A 1999 paper in Potato Research noted that because of Salaman's \\"unprecedented\\" book, we \\"know more about the impact of the diffusion of potato on the welfare of people, particularly the poor, than about such consequences following the introduction of any other major food plant.\\" Views Salaman combined active Zionism with research into the genetics and social history of the potato, which led him to an interest in eugenics and racial explanations for Arab \\"failure\\". In 1919, he was uncomfortably conscious that clearing Palestine of Arabs would be \\"simply ridiculous and comparable to Cromwell's effort in Ireland\\", and the chief moral he drew from the Holocaust was the peril of attributing misfortune to racial characteristics rather than political oppression. Personal life On 23 October 1901, Salaman married first to Hebrew scholar Nina Ruth Davis, whom he had met four months earlier at the New West End Synagogue. They were engaged ten days after meeting. After living in Berlin for several months, while Redcliffe completed advanced training in pathology, they returned to London, where he assumed the directorship of the Pathological Institute at the London Hospital. They had six children including a cancer researcher, a doctor, the engineer Raphael Salaman, the artist Ruth Collet and the singer Esther Salaman. They settled in the country, in the village of Barley in Hertfordshire where they lived with their six children (one of whom died in childhood). Nina Salaman continued to pursue her interest in medieval Hebrew poetry. Despite Barley's distance from London, she maintained a kosher home and Sabbath observance. For the festivals, the family traveled to London, where they stayed with one of Redcliffe's siblings and worshipped at the New West End Synagogue. She took personal responsibility for the Hebrew education of her children until they left for boarding school. Salaman's paternal granddaughter is Chair of Jewish Voice for Labour Jenny Manson. In 1925, Salaman's first wife Nina died. In 1926, he met and married Gertrude Lowy who survived him.

Such agencies specialize in marketing faith-based products and creating partnerships that target specific groups, such as the family-based audience. In the United States this type of marketing can help reach Christians, who enjoy an estimated purchasing power of over $5.1 trillion a year.The 2007 Leisure Market Research Handbook. (2007). Faith Based Activities, p. 180-183. Marketing research conducted by Nokia has shown that one of the most-desired features that adherent Muslims look for in cell phones is a Qibla finder that will orient them towards Mecca during prayer. As the desire for religion-on-demand grows, more modern, technologically-advanced products are being designed to help believers maintain traditional religious practices. Faith-based design allows companies to reach strong existing markets in new ways.  Market segments  Many Christian book and music titles have become successes in the mainstream world. The best-selling Purpose Driven Life by Christian pastor Rick Warren became the bestselling hardback non-fiction book in history, and is the second most-translated book in the world, after the Bible. In 2004, the Mel Gibson-directed The Passion of the Christ opened to $83.8M domestically and went on to gross $611M worldwide. In 2014, the Christian films Son of God, Noah, Heaven Is for Real' and God's Not Dead, enjoyed box-office success. Faith-based marketing is also seen in the tourism industry. The UN World Tourism Organization estimates that 300 million to 330 million people a year participate in faith-based travel. The U.S. Travel Association reports that 25% of all travelers are interested in a spiritual vacation. Many companies incorporate faith-based ideas in their operations, mission statements, or even their packaging, subtly or overtly.  Costs of faith-based marketing  Efforts to market or run a business based on religious faith can face unique challenges. In 2012, Chick-fil-A, who has \\"made a name [for itself] promoting Christian principles in its charity work\\", drew controversy after its CEO Dan Cathy suggested that he opposed same-sex marriage, which led to protests. Those protests did not appear to damage the company's sales. Hobby Lobby, another Christian business,Hutchins, p. 207 filed a lawsuit, now styled Sebelius v.

He is the author of over 60 academic articles, a book and two edited volumes. While Sadr has contributed to the Kalahari Debate, his more recent work has focused on historical revision, re-examining the acquisition of domesticated animals and pottery in southern Africa by Hunter-gatherer. His work is reintroducing the term Neolithic back into southern African archaeological discourse from which it had previously been removed.  Biography  Karim Sadr was born in Tehran, Iran, 1959. He began his studies at the Southern Methodist University(SMU)in Dallas, Texas, where he continued to the completion of his doctorate in anthropology. Sadr received his doctorate in 1988 for ‚ÄúThe Development of Nomadism in Northeast Africa‚Äù under the supervision of Professor Anthony Marks. Karim Sadr remained at SMU as a research associate until 1990. He would later receive two post-doctoral fellowships: the first from the American Research Centre in Egypt and the second from the University of Cape Town (UCT). In 1992 he took the position of Director for Archaeology at Centro Ricerche sul Deserto Orientale (CeRDO). After leaving CeRDO in 1995, he took up a lectureship in the history department of the University of Botswana (UB): Gaborone. Beginning in 2001, he has established himself at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he is currently a Senior Lecturer and Associate Professor in the school of Geography, Archeology and Environmental Studies Sciences (GAES). He currently holds the position of Head of School.  Re-introducing the Neolithic to Southern Africa  The term Neolithic has been used in a variety of ways with varying definitions and originates in description of European archaeology. The Neolithic refers to a period which is distinguished by the use of stone tools with food-producing practices but has also been associated with pottery. The orthodox view in southern African archaeology is largely that food-producing pastoralists‚Äîconventionally known as the Khoekhoe‚Äîintroduced domesticated animals, pottery and metal tools to the region. This view originates in 1929, when A.J.H. Goodwin and Clarence van Riet Lowe‚Äîthen the director of the South African Bureau of Archaeology‚Äì decided that the divisions applied to European technological developments were not appropriate to the study of southern Africa. They argued for the removal of the term 'Neolithic' from the common vocabulary of the discipline, and suggested that the Iron Age had come about as a result of imported technologies. The apparent result of this long-lasting viewpoint is the simultaneous introduction of domesticates, pottery and metal tools as part of an Iron Age migration of pastoralists into southern Africa. The result of this idea is that no room is left for a 'Neolithic' era, defined‚Äîin part‚Äîby stone tools. Instances of pottery and domesticated animals have become synonymous with the Iron Age, and as such, have steadily come be seen as evidence of the Khoekhoe. Conversely, Karim Sadr and Garth Sampson have argued that there were two distinct pottery techniques in southern Africa: thick walled pottery, and a distinct, thin walled variant, which are associated with specific contexts. The thin walled pottery has become associated with southern African Late Stone Age sites and early northern Khoehkoe pottery in Angola; whereas the thick walled examples were uniformly associated with later pastoralists. The method of production in the thin- walled examples used fibre temper, resulting in lighter and more easily transportable pottery in southern Africa34, while mineral-base pottery is heavier and associated with thick walled ware. Sadr and Sampson argue that this is either evidence of diffusion of technological ideas with out migrant influx or of hunter-gatherers independently inventing pottery before the arrival of food producers. Dating has shown that the influx of pottery in 600‚Äì1000 CE occurs substantially after the first thin walled pottery had been produced around the southern reaches of Africa, at approximately 300 CE37. In the 1960s, examples of hunters-gatherer sites with domesticated animal (sheep) remains were discovered, and were suggested by Richard Elphick to have been indicative of hunter-gathers either stealing from or trading with nearby Khoekhoe herders. Sadr has argued that to suppose that the Khoekhoe were the source of domesticated animals is no longer acceptable. In the subsequent three decades, no evidence has been found suggesting that this was the cas,e while sites in the Seacow river valley and Kasteelberg have instead provided evidence of \\"hunters-with-sheep\\". In arguing that hunter-gatherers in southern Africa where from a period of \\"hunters-with-sheep\\", during which pottery was independently invented, Karim Sadr has challenged the primacy of Iron Age pastoralism in southern African archaeology and opened a case for the acceptance of the Neolithic. Despite this, Sadr does suggest that there is room for his view to co-exist with a more orthodox one.  Criticisms  Andrew Smith has commented that Sadr has been \\"seduced by the assumption that all people are just waiting to become food producers\\". Smith also argues that Sadr's work on \\"hunters-with-sheep\\" implies that becoming a shepherd without a pastoral role model would be easy for a hunter to accomplish when, as Smith claims; learning animal husbandry would instead require contact with pastoralism. Sadr has not at this point formally responded to these criticisms.  Selected publications  = Books = 1\\\\. Sadr, K. 1991. The Development of Nomadism in Ancient Northeast Africa.

In 2000, the administrative area was subdivided into Matlab Dakshin Upazila and Matlab Uttar Upazila. The Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS) was established in 1963 by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, (icddr,b, former Pakistan SEATO Cholera Research Laboratory). Matlab contains the largest population under continuous PSCRL surveillance in the world. The area is representative of many rural and riverine deltas in Bangladesh, and is one of the richest and longest-running longitudinal data sources within the developing world. In 1960, a group of American and Bangladeshi scientists journeyed across a cholera-prone sub-district of Bangladesh on a barge-turned-floating cholera hospital. This particular barge was used around Matlab to treat patients with cholera otherwise inaccessible due to their remote location. This is the story of the Matlab HDSS which would develop into the Matlab Health Research Centre - a full-fledged health care facility and one of the most important research sites in the world. In 1966, a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) was established in Matlab to record data regarding birth, death and migration. Initially the main purpose was to conduct cholera vaccine trials and to track the trends of public health problems of rural Bangladesh. One of the most important roles Matlab played in the field of public health was through the development of an oral rehydration solution (ORS). The ORS, at the time created from salt, molasses and water, was first trialed in 1968 at Matlab. It is now considered one of the most important medical advances of the 20th century and estimated to have saved around 50 million lives globally. Geography Matlab is a former thana of the Chandpur district of Bangladesh, situated 55 km southeast of Dhaka. its total area in regards to the HDSS is 184 km2. Three seasons are typical: monsoon, cool-dry, and hot-dry, and the climate is sub-tropical. It is subject to annual flooding due to its position within low-lying flatlands. Average annual rainfall is approximately 2159mm, concentrated mainly during monsoon season (June to September). Inception, structure and procedure During its inception, 132 villages were included and 101 villages were added in 1968. Traditional Birth Attendants (dais, elderly illiterate women mostly) used to work to detect and record data of the vital events through weekly household visit. Health Assistants (HA) along with the Dais visited households every six weeks with standard registration forms. In 1977, major modification of field structure and programme activities were made, leading to the exclusion of 84 villages and the retention of 149 villages. The Family Planning and Health Services Project was then launched in 70 villages with the remaining 79 villages not included intentionally to serve as a comparison area. The Dais of both treated areas and comparison areas were eventually replaced by female Community Health Workers (CHW). In 1993, due to river erosion, 7 villages within the comparison area disappeared, reducing the project to 142 villages. However, the majority of villagers resettled within nearby villages still participating in the HDSS. A typical village in Bangladesh consists of several baris ‚Äì groups of houses centered around courtyards ‚Äì which function as economic and social units. The HDSS system covers all houses within these areas. Data is collected from individuals who are regular residents (either permanent or those who have resided continuously within these areas for at least 6 months.) Birth, death, and migrations have been recorded since 1966, and the recording of marriages and divorces began in 1975. Recording of split households and changes in family type began after the 1993 census. Data is collected within treatment and comparison areas through the Record Keeping System (RKS). The health data currently covers married women of reproductive age (data includes reproductive status, contraception, tetanus, etc.) and children under 5 (immunization, diarrhea, acute lower respiratory infection, breastfeeding, etc.). The Geographical Information System (GIS) was introduced in 1993. In HDSS's administrative term, three projects are running in the area: DSS, RKS and GIS. The system also collects socio-economic data. Field procedures Washing vegetables and filtering water through cloth in Matlab a) Initial census and regular update rounds - CHWs collect data through monthly household visits. They also provide health services to mothers and children in treatment areas, while in comparison areas they simply advise residents to visit government health facilities. b) Continuous surveys - CHWs enquire about demographic events which have occurred since their last visit. Special forms and record keeping books (RKBs) are used to keep health data. c) Supervision and quality control - field research assistants supervise CHWs, while overall field activities are supervised by field managers. Priority research area Fertility, reproductive health, maternal and child health, child morbidity and causes of death, health equity, and climate change. Impact of Matlab on public health The development of oral rehydration saline. Family planning: the introduction of CHWs in 1970 greatly increased contraceptive use and reduced fertility. These methods were later adopted internationally. Immunization: Matlab showed that 63% of childhood deaths were due to vaccine-preventable disease and could be prevented by effective immunization campaigns. Child health and family planning: child mortality has been reduced by about 75% within the last 25 years due to the combined efforts of childhood health and family planning programmes.

Origins According to Armenian sources, Izad Gushnasp was a member of the House of Mihran, and the son of a certain Ashtat. According to the Armenian historian Ghazar Parpetsi, Izad Gushnasp was also the foster brother of the Sasanian king (shah) Peroz I, who was the son of shah Yazdegerd II. However, according to the Iranian historian Ibn Isfandiyar, Izad Gushnasp and Ashtat were brothers from Daylam in northern Iran, but due to falling out with one of the most prominent and powerful noble of the Wuzurgan class in Daylam, had to leave the region and settle further east in Mazandaran.Pourshariati (2008), p. 72 Biography Map of Persian Armenia. In 451, the Christian Armenians, who were under constant persecution by the Sasanian shah Yazdegerd II, revolted against the latter under their leader Vardan Mamikonian. Izad Gushnasp, along with Ashtat, played a prominent role in the suppression of the revolt. They managed to capture several Armenian nobles along with their priest, and had them imprisoned in Nishapur. During the reign of Yazdegerd's son Peroz I, Izad Gushnasp was in ca. 464 ordered to take the imprisoned Armenians to Herat to use them in their army. Izad Gushnasp is later mentioned as the commander of Bolberd, a fortress northeast to the city of Karin. The fortress had many gold mines, which was greatly important for the Sasanians to protect from the Byzantines. During this period, the relations between Izad Gushnasp's family and Peroz I was flourishing, and Peroz even later married the daughter of Ashtat.Pourshariati (2008), p. 73 In 482, the Armenians along with the Iberians, rebelled against the Sasanians. Peroz I responded by sending several armies to subdue the rebels. Some time later, the Sasanian noble Zarmihr Karen from the Karenid family, was successful in a campaign against the Armenians, and managed to capture several of them, including nobles from the Kamsarakan family. Zarmihr shortly delivered the Armenian captives to another general named Shapur Mihran, who delivered them to Izad Gushnasp at Bolberd.Pourshariati (2008), p. 74 After this event, Izad Gushnasp is no longer mentioned in any source.

They speak Pennsylvania German as their mother tongue as well as English with outsiders. There is a subgroup of the Swartzentruber Amish, that is also called \\"Andy Weaver\\".  History  In Holmes County, Ohio, the Andy Weaver Amish were formed in 1952 over the issue of shunning. They were named after Andrew J. Weaver, a conservative minister who took a stand against \\"drift\\", that is moving towards mainstream society.  Customs and technology  They are less conservative than the Swartzentruber Amish but more conservative than the Old Order main body. Compared to them they have greater restrictions on farm, business and home technologies, a stricter interpretation of shunning, stricter youth regulations and a greater tolerance of alcohol and tobacco.  Districts and populations  Most of the Andy Weaver Amish live in Holmes County, Ohio, where they had 30 church districts in 2009.Hurst, Charles E.; McConnell, David L.: An Amish Paradox: Diversity and Change in the World's Largest Amish Community, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore 2010, page 26. .

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the St. Lawrence and the Battle of the Atlantic. She was the second ship to bear the name of L√©vis, the first being a Flower-class corvette that had been sunk earlier in the war. She was named for L√©vis, Quebec. L√©vis was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 25 February 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon and launched 26 November 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 21 July 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in Bermuda, L√©vis joined escort group EG 27 at Halifax, Nova Scotia in September. She remained with this unit until June 1945 performing anti-submarine patrols and convoy escort duty. It was during this period that she fought in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. On 4 June 1945 L√©vis began a tropicalization refit at Lunenburg in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. The refit was completed on 26 November and she sailed for the west coast. L√©vis arrived at Esquimalt, British Columbia on 30 January 1946 and was paid off there on 21 February. She was sold to Capital Iron & Metals Ltd. of Victoria, British Columbia in 1947. Her hull was stripped and she was sunk as a breakwater in Oyster Bay, British Columbia in 1948. References Notes References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

Map of Caracas by 1578 with the square on it marked as Plaza. Bol√≠var Square (Spanish: Plaza Bol√≠var) in Caracas is one of the most important and recognized Venezuelan public spaces. It is located in the center of the first 25 blocks of Caracas when it was founded as \\"Santiago de Le√≥n de Caracas\\" in 1567. It is in the historic center of the city in the Cathedral Parish of the Libertador Municipality. Bol√≠var Square is surrounded by important buildings such as Caracas Cathedral, Sacred Museum, Archbishop's Palace, City Hall, Chapel of Santa Rosa de Lima, the Yellow House, the Main Theater and the building of the Government of the Capital District. The Federal Legislative Palace stands to the Southwest. History This place was intended as the Plaza Mayor of Caracas as soon as it was founded to serve as a trade center in town. For centuries, many modifications were made to the square, but one of the most significant was that of 1754 when Governor Felipe Ricardos ordered the construction of arcades to surround the square. The square was a usual place to fusillade and execute political enemies and conspirators of the Spanish colonial government. The execution of Jos√© Mar√≠a Espa√±a was the best known. His body was quartered in the square in 1799. Additionally, this was the place where the Venezuelan people won the first step towards their independence when a popular rebellion rose against the Spanish crown on April 19, 1810. Although it is one of the most emblematic sites in the country, it is not the largest. The Plaza Bol√≠var of Maracay, Aragua state, surpasses it in size, being the biggest in Venezuela and Latin America. After independence, the square was called Plaza de Armas (Arms Square) and Plaza del Mercado (Market Square), but when the body of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var arrived in Caracas from Santa Marta, it was formally named Plaza Bol√≠var in 1842. Nevertheless, that name was not properly used until 1874.Distrito Capital-Plaza Bol√≠var Gobierno en L√≠nea General Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco was put in charge of the presidency in 1865 by the then president Marshal Juan Cris√≥stomo Falc√≥n. Blanco decided to demolish the arcades around the squareDemolici√≥n de los portales de la Plaza Mayor Historia de Venezuela en Im√°genes and remove the market vendors in May. Projects to recover the place started five years later. A renewal process with a French style square started in 1872, including the presidential decision to erect a statue of Bol√≠var by the month of November. Also, it was decided to build planters, plant trees, recreate the four seasons in the corners: spring, summer, autumn and winter with four fountains of ornamental iron, install about 100 iron posts with different decorations and to border the square with metal balusters. The small stairs in the southeast of the square gave name to that corner known as Gradillas, meaning small terrace corner.  Statue  The statue of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var was inaugurated on November 7, 1874 in the center of the square with the ringing of bells and 21 guns. This is a replica of the statue by Adamo Tadolino located at the Bolivar Square in Lima, Peru. Cast by the Von M√ºller Foundry, Bol√≠var rides a horse standing on its hind legs, supported by the two tiered pedestal. It measures 4 meters high (10 feet). The decision to install electricity in the square was made in 1894, and since then, there were no significant changes until 1967, when the original colourful floor was replaced by gray marble. Several terminal stations of the former Caracas tram worked in the corners of the square during 1908 and 1947. On February 21, 1959, the statue was designated as a memorial. In mid-2003, the Municipality of Libertador undertook a process of full restoration of the square, including gardens, fountains, flooring, lighting, among others.

The first novel in the series was published on May 12, 2013. The series is set in a fictional widespread location known as the Endless Woods. The original trilogy (known as The School Years) follows the adventures of best friends Sophie and Agatha at the School for Good and Evil, an enchanted institution where children are trained to become fairytale heroes or villains, respectively. The second trilogy (The Camelot Years) follows Agatha and her true love King Tedros ascending to the role of Queen and King of the legendary kingdom, Camelot, and Sophie re-forming Evil into a new image. The final book in the series was released on June 2, 2020. Shortly after the first book's release date, Universal Pictures acquired rights to make the series into live- action feature films. In 2020, Netflix announced it would take over and release a film adaptation of the novel, directed by Paul Feig. Synopsis =The School for Good and Evil= In the village of Gavaldon, every 4 years, on the eleventh night of the eleventh month, two children at the age of 12 and older are kidnapped by an unknown force into the surrounding Woods. At a random point in once a year a box of storybooks would appear outside the village bookshop. From the stamps on the book boxes and the familiar faces in those fairy tales every 4 years, it is deduced that the kidnapped children are spirited away to the \\"School for Good and Evil,\\" where they train to be fairy tale heroes and heroines or villains. While most children fear the unknown force, nicknamed \\"the School Master,\\" pink-loving, beautiful Sophie dreams of being kidnapped to go to the School for Good to become a princess, and live out a Happily Ever After with a charming prince. Meanwhile, her best friend, Agatha, is the complete opposite of her, with her clumps (shoes), sulky attitude, and ugly face, as well as the fact that she lives in a graveyard, so, therefore, is deemed by the villagers to be a perfect candidate for the School for Evil. As the feared day every 4 years arrives again, Agatha attempts to drag Sophie back to Gavaldon upon witnessing her capture but instead gets dragged along with Sophie, and both of them are transported to the schools. Much to Sophie and Agatha's horror, both of them are sent to what seems to be the \\"wrong\\" schools: Sophie ends up as a \\"Never\\" student in the School for Evil, and Agatha an \\"Ever\\" student in the School for Good. Sophie attempts to switch schools with Agatha to no avail, whilst her best friend just wants both of them to go home together. This proves difficult, as Sophie is determined that she is Good and is smitten soon after by the most popular prince in school, Tedros, who is also the son of King Arthur and the best character. He also takes notice of her. Sophie and Agatha have trouble when all of their escape attempts are thwarted with the schools' tight security system. Sophie is desperate to be Good but Agatha doesn't want to be at either school and just wants to go back to their original life. Sophie has always been determined to be good, so it's hard to face that she's in the school for evil. She thinks that it is a mistake, but soon learns more about herself and Agatha. Being forced to attend classes in the meantime, Agatha flunks most of her classes, but discovers a powerful ability in her‚Äîshe can hear and grant wishes, something that can only come from a pure Good heart. Sophie inadvertently starts ranking well in her classes despite desperately wanting to fail to prove her place in Good, pitting her against Hester, her roommate, and daughter of Hansel and Gretel's witch. Unable to take anymore, Agatha drags Sophie with her to the School Master's tower, where Sophie confronts the harsh truth that she cannot switch schools and thus decides to return home with her best friend. He cryptically tasks them with solving a riddle that questions what Evil cannot have that Good cannot live without, and promises if the pair can solve the riddle, he will set them free. As Hester, Anadil, and Dot (Sophie's roommates) try to help solve the riddle to make Sophie leave, they explain how they're used to be one Good School Master and one Evil one until a Great War broke between them and one killed the other, although no one knows who won. Due to Good's 200-year winning streak, most of the people who live in the woods suspect the Good School Master to be the one alive today. They soon realize that the answer to the riddle is \\"true love's kiss\\". Agatha deduces that if Sophie, a Never, kisses Tedros and in doing so proving Evil can love, the two girls are able to go home. Agatha tries to help her friend get Tedros's kiss with her strengths but soon finds out that Sophie is only using Agatha to make Tedros fall for her. That way, she would never have to leave, as she believes Tedros is her true love. Finally, Tedros promises to kiss Sophie after they both win the Trial by Tale, a test in which the top ten Good and Evil students enter a simulation of the Woods, aiming to survive until sunset by avoiding teachers' traps and the opposite side. In letting an Ever and a Never come out together alive, this will prove that both sides can unite as one --- a big upset to the laws that have always governed to a fairytale world. However, their relationship ultimately ends during the Trial when Tedros discovers Agatha's illegal participation to help Sophie to win, and when Sophie refuses to protect him out of selfishness. Hoodwinking Good's greatest prince then wins Sophie popularity at the School for Evil and the title of \\"#1 Villain\\". At the same time, Sophie begins to show deepening resentment and anger towards Agatha, as she now believes Agatha ruined her chances for a Happily Ever After. Tedros decides not to tell on Agatha as he starts to develop feelings for her after she risked dying in the Trial to save him, unlike Sophie. Both girls begin to undergo subtle but sure changes: Agatha finds her own inner beauty and belief in Good and true love after consultation with the Dean of Good Professor Clarissa Dovey; while Sophie begins to suffer from Nemesis Dreams, dreams that the best villains have that expose who they must kill as their Nemesis to survive their fairy tale. Sophie believes that the person in her dreams is Tedros, but however, another rule to Nemesis Dreams is that as time progresses, the villain will grow weaker, and the Nemesis will grow stronger. Tedros did not show obvious strengthening, but on the other hand, Agatha was progressively becoming a better princess, Sophie learns that it is not Tedros who is her true Nemesis, but Agatha. In the Circus of Talents where Nevers and Evers compete for their own unique talents, Tedros confesses his love for Agatha and requests that she be his date for the Evers' Snow Ball, to which she accepts. Sophie overhears this and ultimately transforms into what she has become internally: a bald, jealous, toothless, shrivelled witch with no remorse. She proceeds to destroy both schools and attempt to eliminate her Nemesis, Agatha. Determined for her happy ending, Sophie finds the School Master's true identity to be Evil as the Storian is atoning for the Evil School Master's murder of the Good one, and as he tells her about his wish for his one true love, Sophie. She believes that she can find Happily Ever After with him instead of Tedros and that she was Evil all along, but upon kissing him, she heartrendingly remembers Nevers are incapable of love. As Agatha catches up with her best friend, the School Master prepares to kill her so that he can take Sophie for himself. Just when the Storian was about to spear Agatha's heart, Sophie did something that shocked the School Master‚Äîshe stepped in front of her best friend, sacrificing her own life for her. The ghost of the deceased Good brother returns to save his students, and since only seers can hold dead souls, seer and history teacher, Professor August Sader sacrificed his own body to help the Good brother to destroy the Evil School Master and dies in the process. Sophie dies shortly after, losing too much blood to the cut at her heart, and Agatha, distraught, kisses her. Not long after this, however, Sophie revives as Agatha's kiss had proved that Evil could love, and she and Agatha are teleported back to Gavaldon, implying that they realized they don't need a prince after all. Tedros was left in disappointment as his one true love had disappeared from him, just before the Evers‚Äô Snow Ball. This leaves the students of the schools in surprise as they realize the teachings about Good and Evil being incapable of friendship were untrue. =A World Without Princes= Agatha and Sophie have returned home and they are accepted as heroes. Unfortunately for Agatha, Sophie is taking advantage of this opening. Whereas Agatha wants nothing to do with fame, Sophie puts on many shows. At Sophie's father's wedding, Agatha suddenly wishes for another ending to her story and ending with Tedros. This wish causes magical arrows to come and messages saying to give Sophie to them. Angry, the town turns into a mob demanding Sophie be given to whoever wants her. The Elders say that they are protecting Sophie, but in reality, they are planning to give in to the mob. They tell Sophie to stay in the church alone; and Agatha, thinking that Sophie would be safe, leaves. Sophie is taken into the forest with a message on her chest made from her own blood. She is hung on a tree with the message Take Me and left to die. Agatha finds Sophie and runs away with her trying not to be attacked by the mob. They soon arrive at a flower ground line and notice butterflies trying to help them. They get on a train unknowingly bound for the School of Good and Evil. Arriving at the doors of the School for Good, now the School for Girls, they are swamped by a herd of girls from both schools robed in blue. As the girls are introduced to their classmates (including a silent girl named Yara) and taken around by the new Dean, Evelyn Sader, they notice that the school has been changed and the fairy tales on the walls have changed as a result, with the damsels in distress now becoming warrior women. Agatha mentions the absence of boys, and it is discovered that after they left, all the girls from the School for Evil were repelled and had to come to the School for Good seeking refuge. The boys from the School for Good were then expelled by an unseen force and had to go to the School for Evil. As the truth and impact of what they have done settle on the girls, Sophie is horrified to discover that they are back due to Agatha's wish for a different ending to their tale, mainly that she ends up with Tedros. Agatha denies this and insists that all she wants to do is return home. Agatha sneaks into the School for Boys with Sophie following her under an invisible cape to stop her from kissing Tedros. Agatha attempts to speak with Tedros, does, and almost kisses him, but at the moment before they do, Tedros becomes paranoid about Sophie still being alive and able to seek revenge and starts raving. As they argue, Sophie hidden underneath a table in the room seizes the opportunity and shoots a spell between them. Agatha thinks Tedros attacked her and Tedros thinks Agatha attacked him and they both start fighting. Agatha then flees, convinced that Tedros is evil. She returns to the School for Good where Sophie is waiting for her, pretending not to have known a thing. Eventually, it is decided that one of the girls must become a boy to integrate into the School for Boys and steal the Storian. Sophie is chosen (due to her surprisingly masculine sense of willpower and perseverance) and integrates into the boys' school. Soon Sophie's name as a boy is Filip(The name Sophie's father originally wanted to name Sophie before she was born, thinking she was a boy). Filip and Tedros have problems at first, but soon, Filip is protecting Tedros. Then they become the best of friends. Filip confesses to Tedros that he (Sophie) would do anything to see his (her) mother again. Tedros says he wouldn't want to see his because his dad (King Arthur) sent out a warrant for her head (she had cheated on King Arthur with Sir Lancelot), and when he turns 16, he'd have to honour that warrant. Later on in the forest at the Trial by Tale, Agatha is in hiding when Fillip comes with Tedros. Soon, Agatha sees that Tedros leans in to kiss Filip, but Agatha only sees their lips almost touch. This causes a dispute between the three, and Filip turns back into Sophie as the spell wears off. Tedros is confused and angry, but then, the Dean of the new School for Girls, Evelyn Sader, half-sister of August Sader, has her butterflies fly off trees as they carry the Storian and Evelyn to the trio. The New Dean brings out Sophie and Agatha's fairy tale book and lets the Storian write. Agatha and Tedros kiss because Agatha told Sophie that she couldn't trust her anymore, and Sophie was turning into a witch again. The Storian is about to finish writing the end, but the Dean stops it. Evelyn reveals that it was not Agatha's wish that brought them back to the school, but rather Sophie's wish to see her mother, who had been abandoned by her husband when she fell sick and later died. Sophie, in grief, having lost her village, her family and now her best friend, accepts her wish, and Evelyn conjures the School Master's ghost, in the guise of Sophie's mother. Sophie kisses the ghost and as it becomes the School Master, who explains that a true love's kiss can even revive the dead, just as Agatha revived Sophie. The School Master kills Evelyn and sends Agatha home. The School Master tries to kill Tedros, but Agatha manages to grab Tedros and takes him with her. Sophie however, is left behind refusing to leave the School Master, stating that he was the only one who didn't abandon her. The two schools become a malevolent School for Evil together. As the two girls are separated, they both remain in the arms of the ones who love them, their wishes granted. =The Last Ever After= Three weeks following the events of 'A World Without Princes', both schools have fallen under the rule of the returned School Master, with the original School for Evil becoming the 'School for Old Evil' and the School for Good becoming the 'School for New Evil'. Still, the change is all but complete as the School Master, named Rafal, still has to 'marry' Sophie and ultimately start his campaign to destroy Good. Though hesitating, she is afraid she might end up alone forever, taking into account of Agatha and Tedros' supposed betrayals when ignoring her pleas for help. Sophie accepts the proposal and becomes a teacher for the School for New Evil, but the Storian still does not accept this as a rightful 'happy ending'. Sophie and Agatha's storybook has been open too long now. This starts a countdown in which the sun grows weaker each passing day, and when the final dusk settles, it will mean the end of all the fairytale world. Meanwhile, Agatha and Tedros, back in Gavaldon, attempt to remain in hiding and reconcile but are forced to escape when the people of Gavaldon tries to execute them both for all the woes she and Sophie previously caused. Agatha's 'mother', Callis, sacrifices herself to buy time for them both to escape to the Endless Woods. Arriving there, they are rescued by Professor Uma, who explains that Rafal's return has allowed the return of old villains as undead and that the remaining original heroes (including Cinderella, Peter Pan, Hansel and Gretel, Briar Rose, Jack and Pinocchio) are formed in a League of Thirteen led by Merlin to combat against the Rafal's assaults. It becomes clear that he is seeking to alter the original fairytales, starting with the murder of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and following with Rapunzel and Tom Thumb. Agatha and Tedros, despite a rocky beginning, are eventually assigned by Merlin to destroy Rafal's ring, which keeps so much his sustenance as his 'empire' alive, but under the strict condition that Sophie must be the one to deliver the killing blow. It can only be performed with the sword Excalibur that Tedros lost on the day of Rafal's return. They realize the Excalibur is being guarded in the School for Old Evil, and thus Agatha sets to recover the sword while Tedros sets out to rescue Sophie and attempt to convince her to give up her engagement with Rafal. Aided by Sophie's former friends Hester, Anadil, Dot, and Hort, they manage to infiltrate the School and perform both tasks as they then run away, with Rafal mysteriously allowing them to escape. Merlin guides Agatha, Sophie and Tedros to Avalon, where Tedros discovers Guinevere and Lancelot still alive. Despite his initial grudges against both, he slowly and painfully comes to forgive them as he learns further of Arthur's previous paranoiac behaviour and domineering issues. Agatha, on her part, becomes willing to give up her love for Tedros so Sophie can have him instead, more driven by her reluctance in becoming the future Queen of Camelot than by her personal feelings. Despite their best efforts, however, the plan ultimately fails when Sophie and Tedros kiss and both realize they were never meant for each other. Believing she was used all along, she returns to Rafal, accepting her place by his side and becoming the Queen of Evil. Against her wills, Agatha is chosen as the Queen of Good as both parties prepare for war. The final battle is to take place in Gavaldon, still untouched because of an energy barrier fed by people's beliefs in fairytales, but weakening due to Rafal's altered stories, and is being targeted for reasons unknown. During training, Agatha also learns of Cinderella's true fairytale, where she claims that she did not want to be a princess at all. She believed her stepsisters, who were really kind to her, deserved it, and that she would simply tag along. Her marriage to the prince caused a permanent rift between her and the stepsisters, who were ultimately killed. The battle takes place in the Stymph Woods close to Gavaldon, which Merlin manages to sway all the School's students against Rafal and Sophie with Lady Lesso's aid, having been revealed as the traitor trying to undermine Evil's efforts. Sophie, with Agatha in hot pursuit, tracks Lady Lesso down to the School for Old Evil, who discloses to her that Evil was never meant to destroy Good or vice versa but instead become a harmonic part of it. She and Agatha also discover the corpse of Sophie's mother Vanessa and the tale behind both her and Callis, in which Sophie and Agatha discover to be twin sisters, explaining the inseparable bond between them. Still, while Agatha sees this as a chance to heal wounds, Sophie remains still, determined to keep her union with Rafal by any means. She thinks if she deserts Rafal, she will be alone forever, and Agatha is determined to make her see that her fear is not true. The battle ultimately shifts in Evil's favour as Cinderella dies and the barrier protecting Gavaldon fails, allowing Rafal to invade. However, instead of destroying the town, he takes Sophie's father's Stefan for execution by Sophie's own hands, as a 'final sacrifice for love' and Evil's ultimate victory. In a last, desperate effort, Agatha reminds Sophie of her friendship, making her realize she already had a happy ending of her own and was risking destroying it. Sophie has a change of heart at the last second and deceives Rafal, destroying his ring and ultimately killing him, saving everyone in the nick of time. Full of regret, Sophie, Agatha and Stefan make amends, with Sophie finally letting Stefan have a family of his own as she and Agatha pull back to the Endless Woods. (Now being fairytale characters, Sophie and Agatha cannot exist anymore in the reader world.) There, they also give their farewell to Lady Lesso, who was fatally stabbed in battle by her son, Aric. Lady Lesso and Cinderella are promptly buried and everything is seemingly returning to its normal state, with Tedros, Agatha and Sophie meaning to head together to Camelot, when Sophie discovers she was chosen by Lady Lesso to be her successor as Dean for the School of Evil. Agatha and Tedros depart alone to Camelot and Sophie comes to fully embrace her new role and purpose and is content with herself, remarking \\"I am me\\". Reception Critical reception for the first book in the series has been positive, and the book has received praise from The Guardian and the Miami Herald. =Awards= *Waterstone's Children's Book Prize for Best Fiction for 5-12 (2014, nominee for The School for Good and Evil) References External links  Princess Not-So- Charming at Harvard Magazine Category:2010s fantasy novels Category:American children's novels Category:American fantasy novel series Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:Hexalogies Category:Novels based on fairy tales Category:Novels set in schools Category:Series of children's books ","title":"The School for Good and Evil"},{"id":"42418444","text":"Eberhard Bopst (25 December 1913 ‚Äì 12 October 1942) was a German U-boat commander in World War II.

S., LI Dihua. (2011). The negative approach to urban growth planning of Beijing, China. Journal of Environmental Planning & Management, 54(9), 1209-1236. doi: 10.1080/09640568.2011.564488 It is a new concept and terminology raise by Chinese landscape architect, Professor of Peking University YU Kongjian. Negative approach does not mean anti urban planning as its name may seem to suggest, nor does it simply refer to green space priority. It is a new approach to physical planning of cities and a landscape methodology of planning. It distinguishes itself from other theories as it is an innovation and a possibly practical way of solving urban planning problems in Chinese cities.  Background  The negative approach is proposed by Yu in the degrading ecological background and chaos of city planning in China, especially big cities. This approach argues that when it comes to dealing with issues brought up by rapid urban development, the conventional ‚Äòpopulation speculation‚Äìland use‚Äìinfrastructure layout‚Äô approach ‚Äòhas been proven invalid‚Äô and responsible for the ‚Äòchaotic situation and degrading ecological conditions‚Äô and ‚Äòloss of cultural and spiritual landscape‚Äô in Chinese cities like Beijing and Shenzhen. So Yu raises an ecological planning methodology which gives priority to planning of EI (ecological infrastructure),YU Kongjian, L. D., HAN Xili (2005). ON THE ‚ÄúNEGATIVE PLANNING‚Äù. City Planning Review, 29(9), 64-69 and tries to ‚Äòprovide land use and urban planning with a solid ecological basis‚Äô.  Theory  The negative approach is based on both eastern and western ecological planning theories, especially the McHarg‚Äôs theory of Design with NatureMcHarg, I. L. (1995). Design With Nature: San Val, Incorporated. and Landscape Urbanism.Waldheim, C. (2006). Landscape as Urbanism: Princeton Architectural Press. The Landscape Urbanism takes landscape rather than architecture as the ‚Äòbasic building block or urbanism‚Äô. It can be understood as the contrary of Architecture Urbanism, which uses buildings, road networks and other constructions to define urban forms.Kongjian, Y. (2009). \\"Landscape Urbanism\\" and \\"Negative Approach Planning\\" (P. E. News, Trans.). In H. Y. Xiang Yunke (Ed.), 2009 China Landscape Architecture Education Conference & Landscape Architects Conference (pp. 1). Beijing: PKU English News Yu said in an interview during the 2009 China Landscape Architecture Education Conference & Landscape Architects Conference that he considers the negative approach ‚Äòthe Chinese version of Landscape Urbanism‚Äô. The negative approach mainly focuses on landscape as its operation field, meaning to use landscape, rather than the architectures or other constructions as the infrastructure to shape urban form. The key for negative approach is planning in Ecological Infrastructure. It takes traditional Chinese art of Feng-shui as a pre-scientific model, because Feng- shui takes natural pattern as priority which is quite similar to the aim of negative planning. Furthermore, the negative approach takes ‚Äòthe 19th century notion of greenways as recreational infrastructure, the early 20th century idea of green belts as urban form makers, and the late 20th century notion of ecological networks and Ecological Infrastructure (EI) as a biological preservation framework‚Äô.  Objective  Facing the challenges in today‚Äôs Chinese urban planning, Yu discusses about the ethic of land use in China and referred the land as Chinese gods, he argues that we should ‚Äògo back to earth‚Äô and let the ‚Äògod of earth‚Äô come back to life in his book Negative Planning Method. He points out that the core of planning in Chinese cities should be sustainability for development on limit land. And this is what negative planning should care about.Kongjian, Y. (2005). Negative Planning Methods (1st Edition ed.): China Architecture & Building Press. Its purpose is to develop land while maintaining the ecological and cultural integrity, to shape landscape form and urban form in a sustainable way. ‚ÄòThe overall objectives are smart preservation and smart growth‚Äô.  Method  To accomplish these goals, negative approach consists of the following steps: # 1) Process analysis: Using software and tools like GIS to systematically analyze landscapes for ecosystem functions or services which are targeted to be safeguarded by EI. This step includes: Abiotic processes, Biotic processes and Cultural processes. # 2) Defining landscape SPs: SP refers to Superposition. It includes Water process (flood control) SP, Geological disasters prevention SP, Biodiversity SP, Cultural heritage protection SP and Recreation SP. Landscape SPs contain important ‚Äòelements and spatial position‚Äô in ‚Äòsafeguarding the different process‚Äô. # 3) Defining EI: The SPs are integrated by overlaying techniques to form comprehensive Ecological Infraestructure at variety levels: high, medium, low. # 4) Defining urban form: In this step, we can develop scenarios of regional urban growth patterns by ‚Äòusing the multiple EI alternatives as framing structures‚Äô. The decision makers of the city now can evaluate from economical, ecological and social aspects and pick from the scenarios.

The regiment distinguished itself in operations with its defence of Chhamb in Jammu and Kashmir during the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War winning one Maha Vir Chakra. The regiment has provided three Army Commanders including one Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Gurbachan Singh 'Buch', Gen Shankar Roychowdhury, ADC (Retd) and Lt Gen Pradeep Khanna, ADC (Retd). Origin The regiment was formed in 1921 by amalgamating 14th Murray's Jat Lancers, raised in 1857 with 15th Lancers (Cureton's Multanis) raised in 1858. The regiment served till 1937, when it was removed from the order of battle and deactivated. It was converted into a training regiment, eventually forming part of the Indian Armoured Corps Corps Training Centre at Lucknow. Following the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the regiment was allotted to India. The centre moved in 1948 to Ahmednagar and merged with other establishments to become the Armoured Corps Centre and School. The regiment was re-raised by the Indian Army on 10 July 1956 at Jodhpur, Rajasthan. The first Commanding Officer of the re-raised regiment was Lieutenant Colonel Umrao Singh. The regiment was equipped with AMX-13 tanks. When the regiment was re-raised, the Officer's Mess Silver of the old 20th Lancers was handed over to it. The troops on raising were from the Sikhs of the 6th DCO Lancers which were transferred to 8th Light Cavalry and half of the squadron of the Jodhpur Lancers which were transferred to the 7th Light Cavalry. The Pakistan Army raised an armoured regiment called 20th Lancers on 20 June 1956, which it considers to be the successor of the old 20th Lancers of the British Indian Army.Nath (2009), pp. 731‚Äì732. Operations The regiment saw action in 1962 during Indo-China War in Leh then during the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War in Chhamb-Jaurian in Jammu & Kashmir. 20 Lancers was under command of the 10th Infantry Division during the 1965 operations. Pakistan's surprise attack on 1 September, Operation Grand Slam, fell on 191 Infantry Brigade which was supported by 'C' Squadron of the regiment, under Maj Bhaskar Roy. The armoured attack comprised two regiments of medium tanks, M-48 Pattons and M-36 Sherman B-2 tank destroyers. The attack began at 0805 hours and was strongly resisted. During the initial phases of the attack, Roy destroyed 6 Pattons, 3 recoil-less guns and captured a jeep. A second attack was launched by Pakistani armour at 1100 hours and contested by the AMX-13s of 20 Lancers, which despite being outgunned and outnumbered, destroyed a total 13 tanks that day and prevented the encirclement of 191 Infantry Brigade. The regiment later fought in the defence of Jaurian under 41 Infantry Brigade. For the defense of Chhamb-Jaurian, the regiment was awarded a theatre honour and Maj Bhaskar Roy was awarded Maha Vir Chakra for his leadership in this action. Battle honours The battle honours of the regiment are: ;Pre-World War I Charasiah - Kabul 1879 - Afghanistan 1878-80 ; World War I Neuve Chapelle - France and Flanders 1914-15 - Kut al Amara 1917 - Sharqat - Mesopotamia 1916-18 - Persia 1916-19 - NW Frontier India - 1915 ;Indo-Pak Conflict 1965 Jammu and Kashmir 1965 ;Notes References Category:Armoured and cavalry regiments of the Indian Army from 1947 Category:Regiments of the Indian Army ","title":"20 Lancers (India)"},{"id":"42418522","text":"Iprocrolol is a beta blocker that was never marketed.

It is part of the Catholic parish of Cratloe. Name The name Cill Fintinan would mean \\"Church of Fintinan\\", but there is no known Irish Saint Fintinan. The name is therefore thought to come from Cill Fionn tSeanain, or \\"Church of the fair Senan\\". Location The parish is in the barony of Bunratty Lower, and contains a small part of the town of Sixmilebridge. It contains the village of Cratloe. It extends south from this town to the River Shannon. The parish includes two small islands of Grass and Graigue in the Shannon. The road from Limerick to Ennis crosses the north of the parish. It is and covers . Antiquities and history The old church of Kilfintinan in the townland of Ballybrohan was almost entirely demolished by 1897. The church of Cruach√°n in the townland of Brickhill was in reasonably good condition. It was large, and surrounded by a large graveyard. There was another graveyard called Cill-an- bothair in the Ballyliddane townland, but no trace of a church. An old cromlech in very good condition stood near the Cruach√°n ruins. There was another nearby, but it had been demolished. On the hill called the Leacht, near the cromlechs, there was the grave of an unknown Irish chieftain from pre-Christian times. As of 1837 the ruins of the castles of Cratloe, Cratloe Kail, and Ballintlea were still visible. The Ballintea castle is not found in the 1580 list of castles. In the mid-18th century there was a shortage of Catholic priests in the region. The parish of Kilfintinan was therefore merged with part of the parish of Killeely, forming what is now known as the parish of Cratloe after the village of that name. The population in 1841 was 2,633 in 424 houses. At that time there were two Catholic chapels.

January 15, 950Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.) was an official and general of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms-period states Later Tang, Later Jin, Later Han, and Later Shu. During the reign of Later Han's second emperor Liu Chengyou, he, fearing defamation by the official Hou Yi (), rebelled against Later Han in conjunction with Li Shouzhen and Zhao Siwan, and also submitted to Later Shu. After repeated defeats, however, he committed suicide.  Background  It is not known when Wang Jingchong was born, but it is known that he was from Xing Prefecture (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei). He was said to be intelligent and capable of debating, as well as being good at serving others. During the time that the Jin general Li Siyuan served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Anguo Circuit (ÂÆâÂúã, headquartered at Xing Prefecture), Wang served as an officer at his headquarters. He subsequently followed Li on his campaigns.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 53.Li Siyuan served as the military governor of Anguo from 916 to 923, and therefore Wang's service under him must have been during that period. See Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 269, 272.  During Later Tang  After Li Siyuan became emperor of Jin's successor state Later Tang in 926, Wang Jingchong became a protocol officer (ÈÄö‰∫ãËàç‰∫∫, Tongshi Sheren). He was often given responsibilities of welcoming emissaries from the circuits, delivering imperial edicts to the circuits, and monitoring armies on campaigns.  During Later Jin  During the time of Later Tang's successor state Later Jin, founded by Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang, Wang Jingchong continued to serve the imperial government. In 937, when Shi was commissioning the general An Chongrong as the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) to displace the Chengde officer Mi Qiong (), who had seized control of the circuit in the confusion of Later Tang's fall and Later Jin's founding, Shi sent Wang to Chengde to persuade Mi to yield the control of the circuit to An. He was able to persuade Mi to do so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Wang was eventually promoted to be a general of the imperial guards, but apparently had little actual authority. He was often distressed about not being given greater authority by the Later Jin emperors (Shi Jingtang and his nephew and successor Shi Chonggui).  During the Liao occupation  In 947, Later Jin was destroyed by its northern neighbor, the Khitan state Liao. Liao's Emperor Taizong initially claimed to be the emperor of China as well, but soon tired of the uprisings against him. He left his brother-in-law Xiao Han in charge of the Later Jin capital Kaifeng (as military governor of Xuanwu Circuit ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. During the time that Xiao was at Kaifeng, Wang tried to bribe Xiao's subordinate Gao Muohan (), hoping that Xiao would give him greater authority. However, soon thereafter, Emperor Taizong died on the way back to Liao proper, and was succeeded by his nephew Emperor Shizong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. The anti-Liao uprisings intensified, and Xiao wanted to abandon Xuanwu and return to Liao proper as well, but wanted to keep some resemblance of a continuation of government. He therefore forced Li Siyuan's son Li Congyi the Prince of Xu to assume the title of emperor, and then left Kaifeng in Li Congyi's control. Li Congyi commissioned Wang as the director of palace affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩ‰Ωø, Xuanhuishi). However, Li Congyi's court was not supported by the Han uprisings, and instead, the former Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan, who had claimed the title of emperor of a new state of Later Han, was gaining strength. Liu was thereafter advancing toward Kaifeng. Wang took the money in the imperial treasury and left Kaifeng, submitting to Liu. Li Congyi subsequently submitted to Liu as well, allowing him to enter Kaifeng and take over control of the realm.  During Later Han  After Liu Zhiyuan entered Kaifeng, he commissioned Wang Jinchong as a general of the imperial guards, but was not impressed by Wang at that point. He did not have Wang accompany him when, shortly after, Du Chongwei the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), rose and resisted him and he then attacked Tianxiong's capital Yedu () in response. Wang, however, volunteered to deliver the reports of the defender of Kaifeng (apparently, Liu's son Liu Chengxun ()) to Liu Zhiyuan's camp. When he met Liu Zhiyuan to deliver the reports, he requested that he be allowed to remain in the imperial army and participate in the siege of Yedu. He also made many tactical proposals to Liu Zhiyuan and argued persuasively for his proposals, impressing Liu Zhiyuan. During the time of Du's resistance against Liu Zhiyuan (which was not successful, and Du eventually surrendered to Liu), two Liao-commissioned military governors to the west, Hou Yi () the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Zhao Kuangzan () the military governor of Jinchang Circuit (ÊôâÊòå, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), were unsure of how they would be received by the Later Han emperor, and therefore submitted their realms to Later Shu's emperor Meng Chang. However, after Du's defeat, they both became fearful, offering to submit to Later Han and to head to Kaifeng to pay homage to the Later Han emperor, even as Later Shu forces were on the way to put those circuits firmly into Later Shu hands. Liu Zhiyuan decided to dispatch Wang and another general, Qi Cangzhen () to the region, ostensibly against Dangxiang tribesmen who were intercepting Huigu emissaries, but in reality to take control of Jinchang and Fengxiang. Before Wang departed Kaifeng, Liu summoned him into the emperor's bedroom and stated to him privately: By the time that Wang and Qi arrived at Jinchang's capital Chang'an in spring 948, Zhao had already left for Kaifeng. Wang mobilized the Jinchang troops, as well as Zhao's personal guards (which he left in Chang'an in order to alleviate fears about him), to prepare to resist Later Shu forces, although he was concerned that Zhao's personal guards might flee, and therefore considered tattooing their faces to mark them. Zhao's officer Zhao Siwan was enthusiastic about the idea and volunteered to be tattooed first. Qi found this to be a sign of treachery, and therefore suggested that Wang kill Zhao Siwan; Wang refused. Wang subsequently defeated the Later Shu generals Li Tinggui (), and the Later Shu forces withdrew, particularly after Hou changed his mind and resisted them. During the meantime, though, Liu Zhiyuan died and was succeeded by his son Liu Chengyou. (Liu Chengxun was older, but had died earlier.)Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 105. When Wang arrived at Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality, Hou had not yet left for Kaifeng. Wang quickly had the imperial guard soldiers under him take control of the city gates, and he considered, as his staff members suggested to him, killing Hou. However, he hesitated because the instructions he had were given by Liu Zhiyuan, without Liu Chengyou's knowledge, and that if he killed Hou, Liu Chengyou might believe that he had killed Hou wrongfully. Meanwhile, though, Hou had heard rumors that Wang might kill him, and therefore slipped out of the city and headed for Kaifeng. This upset Wang for not having anticipated Hou's action.  Rebellion against Later Han and death  Upon Hou Yi's arrival at Kaifeng, he expended his wealth to bribe the major officials and generals that Liu Zhiyuan had left to be in charge of Liu Chengyou's administration, and therefore was made the mayor of Kaifeng. He then used his new influence in the Later Han imperial administration to repeatedly defame Wang Jingchong. Wang, hearing this, became disappointed and fearful. At that time, it happened that the imperial government sent the imperial attendant Wang Yi () to summon Zhao Kuangzan's personal guards to Kaifeng. These guard soldiers became fearful, and Wang Jingchong encouraged them into mutinying. They therefore did, under Zhao Siwan's leadership, and seized control of Chang'an. Meanwhile, Wang Jingchong himself enticed the people and officials at Fengxiang to petition the imperial government to have him (Wang) made military governor of Fengxiang. The imperial government, apprehensive about Wang Jingchong's intentions, refused, and issued orders transferring Wang Shou'en () the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) to Jinchang (which was renamed Yongxing () and Zhao Hui () the military governor of Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) to Fengxiang. The same orders also commissioned Wang Jingchong as the acting military governor of Jingnan. Wang Jingchong found excuses to delay his departure from Fengxiang, and for some time tried to order the Jingnan troops to join him. He also made overtures to Later Shu, testing out Later Shu's willingness to aid him. Meanwhile, around the same time, Li Shouzhen the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) rebelled and claimed the title of Prince of Qin. Wang thereafter accepted both commissions from Li Shouzhen and Later Shu, with Later Shu renaming Fengxiang to Qiyang () and making him its military governor. The Later Han imperial government sent the major general Guo Wei against the three rebels. Guo, under the advice of Hu Yanke () and seeing Li as the main threat, decided to act against Li first, believing that once he destroyed Li, Zhao Siwan and Wang would be more easily defeated. He therefore marched directly to Huguo's capital Hezhong Municipality () and put it under siege. Meanwhile, Zhao Hui advanced to Fengxiang and put it under siege. He defeated the Later Shu army that Meng Chang sent to aid Wang, and then had a corps of his army pretend to be the Later Shu army. When Wang exited Fengxiang to try to join his army with the \\"Later Shu\\" army, he was caught in a trap and defeated. He fled back inside the city and continued to defend it. Another subsequent attempt by the Later Shu general An Siqian () to aid Wang was also repelled by Zhao. By late 949, Wang's potential allies were all destroyed or repelled ‚Äî with Zhao Siwan's having first surrendered to Later Han but then reconsidering a rebellion, and then was killed; Li's city of Hezhong having fallen to Guo and Li's having committed suicide; and Later Shu forces making no inroads into aiding him. Wang's strategist Zhou Can () suggested to him that he surrender to Later Han. Wang hesitated. Several days later, with the city close to falling to Zhao Hui, Wang ordered his officers Gongsun Nian () and Zhang Silian () to pretend to surrender to Zhao by heading out the east gate and setting fire to it, while he and Zhou would attack Zhao's forces at the north gate. When Gongsun and Zhang were carrying out their part of the orders, they received news that Wang had set his own headquarters on fire, and his family had died in the fire. They, and Zhou, all surrendered to Zhao Hui.  Notes and references  * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 53. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 281, 287, 288.

King George I became his godfather.Starhemberg: Georg Adam , at deutsche-biographie.de (in German) He had two notable greatuncles. Gundaker Thomas von Starhemberg (1663‚Äì1745), a financial expert at the court in Vienna who played a key role in the education of Georg Adam and Count Ernst R√ºdiger von Starhemberg (1638‚Äì1701), the military governor of Vienna and leading figure in the Battle of Vienna and the subsequent Great Turkish War from 1683 to 1699.A. Graf Th√ºrheim (1889). Ludwig F√ºrst Starhemberg. Eine Lebensskizze, p.165 In 1727, when Georg Adam was three years of age, he experienced the loss of his father who died at the age of just 38 years. Georg Adam received his education in Vienna conducted under the auspices of his mother and his greatuncle, Austrian minister of finance Gundaker Thomas von Starhemberg. Subsequently he did his Grand Tour; in the company of a mentor he visited a number of capitals and courts in Europe. In 1742, at the age of 18, Count Georg Adam von Starhemberg joined Austrian civil service. In 1748, he was appointed 'Aulic Councillor of the Empire' (Reichshofrat) and became chamberlain (Kammerherr) of Archduke Joseph, the eldest son of Empress Maria Theresa. The following years he travelled as an envoy to Lisbon, Trieste, Madrid and Paris where he met Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz. Kaunitz was married to Countess Maria Ernestine von Starhemberg (1717‚Äì1749), a granddaughter of Georg Adam's greatuncle and educator Gundaker Thomas Graf von Starhemberg. In 1754 Count Georg Adam was sent to Paris as Imperial envoy and stayed there for the next twelve years. Along with Kaunitz he paved the way for a rapprochement between the Habsburgian rulers and France after a long-standing history of conflict. He tried to influence the French king primarily by Louis' chief mistress, the Marquise de Pompadour. The first meeting between the Austrian envoy and the marquise for this purpose took place on 30 August 1755.A. Graf Th√ºrheim (1889). Ludwig F√ºrst Starhemberg. Eine Lebensskizze, p.167 In 1756 the Treaty of Versailles was concluded with his participation. In Paris, Starhemberg also successfully negotiated the marriage between the Habsburg Archduchess Maria Antonia and the Duke of Berry, the future king Louis XVI of France. In 1770 he accompanied the archduchess to the first encounter with her future husband. The same year he was sent to Brussels as authorized minister (minister plenipotentiary) in the Austrian Netherlands, since his predecessor Count Karl von Cobenzl had died in January of that year.Franz A. J. Szabo (1994). Kaunitz and Enlightened Absolutism 1753-1780, p. 65A. Graf Th√ºrheim (1889). Ludwig F√ºrst Starhemberg. Eine Lebensskizze, p.176-77 One of the reasons that influenced the decision to send Starhemberg to Brussels was that Joseph II who had become co-ruler in 1765 had been disappointed by Starhemberg and now wanted to remove him from the vicinity of his mother, Empress Maria Theresa, in Vienna. Starhemberg remained the next 13 years in Brussels where he successfully stimulated the development of the provinces in the Austrian Netherlands in spite of the fact that Joseph had limited his powers. During the American War of Independence Starhemberg tried to establish trade contacts with the emerging young nation. Georg Adam, Prince of Starhemberg also managed to found the first academy of the Austrian Netherlands in Brussels in 1772 by converting Count Karl von Cobenzl's 'Literary Society' into the 'Imperial and Royal Academy of Science and Letters' of Brussels with the approval of the Empress Maria Theresa.A.

He makes use of computer-aided design, shaping the metal components with a plasma cutter, and completing his work by use of traditional metalworking techniques. Howe notably designed a cauldron and accompanying kinetic sculpture for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, Brazil. Education and work Howe attended The Taft School between 1969 and 1973, and for the next 6 years was enrolled at Cornell University and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In 1979 he built a house on a remote mountaintop in New Hampshire. Here he painted beautiful landscapes for a wonderful five years, and displayed his work at 'Gallery on the Green' in Lexington, Massachusetts. His paintings may be found in the collections of Teradyne, Harvard University, the William Small collection and other public and private collections. In 1985 Howe moved to New York City and turned from painting to kinetic sculpting. Four years later his first work was hung from old elevator cables stretched between buildings. In 1993 he joined the Kim Foster Gallery in New York, and the following year moved to Orcas Island in Washington, where he once again built a house and opened his own gallery. He claims one of his methods of testing the sculptures is by fixing them to top of his van and then driving down the local airstrip. In August 2015, Howe was offered the role of designing a cauldron for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The games' organizers had decided not to have a larger cauldron and flame as part of an effort to be environmentally conscious, resulting in the construction of a small cauldron with a larger kinetic sculpture to accompany it; the sculpture, which consists of ring of rotating bars, a 40 ft (12.2 m) in diameter, with reflective plates and spheres, was meant to enhance the appearance of the smaller flame, providing an effect inspired by the \\"pulsing energy and reflection of light\\" of the sun. The sculpture was designed at his studio on Orcas Island, with final construction occurring in Montreal before being shipped to Rio.

For nearly sixty years the hospital sat on a 47-acre parcel at the junction of SE Stark Street and 96th Avenue. Formerly agricultural land, the site was developed as a psychiatric hospital complex and working farm in 1910. After World War II, many of the farmers in the surrounding area retired and their land was developed into suburban communities. The rising population increased consumer demand and the under-construction interstate freeway promised easy access. In 1970 the site was redeveloped as a shopping mall and Adventist Medical Center. History =Origins and establishment= The Crystal Springs Sanitarium at the top of Mt. Tabor in 1905. The hospital was founded in 1883 by Dr. Henry Waldo Coe. In 1905, Coe purchased a building from the Lewis and Clark Exposition and moved it from the exposition site in Northwest Portland to Mt. Tabor, where it was converted into a psychiatric hospital. Five years later, Dr. Coe moved operations to its final location. During its early years, the hospital went by several names including Dr. Coe's Nervous Sanitarium, Mindease, Mt. Tabor Sanitarium and Crystal Springs Sanitarium. In 1904, Morningside was awarded a contract from the U.S. Department of the Interior to care for mentally ill and mentally handicapped patients from the territory of Alaska, who would constitute the bulk of the hospital's patients throughout its tenure. Patients had previously been sent to the Oregon Insane Asylum. Between 1905 and 1968, nearly 5,000 patients were admitted to Morningside, not including the roughly 40 admitted monthly on behalf of Multnomah County, which used the hospital for emergency care. After Dr. Henry Waldo Coe's death in 1927, Morningside was taken over by his son, Wayne Coe. Although not a medical doctor, Wayne Coe acted as hospital administrator and eventually as Chairman of the Henry Waldo Coe Foundation. =Criticism and decline= In 1955, Morningside came under attack after a bill was introduced by U.S. Rep. Edith Green (D) of Oregon, to transfer care of Alaskan patients to Alaska. Questions of financial impropriety raised during hearings led to an investigation of the hospital by the U.S. General Accounting Office in 1956. By this time, Wayne Coe's son Henry Coe, had entered the family business. The Coes were accused of using hospital funds for personal expenses, including trips to South Africa and Mexico, a beach property in Gearhart and a ranch in Stanfield, Oregon. The Coes were also accused of \\"outrageous abuse of privilege\\" including the use of patient labor for home and hospital building and maintenance, under the guise of occupational therapy. The Coes denied the charges, defended the hospital practices and called the investigation \\"rude, uncivil and insulting.\\" Ultimately, no criminal charges were filed and Morningside was fully reaccredited in 1957. By 1964, Morningside's reputation had recovered to the degree that it was featured in an Oregonian article about its success as an \\"open hospital.\\" Under the open hospital model, patients were controlled through sedatives rather than lock and key. The Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act was passed in 1956 and Alaskan patients began being moved from Morningside to new facilities in their home state. The Coes attempted to reorient the hospital. In 1960 they announced that the \\"transfer of 210 patients from Morningside will enable the Portland psychiatric hospital to begin taking patients locally.\\" The Oregonian reported \\"Hospital officials feel that Morningside's present facilities and rehabilitation programs geared to both mentally ill and mentally retarded can be adapted to private patients with a few changes.\\" Morningside was never able to recover from the loss of Alaskan patients, however, and attempts by Henry Coe to find a buyer who would continue to use the facilities for medical purposes were unsuccessful. In the summer of 1968, the last three patients were discharged and Morningside officially closed. The property was sold to Lenrich Associations, a private contractor, and the hospital grounds were used for the construction of Mall 205.

They are the moderately conservative Old Order Amish group in Kishacoquillas Valley, locally called Big Valley, but still relatively conservative compared with the Amish of other regions. History Amish settled in Mifflin County as early as 1791, coming from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. In the 1840s there were three Amish congregations in the region. In 1849 one district divided from the two others, forming the Byler Amish, the first subgroup in North America that divided because of doctrinal differences. The Peachey Amish emerged from a conflict between two bishops of the remaining districts, Abraham Peachey, and Solomon Beiler, in the 1850s. Beiler was one of several Amish Bishops at that time that had begun to baptize his congregation in streams rather than homes, a practice that did not sit well with Peachey, who preferred the traditional method of house baptism. In 1861, when it became clear that the conflict could not be resolved, the two districts separated, with Peachey's district becoming the Peachey Amish. The group that followed Beiler became Amish Mennonites and eventually Mennonites.Jon Guss: \\"Amish and Mennonite Groups in the Big Valley\\" Belief and practice The Renno Amish have a more relaxed attitude concerning dress and home decoration than other Old Order Amish of the region. Homes are painted white and barns are typically red as in many Amish groups. Half-length curtains and screens are commonly found in homes and indoor plumbing is allowed. Their Ordnung allows men to wear only one suspender, while women wear black bonnets. Because their buggies have black tops they are called \\"black toppers\\". There are also Amish with white (Nebraska Amish) and yellow (Byler Amish) tops in the Big Valley.Jon Guss: \\"Amish and Mennonite Groups in the Big Valley\\" Settlements and congregations In 1900 the Peachey Amish‚Äîi.e., the Renno Amish‚Äîhad 3 districts with 250 members, in 1956 they had 3 districts with 205 members.Mifflin County (Pennsylvania, USA) at gameo.org As of 2000, the Renno Amish had about a dozen church districts primarily in Pennsylvania.

Unlike the schools of the Army Air Forces Training Command (AAFTC), OTU- RTU units were operational units of the four domestic numbered air forces along with I Troop Carrier Command and Air Transport Command, with the mission of final phase training new pilots or crews. Most were disbanded in the Spring of 1944 and replaced by combat crew replacement centers assigned to base units. History When the Army Air Corps began its great expansion program in 1939, no provision for operational training existed outside the combat groups themselves. Graduates of the flying schools were assigned either to fill the requirements of existing combat squadrons or to round out the cadre taken from an older unit to form a new one. Each combat squadron was responsible for training its own personnel in order to meet proficiency standards set by training directives from the GHQ Air Force. This method was developed after World War I, and was used successfully in the peacetime Air Corps of the 1920s and 1930s.Part III, Recruitment & Training, Chapter 18, \\"Combat Crew & Unit Training\\": Craven, Wesley and Cate, James, The Army Air Forces In World War II, Volume Six: \\"Men and Planes\\". New Imprint by the Office of Air Force History Washington, D.C., 1983 However, with war imminent, the number of authorized groups in the Air Corps had risen from twenty-five in April 1939 to eighty-four. With this expansion, the level of experience in all groups had declined sharply, with bad effect on operational training. Although there were other causes for the inefficacy of training, including a shortage of planes and of maintenance services, it was clear enough that the Air Corps could not plan indefinitely upon having enough cadres sufficiently experienced to guarantee prompt lifting of whole units to the desired level of proficiency. =Operational Training Units= Major Robert B. Williams, an Air Corps observer in England between September 1940 and January 1941 who later commanded the Second Air Force and a bombardment division of the Eighth, reported favorably to the Office of the Chief of Air Corps on the merits of the Royal Air Force's operational training unit (OTU) system. The RAF program inspired a proposal in January 1942 by Brig. Gen. Follett Bradley, commanding III Bomber Command, to his superior at Third Air Force that an OTU system be instituted in the Air Force Combat Command (which had the responsibility for training new AAF units) as a means of having sufficient experienced personnel to train newly activated groups while not degrading the proficiency of groups headed for combat. Under the system that had been in place since 1939, so many experienced groups would likely be needed for immediate requirements overseas that a critical shortage of experienced personnel needed to develop new units was inevitable. Adapting from the existing system, Bradley proposed that certain groups be designated \\"parent\\" groups, with an authorized overstrength, to provide cadres for newly activated (or \\"satellite\\") groups and assume responsibility for their organization and training. Fresh graduates of training schools would bring the satellite groups to authorized strength and, in a constantly recurring pattern, also restore the parent group to its overstrength. The plan was largely adopted by AFCC in February 1942 to direct operational training in the Second and Third Air Forces, where the bulk of new units were being activated, but by May the AFCC had been dissolved as an extraneous echelon of command and the OTU system was extended by Headquarters AAF to the First and Fourth Air Forces for training new fighter groups. In its first year the system proved difficult to implement to full effect. Unforeseen emergency demands from the combat theaters for experienced units, an erratic supply of combat-type aircraft for training purposes, and an uneven flow of personnel from the individual training programs produced uneven results that took time and experience to work out. By early 1943, however, the plan was in general operation and became increasingly effective in preparing combat groups for action. In most instances, six months were required after the formation of a group to complete its organization and training. Operational training officially commenced for a new group on the day that the cadre was assigned it from the parent group's overstrength. In 1942 the four continental air forces provided training directives to familiarize key members of cadre with their obligations but these varied from air force to air force. Beginning in 1943, cadre leaders received standardized training through a thirty-day course of instruction at the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) in Orlando, Florida, established in November 1942 partly for this purpose. Cadres for medium and heavy bombardment units were trained by AAFSAT's Bombardment Department, fighter cadres by its Air Defense Department, and light bombardment cadres by the Air Support Department. The AAFSAT course consisted of both an academic and a practical phase. During the academic phase, cadre leaders reviewed problems of command, operations, and intelligence under expert tutelage related to the mission of their group. During the practical phase, the cadre was assigned to an AAFSAT base for 50 hours of operational exercises assisted by the base's demonstration squadron, including simulated combat missions. While practical experience was of value in preparing the cadres, close coordination of the academic and practical phases was sometimes lacking and the exercises also suffered occasionally from a lack of needed equipment. On returning to their assigned OTU stations, the cadres began training with their units, which by this time had usually reached regulation strength. Group instruction was divided in varying proportions between individual and team training but during the final phase both air and ground echelons functioned as nearly as possible as a self-contained combat unit. =Replacement Training Units= While the OTU system was evolving as the most suitable means of training new groups for combat, a plan calling for the establishment of Replacement Training Units (RTUs) as a regular means of providing replacement crews and crew members was also being developed. Until May 1942, when the RTU system was ordered into effect in the continental air forces, replacements for overseas units were procured by withdrawing qualified personnel from regular units stationed in the United States. This method, though simple, followed no orderly plan and jeopardized effective unit training by removing experienced personnel from U.S.-based groups. In order to establish a sounder method of providing combat replacements, AAF Headquarters directed that certain additional groups be listed as training organizations and maintained at an authorized over-strength to serve as reservoirs from which trained individuals and crews could be withdrawn for overseas shipment. As was true of the OTU system, many months were required to place the RTU plan into full operation. By the end of 1943, however, when the formation of new groups (except for B-29 units) was virtually completed, RTU operations had become the major activity of the continental air forces. After 1943 the training organization was modified by the merging of personnel from each fixed RTU group with its air base complement; the resultant unit was designated a combat crew training school or station (CCTS). The RTU system was simpler than the OTU and necessitated few important changes from the traditional organization and administration of combat units. Men designated as replacements were sent to an RTU group (or CCTS), where they received a similar though shorter course than that given in an OTU. Considerably less time was given to integrated activities at the group level, because the trainees of an RTU would not function as a group in combat. As they completed the required phases of training, individuals and crews were drawn from the RTU to serve in established units overseas. During most of the war, OTU-RTU operations were governed by AAF Headquarters through the domestic air forces, I Troop Carrier Command, and Air Transport Command. Under each of the air forces various subordinate commands, wings, and groups issued instructional directives and supervised OTU-RTU activities. Toward the end of the war, some duplication of effort within each air force was eliminated by restricting to the air force headquarters the issuance of training directives and by limiting the functions of intermediate commands to supervision and inspection. =Army Air Forces Base Units= By the spring of 1944 the Army Air Forces had found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit,Craven & Cate, The Organization and its Responsibilities, Chapter 2 The AAF p. 75 while the groups and squadrons acting as RTUs were disbanded or inactivated.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 7 Known as an Army Air Forces Base Units (AAFBU)Usually referred to as ‚ÄúAAF Base Units\\" the units provided flexibility to subordinate headquarters and freed up manpower for overseas service. The goal was to establish one AAFBU on each training base in the Continental United States. Separate additional base units were authorized to provide personnel overhead for wings, regions, and higher echelons. All organizations on the base were designated as sections (later squadrons) of the AAFBU, identified by letters from \\"A\\" to \\"Z\\". Personnel were reassigned to the new sections, and the previous squadrons and groups were inactivated or disbanded.Part I Organization & Its Responsibilities, Chapter 2, \\"The AAF\\"; Craven and Cate, The AAF in World War II To the numerical designation of the AAFBU, the new units carried a parenthetical suffix that indicated the unit‚Äôs function.For example the 223d AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Heavy), which was located at Dyersburg Army Air Field Because AAFBUs were designated, organized, and discontinued by the commands, air forces, and centers, they were in effect major command-controlled (or MAJCON) units, the first of their kind. Most training airfields were closed after the war ended in 1945 and 1946 and the AAFBUs were discontinued. To prevent duplication in designations, each headquarters was assigned a block of numbers to use when numbering its AAFBUs.For example, First Air Force units were numbered from 100 to 199, while Second Air Force used the numbers 200 to 299 for its units. Despite some resistance, the experiment was destined to leave its mark on postwar organization of the United States Air Force (USAF). In September 1947, upon establishment of the USAF, the AAFBUs on permanent Army Air Forces bases became Air Force Base Units (AFBU) upon the base transfer to the USAF. By mid-1948 with the adoption by the USAF of the Hobson Plan Wing- Base organization (as opposed to the AFBU Base organization), the AFBUs were discontinued or redesignated in favor of new USAF four-digit \\"table of distribution units\\" established by USAF or the Major Command. OTU-RTU Training Programs The types of training conducted by each of the continental air forces OTUs/RTUs varied from time to time according to the needs of the war. Bomber and fighter training was assigned to each continental air force. This was done mainly because the facilities of all air forces were needed to turn out the large number of units and personnel required by the overseas combat air forces; it was done also to facilitate joint fighter and bomber exercises in the later stages of unit training.Part III Recruitment & Training, Chapter 18 Combat Crew and Unit Training, \\"The OTU-RTU System\\"; Craven and Cate, The AAF in World War II *The Second Air Force was assigned the principal mission for developing heavy bombardment groups, while the Third Air Force directed light and medium bombardment, reconnaissance, and air support activities. *The responsibility of the First and Fourth Air Forces was chiefly the training of fighter units, although initially after the Pearl Harbor Attack First and Fourth Air Forces were tasked with the coastal air defense and the antisubmarine mission. It wasn't until September 1943 that the antisubmarine mission was transferred to the Navy and their full focus was on training.Shaw, Frederick J. (2014), Locating Air Force Base Sites History‚Äôs Legacy, Air Force History and Museums Program, United States Air Force, Washington DC, 2004. (Updated Edition, 2014) *I Troop Carrier Command and Air Transport Command performed specialized training for air movement of troops and equipment, along with the aircraft ferrying mission. Toward the end of the war the scope of responsibility of each Air Force changed when Second Air Force was assigned the B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment OTU/RTU training mission; subsequently the B-17/B-24 heavy bombardment RTUs were transferred to Third and Forth Air Forces. In order to accommodate this, II Fighter Command took over some P-51 Mustang RTU training from Fourth Air Force and Third Air Force transferred medium and light bomber RTUs along the Atlantic coast to the First Air Force. II Fighter Command concentrated on training P-51 pilots on over-water very long range escorting of B-29 groups and also on the ground attack missions used to strafe Japanese airfields while the B-29s were over the Japanese Home Islands during their bombing attacks. In addition, pilot transition instruction was transferred to AAF Training Command in the interest of accelerating the production of B-29 units. = Bombardment Training Program = Since the heavy bomber was the backbone of the American air offensive, the training of crews and units to man the big planes became the primary task of the OTU-RTU system. Heavy/Medium/Light Bomber Training Program The Second Air Force conducted the major portion of B-17/B-24 heavy bombardment training, and divided it into three principal phases. Until the end of 1943 operational training of each of the phases was usually given at a different base. That arrangement was then abandoned in the change to replacement training in favor of giving the entire program at one station. Medium and light bombardment training, which was conducted almost exclusively by the Third Air Force, was similarly divided. *During the first phase, individual crew members received instruction in their specialties, particular attention being given to instrument and night flying exercises for pilots, cross-country tests for navigators, target runs for bombardiers, and air-to- air firing for gunners. *During the second phase, teamwork of the combat crew was stressed: bombing, gunnery, and instrument flight missions were performed by full crews. *The third phase aimed at developing effective unit operation, the goal of the entire program. It included extensive exercises in high- altitude formation flying, long-range navigation, target identification, and simulated combat missions. Much OTU-RTU instruction was given on the ground-in classrooms, hangars, and on gunnery ranges. Air training was conducted chiefly through informal supervision of flight operations. An experienced navigator, for instance, would accompany a new team on a practice mission. During the course of the trip he would observe the recently graduated navigator, check his techniques, and offer suggestions for improvement. At the conclusion of each mission the ‚Äúinstructor‚Äù would file a report on the progress of the ‚Äústudent.‚Äù Informal teaching of this kind was the rule for other crew positions, too. Tactics involving the coordinated use of crews, or of larger elements, were often demonstrated by experienced crews before the new units attempted them. B-29 Training Program In 1943, B-29 Superfortress OTU training was assigned to the Second Air Force. Although the organization and techniques of instruction were basically similar in all types of bombardment training, certain features were unique to the B-29 program. Since particular attention had to be given to the selection of personnel, the usual policy of filling operational units with recent graduates of AAFTC schools was set aside. Instead, pilots and other crew members were selected from those who already had extensive experience in the operation of multi-engine aircraft. Air Transport Command was planned to be the principal source of pilots and navigators with the desired experience, but relatively few men were transferred from ATC to B-29 training. Instead, instructors in the four-engine schools of Army Air Forces Training Command were to constitute the chief reservoir of experienced and available pilots. The specialized training program began with a five-week curriculum, given prior to crew assignment, for pilots, co-pilots, and flight engineers for the purpose of emphasizing the close teamwork required of these three officers in the operation of a Superfortress. Teams put through this special transition were then assigned to Second Air Force units for integration into full crews. B-29 operational training was divided into the three customary phases but took slightly longer than the B-17/B-24 heavy bombardment training. It was governed by special AAF training standards, which placed increasing emphasis on high-altitude, long- range navigation missions and use of radar equipment. =Fighter Training Program = Operational training for fighter units followed the standard OTU- RTU pattern, but naturally differed from that of bombardment units. Only in night fighter planes (P-61) did the combat crew consist of more than one member, and the overwhelming proportion of fighter pilots served in the single-seater day fighters. Since the problem of crew teamwork did not exist in day fighter training, the program was directed toward maximum individual proficiency and precise coordination among the pilots of each squadron and group. Generally P-47 Thunderbolt OTU-RTU training was provided by First Air Force, while P-38 Lightning Training was conducted by Fourth Air Force. In 1943, P-51 Mustang OTU training replaced the P-38 OTUs, as most P-38 units had been deployed overseas, however P-38 RTU, along with P-51 RTU was provided by Fourth Air Force. As the Southwest Pacific Theater had some P-39 Airacobra squadrons deployed, RTU training was provided also by Fourth Air Force. Although AAFTC eventually gave some transition experience to pilots on combat fighter types, it was generally necessary for First and Fourth Air Force OTU‚Äôs to give transition training on whatever aircraft might be available. Following such familiarization, the pilot was required to fly the aircraft in specified acrobatic, aerial bombing, and gunnery exercises, and in simulated individual combat. Navigation missions, instrument flying, and night flying were also prescribed. Stress was placed, especially after 1943, on high-altitude operations and on the development of combat vigilance and aggressiveness. Unit as well as individual instruction was limited by the pressure of time during the first part of the war. Within the hours available, the greatest attention was paid to take-off and assembly procedures, precision landings in quick succession, formation flying under varying conditions, and the execution of offensive and defensive tactics against air and surface forces, Along with these came instruction on how to maintain aircraft in the field, on procedures for movement to a new base, and on necessary administrative and housekeeping activities. Air-Ground Support/Anti-Aircraft Defensive Training  Deficiencies in air-ground teamwork were strikingly revealed in the North African Campaign, and steps were taken in 1943 to provide more effective combined training of air and ground forces. The I and II Air Support Commands were specifically directed to develop appropriate exercises in cooperation with Army ground infantry and armored units. Light and Medium bombardment, fighter, and observation units, after completing their regular training, were assigned when possible to one of these commands for the desired combined training before deployment overseas. The results of this training became evident after the D-Day landings in France; the Italian Campaign and in the Pacific, the New Guinea campaign; the Philippines Campaign, and the Battle of Okinawa. Joint exercises between air and anti-aircraft units took the form chiefly of defense against simulated bombardment attacks, and involved the use of fighters, searchlight units, antiaircraft artillery, and aircraft warning systems. By the end of 1943 exercises of this kind were being conducted in the First, Third, and Fourth Air Forces. Heavy Bomber Escort Training It was not too long after its commitment to battle that the Eighth Air Force found that unescorted bombardment meant prohibitive losses. The need was for more training in fighter-bomber cooperation. Such exercises had been carried on to a limited degree before the war, but during the first year after the Pearl Harbor attack they were dropped because of the lack of time. Early in 1943 the Second and Fourth Air Forces began to provide joint fighter-bomber training as part of defense maneuvers on the Pacific coast. These maneuvers, in which the Navy participated, were simulated attacks by carrier-launched aircraft on various coastal cities. Bomber units with fighter escort sought out the vessels and on the return flight provided targets for interception by fighter units. Since reports from combat theaters continued to stress the need for better teamwork between fighters and bombers on cooperative missions, and for more effective defensive action by bombers against hostile interceptors, the AAF undertook in the fall of 1943 to increase the amount of joint fighter/bomber training and to systematize the program in all the continental air forces. In order to provide a necessary basis for combined training in all of the domestic air forces, heavy bombardment OTU‚Äôs were established in the First and Fourth Air Forces, which had formerly been restricted to fighter units, while fighter OTU‚Äôs were activated in the Second Air Force, which had formerly been restricted to bombers. The Third Air Force was already engaged in both types of training on a scale sufficient to permit effective combined exercises. =Night Fighter Training Program = : further information: 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group Specialized training in night fighter tactics began in March 1942 upon return of Air Corps observers in England prior to the United States entry into World War II. Upon review of the recommendations presented by the observers, the Air Defense Operational Training Unit was established by Third Air Force on 26 March; it was re- designated as the Interceptor Command School on 30 March. Initially established at Key Field, Mississippi, the school was moved to Orlando Army Air Base, Florida where it became part of the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT).Northrop P-61 Black Widow‚ÄîThe Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R. Pape, John M. Campbell and Donna Campbell, Motorbooks International, 1991. By July 1942, the school received a B-18 Bolo and a number of Douglas P-70 Havocs to initiate the program. By the end of September, AAFSAT had re-designated the program as the Night Fighter Department (Dark). In October, the first two dedicated night fighter training squadrons, the 348th and 349th Night Fighter Squadrons were formed. In January 1943 the school was expanded from Orlando to Kissimmee Army Airfield due to the expansion of AAFSAT and the Fighter Command School. At Kissimmee, the first operational squadrons were activated and Operational Training was carried out by the 348th and 349th. British Bristol Beaufighter night fighters were received for those squadrons programmed for service in Europe. Each squadron was manned with graduates of Training Command advanced flying schools and received eight weeks of training in the two-engine Beaufighters or P-70s. On 1 April 1943, AAFSAT expanded the Night Fighter Division, placing it under the Air Defense Department, and transferred all training from the Night Fighter Section to the new Division. Beginning in May 1943, orders from HQ AAF were received that the training needed to be expanded to accommodate one new night fighter squadron per month. The school at Kissimmee was expanded with a third OTU, the 420th Night Fighter Squadron at Dunnellon Army Air Field. With the expansion of the Night Fighter Training Division, tasks were divided into three major functions. The 348th NFS at Orlando AAB provided the initial Operational Training for new Training Command pilots. The 349th at Kissimmee AAF carried out 2-engine transition training, while the 420th at Dunnellon AAF provided Replacement Training (RTU). On 15 July 1943, the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group was activated to give the school better organizational structure. In September, the first American-built dedicated night fighter began to arrive, the Northrup YP-61 Black Widow. The YP-61 and a few production P-61As were assigned to the school for both the training programs as well as flight-testing of various torrent/gun configurations. Also a second RTU was established in November when the 424th Night Fighter Squadron was formed. With the arrival of the P-61 Black Widow, it was decided to move the school to California to be closer to the Northrup manufacturing plant at Hawthorne. The 481st NFOTU and its training squadrons were moved to Hammer Field, near Fresno California on 1 January 1944 and were placed under Fourth Air Force IV Fighter Command. The 319th Wing, activated on 1 April took over the duties of the 481st, disbanding the group and all of its squadrons on 31 March. It was replaced by the 450th Army Air Forces Base Unit as the P-61 RTU, and the squadron designations replaced by letters (A, B, C, D). Night Fighter RTU training continued until the end of August 1945 when the school at Hammer Field was inactivated with the end of the war in the Pacific. = Reconnaissance Training = Just before the Pearl Harbor attack, Air Corps reconnaissance aviation strength included several reconnaissance squadrons and a single photographic group.Part III Recruitment & Training, Chapter 18 Combat Crew and Unit Training, \\"Reconnaissance Training\\"; Craven and Cate, The AAF in World War II *The observation units, equipped with light, slow aircraft, were used for short-range missions in cooperation with ground forces and were assigned to the air support commands of each air force. *The reconnaissance units on the other hand, were each attached to a bombardment group and equipped with aircraft of the type assigned to the group. These reconnaissance squadrons, primarily equipped with B-17 Flying Fortresses were to serve primarily as the eyes of the unit and secondarily as bombardment organizations, but in April 1942 all such units were re-designated as bombardment squadrons in anticipation of the assignment of separate photographic groups to the theaters. The 1st Photographic Group had been created in June 1941 to expand photo-mapping activities in the AAF and to conduct long-range photo reconnaissance after the pattern developed by the British. Each of the four squadrons of the group was assigned to one of the continental air forces. However, the 1st Photographic Group found almost no opportunity for training because as each of its squadrons was busily engaged overseas in carrying out mapping missions for hemisphere defense. It was not until May 1942 that the 2d Photographic Group was established for the purpose of instructing new photographic crews. After numerous conferences and deliberations, the British model of organization and tactics was adopted. Appropriate OTU-RTU training for production of the new tactical reconnaissance groups was instituted shortly thereafter at Key Field, Mississippi. Photo reconnaissance instruction was similarly affected by British experience. Although the AAF was familiar with the techniques of aerial photography before the war, it learned a great deal from British methods. The commanding officer at Peterson Field, Colorado, who was responsible for initiating the first photo reconnaissance OTU training in 1942, had spent several months in England studying RAF organization and procedures, and his experience there had considerable influence upon the content of the AAF instructional program. From 1943 until the close of the war reconnaissance operational training was concentrated in the Third Air Force. The OTU-RTU system was followed, as in the case of fighter and bombardment unit training, though it hardly became effective before the program was reduced to production of replacement crews. *Tactical reconnaissance pilots were required by the training standards to demonstrate navigational skill over land and water, as well as ability to fly on instruments and in all types of formations. They were called upon to perform nearly every defensive and offensive maneuver expected of fighter pilots and were required in addition to master the techniques of artillery adjustment and aerial photography. *The liaison pilot held an aviation rating restricting him to the operation of small, low-powered aircraft; he was usually the graduate of a special Training Command course, briefer than that for a standard pilot. As members of a unit, liaison pilots had to fly formations and execute desired missions in support of ground forces. These included such activities as limited reconnaissance, courier service, aerial wire laying, artillery adjustment, and air evacuation. An exception were the Air Commando liaison pilots of the 1st, 2d and 3d Air Commando Groups that were deployed to the CBI and to the Philippines. These pilots were specially trained by Third Air Force for combat maneuvers due to their unique missions. = Troop Carrier Training = Troop Carrier units had the unique mission of dropping airborne parachute units behind enemy lines, along with towing gliders for landing behind enemy lines as the spearheads of invasions and other major ground offensives. Also specially trained ground soldiers did the fighting after the landings, and it was the responsibility of the AAF to make the deliveries of men and supplies.Part III Recruitment & Training, Chapter 18 Combat Crew and Unit Training, \\"Troop Carrier Training\\"; Craven and Cate, The AAF in World War II To carry out these responsibilities was the mission of AAF troop carrier units, serving under theater or task force commanders in cooperation with ground force elements. The training of these units, which had to be able to perform all phases of airborne operations, was the function of I Troop Carrier Command. It was originally activated in April 1942, with the designation of Air Transport Command. Troop carrier headquarters was located throughout the war at Stout Field, Indianapolis, Indiana. The OTU-RTU system of operational training, used in the fighter and bombardment programs, was also adopted for troop carrier instruction. The task performed by I Troop Carrier Command, while quantitatively smaller than that of other domestic air forces, was nevertheless substantial. In addition to the transport crews, which normally consisted of pilot, co-pilot, navigator, radio operator, and aerial engineer, some 5,000 glider pilots were prepared for their special function. Following the period of operational training, or during the final portion of it, troop carrier units engaged in combined exercises with elements of the Airborne Command (Army Ground Forces). These realistic maneuvers, which lasted for about two months, were divided into three phases. The first consisted of small-scale operations in which a company of ground soldiers was transported. The scale of movement was increased in the second period, and during the final phase whole divisions were moved as units over distances up to 300 miles. In each stage of combined training the troop carrier groups placed emphasis upon single-and double-tow of gliders under combat conditions and upon night operations. Attention was given to all types of airborne assignments, including resupply and evacuation by air. By the end of 1944 it was decided to restrict glider instruction to rated power pilots, because they were available in sufficient numbers and could serve a dual purpose in troop carrier units. = Ferry Pilots and Transport Crews = Probably no other AAF agency had to fly so many different models of aircraft as the Air Transport Command. Its Air Transportation Division depended chiefly upon two models: the steady C-47 Skytrain and the larger, more commodious C-54 Skymaster. However another part of its mission was to provide crews for the ferrying of combat models from factories to points of transfer to specified foreign governments, to AAF bases at home, and eventually to combat areas overseas, This second mission was the responsibly of the ATC Ferrying Division.Part III Recruitment & Training, Chapter 20 Other Training Programs, \\"Ferry Pilots and Transport Crews\\"; Craven and Cate, The AAF in World War II Air Transportation Division Air transport activity developed as a service primarily to overseas areas, a service which at first was performed largely by the commercial airlines operating under contract with the AAF. By an agreement of July 1942 the airlines established an Airlines War Training Institute as a means of guaranteeing a continuing supply of crews, a but the number thus trained fell short of the need, and the Air Transportation Division of ATC in time had to rely on military personnel. To provide training for use of its own planes and for the special requirements of its far-flung operations, the division began operating an OTU in 1942, drawing on the graduates of the Training Command advanced two and four-engine flight schools. In the fall of 1943 the Ferrying Division assumed full responsibility for all ATC pilot training. Ferrying Division Ferrying Division found it necessary to provide transition instruction on many planes, in the hope that pilots could qualify on all major U.S. models. A transition school had been established at the Long Beach Army Air Field ferrying base in California as early as July 1941; others were set up in the spring of 1942 at Boeing Field, Seattle, Berry Field, Nashville, Romulus Army Airfield, Detroit, Baltimore Municipal Airport, Maryland, and at Hensley Field, Dallas. When the Ferrying Division assumed responsibility for all ATC training in October 1943, it established three OTU‚Äôs, and a night and instrument training school at Rosecrans Field, Missouri. The OTU school at Homestead Army Air Field, Florida was a four- engine transport school. The Reno Army Air Base, Nevada OTU specialized on training C-47 and C-46 pilots for China-India operations, flying \\"The Hump\\" across the Himalayan Mountains. Although Homestead and Reno conducted full transport crew training, graduation of students was on an individual, rather than crew, basis. A specialized fighter transition OTU for the ATC Ferrying Division was established at Palm Springs Army Airfield, California in November 1943, however it was moved in the spring of 1944 to Brownsville Army Airfield, Texas. Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPS) When the pilots of the Women‚Äôs Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron began to deliver airplanes for the ATC, their activities were limited almost entirely to training and liaison aircraft. During 1943 and 1944 these restrictions were eased, and women pilots were given transition on high-powered types under the same standards of experience and by the same methods as applied to male pilots.Part III Recruitment & Training, Chapter 20 Other Training Programs, \\"The WASPS\\"; Craven and Cate, The AAF in World War II The number of women pilots assigned to the Ferrying Division reached its peak of 303 in April 1944. But by the time they were ready to replace a substantial number of men, in keeping with the original purpose of their organization, victories overseas brought a reduction in military requirements for pilots. Toward the end of 1944 the Women Airforce Service Pilots were accordingly disbanded.

The purpose of the operation was to carry out attacks on enemy shipping on the coast of Norway between latitudes 64¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ and 69¬∞ North. The operation took place under the personal command of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, Admiral Sir Henry Ruthven Moore, flying his flag in the aircraft carrier . It is remembered for the destruction of in Norway's worst disaster at sea. The force consisted of two groups, designated Force 7 and Force 8.

After three years of conflict in Northern Ireland, Annette became the 100th civilian to be killed in the Troubles. No individual has been charged with her death. Early life Annette lived with her parents, four brothers and two sisters, in Drumcliffe Avenue in the Bogside. She was pupil at St. Cecilia's College in Derry. Her siblings recall her as an artistic, bubbly and good natured teen. Her younger sister, May, believes Annette would have become a nurse.Children of the Troubles: The Untold Story of the Children Killed in the Northern Ireland Conflict p. 27 On 6 September, all pupils at Annette's school had been allowed to leave early due to ongoing rioting in and around the Little Diamond area of the Bogside. Annette and several of her friends had gathered to collect the rubber bullets that inevitably littered the ground in such melees.

May relayed this news to her mother, who exclaimed: \\"God help that poor girl and her mother and father, whoever they are.\\" Father Edward Daly, who gave McGavigan the last rites, later recollected: \\"I saw a young girl lying on the ground with an ice-cream beside her. She had been hit in the head and was on the point of death. I gave her the last rites and then had to break the news to her mother, who collapsed. It was very difficult. It made a very powerful impression on me.\\" At the time of Annette's death, British soldiers were positioned in the grounds of the old post office between the Little Diamond and Frederick Street; confronting a number of rioting youths in the Little Diamond, Fahan Street and Eglinton Place area. Despite continued efforts by Annette's family to pursue inquests relating to the circumstances and culpability of her death, no individual has ever been charged or brought to trial in relation to Annette's death.Death of a Derry Schoolgirl - The Irish Archives The Ministry of Defence has refused to release intelligence documentation relating to her death. Nonetheless, her family have vowed they will continue to fight for justice. After repainting in 2006 Legacy Annette is the subject of a Bogside mural entitled \\"The Death of Innocence.\\" This mural is located on the gable wall of a maisonnette on the junction of Lecky Road and Westland Street, close to Free Derry Corner. The mural was originally unveiled on Wednesday 1 September 1999, and depicts Annette in her school uniform with an encircled, partly coloured butterfly to the above right of her head. To Annette's right is a broken rifle, red in colour, pointing downwards and enlocked by the colour white. In June 2006 the mural was repainted with the butterfly coloured in and the rifle redrawn broken, reflecting the futility of continued armed activity.Death Of Innocence - The Annette McGavigan Mural See also * Bogside Artists * The Troubles in Derry  References  External links  McGavigan family appeal for witnesses * The Death of Innocence Mural - The Bogside & Creggan Estate Category:1957 births Category:1971 deaths Category:1971 in Northern Ireland Category:Conflicts in 1971 Category:Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland Category:People from Derry (city) Category:The Troubles in Derry (city) ","title":"Annette McGavigan"},{"id":"42419188","text":"Scott E.

Funded entirely by contributions from JAMS neutrals and staff, the JAMS Foundation has provided nearly $5 million in grants for conflict resolution initiatives. The JAMS Foundation also established the Weinstein International Fellowship Program to provide opportunities for individuals from outside the United States to visit the U.S. and learn more about dispute resolution processes and practices and to pursue a project of their own to advance dispute resolution in their home countries.

Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains. Japan is the third-largest market for KFC after China and the United States with 1,165 outlets as of December 2014. In Japan, 70 percent of sales are takeout, with customers tending to buy fried chicken for parties and other special occasions and eating it as a side dish. History KFC Japan was originally formed as a joint venture between the American parent and the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation. Following four years of negotiations, Mitsubishi was awarded the franchise rights to KFC in Japan, and a test store was opened at the Osaka World Expo in March 1970. After the debut proved successful, the first proper store was opened in the suburban location of Nagoya in November 1970. The American parent wanted suburban locations, whereas Mitsubishi argued for city centre locations, as cars had not been widely adopted in Japan at that time. Two more locations were opened in Osaka, but the stores struggled, and after less than a year of operation, had lost JP¬• 100 million. As a result of this failure, Mitsubishi's original plan for urban locations was pursued. The first outlet under the new approach opened in 1972 in Kobe, an upmarket residential area with a large Western expatriate community. The strategy was a success, and by December 1973, 100 outlets had been opened. Harland Sanders himself visited the Japanese operations in 1972, 1978 and 1980. In 1983 there were 390 outlets with annual sales just under $300 million. By this time Japan was KFC's largest single foreign market. In August 1990, KFC Japan was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. KFC benefited from the economic boom in Japan during the 1980s, and grew to 1,000 outlets with annual sales of $1.2 billion by 1993. However, the rapid expansion of outlets saw franchisees competing for market shares with each other, and around 100 outlets closed down in the mid-1990s. In 2000, KFC Japan reported sales of nearly $598 million. In December 2007, Mitsubishi assumed majority control of KFC Japan in a JP¬• 14.83 billion transaction. = Christmas = In 1970, Takeshi Okawara‚Äîmanager of the first KFC restaurant in Japan‚Äîbegan promoting fried chicken \\"party barrels\\" as a Christmas meal intended to serve as a substitute for the traditional American turkey dinner. Okawara marketed the party barrels as a way to celebrate Christmas, a holiday which lacked widespread traditions in Japan at the time. KFC Japan expanded the promotion nationwide in 1974 with its long running \\"Kentucky for Christmas\\" () or \\"Kentucky Christmas\\" () advertising campaign. Eating KFC food as a Christmas time meal has since become a widely practised custom in Japan. , in Japan, Christmas sales of KFC made around Christmas Eve account for nearly five per cent of annual revenue.

Shortly after Sundberg‚Äôs death, another of his cherished initiatives finally came to fruition: a report was published by a Working Group of Americans living in Switzerland, which had organized a series of widely attended Town Hall Meetings held in different Swiss cities earlier in 2012. This extensive and impassioned review of how various U.S. policies impact citizens abroad was aimed at getting these issues onto the radar screens of Washington policy- makers.

Battin began his career in 1951, serving as the assistant director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äôs (MIT) Instrumentation Laboratory. Battin left the laboratory in 1956, becoming a senior staff member at Arthur Little Inc., but returned to MIT‚Äôs Instrumentation Laboratory in 1958. He subsequently became the technical director of the Apollo Mission Development program, as well as associate director of the laboratory. Under Battin‚Äôs leadership, his team created the analytic and software design of the navigation, guidance and control systems for each of the Apollo spaceflights, making the lunar landing of Apollo 11 possible. In 1973, the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory became the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory Inc., where Battin served as the associate head of the NASA Program Department. After his retirement from Draper in 1987, Battin continued to teach at MIT, where he was a senior lecturer in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics until 2010.

A literary critic and historian of literature, he was also a poet, and made sensation at the Sorbonne attacking the theories of Hippolyte Taine in his thesis about Robert Burns in 1893.  Biography and career  = Early life and education = Auguste Angellier was born on 1 July 1848 in Dunkerque in the department of Nord, to a carpenter father and a secretary mother. He was educated in Boulogne-sur-Mer after the precocious death of his father. His attachment to this town had never denied. He then prepared the contest of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris in 1866. During the written and oral test of the exam, he was rejected from the high school by the head teacher who considers him, wrongly by others, as a leader of a rebellion movement concerning the bad quality of the food. This disastrous episode of his education forced him to leave to England, due to a lack of financial resources, where he received a job offer of a teacher in a small boarding school. = Early career and later training = Engaged as a volunteer during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he moved to Lyon and then to Bordeaux. A serious breathing infection forced him to go back to Paris, during the Commune, and at the end of the war, he was named repeater at the Lyc√©e Louis-Descartes. He was finally allowed to enter in the Instruction Publique. He graduated soon after. Accepted at a certificate for English teaching, two years later, he taught as a repeater for three years, a required period at that time before registering to prepare the agr√©gation. He graduated with this contest at the age of 28, and taught right after at the Lyc√©e Charlemagne in Paris, until his departure to England in 1878. = Poetry and English teaching = Angellier cultivated numerous literary friendships, and developed his sensitivity as a poet. His reputation came better in his academic work than in his poetry work. Until that period, he hesitated between journalism and teaching, but this leave just accorded to him permitted him to become interested at the reform project in the study of modern languages in France, through the study of the system in the English universities. In 1881, a job of Ma√Ætre de conf√©rences in Douai, gave him the opportunity of a brilliant career as an English teacher (the Facult√© de Lettres of Douai was transferred to Lille in 1887). Twelve years later, he made two thesis, each one dedicated to a poet : the major thesis to Scottish poet Robert Burns, and an additional thesis to John Keats, entirely written in Latin. Even the quotations of the poems by Keats were written in Latin. Since then, Angellier held the title of professor. He was also the president of the jury at the agr√©gation of English from 1890 to 1904, and since February 1897, he became the dean with several responsibilities. In 1902, he returned as a Ma√Ætre de conf√©rences at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and went back to Lille in 1904.  Death  Auguste Angellier died on February 28, 1911 in Boulogne- sur-Mer.

In March 2020, at the conclusion of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2020, she became the world's number one batter in Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) cricket. Domestic career At the domestic level, Mooney plays as a wicket-keeper/batter for Queensland Fire and the Brisbane Heat. She hopes eventually to succeed Alyssa Healy as the national team's first choice wicket- keeper. In November 2018, Mooney was named in Brisbane Heat's squad for the 2018‚Äì19 Women's Big Bash League season (WBBL04). During the final of the WBBL04 tournament, held on a sweltering Australia Day 2019, she overcame a dizziness-inducing illness to score a player of the match-winning 65 runs from 46 balls. Her innings inspired the Heat to its maiden Women's Big Bash title, with a three-wicket victory over the heavily favoured Sydney Sixers. International career Mooney was a member of the victorious Southern Stars squad that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 title in Bangladesh. Mooney played her first game for the Australia women's national cricket team in a Twenty20 match against India on 26 January 2016 at the Adelaide Oval.

In the final, Mooney top-scored for Australia, finishing unbeaten on 78 off 54 balls to help Australia win their fifth title. Mooney also finished as the tournament's leading runs scorer with 259 runs, including the most fours (30), and was named player of the tournament.

It stands at the widest part of a narrow gorge through which a little river named Bistrica flows. The earliest mention of the monastery is found in a chronicle dated to the second half of the 15th century. During the 17th century, the monks of Liplje were active in transcribing religious books. At some point during the Great Turkish War (1683‚Äì1699), the monastery was burned down by the Ottomans. Surviving monks fled north across the Sava River and found refuge in the Orahovica Monastery in Slavonia. They brought with them a number of their manuscript books, which thus became part of the Orahovica library. Unlike the nearby Stuplje Monastery, Liplje was not razed to the ground. Its church was partially repaired so that it could serve as the parish church for the surrounding area. After Ottoman authorities permitted it, the church was restored between 1867 and 1879. The works were mostly funded through donations by the Serb population of the area. Remains of the church's old frescoes were carefully collected and buried beside its wall. In 1922, a bell tower was added at its western side. Almost three hundred years after the monastic community ceased to exist at the church, the Liplje Monastery was re- established in 1965. It was renovated in the 1980s, when the bell tower was removed.

However, instead of disbanding the surplus units, it was decided to amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in renumbering and renaming of the entire cavalry line. The 14th Murray's Jat Lancers and 15th Lancers (Cureton's Multanis) were amalgamated at Sialkot on 21 September 1920 to form 20th Lancers. The new class composition of the regiment was one squadron each of Seraiki, Punjabi Muslims, Jat Sikhs and Hindu Seraiki. The uniform of 20th Lancers was dark blue with scarlet facings. The badge consisted of crossed silver lances bearing pennons with a crown at the intersection above \\"XX\\" and a scroll below. The regiment was in the 7th Cavalry Group based at Delhi.Nath p407 In 1937, when the number of cavalry stations was reduced, 20th Lancers became the training regiment of 3rd Indian Cavalry Group at Lucknow. Its associated regiments were the 6th DCO Lancers, 7th Cavalry, 8th KGV Own, Royal Deccan Lancers (9th Horse), 19th KGO Lancers, and the Central India Horse. A Jat squadron from the Lancers passed to the 6th Lancers. About this time the Indian cavalry began the process of changing from horses to armoured vehicles but the process was slow. The war speeded up the process and the Lancers became part of the new Indian Armoured Corps.Nath p408 It was converted into a training centre in 1940 and transferred to India after Partition of India.Sandhu, Maj Gen GS.

She served primarily as an ocean convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Montreal, Quebec. Montreal was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 23 December 1942 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal and launched 12 June 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 12 November 1943 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in the vicinity of Halifax, Montreal joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force convoy escort group C-4 in March 1944. On 3 September 1944, she rescued 33 survivors from the Fjordheim, a Norwegian merchant that had been torpedoed north of Ireland. She remained with the group until late September 1944 when she joined escort support group EG 26, forming at Derry. She rescued the survivors of that had wrecked southwest of Land's End on 17 December 1944. Montreal remained in the waters surrounding the United Kingdom until March 1945. During this time she was based out of Plymouth and Portsmouth. In mid- March 1945, she returned to Canada and on 31 March she began a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. The refit was completed at Shelburne, Nova Scotia in August and Montreal performed several duties around Halifax until 15 October 1945, when she was paid off. She was placed in reserve at Bedford Basin and remained there until 1947 when she was sold for scrap and taken to Sydney, Nova Scotia. References Notes References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

SQZBiotech¬Æ. Retrieved on 2014-05-18. It is an alternative method to electroporation or cell-penetrating peptides and operates similarly to a french cell press that temporarily disrupts cells, rather than completely bursting them.  Method  The cell- disrupting change in pressure is achieved by passing cells through a narrow opening in a microfluidic device. The device is made up of channels etched into a wafer through which cells initially flow freely. As they move through the device, the channel width gradually narrows. The cell's flexible membrane allows it to change shape and become thinner and longer, allowing it to squeeze through. As the cell becomes more and more narrow, it shrinks in width by about 30 to 80 percent its original size and the forced rapid change in cell shape temporarily creates holes in the membrane, without damaging or killing the cell. While the cell membrane is disrupted, target molecules that pass by can enter the cell through the holes in the membrane. As the cell returns to its normal shape, the holes in the membrane close. Virtually any type of molecule can be delivered into any type of cell.Researchers put squeeze on cells to deliver. Rdmag.com (2013-07-22). Retrieved on 2014-05-18. The throughput is approximately one million per second. Mechanical disruption methods can cause fewer gene expression changes than electrical or chemical methods. This can be preferable in studies that require the gene expression to be controlled at all times.  Applications  Like other cell permeablisation techniques, it enables intracellular delivery materials, such as proteins, siRNA, or carbon nanotubes. The technique has been used for over 20 cell types, including embryonic stem cells and na√Øve immune cells. Initial applications focused on immune cells, for example delivering: * Anti-HIV siRNAs for blocking HIV infection in CD4+ T cells. * Whole protein antigen and enabling MHC class I processing/presentation in polyclonal B cells, facilitating B cell-based vaccine approaches.  Commercialization  The process was originally developed in 2013 by Armon Sharei and Andrea Adamo, in the lab of Langer and Jensen at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2014 Sharei founded SQZBiotech¬Æ to demonstrate the technology.

Mandhana was the only Indian player to be named in the ICC Women's Team of the Year 2016. Mandhana came into the team for the 2017 World Cup after recovering from an injury she sustained, an anterior cruciate ligament rupture, during her time at the WBBL in January that year. In her five-month recovery period, she missed the World Cup Qualifier and the Quadrangular Series in South Africa. She began the World Cup with a 90 against England in Derby, in the first of the group matches.

Smriti Mandhana scored the fastest fifty for India in Women‚Äôs T20Is of just 24 balls against New Zealand in February 2019. In March 2018, she also scored the fifty for India in a Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) fixture, taking 30 balls to reach a half-century against Australia women in the 2017‚Äì18 India women's Tri-Nation Series. The following month, she was named the player of the series, for the three WODI matches played against England women. On 3 August 2018, she scored the first century in the 2018 Women's Cricket Super League. In October 2018, she was named in India's squad for the Women's World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies. Ahead of the tournament, she was named as the star of the team. During the tournament, she became the third cricketer for India to score 1,000 runs in WT20I matches. She ended that year as the leading run-scorer in WODIs with 669 at an average of 66.90. She was adjudged the ICC Women's Cricketer of the Year and the ICC Women's ODI Player of the Year. In February 2019, she was named as the captain of India's Women T20I squad for the three match against England. She became the youngest T20I captain for India when she led the women's team against England in the first T20I in Guwahati. At 22 years and 229 days, the India women's cricket team opener is taking over from Harmanpreet Kaur, who has been ruled out of the three-match series with an ankle injury. In May 2019, she has won the International Woman Cricketer of the Year awards at CEAT International Cricket Awards 2019. In November 2019, during the series against the West Indies, she became the third-fastest cricketer, in terms of innings, to score 2,000 runs in WODIs, doing so in her 51st innings.

She plays for the national cricket team as a right-arm medium pacer and middle-order batter, and is an IAF air traffic control officer. Pandey made her international Twenty20 (T20) debut on 9 March 2014 against Bangladesh at Cox's Bazar cricket stadium in Bangladesh. In August of the same year, she made her One Day International cricket (ODI) and Test cricket debuts against England at Wormsley and Scarborough, respectively. Early life Pandey did her schooling under the Central Board of Secondary Education, India. At the age of 15, she became the first player affiliated with state board to represent India. Within months of this affiliation and getting introduced into the formal set-up, Surekha Bhandare, former Mumbai player and selector, saw her playing and believed that Pandey had all the markings of a future India player. \\"The raw talent in her was hard to go unnotice,\\" Bhandare was quoted stating. In the class-ten board (secondary school) exams, she won the state-wide third rank. It was then that she decided to focus more on studies and cricket took a back seat for the next three years. It was not before her second year as an undergraduate in Electronics and Electrical Engineering that she begun pursuing the sport with serious intent. Academics has always been important to Pandey and had to juggle cricket and college, where she would spend her morning doing gym sessions and academic work, and her afternoons would include a 12km journey to Mapusa so she could train under Nitin Vernekar, former Goa cricketer and Sports Authority of Goa coach. This phase was very crucial to her growth as a cricketer as being the only girl at the boy's facility facing U-16 and U-19 boys honed her reaction time against pace bowling. However, she did not let her focus on game affect her academic performance. She particularly credits Ujwala Phadte, her lecturer in Applied Mathematics for helping her through out this phase and making sure her grades were not inversely proportional to her on-field performance. After completing her engineering degree from Goa College of Engineering in 2010, three multinational companies offered her opportunities, but she declined all these placement offers and decided to take a year off and focus on her cricketing career completely. In July 2011, she joined Indian Air Force, and in June 2012 was commissioned as an air traffic controller. Cricket career At the age of 15, Pandey was selected to play for Goa in 2004. Later at the age of 17 for the 2007‚Äì08 domestic season, she was selected to play for Goa's Women Senior State Side. In the inter-state two-day tournament, Rani Jhansi Trophy, she picked up a four-wicket haul. This was also her Goa senior women's debut. Thirushi Kamini, then already an Indian international, was her first wicket which was a caught-and-bowled. What fast- tracked her selection into the zonal squad the same season was her scoring three half-centuries for the Goa Under-19 side. In her year off from her engineering course and Pandey played in Board President's XI against the visiting England and West Indies teams in 2010 and January 2011 respectively and also took her first \\"international wicket, albeit unofficial,\\" Charlotte Edwards in the 2010 tour game. She continued to play for Goa and after 2013‚Äì14 season of Inter-State T20 tournament (Plate group) she was selected for India's tour of Bangladesh consisting 3 friendly matches with Bangladesh and 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20. After Dilip Sardesai, she is the first player from Goa to play for any Indian national team. She is also the first Goa Cricket Association affiliated cricketer to play international level cricket for India. She is the first Goa-born player to play ODIs and international T20s and 2nd player to play Test cricket, after Saredesai, thus becoming first cricketer to have played both state level cricket for Goa and international level cricket for India. After the T20 World Cup, she played one-off Test match and 2 ODI matches against England. She was instrumental in India's win against South Africa on 26 November 2014. She took 3 wickets and scored 59 runs.

This sanctuary has a connection with Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve through the forest along Wainganga river. The sanctuary is home to resident breeding tigers, herds of Gaur, wild dogs and rare animals like flying squirrels, pangolins and honey badgers. It is bounded roughly by the Wainganga river and the Gose Khurd Dam on the northeast, State Highway 9 and Bhiwapur Town on the south, Umred on the west and a narrow 10 km long range of 600 ‚Äì 800 m hills to the northwest. It is located 40 km north of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve and 50 km southwest of Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary & 60 km from Nagpur, Maharashtra. Pench Tiger Reserve is 80 km to the northwest The number of tourists is increasing because it is very close to the Umred and Nagpur city. Tigers are commonly seen here by many villages around the sanctuary. Wildlife According to a 2014 report in the India Times, 11 tigers, six leopards are in the sanctuary, in addition to wild dogs, sloth bears, bisons, nilgais, deer and sambars. In 2009, Umred- Karhandla was identified as having a good source population of tigers. Fauna Mammal species such as the Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Indian bison, blue bull, chital, sambar deer, barking deer, mouse deer, monkey, wild boar, sloth bear, and wild dog live here. ;Tigers The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimated the presence of three tigers in and around the sanctuary but the number has increased to five, with three new cubs sighted in March 2011. The field director of Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary said the 2011 births seemed to be the first litter of this tigress. \\"Better protection, good prey base and availability of water are three key factors why Bor is becoming a safe haven for tigers,\\" As per the 2015-16 tiger estimation report, there are five or six tigers in the Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary. ;Birds There are more than 90 species of birds belonging to 22 families of 12 different orders recorded in the sanctuary. This includes over 10 species of migratory birds and over seven species of endangered birds. ;Reptiles The reserve is home to over 19 species of reptiles belonging to nine families, of which four species are endangered, namely, Indian cobra, Russell‚Äôs viper, Indian rock python, Indian rat snake, Chequered keelback and monitor lizard.  Tourism and conservation  The sanctuary provides connectivity between key tiger reserves like Tadoba, Pench, Bor and Nagzira. It thus also serves to reduce pressure of tourists and tourist-related activities from those protected areas because they are more eco-sensitive. Several water management programs have been created by the tiger protection NGO Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). About 100 km of motorable road have been developed, out of which tourists are allowed on 44 km. The road can handle about 40 vehicles - 20 in the morning and 20 in the evening. The Forest Department has trained about 20 villagers from the nearby and surrounding areas as guides which provides them employment. The main entrance of the sanctuary is at Karhandla village. The following statistics pertain to the 2013-14 tourist season from 16 October to 28 February: *7,504 tourists (1,454 vehicles) visited Umred-Karhandla. *17,215 tourists (3,455 vehicles) visited Pench National Park. *6,551 tourists (1,190 vehicles) visited Bor Wildlife Sanctuary. Recently, there has been sharp drop in ecotourism in the sanctuary. This has been attributed to disappearance of Jai (the iconic tiger), ban on private vehicles & doubling of gate fee.

Hera's face is modelled on Rubens' wife, H√©l√®ne Fourment. The carriage is pulled by Hera's favourite animals, peacocks. Due to the dark background of the night sky the figures gain a greater sense of volume. The image was a part of the commission from Philip IV of Spain to decorate Torre de la Parada.

The IPF standard is currently used by some organisations to process payments between the United States and Europe. IPF creates rules, processes, and inter-member agreements that allow IPF's members to minimize the cost of cross-border payments. Its members include the United States Federal Reserve and other central banks, as well as other payments industry entities such as financial institutions and ACH operators. The IPF ensures that all members are using the same standards and processing payments in a similar way, to mitigate issues and to assure a quick and smooth process, even if it is cross-border payment. IPF is similar to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in that both initiatives aim to facilitate international payments, base their standards on ISO 20022, and involve mostly banks as their main participants. IPF differs from SEPA because IPF is global rather than limited to Europe; IPF is market-based rather than a political initiative; IPF involves more public entities, smaller banks, and clearing houses, rather than larger banks; and IPF superimposes a standard that allows existing national standards to communicate with each other rather than replacing them with a new standard. Unlike SEPA documentation, which is available on the European Payments Council's website, IPF documentation is not available to the public.

Following the Childers Reforms, the 47th and 81st Regiments amalgamated as the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment with its depot at the barracks in 1881. The barracks also served as the depot of the East Lancashire Regiment from 1898, when the regiment re-located from Burnley Barracks, until 1939. The Loyal North Lancashire Regiment and the East Lancashire Regiment both returned to the barracks shortly after the Second World War. The barracks, which went on to become the regional centre for infantry training as the Lancastrian Brigade Depot in 1960, became the depot of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment in 1970 as well as Headquarters North West District in 1977 and then the headquarters of 42 (North West) Brigade in 1991. The keep, and 15 other buildings and structures in the barracks, are Grade II listed buildings. In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the site would close in 2022; however in February 2019 it was announced that the closure date had been put back to 2027.

She served primarily in the waters around the United Kingdom as a convoy support escort. She was named for New Waterford, Nova Scotia. New Waterford was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 17 February 1943 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt and launched 3 July 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 21 January 1944 at Victoria, British Columbia. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog (weapon)Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After commissioning, New Waterford transited to Halifax, arriving on 9 March 1944. She then proceeded to work up in Bermuda. Upon her return, New Waterford was assigned to escort group EG 6 to replace the severely damaged . Arriving towards the end of June 1944, she remained with this group until the end of the war, assigned for short periods to Plymouth and Portsmouth. From 14 March to 20 April 1945, New Waterford, as Senior Officer's Ship, deployed with Escort Group 6 into the English Channel.Rohwer, p. 400 In April 1945 she returned to Canada to commence a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. The work, done in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, was completed in November and she departed for the west coast in January 1946. Soon after arrival, she was paid off at Esquimalt on 7 March 1946. =Postwar service= New Waterford remained out of service until 1953, when she was briefly recommissioned. She was then sent for conversion to a Prestonian-class frigate. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti-submarine mortars. She was recommissioned with pennant number 304 on 31 January 1958. She served with the Seventh Canadian Escort Squadron In March 1961, New Waterford was among the ships that took part in a combined naval exercise with the United States Navy off Nova Scotia. She waspaid off for the final time on 22 December 1966. She was sold in 1967 and broken up at Savona, Italy. References =Notes= =Sources=  Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

Its budget was about $12 million and it brought an estimated 300,000 refugees, making it the \\"largest airborne refugee operation in American history.\\" The Freedom Flights were an important and unusual chapter of cooperation in the history of Cuban-American foreign relations, which is otherwise characterized by mutual distrust. The program changed the racial makeup of Miami and fueled the growth of the Cuban-American enclave there.  Background  Many Cubans traversed the Florida Straits to immigrate to the United States when the waiting list for the Freedom Flights grew. =Previous emigration= Political discontent led to the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which caused the beginning of massive Cuban- American immigration. Those factors combined to create in Cuba an atmosphere that was, according to scholar Aviva Chomsky, \\"ripe for revolution,\\" which Castro exploited to gain power. In the immediate wake of the revolution, emigration started with the most affluent classes. Although many pro-Batista corrupted government officials were among those first exiles, it was soon followed by thousands of disenchanted middle-class Cubans of all ethnicities. =Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965= In the United States the Immigration Act of 1924 put in immigration quotas that favored immigrants from Northern and Western Europe, and completely banned Arabs, Indians, and other Asians. As the civil rights movement gained moment in the United States laws that discriminated based on an individuals ethnicity or race began to be repealed. With the gaining traction of the civil rights movement the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was passed which ended the previous national quotas and bans on immigration. After the passing of the bill President Lyndon B. Johnson declared in a speech in front of the Statue of Liberty that Cubans and all others who want asylum should be given a chance to get it. He would state, \\"I declare this afternoon to the people of Cuba that those who seek refuge here in America will find it.... Our tradition as an asylum for the oppressed is going to be upheld.\\" =Camarioca boatlift= When Castro's policies began to take shape, a large wave of disillusioned immigrants crashed on South Florida's beaches. A chaotic episode of this wave of immigration, the Camarioca boatlift in 1965, led to unusual cooperation between the Cuban and American governments, the enactment of the Freedom Flights program. On September 28, Castro announced that dissidents could leave through the port of Camarioca, in the province of Matanzas. The chaotic scene of thousands of boats dangerously attempting to traverse the Florida Straits and enter the safety of American soil illegally prompted action by the United States, whose Coast Guard found itself overwhelmed. = Cuban Adjustment Act = The Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 revised Cubans' immigrant status as \\"parolees\\" and offered a unique route to permanent residency. Cuban immigrants were initially assigned the temporary status of \\"parolees\\" because it was assumed that they would return to the island shortly. It soon became clear, however, that return would not be forthcoming, causing the United States to offer Cubans a path to permanent residency. The law granted Cubans preferential treatment, \\"a clerical loophole co-sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy to expedite entry to the United States for Freedom Flight Cubans.\\" It effectively gave Cubans an \\"open-ended entitlement [to permanent residence]\\" in the United States. Cubans were given preferential treatment in the United States for four main reasons: Cold War politics, reduction of administrative burdens for immigrants, humanitarian concerns, and Cuban professionals' potential impact on the United States economy. The United States government was concerned that Cuba would serve as a model for leftist revolution. It was also concerned that the Soviet Union would exploit Cuba's strategic location. By facilitating a mass exodus from Cuba, the Cuban Adjustment Act effectively created a \\"brain drain\\" of human capital that destabilized the Castro regime, undermined the legitimacy of an oppressive government, and fostered anticommunist public sentiment that would garner support for massive Cold War spending programs. The act also reduced administrative burdens for immigrants. Under prior law, the Cuban refugee needed to leave the country, obtain a visa from a US consular office abroad, and re-enter the country. The act created an easier avenue for Cuban-American immigrants to secure their residency. Humanitarian concerns further motivated the legislation, as the United States committed itself to facilitate dissidents' exodus from political persecution in Castro's post-revolutionary state. There were more practical concerns, as well. Many of the early refugees were highly skilled professionals in Cuba's economic elite and so could contribute to American production. The Senate Report in the Act's legislative history notes, \\"the talents and skills of many of the refugees, particularly in the professional field... will be put to use in the national interest\\". =Establishment of emigration program= For its part, the Cuban government was receptive to establishing a safe and orderly program, as the sight of thousands of citizens risking their lives to leave the country reflected poorly on the Castro administration. The two countries engaged in unusually mutual negotiations despite Cuba's anti-American sentiment and the US ideological opposition to communism. The negotiations resulted in the creation of the Freedom Flights program. The first Freedom Flight took place on December 1, 1965.Anonymous \\"The History of Operation Pedro Pan,\\" pedropan.org, undated.  Exodus  = Emigrants' motivations = Many Cubans were eager to leave the country in pursuit of freedom. Critics saw Castro as a classical Latin American caudillo, a ruler who treated the country like his personal property. The government suppressed religion and confiscated private property. A climate of fear prevailed over all aspects of life. Silvio, a Cuban, remarks, \\"Everyone lives in fear all the time.\\" A Cuban- American, Octavio, observes, \\"Cuba itself was a prison\\". The US promised a different climate. Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez recounts the emotional story of first seeing the country: \\"I cried quietly while kissing the [American] flag and said a prayer.... For the first time in my life, I felt free.\\" During the nationalization of small businesses in the Revolutionary Offensive some small merchants would decide to leave Cuba in the airlift. = Persecution in Cuba = Although the Castro government initially allowed citizens to leave, it would eventually discourage emigration by harassing and humiliating Cubans who signed up for the program. The program quickly gained popularity; by March 1968, over one million people were on the waiting list. Those on the waitlist were fired from their jobs, deemed \\"enemies of the state,\\" and hassled by members of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs). Some were interned in camps far from their homes and families, and their property was confiscated upon their departure. Castro also referred to those who left as gusanos (worms) and insisted to the Cuban people that Cuba was better off without them because the gusanos were the bourgeoisie, who had capitalized on them in the earlier system. The actions worked only minimally. Although one million people were on the waitlist in March 1968, a Chicago Tribune poll in April 1966 found that almost two million Cubans wanted to leave. = Popularity of emigration = Despite the intense hardship that the Castro government threatened and delivered, the Freedom Flights program remained popular, and long waiting lists forced Cuban citizens to seek other methods of emigration. Freedom Flight immigrant Orlando Torres signed up in 1965, at the beginning of the program, but needed to wait two years to leave. The popularity of the program resulted in a long waiting list that often made Cubans wait and suffer in humiliation and harassment for years before they finally left. By September 1970, Cubans grew desperate as wait times grew longer, and some tried to emigrate through the \\"corridor of death,\\" the Florida Straits. = End of exodus = This emigration effectively became a \\"brain drain\\" of Cuba's human capital, as the professionals needed to sustain Cuba's economy relocated to the United States. The effects were so severe that Castro repeatedly complained about them, and in May 1969, as the economic effects intensified, Castro stopped accepting applications for exit visas. The effects also caused Castro to suspend the program from May to December 1972, and on April 6, 1973, the last Freedom Flight touched down at Miami International Airport.  Aftermath  = Processing= When the Cuban- Americans arrived in Miami, they were processed at the Freedom Tower (la Torre de la Libertad), which came to be known as the \\"Ellis Island of the South.\\" Today, it is a National Historic Landmark and a cultural education center, a testament to the important role it once served. =American backlash= As the community settled in, it faced intense discrimination and a difficult language barrier. Unlike the immigrants of today, Cubans then did not have any government help, such as food stamps and other benefits immigrants enjoy today. Immigrant Luis Botifoll notes, \\"Some resented us because we spoke Spanish, we would talk too loud, and took jobs away from them.\\" He recalls signs that read, \\"No Pets, No Children, and No Cubans.\\" Letters to the editor of Miami newspapers complained that Cubans \\"were sacrificing our welfare and security.\\" A popular bumper sticker lamented, \\"Will the Last American Leaving Miami Please Bring the Flag.\\" The Freedom Flight Cubans also faced a language barrier. Dade County's official language was English until 1973/so all official documents were produced only in English. Without an established Cuban-American base, the early immigrants were thrust into a discriminatory culture with a foreign language, impeding their development. The immigrants, however, found Cuban-American sanctuaries from the challenges of their new lives and associated them with the freedom and liberty they desired. They affectionately called the Freedom Tower \\"el refugio\\" (\\"the refuge\\") and temporarily lived in \\"Casas de la libertad\\" (\\"Houses of Liberty\\") set up at Miami International Airport. The Freedom Flights program itself also explicitly references freedom. The important early landmarks and the program itself thus served as sanctuary and represented explicit connections to freedom and liberty. = Possibility of return to Cuba = Initially, the Cuban-American immigrants and the United States government saw the immigration as temporary, that the immigrants would promptly return to Cuba after Castro lost power. Luis Botifoll recalls, \\"All we had in mind was to return to Cuba.... Nobody wanted to commit themselves to a job. We all lived day-to- day.\\" President Johnson was confident the Cubans could eventually return: \\"the tides of history run strong, and in another day, the Cubans can return to their homeland to find it cleansed of terror and free from fear.\\" To that end, both the Cuban-American community and the United States government worked to undermine Castro's rule. The head of the Bacardi empire in the mid-1960s, Pep√≠n Bosch, helped organize anti-Castro propaganda and paramilitary operations. A famous anti-Castro group, Alpha 66, still exists today. By the middle of the Freedom Flights, in the late 1960s, small armed parties sparked guerilla warfare in Cuba. The United States government also organized the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion using Cuban exiles as soldiers, which resulted in the capture and imprisonment of 1100 Cuban-Americans. = Cuban- American culture = Cuban men playing dominoes in Little Havana, circa 1975 Freedom Flight Cubans resisted but still experienced an \\"Americanization\\" of their culture. Immigrant Angel Perdomo notes, \\"I try to stay a Cuban, but the Americanization is in me.\\" The Cuban-American thus drew a distinction between \\"Cuban\\" and \\"American;\\" connecting the two with a hyphen did not imply they became the same. Many Cuban-Americans resisted the second part of their label, trying to preserve the culture of their homeland in its most pristine form. Even while Cubans resisted \\"Americanization\\" and preserved their traditional culture, they \\"Cubanized\\" American culture. In 1973, Miami's Dade County officially became bilingual. Classic Cuban musician Benny Mor√© blasted from radio sets, Cuban bodegas replaced American supermarkets, and men donned guayaberas for any occasion. Additionally, private schools focused on Cuba's history and culture, ensuring that younger generations would appreciate their heritage. = Formation of Little Havana = Mom and Pop stores in Little Havana, circa 1978 The Freedom Flights solidified the formation of Little Havana, an area of 4 square miles densely populated by Cuban immigrants that preserves an authentic Cuban culture. A distinct subculture, Little Havana provides space for Cuban immigrants to congregate and reproduce life as it used to be. Contemporary newspaper articles attribute Little Havana with a distinct Cuban feel. Freedom Flight Cubans congregated in Little Havana, seeking to celebrate their culture, solidifying its formation. Little Havana was a concentrated microcosm of the greater South Florida Cuban-American community, an \\"enclave\\" secured by the Freedom Flights that facilitated Cuban- American growth. The enclave, a self-contained economic sphere of self- promoting Cuban influence (Cubans employed and bought from other Cubans, stimulating economic growth), was begun by the first wave of post-Castro Cuban refugees in the early 1960s but solidified by the Freedom Flight Cubans of the late 1960s. The enclave accelerated the growth of Cuban-American economic and political clout. Elaine Condon remarks, \\"Their overwhelming success, in the span of one generation, has been virtually unprecedented in American history.\\" By securing the enclave, the Freedom Flight Cubans provided a community that would facilitate the early lives of most exiles. Cuban-American immigration expert and sociology professor Juan Clark observes that \\"the [Freedom Flight Cubans] turned Miami into the epicenter for all Cuban exiles.\\"  See also  *Cuba‚ÄìUnited States relations  References  Category:1965 in Cuba Category:1966 in Cuba Category:1967 in Cuba Category:1968 in Cuba Category:1969 in Cuba Category:1970 in Cuba Category:1971 in Cuba Category:1972 in Cuba Category:1973 in Cuba Category:Cuban refugees Category:Government agencies established in 1965 Category:1973 disestablishments Category:Refugee aid organizations Category:Airlifts Category:Immigration to the United States ","title":"Freedom Flights"},{"id":"42420142","text":"High Rocks is a mountain in Warren County, New Jersey.

He had previously recorded the song in 1966 with his band the Flying Machine, but that recording was not released until 1971 on James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine. It was also released by Apple as a single in France (APF 506), backed with \\"Something's Wrong.\\" \\"Knocking 'Round the Zoo\\" and \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" were included on the demo tape that Taylor sent producer Peter Asher that convinced him to sign Taylor to Apple. Allmusic critic Lindsay Planer describes \\"Knocking 'Round the Zoo\\" as a \\"pseudo-blues.\\" The lyrics were inspired by Taylor's stay at the psychiatric facility McLean Hospital. In the first verse of the song, Taylor sings that \\"There's bars on all the windows and they're countin' up the spoons.\\" In actuality, McLean had 2000 pound security screens on the windows rather than bars, but they did use special utensils and count all the metal after each meal. The verse goes on to state that \\"if I'm feeling edgy there's a chick who's paid to be my slave/And she'll hit me with a needle if she thinks I'm trying to misbehave.\\" In the second verse, Taylor further sings of his anger towards the workers at McLean. In the third verse, Taylor sings of how he felt ostracized at McLean with lines such as \\"Now my friends all come to see me/They point at me and stare.\\" According to the editors of Time, \\"Taylor adds a chilling descant of bedlamite sounds\\" to this verse. Rolling Stone critic Timothy Crouse describes the song's drum beat as \\"sinister\\" and its guitar playing as \\"nervous,\\" stating that this reflects the \\"anger and impatience\\" Taylor felt at McLean. Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Mark Coleman considers \\"Knocking 'Round the Zoo\\" a \\"highlight\\" of James Taylor, describing it as \\"kicky\\" and saying that it predicted the path Taylor would take in future recordings. Time praises its \\"witty, riffy musical irony.\\" Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau says that it \\"combines a subdued sense of humor with more naturalism.\\" Taylor biographer Timothy White criticizes the \\"ponderous\\" prelude on string instruments that arranger Richard Hewson prepended to the song on the James Taylor album. Rolling Stone writer Jules Siegel criticized the song for sounding like \\"a sado-masochistic fantasy.\\" Siegel suggested that Taylor was making himself out to be an aristocrat and still in control despite being in a mental hospital, with \\"a female attendant paid to be his slave.\\" Siegel also criticizes the line about the attendant hitting him with a needle.

She married entrepreneur John Edwin Lutz (1854-1920) in a large ceremony at Knoxville's Second Presbyterian Church on February 10, 1886. Their home, Westwood, which stands on land given to Lutz by her father, was completed in 1890. The house's design incorporated a studio and gallery for Lutz, which she would often open to visitors in subsequent years. The Lutzes had two children, Louise Lutz Holloway and Edwin Rowland Lutz.

History By the very late 1930s, Harland Sanders' Corbin, Kentucky, gas station was so well known for its fried chicken, that Sanders decided to remove the gas pumps and build a restaurant and motel in its place. While perfecting his secret recipe with 11 herbs and spices, Sanders found that pan frying chicken was too slow, requiring 30 minutes per order. Deep frying the chicken required half the time, but produced dry, unevenly done chicken. In 1939 he found that using a pressure fryer produced tasty, moist chicken in eight or nine minutes. By July 1940 Sanders finalized what came to be known as his Original Recipe. After Sanders formed a partnership with Pete Harmon, they began marketing the chicken in the 1950s as Kentucky Fried Chicken, the company shipped the spices already mixed to restaurants to preserve the recipe's secrecy. He claimed that the ingredients \\"stand on everybody's shelf\\". Sanders used vegetable oil for frying chicken. By 1993, for reasons of economy, many KFC outlets had chosen to use a blend of palm and soybean oil. In Japan, the oil used is mainly the more expensive cottonseed and corn oil, as KFC Japan believes that this offers superior taste quality. Reception Sanders' Original Recipe of \\"11 herbs and spices\\" is one of the most famous trade secrets in the catering industry. Franchisee Dave Thomas, better known as the founder of Wendy's, argued that the secret recipe concept was successful because \\"everybody wants in on a secret\\" and former KFC owner John Y. Brown, Jr. called it \\"a brilliant marketing ploy.\\" The New York Times described the recipe as one of the company's most valuable assets. The recipe is not patented, because patents are published in detail and come with an expiration date, whereas trade secrets can remain the intellectual property of their holders in perpetuity. KFC uses its Original Recipe as a means to differentiate its product from its competitors. Early franchisee Pete Harman credited the chain's popularity to the recipe and the product, and John Y. Brown cites the \\"incredibly tasty, almost addictive\\" product as the basis of KFC's staying power. On the other hand, Allen Adamson, managing director of brand consultancy Landor, remains unconvinced about the contribution of the secret formula aspect. He argues: \\"The story may still be part of these companies' folklore, but I'd be surprised if more than 2 percent buy the brand because of it.\\" In reference to the original recipe, the official Twitter account of KFC follows only eleven other accounts: Six public figures (ranging from politics to sport) named Herb as well as the five members of the Spice Girls. Recipe A copy of the recipe, signed by Sanders, is held safe inside a vault in KFC's Louisville headquarters, along with eleven vials containing the herbs and spices. To maintain the secrecy of the recipe, half of it is produced by Griffith Laboratories before it is given to McCormick, who add the second half. In 1983, William Poundstone conducted laboratory research into the coating mix, as described in his book Big Secrets, and claimed that a sample he examined contained only flour, salt, monosodium glutamate and black pepper. KFC maintains that it still adheres to Sanders' original 1940 recipe. In Todd Wilbur's television program Top Secret Recipe, the Colonel's former secretary, Shirley Topmiller, revealed that Sanders learned from his mother that sage and savory are good seasonings for chicken. Also, Winston Shelton, a former friend of the Colonel, said that the secret recipe contains Thalassery black pepper. It is well attested that Harland Sanders asked Bill Summers of Marion-Kay Spices in Brownstown, Indiana, US to recreate his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices. While alive, Sanders recommended the Marion-Kay seasoning to franchisees over the corporate version, as he believed the latter had been made inferior by its owners. In 1982, after Sanders' death, KFC brought a lawsuit against Marion-Kay and the latter was barred from selling its mixture to KFC franchises. The Marion-Kay seasoning is still sold under the name \\"99-X,\\" and according to Sanders biographer Josh Ozersky, it is indistinguishable from the original KFC recipe. In August 2016, the Chicago Tribune reported that Joe Ledington of Kentucky, a nephew by marriage of Colonel Sanders, had claimed to have found a copy of the original KFC fried chicken recipe on a handwritten piece of paper in an envelope in a scrapbook. Tribune staffers conducted a cooking test of this recipe, which took several attempts to get right. They had to determine whether the \\"Ts\\" meant tablespoons or teaspoons, and soon concluded the correct interpretation was tablespoons. After some trial and error, they decided the chicken should be soaked in buttermilk and coated once in the breading mixture, then fried in oil at in a pressure fryer until golden brown. As a pressure fryer was too big, a deep fryer was used alternatively to substitute the pressure fryer. They also claimed that with the addition of MSG as a flavor enhancer, they could produce fried chicken which tasted \\"indistinguishable\\" from fried chicken they had purchased at KFC. The recipe found by Joe Ledington reads as follows: 11 Spices ‚Äì Mix with 2 cups white flour # tablespoon salt # tablespoon thyme # tablespoon basil # tablespoon oregano #1 tablespoon celery salt #1 tablespoon black pepper #1 tablespoon dry mustard #4 tablespoon paprika #2 tablespoon garlic salt #1 tablespoon ground ginger #3 tablespoon white pepper While Ledington expressed uncertainty that the recipe was the Original Recipe, he had a hand in mixing the Original Recipe for Colonel Sanders when he was a young boy, and recalled that white pepper was a principal ingredient. KFC has admitted that they include MSG to the recipe, but don't include it as one of the ingredients of the 11 herb and spices recipe.

Through their music, they sing to \\"celebrate the black experience in Egypt.\\" According to Amir Salah, the band strives to maintain a sound true to the name they carry, which is unique, natural, and independent. Black Theama tries to create music that does not fall in line with the \\"standard pop-music cliches.\\" \\"Our project is not to croon about starry-eyed love and teenage heartbreak. We assumed that there was a wide array of emotions and issues not yet tackled in contemporary singing, and we think that there is an insistent demand for that genre\\" - Ahmed Bahr, singer and co-founder of Black Theama. Background The group was founded by Amir Salah El Deen, who was originally in a theater group called \\"Karisma.\\" Together with his friend Mohamed Abdo, they met the third member of their future group, Ahmed Bahr, at one of their early shows. They worked well together and decided to form a new group which became Black Theama. Black Theama has collaborated with many other musicians over the years. Massar Egbari and Cairokee are just two of the Egyptian bands that Black Theama has performed with. Aside from the three core singers of Black Theama, many other musicians are also part of the collaboration. Among them was Weka Soliman current guitarist of Canadian rock band Special Ops. =Underground Following= The musical group is unique for its decision to remain an independent band. Black Theama is not affiliated with any large commercial company within the music industry. The group prefers to utilize their own resources to produce their music, recordings, and promotions. Black Theama's fan base and underground following fund the band. Their fan base is totally responsible for the band's success and ability to finance further music production. The cost of music production as an independent group can be expensive; the average cost of producing a record is between LE 100,000 and LE 600,000 Egyptian pounds. Black Theama has produced over 50 songs and a collection of music videos since its beginning. The band strives to create music that reflects and captures the feel of daily life in Egypt, as well as their experiences as Egyptians from the South. \\"It means being special, and being dark-skinned in Egypt... And people from the South have their own character, their own culture - even their tone of voice is different\\" ‚Äî singer Mohammed Abdo. Poets Ramy Yehia, Mido Zoheir, and Diaa el-Rahman have worked with Black Theama to create its unique sound and voice. The band's lyrics reflect the life, issues, and politics of Egyptian society, including lyrics that the \\"marginalized and underrepresented youth\\" can relate to. Black Theama often performs at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (Library of Alexandria) and at the El Sawy Culture wheel. Nubian Influence The Nubian region of Egypt is located in the south of Upper Egypt. Black Theama infuses traditional Nubian folksongs into an alternative modern musical style that is growing in popularity. The musical group has an authentic feel while presenting new sounds and lyrics.[ According to co-founder and singer Mohammad Abdo, \\"Southern music is one of the main tributaries of Egyptian music, and is a real part of our identity, not only because we originate from Nubia and are dark-skinned. We subconsciously came to recognize how much we‚Äôre affected by this unique character and culture, and moved by the music. We are always trying to work with the density of black music, including Nubian, and this provides our music with a distinct flavor.\\" =Awards= Black Theama was nominated at the 2013 World Music Awards for Best Group, Best Live Act, Best Song, and Best Video Clip for the song Fi Belad Al-ayy Haga (released June 2013). Black Theama was the first musical group to represent Egypt, as well as the region, at the international competition. Music Black Theama has performed throughout Egypt, as well as in TV commercials and movie soundtracks. During the 2013 Ramadan holiday season, Black Theama appeared in a Vodafone commercial. The band also sang the song used for the opening credits of the movie 1000 Mabrouk. =Discography= Ghawy Bany Adameen, ÿ∫ÿßŸàŸä ÿ®ŸÜŸä ÿ¢ÿØŸÖŸäŸÜ , released in April 2015, produced by Black Theama Productions, contains 14 songs : Enta Fakerny Hendy ÿ•ŸÜÿ™ ŸÅÿßŸÉÿ±ŸÜŸä ŸáŸÜÿØŸä Kebert ŸÉÿ®ÿ±ÿ™ Weenik ŸàŸäŸÜŸÉ Kol Mara ŸÉŸÑ ŸÖÿ±ÿ© Ousso Ousso ÿ£Ÿàÿ≥Ÿà ÿ£Ÿàÿ≥Ÿà Set El Hosn ÿ≥ÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ Lays Laha Mady ŸÑŸäÿ≥ ŸÑŸáÿß ŸÖÿßÿ∂Ÿä Akhbar Ahram Gomhoreya ÿ£ÿÆÿ®ÿßÿ± ÿ£Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÖ ÿ¨ŸÖŸáŸàÿ±Ÿäÿ© Omaret El Nas ÿπŸÖÿßÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ≥ Ya Beban Ya Aliah Ÿäÿß ÿ®Ÿäÿ®ÿßŸÜ Ÿäÿß ÿπÿßŸÑŸäÿ© Ala Shut El Neel ÿπŸÑŸä ÿ¥ÿ∑ ÿßŸÑŸÜŸäŸÑ Ya Prince El Layaly Ÿäÿß ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿ≥ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸäÿßŸÑŸä Koun Saied ŸÉŸÜ ÿ≥ÿπŸäÿØ Ghawy Bany Adameen ÿ∫ÿßŸàŸä ÿ®ŸÜŸä ÿ¢ÿØŸÖŸäŸÜ *Bahar ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßÿ±, released in 2010 *:Kona Soghar ŸÉŸÜÿß ÿµÿ∫ÿßÿ± *: Ouh Ah ŸÇÿ±ŸÑ ÿßŸá *: Bahar ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßÿ± *: Ensan ÿ•ŸÜÿ≥ÿßŸÜ *: Eh Yaani ÿßŸäŸá ŸäÿπŸÜŸä (This song, which means \\"What If,\\" received wide popularity breaking into the mainstream.

Critical response Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"low-key kind of dramedy\\" and a \\"quirky French indie that gets by more on style and sass than on its storytelling skills, [...] With endearing performances and crafty 16mm imagery, but also a tad too many winks to the camera, this Cannes ACID sidebar selection should see additional fest and niche art-house play\\". Ronnie Scheib of Variety commented that \\"[i]n Sebastien Betbeder's playfully arty 2 Autumns, 3 Winters, three protagonists offer self-conscious riffs on their every thought and action, directly addressing the camera to describe past happenings, present happenings or what's about to occur momentarily. Mundane actions, trite exchanges and life-altering events all undergo the same literary alchemy, creating a matter-of-fact, Woody Allen-ish sense of complicity with the viewer. Maintaining a bemused, sometimes comic distance, Betbeder traces how happenstance crystallizes into biography as his characters traverse the titular seasons, with results that will delight some and alienate others.\\" Mike Russell of The Oregonian gave it a 'B' grade saying \\"[a] fair amount of traumatic stuff happens in 2 Autumns, 3 Winters [... b]ut writer/director S√©bastien Betbeder's French seriocomic romance still feels light (or emotionally distant, depending), thanks to the film's fusillade of stylistic tics.\\" References External links  2 Autumns, 3 Winters at Allocine * (with English subtitles) Category:2013 films Category:2013 romantic comedy films Category:French films Category:French romantic comedy films Category:French-language films Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in the 2010s Category:Films shot in France Category:2013 comedy films ","title":"2 Autumns, 3 Winters"},{"id":"42420392","title":"E.

They are usually small constructions. The floor areas range from 3.5 m2 to 35 m2. Catxirulos are built of stone without mortar or cement, although some are reinforced with these materials. Most were built by the owners, using local materials. thumbright360pxArru√©'s Catxirulo, 1910 [http://www.benaguasil.com/ Source:Town hall of Benaguasil] thumbTypical Benaguasil's catxirulo [http://www.benaguasil.com/ Source:Town hall of Benaguasil]  Etymology  The word ‚Äúcachirulo‚Äù or ‚Äúcatxirulo‚Äù, in Benaguasil, only has the meaning of dry stone rustic retreat, usually covered with a false vault; this meaning is shared with other localities. However, in Valencian, the general meaning of the word is comet or star. In Spanish, it also means: a container for liquor; a small boat with three masts; or ornaments with feathers and ribbons that women wore on their heads at the end of 18th century. In Aragonese it means a head scarf. The first documentation in Valencian is by Jos√© Escrig y Mart√≠nez, contained in the dictionary ‚ÄúValenciano-Castellano‚Äù of 1851, where it says ‚ÄúCagerul, Cagerulo, Cachirulo‚Äù: small boat with three sails. In Valencian it is also often applied to the ‚ÄúBarracas‚Äù or rustic rooms topped with a cone, and similar objects.  Geographical extension  The term is only used in areas that were formerly used for rain-fed crops such as carob, olive or vines. It is not used in any areas of irrigated orchards. It is found in the ‚Äúpartidas‚Äù of ‚ÄúLes Travesses, Els Cremats, Els Cabe√ßos, La Ca√±ada de Amor√≥s, La Ca√±ada de Mareta, El Pla de Lucas and El Pla de Paterna‚Äù.  Construction technique  The catxirulo is made completely with dry stone, without ornaments. It is built in round, square and rectangular plans, not exceeding 1.5 meters in height and finished with a conical dome. The round form is the oldest; it facilitates the starting point of the dome. With square or rectangular plans, the internal shape matches up with the external. The door was always away from the north and west. It is usually a simple lintel, a flat stone resting on pillars. Others have a two-segment arch, two inclined lintels at an angle on the side pillar, ‚Äúin the barraca‚Äù as they say in Benaguasil. Also found are arches with elongated stones positioned radially. = Interior works = Inside of the catxirulo we can find constructed several elements. * Niches: empty space between four flat stones, like small cabinets set into the wall. * Viewpoints: openings through the walls to look out. * Vents: holes through the wall, which may be made with the same technique as the niche, or by placing a trunk perpendicularly to the wall; after building the wall, the trunk is removed, leaving a round hole. * Mangers: for feeding large animals. * Stone benches. * Grippers: Niches that are crossed with a stick or a simple stake with an elbow. These served to tie the animals. = The roof = A false dome was built using circular rows of successively smaller diameter.  Former cachirulos  According to plans dated 1928: * Catxirulo I.

The BBC reported that Colin Kerr, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission publicity director, said that a total of 30,000 Indian soldiers are not named on the Basra memorial, despite fallen British soldiers being named, only Indian officers are accorded with the honor.

The Winston-Salem chapter was the first Black Panther Party chapter to be formed in the South. Along with the New Orleans chapter, it was one of the two most significant BPP chapters to operate in this region. It is primarily remembered for its successful implementation of community service programs, which the national BPP called \\"survival programs.\\" Focused on improving the lives of the African-American community in Winston- Salem, these programs included free breakfast program for local children, and the Joseph Waddell People's Free Ambulance Service. Similar to most other Black Panther Party chapters around the country, members of the Winston-Salem chapter faced a great deal of harassment and criticism from the FBI, as well as from other law enforcement agencies, the K.K.K., and members of the Winston-Salem community.Black Panther Party, ‚ÄúLarry Little on ‚ÄòSqueaky‚Äôs‚Äô Death List: No. Carolina B.P.P. Head Threatened by K.K.K.,‚Äù The Black Panther, October 17, 1975. All members of the Winston-Salem BPP chapter were African American. The predominantly white staff of the North Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union staunchly defended the Winston BPP in court and in the media. Co-founders and party members Larry Little and Nelson Malloy gained important leadership experience with the Panthers and continued to be politically active in the city. Both were elected to the Board of Aldermen in Winston-Salem in later years. In 2012, the city of Winston-Salem erected a historical marker in honor of the local BPP chapter, recognizing the group for its positive effects on the community during a time of social and political turmoil.  National Black Panther Party  = Background = The Black Panther Party (or BPP) was an African- American revolutionary organization active in the United States from 1966-1982. Founded in Oakland, California on October 15, 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, the party originally identified as the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, and called for the protection of Black neighborhoods from police brutality. Over time, the Party's beliefs and objectives evolved, and the Party developed as a Marxist group. It advocated arming all African Americans for self-defense, exempting African Americans from the draft and from all other sanctions of so-called white America, releasing all African Americans from jail because of bias in the system, and paying compensation to African Americans for the centuries of exploitation by White Americans during and after slavery. At its peak in the late 1960s, the Black Panther Party had more than two thousand members nationwide, and chapters located in several major American cities, including New York City, Chicago, New Orleans, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. = Platform = The founders of the Black Panther Party, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, created the Party's platform, called the Ten-Point Program. The Ten- Point Program consisted of ten statements advocating changes that would improve the lives of Blacks in the United States.  Origins in North Carolina  = Greensboro, North Carolina = Eric Brown and Harold Avent, two students at North Carolina Agriculture and Technical University, began to organize a Black Panther Party (BPP) in Greensboro in early 1969. Protests, altercations, and arrests motivated by the unofficial BPP in Greensboro caught the attention of Blacks all over North Carolina, with ideals spreading predominantly to Charlotte and Winston-Salem. = Charlotte, North Carolina = Jerome Johnson, a student at Johnson C. Smith University spent the summer of 1968 in Oakland and joined the Black Panther Party there. When Jerome returned to JCSU for the 1968 fall semester he called a group of local activists together and along with Benjamin Chavis, Jr., a student at UNC Charlotte, a chapter of the Black Panther Party was organized in Charlotte. Some of the early members were Michael Laney, Stoney Nash, Rudolph Nash, Benjamin Harrison, Cheryl Davis, Fess Bradley, and several other high school and college students The group met at JCSU until an office was opened on South Turner Street, in the Smallwood section of Charlotte. Party members went on community patrols, sold the Black Panther newspaper, and briefly started a Free Breakfast for Children Program. Unfortunately, the criminal conduct of a few undisciplined members of the party prompted David Hilliard, the Chief of Staff for the Party to order the Charlotte Chapter to cease and desist with operations in 1969. = Winston-Salem, North Carolina = Layoffs, walkouts, and pickets of the tobacco companies by their predominantly black labor force signaled Civil Rights activism in Winston-Salem as early as the 1940s. With rising activism in the 1960s and gains in federal legislation, in 1968 a group of Black youths, inspired by the North Carolina A & T students, gathered to discuss working on local racial issues and to meet welfare needs of the Black community. This group was led by Nelson Malloy and Robert Greer, and the members chose the name of Organization of Black Liberation. They hoped to affiliate one day with the Black Panther Party. Intending to solve problems not addressed by the Civil Rights Movement, the group sought a ‚Äúradical reconstructuring of the system.‚Äù They were committed to change. The group worked for over a year in order to obtain a National Committee to Combat Fascism (NCCF) charter, distinguishing itself from their counterparts in Greensboro and Charlotte through their use of deliberate and meticulous political organizing. As the group awaited their NCCF charter, it encountered a period of relative inactivity due to its unofficial affiliation with the National Black Panther Party. During that period, the unofficial Panthers worked to set up a free breakfast program, win order to provide breakfast to underprivileged school children, and promoted the sale of the Black Panther newspaper, which funded the group's official indoctrination. The group's official affiliation with the National Black Panther Party member cost three hundred dollars. They did not complete the affiliation until April 1971 due to a number of legal problems and harassment by law enforcement agencies. High Point, North Carolina ''' A Black Panther Party Community Information Center opened at 612 Hulda Street in High Point in the Fall of 1971 and closed in 1972 due to constant local Police harassment. A confrontation between 20 heavily armed Police officers and four Black Panther members took place at the 612 Hulda Street Headquarters on February 10, 1971. Police Chief Laurie Pritchett stated about serving an eviction notice, oddly enough at 6AM in the morning, to the Panthers, \\"we went to the house hoping the use of force could be avoided.\\" The 20 heavily armed Officers fired tear gas into the Panthers pad despite his statement and a fire fight ensued. the Black Panther High Point Four; Larry Medley, Randolph Jennings, George DeWitt and Bradford Lily were later convicted. George DeWitt was later acquitted of discharging a weapon during the shootout. It is interesting that Police Chief Laurie Pritchett was also known for suppressing civil right demonstrators in Albany, Georgia in 1962. The late Martin Luther King stated of Pritchett, during a talk at Stanford University on July 12, 1962, \\"I sincerely believe that Chief Pritchett is a nice man, a basically decent man, but he's so caught up in a system that he ends up saying one thing to us behind closed doors and then we open the newspaper and he's said something else to the press.\\" The High Point Black Panther Party Community Information Center was short lived but served Free Breakfast for Children program and Free Clothing giveaway during its short period of operation. Most High Point Panthers who had been trained at the Winston-Salem Chapter returned to that city. The location, 612 Hulda Street was demolished in the 1980s and renamed Taylor Avenue. Fairview Family Resource Center, 401 Taylor Ave, now sits in its place serving the local community and echoing the Panthers efforts and legacy.  Members and Leaders  = Charter Members = After its official sanction in April 1971, the Winston-Salem Chapter of the Black Panther Party had roughly twenty members and fifty regular volunteers, all of whom remained under heavy FBI surveillance. Robert Greer, a credited founder of the original group, eventually assumed the role of organization head. Other early members included co-founder Nelson Malloy, who later became a city councilman, as well as William Rice, Julius Cornell, Thurmond DuBoise, Jessie Stritt, Nathanial Shelf, Harry Tyson, and Larry Little, who eventually replaced Greer as head of the Branch in 1970. Other original members, David Bowman, John Moore, Grady(Papa Doc)Fuller and Jackie Peoples. = Larry Little = A Winston-Salem native and founding member of this chapter, Larry Little assumed the position of organization head at the age of twenty. Little, a high school basketball star with no college education or political background, first became interested in the Black Panther Party as a teen when he listened to self- proclaimed Panthers from A & T speak at a rally. His interest in Black history, and determination to make a change, led to his rise as the leader of the group. (? after Greer's failure to devote himself fully to the work, and success of their chapter.) Little devoted himself fully to the Party and its success, traveling regularly to the Panther's central headquarters in Oakland, and getting the group more involved in local issues. Under Little's leadership, the branch reached the height of its success, due to his determination to make meaningful change in the Black community. Little was arrested on July 20, 1970 for disorderly conduct, and attempting to incite a riot. The arrest occurred following an altercation with several police officers, who ripped down posters, hung by Little, reading, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Black and I‚Äôm Proud.‚Äù According to Little, the judge at his trial gave him the choice between quitting the Black Panther Party or going to jail; Little chose to remain loyal to the Panthers, and served thirty days in jail. In May 1974 Little decided to run for alderman on the city council, in order to make changes in the city. He narrowly lost to his opponent, Richard N. Davis, an African-American incumbent. The election generated considerable controversy; Davis won with 646 to 566. Some observers believe that Little's political defeat in 1974 showed that many people still viewed the Panthers as a threat, not recognizing programs they had established within the system. Little sensed the decline of his BPP chapter and resigned as head of the organization in early 1976. Afterward, Little earned both undergraduate and law degrees, determined to have more tools for fighting injustice. Today, Little teaches as a tenured associate professor of political science at Winston-Salem State University.  Accomplishments  The Winston-Salem chapter of the Black Panther Party improved the lives of blacks in Winston-Salem by providing Blacks with necessary programs, and raising awareness about both local, and national racial issues. = Community work = The North Carolina Black Panthers committed the majority of its time to local public service work. In their earliest years, the Winston-Salem chapter worked to provide breakfast for school children, by distributing food donated by local businesses. The breakfast program was simple but popular, and successful. It excelled at providing children from poor families with an important daily meal, each morning during the school year. Later the chapter adopted several other inexpensive, yet highly effective community programs to help Winston-Salem's poorer residents. These programs included free pest control, a luxury typically beyond the financial means of a large number of Black residents, as well as free transportation to, and from, prison, for those who had incarcerated family members. The chapter's community outreach also included clothes drives, and inexpensive sickle cell anemia testing. They established a free ambulance service, considered to be one of the group's most successful accomplishments because, although healthcare costs posed a problem for low income Blacks everywhere, no other chapter of the Black Panther Party provided its community with a similar program, or solution. The free ambulance program in North Carolina administered Blacks with free transportation, and healthcare. During its final years, one of the Winston-Salem chapter's primary concerns was Black voter registration. According to the FBI, at their most successful registration drive, the chapter registered over five hundred new voters, making it the ‚Äúmost ambitious project undertaken by the NC chapter to date.‚Äù In 1972, the Winston-Salem party, along with the National Black Panther Party began instituting policies to alter the public image of the party. The Winston-Salem branch followed the instructions given by the National Party by joining churches, as well as engaging with traditional Black community leaders, small business owners, and ministers, in an attempt to revolutionize the community, and bring about change by working through traditional legal institutions. This policy shift proved to be a success for the North Carolina branch, as it directly led to the development of several highly influential community programs mentioned earlier, such as the free ambulance program, as well as greater party support within the community. The previous, violent stance frightened more Blacks than it attracted, costing the chapter a large number of supporters in the community. The ideological change, referred to by Little as a shift ‚Äú‚Ä¶from guns to shoes,‚Äù helped the party to gain more support, but still was not enough to allow the Winston-Salem chapter to accomplish all of its goals. = Raising Political Awareness = The Winston- Salem chapter of the Black Panther Party raised awareness about its beliefs through its involvement with the Black Panther newspaper. The newspaper served as the chapter's primary source of income throughout its lifetime. By buying the newspapers from the national headquarters, at a relatively inexpensive price, the chapter could then resell them, in order to raise money for local programs, as well as inform the local Black community about Black Panther Party affairs nationwide. Not only did the Winston-Salem chapter raise awareness by selling the newspapers locally, in an attempt to inform the citizens of North Carolina, but they also wrote and published a large number of articles in the Newspaper about local affairs. The publication of these articles united the Black community by proving that all Blacks, not just Party members, were victims of brutality, and encouraging Blacks everywhere to join in the fight.  Controversy  The Winston-Salem chapter of the Black Panther Party faced a considerable amount of controversy for the following reasons. = Lack of Political Support = During its founding years, the primary problem faced by the Winston-Salem chapter was lack of support. Winston-Salem may have been an ideal city for the birth of a Panther party because of its large Black population, and potential for Black Radicalism; however, the community lacked universal support. At the time, in Winston-Salem, Blacks made up over one-half of the total population; however, fewer than twenty percent of African Americans owned homes.U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, ‚Äú1970 Census of Population and Housing, North Carolina.‚Äù Washington, D.C.,: U.S. Department of Commerce Field Offices, 1971. The majority of support for the Panther party came from the poorer populations, who benefitted from their community service programs. This group was related to what the party was doing, and appreciated their services. The Black middle class was not as open to the radical group, whose rhetoric and style intimidated them and posed, in their opinions, an even greater threat for the Black community as a whole. Radicalism and altercations with police alienated most community members, who feared, and hoped to avoid further conflict with law enforcement. The branch's lack of community support eventually led to its collapse in 1978. = FBI Strife = The Winston-Salem chapter, like most Black Panther Parties all over the country, caught the attention of the FBI. After a community-wide increase in support for the National Coalition to Combat Fascism (NCCF), the FBI drastically increased its monitoring of the group, doing what they believed was necessary, to defame and discredit the Panthers, in the best interest of the public.Federal Bureau of Investigation, ‚ÄúBlack Panther Party, North Carolina,‚Äù BUFILE number: 105-165706, 1968-1976. extracts online In 1971, the FBI developed a smear campaign intended to create problems between the Winston-Salem Panther party, and the national headquarters in Oakland, hoping that such dissonance would lead to the annihilation of the Winston- Salem chapter, although it did not. The FBI scrutiny did, however, lead to other problems for the chapter. Even minor infractions by the Panthers brought unwanted attention from the FBI. This often disrupted the group's daily activities, and occasionally led to the arrests of group leaders. = Financial Problems & Reevaluation = The Winston-Salem Panthers struggled financially due to their constant controversy with law enforcement agencies. Although the branch occasionally had surpluses in income thanks to erratic donations, it rarely ever had extra money, and at one point was even unable to secure telephone service in their headquarters. The legal and financial problems faced by the chapter also prevented the branch from undertaking massive community service programs. The combination of these problems forced the Winston-Salem Panthers to reevaluate their tactics. The group decided to avoid conflict, and to focus primarily on community service programs. This transition led to a relaxation by the FBI, and allowed the party to pursue its endeavors in peace.  Legacy  The Winston-Salem chapter survived until 1978, making it the last-standing official branch of the Black Panther Party on the East coast. = Party = The legacy left behind by the Winston-Salem Panther Party differs greatly from legacies left by other Panther parties around the country because of its successful policy change. Arguably the most effective branch at implementing the community service approach outlined by national headquarters, the Winston-Salem panthers saw their success in service programs, rather than violent revolts and protests, making it a model of what the national organization wanted and envisioned. The branch, primarily remembered for its service programs, such as its free breakfast program and ambulance service, also gave poor Blacks in Winston-Salem a political voice and enhanced their racial pride. Blacks that once lived in fear of Klan members, felt empowered by the Panthers, and encouraged to stand-up, and defend themselves. The chapter, the first to form in the South, created a long-lasting legacy, firmly cemented in Black North Carolina history by the early 1980s, and recognized again in 2012 with the unveiling of a Black Panther Party marker commemorating the positive change made by the group. = Elected Officials = The activity of the Winston-Salem Black Panther's programs ended with the death of the party in 1978; however, the activism of its major leaders continued for many years. Several members of the Winston- Salem branch went on to become leading political figures, or influence public life in some way, such as Larry Little, who was referred to by the Winston- Salem daily newspaper as the area's most influential African American citizen, and Nelson Malloy, who served as North Ward alderman after Little. The success of the Winston-Salem Panthers later in life highlights the party's other major impact: serving as a training ground for Black elected officials.

It is 4.5 miles long, half a mile wide, and up to 104 feet deep. Trout, salmon, and other species of fish have been observed in the lake. Bald eagles and loons also live on the shoreline. Location and description The pond is located near Maine State Route 180. It is also not far from the community of Ellsworth, Maine. Middle Brook and a number of other small brooks feed into it and Beech Hill Stream flows from the lake. The lake is long and around. On average, it is wide. The average elevation is above sea level. Beech Hill Pond has an area of and a maximum depth of . The average depth is . The temperature at the surface is , while at a depth of , the temperature is . In 1912, the volume of Beach Hill Pond was . Beech Hill Pond experiences erosion and also lacks a buffer in some places. The Secchi depth of the lake was approximately in 1999, in 2003, in 2004, and in 2007. Shoreline There is a cave located underground on the western side of Beech Hill Pond. Ice has been found in it as late as July, causing it to be known as the \\"Cold Cellar\\". The terrain at the edges of the Beech Hill Pond is relatively steep. 90 percent of the shoreline of Beech Hill Pond is developed. Development in the area has substantially increased since the early 1950s. Beech Hill Pond can Be divided in to five distinct areas: * Turtle Cove * Schoolhouse Cove * Beech Hill Landing / Boatlanding Beach * Cellarshore / Cellar Cove * Beechwood Bay History A public boat landing was built on Beech Hill Pond in 1983. The Pond was allegedly, according to the Town and BHPA, named for the nearby ‚ÄòBeech Hill‚Äô, which can be seen from the majority of the shoreline. Beech Hill is named for the types of trees found along its rise. In 2012, the ice receded from Beech Hill Pond on March 21, which is the earliest that it has left the lake since at least 1878. Prior to 2012, the earliest the ice had receded was April 2 (in 2006) and the latest it had receded was May 17 (in 1888). Biology and recreation Fish found in Beech Hill Pond include salmon, rainbow trout, lake trout, brook trout, smallmouth bass, and several others. Pickerel are rare in the pond and the white perch population is declining. The largest lake trout in Maine was caught on the lake in 1958. It weighed . Icefishing is also done on the lake. Beech Hill Pond was said to be one of the \\"best bets for Maine lake trout\\" by Tom Seymour. It is impossible to fish from the lake's shore, although fishing can be done out on the lake. The pond is a coldwater and warmwater fishery. A total of 14 adult loons and one chick were observed on Beech Hill Pond in 2007 and 2008. There are two nesting families of bald eagles on the lake.

There are three main types of synucleinopathy: Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Other rare disorders, such as various neuroaxonal dystrophies, also have Œ±-synuclein pathologies.  Presentation  The synucleinopathies have shared features of parkinsonism, impaired cognition, sleep disorders, and visual hallucinations. Synucleinopathies can sometimes overlap with tauopathies, possibly because of interaction between the synuclein and tau proteins. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia in which individuals with RBD lose the paralysis of muscles (atonia) that is normal during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and act out their dreams or have other abnormal movements or vocalizations. Abnormal sleep behaviors may appear decades before any other symptoms, often as an early sign of a synucleinopathy. On autopsy, 94 to 98% of individuals with polysomnography-confirmed RBD are found to have a synucleinopathy‚Äîmost commonly DLB or PD. Other symptoms of the specific synucleinopathy usually manifest within 15 years of the diagnosis of RBD, but may emerge up to 50 years after RBD diagnosis. Alpha-synuclein deposits can affect the cardiac muscle and blood vessels. Almost all people with synucleinopathies have cardiovascular dysfunction, although most are asymptomatic. From chewing to defecation, alpha-synuclein deposits affect every level of gastrointestinal function. Symptoms include upper gastrointestinal tract dysfunction such as delayed gastric emptying or lower gastrointestinal dysfunction, such as constipation and prolonged stool transit time. Urinary retention, waking at night to urinate, increased urinary frequency and urgency, and over- or underactive bladder are common in people with synucleinopathies. Sexual dysfunction usually appears early in synucleinopathies, and may include erectile dysfunction, and difficulties achieving orgasm or ejaculating. Diagnosis =Differential diagnosis= Persons with PD are typically less caught up in their visual hallucinations than those with DLB. There is a lower incidence of tremor at rest in DLB than in PD, and signs of parkinsonism in DLB are more symmetrical. In MSA, autonomic dysfunction appears earlier and is more severe, and is accompanied by uncoordinated movements, while visual hallucinations and fluctuating cognition are less common than in DLB. Urinary difficulties are one of the earliest symptoms with MSA, and are often severe. DNA damage Alpha- synuclein modulates DNA repair processes, including the repair of DNA double- strand breaks by the non-homologous end joining pathway. The DNA repair function of alpha-synuclein appears to be compromised in Lewy body inclusion bearing neurons, and this may trigger cell death. Study of synucleinopathy mouse models of Parkinson‚Äôs disease indicates that alpha-synuclein pathogenesis is associated with increased DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage response.

After the publication of her essay, Amherst College began investigating its sexual assault procedures, and women from other college campuses in the United States came forward to file federal complaints under Title IX and to form groups to reduce sexual assault on college campuses. Background In 2011, Epifano was a freshman at Amherst College majoring in African Art history. During her freshman year, she told NPR that she was invited to watch a movie by an acquaintance and fell asleep during the movie (she reported she had not been drinking). When she awoke, she reported that the acquaintance was sexually assaulting her; the next morning she left and tried not to think about the assault. Her alleged assailant was never legally prosecuted or sanctioned by Amherst college. Nine months later she went to one of Amherst College's sexual assault guidance counselors. After some time and after seeing a second guidance counselor, she admitted to thinking about suicide and was forcibly admitted by Amherst College into a psychiatric ward for five days. She returned to school just before the end of the spring semester after she placed a restraining order on the person she alleged committed the assault. She subsequently dropped out of Amherst College and started working on a dude ranch in Wyoming during the fall of 2012. It was during this time that she became frustrated that she had left Amherst College without attempting to improve the support system for victims of sexual assault. She decided to do something about it by writing an essay on her experiences of the assault, with other students, and with sexual assault support system at Amherst College. Epifano's essay On 10 October 2012, The Amherst Student published an essay by Epifano on her personal experience of a sexual assault at Amherst College. She reported that she was raped by a male acquaintance on May 25, 2011 in dormitory on the campus of Amherst College. Nine months after the alleged rape occurred, a friend suggested that she seek counseling. When she eventually did so, she reported in her essay that a campus sexual assault counselor told her \\"In short I was told: No you can't change dorms, there are too many students right now. Pressing charges would be useless, he's about to graduate, there's not much we can do. Are you SURE it was rape?\\" She described how the counseling center focused on her apparent psychological instability and placed her in a psychiatric hospital. Within the first week of publication of the essay, it received over 370,000 hits. Response Immediately following the publication of Epifano's essay, Amherst College began reviewing its policies for handling sexual assault cases, brought in psychological experts, assigned new investigators, and started a \\"sexual respect\\" website. Amherst President Carolyn \\"Biddy\\" Martin stated \\"We need to do everything in our power to become a leader in encouraging victims to report sexual assault\\". Amherst College formed a Special Oversight Committee on Sexual Misconduct, which produced a critical report of the way sexual assault cases are handled at Amherst. In November, 2013, Epifano and an anonymous former female former student filed a 113-page federal sexual assault complaint under Title IX. Subsequently, other complaints were filed under Title IX and the Clery Act. The complaints allege that Amherst and other schools violated Title IX by not providing a college environment that protects female students from discrimination and that the schools also violated the Clery Act by not keeping and making public information on campus crimes. After the publication of Epifano's essay, a group of activists formed \\"Know Your IX\\" website and group. NPR contacted Amherst President Martin during the first week of April 2014 for comment and she replied: Criticism Wendy Kaminer writing for The Atlantic questioned how accurately Epifano could recall all of the events she reported in her essay. She concludes that \\"I'm not criticizing or judging Epifano for being acutely frightened and depressed\\" but rather that \\"I'm simply suggesting that different women react differently, according to their different circumstances, strengths and vulnerabilities.\\" References External links * Epifano‚Äôs essay * KNOW YOUR IX Category:Living people Category:Amherst College alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Sexual abuse ","title":"Angie Epifano"},{"id":"42420943","text":"Cadets Club is a Mauritian football club based in Quatre Bornes.

The technique uses inelastic scattering of light when it encounters acoustic phonons in a crystal, a process known as Brillouin scattering, to determine phonon energies and therefore interatomic potentials of a material. The scattering occurs when an electromagnetic wave interacts with a density wave, photon-phonon scattering. This technique is commonly used to determine the elastic properties of materials in mineral physics and material science. Brillouin spectroscopy can be used to determine the complete elastic tensor of a given material which is required in order to understand the bulk elastic properties. Comparison with Raman spectroscopy An illustration of an example Brillouin and Raman spectrum. In practice the distinction between Brillouin and Raman spectroscopy depends on which frequencies we choose to sample. Brillouin scattering generally lies within the GHz frequency regime. Brillouin spectroscopy is similar to Raman spectroscopy in many ways; in fact the physical scattering processes involved are identical. However, the type of information gained is significantly different. The process observed in Raman spectroscopy, Raman scattering, primarily involves high frequency molecular vibrational modes. Information relating to modes of vibration, such as the six normal modes of vibration of the carbonate ion, (CO3)2‚àí, can be obtained through a Raman spectroscopy study shedding light on structure and chemical composition,Buzgar N., Apopei A., (2009) The Raman study of certain carbonates. Geologie. Tomul LV, 2, 97-112. whereas Brillouin scattering involves the scattering of photons by low frequency phonons providing information regarding elastic properties.Bass J. (1995) Elasticity of minerals, glasses, and melts. Mineral Physics and Crystallography: a Handbook of Physical Constants, AGU Reference Shelf 2, 45-63. Optical phonons and molecular vibrations measured in Raman spectroscopy typically have wavenumbers between 10 and 4000 cm‚àí1, while phonons involved in Brillouin scattering are on the order of 0.1‚Äì6 cm‚àí1. This roughly two order of magnitude difference becomes obvious when attempting to perform Raman spectroscopy vs. Brillouin spectroscopy experiments. In Brillouin scattering, and similarly Raman scattering, both energy and momentum are conserved in the relations: :\\\\hbar\\\\Omega= \\\\pm\\\\hbar(\\\\omega_i-\\\\omega_s ) : q = (k_t-k_s) Where and are the angular frequency and wavevector of the photon, respectively. While the phonon angular frequency and wavevector are and . The subscripts and denote the incident and scattered waves. The first equation is the result of the application of the conservation of energy to the system of the incident photon, the scattered photon, and the interacting phonon. Applying conservation of energy also sheds light upon the frequency regime in which Brillouin scattering occurs. The energy imparted on an incident photon from a phonon is relatively small, generally around 5-10% that of the photon's energy. Given an approximate frequency of visible light, ~1014 GHz, it is easy to see that Brillouin scattering generally lies in the GHz regime. The second equation describes the application of conservation of momentum to the system. The phonon, which is either generated or annihilated, has a wavevector which is a linear combination of the incident and scattered wavevectors. This orientation will become more apparent and important when the orientation of the experimental setup is discussed. Geometric relationships between longitudinal, L, and transverse, T, acoustic waves. The equations describe both the constructive (Stokes) and destructive (anti-Stokes) interactions between a photon and phonon. Stokes scattering describes the interaction scenario in which the material absorbs the photon, creating a phonon, inelastically emitting a photon with a lower energy than that of the absorbed photon. Anti-Stokes scattering describes the interaction scenario in which the incoming photon absorbs a phonon, phonon annihilation, and a photon with a higher energy than that of absorbed photon is emitted. The figure illustrates the differences between Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering along with Stokes and anti-Stokes interactions as is seen in experimental data. The figure depicts three important details. The first is the Rayleigh line, the peak which has been suppressed at 0 cm‚àí1. This peak is a result of Rayleigh scattering, a form of elastic scattering from the incident photons and the sample. Rayleigh scattering occurs when the induced polarization of the atoms, resulting from the incident photons, does not couple with possible vibrational modes of the atoms. The resulting emitted radiation has the same energy as the incident radiation, meaning no frequency shift is observed. This peak is generally quite intense and is not of direct interest for Brillouin spectroscopy. In an experiment, the incident light is most often a high power laser. This results in a very intense Rayleigh peak which has the ability to wash out the Brillouin peaks of interest. In order to adjust for this, most spectrum are plotted with the Rayleigh peak either filtered out or suppressed. The second noteworthy aspect of the figure is the distinction between Brillouin and Raman peaks. As previously mentioned, Brillouin peaks range from 0.1 cm‚àí1 to approximately 6 cm‚àí1 while Raman scattering wavenumbers ranges from 10‚Äì10000 cm‚àí1. As Brillouin and Raman spectroscopy probe two fundamentally different interaction regimes this is not too large of an inconvenience. The fact that Brillouin interactions are such low frequency however creates technical challenges when performing experiments for which a Fabry-Perot interferometer are usually used in order to overcome. A Raman spectroscopy system is generally less technically complicated and can be performed with a diffraction grating‚Äìbased spectrometer. In some cases a single grating‚Äìbased spectrometer has been used to collect both Brillouin and Raman spectra from a sample. The figure also highlights the difference between Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. Stokes scattering, positive photon creation, is displayed as a positive shift in wavenumber. Anti-Stokes scattering, negative photon annihilation, is displayed as a negative shift in wavenumber. The locations of peaks are symmetric about the Rayleigh line because they correspond to the same energy level transition but of a different sign.Muller U. P., Sanctuary R., Seck P., Kruger J. ‚ÄìCh. (2005) Scanning Brillouin microscopy: acoustic microscopy at gigahertz frequencies. Archives des Sciences Naturelles, Physiques et Mathematiques, 46, 11-25. http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/13482 In practice, six Brillouin lines of interest are generally seen in a Brillouin spectrum. Acoustic waves have three polarization directions one longitudinal and two transverse directions each being orthogonal to the others. Solids can be considered nearly incompressible, within an appropriate pressure regime, as a result, longitudinal waves, which are transmitted via compression parallel to the propagation direction, can transmit their energy through the material easily and thus travel quickly. The motion of transverse waves, on the other hand, is perpendicular to the propagation direction and is thus less easily propagated through the medium. As a result, longitudinal waves travel more quickly through solids than transverse waves. An example of this can be seen in quartz with an approximate acoustic longitudinal wave velocity of 5965 m/s and transverse wave velocity of 3750 m/s. Fluids cannot support transverse waves. As a result, transverse wave signals are not found in Brillouin spectra of fluids. The equation shows the relationship between acoustic wave velocity, , angular frequency , and phonon wavenumber, . :V=\\\\Omega /q According to the equation, acoustic waves with varying speeds will appear on the Brillouin spectra with varying wavenumbers: faster waves with higher magnitude wavenumbers and slower waves with smaller wavenumbers. Therefore, three distinct Brillouin lines will be observable. In isotropic solids, the two transverse waves will be degenerate, as they will be traveling along elastically identical crystallographic planes. In non-isotropic solids the two transverse waves will be distinguishable from one another, but not distinguishable as being horizontally or vertically polarized without a deeper understanding of the material being studied. They are then generically labeled transverse 1 and transverse 2. Applications Cubic elastic tensor after symmetry reduction. Brillouin spectroscopy is a valuable tool for determining the complete elastic tensor, c_{ijkl}, of solids. The elastic tensor is an 81 component 3x3x3x3 matrix which, through Hooke's Law, relates stress and strain within a given material. The number of independent elastic constants found within the elastic tensor can be reduced through symmetry operations and depends on the symmetry of a given material ranging from 2 for non-crystalline substances or 3 for cubic crystals to 21 for systems with triclinic symmetry. The tensor is unique to given materials and thus must be independently determined for each material in order to understand their elastic properties. The elastic tensor is especially important to mineral physicist and seismologists looking to understand the bulk, polycrystalline, properties of deep Earth minerals. It is possible to determine elastic properties of materials such as the adiabatic bulk modulus, K_s, without first finding the complete elastic tensor through techniques such as the determination of an equation of state through a compression study. Elastic properties found in this way, however, do not scale well to bulk systems such as those found within rock assemblages in the Earth's mantle. In order to calculate the elastic properties of bulk material with randomly oriented crystals the elastic tensor is needed. Using Equation 3, it is possible to determine the sound velocity through a material. In order to obtain the elastic tensor the Christoffel Equation needs to be applied: c_{ijkl} \\\\Lambda_{kl}=\\\\lambda_{kl} \\\\delta_{kl} p_{kl} The Christoffel Equation is essentially an eigenvalue problem which relates the elastic tensor, c_{ijkl}, to the crystal orientation and the orientation of the incident light, \\\\Lambda_{kl}, to a matrix, \\\\lambda_{kl}, whose eigenvalues are equal to œÅV2, where œÅ is density and V is acoustic velocity. The polarization matrix, p_{kl}, contains the corresponding polarizations of the propagating waves. Relationships between elastic constants and X for cubic systems depending upon the direction of propagation of the phonon, , and the eigenvector of the phonon, , where = longitudinal and = transverse acoustic waves. Using the equation, where \\\\Lambda_{kl} and p_{ij} are known from the experimental setup and is determined from the Brillouin spectra, it is possible to determine c_{ijkl}, given the density of the material. For specific symmetries the relationship between a specific combination of elastic constants, , and acoustic wave velocities, œÅV2, have been determined and tabulated.Cummins & Schoen, 1972, Laser Handbook vol 2 For example, in a cubic system c_{ijkl} reduces to 3 independent components. Equation 5 shows the complete elastic tensor for a cubic material. The relations between the elastic constants and can be found in Table 1. In a cubic material it is possible to determine the complete elastic tensor from pure longitudinal and pure transverse phonon velocities. In order make the above calculations the phonon wavevector, , must be pre-determined from the geometry of the experiment. There are three main Brillouin spectroscopy geometries: 90 degree scattering, backscattering, and platelet geometry. Frequency shift The frequency shift of the incident laser light due to Brillouin scattering is given by ::\\\\Delta \\\\omega = v_\\\\text{s} \\\\frac{2n\\\\omega}{c} \\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} where \\\\omega is the angular frequency of the light, v_\\\\text{s} is the velocity of acoustic waves (speed of sound in the medium), n is the index of refraction, c is the vacuum speed of light, and \\\\theta is the angle of incidence of the light.

The episode maintained the previous week's 18-49 rating/share of 1.5/4, with 3.98 million American viewers watching on Fox.  Episode summary  Joseph von Fraunhofer's discovery of gaps in the spectrum of visible light from the sun, the lines uniquely corresponding to specific atomic elements, would lead to the use of astronomical spectroscopy to determine the composition of distant stellar objects. This episode explores the wave theory of light as studied by mankind, noting that light has played an important role in scientific progress, with such early experiments from over 2000 years ago involving the camera obscura by the Chinese philosopher Mozi. Tyson describes the work of the 11th century Arabic scientist Ibn al-Haytham, considered to be one of the first to postulate on the nature of light and optics leading to the concept of the telescope, as well as one of the first researchers to use the scientific method. Tyson proceeds to discuss the nature of light as discovered by mankind. Work by Isaac Newton using refraction through prisms demonstrated that light was composed of the visible spectrum, while findings of William Herschel in the 19th century showed that light also consisted of infrared rays. Joseph von Fraunhofer would later come to discover that by magnifying the spectrum of visible light, gaps in the spectrum would be observed. These Fraunhofer lines would later be determined to be caused by the absorption of light by electrons in moving between atomic orbitals when it passed through atoms, with each atom having a characteristic signature due to the quantum nature of these orbitals. This since has led to the core of astronomical spectroscopy, allowing astronomers to make observations about the composition of stars, planets, and other stellar features through the spectral lines, as well as observing the motion and expansion of the universe, and the existence of dark matter.

The Japanese macaque (Japanese Nihonzaru Êó•Êú¨Áåø), characterized by brown-grey fur, red face, red buttocks, and short tail, inhabits all of the islands in the Japanese archipelago except northernmost Hokkaido. Throughout most of Japanese history, monkeys were a familiar animal seen in fields and villages, but with habitat lost through urbanization of modern Japan, they are presently limited to mountainous regions. Monkeys are a historically prominent feature in the religion, folklore, and art of Japan, as well as in Japanese proverbs and idiomatic expressions. The Japanese cultural meaning of the monkey has diachronically changed. Beginning with 8th-century historical records, monkeys were sacred mediators between gods and humans; around the 13th century, monkeys also became a \\"scapegoat\\" metaphor for tricksters and dislikable people. These roles gradually shifted until the 17th century, when the monkey usually represented the negative side of human nature, particularly people who foolishly imitate others. Japanese anthropologist Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:59‚Äì60) explains the idiom saru wa ke ga sanbon tarinai (Áåø„ÅØÊØõ„Åå‰∏âÊú¨Ë∂≥„Çä„Å™„ÅÑ, \\"a monkey is [a human] minus three pieces of hair\\"): \\"The literal meaning of this saying is that the monkey is a lowly animal trying to be a human and therefore is to be laughed at. However, the saying is understood by the Japanese to portray the monkey as representing undesirable humans that are to be ridiculed.\\" Language Saru (Áåø) is the most common \\"monkey\\" word in the Japanese language. This Japanese kanji Áåø has on'yomi \\"Chinese readings\\" of en or on (from Chinese yu√°n), and kun'yomi \\"Japanese readings\\" of saru or Old Japanese mashi or mashira in classical Japanese literature. The archaic literary ete reading in etek≈ç (ÁåøÂÖ¨, \\"Mr. Monkey\\") is phonetically anomalous. The etymologies of Japanese saru and mashira are uncertain. For saru (Áåø), Yamanaka (1976:253) notes Ainu saro \\"monkey\\", which Batchelor (1905:22) explains as, \\"from sara (a tail) and o (to bear), hence saro means 'having a tail'.\\" Yamanaka suggests an etymology from Mongolian samji \\"monkey\\", transformed from sam > sanu > salu, with a possible ma- prefix evident in archaic Japanese masaru, mashira, and mashi pronunciations (of Áåø). For mashira (Áåø), Yamanaka (1985:410) cites Turner (1962:568) that Indo-Aryan mark√°ta \\"monkey\\" derives from Sanskrit marka·π≠a (‡§Æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï‡§ü) \\"monkey\\" (cf. meerkat), with cognates including Pali makka·π≠a, Oriya mƒÅka·πõa, and Gujarti mƒÅk·πõ≈©. Women dressed as monkey trainers for New Year's dancing, Utagawa Toyokuni, c. 1800. Saru originally meant the \\"Japanese macaque\\" specifically, but was semantically extended to mean \\"simian\\", \\"monkey\\", \\"ape\\". The en or on Sino- Japanese reading is seen in words such as: *shin'en (ÂøÉÁåø, lit. \\"heart-/mind- monkey\\") (Buddhist) \\"unsettled; restless; indecisive\\" *enjin (Áåø‰∫∫ \\"monkey human\\") \\"ape-man\\" *shinenrui (ÁúüÁåøÈ°û \\"true monkey category\\") \\"simian\\" *ruijinen (È°û‰∫∫Áåø \\"category human monkey\\") \\"anthropoid; troglodyte\\" *oen (Âæ°Áåø, \\"great monkey\\") \\"menstruation\\", in comparison to a monkey's red buttocks The native saru reading is used in many words, including some proper names: *sarumawashi (ÁåøÂõû„Åó, lit. \\"monkey revolving\\") \\"monkey trainer; monkey show\\" *sarumane (ÁåøÁúü‰ºº, \\"monkey imitation\\") \\"superficial imitation; monkey see monkey do\\" *sarujie (ÁåøÁü•ÊÅµ, \\"monkey wisdom\\") \\"shortsighted cleverness\\" *Sarugaku (ÁåøÊ•Ω, \\"monkey music\\") \\"a traditional form of comic theater, popular in Japan during the 11th to 14th centuries\\" *Sarushima (ÁåøÂ≥∂, \\"monkey island\\") \\"a small island in Tokyo Bay\\" *Sarumino (ÁåøËìë \\"monkey straw-raincoat\\"), \\"a 1691 anthology of haiku poetry\\" Personal names with the word saru \\"monkey\\" reflect semantically positive meanings of the monkey (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:52). Japanese scholars consider Sarumaru Day≈´ (Áåø‰∏∏Â§ßÂ§´) to be either \\"a legendary poet of the Genkei period (877‚Äì884)\\" or \\"a name given to a number of itinerant priest-poets who formed a group named Sarumaru\\". Sarumatsu (ÁåøÊùæ) was the childhood nickname of the daimy≈ç Uesugi Kenshin (1530‚Äì1578). While most Japanese \\"monkey\\" words have positive denotations, there are a few pejorative exceptions (Carr 1993:167). One is a native Japanese term: yamazaru (Â±±Áåø, \\"mountain/wild monkey\\") \\"country bumpkin; hick; hillbilly\\". Two are Sino-Japanese loanwords for foreign monkeys: sh≈çj≈ç (Áå©„ÄÖ \\"orangutan\\") \\"a mythical red-faced, red-haired god of wine, who was always drunk and dancing merrily\\" or \\"heavy drinker; drunk\\" and hihi (Áãí„ÄÖ \\"baboon\\") \\"satyr; lecher; dirty old man\\". This Japanese Sh≈çj≈ç legend derives from Chinese traditions that the xingxing (Áå©Áå© \\"orangutan\\") is fond of wine. Monkeys are a common trope in Japanese idioms: *ken'en no naka (Áä¨Áåø„ÅÆ‰ª≤, lit. \\"dog and monkey relationship\\") \\"a bad relationship; like cats and dogs\\" *saru no shiri warai (Áåø„ÅÆÂ∞ªÁ¨ë„ÅÑ, \\"monkey laughing at someone's buttocks\\") \\"laughing at someone's weakness while disregarding one's own weakness; the pot calling the kettle black\\" *saru mo ki kara ochiru (Áåø„ÇÇÊú®„Åã„ÇâËêΩ„Å°„Çã, \\"even monkeys fall from trees\\") \\"anyone can make a mistake\\" The opaque idiom t≈çr≈ç ga ono, enk≈ç ga tsuki (Ëü∑ËûÇ„ÅåÊñßÁåøÁå¥„ÅåÊúà, lit. \\"axes for a praying mantis, moon for a monkey\\") means (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:64), \\"A praying mantis trying to crush the wheel of a cart with its forelegs (the axes) is portrayed as being as ridiculous as a monkey mistaking the reflection of the moon in the water for the moon itself and trying to capture it\\". Chinese monkey lore When the Japanese adapted Chinese characters to write Japanese, such as using Chinese yuan Áåø \\"gibbon; monkey\\" for saru \\"macaque; monkey\\", they concurrently adopted many Chinese monkey customs and traditions. Some notable examples are: the Year of the Monkey in the Chinese zodiac; the belief that \\"stable monkeys\\" will protect the health and safety of horses (see below); the traditional Chinese symbolic contrast between the superior, supernatural gibbon and the inferior, foolish macaque; and mythological monkeys like the Kakuen \\"a legendary monkey-man that abducts and rapes human women\\" (< Chinese jueyuan ÁéÉÁåø) and the Sh≈çj≈ç \\"a god of wine with a red face and long, red hair\\" (< Chinese xingxing Áå©Áå© \\"monkey; orangutan\\").

Monkey Jiz≈ç statue at Hie Shrine in Tokyo Painting of Sh≈çmen Kong≈ç and Three Wise Monkeys. Three Wise Monkeys at T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ shrine in Nikk≈ç. Monkey deities are common among Japanese religious beliefs, including Shinto, notably Sann≈ç Shinto, K≈çshin, and Japanese Buddhism. In ancient Shinto tradition, Sarutahiko ≈åkami (ÁåøÁî∞ÂΩ¶Â§ßÁ•û, lit. \\"monkey-field prince great god\\") or Sarutahiko (also pronounced Sarudahiko, Sarutabiko, or Sarudabiko) is a monkey-like God of Crossroads between heaven and earth. Sarutahiko Okami is worshipped at Tsubaki Grand Shrine in Mie and ≈åasahiko Shrine in Tokushima. The two earliest Japanese mytho-histories, the (712) Kojiki (\\"Record of Ancient Matters\\") and the (720) Nihongi (\\"Chronicles of Japan\\"), both record Sarutahiko. One Kojiki chapter mentions him (tr. Chamberlain 1991:139), \\"Now when this Deity Prince of Saruta dwelt at Azaka, he went out fishing, and had his hand caught by a hirabu shell-fish, and was drowned in the brine of the sea.\\" The Nihongi has a more detailed myth about the Crossroad God Sarutahiko no Okami. When the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, said to be the ancestress of the Imperial House of Japan, decided to send her grandson Ninigi and other deities down to earth to govern, she first sent a scout to clear the way, who returned and reported encountering the fearsome Sarutahiko. > There is one God who dwells at the eight-cross-roads of Heaven, the length > of whose nose is seven hands, the length of whose back is more than seven > fathoms. Moreover, a light shines from his mouth and from his posteriors. > His eye-balls are like an eight-hand mirror and have a ruddy glow like the > Aka-kagachi. (tr. Aston 1896:77) Amaterasu chose Ame-no-Uzume as the only god or goddess who could confront Sarutahiko and ask why he was blocking the crossroads between heaven and earth, and said: > \\"Thou art superior to others in the power of thy looks. Thou hadst better go > and question him.\\" So Ame no Uzume forthwith bared her breasts and, pushing > down the band of her garment below her navel, confronted him with a mocking > laugh. [Sarutahiko is shocked and explains that he is waiting to serve as > guide for Ninigi] \\"I have heard that the child of Ama-terasu no Oho-kami is > now about to descend, and therefore I have come respectfully to meet and > attend upon him. My name is Saruta-hiko no Oho-kami.\\" (tr. Aston 1912:77) Sarutahito later marries Ame-no-Uzume. Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:42‚Äì43) lists three factors that identify Sarutahiko as a Monkey Deity: saru means \\"monkey\\", his features \\"include red buttocks, which are a prominent characteristic of Japanese macaques\\", and as macaques gather shellfish at low tide, the Kojiki says his hand got caught in a shell while fishing and \\"a monkey with one hand caught in a shell is a frequent theme of Japanese folktales\\". Another Shinto monkey myth concerns the God of Lightning Raijin who is accompanied by shape- shifting raij≈´ (Èõ∑Áç£,\\"thunder beast\\") ball lightning that sometimes appeared as a monkey. Sarugami (ÁåøÁ•û, lit. \\"monkey god\\") was part of the Sann≈ç Shint≈ç sect, which was based upon the cult of the Mountain God Sann≈ç (Â±±Áéã, \\"mountain king\\") and Tendai Buddhism. Sarugami was Sann≈ç's messenger, and served as an intermediary between deities and humans. Sann≈ç and Sarugami are worshipped at Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in ≈åtsu, Shiga. The Mountain and Monkey Gods Sann≈ç and Sarugami became popular during the early Tokugawa or Edo period. Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who unified Japan in 1590 and ended the Sengoku period, was nicknamed Kosaru (\\"small monkey\\") or Saru (\\"monkey\\"), \\"not only because his face looked like a monkey's, but also because he eagerly sought identification with the monkey\\" (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:44). Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was the first sh≈çgun (1603‚Äì1605) of the Tokugawa shogunate, \\"officially designated the Monkey Deity as the guardian of peace in the nation, and a festival for the deity was elaborately carried out in Edo\\" during his reign (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:44). During this period, a genre of paintings illustrated the Monkey God as a messenger from the Mountain God, depicting him dancing during rice harvesting, or holding a gohei \\"a ritual wand with pendant paper streamers\\" ritualistically used by Shinto priests to summon the spirit of a deity. Thus, Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:44) says, \\"the monkey in these paintings is assigned the role of mediating between deities and humans, just as shamans and priests do.\\" The role of monkeys as mediators is evident within the Japanese K≈çshin folk religion. This eclectic belief system incorporates Daoist beliefs about the sanshi (‰∏âÂ∞∏, \\"Three Corpses\\") \\"evil spirits that live in the human body and hasten death\\", Shinto Sarugami mythology (above), and Buddhist beliefs about simian gods such as the VƒÅnara \\"a monkey-like humanoid\\" in the Ramayana. Sh≈çmen-Kong≈ç (ÈùíÈù¢ÈáëÂâõ, \\"Blue-face Vajra\\" \\"a fearsome, many-armed, K≈çshin guardian deity\\", who was supposedly able to make the Three Corpses sick and thus prevent them from reporting to Heaven, was commonly depicted with two or three monkey attendants. In Daoist-K≈çshin beliefs, the bodily Three Corpses keep records of their host's misdeeds, which they report to Heaven bimonthly on the night gengshen (Japanese k≈çshin) Â∫öÁî≥ \\"57th of the 60 (in the Chinese Sexagenary cycle)\\" while their human host is dreaming. But in a type of karmic loophole, someone who stays awake throughout that day and night can avoid receiving a shorter lifespan for their transgressions. The Japanese version of this custom, K≈çshin-Machi (Â∫öÁî≥ÂæÖ, \\"K≈çshin Waiting\\"), became an all-night party among friends. The sanzaru (‰∏âÁåø \\"three monkeys\\") or English \\"Three Wise Monkeys\\" is a widely known example of monkeys in traditional Japanese culture. Their names are a pun between saru or vocalized zaru \\"monkey\\" and archaic -zaru \\"a negative verb conjugation\\": mizaru, kikazaru, iwazaru (Ë¶ã„Åñ„Çã, ËÅû„Åã„Åñ„Çã, Ë®Ä„Çè„Åñ„Çã, lit. \\"don't see, don't hear, don't speak\\"). The T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ shrine in Nikk≈ç has elaborate relief carvings over the doors, including a famous representation of the Three Wise Monkeys. The Three Wise Monkeys also represent the K≈çshin faith. They are displayed in the Yasaka K≈çshin-d≈ç Temple in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto, dedicated to Sh≈çmen Kong≈ç, known by his nickname K≈çshin-san (Â∫öÁî≥„Åï„Çì) with the -san suffix for \\"Mr.; Ms.; Mrs.\\". This shrine also sells a kind of sarubobo (Áåø„Åº„Åº, \\"monkey baby\\") \\"red, faceless doll amulet\\" called the kukurizaru („Åè„Åè„ÇäÁåø) believed to represent the good luck of monkeys. Ohnuki- Tierney (1987:46‚Äì47) explains the meaning and the role of k≈çshin centered on mediation, \\"between temporal cycles, between humans and deities, and between heaven and earth. It is with this mediating deity that the monkey became associated, thereby further reinforcing the meaning of the monkey as mediator.\\" Saeno kami (Èöú„ÅÆÁ•û, \\"border god\\"), later known as D≈çsojin (ÈÅìÁ•ñÁ•û, \\"road ancestor god\\"), is a Shinto tutelary deity of boundaries, which is usually placed at spatial boundaries, especially the boundary of a community, and is believed to protect people from epidemics and evil spirits. In popular belief, Saeno kami was merged with Shinto Sarutahiko, and later with Buddhist Jiz≈ç or Ksitigarbha \\"the bodhisattva of souls in hell and guardian of children\\". This amalgamation, says Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:48), \\"resulted in stone statues of a monkey wearing a bib, which is a trademark of Jiz≈ç, a guardian Buddha of children.\\" Literature Monkeys are occasionally mentioned in early Japanese literature. Only one of the 4,500 poems in the (8th century) Man'y≈çsh≈´ mentions monkeys. Its author ≈åtomo no Tabito \\"ridicules sober people for having faces as ugly as that of a monkey, while he justifies and praises drunks\\" (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:53). The (c. 787‚Äì824) Nihon Ry≈çiki collection of Buddhist setsuwa has a story about a female saint (LaFleur 1983:42, 169) who first was mockingly called a saru \\"monkey\\" pretending to be something she is not, and later honorifically named with sari \\"ashes of the Buddha\\". Monkey Trainers, Kan≈ç Motonobu, 1520. Utsubozaru (Èù±Áåø, lit. \\"quiver monkey\\") The Monkey Skin Quiver is a ky≈çgen play in which a monkey dances with a lord who has just spared his life. > A Daimy≈ç goes out hunting with his servant Taro Kaja, and on the way they > meet a Monkey Trainer.

(Sebeok 1986:120) The (c. 1596‚Äì1607) Inu makura or The Dog Pillow collection includes the description \\"red leaves dried out like a monkey's buttocks\\" (Áåø„ÅÆÂ∞ªÊú®ÊûØ„Çâ„Åó„Åó„Çâ„Å¨Á¥ÖËëâ„Åã„Å™). Folklore Edo-period Saru Kani Gassen Emaki, emakimono showing the crab and the monkey. Momotar≈ç with his monkey, dog, and pheasant friends, 1886 nishiki-e woodblock edition. Monkeys are a common theme in Japanese folktales and fairy tales. The monkey is a malicious trickster in Saru Kani Gassen (\\"Battle of the Crab and the Monkey\\") over a rice-ball and a persimmon seed (Ozaki 1903:205‚Äì215). > In one widespread version, the monkey takes a rice ball from a crab in > exchange for a persimmon seed, explaining to the crab that there is nothing > left of a rice ball after its consumption, whereas a persimmon seed will > grow and bear fruit. When the crab manages to grow the tree, which bears > much fruit, the crab asks the monkey to fetch a persimmon. The monkey climbs > up the tree and throws a persimmon at the crab, injuring or killing her, > depending on the version. Eventually, the crab (or her children, in the > version in which she is killed) and her sympathizers (a chestnut, a needle, > a wasp, a mortar, dung, and so forth, depending upon the region) take > revenge on the monkey. (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:54) In Momotar≈ç (\\"Peach Boy\\") (Ozaki 1903:244‚Äì261), the hero is befriended by three talking animals, a monkey, a dog, and a pheasant. The monkey serves as a mediator in several folktales. The (13th century) Zatsudansh≈´ has a story about a diligent man and a lazy man who once lived at the foot of a mountain. > The hard-working man worked in the field from early morning till evening to > grow soybeans and red beans. One day he became tired and fell asleep, > whereupon monkeys came and thought he was a Buddha. They gave him yams and > other offerings and went back to the mountain. The man took the offerings > home. Upon hearing this story, the wife of the lazy man urged her husband to > do the same. The monkeys carried him across the river to ensconce him there. > While they were carrying him on their arms, the monkeys said, \\"We should > raise our hakama [a skirt-like garment for men]\\", and they stroked their fur > to imitate the gesture of raising the hakama. Upon seeing this, the man > laughed. The monkeys said that he was a man, instead of a Buddha, and threw > him into the river. He was drenched, swallowed a great deal of water, and > narrowly escaped his death. Upon hearing of the incident, his wife became > enraged. \\"One should never engage in superficial imitation of others.\\" (tr. > Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:51) These monkeys act as \\"sacred mediators who on behalf of the Mountain Deity punish a lazy man and his wife for engaging in superficial imitation of their neighbors, while they themselves are imitating humans\\". Saru Jiz≈ç (ÁåøÂú∞Ëîµ, \\"Monkey Jizo\\") was a later version of this tale in which the monkeys mistake both men for a Jiz≈ç Buddha rather than simply a Buddha (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:52). Some folktales portray the monkey as a trickster who tries to outsmart others. Take for instance, Kurage honenashi (Ê∞¥ÊØçÈ™®„Å™„Åó) \\"Boneless Jellyfish\\" (Chamberlain 1887). When the Dragon King hears that eating a live monkey's liver is the only medicine that will save his queen from dying, he sends his trusted servant fish to cross the ocean, go to the monkey-land, and convince a live monkey to return to the dragon-land. While they are traveling across the ocean, the monkey learns that the king will cut out his liver, and tells the fish that he left his liver hanging on a tree in monkey-land, where they return to find the tree empty. When the fish swims back to dragon-land and reports what happened, the king realizes the monkey's deception, and orders his officers to break every bone in the fish's body and beat him to a jelly, which is why jellyfish do not have bones. Art Monkey thief running from animals holding sticks, Ch≈çj≈´-jinbutsu-giga, c. 12th century. The first gibbon in Japan, (1856) Kenkad≈ç zarsuroku, illustration by Mori Sosen. Monkeys are a traditional motif in Japanese art. The (12th and 13th centuries) Ch≈çj≈´- jinbutsu-giga picture scrolls depict anthropomorphic animals, notably monkeys and rabbits bathing, monkeys and rabbits wrestling, and a monkey thief running from rabbits and frogs with sticks. Since the gibbon's habitat did not include Japan, the Japanese were unfamiliar with its long-limbed, long-tailed appearance until the 13th century, mainly through the paintings of the Song dynasty Zen priest and artist Muqi (ÁâßÊ∫™, Japanese Mokkei ÁâßË∞ø), who immigrated to Kyoto. Muqi's \\"work was eagerly studied in Japan, and a number of painters adopted his calligraphic style of rendering the gibbon\\" (van Gulik 1967:97). Muqi's masterful \\"Guanyin\\", \\"Monkeys\\" (depicting a mother and infant gibbons), and \\"Crane\\" scrolls, which are one of the National Treasures of Japan, became the model for drawing gibbons. Many prominent Edo-period (1603‚Äì1867) painters, including Hasegawa T≈çhaku, Kusumi Morikage, and Kan≈ç Tsunenobu, who had never seen gibbons, depicted them following the Bokkei-zaru (ÁâßË∞øÁåø) \\"Muqi's gibbons\\" artistic tradition (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:26). Mori Sosen (1747‚Äì1821), who was the \\"undisputed master\\" (van Gulik 1967:98) of painting the Japanese macaque, influenced later paintings of gibbons, which, in the absence of live models, were sometimes represented with the macaque's red face and brown fur. Muqi's gibbons were usually drawn in nature, while Japanese macaques were often depicted among humans or human-made objects. Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:27) notes that gibbons \\"represented nature, which in folk Shintoism signified deities\\" and also \\"represented the Chinese art tradition (kanga), which in turn represented the Chinese, who were then the most significant foreigners.\\" She (1987:28‚Äì29) posits four levels symbolized by Japanese macaque/gibbon contrast: Japanese/foreigners, humans/deities, culture/nature, and self/other. The Kenkad≈ç zarsuroku (ËíπËë≠Â†ÇÈõúÈåÑ, 1856), by Kimura Kenkad≈ç (Êú®ÊùëËíπËë≠Â†Ç), records the first gibbon imported to Japan, and includes a calligraphic drawing by Mori Sosen. In 1809, a gibbon was exhibited in the D≈çtonbori red-light district of Osaka. > Although we have heard the word \\"gibbon\\" [en or saru Áå®] since olden times, > and seen pictures of him, we never have seen a live specimen, and therefore > a large crowd assembled to see this gibbon. Generally he resembles a large > macaque, and figure and fur are very similar. The face is black, the fur > grey with a touch of brown. The Hollander \\"Captain\\" Hendrik Doeff [i.e., the > Dutch Dejima trading post commissioner, Hendrik Doeff] who was then staying > here said that this gibbon occurs on the island of Java where it is called > \\"wau-wau\\". Truly an extraordinary sight! (tr. van Gulik 1967:98) Van Gulik suggests this Indonesian owa jawa \\"silvery gibbon\\" specimen was brought to Japan on a Dutch ship. As the Monkey is part of the Chinese zodiac, which has been used for centuries in Japan, the creature was sometimes portrayed in paintings of the Edo period as a tangible metaphor for a particular year. The 19th-century artist and samurai Watanabe Kazan created a painting of a macaque. During the Edo period, numerous netsuke, tsuba, and other artifacts were decorated with monkeys. Cuisine Eating monkey meat, which is a long-standing tradition in China, is uncommon in Japanese culture. Archaeological excavations have found monkey bones at sites dated from the hunting-gathering J≈çmon period (c. 14,000‚Äì300 BCE) but not at sites from the agricultural Yayoi period (300 BCE-250 CE) and later. Besides being a source of food for the hunters, monkeys were a menace to farmers because they stole crops. Since the avoidance of monkey meat infers people seeing the proximity between monkeys and themselves, Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:56) concludes that Japanese beliefs about the \\"semideified status and the positive role of mediation between humans and deities\\" began in the Yayoi era. Buddhist thought affected some Japanese attitudes toward monkeys; the Nihongi (Aston 1896:329) records that in 676, Emperor Tenmu issued a law the prohibited eating the meat of cattle, horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens. Even today, in the regions northeast of the Ry≈çhaku Mountains in Ishikawa Prefecture, \\"hunters observe no taboo in regard to monkey hunting, while those in the regions southwest of the mountain range observe numerous taboos\\" (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:57). Horse guardian and healer Following Chinese traditions that keeping a monkey in a stable would protect horses from diseases and accidents, the Japanese gave monkeys the important role of horse guardians, honorifically called the umayagami (Âé©Á•û, \\"stables god\\"). This belief gave rise to two related practices (Ohnuki-Tierney 1987:48‚Äì49). First, both samurais and farmers covered their quivers with monkey hides so as to harness the protective power of the monkey over horses. Second, people drew horse pictures on ema (ÁµµÈ¶¨, lit. \\"picture horse\\") \\"votive wooden plaques\\" and offered them at Shinto shrines to ensure the health of their horses. \\"A large number of ema from various historical periods and regions of Japan depict monkeys pulling horses, providing rich evidence that the monkey functioned as guardian of horses.\\" Monkeys were believed to scare away other animals and pests, and farmers in southern Japan fed monkeys in order to protect their fields. The K≈çjien dictionary says sarumawashi (ÁåøÂõû„Åó) \\"monkey trainer\\" derives from saruhiki (ÁåøÊõ≥„Åç \\"monkey puller\\"), and quotes Japanese folklore scholar Kunio Yanagita that trainers were also originally bai (È¶¨Âåª \\"horse doctors\\"). Yanagita also described the ancient T≈çhoku region custom of umayazaru (Âé©Áåø \\"stables monkey\\") that was mentioned in the Ry≈çjin Hish≈ç and Kokon Chomonj≈´. This \\"stable monkey\\" originally referred to monkeys living in stables in order to protect the health and safety of horses, and later referred to putting up a symbolic monkey skull, paw, or picture. The monkey's role in healing was not limited to horses, but also extended to monkey deities and monkey medicines (Ohnuki- Tierney 1987:50). The supernatural beings associated with the monkey‚Äîk≈çshin, saeno kami, and jiz≈ç‚Äî\\"are all assigned the role of healing.\\" Many parts of the monkey's body have been used as medicine, since at least the 6th century. \\"Even today, a charred monkey's head, pounded into powder, is taken as medicine for illnesses of the head and brain, including mental illnesses, mental retardation, and headaches.\\" Furthermore, representations of monkeys are believed to have healing powers. Three Wise Monkey figurines are used as charms to prevent illnesses. Kukurizaru \\"small stuffed monkey amulets\\" are thought to be \\"efficacious in treating various other illnesses, as well as childbirth.\\" Gallery File:Kukurizaru talismans and monkey statue (Yasaka Koshindo Temple, Kyoto).jpgKukuizaru and a monkey statue at Yasaka K≈çshin-d≈ç.

History =Maidstone Barracks= Maidstone Barracks: the surviving former officers' quarters (main block), flanked by commanding officer's rooms and the officers' mess. Permanent barracks were first established in Maidstone as part of the British response to the threat of the French Revolution in around 1798. Maidstone Barracks was a major cavalry barracks at a stationing point between London and the Kent coast (along which several more cavalry barracks were established in the 1790s). The barracks buildings were constructed of timber for speedy assembly, an approach taken at a number of other such establishments around the country hastily built (for both cavalry and infantry) at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars. Later, in peacetime, Maidstone Barracks served as the cavalry depot, for inducting new recruits. It emerged to become the Army Riding School in 1835. In 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the 50th (West Kent) Regiment of Foot and the 97th (The Earl of Ulster's) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the 50th and 97th regiments amalgamated to form the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment with its depot in the barracks in 1881. The old barracks began to fall into disrepair and were decommissioned in 1936; although the barracks blocks were demolished in 1991, the Officers‚Äô Mess still survives as the White Rabbit Public House in Sandling Road. Apart from the brick chimneys and slate roof, the building is entirely made of wood, and is the last remaining example of a type of building designed by the Barrack Department in the 1790s to be erected in a hurry, as required to house troops of cavalry or regiments of infantry ready for deployment. =Invicta Park= An adjacent site, just a few hundred yards north, was acquired from the Lushington family in 1936 shortly before the outset of the Second World War and a hutted camp known as Invicta Lines (reflecting Invicta, the motto of Kent) was built there. The new barracks became the depot of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment but were then demoted to the status of out-station to the Home Counties Brigade depot at Howe Barracks in Canterbury in 1959. The Regimental Headquarters of 36 Engineer Regiment have been based at the barracks since 1959. The current barracks were built between 1965 and 1966. In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the site would close in 2027.

Hackett grew up in Sheffield, where he attended De La Salle College, then entered journalism with the Sheffield Telegraph in 1945. He spent 1947 to 1949 in national service with the Royal Navy, then resumed his career, joining the Daily Herald in 1954, then quickly moving to Illustrated, where he was Deputy Editor. In 1958, he moved again to the Daily Express, then the Daily Mail, before becoming Art Editor on The Observer.\\"HACKETT, Dennis William\\", Who Was Who Joining the glossy magazine Queen as Deputy Editor in 1962, Hackett later served as Editor but in 1965 was poached by Nova,\\"Nova 1965-1975, by David Gibbs (Editor), David Hillman (Compiler), Harri Peccinotti (Photographer)\\". Pavilion Books, 1993. which soon became regarded as the sharpest consumer magazine of its day. Together with visionary art director Harri Peccinotti, he swiftly established Nova as an influential must-read for the movers and shakers of Swinging London, with men as well as the original target audience of women becoming devotees of its heady mixture of social issues and cutting- edge fashion and modern lifestyle features. He stood down in 1969 to become a director of the International Publishing Corporation (IPC Newspapers) where the chief title was the Daily Mirror, then Britain‚Äôs biggest-selling red-top tabloid at 5 million copies daily. Hackett‚Äôs key task was to launch an irreverent midweek colour supplement, a challenge which was arguably of greater cultural significance than Nova. The Mirror was not only a serious- minded left-wing daily paper, but also in Cudlipp‚Äôs view, ‚Äúthe first quality popular paper‚Äù.\\"Newspaper Journalism by Peter Cole, Tony Harcup\\". Sage Publications, 2010. Within that decade, only quality newspapers had launched glossy colour supplements (Sunday Times, Sunday Telegraph, Observer), all of which had delivered boosts to their papers‚Äô circulations. Mirror Magazine published on Wednesdays and it reflected all of Hackett‚Äôs chutzpah and sense of zeitgeist, one issue deciding on a future with the Butlins Redcoats for the 21-year-old Prince of Wales. Hackett hired a youthful editorial team led by Mike Molloy, who went on to edit the Mirror itself. Others who made their reputations here included Eve Pollard on fashion (later editor of the Sunday Mirror and Sunday Express), Jeffrey Bernard as low-life columnist, Delia Smith in her first writing role as cook, playwright Keith Waterhouse likewise writing his first columns, as well as screenwriter Arthur Hopcraft and the astrologer Patric Walker.\\"Patric Walker ‚Äì ‚Äòthe world's greatest astrologer‚Äô\\". Independent obituary, 9 October 1995. The magazine made waves for popular journalism, but closed one year after launch, not for lack of reader appeal, but because of faulty budgeting from the outset. At 5 million copies, this was the longest magazine run in the country using high-quality gravure presses and it had not been foreseen that those four-colour copper cylinders printing on the machines at Odhams Press in Watford would wear out halfway through the run. From the start, this doubled the weekly engraving bill in what was then the luxury printing process. Mirror Magazine closed in 1970 with a loss of ¬£7million ‚Äì an astonishing miscalculation by Hugh Cudlipp‚Äôs company.\\"Pressures on the Press, by Charles Wintour\\". Andre Deutsch, 1972. Hackett's reputation was undimmed and he held numerous positions during the 1970s, including an associate editorship of the Daily Express, while writing books on the Bemrose Corporation and Ford Motor Company. In the 1980s, Hackett became a television critic, working first at The Times, then for The Tablet. As a consultant, he organised the launch of You, the Mail on Sunday's colour supplement,Roy Greenslade, Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda, p.480 then moved to Today, acting as Editor-in-Chief for a period in 1987. He had some success in the role, calling for tactical voting in the 1987 general election, to benefit the Social Democratic Party.Roy Greenslade, Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda, p.481 However, he soon left to become editor of M, The Observer's colour supplement, then in the early 1990s was editor of Management Today.

Almost all of these have been in the United States of America except for the notable exception in 1985 which was held in Okinawa, Japan with virtual every Okinawan Uechi-Ryu Karate-Do master from Okinawa giving seminars and culminating in the participation in the annual All-Okinawa Karate-Do Kumite Championship with all styles of Okinawan Karate competing from all over the world each year. George E. Mattson had been the chief instructor of a karate school in Boston at various location for decades.http://www.womenskaratetour.org/History8.htm Many of his students upon mastery of Uechi-Ryu Karate-Do started successful karate schools in the Boston area and around Massachusetts and the New England area. Many of them including George E. Mattson himself moved to Florida and started successful karate schools in Florida. He currently teaches at his karate school in Mount Dora, Florida.http://mountdorakarate.com/  Early history  Ryuko Tomoyose originally taught George E. Mattson as a young American servicemanhttp://www.womenskaratetour.org/History9.htm for several hours in the evening after his duties on the military base in Okinawa only training occasionally at the Uechi-Ryu Karate-Do headquarters by Kanei Uechi and his other Master students. He was promoted to 1st degree black belt before leaving Okinawa at the end of his service in the military. Ryuko Tomoyose had studied previously with the founders of the other two major Okinawan Karate styles before starting lessons with Kanei Uechi finally. A few months before becoming too ill, Kanbun Uechi returned to Okinawa and taught at his son's karate school in Nago, Okinawa, Japan. During that time, Ryuko Tomoyose studied with Kanbun Uechi and his students there. Ryuko Tomoyose therefore has the distinction of being one of the very few that was a student of all three founders of all three of the major styles of Okinawan Karate, Kanbun Uechi, Chojun Miyagi, and Chosin Chibana. George E. Mattson returned to Okinawa many times and arranged to travel with his students to Okinawa often. Through his continued travel to Okinawa and the seminars sponsored for Okinawan masters to travel to the USA George E. Mattson has been studying under the majority of Uechi-Ryu Karate-Do masters of the 20th century. As a result, he has been among the first to be promoted to each degree of black belt up to his current rank of 10th degree black belt in Uechi-Ryu Karate-Do in the USA.

She was named for Orkney, Saskatchewan. After the war she was purchased and used by the Israeli immigrant movement, then taken over by the nascent Israeli Navy and renamed Mivtah. She was sold by Israel to Ceylon who renamed her Mahasena. Orkney was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class program. She was laid down on 19 May 1943 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt and launched 18 September 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 18 April 1944 at Victoria, British Columbia. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti- submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in Bermuda, Orkney returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia and was assigned to escort group EG 16. She was later transferred to escort group EG 25 as Senior Officer's Ship based out of Derry. She served with the unit until 13 February 1945 when she was involved in a collision with the merchant ship SS Blairnevis in the Irish Sea. Orkney suffered severe damage, requiring her grounding to keep her afloat, while Blairnevis sank as a result of the collision. She was taken to Dunstaffnage, Scotland where repairs were affected until mid-April. She was worked up at Tobermory before returning to Canada in late May 1945 to undergo a tropicalization refit at Louisburg, Nova Scotia in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. The refit was completed 20 October and Orkney performed local duties until being paid off 22 January 1946. She was placed in reserve in Bedford Basin. Postwar service =Israeli Navy= In 1947, Orkney was sold for commercial use as an Israeli immigration ship. She was renamed Violetta and was used as such until she was taken over by the Israeli Navy in 1949. She was renamed Mivtah (, lit. safe haven) with the pennant number K-28. She served with the Israeli Navy until 1958 when she was sold to Ceylon. =Sri Lanka Navy= Ceylon purchased Mivtakh in 1958 but required that the Israeli Navy send personnel with her to teach the Sri Lanka Navy how to use her. She was commissioned in 1959 under her new name Mahasena. She served until 1964, performing goodwill tours around Southeast Asia, when she was sold and broken up at Singapore.

Work  = The illustrated London drawing book, 1852 = The illustrated London drawing book, 1852 In the preface Burn explained, that Art has long been neglected in the educational system. \\"Drawing has been generally looked upon as an accomplishment,\\" Burn said,\\" not considered as an essential ‚Äì as ornamental rather than indispensable in the education of the rising of generation.\\"R.S. Burn The illustrated London drawing book, 1852. p. i‚Äìiv Burn stipulated that \\"so far from looking upon a knowledge of the art of drawing as necessary merely to the artist or designer, we hold that it should form an essential part of general education ‚Äì that its proper place is in the daily school, that its principles and practice should be inculcated in the daily lessons; in short, that equally with reading or writing, so should drawing be deemed one of the branches of every-day tuition...\\" Another attitude toward drawing education was required, according to Burn: \\"A knowledge of drawing is generally imparted by a course of irregular and desultory lessons, aided by a laborious practice, dependent more upon empirical rules than fixed and certain principles. We are aware that there are many honourable exceptions to this rule; but few, we think, will be disposed to deny that it is the rule. On the supposition that the pupil at the outset is utterly ignorant of the art, we commence our instructions by elucidating.\\" There are principles underlying all drawing. According to Burn the first principle is: :As all drawings are reducible to certain lines and figures, we hold it necessary to enable the student to draw these elementary parts with the utmost facility; leading him by a series of examples from the drawing of a simple line, up to the most complicated sketch or object which may be offered to him; and then, by an advance to the more intricate rules, making plain the laws of vision (the foundation of perspective), so as to delineate correctly the various views in which they may be presented to his notice: the aim of the introductory lessons being to enable the student thoroughly to understand the reason why every operation is performed as directed, not merely to give him a facility for copying any determined object without reference to principles.Quote also cited in: Tom Richardson (2010) How to Draw People. p. 15 = Practical Geometry, 1853 = Practical Geometry, 1853, p. 1 The full title of this work is The Illustrated London Practical Geometry: And Its Application to Architectural Drawing ; for the Use of Schools and Students, published by Ingram, Cooke, and Company in 1853. In this work Burn goes on describing the basics of all drawing: :\\"Practical Geometry is the basis of all drawing. As the combination of lines and curves of the various letters form the foundation of written language, so the like combinations in geometrical construction form, we conceive, the foundation of the art of general drawing in all its branches. We do not insist so much on the fact, that the Unes and figures known as geometrical, are to be found more or less strongly indicated in all the varied and graceful forms scattered before us‚Äîfloating in the air‚Äîwaving in the trees‚Äîadding beauty to the rich landscape, or mirrored in our glassy ponds; but we would rather impress upon the mind of the reader the importance of the truth, that a knowledge of Geometry is essentially requisite before an acquaintance with accurate drawing is attainable.\\"Robert Scott Burn. The Illustrated London Practical Geometry. p. ii Looking back in his later work The illustrated architectural, engineering, & mechanical drawing-book Burn (1856) summarised, that the work in Practical Geometry gave \\"simple definitions and constructions of the various forms and figures which may be said to constitute the foundation of all drawing.\\" He further explained: :\\"We have there endeavoured to show that a knowledge of geometrical construction is necessary, before a thorough appreciation of the principles of outline sketching can be obtained, and a ready facility acquired in performing its operations. However much this position may be controverted as regards its application to an art which is generally looked upon as independent of, rather than dependent on, strict and formal rules, there can be no doubt, we think, that it holds with all completeness in reference to that which it is now our duty to illustrate and describe. In fact, so much do the various branches treated of in the following pages depend upon a knowledge of geometry, that many class them under the generic title of \\"geometrical drawing.\\" Those commencing the study of these arts ‚Äì so useful to the architect and the mechanic ‚Äì without this knowledge of geometry, will be disappointed as to their speedy proficiency, and will labour under great disadvantages, from not understanding the principles upon which the constructions are founded.\\" Robert Scott Burn. The illustrated architectural, engineering, & mechanical drawing- book. 2nd ed., rev. 1856, p. 5 = Mechanics and mechanism, 1853 = Mechanics and mechanism, title page, 1853 The 1853 Mechanics and Mechanism, is an illustrated educational work on mechanics and mechanism, published as part of the publishers Popular Educational Series. About the importance of this work, Burn explained in the preface of the first edition, citing himself from elsewhere: :\\"Mechanicians‚Äîand mechanism, the emanations of their genius ‚Äî occupy an important position in our social and commercial system. It is now scarcely, if at all, an exaggeration to affirm that, to the improvements recently effected in the various branches of the mechanical arts we owe our present position as a nation. The steam-engine, and the powers it gave us, enabled us to cope successfully with the otherwise overwhelming disadvantages which a long and expensive war entailed upon us. To mechanism we owe the factories from which we send out our cloths to supply the world's markets; to mechanism we owe that giant power which, with equal facility, propels our ships in the ocean storm, as in the calm waters of our inland rivers. It is mechanism, well arranged and modified, which whirls the traveller along the iron way with an untiring speed which the swiftest race-horse bred by man can never rival; it is mechanism, finely constituted and cunningly devised, which forms the plainly useful as well as the beautifully elegant of our numerous and varied fabrics; in fact and in short, there is scarcely an article we use but what owes its production to one of the many combinations of mechanism. Nothing to the accomplished mechanician comes amiss; constructing the simple mechanism which effects a single purpose with ease, he as freely masters that which is imitative of operations which, apparently, nothing less than human skill could execute or human brains dictate. No matter what the operation to be effected : let it be complex in its details, to a degree stultifying to an ordinary mind, no sooner is it required than machinery is devised and set to work; and the operation is effected apparently with as much ease as the forms are made which constitute written language by the pen of the ready writer, or the throwing of the shuttle in the weaver's hand-loom.\\"Robert Scott Burn. eds. Mechanics and mechanism, 3rd edition, 1958, p. vii‚Äìviii Within one year a second edition was published. A review of this second edition of in the newspaper Derby Mercury stated: > One of the best-considered and most judiciously-illustrated elementary > treatises on mechanics and mechanism which we have met with. The > illustrations, diagrams, and explanations are skilfully introduced, and > happily apposite; numerous, and beautifully executed. As a hand-book for the > instruction of youth, it would be difficult to surpass it.Advertisement in: > Jabez Hogg The Microscope: Its History, Construction, and Applications, > 1854, p. 444  Legacy  In the early 19th century, Burn was remembered as \\"author of a large number of technical handbooks, some of which maintained a steady sale during the last thirty-five years. The subjects dealt with included mechanics and mechanism, the steam-engine, building construction, and various branches of agriculture. He also wrote several works of a religious character, some of which were issued through the Religious Tract Society.\\" According to Mervyn Romans (2005), Robert Scott Burn and William S. Binns are considered the two most popular and influential writers of technical manuals in the Victorian Age. Especially Burn's The illustrated London drawing book and Mechanics and mechanism stayed in print for over 40 years. In the late 19th century according to Romans (2005) the \\"increased demand for technical manuals reflects a fundamental shift in the way instruction in drawing was already moving away from being strictly the preserve of artists, towards a wider role in scientific and vocational education as well.\\"  Selected publications  = 1850s = * Robert Scott Burn.

The phase of the mixture can be gaseous or liquid. The method is based on laser ignition devices that produce short but powerful flashes regardless of the pressure in the combustion chamber. Usually, high voltage spark plugs are good enough for automotive use, as the typical compression ratio of an otto cycle internal combustion engine is around 10:1 and in some rare cases reach 14:1. However, fuels such as natural gas or methanol can withstand high compression without self ignition. This allows higher compression ratios, because it is economically reasonable, as the fuel efficiency of such engines is high. Using high compression ratio and high pressure requires special spark plugs that are expensive and their electrodes still wear out. Thus, even expensive laser ignition systems could be economical, because they would last longer.  Further applications of laser ignition  Laser ignition is considered as a potential ignition system for non-hypergolic liquid rocket engines and reaction control systems which need an ignition system. Conventional ignition technologies like torch igniters are more complex in sequencing and need additional components like propellant feed lines and valves. Therefore, they are heavy compared to a laser ignition system. Pyrotechnical devices allow only one ignition per unit and imply increased launch pad precautions as they are made of explosives.

Seen as a symbol of the balsero exodus, Mart√≠nez first became known on August 21, 1994, as a 12-year-old rafter from Cuba. This was when the U.S. Coast Guard picked her and her family out of her raft. The Coast Guard wanted to take her violin because they thought the case might contain a weapon. She then opened the case and started to play The Star Spangled Banner on her violin. She spent five months at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base before being relocated to Miami. Mart√≠nez attended Florida International University and received a Bachelor of Science degree in music education. At her graduation at Florida International University she played the anthem in front of her fellow graduates to kick off the university's commencement ceremony. Mart√≠nez later played on her violin in front of United States Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Mart√≠nez also performed alongside Gloria Estefan and Jon Secada. She later became a teacher at Emerson Elementary, before teaching at M.A. Milam K-8 Center. She taught music, until budget cuts took away Milam's music program, leading her to teach English. Mart√≠nez is also married and has two children. Mart√≠nez was also featured in the film Voices from Cuba.

She is currently the National Press Secretary of the Human Rights Campaign. After winning the September 15, 2020 Democratic primary in the safely Democratic 1st Delaware State Senate district, she is \\"widely expected\\" to win in the the November 2020 election. If she does, she will become the first transgender state senator in the country as well as the highest-ranking transgender official in the country. McBride is largely credited with the passage of legislation in Delaware banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity in employment, housing, insurance, and public accommodations. In July 2016, she was a speaker at the Democratic National Convention, becoming the first openly transgender person to address a major party convention in American history. In 2018, McBride released the book Tomorrow Will Be Different: Love, Loss, and the Fight for Trans Equality. Career = Early life and education = Sarah McBride was born in Wilmington, Delaware, to David and Sally McBride. Prior to coming out, McBride was a campaign staffer in Delaware, working on several campaigns including Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden's 2010 campaign and Governor Jack Markell's 2008 campaign. In 2011, McBride was elected student body president at American University. During her last week as student body president, McBride gained international attention when she came out as a transgender woman in her college's student newspaper, The Eagle. McBride's coming out was featured on NPR, The Huffington Post, and by Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation. After coming out, McBride received a call from Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, saying, \\"Sarah, I just wanted you to know, I'm so proud of you. I love you, and you're still a part of the Biden family.\\" Vice President Joe Biden expressed similar sentiments, sharing that he was proud of her and happy for her. In 2012, McBride interned at The White House, becoming the first openly transgender woman to work there in any capacity. McBride worked in the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, where she worked on LGBT issues. In a speech in May 2015, Second Lady Jill Biden told Sarah's story. She added, \\"we believe young people should be valued for who they are, no matter what they look like, where they're from, the gender with which they identify, or who they love.\\" =Activism= In January 2013, McBride joined the board of directors of Equality Delaware and quickly became the state's leading advocate for legal protections and hate crimes legislation for transgender Delawareans. McBride and her family led the lobbying effort for legislation protecting Delawareans from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression in employment, housing, insurance, and public accommodations. In addition to serving as the primary spokesperson for the legislation, McBride's close relationship with Governor Jack Markell and Attorney General Beau Biden was credited with getting both elected officials vocally behind the bill. The legislation passed the state senate by a margin of one vote and the state house by a vote of 24-17. The amended bill was then re-passed by the state senate and immediately signed into law by Governor Jack Markell in June 2013. Upon signing the legislation, Markell stated, \\"I especially want to thank my friend Sarah McBride, an intelligent and talented Delawarean who happens to be transgender. She courageously stood before the General Assembly to describe her personal struggles with gender identity and communicate her desire to return home after her college graduation without fear. Her tireless advocacy for passage of this legislation has made a real difference for all transgender people in Delaware.\\" After the passage of Delaware's gender identity protections and hate crimes legislation, McBride worked on the LGBT Progress team at the Center for American Progress. McBride has spoken at a number of colleges and LGBT events, including the Human Rights Campaign National Dinner, the Human Rights Campaign Los Angeles Dinner, the Victory Fund National Brunch, the University of Pennsylvania, and Gettysburg College. McBride was ranked the Most Valuable Progressive in Delaware by DelawareLiberal.net listed in the 2014 list of the Trans 100, and named one of the fifty upcoming millennials poised to make a difference in the coming years by MIC.com. A 2015 article in the NewStatesman on transgender representation in elective office predicted McBride would be the first transgender American elected to high public office. McBride was a panelist at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's \\"GLOBE Pride 2016\\" on youth and workplace bullying. McBride has been featured in The New York Times, The Huffington Post, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, Al Jazeera, PBS NewsHour, Teen Vogue, North Carolina Public Radio, The New Yorker, MSNBC, ThinkProgress, Buzzfeed, and NPR. In April 2016, McBride delivered a TED Talk titled, \\"Gender assigned to us at birth should not dictate who we are.\\" She also served on the steering committee of Trans United for Hillary, an effort to educate and mobilize transgender people and their allies in support of Hillary Clinton. On July 28, 2016, McBride became the first openly transgender person to speak at a national party convention when she spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In her speech, which lasted less than four minutes, McBride paid tribute to her late husband Andrew Cray and his commitment to LGBT rights. McBride serves as the National Press Secretary of the Human Rights Campaign. Politics On July 9, 2019, McBride formally announced her candidacy for the Delaware Senate.Avery, Daniel (July 9, 2019). \\"Who Is Sarah McBride? Transgender Activist Announces Run for Delaware Senate.\\" Newsweek. Retrieved July 9, 2019. Sarah stated that her focus will be health care and paid family and medical leave. If successful, she would be the first transgender state senator in United States history. She would replace Democrat Harris McDowell III, who plans to retire at the end of his term. Personal life In August 2014, McBride married Andrew Cray after he received a terminal cancer diagnosis. Episcopal Bishop Gene Robinson presided at their ceremony.

Hazing  Hazing is the practice of rituals and other activities involving harassment, abuse or humiliation as a way of initiating a person into a group. Hazing is seen in many different types of social groups, including gangs, sports teams, schools, military units, fraternities and sororities. Hazing is often prohibited by law and may comprise either physical or psychological abuse. It may also include nudity or sexually-oriented offenses. More than half of hazing incidents on college campuses result in pictures publicly posted on the Internet.

This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of parental/authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyberbullying includes, but is not limited to, abuse using email, instant messaging, text messaging, websites, social networking sites, etc.Jose Bolton; Stan Graeve (2005). No Room for Bullies: From the Classroom to Cyberspace. Boys Town Press.. Retrieved 2013-10-29. In a study performed at Indiana State University, it was determined that electronic media such as social networking and text messaging are more common outlets for cyberbullying, while chat rooms and other websites are less likely to be used in cyberbullying. Once a young adult enters college, there is little to no computer monitoring, leading to the misuse of technology and the added probability of cyberbullying. There have been occasions where the bullying was not intentional, but still occurred. Even if the bullying was not consciously intended it can still have awful impacts. One study concluded that people had been ostracised online as a way of protecting another group of people. One woman had been listed as a political opponent on a pro-trans website due to misunderstandings and alternating views, which resulted in targeted messages and harassment. The listed person in question did not actually have any reservations against the trans community, and so they ended up being the bullied person. While the motivations of the authors of the website are unknown, it can be assumed that they did not specifically aim to target the person effected and thus the bullying was an inconsiderate result.  Techniques  According to an article in the Chronicle of High Education, academic bullies have initiated a variety of covert behaviors used to target their victims. These subtle actions include interruptions during group meetings, eye-rolling, undermining credibility, and exclusion from social interactions. Because of these techniques, bullying in academia is considered to be of a lower intensity.11\\\\. \\"The Clute InstituteContemporary Issues In Education Research.\\" Bullying in Academe: Prevalent, Significant, And Incessant. N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Jan. 2014.  Reasons  NoBullying.com lists a variety of reasons that bullying in college occurs. The first reason is that there are new targets available to the bully‚Äôs disclosure. The bully has said goodbye to the people he or she previously socialized with and/or bullied, so there is a need to satisfy such behaviors. Another reason is there is less direct authority. Leaving for college introduces many students to their first time on their own without the interference of parents and guardians. Faculty and staff are less interested in interpersonal relationships between their students and thus pay less attention to classroom dynamics as opposed to the attention a high school teacher might provide.12\\\\. \\"NOBullying.com.\\" No BullyingExpert Advice On Cyber Bullying School Bullying. N.p., n.d. Web. 09 Feb. 2014. College faculty and staff follow research that encourages them to take a backseat to bullying and allow the students to overcome adversity on their own. Students at most universities and colleges are not afforded the luxury of leaving after the school day as they would in highschool. Most have to spend time outside of school with their classmates whether they choose to or not. In college, a majority of the campuses are residential and thus students may see much more of their potential bullies and/or victims. Roommate conflicts inside the residential dorms can lead to active bullying. In fall 2012, a Rutgers University student committed suicide after his roommate had been filming him and his boyfriend engaging in sexual activities and posted the video online for all to see. The roommate said he did not want him dead, but wanted his friends to know he was disgusted by his behavior.  Locations  Lynne McDougall uncovered, in her study of bullying in higher education, that the majority of the locations where bullying occurs in colleges were quite conventional. A majority of the bullying is reported as occurring in the same corridor or department, thus suggesting that students within the same groups, divisions or under the same faculty are responsible for the bullying of their peers.13\\\\. McDougall, Lynne,. \\"A Study of Bullying in Further Education.\\" Pastoral Care (1999): 31-37. Web. 10 Feb. 2014. Entrance ways of buildings are another prime location for bullying to occur. Entrances and exit ways are common areas where students have the opportunity to smoke and socialize in between their classes. The library was deemed an area of bullying in McDougall‚Äôs study as well, hinting that bullying occurs in places where little to no supervision or control is present. The advancement of technology in the classroom has allowed for cyberbullying to occur while students are gathered for the intent of education. Social media websites such as Twitter, allow students to actively post content bashing their classmates. College-specific accounts have been created where members of the student body can send posts and messages to an administrator who then retweets or posts the content for all the account‚Äôs followers to read.  Legality  Colleges are not mandated to produce strategies or policies regarding anti-bullying, however some have codes of conduct that encourage students to exhibit appropriate behavior at all times. In most codes of conduct the word bullying is never cited in the physical text. ‚ÄúBoth the perpetrators and the victims are adults, so the legal framework is very, very different,‚Äù said Charlie Rose, the U.S. Department of Education‚Äôs general counsel.14\\\\. \\"Prevention Update: Bullying and Cyberbullying at Colleges and Universities.\\" The Higher Education Center for Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Violence Prevention, n.d.

Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that interferes with a student‚Äôs ability to learn, work, achieve or participate in activities. This can include unwanted sexual advances, sexual touching, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal, nonverbal and physical actions of a sexual nature. This includes spreading sexual rumors, making sexual comments, jokes, gestures, vandalism, pictures, written materials, rating students sexually and circulating Web content of a sexual nature.15\\\\. \\"Michigan State University MSU Extension.\\" Bullying Issues Continue into the College Years for Some Students.

It is manufactured at the main plant in Pembina, North Dakota, United States. The 102DL3 was the original designation, used from 1992 through 2001, when the name was changed to D4500. It was the first successful 45 foot coach in service and is among the most popular intercity coaches in North America. The coach uses MCI's special platform integral construction, which has come to dominate the US and Canada markets, allowing high durability and easy maintenance. It has a much longer service life than body-on-chassis coaches. All 102DL3 and D4500 coaches are available with full- painted sides or stainless steel lower body. Development The MCI 102DL3 was developed from a 1988 Canadian government request to develop a wheelchair- accessible intercity bus. The prototype was apparently developed from the MCI 102C3 with a 102B3 nose and extended to . A large wheelchair-accessible lavatory was installed in the rear. The prototype was completed in 1990, but couldn't enter service in the US because it was too long, until the 45-foot length was approved in 1991. Changes were made for the production model. The engine was upgraded to the large new Detroit Diesel Series 60 and received a bigger rear end with powerful radiator and intercooler. The large lavatory and wheelchair lift was removed from the production model, but could still be fitted by request. In the future a lift would be required for ADA regulations. The production model was named 102DL3 and entered production in October 1992, followed by introduction into service in 1993. Early buyers included Peter Pan Lines, Fullington Trailways, and Horizon Coach Lines. The coach was immediately known for its surprisingly high speed, large size, and the durability of its integral construction. At the time, Greyhound Canada owned MCI, so they tested the model in 1992, but didn't order any until 1995. Variants =MCI 102DL3= The original version was the 102DL3, entering production in 1992 and entering service by early 1993. The 102DL3 has large, block fender skirts, a rear-mounted radiator fan side-by-side with the intercooler fan, and air intake covered by a large grille, two piece engine door, small headlight/taillights, and a black roof cap. The seating capacity was 54 or 55 passengers, or 57-61 with the high-density configuration. The 102DL3 was renamed D4500 in 2001. =MCI D4500= The D4500 was exactly the same coach as the 102DL3, having been renamed in 2001 to promote a new, simplified designation system. It was replaced by the D4500CL and D4500CT in 2005. A 2002 D4500, #2905, operating for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority =MCI D4500CL= The D4500CL is a less-modified version of the D4500CT, compared to the D4500. It has a modified roof (with no visible rivets) and optional frameless passenger windows. In 2008, the D4500CL received a higher passenger deck for increased luggage capacity. MCI stopped selling the D4500CL in 2008. =MCI D4500CT= DART First State MCI D4500CT bus 914 The D4500CT was a modernized \\"contemporary\\" version of the D4500. It received enlarged headlights similar to those on MCI's G-series buses, a revised roof (with no visible rivets), and optional rimless passenger windows. In 2008, the D4500CT received a higher passenger deck for increased luggage capacity. The D4500CT CNG is the CNG-powered variant, it uses a Cummins- Westport ISX12N. It formerly used a Cummins-Westport ISL G or ISX12 G Headlight Redesign Likely as a request from New Jersey Transit, their 2014 batch of D4500CT CNG coaches were delivered with redesigned headlights. This simplified design has three round LED clusters arranged in a gently curving row. =MCI D4500CTH= A Coach USA/ShortLine D4500CTH in Midtown Manhattan. The D4500CTH was a hybrid version of the D4500CT. It uses a Cummins ISL9 or L9 engine, with an Allison EP50 hybrid system. It was introduced in 2008. =Commuter Coach= The commuter coach version of the 102DL3/D4500 has a large electronic destination sign replacing the black roof cap and lavatory removed for a seating capacity of 57 passengers. A capacity of 61 passengers can be achieved with \\"slim line\\" seating. All commuter coach models have bi- leaf plug doors, instead of the regular sedan or single-leaf plug doors.

The tetrad ended with the lunar eclipse on September 27‚Äì28, 2015. Overview On April 15, 2014, there was a total lunar eclipse which was the first of four consecutive total eclipses in a series, known as a tetrad; the second one took place on October 8, 2014, the third on April 4, 2015, and the fourth on September 28, 2015. It is the second of eight tetrads to take place during the 21st century AD. As with most lunar eclipses, the moon appeared red during the April 15, 2014, eclipse. The red color is caused by Rayleigh scattering of sunlight through the Earth's atmosphere, the same effect that causes sunsets to appear red.

The blood moon also is prophesied in the Book of Revelation chapter 6 verses 11‚Äì13, where verse 12 states, \\"And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.\\" Hagee later wrote Four Blood Moons, that became a best- seller, being more than 150 days in Amazon.com's top 150 by April 2014. For the week ending March 30, 2014, it was the ninth best selling paperback, according to Publishers Weekly. By mid-April, Hagee's book was No. 4 on The New York Times best-seller list in the advice category. Hagee's book (and subsequent preaching series at his home congregation, Cornerstone Church) did not claim that any specific \\"end times\\" event would occur but claimed that every prior tetrad of the last 500 years coincided with events in Jewish and Israeli history that were originally tragic, yet followed by triumph. Media attention Hagee and Biltz's claims gained mainstream media attention in publications such as USA Today and The Washington Post. Earth & Sky reported receiving \\"a number of inquiries about Blood Moon\\". Writing for Earth & Sky Bruce McClure and Deborah Byrd point out that the referenced verse also says the \\"sun will be turned into darkness\\", an apparent reference to a solar eclipse. They note that since the Jewish Calendar is lunar, one-sixth of all eclipses will occur during Passover or Sukkot. Furthermore, there have been 62 tetrads since the 1st century AD, though only eight of them have coincided with both feasts. Additionally, three of the four eclipses in the tetrad were not even visible in the biblical homeland of Israel, casting further doubt on Hagee and Biltz's interpretation; even then, only the very end of the last eclipse was visible in Israel.

It is spread across a land measuring and was established during the British rule. The hospital has specialized in 15 basic disciplines and super- specialized in 3 disciplines. The National Board of Examination (NBE) has accredited the hospital for recognition in postgraduate training. The hospital has also been accredited by international institutions such as Royal College of Surgeons for imparting training in PG courses. It is also an approved institution for training nurses. The hospital was established chiefly to serve the employees of the Indian Railways. The hospital, however, caters to general public as well at a low cost. The hospital is a national referral centre for cardiology and cardiovascular surgery for the Indian Railways. Southern Railway is constructing a new hospital to shift the current one and is planning to establish a medical college with private participation at the existing hospital premises. Location The hospital is located on Constable Road, at Chinna Chembarambakkam, Ayanavaram. It is located between Perambur Carriage Works and Perambur Loco Works railway stations. History The hospital was established in the British era. The need to build a separate hospital for the needs of the railway employees was felt in 1925 by the then chief medical officer of the Madras and Southern Mahratta (MSM) Railway, Maj. G. J. Cruikshank. In 1928, a 40-bed hospital was established for the MSM Railway employees in Perambur with a senior surgeon, 4 assistants and 12 nurses. In its initial days, the hospital primarily served the needs of the residents of the railway colony and the employees of the railway workshops. By 1930, the bed count of the hospital was increased to 50 besides additional facilities such as an operation theatre, x-ray centre, laboratory and out- patient services department. By 1957, the number of beds was increased to 120. In 1958, an x-ray block was established. In 1959, a maternity ward with 12 beds was added. In 1960, a TB annexe with 220 beds was created, and subsequently, a cardiology centre was opened. By 1973, an ICU was started and soon many out-patient clinics such as eye, dental and ENT were also introduced. By the 1970s, the hospital became an all-India referral centre for cardiovascular diseases. The term cardiac anaesthesia as a sub-speciality of anaesthesia was coined in this hospital in 1977 by physician Kalyan Singh. Soon, the Department of Cardiac Surgery at the hospital was recognised as one of the best cardiac surgery units in the country, especially for complex congenital open heart surgeries in neonates and infants. Along the lines of the Perambur hospital, which focussed on cardiac care, several railway hospitals were developed across the country, namely, Howrah as a centre for orthopaedics, Mumbai for plastic surgery, and Varanasi for oncology. By 1978, twin operation theatres with 20 beds with post-operation wards for cardiac patients were established. By then, all speciality departments in the hospital became functional and the bed strength was increased to 505. In January 1980, the first modern Cardiac Cath Lab was opened at the hospital. In 1984, the hospital was recognised by the National Board of Exams for Postgraduate Training, when the Y. N. Mehrothra was the chief medical officer. In 1988, Its first candidate, J. S. N. Murthy, brought the Higher Education Link Scheme (HELS), a three-year academic programme, between Southern Railway Hospital and London University, with the support of Prof. Glennis Haworth, S. N. Kumar and Kartar Singh of the British Council, P. Srinivasan of the Jeevan Blood Bank, and the railway administration. By 1990, a new Cath Lab was established along with facilities such as DSA, laser surgical unit, and video endoscopy. Two more new Cath Labs were since added. On 7 March 2014, another cardiac catheterization laboratory, established at a cost of 38.8 million, was inaugurated at the cardiac unit of the hospital. The unit was inaugurated by the Director General of Railway Health Services, PS Prasad. In 2006, the Southern Railway announced establishing a new nine-storied complex to be constructed at a cost of 500 million, with a 15-million computer-based navigation orthopaedic surgery equipment, to replace the existing hospital. In 2009, Southern Railway announced its plans to establish a medical college at the existing premises. The hospital today As of 2014, on an average, around 1,400 out-patients visit the existing railway hospital. Across the country's 16 railway zones, the new hospital at Perambur is said to be the largest railway hospital in terms of in-patients capacity and the facilities available. Railway hospitals in Mumbai and Kolkata are ranked second and third, respectively, in terms of in-patients capacity. As of 2014, the hospital performed around 2,500 cath lab procedures and around 1,000 cardiac surgery procedures a year. About one in four of the cath lab procedures are interventional therapeutic procedures ranging from paediatric interventions to complex valve, coronary and peripheral vascular interventions. New hospital A new railway multi-speciality hospital is being constructed at Perambur at a cost of 1,900 million. Formed part of the railway budget announcement in 2006‚Äì07, the actual work began in November 2007 under Railway Works. The hospital is being built in a campus measuring a little over and will have a separate out-patient department block and 6 in-patient blocks. These will be constructed in phases. The hospital will have 600 beds, 45 consulting rooms and 14 operation theatres (including 10 general and 4 dedicated operation theatres). The hospital will have 8 floors and a total built-up area of 576,000 sq ft. The hospital is expected to be ready by March 2016. The out-patients block has two floors while the in-patients block has five floors with each floor measuring 6,000 sq ft. The new hospital would also have specialists in cardiology, orthopaedics, gynaecology, general medicine, paediatrics and cardio-thoracic.

Saboeut was one of five siblings born to her parents, Ros Bun and Nath Samean. Her younger sister was singer Ros Serey Sothea. In the 1960s, Cambodian Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, a musician himself, encouraged the development of popular music in Cambodia. This inspired a flourishing rock music scene based in Phnom Penh, in which Sabouet's sister Sothea achieved great fame and influence. This music scene was abruptly crushed by the Khmer Rouge communists in 1975. Saboeut survived the ensuing Cambodian genocide, but her sister Sothea disappeared and is presumed dead, as is the case with many of Sothea's contemporaries in Cambodian popular music. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, many musicians contacted Saboeut to inquire about her sister Sothea's fate. Maintaining a list of contacts, Saboeut took the opportunity to reunite Cambodia's surviving rock musicians. Her efforts are widely credited with reviving Cambodian music in the aftermath of the genocide. According to Youk Chhang, the executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, Saboeut sought to restore Cambodian music as a tribute to her sister, saying \\"I think she was bound by the legacy of her sister to help.\\" Shortly before her death, Saboeut was interviewed extensively for the 2015 documentary film on the history of Cambodian rock music, Don't Think I've Forgotten, in which her sister Sothea is profiled in detail.

Built by 1799 by one of the town's early settlers, the building (now a private residence) is one of the town's finest surviving examples of transitional Georgian-Federal architecture. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Jeremiah Hutchins Tavern stands near the northern end of Bath's Upper Village, a cluster of residential and agricultural buildings about north of the village center. It is located close to the west side of United States Route 302, opposite Hutchins Lane. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. A two-story gabled ell extends to the rear, flush with the main block's southern facade. The main facade, facing the street, is five bays wide, with windows arranged symmetrically around the center entrance. The entrance is set in a recess with paneled sides, and sidelight and transom windows. It originally had an entrance on the north side, but it has been closed up and a bathroom placed in its stead. Much of the original interior finish work has been preserved. The building, now a private residence, was built sometime between 1794, when Jeremiah Hutchins was granted a license by the town to operate a tavern, and 1799, when it was reported to open. It is the best-preserved transitional Georgian-Federal building in the town. Hutchins was one of Bath's early settlers, and he and his descendants were leading citizens of the town. The Hutchinses were responsible for building most of the historic buildings in the upper village, and William, a grandson of Jeremiah, is credited with construction of the Brick Store in Bath village.

Her areas of research included the agricultural history of the Northern Great Plains, dry land agriculture and land utilization. She was a Brookings Institution scholar, editor of the Henry Clay Papers and served in leadership roles in the Organization of American Historians, the Southern Historical Association; in 1975 was elected president of the Agricultural History Society. She also served as a local and state officer in the American Association of University Women. Early life and academic background Born on March 1, 1914, in Erie, Pennsylvania, Mary Wilma Massey was an only child. She attended East High School, and she enjoyed swimming as well as track and field sports. An excellent student she won a full scholarship to Bucknell University and graduated in 1935 with a triple major in history, English and the social studies. She earned her master's degree in history from Radcliffe College/Harvard University in 1936, and she served as a research editor at the Harvard University School of Business Administration. She began her work on the Ph.D. as a doctoral candidate at Radcliffe writing about settlement in the American West, working under an exponent of the thesis of Frederick Jackson Turner - mentored by Harvard historian Frederick Merk. While at Harvard in 1939, she became a junior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C. Marriage and a career on hold At Brookings, she met Herbert Walter \\"Walt\\" Hargreaves, who was finishing up his Ph.D. in economics from Duke University. They married on August 24, 1940, and she followed her husband when he was hired to teach at what is now the University of Texas at El Paso. Walt Hargreaves joined up during World War II, and they moved to various posts for his training. He served also as a member of the economic reconstruction delegation to Germany, and for most of the war she lived in Brooklyn, New York. Soon after the war, Walt Hargreaves was hired as a professor of economics at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. When they arrived in Kentucky, Mary Wilma Hargreaves met Thomas D. Clark in the History Department who invited her to guest lecture in his classes on American land policy, the subject of her dissertation. Finally, in 1951, Mary Wilma Hargreaves earned her Ph.D. in history from Harvard University. She applied for a job in the University's History Department, but instead was hired as a typist for James F. Hopkins who had been working on gathering the letters and works of Henry Clay for a bound series. By 1957 with a grant from the Eli Lilly Endowment and sponsored as part of a program by the National Archives and Records Division, Hopkins was appointed editor-in-chief of the Henry Clay Papers and Hargreaves was hired as associate editor. Together they edited the first five volumes of the series. Career as historian Hargreaves was finally hired as a professor in the University of Kentucky History Department in 1964 to teach courses on the American frontier and economic history of the U.S. She remained associate editor of the Henry Clay Papers until 1974 when she then became co-editor and project director. She was promoted to full professor in 1973 - the first woman in the department's history to do so. She wrote three major works, two of which focused on the economic history of the agricultural practices used in the high plains, with interpretations on the formation of national land policy and the socioeconomic problems associated with that. Her book Dry Farming the Northern Great Plains, 1900-1925 (Harvard, 1957) was a part of the prestigious Harvard Economic Studies series (Volume 101) and went through nine editions. By the 1970s she was writing important groundbreaking articles to update and expand upon her original work on the history of the American west, broadening her analysis to include studies of women's critical roles in agriculture and the settlement of the Great Plains. She followed in Thomas D. Clark's footsteps when she won the Theodore Hallam Professor Award of the UK History Department for outstanding achievement. She served on many boards, including the Henry Clay Memorial Foundation which acquired Ashland, the estate of Henry Clay. Retired life and death Hargreaves retired from the University of Kentucky in 1984 and was named professor emerita. She continued to work as a scholar and community activist, living with her husband in Lexington on Cassidy Avenue. During her retirement she produced a volume for the University Press of Kansas' American Presidency series: The Presidency of John Quincy Adams (Lawrence, Kansas, 1985). Her book Dry Farming in the Northern Great Plains: Years of Readjustment, 1920-1990 (Lawrence, Kansas, 1993) followed up on the topic of her first study and was awarded the Theodore Saloutos book prize by the Agricultural History Society. It is still widely regarded as a standard work on that topic. She was an active member of the First United Methodist Church in Lexington and left a legacy for the Kentucky United Methodist Homes for Children and Youth. Her activism in organizations included animal rights. She especially loved her many golden retrievers. She and her husband enjoyed classical music as well as ballroom dancing at Arthur Murray studios. After a brief illness, Hargreaves died on August 29, 2008, in Lexington, Kentucky at age 94. Besides the First United Methodist legacy, Hargreaves also upon her death endowed a general fund scholarship at the University of Nevada, Reno. A University of Kentucky Graduate School fellowship was named in her memory to provide financial support for graduate student travel, both for dissertation related research and for presentations at scholarly conferences.

The Highland Clearances, crop failures, and population pressures in industrialised urban centres all created conditions that, by the mid- nineteenth century, made emigration seem attractive to many poorer Scots. John McGlashan was the association's secretary in Edinburgh, Scotland, from 1847. He would himself emigrate in 1853.

Description and history The Edward H. Lane House is located just outside Littleton's commercial downtown area, on the east side of Cottage Street (U.S. Route 302) just south of the Ammonoosuc River. It is a somewhat typical connected New England farmstead, with a main house joined to a barn by a number of additions. The oldest portion of the farmstead is a story wood frame Cape- style structure built c. 1830-50 in the Greek Revival period. It is now an ell to the larger Queen Anne main house, a more elaborately decorated story wood frame structure with turret and decorated gables. The older portion is joined to a late 19th century barn by a third addition. The building reflects Littleton's growing prosperity during the 19th century. The oldest portion is a relatively modest structure suitable for what was at the time a primarily agrarian community. When Littleton's industries boomed in the late 19th century, the prosperity made possible the construction of the much larger and more elaborate front section, with its finely detailed cornices and porches.

Salal berries were traditionally picked in late summer and eaten fresh or dried into cakes for winter There are numerous wild edible and medicinal plants in British Columbia that are used traditionally by First Nations peoples. These include seaweeds, rhizomes and shoots of flowering plants, berries, and fungi.  History  Almost all major groups of wild plants in British Columbia have edible members that are reported to have been used by the First Nations peoples. Many are still used today. Native plants of B.C. largely contributed to the diets of First Nations peoples of this area before these people and their land were colonized.  Seaweed  Seaweed has been an important plant for many First Nations peoples of British Columbia. Along the coast, families still travel out to seaweed beds that have provided food for thousands of years. Dried red laver (Porphyra abbottiae Krishnamurthy) is a type of edible seaweed. Laver is usually gathered in great amounts in Spring. They were used traditionally by virtually all the coastal groups, with the possible exception of some Nuu-chah-nulth, or Westcoast peoples, and some Salishan peoples of Vancouver Island, and various species were used. They are harvested at their young growing stage in the spring, usually around May, the exact time depending on latitude, local conditions, and type of laver. Older plants were too tough to be eaten. Traditionally, women were seaweed harvesters. Working from canoes, women would pull seaweed from the rocks until their canoes were full. At the beach it would be piled up, covered with mats and then finally dried on cedarwood frames, where is would hang to dry for 2‚Äì3 days. Sometimes it would be hung out for only one day, and then moved to the smokehouse for the remaining time. Lightly smoked, it was found to take on a unique flavor. The Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakwala speaking villages), for example, traditionally prepared cakes of red laver by covering the harvested seaweed and allowing it to decompose for 4‚Äì5 days, then pressing it into wood frames and drying it in the sun. The resulting cakes were then placed in cedar-wood boxes in layers alternating with layers of chiton juice (obtained by chewing the chiton and spitting out the saliva) and young boughs of red-cedar (Thuja plicata). When the box was filled, it was weighted with several large rocks, tied down with rope, and left for about a month. Then the entire process was repeated, altogether four times. Finally, the cakes were packed in a box without cedar boughs and stored for winter, when they were eaten with smoked salmon at tribal feasts. At this time, they were torn into strips, chopped with adzes, chewed, and put into a large dish. Water was poured overtop, and the seaweed was stirred and allowed to boil for a long time. Then eulachon oil was added and the mixture was served in small dishes and eaten with spoons by the guests. The Haida used a similar method, leaving piles of the harvested seaweed to ferment for a few days before drying it. Dried seaweed cakes were chopped or shredded into pieces, then boiled or used in soups and stews. Kwakwaka'wakw people sometimes dried and toasted individual sheets of the seaweed on a rack over the fire, then powdered it and boiled it with water. The simplest method of curing the seaweed, most commonly used at present, is to spread it out on rocks in the sun. When dry, it is broken into small pieces and stored. It is then eaten dry, as a snack, or cooked in a variety of dishes. It is commonly mixed or cooked with eulachon oil, halibut heads, clams, fat of deer, bear or seal, or with salmon or salmon eggs. One contemporary innovation is creamed corn with seaweed. Dried seaweed is a common trade item among various families and communities. Roots, sprouts, leaves, and rhizomes Berries and seaweeds are widely eaten by the First Nations peoples of British Columbia. Traditionally, root vegetables held a very high status in First Nations food systems. Root vegetables were important for food, ceremonial and economic reasons. Some nations held a First Roots ceremony to show respect for the roots before the community went digging for their needs. Roots were dried in large quantities, traded from one place to another and were kept as a \\"back-up\\" in times of food shortage. For example, during the summer months, St'at'imc, Nlaka'pamux and Secwepemc women would dig the corms of yellow glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum). Families would gather upwards of 2000 lbs. The corms were cleaned then steamed or pit-cooked. Large quantities of yellow glacier lily roots would be dried for later use or for trade. In addition, Camas used to be an important staple across Southern BC. Access to and the use of camas by Interior communities was made possible through trade from the peoples of what is now northern Washington. Large camas beds on southern Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands were kept free of invading plants through regular clearing and burning. Traditionally, for the Kwakwaka'wakw village of Haada, trade in root vegetables (springbank clover (Trifolium wormskioldii), silverweed and northern riceroot (Fritillaria camschatcensis) with the Nuxalk and Heiltsuk was an important part of their regional economy. Kinnikinnick,(bearberry) leaves and berries  Berries  For thousands of years, over 30 types of berries have been harvested in traditional territories of British Columbia from early summer (soapberries, salmonberries, thimbleberries), to late fall (cranberries, crabapples), depending on the berry type and location. Berries were an important part of traditional knowledge. First Nations peoples were shown when the berries were ripe by listening and observing the changes in the animals and plants. The wild rose blooming announced the readiness of sxusem (soapberries) for Nlaka'pamux. The song of Swainson's thrush heralded the ripening of salmonberries for Tlingit, Tsimshian, Haida, Haisla, Oweekeno, Squamish, Nuu- chah-nulth, Ditidaht, and Northern Straits Salish people. Soapberries hold a high place and have a lasting taste memory. Saponins in the soapberries allow them to be whipped up into a frothy 'ice cream' which was traditionally eaten in British Columbia. So-called 'Indian' ice cream has often been mixed in with dried meat, or may be served alone. Soapberries have been mixed with sugar and added to carbonated water as an alternative to pop. Berries contain vitamin C, fibre, and carbohydrates. = Traditionally harvested berries= North Coast: bunchberries, blueberries, cloudberries, cranberries, crowberries (mossberries), currant, gooseberry, blue elderberry, red huckleberry, salmonberry, thimbleberries (Rubus parviflorus), black hawthorn (jam/jelly), crabapple (jam/jelly), oregon grape (jam/jelly), soapberries, strawberry South Coast: cranberries, red huckleberries, salmonberries, thimbleberries, strawberry, oregon grape (jam/jelly), cherries, currants, blackberries, gooseberries, soapberries, strawberries Southern interior: blueberries, cranberries, currants, blue huckleberries/bilberry (Vaccinium deliciosum), blue elderberry, soapberries, black raspberry, strawberries Northern interior: blueberries, cranberries, blue huckleberries/bilberry, crowberries (mossberry), currants, bunchberries, cloudberries.  Fungi  Puffball mushroom releasing spores. In the Sechelt language, Shashishalhem (/ É√° É√≠ É√°…¨…ôm/), their name translates as \\"star-excrement\\". Among the Northwest Coast peoples, despite the availability of innumerable kinds of edible mushrooms, few were recognized with names, and with some minor exceptions, few were eaten. In some coastal languages, such as Haida, there does not appear to have been even a general name for \\"mushroom.\\" In the Nuxalk (Bella Coola) language, the name for mushrooms means \\"hats-on-the-ground\\". Sometimes 'puffballs' are associated with stars. In the Sechelt (Shishalh) language, Shashishalhem (/ É√° É√≠ É√°…¨…ôm/), for example, their name translates as \\"star- excrement\\". In other areas, such as Nlaka'pamux (Thompson) Interior Salish, puffballs are associated with ghosts and corpses. Puffballs and some tree fungi (polypores) were used medicinally by Interior Salish and other peoples. In addition, the Interior Salish did eat approximately six different types of mushrooms traditionally and some Chilcotin people were said to eat certain types. Considering the large variety and general abundance of different types of mushrooms and fleshy fungi available to First Nations peoples of British Columbia, it is somewhat surprising that so few were used traditionally as food. Possibly this is because it is difficult to distinguish toxic from non- toxic types. However, some First Nations peoples who did eat some mushroom species were certainly aware of, and had names for poisonous species as well. For example, the Nlaka'pamux Interior Salish recognized a whole class of \\"bad mushrooms,\\" including at least one type called \\"hole-in-the-top,\\" a Lactarius species (tentatively, L. resimus). It was said that if one ate this, (his) stomach would \\"swell up\\"; the only cure was to eat bear's grease. Studies of edible mushrooms in the Interior Salish area of British Columbia have resulted in the collection and verification by mycologists of four traditionally used species: Cottonwood mushroom (Tricholoma populinum), Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus; including P. sapidus), Pine mushroom (Tricholoma magnivelare) and Red Waxy Cap/Larch Waxy Cap (Hygrophorus speciosus). Other varieties eaten by B.C. First Nations peoples include: Chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius), Shelf Fungus (Ganoderma applanatum), Slippery-top (Hygrophorus gliocyclus), Morel (Morchella spp.) Jelly fungus (Tremella mesenterica) and St. George's mushroom (Tricholoma gambosum). = A list of 'safe' wild mushrooms of British Columbia include = * apricot jelly mushroom * bear's head tooth mushroom * black mole * blue chanterelle * cauliflower mushroom * chicken of the woods * comb tooth mushroom * common puffball * fairy ring mushroom * golden chanterelle (aka chanterelle) * hedgehog mushroom * hexagonal-pored polypore * horn of plenty (aka black chanterelle, black trumpet) * horse mushroom * ink cap * jelly ear (aka wood ear) * king bolete (aka cepe) * larch bolete * lion's mane * lobster mushroom * meadow mushroom * mica cap * oyster mushroom * red cracked bolete * rosy gomphidius * saffron milk cap * scaly hedgehog * shaggy mane * slimy spike cap * western giant puffball * yellow swamp russula * yellow-gilled russula Most common traditionally harvested plants by First Nations peoples in B.C.

Times article, 1989-09-30, Retrieved on 2014-04-06 Foreman was three years and 19 fights into his comeback. At that time of his fight with Cooney, Foreman had won all 19 of his comeback fights, scoring 18 knockouts and only one opponent, journeyman heavyweight Everett \\"Bigfoot\\" Martin had managed to go the distance with Foreman. However, Foreman's opponents had ranged from complete unknowns to career journeyman (including Martin, David Jaco and Bert Cooper) with few notable victories, with his most decorated opponent being former light heavyweight and cruiserweight world champion, as well as future hall-of-famer Dwight Muhammad Qawi, who was dwarfed by Foreman and had never fought in the heavyweight division prior to that fight. With Cooney, however, Foreman was taking on a former heavyweight title contender who held victories over former contenders and Foreman adversaries Ken Norton, Ron Lyle and Jimmy Young, whose victory over Foreman in 1977 sent him into a 10-year retirement. Cooney's most notable bout had been his 1982 IBF title fight against Larry Holmes. After three consecutive knockout victories over the aforementioned Young, Lyle and Norton, Cooney was regarded as the number one challenger to Holmes's heavyweight title and viewed as having a legit chance at ending Holmes' undefeated record and capturing the title. Cooney fought a close fight with Holmes, but he tired during the later rounds and his corner stopped the fight in the 13th round after a barrage of punches from Holmes. After the Holmes fight, Cooney had fought only sporadically, in the seven plus years between his fight with Holmes and Foreman, Cooney had only partaken in four fights and had completely sat out the entire years of 1983, 1985, 1988 and 1989. Before his fight with Foreman, Cooney's last fight had been against then-undefeated The Ring and lineal heavyweight champion Michael Spinks two and a half year earlier on June 15, 1987, a fight Cooney would lose by knockout in the fifth round. Despite criticism of both fighters advanced ages, with critics in the media dubbing the fight \\"The Geezers at Caesars\\",\\"Geezers at Caesars\\" Nothing but a Joke, Orlando Sentinel article, 1990-01-09, Retrieved on 2014-04-06 there was some considerable hype surrounding the fight and it was decided that the bout would air on pay-per-view.

Times article, 1989-09-19, Retrieved on 2014-04-06 The Fight The two men fought a close first round and traded jabs throughout. Towards the end of the first round, Cooney caught Foreman with a left hand that stunned Foreman, one of the few times during Foreman's comeback that he was hurt by an opponent. However, things would go downhill for Cooney in the second. Foreman would dominate the action in the second and sent Cooney down to the canvas after stunning him with a left uppercut and then landing several right hands followed by a straight left just past the midway mark. Cooney answered the referee's ten count and though clearly hurt from the exchange, was allowed to continue. Foreman then charged at the still staggering Cooney, delivered a sharp left uppercut that knocked Cooney out on his feet, followed by a quick right cross before the referee could step in, sending Cooney face- first to the canvas. As Cooney was clearly unresponsive, referee Joe Cortez didn't bother making the ten count and immediately stopped the fight and Foreman was named the winner by technical knockout at 1:57 of the round.Foreman Wins in 2d Round and Sends Cooney Into Retirement, N.Y.

It aired on Fox in the United States on March 30, 2014. Plot Bob and Linda sign up for a wine tasting on a train. The kids are forced to stay in the back car, a miserable kids' room called the \\"Juice Caboose\\" with their classmate, Regular Sized Rudy, who is there because his dad takes his online dates there every weekend. The train ride is four hours and the attendant, Ethan, only unlocks the door once an hour to give them juice boxes. Knowing there is a chocolate dipping fountain, the kids hatch a plan to steal the kitchen's chocolate. They distract Ethan so Louise can climb under the cart and be wheeled all the way to the kitchen car at the front of the train. They also tell Ethan that today is Linda's birthday so the entire staff will leave to present her with a birthday cheesecake. With the kitchen empty, Louise steals all the chocolate, puts it in a bag, and jumps off the slow-speed train to run alongside to the back car, where Rudy, Tina, and Gene will pull her in through the car's bathroom window. However, the plan goes astray when the chef forces his way into the bathroom and the kids are unable to meet up with Louise. Once he leaves, the kids try to pull Louise in, but all fall out of the window. They manage to climb back in, but Ethan is about to deliver the juice boxes and they have nowhere to hide the chocolate. Alerted to the disappearance of the chocolate, both Ethan and the chef search the car, but can find nothing; Louise had hidden the chocolate on top of the car's roof hatch. The sun's heat begins to melt the chocolate, causing it to slowly rain down on the kids just as Ethan and the chef leave. The kids enjoy their spoils by dancing in and eating the chocolate rain. Meanwhile, Bob and Linda are joined in their tasting by a pretentious \\"wine expert\\" named Rick, who belittles Bob and Linda's wine knowledge. At another table, Rudy's father has a rocky time with his date, who becomes less and less impressed with him as he reveals he is a single father and lied about his looks. Rick forces Bob into a blindfolded wine tasting competition. Easily beating Bob, Rick boasts that he can guess any wine and offers to let Bob win it all if he can accurately guess any wine Linda wants to pick. Bob is able to immediately identify it, but Rick cannot, stubbornly drinking several glasses before giving up. Bob announces that it is the wine from the spit bucket. Rick is revolted, and Linda gleefully states that she knew Bob would guess it, because he drank from one at another wine bar on a bet from Linda the previous night. Bob taunts Rick about how he drank spit, causing Rick to throw wine on him and start a \\"wine fight\\". Amidst the chaos, Rudy's father admits to his date that he has been having a difficult time getting back into the dating scene and she forgives him, splashing him with wine and giving him a kiss. At the end of the ride, the Belchers meet up, covered in chocolate and wine, as Ethan realizes that the kids had indeed stolen the chocolate and angrily shouts at them from the departing train. Reception Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying ‚ÄúThe Kids Rob a Train‚Äù lays out everything right there in the title. But it‚Äôs still a surprisingly tense episode, even though the children are never in any real danger. It reminds me of ‚ÄúFort Night,‚Äù the great Halloween episode with crazy Millie. The kids were never going to die that night, and they‚Äôre not going to get hurt trying to jump back onto the train. But Bob‚Äôs Burgers manages to create suspense in both episodes while still being very, very funny.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10, saying \\"Shame that the episode didn‚Äôt just stick with the adults as the whole train robbery bit with the kids wasn‚Äôt all that exciting. The three gang up with Regular-Sized Rudy who is stuck in the juice caboose while his dad is on a date to liberate the bars of chocolate from the front of the train. It‚Äôs a deeply silly idea and seemed, as ever, just an excuse for the kids to toss off as many weird asides as they could. Though a success in that regard, I probably laughed less at this episode than any of the 14 that preceded it.

It depicts elderly photographer Imogen Cunningham, encountering nude model Twinka Thiebaud behind a tree in Yosemite National Park. It is considered Dater's most popular photograph and according to the photographer, was inspired by Thomas Hart Benton's painting Persephone, which portrays a voyeur observing a nude woman reclining against a tree, who had been bathing in a stream. Background Dater had been familiar with Benton's 1938 Persephone painting and its theme of voyeurism since her childhood, and it inspired her to attempt several earlier photos based on that theme. She has said that it \\"really worked\\" with this particular photo, because \\"it's a twist, given that it's two women looking at each other.\\" At the time the photograph was taken, Cunningham was 90 years old and had been a famous photographer for 60 years. Dater had been a friend and admirer for the previous ten years, and considered Cunningham her mentor. The nude model, Twinka Thiebaud, was the daughter of painter Wayne Thiebaud. Dater had earlier photographed Twinka fully clothed, in 1970. The photograph was taken as part of a workshop called \\"The Nude in the Landscape\\", organized by Ansel Adams, that had about 100 students. Dater was one of the instructors, and Cunningham was a guest lecturer. According to Twinka Thiebaud, the event started out in an undisciplined way. The clueless students swarmed around the nude models, and they \\"pounced like paparazzi\\", and were \\"unruly and disorganized\\". Dater, Cunningham and Thiebaud stepped away from the crowd, and approached the tree. There, as many of the students gathered around her, Dater demonstrated how to work with a model. This photograph was the result. Critical reaction The photo was immediately the subject of feminist critical analysis. In 1974, critic Lucy Dougan wrote that the photo \\"parodies depictions of male voyeurism in the history of Western art, as it playfully amends all those mythical violations of sacred places. It juxtaposes the city against the pastorale: Cunningham's technological baggage of city life/city seeing hangs around her neck in the form of a large camera, but here it is obsolete and new ways of seeing and old narratives come together.\\" She went on to compare the photo to a poem by Kathleen Raine that talks about an old woman's memory of her young breasts, but concludes that the photo has a \\"much lighter tone of heart\\" than the poem. In 1997, critic Sarah Boxer described the photo as \\"Imogen Cunningham sneaking around the trunk of a giant tree in Yosemite National Park and coming upon Twinka, a nude model who has one leg propped on a root and is looking around coyly\\" and called it \\"an amusing play\\" on the goddess Diana. In 1999, critic Margarett Loke said that the photo \\"remains a delightful send-up of a photographer with a nude subject\\". In 2011, critic Donna Stein wrote that \\"Dater reverses the traditional erotic relationship of a leering old man eyeing a voluptuous nude to show two women - youth and old age - confronting each other.\\" Stein reports that the photo \\"pays homage to the Persephone myth as portrayed in a painting by Thomas Hart Benton\\". Legacy John Hildebidle, poet and literature professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has written a poem inspired by the photograph.

Eliza Wohlers, photographed in Dunedin ca 1877 http://natlib.govt.nz/records/23172144 Early life Wohlers was born in 1812 in Bridport, England, to Hannah and William Hanham. She became a dressmaker and married Richard Palmer, a carpenter, in 1838. The couple emigrated to New Zealand in 1839. Little is known of their first years in the colony, other than that Palmer died sometime between 1839 and 1849. Missionary work In 1849 Wohlers was living in Wellington when a Lutheran missionary from Germany, Johan Wohlers, began asking for recommendations for a suitable woman to marry. Eliza and Johan met in July 1849 and were married two months later. Johan had already spent five years on Ruapuke Island in Foveaux Strait, and he took Eliza there to work with him on his non-denominational mission work for the North German Mission Society. A daughter, Gretchen, was born in 1853. Wohlers' work in the mission was wide-ranging. She visited the sick and provided basic nursing care, taught sewing, reading and skills such as butter-making at the mission house, and cared for orphans and needy children. She was considered \\"a tower of strength and character\\", and encouraged the local Maori population to adopt European ideas of hygiene, clothing and education. During the years of the Wohlers's mission, the settlement grew to have wheatfields, a flour mill, cows and sheep, where previously there had been only the uncertain and dangerous income of whaling. Both Maori and Pakeha from around Ruapuke and other Foveaux Strait settlements attended church services at the mission. In 1868 a government-funded school opened on the island, and the family ran it from 1870 to 1884. Wohlers taught reading, spelling and the singing of English hymns. Death Wohlers died in Southland on 14 December 1891, six years after her husband. They are buried together at Ringaringa, Stewart Island, across the water from Ruapuke.

Kapelludden lighthouse Called Sik(a)varp or Sikehamn, the place was already a settlement for fishers in the Middle Ages and a trade center of uncertain importance, though local legendary stories claim that the settlement was so important that John III of Sweden revoked the town's trading privileges after complaints from Borgholm and Kalmar. History Whether the harbor of Sikvarp was really a commercially important place is not clear, and possibly exaggerated, especially since Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666) describes it as a ruinous, derelict market town. No important ancient harbor structure appears to have existed, though there are remains of foundations and mounds. Investigations in 1978 indicated mudflats, shallow pits lined with a layer of clay, and evidence was found of significant herring fisheries.

She defeated long-time incumbent Jim Graham in the Democratic Party primary and won the general election with 75% of the vote in 2014. She is the first woman to represent Ward 1 on the Council and the first D.C. Councilmember to give birth while serving in office. Early life and professional career Brianne K. Nadeau was born into a Jewish family in Michigan, growing up in Grosse Pointe. A Girl Scout for 13 years, she earned a Gold Award, the Scouts' highest honor. Nadeau has said that Girl Scouts taught her to look for work and to leave things better than you found them.\\"Q&A;: District of Columbia Councilmember Brianne Nadeau\\". Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. October 15, 2016. Nadeau graduated from Boston College with a bachelor's degree in political science in 2002. She also earned a master's degree in public policy from American University in 2006. She worked as a scheduler for Congressman John Sarbanes of Maryland. Nadeau worked as a public relations consultant and vice president for Rabinowitz Communications, where she promoted progressive causes for nonprofit organizations. Nadeau was a member of the board of directors of Jews United for Justice, a charitable organization that helps pursue justice and equality in local community. She was active in the District of Columbia chapter of the Anti-Defamation League. Political experience =Advisory Neighborhood Commission= Nadeau served as Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner for district 1B05 from 2007 to 2011. =2014 Campaign for Council and election= Nadeau ran against four-term member of the Council of the District of Columbia Jim Graham in the Democratic Party primary election in 2014. Her candidacy was endorsed by At-large Council Member David Grosso, Ward Six Council Member Tommy Wells, progressive political action committee Democracy for America, and the editorial boards of The Washington Post, the Washington City Paper and Northwest Current. During her campaign, Nadeau emphasized issues affordable housing, transportation, constituent services, and the need to provide long-term solutions to recurring problems. Nadeau criticized Graham for actions he took in 2008 which resulted in the District Council reprimanding Graham for improperly interfering with the awarding of a government contract. Graham said his actions may have been political horse-trading rather than anything illegal or unethical. During the campaign, Graham accused Nadeau of irregularities in connection to a home- buyer program. According to Graham, in 2009 Nadeau had asked Graham and then- Council Chair Vincent Gray for help with a home-buyer program. Nadeau had been approved for the loan two years earlier, but the income-based loan guarantee was reduced because her salary had increased since then. Graham said that signing her letters with her title as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner was inappropriate and unethical. Nadeau defended the letters, saying she was about to lose her home and simply advocated for herself the best way she could. Following an investigation, the Inspector General cleared Nadeau and found that all the allegations were unsubstantiated. Nadeau defeated Graham in the primary election by a wide margin. In the general election, Nadeau was on the ballot with independent Ernest Johnson and Libertarian John Vaught LaBeaume; there was no Republican candidate on the ballot. Nadeau went on to win the general election as well. In 2016, her 2014 campaign was audited by the Office of Campaign Finance. =2018 Campaign for Council= In mid-2017, Nadeau announced that she would run for a second term on the DC Council. As of August 2017, she had outraised her challengers, with approximately one-third of her campaign contributions coming from developers, lawyers, lobbyists, and corporations. Nadeau, along with several other council members, sends out periodic mailers to her constituents. The practice has been criticized as possible taxpayer-funded campaigning. Time on the Council of the District of Columbia Nadeau speaking in 2017 = Human Services Committee = In 2017, Nadeau became Chair of the D.C Council's Human Services Committee.  TANF  In 2015, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, the District's welfare program, was scheduled to terminate benefits for 6,000 very-low income families. Prior to her tenure as chair of the Human Services Committee, Nadeau introduced a bill that would have extended benefits for many of the families scheduled to lose support. As chair, she passed a reform of TANF along the lines of her earlier bill that would not cut benefits.  Homeless Services Reform Act  During Nadeau's tenure as chair, Mayor Bowser in 2017 proposed a bill to reform the District's emergency homelessness system that would increase from one to two the number of documents homeless residents would need to prove their District residency. The bill was opposed by a coalition of homeless services providers for its more stringent proof-of-residency requirements, some of which were moderated. The Washington Post editorial board supported the bill.The District has a chance to address homelessness with reason, not emotion, The Washington Post, December 4, 2017. The reform was passed in May 2018.  Disability Reform  Also during Nadeau's tenure as chair, the Human Services Committee considered reform of the Department of Disability Services to end the practice of civil commitments for persons with intellectual disabilities. The reform passed the Council and will become law on May 18, 2018. = D.C. Fair Elections Act = In December 2015, Nadeau co-introduced the D.C. Fair Elections Act, which would use public funds to match campaign contributions to candidates who agree to accept lower maximum contribution limits. The bill passed the DC Council, and was signed into law by Mayor Bowser in March 2018.VICTORY FOR DEMOCRACY IN DC: MAYOR BOWSER SIGNS FAIR ELECTIONS ACT, U.S. Pirg, March 13, 2018 = Affordable Housing = Nadeau serves on the D.C. Council's Committee on Housing and Neighborhood Revitalization. Nadeau was one of two Councilmembers to vote against a bill that would exempt all single-family homes from the tenant protections of the District's Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act. Nadeau told a reporter that the bill was too broad and did not find a balance between the rights of homeowners and renters. In July 2015, Nadeau proposed emergency legislation to facilitate the sale of land at 965 Florida Avenue NW by the District of Columbia to developers MRP Realty, Ellis Development, and JBG Smith. The city sold the parcels for $400,000, well below their estimated value of between $5 million and $27.6 million. Nadeau defended the decision in an op-ed in the Washington Post. She cited her commitment to affordable housing and explained the District discounted the price of the land in exchange for the developer building 106 units of affordable housing on the site as well as a grocery store with 270 permanent jobs. = Gun Violence = In the wake of the Pulse shooting, Nadeau called on Congress to address gun violence in local communities and stop blocking District laws. In 2017, Nadeau introduced a bill that would authorize a court to issue a temporary civil protection order, temporarily prohibiting someone from having firearms if the court has a reasonable belief that the subject poses an immediate risk to themselves or others. The D.C. Council's Judiciary Committee held a public hearing on the bill on March 22, 2018. = Crime and Policing = Nadeau has come under increasing scrutiny from her constituents for her stance on crime enforcement due in large part to the noticeable increase in crime throughout her ward during her tenure. Despite public statements of concern, her perceived lack of action and the continued violence in her ward has led many residents to call for more and better action to combat the rising crime rate. Nadeau has been critical of police in the district and supported the disbanding of DC Vice Squads in 2015 despite pointed resistance from the DC Police Union. = Baby Boxes = In 2014, Nadeau introduced a bill to provide ‚Äúbaby boxes‚Äù for all newborns in the District to encourage safe sleep practices and reduce the infant mortality rate, which in the District in 2014 was 27 percent above the national rate. The boxes are lined with a firm mattress and a fitted sheet and serve as a bassinet for infants. They come with essential items such as diapers, wipes and onesies. = Street Harassment = Nadeau has spoken publicly about her experiences of street harassment as a woman in public space in the District, including by a government employee on duty in uniform. She introduced a bill to end street harassment in the District. The bill focuses on education and training and creates a task force to study and collect data on the issue. At Nadeau's request, the Council held its first ever hearing on the subject in 2015. = Initiative 77 = Nadeau initially opposed the controversial Initiative 77 ballot measure to eliminate the tip credit for workers who receive tips as part of their wages. When DC voters approved the measure in a referendum, Nadeau opposed the DC Council measure that overturned the vote. =Pepco-Exelon merger= In May 2015, Nadeau opposed the proposed merger between Exelon and Pepco, expressing concerns about the impact on costs and renewable energy. In October 2015, Nadeau changed her position and urged regulators to support the deal, stating that her original concerns had been addressed by a settlement among Exelon, the Mayor, Attorney General, and Office of the People's Counsel that included additional concessions from Exelon. Committees Nadeau serves on the following committees: * Committee on Human Services, Chair * Committee on Government Operations * Committee on Health * Committee on Housing and Neighborhood Revitalization * Committee of the Whole Personal life Nadeau had lived in the District of Columbia for 13 years when she was elected to the Council in 2014. She lives in the Park View neighborhood and is married to Jayson Harpster, a Kaiser Permanente consultant. Nadeau and Harpster's daughter Zoe was born in September 2017. Nadeau is the first D.C. Councilmember to give birth while in office. Nadeau made national headlines when she pumped from the dais while chairing a long hearing. Nadeau stated that she did not want to recess the committee. Nadeau has written about her experience being a working mother on the Council.

In 2013, Iran was one of only four countries known to have committed public executions. In Iran, public executions occurred regularly during the Qajar dynasty but declined with the Persian Constitutional Revolution and became a rare occurrence under the Pahlavi dynasty. With the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, public executions returned on an unprecedented scale. Qajar dynasty Under the rule of the Qajar dynasty (1785‚Äì1925), forms of public execution included hanging, throwing the condemned from the city walls, tying them to the mouth of a cannon and blowing them apart, suffocating them in a carpet, or re-enacting the crime on the criminal. There was also Sham'i ajjin, which entailed making multiple incisions in the body and then lighting candles in the cuts until the person died. Before being brought onto the public scaffold, the condemned was paraded through the bazaar.Abrahamian, 20. By 1890, public hanging replaced more exotic forms of execution. Whereas the failed assassin of Naser al-Din Shah in 1850 died by Sham'i ajjin, and then had his body quartered and blown from cannons, the assassin of Naser al-Din in 1896 was publicly hanged.Abrahamian, 23. Judicial reform came with the Persian Constitutional Revolution. In 1909, executions were restricted to hanging and firing squad.Abrahamian, 24. Pahlavi dynasty Judicial reform progressed in the late 1920s after RezƒÅ ShƒÅh consolidated Pahlavi rule (1925‚Äì1979).Abrahamian, 25. Executions largely occurred away from public view, and capital punishment was primarily restricted to murder, high treason, and armed rebellion.Abrahamian, 26. One rare public execution during this period was the hanging of the doctor of Tehran's Central Jail shortly after Reza Shah was deposed. The doctor and three others were found guilty of murdering political prisoners.Abrahamian, 72. Islamic Republic of Iran Following the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, public executions became commonplace. The overwhelming majority of public executions were carried out by hanging. Often cranes mounted on trucks served as makeshift gallows. The condemned, and in some cases multiple prisoners, generally stood on a platform before a crowd in a stadium or square. The prisoner was lifted high off the ground by crane, with the rope around their neck, leading to a slower death by strangulation. In other instances, the condemned was placed standing on a stool, which was then abruptly removed, leaving the individual to suffocate to death but barely dangling off the ground. According to a 1990 Amnesty International report, \\"Flogging prior to execution is relatively common.\\" In some provincial towns, traditional forms of execution such as stoning were revived for moral offenses.Abrahamian, 126 At stonings, spectators are encouraged to participate by throwing stones at the condemned. In 1990, Amnesty International \\"recorded the first executions carried out by beheading in modern times in Iran.\\" In cases of murder the guardian, or a family member, of the victim has the right to perform the public execution or hire another person to do it. Government authorities have generally avoided publicly executing political prisoners because it generates greater domestic and international outcry. Nonetheless, there have still been instances of political prisoners being publicly executed, in some cases under the pretense of them being drug traffickers.Abrahamian, 130. In prisons like Evin, political prisoners have been forced to watch or even participate in executions by removing dead bodies. In the 1980s, newly arrived inmates passed rows of hanged prisoners when entering through the main courtyard.Abrahamian, 139. The report by the United Nations Secretary-General on the situation of human rights in Iran for the year 2017 notes that of 4,741 executions between 2010 and 2016, 3,210 were based on sentences issued by Revolutionary Courts in Iran.Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of IranSituation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran Societal impact In August 2013, a 12-year-old Iranian boy from the province of Kermanshah accidentally hanged himself while re-enacting a hanging with his younger 8-year-old brother. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the boy was \\"an unexpected victim of a culture of public executions that remains pervasive in the Islamic republic.\\" Whenever executions are carried out publicly in Iran, children are often among the spectators. Iranian journalist Mokhtar Khandani said, \\"In Kermanshah, where I reside, I see in many places that street executions are carried out. At such venues, unfortunately I see a lot of children who are there and witness the scene. In the eyes of some children, it might seem like a game.\\" An Iranian MP talks about more executions and more flogging. On 22 December 2018, Aziz Akbarian chairman of the Parliament‚Äôs Committee on Industries and Mines said in an interview with the local Alborz Radio, ‚ÄúIf two people are thoroughly flogged and if two people are executed . . . it will be a lesson for everyone else,‚ÄùIran MP says flogging and execution good means for market control References Iran Category:Capital punishment in Iran ","title":"Public executions in Iran"},{"id":"42423483","text":"Windsor is a locality in South Australia. It is on the northern Adelaide Plains adjacent to Port Wakefield Road, 34 km southeast of Port Wakefield. The township is largely bypassed by Port Wakefield Road. The township was a private subdivision by George Baker c.1876. By 1876 there was a store and by 1878 there was a school and Primitive Methodist Church, now Uniting Church. In 1884 the Windsor Institute was built, and has served the community as a hall and library for over 130 years. The town had an oval with concrete cricket pitch opposite the school and tennis courts, on Windsor Road. The oval, established by 1883 and used by the Windsor Cricket Club, was also used until the 1960s by the school. The football club joined with Wild Horse Plains to for United in 1921. The school and local football team colours were double blue. The tennis club commenced in 1880s. A post office (1877-1982) and store (1877-1985) operated from 1877 closing after the township was bypassed by Port Wakefield Road. The Windsor School closed in 1971. The district was part of sheep grazing leases from mid nineteenth century. George Baker took up the land in the area in 1860. After the district was surveyed and sold, settlers established mixed farms. This continued until the 1970s with mixed farming, growing grain, lambs, pigs, eggs, poultry and cream. In early days grain was taken to Parham for dispatch to Adelaide. There was a \\"Windsor Separator\\" brand of butter.Clark Family History- descendants of Edward Clark of Marlow. Unpublished.

The Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, and President Halil Bey of the Chamber of Deputies signed the treaty on behalf of the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) and Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov on behalf of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. The Ottoman‚ÄìBulgarian alliance was probably a prerequisite for Bulgaria's joining the Central Powers after Turkey entered the war in November. The treaty of alliance had seven articles. It was a purely defensive pact: it obligated a signatory to go to war only in the event that the other was attacked by another Balkan country. The two powers also agreed not to attack any other Balkan country without first consulting each other. Article IV left open the possibility of Ottoman troops traversing Bulgarian soil to attack another power. In the event of a conflict without prior consultation they pledged neutrality. Bulgaria promised to notify Turkey of any mobilisation on its part, and in Article V Turkey agreed to negotiate an affirmation of the neutrality of Romania. Furthermore, the treaty was to be kept secret and to last for the duration of the general European war. Although shrouded in secrecy like the treaty with Germany negotiated by Minister of War Enver Pasha on 2 August, the Bulgarian treaty was a more coherent and purposeful document. After the signing, the Ottomans continued to press for an expanded offensive alliance directed at Russia, but to no avail. On 22 August (9 August O.S.), Grand Vizier Sait Halim rejected the interpretation of the Ottoman‚ÄìGerman alliance whereby Turkey was bound to go to war when Germany did. He ordered the government ministers to pursue negotiations in different directions: with Romania, Russia, Greece and France. When negotiations for an anti-Russian alliance with Romania also failed, on 30 August the Ottomans suggested to their German allies that a Bulgarian alliance directed at Serbia and Greece was more feasible. The Germans objected, but the Ottomans sent a colonel to Sofia to begin negotiations with the Bulgarian general staff anyway. Even after entering the war, the Ottomans did not make the Germans aware of the existence of their Bulgarian treaty until 17 December 1914; and the Bulgarians did not actually agree to enter the war on the side of the Central Powers until the Convention of Sofia of 6 September 1915.

The chapel dates from the 13th century; today nothing remains but the foundation and the eastern wall, the western wall having fallen down during a storm in 1914. History and description The church (not a parish church) was built in the first part of the 13th century under the auspices of the bishop of the Diocese of Link√∂ping, which included the islands of Gotland and √ñland. The chapel belonged to one of the largest churches of its time on the island. It had a large nave (only the churches at K√∂pingsvik and Hulterstad had larger naves) and a slightly smaller choir, and a small vestry on the north end. The high roof probably created space for lodging pilgrims (that this was a pilgrimage church is suggested also by the dimensions of the nave), and the church was surrounded by a wall, enclosing an area of 67 √ó 55 meters, including a cemetery. In the southeast corner is a spring, which was probably used already in prehistoric times. The building is first mentioned in 1515 and was probably abandoned during the Reformation. The saint for whom the chapel is named is most likely Brigit of Kildare (451‚Äì525), an Irish saint who was particularly venerated in the Link√∂ping diocese, rather than Bridget of Sweden (1303‚Äì1373). English traveler Horace Marryat visited the area and the church in the early 1860s (\\"a ruined chapel of grey stone ‚Äì two peaked gables ‚Äì a graceful ruin\\"), who recounts the legend of Ingeborg Bengtsdotter, landing in this spot with her child, the future Bridget of Sweden, after a shipwreck: Ingeborg and her husband Birger Persson had gone on a pilgrimage to Kildare, to the remains of St. Brigit, and their ship sank off the √ñland coast on the return voyage to Sweden. Cross A stone cross was placed in the 13th century between the chapel and the beach, 3 meters high and 1.9 meters wide, with clover-shaped cross ends. There is a hole in the cross, supposedly intended for a hook on which to hang the offerb√∂ssa. The cross is surrounded by a wall 12 meters in diameter. Excavations in 1978 revealed it was made of limestone, with entrances north and south. A storm in 2007 blew over a neighboring shed, which in turn broke the cross in four pieces; it was restored, reinforced with steel beams, in October 2007. According to Horace Marryat, local lore has it that the cross marks the spot where Bridget of Sweden first set foot on the island.

It was first believed to have been used by Czech player Anton√≠n Panenka, who introduced this technique to the world in the 1976 UEFA European Championship final, when he beat West German goalkeeper Sepp Maier to claim the title for the Czechoslovakian national team. . However it is now believed to have been pioneered by Manchester City and Wales forward Billy Meredith 70 years earlier. https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city- penalty-methods-panenka-19025208 After its sensational debut in the tournament, the Panenka kick has been used on rare occasions and mostly by highly respected players who can deal with the consequences of missing such an attempt. This style of penalty kick is also called Il cucchiaio (\\"the spoon\\") in the Italian-speaking world, cavadinha (\\"little dig\\") in Brazil and penal picado (\\"poked penalty kick\\") in Argentina and elsewhere in South America.  Technique  The aim of the technique is not to chip the ball over the goalkeeper, but to take advantage of the fact that many goalkeepers will dive to either side of the goal in anticipation, rather than waiting to see in which direction the ball is going. It is a very risky technique, because the subtle touch on the ball gives it a very slow speed, thus allowing the goalkeeper to move back from where they jumped, or even to simply remain in the same spot and wait for the ball to fall easily into their hands. In addition, the subtle touch is most easily applied by a taker who slows down as he/she is about to strike the ball, making it possible for the goalkeeper to recognize what the taker is intending. The move is known for only being used by confident penalty takers who dare to risk missing the kick. Some players that have used the Panenka kick have been criticized by the specialized media or their team's members and supporters, especially if they miss it.  History  Panenka in 2013. His original penalty technique has been imitated by many other players. = The original penalty = Anton√≠n Panenka came to international prominence playing for Czechoslovakia in the 1976 European Championship; Czechoslovakia reached the final, where they faced West Germany. After extra time, the result was 2‚Äì2, and so the first penalty shootout in a European Championships final ensued. The first seven kicks were converted, until West Germany's fourth penalty taker, Uli Hoene√ü, ballooned his shot over the bar. With the score 4‚Äì3, Panenka stepped up to take the fifth Czechoslovakian penalty, to win the match under immense pressure. He feigned shooting to the side of the goal, causing West German goalkeeper Sepp Maier to dive to his left, and then gently chipped the ball into the middle of the net. The perceived impudence of the shot, in addition to its success, led a watching French journalist to dub Panenka \\"a poet\\", and his winning kick is one of the most famous ever, making Panenka's name synonymous with that particular style of penalty kick. = Since 1976 = As well as winning the 1976 European Championship, Panenka helped Czechoslovakia come third in the 1980 tournament, after scoring once again in a 9‚Äì8 penalty shootout win. In the finals of the 1982 World Cup, Panenka scored twice with penalties, but these were the only Czechoslovakian goals, and the team did not progress beyond the first group stage. The Panenka penalty has since been successfully performed by many other players, such as Francesco Totti at the UEFA Euro 2000 semi-final, Zinedine Zidane in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final, Sebastian Abreu in the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-final, Andrea Pirlo at UEFA Euro 2012 quarter-final, Lionel Messi in a 2015 La Liga match against Getafe, and Alexis S√°nchez both in the 2015 Copa Am√©rica Final and in an Arsenal 2‚Äì1 win over Burnley in the Premier League (EPL); S√°nchez is the second player to win a major tournament with the Panenka. The penalty has also since been successfully duplicated by Gonzalo Pineda in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, Younis Mahmoud and Omar Abdulrahman in the 2015 Asian Cup, Sergio Ramos at Euro 2012 and in Euro 2016 qualifying, H√©lder Postiga at Euro 2004, John Stones against Juventus at the 2013 International Champions Cup, Jozy Altidore and Alejandro Pozuelo in their first games for Toronto FC, Memphis Depay in a 2018 UEFA Nations League match, and Sofiane Diop in a 2018‚Äì19 Coupe de la Ligue quarter-final penalty shoot-out vs Stade Rennais FC. Indian striker Sunil Chhetri did it multiple times, in 2015 ISL against NorthEast United FC, in 2017 AFC Cup inter-zonal semi-final against April 25 SC, in 2017‚àí18 ISL semi-final against FC Pune City, and in 2019 Intercontinental Cup against Tajikistan. Some notable players who have tried the kick unsuccessfully include Brendon Santalab, Neymar, Micka√´l Landreau,Rog√©rio Ceni, Maicosuel, Raheem Sterling, Marko Deviƒá, Graham Zusi, Robin van Persie, Cristiano Ronaldo, Antonio Cassano and Alexandre Pato. Two players have converted Panenka penalties in important matches in the same stadium where Anton√≠n Panenka first executed it, the Red Star Stadium in Belgrade, both claiming after the match that they were unaware of the stadium's history in this regard. Aaron Ramsey of Wales did this in a World Cup qualifier on 11 June 2017.https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/aaron-ramsey- panenka-penalty-wales-serbia-world-cup-qualifier-a7786161.html Copenhagen striker Jonas Wind did it on 6 August 2019, in his side's 1‚Äì1 draw at Red Star Belgrade in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the 2019‚Äì20 UEFA Champions League. On 7 October 2017, Jozy Altidore of the United States converted a Panenka in a 2018 World Cup qualification match against Panama, the first such attempt in United States history. On 2 December 2017, Anton√≠n Panenka's 69th birthday, Chelsea player Eden Hazard scored a Panenka penalty in a 3‚Äì1 home win over Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge. On 23 October 2019, Alejandro Pozuelo scored twice in a 2‚Äì1 win over New York City FC in the MLS Cup Playoffs Eastern Conference semi-finals, including a 90th minute Panenka-style penalty kick, which was his third of the campaign in that fashion. On 1 July 2020 Lionel Messi scored his 700th career goal against Atl√©tico Madrid with a Panenka penalty.

Open banking, as a concept could be considered as a subspecies to the open innovation concept, a term promoted by Henry Chesbrough. It is linked to shifts in attitudes towards the issue of data ownership illustrated by regulations such as GDPR and concepts such as the open data movement. The banks turn into financial service platforms, technically implemented through a Banking as a Service-concept.  History  In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted a revised Payment Services Directive, known as PSD2. The new rules included aims to promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments through open banking. Support for the concept is not unanimous. Mick McAteer, of the UK Financial Inclusion Centre, thinks that only the tech-savvy will benefit. He says that open banking is \\"a daft idea\\", which will lead to more financial exclusion for those on low incomes. He says it is na√Øve of regulators to expect consumers to own their data and be able to get better deals from banks, and points out the danger of consumers being exploited, either by businesses offering new types of expensive payday loans, or misuse of data and personal information that people have revealed in places such as social media. = United Kingdom =  Competition intervention  In August 2016, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks ‚Äì HSBC, Barclays, RBS, Santander, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Danske Bank, Lloyds and Nationwide ‚Äì to allow licensed startups direct access to their data down to the level of transaction-account transactions. The direction came into force on January 13, 2018, and using standards and systems created by Open Banking Limited, a non-profit created especially for the task. However, enforcement rests with the Competition & Markets Authority. Protection for consumers is the responsibility of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) (for account information and payment initiation services, under the PSD2 directive) or the Information Commissioner's Office (for data). The CMA direction only applies to the nine largest banks and works alongside the broader PSD2 rules that apply to all payment account providers.  Adoption  As of January 2020, there are 202 FCA-regulated providers who are enrolled in Open Banking. Many of them provide financial apps that help manage finances and also consumer credit firms who use Open Banking to access account information for affordability checks and verification. = Adoption in the rest of the world = A number of other countries launched open banking initiatives based on the European and UK models. These were either through industry collaboration or through legislative changes. An open banking project was launched in Australia on the 1 July 2019 as part of the Consumer Data Rights project by the Australian Treasury department and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The CDR legislation was passed by the Australian parliament in August 2019. On 1 June 2017, a group of bankers and fintech experts in Nigeria got together for the Open Banking Nigeria initiative to drive the adoption of common API standards for the country.

REAP played a significant role in defining rice standards in Pakistan. Consequently, Pakistan Rice Standards were established in 1992 for the first time, with support of the Pakistan Standards Institution.  Governance  The Managing Committee is divided into north ((11 members) and south (12 members) zones. In 1998‚Äì99, REAP membership became compulsory for all rice exporters.  Achievements  REAP has 1900 members in the region and is the country's second largest business association. In 1988‚Äì89 REAP members exported over 2 million tons of rice. In 1992, REAP hosted countries from the Persian Gulf region to gather government buyers from Kuwait, Oman, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. During that period about 36,000 tons from private sector were exported. In 1996‚Äì97, while negotiating with the European Commission, REAP obtained abatement in import duties of 250 ECU/ton for Super and/or Kernel Basmati Brown rice. Pakistan has market share of 60,000 tons out of a total market size of about 120,000 tons of Basmati rice.  Other activities  REAP organizes seminars and training workshops to educate growers, millers and traders the latest techniques, bottlenecks faced and how to solve problems like the control of Khapra beetle on rice crops. Pakistan‚Äôs rice exports grew 57 percent during financial year 2009‚Äì10. In 2009, REAP exported basmati rice at an average price of $825 per ton, down 33 percent compared with $1,102 per ton the preceding year. In 2010, Pakistan was exporting rice to 109 countries of the world. In fiscal 2012, rice exports from Pakistan crossed 3.7 million tons, valued at $2.08 billion at an average price of $871 per ton for Basmati rice, and $448 per ton for non-Basmati rice.

It was built in 1908 with rich terra cotta detailing to a design by Cass Gilbert, who would later employ similar terra cotta detailing in his 1910 design for the Woolworth Building. Train service to the station ceased in 1937, and as of 2014 the station was a ruin in poor condition. The Westchester Avenue station is located just to the southeast of the intersection of Westchester Avenue and the Sheridan Expressway, in the Morrisania section of the South Bronx. The Bronx River is a short distance to the east. The structure consists of a taller entry hall portion that stands on solid ground immediately to the west of the tracks, and a shorter waiting room section that is suspended over the tracks on metal beams. Formerly, this section had staircases that led down to low platforms at track level, but these were removed long ago. The entry hall portion has colorful glazed architectural terra cotta ornamentation, including a caduceus near the eaves, topped with the letters NYH. Though this seems to refer to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, the original builder of the station, the caduceus was also the symbol of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, a local commuter railroad that also served the station. Historic use The station was built in 1908 as part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, which expanded its Harlem River Branch line into an electrified main line into New York. The railroad planned twelve new stations along the route to serve local commuters, and commissioned the architect Cass Gilbert to design them. Gilbert, who was already renowned for having designed the U.S. Custom House in Lower Manhattan, produced plans for each of these in a number of different styles, though not all were actually built. For the station at Westchester Avenue, Gilbert chose a richly ornamented exterior with glazed terra cotta details and signage with gold colored metallic lettering. Gilbert would later incorporate glazed terra cotta details into his design for the Woolworth Building, which was completed in 1913. The line became very active with intercity train service, and remains presently as part of the Northeast Corridor between Boston, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. The line failed to attract local commuter traffic, however, particularly once the New York City Subway with its five-cent fare was extended to much of the area beginning in 1920, and the local stations along the route became uneconomical to maintain. New Haven trains stopped serving Westchester Avenue and other local stations in 1931, and all the stations were finally abandoned when the New York, Westchester and Boston ceased operations in 1937. Planned restoration By 2009, the Westchester Avenue station was in an advanced state of disrepair and in danger of collapse. Three other Gilbert stations, all in the Bronx, were also extant. One of these, the Bartow/City Island Station, was also abandoned and near collapse, while the other two, somewhat altered, have found other uses, Morris Park as a gun club and Hunters Point as a commercial building. Amtrak owns the station and the land it occupies and has listed it as a trackside structure in need of demolition. The New York Landmarks Conservancy, a private advocacy group, has placed the station on its list of endangered landmarks in New York City, but no governmental agency has extended protection or even recognition to the structure. It is not a designated New York City landmark nor is it listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Several proposals for restoration and reuse have come and gone over the years. In 2011, architects Amanda Schachter and Alexander Levi received a grant to develop a new proposal, which they presented in late 2012. Their plan would split the station into two pieces. The tower entry hall would remain where it is and serve as a pedestrian entryway to Concrete Plant Park, which was completed in 2010, and to the Bronx River Greenway, which was still under development at the time. The waiting room portion over the tracks would be removed and rebuilt very nearby on a pier in the Bronx River. This plan gained some notice in the press, but as yet no source of funding for the project seems to have been identified. In July 2015 the plan was integrated with the Bronx River Greenway extension plan.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987. . Early life and education Myer was born September 4, 1891, in Hebron, Ohio. He earned a bachelor's degree from Ohio State University in 1914 and an M.A. in education from Columbia University in 1926. From 1914 to 1916, he taught agronomy at the University of Kentucky. He eventually transitioned into government work, taking a federal job with the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in 1933. He continued his work with the Department of Agriculture, becoming assistant chief of the Soil Conservation Service in 1938.Imai, Shiho. \\"Dillon Myer\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved August 26, 2014. War Relocation Authority Myer was appointed to lead the War Relocation Authority on June 17, 1942, and ran it until its dissolution in 1946. He replaced Milton Eisenhower, who had opposed the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans and resigned after 90 days.Niiya, Brian. \\"Milton Eisenhower\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved August 26, 2014. Myer would eventually come to agree that the internment was a mistake, but believed that the resettlement efforts he headed toward the end of the war worked toward correcting it. One of his first actions as WRA Director, Myer established a formal leave program to allow citizen Nisei to exit camp for work outside the exclusion zone. (Kibei, citizens who had spent considerable time in Japan and were viewed by the WRA with suspicion, and non-citizen Issei were prohibited from leaving the camps.) The leave clearance program helped alleviate overcrowding in some of the camps and, especially important for Myer, began the process of resettling an inmate population that would have to be released at the end of the war, although it was met with heavy opposition in some states where anti-Japanese prejudice remained high. One historian characterized Myer as a principled hero struggling to end the program in the face of a broad, fear-driven movement perpetuating it.Hamby, Alonzo L. \\"Under Suspicion,\\" review of Greg Robinson, By Order of the President: FDR and the Internment of Japanese Americans. New York Times. November 4, 2001. Myer himself told an ACLU conference in 1944 that \\"super-patriotic organizations and individuals\\" and Hearst newspapers on the West Coast were hindering the resettlement of tens of thousands of \\"harmless\\" detainees eligible to leave the camps.New York Times. \\"Scores Opponents of War Relocation: Head of the Authority Says Organized Groups Hinder Aid to U.S. Japanese.\\" Feb. 13, 1944. In July 1943, Myer was called to testify before a subcommittee of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Triggered in large part by news of the resettlement program, and fed by ongoing rumors that the WRA was \\"coddling\\" inmates while the larger public suffered from wartime shortages, the Dies Committee was charged with investigating potential fifth column activity in the camps. The Committee's final report was anti-climactic; Myer was able to disprove the more inflammatory claims, and the suggestions the Committee did offer were for the most part in line with existing WRA policies.Niiya, Brian. \\"Dies Committee\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved August 26, 2014. One of these policies, and the main criticism of Myer's administration of the WRA, was the push for assimilation among Nisei resettlers. Early in 1943 Myer had established WRA field offices in Chicago and Salt Lake City, two cities that received a significant number of those released on work leave. The offices provided support to Japanese Americans, helping them find employment and housing in communities where discrimination was widespread, but WRA workers, following Myer's directive, also encouraged Nisei to \\"blend in\\" by avoiding speaking Japanese or spending time with other Japanese Americans. Leave policy was to disperse former inmates so that there would be no large congregations of Japanese American communities or reestablishment of the pre-war Japantowns. Myer continued work with an advisory council established by his predecessor and headed by Japanese American Citizens League leader Mike Masaoka (a controversial figure in himself), and the WRA and JACL together emphasized hyper-patriotism and assimilation with white Americans as the primary means for Japanese Americans to achieve success.Drinnon, Richard T. Keepers of Concentration Camps: Dillon S. Myer and American Racism (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987) pp 72-73. Additionally, while Myer was supportive of the \\"good\\" Nisei who were eligible for leave clearance, those who were seen as \\"troublemakers\\" ‚Äî mostly protestors and those who failed the so-called \\"loyalty questionnaire\\" ‚Äî were removed from the general population and sent to segregated maximum security camps. President Harry S. Truman awarded Myer the Medal for Merit for his work at the Authority, and in 1946 the Japanese American Citizens League honored him for his \\"courageous and inspired leadership.\\" In 1971, he published Uprooted Americans: the Japanese Americans and the War Relocation Authority during World War II.Myer, Dillon S.

Early in Myer's tenure, Oliver La Farge, then President of the Association on American Indian Affairs, expressed optimism based on Myer's record that he and new Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman would offer tribes more assistance and less paternalism.La Farge, Oliver. \\"Not an Indian, But a White-Man Problem: More guidance and less paternalism is urged to alleviate poverty and ignorance of redmen.\\" New York Times. April 30, 1950. Instead, Myer accelerated the termination policy begun in the 1940s to withdraw the federal government from Indian affairs and liquidate Indian property, ultimately an \\"abject failure.\\"Anderson, Robert T., Bethany Berger, Philip P. Frickey, and Sarah Krakoff. American Indian Law: Cases and Commentary. St. Paul: Thomson Reuters, second edition (2010). Pp. 142-145. Myer's supported termination so avidly that a year into Myer's tenure at BIA, Harold Ickes (former United States Secretary of Interior and a key figure in implementing the New Deal), called Myer \\"a Hitler and Mussolini rolled into one.\\"Prucha, Francis Paul. The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians. University of Nebraska Press, 1984. . Preview at Google Books. (quoting The New Republic 124:17 (May 1951). Ultimately, Myer faced \\"vigorous\\" criticism from the AAIA, for example in its opposition to his effort to broaden the powers of Bureau law-enforcement officers.New York Times. \\"2 Congress Bills on Indians Scored: Measures to Widen the Police Powers of U.S. Bureau Called Un-American.\\" March 27, 1952. Despite comparing Bureau policy under Myer to the Japanese internment, \\"designed to reduce Indians to the condition of prisoners of the bureau,\\" Felix S. Cohen nevertheless told the House Interior Committee that he believed Myer to be \\"a man of the highest integrity.\\"New York Times. \\"U.S. Laws on Indians Called Un-American.\\" March 1, 1952. =Indian termination policy= From the time Myer joined the Bureau of Indian Affairs, he \\"felt very strongly that the Bureau of Indian Affairs should get out of business as quickly as possible but that the job must be done with honor.\\" He was surprised to learn that the large majority of Indians did not support termination policies, but attributed this to lack of understanding by some well-meaning people coupled with deception by some lawyers who worked prominently with tribes (see \\"Tribal legal representation\\" below). Myer's administration of the Indian termination policy was consistent with his continued support for: * Withdrawing federal recognition and trust responsibility from tribes supposedly ready to support themselves, advanced in Congress especially by Senator Arthur Watkins * Relocating Indians from reservations to major cities * Transferring the Bureau's educational functions to local public schools or state departments of education * Transferring agricultural extension to the state extension services * Withdrawing the Bureau from providing health services (including its operation of about 60 hospitals) * Subjecting tribal lands to state law enforcement jurisdiction Upon leaving office, he wrote to his successor Glenn L. Emmons: \\"In order to implement these proposals and for the benefit of the Indians a strong hand will have to be taken both by the Department [of the Interior] and Congress.\\" =Tribal legal representation= As early as 1950, reformer John Collier (who himself had led BIA for 12 years) accused Myer of taking a stance of \\"personal patronage\\" toward tribes through his control over Indian legal affairs.New York Times. \\"Policy on Indians Scored: Ex-Official Says Bureau Head Views Affairs as Patronage.\\" December 2, 1950. Myer later credited Collier's disfavor to an inadvertent dispute in 1942 over the future of Japanese internees at the Poston War Relocation Center, located on the Colorado River Indian Reservation, when Collier was BIA commissioner and Myer headed the War Relocation Authority.Myer, Dillon S. An Autobiography of Dillon S. Myer. 1970. Manuscript available at Open Library (accessed April 12, 2014). Serious controversy arose when Myer drafted and the Department of the Interior promulgated proposed regulations that would allow Myer to veto contracts for legal representation between tribes and attorneys. The move to control tribal legal representation grew out of frustration by Democratic members of Congress with lawsuits brought on behalf of tribes by a few particular lawyers, especially Felix S. Cohen, architect of the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act and author of the Handbook of Federal Indian Law. Myer viewed Cohen, counsel for the Association on American Indian Affairs; and James E. Curry, counsel for the National Congress of American Indians, as examples of lawyers who deliberately misled Indian tribes and the public, using Indian organizations as fronts to advance their own financial interests in tribal representation contracts and consulting fees. Opponents of Myer's regulation included the National Congress of American Indians, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Association on American Indian Affairs, a number of individual tribes,Leviero, Anthony. \\"Indian War Whoop Marks Hearings.\\" Jan. 4, 1952. New York Times. and much of the legal profession, including the American Bar Association. Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman finally laid the controversy to rest by abandoning Myer's regulation, leaving in place 1938 regulations dating to the tenure of John Collier.Leviero, Anthony. \\"Curb on Lawyers of Indians Lifted.\\" New York Times.

She competed at the 1932 Summer Olympics in the 100 m and 4 √ó 100 m events and finished in fourth place in the relay. Biography Schuurman was the third daughter in a family of educators ‚Äì her father was the principal of an elementary school. In her early years she trained in athletics in summers and in gymnastics in winters. In 1929 she won her first athletics competition and in 1930 set her first national and world records in the 100 m at 12.0 s. The same year she won two silver medals in the sprint at the 1930 Women's World Games. In 1932 she improved her world record to 11.9 s and was an Olympic favorite. However, she could not concentrate during the games, partly due to a long trip to Los Angeles and lack of coach there. She made a false start in the semifinals and then finished fourth, missing the final. After returning home she trained hard for the 1936 Games, winning the national titles in the 100 m, 200 m and long jump in 1933 and 1934. However, at the 1934 Women's World Games she severely tore her muscle in the first event, the 60 m, and dropped out of competitions. Schuurman came from a political engaged family, members of the SDAP and knew a lot about politics. When Hitler ruled out Jews to the Olympic games she refused to participate as an athlete. She wouldn' t walk for Hitler even if this was the only and last opportunity to an Olympic medal. Later she worked as an assistant at a dental clinic, a pedicure practitioner and athletics coach. In 1948 she saved two girls from drowning off the coast of Vlieland. In 1952 she moved to Amsterdam, where she ran a pedicure shop until 1965. She died in 1994 aged 81.

Biography Arthur James Stark was born in Beaufort Row, Chelsea on 6 October 1831, the only son of James Stark, the landscape painter, by his wife Elizabeth Young Dinmore.Day, East Anglian Painters, volume II, pp. 80-82. He was christened at St Luke's Church, Chelsea, on 2 November 1831.Arthur James Stark in \\"Parish registers for St. Luke's Church, Chelsea\\", FamilySearch (Arthur James Stark). An artistic aptitude was early fostered by lessons from his father, with whom he was close to all his life. Between 1839 and 1849, when the family was residing at Windsor, young Stark studied animal painting under Edmund Bristow, an intimate friend of the family, and acquired a love of the Thames valley, where he found the subjects of many of his pictures. As early as 1848 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution, his first picture at the Academy being hung on the line between works by Edwin Landseer and Sir Francis Grant. In 1849 James Stark relocated to London for the sake of the education of his son, who entered the Royal Academy schools in the same year. During that time the family lived at 34, Norfolk Street. For some time young Stark used to paint in the stables of Messrs. Chaplin & Home, the carriers, and at a later period he rented for three years at Tatter- sail's a studio where he perfected his painting of horses. His ability became known, and in 1874, from a fear of hampering his progress, he declined a private offer of the post vacated by the death of Frederick William Keyl, an animal painter to Queen Victoria. For many years he taught art in London as well as painted. In 1886, he retired to Nutfield, Surrey, where he devoted the remainder of his life exclusively to painting. Stark worked until within a few days of his death at Thombank, South Nutfield, Surrey, on 29 Oct. 1902. He was cremated at Woking, and a tablet was placed to his memory in Nutfield old church. His portrait in miniature by H. B. Love (1837); in oil, as a child, by Charles Hancock, and in watercolour by his wife (1883) are in the possession of his widow. He married on 20 Nov. 1878, at Ascot, Rose Isabella youngest daughter of Thomas Fassett Kent, counsel to the chairman of committees in the House of Lords. A daughter was born in 1879 and a son, James Arthur, was born 1881, both of whom survived him. Style and works Stark was one of the last artists of the Norwich School (of which his father was a chief disciple), and probably the only one to acquire a reputation for animal painting. The minute touch of his earlier work shows the strong influence of his father, but his later pictures display a more marked individuality and abandon many of the traditions of his father's school. He was fond of depicting homely English scenes, such as haymaking, harvesting, and the farmyard; his landscapes were largely derived from the Thames valley (especially the neighbourhood of Sonning), Surrey, and Norfolk. He painted both in oil and water-colour. Between 1848 and 1887 he exhibited thirty-six pictures at the Royal Academy, thirty-three at the British Institution, fifty-one at the Society of British Artists, three at the Institute of Painters in Water Colours, and fifty-seven at other galleries. Among his works were A Water Mill (1848), Forest Scene (1850), Interior of a Stable (1853), A Quiet Nook (1857), A Shady Pool (1861), In Moor Park, Rickmansworth (1865), Timber Carting (1874), A Farmyard (1875), and Dartmoor Drift (1877) ‚Äî the last-named was one of his best paintings. A watercolour drawing of Calves is at the Victoria and Albert Museum; three water-colours, Interior of a Windmill (on Reigate Heath) fitted up as a Chapel, Windmill and Cottage and Heath Scene, are at the British Museum, and his oil painting Dartmoor Ponies is in the Norwich Castle Museum. Exhibitions of works by him were held at the Dudley Galleries, 169 Piccadilly, in Oct. 1907 and Oct. 1911.

It existed between 1937 and 1939 and was intended to be a Tver Karelians autonomy. Its administrative center was located in the town of Likhoslavl. The population of the okrug was 170,000, of which 65% were Tver Karelians. History Karelian National Okrug was established on July 9, 1937 by the decree of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. It included four previously established districts of Kalinin Oblast ‚Äî Likhoslavlsky (with the administrative center in the town of Likhoslavl), Maksatikhinsky (urban-type steelement of Maksatikha), Rameshkovsky (selo of Rameshki), and Novokarelsky (selo of Tolmachi) districts, as well as of the newly established one, Kozlovsky District (selo of Kozlovo). The karelian population of the Okrug was about 95 thousands, whereas about 25 thousands Tver Karelians lived in districts of Kalinin Oblast which were not included into the Okrug. After the creation of the Okrug, a large effort started in creation of written Tver Karelian language, led by the philologist Dmitry Bubrikh. Tver Karelian first used the Latin alphabet, but in September 1937 central authorities ordered that it should be switched to the Cyrillic alphabet. In January 1938, during the Great Purge, Bubrikh was arrested and charged with counter-revolutionary activity. He was sentenced to death, but his sentence was subsequently commuted. Later, other specialists working on Tver Karelian language, as well as the authorities of the Okrug, were arrested. Most of them were subsequently acquitted. On February 7, 1939 the okrug was abolished, and the districts were subordinated to Kalinin Oblast. During the subsequent changes in the administrative divisions, Novokarelsky District was split between Likhoslavlsky and Spirovsky Districts, and Kozlovsky District was split between Spirovsky and Maksatikhinsky District. Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast. Thus, the former area of Karelian National Okrug is currently split between Likhoslavlsky, Maksatikhinsky, Rameshkovsky, and Spirovsky Districts.

Biography Symons was the elder son of William Martyn Symons by his wife Elizabeth White. His father, who came originally from Trevice, St. Columb, Cornwall, carried on a printing business in Bridge Street, Vauxhall, where Christian, his second child, was born on 28 November 1845, There was one other son and two daughters, of whom the elder, Annie, survives. Symons was educated at a private school in Penzance until he was sent at an early age to the Lambeth Art School, then under the direction of a teacher of repute named Sparkes. In 1866 he entered the Royal Academy as a student for a short while, gaining that year a silver medal in the antique school. In 1869 for the first time one of his works (a portrait of his sister) was hung at the Academy Exhibition, to which he was an intermittent contributor until the year of his death, when he was represented by an 'Interior of Downside Abbey.' His easel pictures were also shown at the New English Art Club, the Institute of Painters in Oil, and various other galleries. In 1870 he was received into the Roman Catholic church, and began his long connection with the firm of Lavers, Barraud and Westlake, for whom he designed a number of stained windows. Symons became a member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1881, but seceded with James McNeill Whistler in 1888. He only came personally before the public in 1899, when he acted as secretary to the celebrated dinner organised in honour of Whistler on 1 May. In 1899 he began the execution of his commission for certain mosaic decorations at Westminster Cathedral, the work by which he was chiefly known until the posthumous exhibition of his paintings and watercolours at the Goupil Gallery in 1912. He worked at Newlyn in Cornwall for some time, and though never a member of the school associated with that locality he contributed an account of it to The Art Journal in April 1890. In later life he lived almost entirely in Sussex. He died at Udimore, near Rye, where he is buried, on 4 Sept. 1911. Personal life He married at Hampstead in 1885 Cecilia, daughter of J. L. Davenport of Wildemlow, Derby. He left nine children. two daughters and seven sons, all of whom survive him. The eldest, Mark Lancelot, a painter of portraits and subject pieces, exhibits occasionally at the New English Art Club. Works Symons was better known to a limited circle as a decorator and designer than as a painter. His varied talents, though recognised by fellow artists, with all of whom he was personally very popular, were insufficiently appreciated by the public during his lifetime. A retiring, over-modest nature accounted in some measure for his ill-success. His mosaic work at Westminster Cathedral consists of the chapel of the Holy Souls, the altar-piece of 'St. Edmund blessing London' in the crypt, and the panel of the 'Veronica' in the chapel of the Sacred Heart, and that of 'The Blessed Joan of Arc' in the north transept. The unpleasant technique (opus sectile) employed for some of these, in accordance with Bentley's instructions, has hardly done justice to their fine design and courageous colour. They have been criticised for an over-emphasis of pictorial illusion, to which the medium of mosaic is unsuited. The defect was probably due to misapprehension, common among all modern ecclesiastical authorities, with regard to the functions of mosaic decoration. Another characteristic example of the artist's powers may be seen in the spandrels at St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate. One of his best oil pictures, 'The Convalescent Connoisseur,' is in the Dublin Municipal Gallery of Modem Art. In the Mappin Art Gallery at Sheffield are 'In Hora Mortis' and 'Home from the War.' 'The Squaw' belongs to the Contemporary Art Society. The British Museum, the Manchester City Art Gallery, and the Brighton Art Gallery possess characteristic examples of his watercolours. His flower pieces are of particular excellence. Mr. Le Brasseur of Hampstead possesses the largest collection of his paintings. Symons was obviously influenced by Sargent and Brabazon, but preserved his own individuality and did not allow his art to be affected by his friendship for Whistler.

Early life As a child, Sioen studied classical music and flute at Ghent Academy. Whilst there, he also learnt African percussion with Chris Joris and later flamenco percussion (Cajon). In the early 1990s he went to the Don Boscocollege in Zwijnaarde. At age sixteen, he auditioned to a Ghent rock group \\"Medium\\". Soon he started writing his own songs, first on guitar, but later on piano. The instrument gave him more opportunities to develop his own style, \\"percussion with nuts\\", as he called it. Under the recommendation of good friend and, later manager, Tom De Clercq, he took his first solo demo \\"S\\" in September 2000. Career =Debut= Together with Tom De Clercq, Sioen founded vzw Keremos, a Vzw (or association without lucrative purpose) which still supports young talent (with groups like Absynthe Minded, Jerboa, Trixie Whitley, Roadburg, Steak Number Eight). Through the band Ghalia Benali & Timnaa, who were under the Keremos association, Sioen contacted violinist Renaud Ghilbert. After a session backstage in Hamburg, they decided to work on a project together. After many experiments with an additional guitarist, with extra strings, with backing vocalists, a fixed band was formed with Jacob Nachtergaele on drums and Jesse Vrielinck. Pieter-Jan De Smet (PJDS) produced their debut album 'See You Naked' which was released in March 2003. \\"Cruisin\\", the first single from the album, immediately topped the charts in Belgium. After more and more performances at larger festivals in 2003, Sioen received an offer to write the soundtrack for the film Team Spirit II. The accompanying second single \\"Another Ballad\\" was equally successful. =Breakthrough= At the start of 2004, in support of the 3rd single \\"Boom!\\", Sioen invited some special guests to the Ancienne Belgique for \\"Sioen says Boom!\\": Marie Daulne (Zap Mama), Gabriel Rios and Flip Kowlier, extra strings, an additional keyboardist Peter Lesage and 3 backing vocalists (the sisters Gysels, now also Arsenal and Zita Swoon). Sioen went on to play at Rock Werchter, Francofolies, Ghent Festivals, Dour Festival, Lokerse Feesten, Martkrock Leuven and Dranouter Festival. It became the biggest live breakthrough for Sioen, and he was praised for his strong live reputation. The newspaper De Morgen placed Sioen at the top 10 performances of Rock Werchter that year and \\"Sioen says Boom!\\" was repeated for 20,000 people in Dranouter's big tent with Toots Thielemans as a special act. In 2004, Sioen played 130 performances at festivals and theaters, and the year was also the year of international trips. The album \\"See You Naked\\" was released in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Jawel, South Korea, where Cruisin became a top 10 hit and Sioen became Breaking New Artist. =Continued success= In addition to a nomination for Best Song for \\"Cruisin\\", Sioen won Best Newcomer at ZAMU 2003, and was nominated as Best Composer for his Team Track II soundtrack at the Joseph Plateau Awards. In addition, he received a gold record for the first time, for the more than 25,000 sold copies of \\"See You Naked\\". The pressure to live up to this success was very present at the recording of \\"Ease Your Mind\\", Sioen's second full album, which was recorded with his backing band; Jeroen Baert on violin, Laurens Smagghe on drums, David Bratzlavsky on guitar and Matthias Debusschere on bass. Behind the buttons of the Caribbean Studio (Brussels) was producer Denis Moulin, son of Marc Moulin, and for the mix Eric Sarafin flew from the United States, who was also involved with Ben Harper's records. On the last track of the Sleeping Beat album, Thielemans once again surprised with his participation. The appearance of 'Ease Your Mind' on 4 April 2005, translated into \\"Ceci N'est Pas Un Film\\". From theKopergietery, a small theater in Ghent, was broadcast to various cinemas at home and abroad. Eventually more than 5,000 people would have seen the live concert. Later that year there was also a DVD of the concert and an additional documentary that was premiered at the renowned Gent Film Festival. The big festivals followed, a second time Rock Werchter and the Lokerse Festivals as a premiere of Patti Smith. Sioen also played more and more abroad and a release in Germany was awarded a sold-out room in Berlin. The album would also be released in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. At A Glance, the second single of the record, was accompanied by an animation clip that was included in the selection worldwide at international animation festivals. =0110 Concerts= After a sold-out acoustic theater tour \\"In No One's Interest\\" (March 2006) with Jeroen Baert (violin) and Laurens Smagghe (drums), the adventure continued to Beijing, China, where Sioen was invited to the city festival. With Baert and Smagghe, and now Fritz Sundermann on guitar and Sjang Coenen on bass, Sioen eventually appeared to have found his permanent formation. 2006 became the year of '0110: Concerts for tolerance against racism' and together with Tom Barman (dEUS) and Arno as pacemakers and a team of hundreds of volunteers, concerts were held on 1 October in Brussels, Antwerp, Charleroi and Ghent (where Sioen hosted) by many different artists: Clouseau, Helmut Lotti, Will Tura, DEUS , Gorki, Arno, Flip Kowlier, Gabriel Rios. The performances took over 55,000 people and despite the bad weather, the day was in unseen solidarity. In 2006, Sioen also received a golden record for \\"Ease Your Mind\\". Sioen and Sowetto In November 2007, Sioen drew up an invitation to Oxfam's \\"One Day For Another World\\" action to the Soweto township in South Africa to collaborate with local musicians. He met live legend Pops Mohamed (cora, kalimbe, bira) and Khaya Mahlangu (saxophonist for, among others, Hugh Masekela) and together with Stella Khumalo (backing vocalist for, among others, Miriam Makeba) he organized an audition in the heart of Soweto, from which 4 gorgeous backing vocalists were selected. During the Ghent Festivals 2008, he brought the musicians to Belgium and the performance that broke out of melody and energy became a spontaneous success and the talk of the town. De Standaard wrote: \\"We always have sympathy for someone who gives a new repertoire a fire baptism to the public. Sioen also managed to shine!

Supported by the enthusiasm of the audience, Sioen co-founded with Gentenaars Laurens Smagghe (Sioen's solid drummer), Mirko Banovic (bass at Arno and Arsenal) and Frederik Segers (guitarist members of Marvelas) to Johannesburg to join the South- African musicians to record the \\"Calling Up Soweto\\" record. And this in the legendary studios where Paul Simon's record \\"Graceland\\" was recorded. Sioen and Binti Sioen is regularly accompanied by Binti, six singing sisters from Ghent, since early 2012. They performed a live performance of \\"Blackout\\" at Studio Brussels and on 23 March 2012, Binti played in the premiere at the CD performance of the album \\"Sioen\\" in the Ghent forwards. They also provided the backing vocals during the main program of the evening. Het Nieuwsblad wrote: \\"That Sioen has many faces came true again in a series of songs that the six sisters of Binti could bring along.

Biography Vallance was born at Paisley on 13 Feb. 1827, the youngest son in the family of six sons and one daughter of David Vallance, tobacco manufacturer, by his wife Margaret Warden. William, whose father died in William's childhood, was sent at a very early age to work in a weaver's sho ; but on the family's subsequent removal to Edinburgh he was apprenticed in 1841 as a carver and gilder to Messrs. Aitken Dott. During his apprenticeship he began to paint, and made a little money by drawing chalk-portraits ; but he was twenty-three before he received any proper instruction. He then worked for a short time in the Trustees' Academy under E. Dallas, and later, from 1855, studied under R. S. Lauder. Vallance commenced to exhibit at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1849, but it was not until 1857 that he took up art as a profession. His earlier work had been chiefly portraiture and genre. After 1870 he painted, principally in Wicklow, Connemara, and Galway, a series of pictures of Lish life and character, humorous in figure and incident, and fresh in landscape setting. But a year or two spent in Leith in childhood had left its impress on his mind, and it was as a painter of the sea and shipping that he was eventually best known. His first pictures of this kind hovered between the Dutch convention and the freer and higher pitched art of his own contemporaries and coimtrymen. Gradually the influence of the latter prevailed, and in such pictures as 'Reading the War News' (1871), 'The Busy Clyde' (1880), and 'Knocking on the Harbour Walls' (1884) he attained a certain charm of silvery lighting, painting with considerable, if somewhat flimsy, dexterity. Probably, however, his feeling for nature found its most vital expression in the water-colours, often in body-colour, which he painted out-of-doors. Vallance was elected associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1875, and became academician in 1881. In later years he was living in a large Georgian flat at 47 Great King Street in Edinburgh's Second New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office directory, 1905-6 He died in Edinburgh on 30 August 1904. On 2 January 1856 he married in Edinburgh Elizabeth Mackie, daughter of James Bell, and by her had issue two sons and six daughters. His widow possesses a chalk portrait of him as a young man by John Pettie, R.A.

He had been particularly noted for his work on industrial and music films, and is considered one of the most important renewers of these genres in Germany. His style is credited to have influenced and helped create the modern music video. His feature-film documentary Alvorada was nominated for an Academy Award in 1963. Biography =Early life= Hugo Niebeling was born and raised in D√ºsseldorf. As a child, he was evacuated to the countryside during World War II. Once the war ended and he returned home, he found his parents' music store destroyed by bombs.Thommes 2008, , p. 102 Niebeling developed an interest in modern art, classical music and theatre, but was unable to study acting for financial reasons, and therefore enrolled in a business degree at the Mannesmann-AG in D√ºsseldorf. Parallel to that, he studied acting privately with Otto Str√∂hlin, an actor at the D√ºsseldorf Schauspielhaus who had many pupils. Niebeling's role model was Gustaf Gr√ºndgens, a famous theatre actor.Thommes 2008, , pp. 102‚Äì104 After working as a theatre actor for a while in Augsburg, Niebeling turned to directing. As a teenager, he had already expressed his thoughts about his definition of art ‚Äì which he has kept unchanged since: =Industrial/Experimental films= In 1957, Niebeling directed his first film St√§hlerne Adern, a documentary about steel-production at Mannesmann AG, inspired by the German experimental director Walter Ruttmann. This film won many accolades and led to Niebeling directing numerous much-acclaimed industrial and experimental films during the early 1960s. They combine stylized cinematography and editing with experimental scores, often in collaboration with Oskar Sala. His short film Stahl - Thema mit Variationen is a good example, being an audivisual poem on steel-production, using only sound and image to explain its subject without any voice-over or other narration. In 1962, Niebeling created the Oscar-nominated documentary Alvorada - Brazil's Changing Face, which received numerous awards. His experimental industrial film Petrol was the only West German film screened at Cannes Film Festival 1965, and went on to become one of the most awarded industrial films worldwide.Thommes 2008, , pp. 188-189 The documentary Mit Licht Schreiben (English title: Magic Light), showing production of cameras and filmstock at Agfa, is rather a philosophical look at the nature of photography and reality, featuring highly experimental cinematography and editing, using many different visual styles. Niebeling's combination of music and image in Petrol led to him being asked to work on his music film Pastorale. Niebeling himself called Alvorada his first music-film, and the editing of his early experimental industrial films is often also musical in nature, editing images in rhythm to the soundtrack, often even having the camera move to the music. Despite his career turning more to music-films afterwards, Niebeling still created experimental industrial films throughout the 1970s and 1980s: Allegro in 1970, and Der Auftrag der uns Bleibt in 1984. =Beethoven-Films= From the late 1960s on, Niebeling turned to directing mostly music- and ballet-films. Among them, there are three highly influential and acclaimed filmed versions of Beethoven-Symphonies. All three films are considered revolutionary in the way the visuals complement the music, and many filmic techniques pioneered in these films set trends for the following decades:  Pastorale  In 1967, Niebeling directed a film on Beethoven's sixth symphony Pastorale, performed by the Berliner Philharmoniker and conducted by Herbert von Karajan. In this film, he used highly experimental editing-, camera- and lighting-techniques to set the music to images. The film has been considered seminal in its use of audio and visuals that complement the music. It was filmed in a studio using many takes to allow the performance and individual instruments to be filmed and lit from various angles. It employs filmic techniques highly unusual for a music-film: Sometimes, a handheld camera that moves in sync with the music; the lighting changes according to the music, images are superimposed to create a surrealistic effect, and others.  Eroica and Seventh Symphony  In 1972, Niebeling filmed two more Beethoven-Symphonies: Beethoven's third symphony Eroica and Beethoven's seventh symphony, featuring the same performers as the Pastorale. In them, the orchestra is seated in an arrangement similar to the audiotorium of an ancient Greek theatre. Both were recut heavily against Niebeling's wishes on Karajan's initiative to make their styles more conventional, removing a lot of their experimental style. Niebeling was not involved in editing the versions first released in the 1970s. In the 2010s, Niebeling was able to release the director's cuts of both films: Niebeling's director's cut of \\"Eroica\\" was released in 2010 to positive reviews. He was had been able to keep a black&white; copy of his original workprint in 1972, which he restored. He considers the resulting black&white; aesthetic of the Eroica's director's cut more appropriate to the film. Niebeling's director's cut on the seventh symphony, titled B 7 (Beethoven Seven) was released on German television in 2016, combining music and ballet. Niebeling edited the film based on his original screenplay. Prior to this, Niebeling had first created the short film Apotheosis of Dance in 2015, based on the last movement of the seventh symphony. Ninth Symphony In the 1970s, Niebeling additionally planned a film on Beethoven's ninth symphony, which was supposed to interweave the orchestra, singers and dancers. He had drafted a detailed screenplay, but it was not realized. =Ballet-Films= Giselle, Niebeling's first ballet-film featuring Carla Fracci, Erik Bruhn and the American Ballet Theatre, premiered in 1969 at the Lincoln Centre in New York under patronage of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and was praised for its innovative visual style that complements the ballet-performance. Since the early 1970s, Niebeling often worked in New York City and directed mostly Ballet films in collaboration with the choreographer George Balanchine. In 1991, Niebeling directed a feature-film in Germany showing the passion of Christ based on Bach's Johannespassion, evoking antique tragedy with its combination of music, language and dance. Niebeling planned it for three decades prior to realizing it, and himself considers it one of his most important works.Thommes 2008, , pp. 184-187 =2000s: Retrospectives and new projects=  Retrospectives  2013, the German Historical Museum did a retrospective on Hugo Niebeling. He was present for the screenings, and films from all stages of his career were shown. In 2015, Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival awarded him with its \\"Award of Excellence\\" for artistic innovation. In a retrospective during the festival, many of Niebeling's 1960s works were shown, some of them as US-premieres.  Restoring earlier films  Since the early 2000s, Niebeling had many of his earlier works scanned in 2k or 4k from the original 35mm negatives, and they were color corrected and restored under his supervision. At the time of his death, he had already scanned and restored all his 1960s works plus some of his later works like Der Auftrag der uns bleibt (1984) and Johannespassion (1991).  Chaconne  Until his death, Hugo Niebeling continued to be active as a director, planning numerous new projects. Of particular interest for him was a proposed film on Bach's Chaconne, which he had already planned in detail and which would have interwoven nature and church architecture through montage and cinematography..Thommes 2008, , p. 106  Miscellaneous  Director Alexander Tuschinski (*1988) was a friend of Hugo Niebeling and considers him his mentor. Tuschinski's editing style is influenced strongly by Niebeling's style,. and Niebeling edited the films Apotheosis of Dance and \\"B 7\\" (Beethoven 7) together with him in 2015.

Biography Waller born at the Spa, Gloucester, on 18 June 1850, was son of Frederick Sandham Waller by his wife Anne Elizabeth Hitch. The father, an architect practising in Gloucester, ably restored considerable portions of Gloucester Cathedral in perfect harmony with the original design. Young Waller was educated at Cheltenham College with a view to the army, but showing artistic inclinations was sent to the Gloucester School of Art, and went through a course of architectural studies in his father's office. The training proved of service to him, for many of his pictures have architectural backgrounds. At eighteen he entered the Royal Academy Schools, and three years later (1871) he exhibited his first pictures at Burlington House entitled A Winter's Tale and The Illustrious Stranger. In 1872 he went to Iceland, and published an illustrated account of his travels entitled Six Weeks in the Saddle. In 1873 he joined the staff of The Graphic. The following year he appeared at the Royal Academy with a work called Soldiers of Fortune, and henceforward was a steady exhibitor there until 1902. His chief and best-known pictures were Jealous (1875), now in National Gallery, Melbourne; The Way of the World (1876), Home? (1877), now in the Art Gallery of New South Wales; The Empty Saddle (1879), with an architectural setting taken from Burford Priory, Oxfordshire; Success! (1881) and Sweethearts and Wives (1882), both in the Tate Gallery. Later works are The Day of Reckoning (1883), Peril (1886), The Morning of Agincourt (1888), In his Father's Footsteps (1889), Dawn (1890), One-and-Twenty (1891), The Ruined Sanctuary (1892), Alone! (1896), Safe (1898), My Hero (1902). Old English country life strongly attracted his imagination, and furnished him with the romantic incidents which formed the subjects of his most notable pictures, and their backgrounds were frequently taken from Elizabethan houses in his native county or elsewhere in England. Many of his pictures are well known by reproductions and engravings throughout the English-speaking world. The originals are in many cases in private ownership in America and Australia as well as in England. Waller's great knowledge of horses and his skill in representing them gave his work much vogue among sportsmen. He took great pains in studying animals, and related some of his experiences in articles contributed to the 'Art Journal' (1893-6). His pictures usually tell a story effectively and dramatically, but he was more of an illustrator than a genuine artist. He died at his studio, Haverstock Hill, London, on 14 June 1903, after a long illness, and was buried at Golder's Green. He married in 1874 Mary Lemon, daughter of the Rev. Hugh Fowler of Bumwood, Gloucestershire. His widow, a well-known artist, who exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1877 to 1904, survived him with a son.

Due to this, the last episode of season two had to be hastily rewritten and filmed to accommodate the cancellation and tie up any loose storylines. However, on 25 October 2014, it was announced the show was to be revived by Foxtel for at least two more seasons.

The airport is owned and operated by Arktikugol, which also owns the company town. The airport features a runway, two hangars and an administration building with a control tower. There are two Mil Mi-8 helicopters based at Heerodden, which are operated by Spark+. Flights are provided to Svalbard Airport, Longyear and Pyramiden Heliport. The heliport was built by Arktikugol in 1961 and the company originally flew two Mil Mi-4 helicopters. The airport received a major upgrade between 1975 and 1978, following the opening of Svalbard Airport, Longyear. This saw the number of operative aircraft increase to five and the arrival of the Mi-8, operated by Aeroflot. Operations were cut in the early 1990s, with only two aircraft remaining by 1993. There was a fatal crash at the airport in 2008, killing three of nine passengers. History The heliport was built by the mining company Arktikugol in 1961. In addition to flights around Barentsburg, it was used to fly to the heliport at Pyramiden. Arktikugol originally operated Mil Mi-4 helicopters, with place for eleven passengers.Risanger: 319 The airport was gradually expanded with new infrastructure,Risanger: 305 with the first hangar having a capacity of .Risanger: 310 The Aviation Act applies to Svalbard and from 1961 to 1974 Arktikugol followed this by applying for and receiving a helicopter operating concession from the Ministry of Transport and Communications. After 1974 the Soviet Union stated that the regulations were in violation of the Svalbard Treaty allowing free shipping.Risanger: 317 Heerodden and the heliport The Soviet Union agreed in 1971 to allow the construction of Svalbard Airport, Longyear. The condition was that the airport be built with capacity to allow Aeroflot to operate flights to Moscow. This would again increase the need for the heliport in Barentsburg, as it would be used to fly passengers from Barentsburg to Longyearbyen.Risanger: 260 A major upgrade commenced in 1975, consisting of a new terminal building, hangars and a radar. The upgrades were completed in 1978 and by then there were 20 pilots, 25 mechanics and 20 other employees working and living at Heerodden. Mil Mi-8 helicopter operated by Spark+ in the hangar at Barentsburg Arktikugol increased its fleet to five new Mil Mi-8 helicopters, all with Aeroflot markings.Risanger: 316 Each helicopter has a capacity for 28 passengers and a range of . Following a Jon Michelet article in Klassekampen in 1976 there was a major interest by the Norwegian press concerning the heliport.Arlov: 289 Rumor spread concerning that the airport was illegal and that it was a military installation which in a short time could be transformed into an air base. The lack of initial Norwegian inspections fueled the speculation. The press which underlined that the heliport had a significant higher capacity than the five helicopters actually in use, and that with the heliport's strategic location it could easy be militarized in a conflict.Risanger: 313 Contributing to the speculation was that Arktikugol used military, rather than the civilian, version of the Mi-8. However, there was never any evidence to support the claims.Risanger: 314 The surveillance section of the Governor was however not in doubt that there were agents from the Main Intelligence Directorate.Arlov: 290 There were also speculations that the heliport was planned expanded to a full-length runway which could support fixed-winged aircraft.Arlov: 291 The issue became more tense on 28 August 1978 with the Hopen Accident, when a Soviet Air Forces Tupolev Tu-16 crashed at Hopen. The press started asking if Norwegian authorities had control over the Soviet activities on the island. The Civil Aviation Administration carried out inspections at the heliport in 1979. The Civil Aviation Administration gave an operating permit on 1 August 1980.Accident Investigation Board Norway: 13 Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, subsidies and resources allocated to Svalbard and Arktikugol were diminished. By 1993 there were only two remaining helicopters, and all crew and airport employees were relocated to live in Barentsburg.Holm: 18 Operation were reduced from 1998 when Arktikugol closed Pyramiden.Holm: 108 Facilities The airport seen from Gr√∏nfjorden The heliport is situated at Heerodden, a peninsula north of the town of Barentsburg, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The facility consists of an administration building, a control tower, two hangars and a radar. The airport has a single concrete runway, which is and aligned east‚Äìwest. It connects to the main apron via a wide concrete taxiway. The largest apron area measures . The administration building has meeting rooms and a canteen in the first floor, teaching and technical rooms in the second, apartments in the third and the control tower in the fourth. The building has of residential and office space and of technical rooms. There are two hangars, the smaller being , while the larger is and tall. This allows for the indoor parking of five Mi-8 helicopters. There is hangar capacity for maintenance of one such helicopter at a time. A view of the heliport from the fjord The airport is located in uncontrolled airspace. The tower is manned on days and times with flights. Due to the language barrier, there is no radio communication between the helicopters and heliport on the one side, and Svalbard Airport, Longyear on the other. Yet both airport and helicopters have radios to communicate at Longyearbyen's frequency. Information concerning flights is relayed by fax from the meteorological station at Barentsburg to Longyearbyen.Accident Investigation Board Norway: 14 Airlines and destinations Arktikugol has two Mil Mi-8 aircraft which are operated by Spark+. They are based at the heliport and provide transport services for Arktikugol and the Consulate-General of Russia in Barentsburg for flights to Pyramiden and to Longyearbyen.Accident Investigation Board Norway: 4 The airport is also used by the Governor of Svalbard's helicopter when it visits Barentsburg.Accident Investigation Board Norway: 26 Accidents and incidents On 30 March 2008 a Mi-8 with registration RA-06152 crashed at the airport whilst attempting to land. There had been recent heavy snowfalls at the airport and as the helicopter came into land, its rotor wash disturbed the loose snow, causing the pilots to lose their visual references in what was effectively a highly localised blizzard. The helicopter's course deviated beyond the runway, at an angle of 50 degrees, and crashed into the smaller hangar. Three of the nine passengers were killed in the impact, and three more were seriously injured.Accident Investigation Board Norway: 3 The investigation concluded that the airport needed to improve its procedures for landing in snow, and that the airline needed to improve its crew management and ensure seat belts are worn.

He received but little education, and for a time followed the trade of a cooper; but, possessing great natural abilities, he invented an ingenious camera obscura, and later took up engraving, in which art, although entirely self-taught, he attained to a high degree of excellence. In 1783 he went to Hull, where he resided for a few years, engraving at first shop-bills and tradesmen's cards. His earliest work of a higher class was a portrait of Harry Rowe, the famous puppet-show man, and in 1786 he etched and published a pair of views of the new dock at Hull, which were overlooked by Francis Jukes. Having executed a good plate of a woman's head after Gerard Dou, he obtained from the Marquis of Carmarthen an introduction to John Boydell, for whose large edition of Shakespeare he engraved in the dot manner twenty-two plates after Northcote, Westall, Opie, Peters, and others. Of these the finest is the entry of Cardinal Wolsey into Leicester Abbey, after Westall. Thew also engraved a few excellent portraits, including Master Hare, after Reynolds, 1790; Sir Thomas Gresham, after Sir Anthony More, 1792; and Miss Turner, with the title ‚ÄòReflections on Werter,‚Äô after Richard Crosse.

In 2017 Pacific National won the contract to haul raw sugar to the Port of Townsville for export by Wilmar's Burdekin Sugar mills and the haulage of Proserpine Mills product to the Mackay Harbour. In the first year, 83 Class locomotives (GT42CU ACe) hauled Electronically controlled pneumatic brakes fitted RGWY tandem hopper wagons and (upon request by the sugar mill) RNWY container flats with ex Aurizon AMLU molasses tank containers. Ironically the slogan wrapped on one of the lead or slave wagons \\"Supporting Queensland Industry\\" contradicts itself, the PN sugar fleet was manufactured in China. Due to the increased demand of locomotives required by PN, rumours spread of the spasmodically used 88 Class being sent to Townsville to haul 3 sets of RGWY hoppers for the Burdekin Sugar Mills. On the 23 of March 2019 8804 arrived at PNs Toll North depot in vehicle on 82P9; Moolabin to Townsville Intermodal. The remainder of the class arrived at later dates and work commenced to ready them for testing by the 2019 crush. On the 28 of July 2019, 8805 was the first locomotive to pass preliminary testing and was trialled on service 8Q84. Trialling continued on all members of the class with issues concerning communication between the locomotives and telemetry systems for loading and unloading of wagons. Toward the end of August it was expected an 88 class would usually lead a raw sugar train. After the 2019 sugar season ended, Pacific National began trialling the fleet in their Intermodal Division, having 15 locomotives rostered with little to none to spare. Initially being downgraded to shunting duties in the Townsville region and later Gladstone. Townsville saw the fleet being used on the Toll North to the Port of Townsville cement shunts, often double heading. On one occasion an 88 lead 8CP1 from Townsville to Cairns. With minimal locomotive diversity in the pacific national fleet, crews did not favour the locomotives over GT42s. Resulting in four units being stored in Toll North, except for one unit that operated as a shunting loco in Gladstone, awaiting the start of the next sugar season. The 2020 season saw the class start what they left off the previous year, this time operating test sugar trains for the Burdekin mills that commenced on the 5th of June 2020 prior to the start of the crush.

Battersea, London; 23 June 1921 ‚Äì d. Tweed Heads, New South Wales; 24 May 1993) was a British soldier who saw active service as a signaller with the Special Operations Executive during World War II. Willmott joined the British Army whilst in his teens and rose through the ranks to gain a commission. He saw active service with distinction in Europe, including Poland in September 1939, and was awarded British, French and Dutch decorations. After his British Army service was terminated, Willmott emigrated to New Zealand where he worked in various parts of the security services.Simpson, pp.135‚Äì140 Early life Len Willmott's parents were Arthur Willmott, formerly an army sergeant-major, and Georgette, who was half-French. The family background of Willmott senior was never confirmed ‚Äì it seems certain only that he was not originally called Willmott and changed his name to ensure a complete and utter separation from his past.Simpson, p.152 Early in Len Willmott's life, the family moved to Seaford in Sussex where they lived in poverty. At 7 years old, Len took on a delivery round and at 13, he joined a deep-sea fishing trawler. His relationship with his father had involved frequent beatings, so the relative care and privacy on the trawler were welcome.Simpson, pp.5‚Äì8 Army career Willmott joined the Royal Signals as a boy apprentice on 1 July 1936, at age 15.Simpson, pp.8‚Äì9 During his time in training, he became a respected and highly skilled signaller and participated in the off-duty construction of a wireless transmitter. It is probable that in 1938, as his time as a \\"boy\\" signaller approached its end, he was \\"talent- spotted\\" for extra training which would lead to more than routine service.Simpson, p.14 Instead of the routine posting to a GPO telegraph office (to provide experience), Willmott was called to interviews at the War Office in London; this was an exceptional experience for a seventeen-year-old boy soldier. It was followed by vehicle training in London and, in early January 1939, in Paris. In March he was sent for parachute training at Reading, a rudimentary process at the time. (Willmott was paired with another trainee, an intelligence officer called Templer, later Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer.) In late July, he was sent to Crieff in Scotland for a brief course (the house where this took place had been taken over by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and became known as the \\"auld Spook House\\"), equipped in London and then sent to Germany via Harwich in mid-August, carrying a wireless transmitter in three cases.Simpson, pp.21‚Äì23 =Poland= While waiting for orders near Munich, his destination was abruptly changed to the British Embassy in Warsaw, in Poland. On 1 September, the German invasion of Poland had started and Willmott's journey to Warsaw became disrupted and difficult, he was often on foot and foraging for food.Simpson, pp.24‚Äì26 By the time he arrived, the embassy had closed and the staff had evacuated. He was given shelter by a local family and soon handed over to what became the Polish resistance; in the next few months he was either in hiding and participated in several sabotage and demolition operations. Willmott remained with the resistance until April 1940 before travelling with two other British men (probably SIS agents) through Germany, Belgium and France to neutral Spain, and returning to Britain on a destroyer, in July. While passing through Germany he had posed as an American and obtained help from an English-speaking German officer.Simpson, pp.27‚Äì31 =Mediterranean= =Northern Europe= New Zealand Australia Personal life Awards and decorations * Military Medal (3 February 1944) * British Empire Medal (14 October 1943) * Croix de Guerre with gold star (France, 1945) * Bronze Lion (Netherlands, 5 September 1946) * Resistance Commemorative Cross (Netherlands, 31 October 1986) References Category:1921 births Category:1993 deaths Category:People from Battersea Category:English emigrants to New Zealand Category:Royal Corps of Signals officers Category:Special Air Service officers Category:British Special Operations Executive personnel Category:Recipients of the Military Medal Category:Recipients of the British Empire Medal Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939‚Äì1945 (France) Category:Recipients of the Bronze Lion Category:Recipients of the Resistance Memorial Cross ","title":"Leonard Willmott"},{"id":"42425400","text":"Nikolay Zakharovich Karakulov (; 10 August 1918 ‚Äì 10 March 1988) was a Soviet sprinter who won gold medals at the 1946 and 1950 European championships.

The programme acts as a bridgehead to provide business support services to European enterprises interested to develop their business in Asia. The initiative is rebranded EU Gateway  Business Avenues following the successful implementation of a pilot to South East Asia. It organises one-week business missions to Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and China, encouraging the establishment of long-lasting business collaborations with local companies. EU Gateway  Business Avenues focuses on five technological sectors: Environment & Water, Green Energy, Construction & Building, Healthcare & Medical, Information & Communication; and three other sectors: Contemporary European Design, Food & Beverage (processed organic only in Korea) and Services (China only).  History  Business Avenues timelineIn 1990 the pilot EU Gateway Programme was created pursuing the European and Japanese resolve for equitable access to their respective markets and removing obstacles whether structural or other, impeding the expansion of trade and investment, on the basis of comparable opportunities. 2008 marked a new era in EU Gateway history as the programme was launched in another country, South Korea. In 2014, the EU Gateway programme reached 20 years of history in Japan and 6 years of presence in Korea. Between 2014 ‚Äì 2015, three business missions to Singapore-Malaysia and Singapore-Vietnam were organised, and from 2016 to 2020 the Programme is targeting Korea, China, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia. Since 1979, through business support programmes such as the Executive Training Programme and the EU Gateway Programme, the European Commission encouraged European enterprises' efforts to penetrate the Japanese market. In 1990 the pilot EU Gateway Programme was created pursuing the European and Japanese resolve for equitable access to their respective markets and removing obstacles whether structural or other, impeding the expansion of trade and investment, on the basis of comparable opportunities. In July 1991, the European Community member states and Japan, agreed to \\"pursuing their resolve for equitable access to their respective markets and removing obstacles whether structural or other, impeding the expansion of trade and investment, on the basis of comparable opportunities\\" through the Joint Declaration that was signed. As a result, combined efforts started to be made for rejecting protectionism, removing market barriers, implementing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and OECD principles concerning trade and investment. In addition, were set the basis for an intensive interaction and co-operation in areas such as trade, investment, industrial co-operation, advanced technology, energy, employment, social affairs and competition rules. In the light of this diplomatic development, EU Gateway programme gained support and build a solid reputation both on the European and Japanese markets. The democratic and economic drive of the Korean society started in 1992 after the election of Kim Young-sam, the first South Korean President with a civilian background. In 1995, European Union launched the negotiations for a Framework Agreement (FA) on Trade and Cooperation with the Republic of South Korea. In April 2001, the Framework Agreement entered into force committing both parties to foster bilateral trade and investment. In 2007, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations between EU and South Korea started, entering into force in July 2011. The EU Gateway programme to South Korea was launched during the FTA consultations aiming to accompany the implementation of the agreement along the way. Since the initial launch of the programme, over 30 business missions were organised by the EU Gateway initiative with more than 3000 European SMEs participants. From 2002 ‚Äì 2007, the programme reduced its sectorial focus from 10 to 7, organising 30 business missions with close to 1000 participating companies. 2008 marked a new era in EU Gateway history as the programme was launched in another country, South Korea. All in all, from 2008 ‚Äì 2014 more than 1500 companies participated in 31 business missions to Japan and 15 business missions to South Korea respectively.  EU Gateway as an instrument to foster bilateral trade relations  = EU ‚Äì Japan Trade Relations = Over the past decades the EU and Japan have developed strong economic ties and Japan, the world's third largest economy, is the EU's 7th largest trading partner. Trade between the two partners is expected to increase by a prospective EPA for which the negotiations were launched during the EU-Japan summit in March 2013. Both parties aim to conclude a comprehensive agreement for goods, services and investment, eliminating tariffs, non-tariff barriers and covering other trade-related issues, such as public procurement. The Free Trade Agreement is expected to increase the EU's GDP by 0.6 to 0.8% and EU export to Japan by more than 32.7%. Despite the joint efforts made to foster economic co-operation, SMEs are still encountering challenges when entering the Japanese market: * High business costs related to: taxes, salaries, purchasing or renting office, social security; * Legal restrictions and rigid/complicated administrative procedures required for business permits and licenses; * Lack of mobility in the labour market leading to difficulties in finding human resources; * Specificities of the Japanese market and difficulty in communicating in foreign languages. = EU ‚Äì South Korea Trade Relations = alt=EU Gateway thumb Business Avenues is an initiative funded by the European Union helping European companies to establish long-lasting business collaborations in Asia. Selected European companies get the opportunity to participate in a one-week business mission in any of the three target markets, Korea, South East Asia and China, and soon Japan. The programme is focused on specific sectors, with an emphasis on green and clean technology and services. South Korea is the EU's 8th largest trading partner and EU has become South Korea's second largest trading partner and export destination. In 2011 ‚Äì 2012, South Korea was one of EU's main trading partners registering 16.2% exports' growth rate. The EU ‚Äì Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which is applied since 1 July 2011, has marked an unprecedented step forward in trade relations between the EU and the Republic of Korea. The agreement eliminated tariffs for industrial and agricultural goods in a progressive, step-by-step approach, and on 1 July 2016, import duties will be eliminated on all products except for a limited number of agricultural products. The FTA also contains a number of specific commitments to eliminate and to prevent the emergence of non-tariff barriers to trade, notably in the automotive, pharmaceutical and electronic sectors. With the FTA, the bilateral trade in goods between the EU and the Republic of Korea has been constantly growing and reached the record level of more than 90 billion euros in 2015, with an increment of the EU export of 10.9% over 2014.The EU is also the largest investor in the country, ahead of the United States and Japan. The EU FDI stock in the Republic of Korea increased 35% from 2013 to 2014 (last data available) to reach 43.7 billion euros, accounting for over 20% of the FDI stock in the Republic of Korea. For the third year, South Korea ranked first among all nations in the Global Innovation Index (Bloomberg), and second in High Tech density, which make the country an attractive business destination for European business, including SMEs, specialising in high technologies It is estimated that just 9 months after the first tariff cuts took effect, EU companies exporting their products to Korea already made cash savings of ‚Ç¨350 million in duties. Being recognised as one of the fastest growing hi-tech economies in the world, South Korea is an attractive business destination for European SMEs specialising in high technologies. Although significant progress has been made for overcoming market barriers, European companies are still facing challenges when acceding to the Korean market: * Pricing and Marketing Arrangements; * Standards and other technical requirements; * Import licensing; * Documentation and customs procedure; * Complex distribution system. = EU ‚Äì South East Asia Trade Relations = Following the identification of South East Asia as a priority region in 2006, the EU has been actively engaged with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with ASEAN were launched in 2007 and paused in 2009 to give way to a bilateral format of negotiation. The European Commission finalised the negotiation of a bilateral FTA with Singapore in October 2014 and with Vietnam in December 2015. ASEAN is the EU's 3rd largest trading partner outside Europe (after the US and China) with more than ‚Ç¨238 billion of trade in goods and services in 2014. EU-ASEAN trade in goods grew by 4.4% from 2013‚Äì2014 while bilateral trade in services increased by 6.5% over the same time (in value terms). The EU is by far the largest investor in ASEAN countries. EU companies have invested an average ‚Ç¨14.8 billion annually in the region (2006‚Äì2013) with over ‚Ç¨150 billion in FDI stock held in the region at the end of 2013. Specific initiatives and instruments such as the EU Gateway  Business Avenues in South East Asia seek to facilitate business opportunities for European SMEs, boosting trade, investment and business ties with a region of over 600 million consumers. = EU ‚Äì China Trade Relations = China is the second largest trading partner of the EU, and the EU is China's largest trading partner. Most of this trade is in industrial and manufactured goods, with an expanding services component. The bilateral trade relations between China and the EU continues to grow. Both parties are members of the WTO, and share several plurilateral agreements. China is currently negotiating with the members that are part of the Government Procurement Agreement, including the EC, which will open China's lucrative procurement market to European companies and vice versa. Furthermore, given China's slow shift into a consumer-oriented economy and the EU's strength in the service and high-quality consumer goods industries, there will be many market opportunities in China in the future for discerning EU companies. Some of the industries and sectors which could become important for EU companies in China include: *Medical services and equipment *Elder care *Green buildings and green energy technologies *Education and childcare services = How EU Gateway  Business Avenues helps European companies in Asia = * One week business missions to Asian target markets for European companies in the following sectors: Environment & Water Technologies, Green Energy Technologies, Construction & Building Technologies, Healthcare & Medical Technologies, Information & Communication Technologies, Contemporary European Design, Food & Beverage, Services: * Two exhibition days (in the framework of the business week); * Arranging individual business meetings between European companies and Asian business representatives; * Customized business services; * Advice on certifications and legal matters to be dealt with in Asian target markets; * Company branding and promotion; * Logistical and operational support (prior to, as well as during the business mission week).  Main Achievements and results  In 2014, the EU Gateway programme reached 20 years of history in Japan and 6 years of presence in Korea. In this timespan, over 3750 European SMEs participated in 163 business missions successfully entering the Japanese or the Korean market. During the programme phase (2008 -2014), EU Gateway organised successfully 31 business missions to Japan and 15 business missions to Korea. Furthermore, from 2008 to 2014, about 1500 European SMEs from 28 EU Member States joined the programme with 94% of participants eager to enroll again. Engaged in the business support path, EU Gateway created long lasting business ties with Korean and Japanese representatives. In 2009, 51% of participants reported newly established business collaborations, a number which by 2014 increased to 82%. Programme results in financial terms are high, 97% of participants reported significant increase in their sales distribution figures. In addition, over 40% of EU Gateway's attendees experienced revenue growth following the sector-related business missions.

The first single \\"Open Road\\" has a music video directed by Christine Davis (Christian Mistress vocalist) and Marit Schmidt. Musical style The band's musical style has been associated with the new wave of British heavy metal movement. According to Pitchfork Media writer Grayson Currin, the band's second album, Possession, combined influences from \\"proto- thrash, grandiose classic rock, and smoky doom.\\" The band was compared to British heavy metal acts Diamond Head and early Iron Maiden. The vocals of Christine Davis were also described as a \\"combination of the incantatory power of Patti Smith, the raw force of Wendy O. Williams, and the howls of Nicole Lee of '80s Chicago thrashers Znowhite.\\" Her vocals in Possession were also compared to various singers which were also described to be her favourite, including Diamanda Gal√°s, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Michael Gira of Swans, Mariska Veres of Shocking Blue, and Roky Erickson of The 13th Floor Elevators.

CCBR engages in a wide range of activities, including apologetics training, leafletting, interviews, debates and public demonstrations in campuses, schools, churches and streets throughout North America, and occasionally in Europe.http://www.refdag.nl/nieuws/buitenland/canadees_nederlands_echtpaar_strijdt_al_jaren_tegen_abortus_1_736917 History Stephanie Gray and Jojo Ruba co-founded CCBR in 2001. The organization modeled itself after the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform (CBR), founded in 1993 in Lake Forest, California. The president of CCBR is Nick Rosendal.  Activities  = Abortion Awareness Project = The CCBR organizes the Genocide Awareness Projec on college campuses, using graphic images to target MPs who support abortion rights. Describing the campaign in 2013, Gray said \\"We have put together an 18-year plan called 'End the Killing,' and we aim to saturate the Canadian culture with the facts about who the baby is and what abortion does to the baby...so that we can eradicate abortion from our culture.\\" The display contains graphic images of abortion, mass graves, and public lynchings while comparing abortion to the Holocaust and other forms of genocide. = \\"Choice\\" Chain = The CCBR's \\"Choice\\" Chain project involves display handheld signs which depict the violence of abortion and aborted fetuses on city streets, college campuses, or outside high schools. The group has also hung banners with similar graphic images from highway overpasses in Hamilton, Ontario.How anti-abortion protesters use a loophole to hang banners over the Linc, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 18 October 2013 Writing in Maclean's, Robyn Urback said the group's decision to hold demonstrations outside high schools \\"pushes the ethics of public pandering\\" and that \\"holding up a poster of a bloody fetus provides none of the context, and little of the tact required when dealing with sensitive teens.\\"Graphic anti-abortion displays have no place near schools, Robyn Urback, Maclean's, 13 June 2011 In 2013, the National Post reported that Gray said her group's position may be labeled as \\"extreme\\" from a mainstream perspective but that \\"If rejecting a culture of killing children is extreme, I'm OK with that\\", comparing her view to that of Martin Luther King Jr. in his \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\", where he responded to criticisms of his tactics as \\"extreme\\". She defended the group's tactic of using graphic images as being essential to the pro-life movement in exposing the nature of abortion. = Face the Children = In 2012, a motion in the Parliament of Canada to review the legality of abortion in Canada, failed 203-91. In a campaign called \\"Face the Children\\",Pro-life group delivers graphic abortion cards to 50,000 Hamilton homes, The Spec, April 2, 2014 the Centre is targeting several opponents of the motion, specifically the Calgary ridings of MP Michelle Rempel and Prime Minister Stephen Harper, by distributing tens of thousands of pamphlets containing what the National Post called \\"gruesome images\\" of abortion. = Calgary Airport protest case = Several members of the group were arrested for trespassing at Calgary International Airport during a protest in 2011, but were acquitted in a 2013 bench trial, as the judge said their actions were protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.‚ÄòFree expression rights‚Äô upheld as judge acquits anti-abortion protesters, Daryl Slade, Calgary Herald, 15 July 2013  The Trudeau Flyer Campaign  In late Q1 of 2015 the Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform distributed a graphic flyer campaign which paired photos of aborted fetuses with leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau. The aim was explained to graphically show images of a bloodied aborted fetus killed by abortion next to Justin Trudeau to a million homes nationwide in a bid to sway the fall election. The mail campaign started in late March in Vancouver and reached Toronto by May 2015. Thereafter the great Toronto area was targeted - including areas of Mississauga and Etobicoke South.http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/i-hope-they- are-horrified-graphic-postcard-campaign-pairs-photos-of-aborted-fetus-with- justin-trudeau The campaign failed in their attempt to sway the election, as Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada won, and went on to form a Majority Government. In response to outrage to the campaign, Jonathon Van Maren, spokesperson for the group said: \\"Frankly, I hope (people) are shocked. I hope they are horrified. What our pictures do is show that while choice is obviously a precious liberty, some choices are wrong.\\"  References  External links * Category:Anti-abortion organizations in Canada Category:Conservatism in Canada Category:Non-profit organizations based in Alberta Category:Organizations based in Calgary Category:Organizations established in 2001 ","title":"Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform"},{"id":"42425590","title":"Locarno‚ÄìMadonna del Sasso funicular"},{"id":"42425629","text":"Aspietes (, from aspet, \\"rider, knight\\"), feminine form Aspietina (·ºàœÉœÄŒπŒµœÑŒØŒΩŒ±) or Aspietissa (·ºàœÉœÄŒπŒ≠œÑŒπœÉœÉŒ±), was the surname of a Byzantine noble family of Armenian origin active in the 12th‚Äì15th centuries. Despite the mention of a \\"great and numerous lineage of the so-called Aspetianoi\\" by the 6th-century Byzantine historian Procopius of Caesarea, the later Aspietai seem to be entirely unrelated to them. The later Byzantine writers ascribed the Aspietai descent from the Arsacid royal dynasty, but Alexandra Wassiliou-Seibt points out that this was a common literary topos at the time, and that \\"almost all representatives of the senior Armenian nobility [..] were regarded as descendants of the Arsacids\\". The first known member of the Aspietai family was a general of Alexios I Komnenos, active in the early 12th century. Beginning with the 17th-century scholar Du Cange, successive historians, including Ferdinand Chalandon, Steven Runciman, and Konstantinos Varzos, have identified him with Oshin of Lampron. In 1924, however, Joseph Laurent rejected this identification, and has been followed by some modern scholars since. Most of the known members of the family served as military commanders: apart from the original Aspietes/Oshin, another member of the family fought and was killed at the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1081, Michael Aspietes was a general under Manuel I Komnenos, Constantine Aspietes served under both Manuel I and Isaac II Angelos, Alexios Aspietes served as commander of Serres in 1195 and was proclaimed emperor in 1204, while a member of the family headed an embassy to Saladin in 1189. The family is still extensively attested in the Palaiologan period, where it still belonged to the landed nobility and intermarried with other noble houses, but none of its members managed to rise to senior offices.

Caught amidst labor revolts & naxal uprisings, the last thing Saryu Bhan Singh wanted was to make enemies with the top government officer of his region. He sends his most lethal human weapon, Karua (Vipinno) to scare Nisheeth Kumar off to silence. But the mission don't-kill-just-scare-him goes horribly wrong when Karua ends up injuring Nisheeth's wife and in the process of escape, ends up carrying Nisheeth's infant also, thus abducting the child.

It was named by Matthew Flinders in memory of William Smith who was one of the eight crew lost from a cutter that capsized sometime after being launched from HM Sloop Investigator to search for water on 21 February 1802. Since 2004, the island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Description Smith Island is approximately south-east of Port Lincoln, south of Lewis Island and east of Cape Catastrophe. The island has an area of and a maximum height of above sea level. Access to the island is limited by the absence of a coastline sheltered from swells and tidal streams. Formation, geology and oceanography Smith Island was formed about 9100 years ago when sea levels rose at the start of the Holocene. The island consists of a granite outcrop rising from the seabed to a flat-topped capping of calcarenite which is covered by ‚Äòan unusually thick blanket of soil, thinning only to outcropping calcrete‚Äô at the perimeter of the capping. Below the water's surface, the island rises from a depth of within only of its west, south and east shorelines. Flora and fauna = Flora= As of 1996, a total of 23 species have been identified. Most of this diversity is confined to the thinner soils at the perimeter of the calcarenite capping. The deeper soil was occupied by marsh saltbush with the deepest soils supporting grey saltbush. = Fauna= Australian sea lions were plentiful on Smith Island in 1936. Short-tailed shearwaters and white-faced storm petrels nest in burrows excavated within the soil on the island's calcarenite cap. In 1996, the presence of a breeding colony of flesh-footed shearwaters. was discovered on the island. As of 2013, the island is reported as having 150 breeding pairs of flesh-footed shearwaters. History The island was one of several first sighted by Europeans on Saturday, 20 February 1802, from HMS Investigator whilst under the command of Matthew Flinders entered what is now Spencer Gulf. Flinders named the island on Wednesday, 24 February 1802, in memory of William Smith who lost his life, presumably drowned, along with seven other members of the crew on Sunday 21 February 1802 when one of HMS Investigator‚Äôs cutters capsized near Cape Catastrophe. Economic activity = Gauno= Smith Island is one of the island sites from which guano was mined under licence from the South Australian Government prior to 1919. Protected areas status Since 30 September 2004, Smith Island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Previously, it had been part of the Lincoln National Park. It originally obtained protected area status as a fauna reserve under the former Fauna Conservation Act 1964 in 1965 followed by status as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967.

Much of the territory on the Azov Sea north to Sviatohirsk and Sloviansk near the border with Kharkiv Oblast was brought under control of the Government of Ukraine in the early July 2014 post-ceasefire government offensive and the area under the control of the rebels was mainly reduced to Donetsk city.

Although the rebels do not have control of most of Donetsk Oblast, this number is relatively high since the DPR has been controlling major urban areas and cities such as Donetsk and Horlivka. As of 17 June 2015, it is estimated that around half of the people living in separatist controlled territory are retired pensioners. In November 2019 separatist parliament passed a law on state border, whereby theoretically laid claim to entire Donetsk Oblast, but also stipulated that \\"pending conflict resolution\\" the self-proclaimed polity's border will run along line of engagement instead. According to a 2001 census, ethnic Ukrainians make up 56.9% of the total population of Donbass as a whole with ethnic Russians making up the largest minority, making up 38.2% of the total population of Donbass. Russian is the main language in Donbass as 74.9% of the population of Donbass speaks Russian as their main language.

The majority of the population speaks Russian as their first language. Attempts by various Ukrainian governments to question the legitimacy of the Russian culture in Ukraine had since the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine often resulted in political conflict. In the Ukrainian national elections, a remarkably stable pattern had developed, where Donbass and the Western Ukrainian regions had voted for the opposite candidates since the presidential election in 1994. Viktor Yanukovych, a Donetsk native, had been elected as a president of Ukraine in 2010. Eastern Ukrainian dissatisfaction with the government can also be attributed to the Euromaidan Protests which began in November 2013. President Yanukovych's overthrow in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution led to protests in Eastern Ukraine, which gradually escalated into an armed conflict between the newly formed Ukrainian government and the local armed militias.Petro, Nicolai N., Understanding the Other Ukraine: Identity and Allegiance in Russophone Ukraine (1 March 2015).

The separatists demanded that if an extraordinary session was not held by officials, announcing a referendum to join Russia, they would declare unilateral control by forming a \\"People's Mandate\\" at noon on 7 April, and dismiss all elected council members and MPs. When the session was not held they held a vote within the RSA and were not elected to the positions they assumed. According to the Russian ITAR-TASS the declaration was voted by some regional legislators; however, there are claims that neither the Donetsk city council nor district councils of the city delegated any representatives to the session. The political leadership initially consisted of Denis Pushilin, self-appointed as chairman of the government, while Igor Kakidzyanov was named as the commander of the \\"People's Army\\". Vyacheslav Ponomarev became known as the self-proclaimed mayor of the city of Sloviansk.\\"Pro-Russian mayor of Slavyansk sacked and arrested\\". The Guardian. 12 June 2014. Ukrainian-born pro-Russian activist Pavel Gubarev, an Anti-Maidan activist, a former member of the neo-Nazi Russian National Unity paramilitary group in 1999-2001 and former member of the left-wing populist Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, proclaimed himself the \\"People's Governor\\" of the Donetsk Region. He was arrested on charges of separatism and illegal seizure of power but released in a hostage swap.Digital Journal, Pro- Russian Gubarev, a symbol of east Ukraine separatism, by Germain Moyon, 9 March 2014. Alexander Borodai, a Russian citizen claiming to be involved in the Russian annexation of Crimea, was appointed as Prime Minister. On 6 April, the group's leaders announced that a referendum, on whether Donetsk Oblast should \\"join the Russian Federation\\", would take place \\"no later than May 11th, 2014.\\" Additionally, the group's leaders appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to send Russian peacekeeping forces to the region. On the morning of 8 April, the 'Patriotic Forces of Donbass', a pro-Kyiv group that was formed on 15 March earlier that year by 13 pro-Kyiv NGOs, political parties and individuals, unrelated to Donetsk Republic organisation who proclaimed independence and seized the council, issued a statement on its Facebook page, \\"cancelling\\" the other group's declaration of independence, citing complaints from locals, a move that was generally interpreted by Ukrainian media as coming from the pro-Russian party. Their announcement stated that they would quash the potential state's establishment, cancel the referendum, and, on their part, stated that the declaration is illegal and some rebels reportedly gave up weapons as well. Despite this, the Donetsk Republic organisation continued to occupy the RSA and declared themselves the legitimate authority, and upheld all previous calls for a referendum and the release of their leader Pavel Gubarev. In the afternoon of 8 April, about a thousand people rallied in front of the RSA listening to speeches about the Donetsk People's Republic and to Soviet and Russian music. People carrying the DPR flag in Donetsk, 9 May 2014 According to an article from the Kyiv Post on 10 April, most of the protesters were aged 50 or older, while inside the RSA building, many of the occupiers are younger but from other cities such as Mariupol, Kherson and Mykolaiv. The occupiers included both men and women. According to \\"Novosti Donbassa\\", unstated number of Russian citizens, including one leader of a far-right militant group, had also taken part in the events. The OSCE reported that all the main institutions of the city observed by the Monitoring Team seemed to be working normally as of 16 April. On 22 April, separatists agreed to release the session hall of the building along with two floors to state officials. The 9th and 10th floors were later released on 24 April. On the second day of the Republic, organisers decided to pour all of their alcohol out and announce a prohibition law after issues arose due to excess drinking in the building. A line to enter a polling place in Donetsk city, 11 May On 30 April, Donetsk Republic chairman Pushilin flew to Moscow and held a press conference. On 7 May, Russian president Vladimir Putin publicly asked pro-Russian separatists to postpone the proposed referendum in order to create the necessary conditions for dialogue. Despite Putin's comments, pro-Russia militants calling themselves the Donetsk People's Republic said they would still carry out the referendum. The same day, Ukraine's security service (SBU) released an alleged audio recording of a phone call between a Donetsk separatist leader and leader of one of the splinter groups of former Russian National Unity Alexander Barkashov. Barkashov's following is believed to be in sharp decline since the beginning of the 2000s (decade). In the call, the voice said to be Barkashov insists on falsifying the results of the referendum, that he had communicated with Putin, and that it cannot be postponed. Yuri Vendik of the BBC noted that a 5 May post on Barkashov's social media page recounted a phone call from \\"our brothers and comrades-in-arms in Donetsk\\" that sounds exactly like the SBU intercept. Barkashov later confirmed that he was in Donetsk during the alleged taping, and has stated that his group was organising volunteer troops to fight \\"the vicious Kiev junta.\\" SBU stated that this tape is a definitive proof of the direct involvement of Russian government with preparations for the referendum. Ukrainian authorities released separatist leader Pavel Gubarev and two others in exchange for three people detained by the Donetsk Republic. The DPR has cultivated relations with European far-right and nationalist politicians and writers, including French far-right MEP Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, Italian nationalist Alessandro Musolino, German neo-Nazi journalist Manuel Ochsenreiter, and Emmanuel Leroy, a far-right adviser to Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front. The DPR also gets support from western European left wing and communist parties. An antifascist solidarity movement, \\"Bristol Ukraine Anti Fascist Solidarity\\", was created in the UK which gives support to the DPR, as well as in Spain, Germany, Sweden and Italy there has been open support for the DPR in some communist groups and parties. In these countries, several demonstrations and protests has been held by anti-fascists to show support for Donbass. In Sweden, the pro-separatist movement \\"Donbassf√∂reningen\\" was created by, among others, veterans from several communist parties. The DPR international militia volunteers from Flags of the Donetsk Republic and Russia in Donetsk, 8 March 2014western Europe are mostly Spanish and Italian communists but also groups of Israeli feminists whose open statement is to \\"fight fascism\\" has also travelled to the DPR and joined the militia groups.Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (October 2014)On 15 April 2014, acting President Olexander Turchynov announced the start of a military counteroffensive to confront the pro-Russian militants, and on 17 April, tensions de-escalated as Russia, the US, and the EU agreed on a roadmap to eventually end the crisis. However, officials of the People's Republic ignored the agreement and vowed to continue their occupations until a referendum is accepted or the government in Kyiv resigns. Following the agreement, the Security Service of Ukraine continued to detain Russians entering the country with large amounts of money and military gear. In July 2014, Denis Pushilin, the chairman of the republic, said that he did not envision the Donetsk People's Republic becoming an independent state, instead preferring to join a renewed Russian Empire. = 11 May independence referendum = On 7 May, separatist rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk said that they would proceed with the referendum that was scheduled to be held 11 May, disregarding Vladimir Putin's appeal to delay it. \\"The referendum will take place as planned. The ballots have been already arrived at the polling stations,\\" said Vasily Nikitin, from the press service which is organising the referendum in Luhansk. The referendum was held on 11 may and the organisers claimed that 89% voted in favor of self-rule, with 10% against, on a turnout of nearly 75%. The results of the referendums were not officially recognised by any government, including those of Ukraine, the United States, the countries of the European Union, and Russia. Germany and the United States stated that the referendums had \\"no democratic legitimacy\\", while the Russian government expressed \\"respect\\" for the results and urged a \\"civilised\\" implementation. On the day after the referendum, the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic proclaimed Donetsk to be a sovereign state with an indefinite border and \\"ask[ed] Russia to consider the issue of our republic's accession into the Russian Federation\\". It also announced that it would not participate in the presidential election which took place on 25 May. In response, \\"the Kremlin called for dialogue between the government in Kiev and the south-east regions of the country, suggesting that a Crimea-style annexation of the region for Moscow is not on the cards.\\" = Peace proposals and stalemate= On 1 September 2014, DPR rebels announced that they would respect Ukraine's sovereignty in exchange for autonomy. But they withdrew this offer a few days later. Truce in Ukraine violated, but holding for now, Special Broadcasting Service (8 September 2014) On 12 February 2015, the DPR and LPR leaders, Alexander Zakharchenko and Igor Plotnitsky, signed the Minsk II agreement. In the Minsk agreement it is agreed to introduce amendments to the Ukrainian constitution \\"the key element of which is decentralisation\\" and the holding of elections \\"On temporary Order of Local Self-Governance in Particular Districts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, based in the line set up by the Minsk Memorandum as of 19 September 2014\\"; in return rebel held territory would be reintegrated into Ukraine. Representatives of the DPR and LPR continue to forward their proposals concerning Minsk II to the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine. In an effort to stabilize the ceasefire in the region, particularly the disputed and strategically important town of Debaltseve, in February 2015 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called for a UN-led peacekeeping operation to monitor the compliance with the agreement achieved during the Minsk peace talks. On 20 May 2015, the leadership of the Federal State of Novorossiya announced the termination of the confederation 'project'. On 15 June 2015, DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said, \\"Whatever happens in Minsk, DPR is an independent state and will never be a part of Ukraine\\". On 31 August 2015, the Verkhovna Rada read the amendments in the Ukrainian construction required by Minsk II for the first time with 265 deputies voting for the amendments. But since then, it has not voted for the required second reading needed to implement the change in constitution. Passage of the amendment in this second reading requires an extended majority of 300 of the Rada's 450 seats, something that The New York Times has described as \\"all-but- impossible\\" (since all nationalist parties would vote against the amendments). In March 2016, the DPR began to issue passports despite a 2015 statement by Zakharchenko that, without at least partial recognition of DPR, local passports would be a \\"waste of resources\\". In November 2016 the DPR announced that all of its citizens had dual Ukrainian/Donetsk People's Republic citizenship. On 31 August 2018 DPR leader Zakharchenko was killed by a bomb in a restaurant in Donetsk. On 16 October 2016 prominent Russian (citizen) and DPR military leader Arsen Pavlov had been killed by an IED explosion in his Donetsk apartment's elevator. (17 October 2016) (Another) well known DPR military commander Mikhail Tolstykh was killed by an explosion while working in his Donetsk office on 8 February 2017. Despite the War in Donbass not ceasing, the leadership of the DPR and LPR stated in 2019 that they wish to reintegrate the territories they control into Ukraine.Donbas: The new repertoire, The Ukrainian Week (28 September 2019) Since December 2019 Ukrainian passports are no longer considered a valid identifying document in the DPR and Ukrainian license plates were also declared illegal.The march of dis-integration, The Ukrainian Week (7 March 2020) Meanwhile the previous favorable view of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the DPR press was replaced by with personal accusations of ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù and ‚Äúcrimes against Donbas,‚Äù and proposals of organizing a tribunal against him in absentia. In March 2020 Russian was declared to be the only state language of the DPR. In its May 2014 constitution DPR had declared Russian and Ukrainian its official languages. = Regional public opinion = In a poll conducted by Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in the first half of February 2014, 33.2% of people polled in Donetsk Oblast believed \\"Ukraine and Russia must unite into a single state\\". According to a poll conducted by the Institute of Social Research and Policy Analysis, 66% of Donetsk residents viewed their future in a united Ukraine, 4.7% supported separatism, 18.2% supported joining Russia, while 31.6% wanted a united Ukraine with expansion of autonomy for Donetsk region, with only 18.6% in support of the current status A second poll conducted 26‚Äì29 March 2014 showed that 77% of residents condemned the takeover of administrative buildings, while 16% supported such actions. Furthermore, 40.8% of Donetsk citizens support rallies for Ukraine's unity, while 26.5% support rallies which are pro-Russia. While support for regional independence was low, only a third of polled Donetsk inhabitants identified themselves as \\"citizens of Ukraine\\", preferring instead \\"Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine\\" or \\"residents of Donbass\\". The New York Times stated on 11 April 2014 that many locals consider the newly formed republic a \\"crackpot project\\". The Kyiv International Institute of Sociology released a second study with polling data taken from 8‚Äì16 April 2014. 18.1% of Donetsk Oblast residents supported the recent armed seizures of administrative buildings in the region, while 72% disapproved of the current actions. Roughly 25% in the Donbas region said they would attend secessionist rallies in favor of joining Russia. Most in Donetsk believed that the disarmament and disbanding of illegal radical groups was crucial to preserving national unity. 12.4% were in favor of Ukraine and Russia uniting into a single state; 27.5% in Donetsk were in favor of regional secession from Ukraine to join Russia, 38.4% support federalisation, 41.1% supported a unitary Ukraine with decentralisation of power and broadening of rights of regions, and 10.6% supported the current unitary state. On 15 June 2015, several hundred people protested in the center of Donetsk. The protesters, mostly from the Oktyabrskiy region of the town, called on the military command to remove \\"Grad\\" launchers from this residential area; such launchers have been used to fire at Ukrainian positions, provoking return fire and causing civilian casualties. A DPR leader said that its forces were indeed shelling from residential areas (mentioning school 41 specifically), but that \\"the punishment of the enemy is everyone's shared responsibility\\". In a poll conducted in August 2015, with 6500 respondents from 19 cities of the Donetsk Oblast, only 29% supported the DPR and 10% considered themselves to be \\"Russian patriots\\". Political status All UN member states consider the Republic a legal part of Ukraine. Only South Ossetia, which is also a state with limited recognition internationally recognised as part of Georgia, has recognised the Donetsk People's Republic as a sovereign entity after it declared independence from Ukraine in 2014 with Donetsk as its declared capital.Ukraine‚Äôs rebel ‚Äòpeople‚Äôs republics‚Äô begin work of building new states, The Guardian (6 November 2014) The parliaments of both entities signed a memorandum on cooperation on 10 April 2016.

The first full Government of the Donetsk People's Republic was appointed on 16 May 2014. It consisted of several ministers who were previously Donetsk functionaries, a member of the Makiivka City Council, a former Donetsk prosecutor, a former member of the special police Alpha Group, a member of the Party of Regions (who allegedly coordinated \\"Titushky\\" (Viktor Yanukovych supporters) during Euromaidan) and Russian citizens. The system of government is described by its deputy defence minister Fyodor Berezin as aiming to build as military communism. Administration proper in DPR territories is performed by those authorities which performed these functions prior to the War in Donbass. The DPR leadership has also appointed mayors. On 4 September 2015, there was a sudden change in the DPR government, where Denis Pushilin replaced Andrey Purgin in the role of speaker of People's Council and in his first decision, fired Aleksey Aleksandrov, the council's chief of staff, Purgin's close ally. This happened in absence of Purgin and Aleksandrov who were held at the border between Russia and DPR, preventing their return to the republic. Aleksandrov was accused of \\"destructive activities\\" and \\"attempt to illegally cross the border\\" by the republic's Ministry of Public Security. Russian and Ukrainian media commented on these events as of yet another coup in the republic's authorities. On 31 August 2018, Head and Prime Minister Alexander Zakharchenko was killed in an explosion in a cafe in Donetsk. After his death Dmitry Trapeznikov was appointed as head of the government until September 2019 when he was nominated mayor of Elista, capital of Kalmyk Republic in Russia. On 5 February 2020 Denis Pushilin unexpectedly appointed Vladimir Pashkov, a Russian citizen and former deputy governor of Russia‚Äôs Irkutsk Oblast, as the \\"chairman of the government\\".

Economy The Donetsk People's Republic has a mixed economy. Following a large scale privatisation process in the late 90s, most of the companies in the Donetsk People's Republic are now privately owned. The economy is based on a mix of heavy industry (steel production), electricity production, and manufacturing (textile production), which together account for about 80% of the total industrial output. The Donetsk People's Republic has its own central bank, the Donetsk Republican Bank. The Republic's economy is frequently described as dependent on contraband and gunrunning, with some labelling it a mafia state. Joining DPR military formations or its civil services has become one of the few guarantees for a stable income in the DPR. By late October 2014 many banks and other businesses in the Donetsk People's Republic were shut and people were often left without social benefits payments. Sources (who declined to be identified, citing security concerns) inside the DPR administration have told Bloomberg News that Russia transfers 2.5 billion Russian rubles ($37 million) for pensions every month.The Central Bank With No Currency, No Interest Rates, But ATMs, Bloomberg News (16 16 September 2015) By mid-February 2016 Russia had sent 48 humanitarian convoys to rebel held territory that was said to have delivered more than 58,000 tons of cargo; including food, medicines, construction materials, diesel generators and fuel and lubricants.Official: Moscow will return control over eastern border to Kiev after crisis is settled, Russian News Agency TASS (15 February 2016) President Poroshenko called this a \\"flagrant violation of international law\\" and Valentyn Nalyvaychenko said it was a \\"direct invasion\\".

By June 2015, due to logistical and transport problems, prices in DPR-controlled territory are significantly higher than in territory controlled by Ukraine. This led to an increase of supplies (of more expensive products and those of lower quality) from Russia. Mines and heavy-industry facilities damaged by shelling were forced to close, undermining the wider chain of economic ties in the region. Three industrial facilities were under Donetsk People's Republic \\"temporary management\\" by late October 2014. By early June 2015, 80% of companies that were physically located in the Donetsk People's Republic had been re-registered on territory under Ukrainian control. A Donetsk People's Republic official often promised financial support from Russia, without giving specific details. Prime Minister Aleksandr Zakharchenko in late October 2014 stated that \\"We have the Russian Federation's agreement in principle on granting us special conditions on gas (deliveries)\\". Zakharchenko also claimed that \\"And, finally, we managed to link up with the financial and banking structure of the Russian Federation\\". When Reuters tried to get more details from a source close to Zakharchenko its only reply was \\"Money likes silence\\". Early October 2014 Zakharchenko had stated \\"The economy will be completely, if possible, oriented towards the Russian market. We consider Russia our strategic partner\\", according to Zakharchenko this would \\"secure our economy from impacts from outside, including from Ukraine\\".Donetsk Republic PM speaks in favour of economic cooperation with Russia, ITAR-TASS (12 October 2014) According to Yury Makohon, from the Ukrainian National Institute for Strategic Studies, \\"Trade volume between Russia and Donetsk Oblast has seen a massive slump since the beginning of 2014\\". Since Russia does not recognise the legal status of the self-proclaimed republic all the trade it does with it is on the basis of Ukrainian law. DPR authorities have created a multi-currency zone in which both the rouble (Russia's currency) and the hryvnia (Ukraine's currency) can be used, and also the Euro and U.S. Dollar. Cash shortages are widespread and, due to a lack of roubles, the hryvnia is the most-used currency. According to Ukraine's security services in May 2016 alone the Russian government has passed 19 million USD in cash to fund the DPR administration as well as 35,000 blank Russian passports. Since late February 2015, the DPR- controlled territory received its natural gas directly from Russia, which is opposed by Ukraine. According to Russia, Ukraine should pay for these deliveries while Ukraine claims it does not receive payments for the supplies from the DPR-controlled territory.Russian gas for the Donbas: the games being played with Kyiv and Brussels, Centre for Eastern Studies (25 February 2015) On 2 July 2015, Ukrainian Energy Minister Volodymyr Demchyshyn announced that he \\"did not expect\\" that Ukraine would supply natural gas to territory controlled by separatist troops in the 2015‚Äì2016 heating season. Since 25 November 2015 Ukraine has halted all its imports of (and payments for) natural gas from Russia.Ukraine closes airspace to all Russian planes, BBC News (25 November 2015) Donetsk People's Republic is setting up its own mobile network operator called Feniks, to be fully operational at the end of the summer of 2015. According to Kyivstar Feniks illegally uses equipment that they officially gave up in territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists on 5 February 2015. Prime Minister Zakharchenko on 18 April 2015 issued a decree stating that all equipment that Kyivstar gave up falls under the control of the separatists in order to \\"meet the needs of the population in the communication services\\".Kremlin-separatist area gets its own mobile operator, Kyiv Post (5 June 2015) Kyivstar switches off mobile network in militant-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk region, Interfax-Ukraine (5 February 2015) The Sim cards of Feniks display the slogan \\"Connection for the victory\\". In June 2015 the DPR authorities announced start of military pension payments in US dollars. Mid- March 2017 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko signed a decree on a temporary ban on the movement of goods to and from territory controlled by the self- proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic; this also means that since then Ukraine does not buy coal from the Donets Black Coal Basin.Ukrainian energy industry: thorny road of reform, UNIAN (10 January 2018) Anthracite mines under DPR control are reportedly supplying coal to Poland through Russian shell companies to disguise its real origin. According to Ukrainian and Russian media the coal export company Vneshtorgservis owned by Serhiy Kurchenko owes massive debts to (located in separatist controlled territory) coal mines and other local companies.The age of marauders, The Ukrainian Week (2 February 2020) Sergey Zdrilyuk (\\"Abwehr\\"), former deputy of DNR militia, stated in an interview in 2020 that large scale disassembly of mining equipment for scrap metal and other forms of looting took place routinely during Igor Girkin's time as militia commander, and that Girkin took significant amounts of money with him to Moscow. Militia groups such as \\"Vostok\\" and \\"Oplot\\" as well as various \\"Cossack formations\\" were involved in looting on systematic basis. The Donetsk News Agency reported in August that the DPR exported some 19 billion rubles ($256 mln) worth of industrial goods in the first half of 2020. The Donetsk News Agency reported that the DPR exported machinery, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, construction materials, nonmetallic minerals, dairy, meat, and sausage products to Russia, Luhansk People's Republic, Kazakhstan, Poland, Belarus and Latvia. (Note: Wikipedia advises that information from Donetsk News Agency is prohibited on Wikipedia so this report is paraphrased).  Human rights  An early March 2016 United Nations OHCHR report stated that people that lived in separatist controlled areas were experiencing \\"complete absence of rule of law, reports of arbitrary detention, torture and incommunicado detention, and no access to real redress mechanisms\\".Ukraine: growing despair among over three million civilians in conflict zone ‚Äì UN report, United Nations (3 March 2016) = War crimes = An 18 November 2014 United Nations report on eastern Ukraine stated that the Donetsk People's Republic was in a state of \\"total breakdown of law and order\\". The report noted \\"cases of serious human rights abuses by the armed groups continued to be reported, including torture, arbitrary and incommunicado detention, summary executions, forced labour, sexual violence, as well as the destruction and illegal seizure of property may amount to crimes against humanity\\".Almost 1,000 dead since east Ukraine truce - UN, BBC News (21 November 2014) Ukraine death toll rises to more than 4,300 despite ceasefire - U.N., Reuters (21 November 2014) The November report also stated \\"the HRMMU continued to receive allegations of sexual and gender-based violence in the eastern regions. In one reported incident, members of the pro-Russian Vostok Battalion \\"arrested\\" a woman for violating a curfew and beat her with metal sticks for three hours. The woman was also raped by several pro-Russian rebels from the battalion. The report also states that the UN mission \\"continued to receive reports of torture and ill-treatment by the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies and volunteer battalions and by the (pro-Russian separatist) armed groups, including beating, death threats, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and lack of access to medical assistance\\". In a 15 December 2014 press conference in Kyiv, UN Assistant Secretary-General for human rights Ivan ≈†imonoviƒá stated that the majority of human rights violations were committed in areas controlled by pro-Russian rebels.Majority of human rights violations in Ukraine committed by militants - UN, Interfax-Ukraine (15 December 2014) The United Nations report also accused the Ukrainian Army and Ukrainian (volunteer) territorial defense battalions, including the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion, of human rights abuses such as illegal detention, torture and ill- treatment of DPR and LPR supporters, noting official denials. Amnesty International reported on 24 December 2014 that pro-government volunteer battalions were blocking Ukrainian aid convoys from entering separatist- controlled territory. On 24 July, Human Rights Watch accused the pro-Russian fighters of not taking measures to avoid encamping in densely populated civilian areas.\\" It also accused Ukrainian government forces and pro- government volunteer battalions of indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas, stating that \\"The use of indiscriminate rockets in populated areas violates international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, and may amount to war crimes.\\"\\"Human Rights Watch: Ukrainian forces are rocketing civilians\\". The Washington Post. 25 July 2014. A report by the OHCHR Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that was released on 2 March 2015 described media postings and online videos which indicated that the pro- Russian armed groups of the Donetsk People's Republic carried out \\"summary, extrajudicial or arbitrary executions\\" of captured Ukrainian soldiers. In one incident, corpses of Ukrainian servicemen were found with \\"their hands tied with white electrical cable\\" after the pro-Russian rebel groups captured Donetsk International Airport. In January one of the self-proclaimed leaders of the Donetsk People's Republic claimed that the rebel forces were detaining up to five \\"subversives\\" between the ages of 18 and 35 per day. A number of captured prisoners of war were forced to march in Donetsk while being assaulted by rebel soldiers and onlookers. The report also said that Ukrainian law enforcement agencies had engaged in a \\"pattern of enforced disappearances, secret detention and ill-treatment\\" of people suspected of \\"separatism\\" and \\"terrorism\\". The report also mentions videos of members of one particular pro- Russian unit talking about running a torture facility in the basement of a Luhansk library. The head of the unit in question was the pro-Russian separatist commander Aleksandr Biednov, known as \\"Batman\\" (who was later killed) and the \\"head\\" of the torture chamber was a rebel called \\"Maniac\\" who \\"allegedly used a hammer to torture prisoners and surgery kit to scare and extract confessions from prisoners\\". In September 2015, OSCE published a report on the testimonies of victims held in places of illegal detention in Donbass. In December 2015, a team led by Ma≈Çgorzata Gosiewska published a comprehensive report on war crimes in Donbass. = Allegations of anti- semitism = Alleged members of the Donetsk Republic carrying the flag of the Russian Federation, passed out a leaflet to Jews that informed all Jews over the age of 16 that they would have to report to the Commissioner for Nationalities in the Donetsk Regional Administration building and register their property and religion. It also claimed that Jews would be charged a $50 'registration fee'. If they did not comply, they would have their citizenship revoked, face 'forceful expulsion' and see their assets confiscated. The leaflet stated the purpose of registration was because \\"Jewish community of Ukraine supported Bendera Junta,\\" and \\"oppose the pro-Slavic People's Republic of Donetsk\\". The authenticity of the leaflet could not be independently verified. The New York Times, Haaretz, and The New Republic said the fliers were \\"most likely a hoax\\". France 24 also reported on the questionable authenticity of the leaflets. According to Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the leaflets looked like some sort of provocation, and an attempt to paint the pro-Russian forces as anti-semitic. The chief rabbi of Donetsk Pinchas Vishedski stated that the flyer was a fake meant to discredit the self-proclaimed republic, and saying that anti-Semitic incidents in eastern Ukraine are \\"rare, unlike in Kiev and western Ukraine\\" and believes the men were 'trying to use the Jewish community in Donetsk as an instrument in the conflict;' however, he also called the DPR Press Secretary Aleksander Kriakov \\"the most famous anti-Semite in the region\\" and questioned DPR's decision to appoint him. = Religion = At first the Donetsk People's Republic adopted a \\"constitution\\" which stated that the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate was the official religion of the self- declared state. This was changed with the promulgation of a law \\"on freedom of conscience and religious organisation\\" in November 2015, backed by three deputies professing Rodnovery (Slavic native faith), whose members organised the Svarozhich Battalion (of the Vostok Brigade) and the Rusich Company.\\"Locked up in the Donbas A look at the mass arrests and torture of civilians in Donetsk and Lugansk\\".

Donbass has been documented as being a stronghold of Rodnovery, especially Russian Rodnover groups that are reorganising local villages and society according to traditional Indo-European trifunctionalism (according to which males are born to play one out of three roles in society, whether priests, warriors or farmers).Goble, Paul A. \\"Some in Donbas who want to create a new ‚ÄòRussian world‚Äô are reaching back to pre- Christian times\\". Euromaidan Press, 2015/06/24. Retrieved 2017/04/18. Donetsk separatists consider Christian denominations such as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ‚Äì Kyiv Patriarchate, Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and wider Roman Catholic Church, and Protestantism, as all being anti-Russian and see them as obstacles in the path of the separatist goal of uniting the region with Russia. To complement this emphasis on Orthodoxy against churches deemed \\"heretical\\" and anti-Russian, the separatists have been successful in enlisting the widespread support of many people in Donetsk belonging to the indigenous Greek Orthodox community. These are mainly Pontic Greeks settled in Donetsk and elsewhere in southern Russia and Ukraine since the Middle Ages, and are in the main descendants of refugees from the Pontic Alps, Eastern Anatolia, and the Crimea, dating to the Ottoman conquests of these regions in the late 15th century. There have been widespread media reports of these ethnic Greeks and those with roots in southern Ukraine now living in mainly Northern Greece fighting with Donetsk separatist forces on the justification that their war represents a struggle for Christian Orthodoxy against the forces of what they often describe as \\"schismatics\\" and \\"fascists\\".See for example, 'Sputnik News', 27 Aug 2014. According to Bishop Jan Sobilo, in Kramatorsk a Catholic chapel was fired upon and parishioners are afraid to attend worship services. Donetsk's Greek Catholic (Uniate) Church priest, Father Tikhon Kulbaka, states he received two text messages with explicit threats. Also, the address of his chapel and his phone number have appeared on pro-Russian websites. Another Catholic priest, Pawel Witek, was kidnapped for a day where he was interrogated and accused of being a \\"Polish sniper\\" sent by the Polish government. Members of a Gospel Church were forcibly dispersed at gunpoint by Donetsk insurgents on 23 May. A Protestant clergyman Sergiy Kosyak was held at the RSA building in Donetsk and interrogated, threatened, and beaten in a room marked \\"NKVD\\" for several hours by five men and one woman with clubs, batons, and whips. His injuries included a brain concussion. Kosyak stated that \\"religious intolerance is on the rise\\" and believed his religion was a motivating factor of the attack. Patriarch Filaret also spoke about \\"numerous death threats against the Kiev Patriarchate clergy and believers\\" in the Donetsk areas controlled by the rebels. Jehovah's Witnesses have also faced widespread discrimination. By January 2015, rebel groups had taken possession of 14 Kingdom Halls in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Metropolitan of Donetsk and Mariupol, Illarion, has refused to take sides in the conflict. As of 29 August 2018, 16 Kingdom Halls were confiscated. On 26 September 2018, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses were officially labelled as \\"extremist\\", with their activities banned in the country. = Romani people = Hundreds of Romani families fled Donbass in 2014. The News of Donbass reported that members of the Donbass People's Militia engaged in assaults and robbery on the Romani (also known as Roma or gypsies) population of Sloviansk. The armed separatists beat women and children, looted homes, and carried off the stolen goods in trucks, according to eyewitnesses. Romani have fled en masse to live with relatives in other parts of the country, fearing ethnic cleansing, displacement and murder. Some men who have decided to remain are forming militia groups to protect their families and homes. DPR Mayor Ponomarev said the attacks were only against Romani who were involved in drug trafficking, and that he was 'cleaning the city from drugs.' The US mission to the OSCE and Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk condemned these actions. =LGBT community= On 8 June 2014, it was reported that armed militants from the Donetsk Republic attacked a gay club in the capital of Donetsk, injuring several. Witnesses said 20 people forced their way into the club, stealing jewelry and other valuables; the assailants fired shots in the club, and several people were hurt. In July 2015, a DPR Ministry of Information spokeswoman stated \\"there are no gays in Donetsk, as they all went to Kyiv\\".Gays in Donetsk face fear as Russian influence takes grip, Kyiv Post (31 July 2015) In 2015, the Deputy Minister of Political Affairs of the Donetsk People's Republic stated: \\"A culture of homosexuality is spreading‚Ä¶ This is why we must kill anyone who is involved in this.\\" =Prejudice against Ukrainian speakers= On 18 April 2014, Vyacheslav Ponomarev asked local residents of Sloviansk to report all suspicious persons, especially if they are speaking in Ukrainian language. He also promised that the local media will publish a phone number for reporting. An 18 November 2014 United Nations report on eastern Ukraine stated that the Donetsk People's Republic violated the rights of Ukrainian-speaking children because schools in rebel-controlled areas teach only in Russian and forbid Ukrainian to be spoken by pupils. = Abductions = The Committee to Protect Journalists said that separatists had seized up to ten foreign reporters during the week following the shooting down of the Malaysian aircraft. On 22 July 2014, armed men from the DPR abducted Ukrainian freelance journalist Anton Skiba as he arrived with a CNN crew at a hotel in Donetsk. The DPR often counters such accusations by pointing towards non-governmental organisations, such as Amnesty International's reporting that pro-Ukrainian volunteer paramilitary battalions, such as the Aidar Battalion, Donbas Battalion, Azov Battalion often acted like \\"renegade gangs\\", and were implicated in torture, abductions, and summary executions. Amnesty International and the (OHCHR) also raised similar concerns about Radical Party leader and Ukrainian MP Oleh Lyashko and his militia. Donetsk has also observed significant rise in violent crime (homicide, rape, including underage victims) under the control of separatist forces. In July 2015 local authorities of Druzhkovka, previously occupied by separatist forces, exposed a previous torture site in one of the town's cellars. On 2 June 2017 the freelance journalist Stanislav Aseyev was abducted. Firstly the de facto DNR government denied knowing his whereabouts but on 16 July, an agent of the DNR's Ministry of State Security confirmed that Aseyev was in their custody and that he was suspected of espionage. Independent media is not allowed to report from the DNR-controlled territory. Amnesty International, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the European Federation of Journalists, Human Rights Watch, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe, PEN International, Reporters Without Borders and the United States Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have called for the immediate release of Aseyev. He was released as part of a prison exchange and handed over to Ukrainian authorities on 29 December 2019. Sergey Zdrilyuk (\\"Abwehr\\"), former deputy of DNR militia, confirmed in 2020 that Igor Girkin personally executed prisoners of war he considered \\"traitors\\" or \\"spies\\". This statement was first made in Girkin's interview earlier that year, although Girkin insisted he executions were part of his \\"military tribunal based on laws of war\\". Girkin also confessed that he was involved in the murder of Volodymyr Ivanovych Rybak, a representative of Horlivka who was abducted on April 17, 2014 after trying to raise a Ukrainian flag: \\"Naturally, Rybak, as a person who actively opposed the \\"militias\\", was an enemy in my eyes. And his death, probably, is to some extent also under my responsibility\\". Education Russian singer Joseph Kobzon meets with school children in Donetsk, 28 May 2015 By the start of the 2015‚Äì2016 school-year DNR's authorities had overhauled the curriculum. Ukrainian language lessons were decreased from around eight hours a week to two hours; while the time devoted to Russian language and literature lessons were increased. The history classes were changed to give greater emphasis to the history of Donbass. The grading system was changed from (Ukraine's) 12-point scheme to the five-point grading system that is also used in Russia. According to the director of a College in Donetsk \\"We give students the choice between the two but the Russian one is taken into greater account\\". School graduates will receive a Russian certificate, allowing them to enter both local universities and institutions in Russia. In April 2016 DPR authorities designed \\"statehood awareness lessons\\" were introduced in schools (in territory controlled by them).  Culture  = Holidays = The main holidays in the republic include Victory Day (9 May) and Republic Day (11 May)http://mincult.govdnr.ru/den-respubliki. The latter celebrates the declaration of the DPR, acting as a sort of national day. The first traditional victory day parade took place on Artem Street in 2015. The parade usually begins, when the clock of the main post office strikes 9:00 am (MSK). = Sports = Ministry of Youth, Sports and Tourism is responsible for development of sports on territory of DPR. A Donetsk People's Republic national football team has represented the country in international games organized by ConIFA. Reactions =Donbass= Great Patriotic War Victory Day celebrations in Donetsk on 9 May 2014. * Donetsk City Council (and nine district councils of the city) distanced itself from the RSA occupiers and they stated (on 7 April): \\"The Donetsk city council and district councils continue working in the legal field. We see ensuring the vital functions of the city as our main task\\". * The Independent Trade Union of Miners in Donetsk announced it would not support the pro-Russian separatist movement. * Seven village councils, as well as the districts of Dobropillia Raion and Krasnoarmiisk Raion in Donetsk Oblast requested to secede to join Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The councils intend to hold a referendum. Dnipropetrovsk governor Ihor Kolomoisky announced that local referendums would take place to allow for his province to administer and provide service to cities in Donetsk and Luhansk which wish to secede. A vote on joining Dnipropetrovsk is scheduled for 11 May to coincide with the secessionist referendum. = Political reactions in Ukraine= * Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko pledged revenge against pro-Russian separatists after 19 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in a rocket attack. \\"Militants will pay hundreds of their lives for each life of our servicemen.

Canadian foreign affairs minister John Baird described events in Ukraine as \\"brazen and co-ordinated actions\\" by Russia. He said: \\"I don't know who the Russian Federation thinks it's kidding when it tries to pretend that it has nothing to do with them,\\" and that there are \\"very clear and disconcerting parallels between the developments in eastern Ukraine and those that took place before moved to annex Crimea.\\" He said to reporters \\"there's no doubt, for a good number of weeks, provocateurs and frankly thugs have been crossing the border\\" into Ukraine. * ‚Äì On 7 April 2014, Russia's foreign ministry said that Ukrainian authorities keep blaming the Russian government for all its troubles and stated that \\"Ukrainians want to get a clear answer from Kiev to all their questions. It's time to listen to these legal claims\\". It also stated it was \\"carefully observing\\" events in the east and south of Ukraine, and again called for \\"real constitutional reform\\" that would turn Ukraine into a federation. In a 7 April opinion piece in The Guardian, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov wrote that it was the west, and not Russia, that was guilty of destabilising Ukraine and that \\"Russia is doing all it can to promote early stabilisation in Ukraine\\". The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a stern statement condemning the \\"criminal order\\" by Kiev for armed aggression against Donetsk, \\"The Kiev authorities, who self-proclaimed themselves as a result of a coup, have embarked on the violent military suppression of the protests,\\", demanding that \\"the Maidan henchmen, who overthrew the legitimate president, immediately stop the war against their own people, fulfill all the obligations under the Agreement of 21 February.\\" Russian Federation formally distances itself from the DPR government and has not recognised it, but on numerous occasions Sergey Lavrov was making definite statements regarding its policy, e.g. deploying international peacekeeping mission in DPR. * ‚Äì British Foreign Secretary William Hague said there is no doubt that Moscow is behind the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. \\"There can't really be any real doubt that this is something that has been planned and brought about by Russia,\\" he said, adding that Russia was deliberately \\"violating the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine\\", and that \\"I don't think denials of Russian involvement have a shred of credibility.\\" * ‚Äì US Secretary of State John Kerry said on 7 April 2014 that the events \\"did not appear to be spontaneous\\" and called on Russia to \\"publicly disavow the activities of separatists, saboteurs and provocateurs\\" in a phone call to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council claimed that the separatists appeared to be supported by Russia. \\"We saw similar so-called protest activities in Crimea before Russia's purported annexation,\\" she said in a statement, adding: \\"We call on President (Vladimir) Putin and his government to cease all efforts to destabilise Ukraine, and we caution against further military intervention.\\" US-Ukraine ambassador Geoffrey R. Pyatt characterised the pro-Russian militants as terrorists. = Political experts = * Ukrainian-American Alexander J. Motyl, professor of political science at Rutgers University argues that Russia's direct and indirect involvement in the violence in eastern Ukraine qualifies as a state-sponsored terrorism, and that those involved qualify as \\"terrorist groups\\". Motyl also said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on 20 February 2014 that Ukraine would be \\"better off\\" without \\"those three problematic provinces -- the two in the Donbas ‚Äî Luhansk and Donetsk ‚Äî and arguably even the Crimea\\". * Ethnic conflict expert Matthew Parish argues that the real cause for Russia pursuing the Donbass conflict is to destabilise Ukraine so that it cannot settle into the western sphere of influence.

During her career she has led fashion design teaching at both the Royal College of Art and Central Saint Martins, mentoring notable fashion designers including Stella McCartney and Hussein Chalayan. An influential designer in her own right in the 1970s and '80s with the Wendy Dagworthy label, and one of the founders of London Fashion Week, she was described by the Daily Telegraph as: \\"the high priestess of British fashion\\". Early life Wendy Ann Dagworthy was born in 1950 in Gravesend, Kent, the daughter of Jean A. (Stubbs) and Arthur Sidney Dagworthy. She was interested in fashion from an early age, noting that: \\"Sewing was something you did back then. You learnt needlework at school. There were no high-street shops where you could buy cheap clothes, so you would go to the market, buy some fabric and knock up your own\\". She was a pupil at Northfleet School for Girls, later attending Medway College of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts). She studied fashion at Hornsey College of Art, where her degree show attracted attention. Design company After leaving college, Dagworthy began working with the wholesale company Radley, which then owned the brand Ossie Clark. She was also creating her own designs and, at 22, she had her first collection to sell to London stores. These included the independent King's Road boutique Countdown ‚Äì the store's clients included Mick Jagger. One of Dagworthy's early personal customers was musician Bryan Ferry, who she had met through a Gravesend connection. She designed some of Roxy Music's stage costumes and also made Ferry a pair of monogrammed black silk pyjamas to wear in hospital while he was having his tonsils out. With a bank loan of ¬£800 and a further loan from her parents, the Wendy Dagworthy label was established in 1972. It operated initially from Dagworthy's flat and she would smuggle rolls of fabric up in the lift to avoid detection. She employed Betty Jackson as her fashion assistant as the business continued to grow, and she was also able to take on a studio in Berwick Street, Soho, a short walk from Carnaby Street. This was during the Three-Day Week and Dagworthy would have to go home at 4pm when the lights were switched off. =Label hallmarks= The Wendy Dagworthy label's trademark style was loose and unstructured, with a focus on natural fibres and textures, such as wool, mohair and wool barathea, and details such as detachable hoods and double pockets. Clothes combined bright patterns and colours, including florals, stripes and batik prints in shades such as scarlet and orange. The label was also known for its use of Liberty prints. Signature garments included circular skirts, oversized wool coats and wide cropped jackets. According to Dagworthy, the inspirations for her designs included menswear, workwear, ethnic clothing and the detailing found on shirts. =Company success and demise= Exports proved a particularly strong market for the label, and during the early 1980s almost half of Wendy Dagworthy output went to Italy. France and the US also proved to be good markets. As her business grew, Dagworthy became acknowledged as one of the key players in the London fashion scene, alongside her former assistant Betty Jackson, Jasper Conran and Paul Smith. The label exhibited in Paris, Milan and New York and Dagworthy was among the guests at the Downing Street fashion industry reception in 1984 where Katharine Hamnett wore a Pershing protest T-shirt. However, by 1988 and in the midst of a recession, Dagworthy's company went into voluntary liquidation. Recalling this period for an interview in the Daily Telegraph, she said: \\"And then it crashed. Suddenly the Italians stopped buying, the Americans stopped buying...\\" Advisory and academic roles Wendy Dagworthy continued to work in the industry, acting as a design consultant for brands such as Laura Ashley, Betty Jackson and Liberty. She worked to promote the UK fashion industry, both as a judge of numerous fashion awards and as an organiser of the forerunner of London Fashion Week. She became a member of the British Fashion Council in 1996. In 1989 she joined the staff of Central Saint Martins as head of fashion. During her nine-year tenure, she helped to train designers such as Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen, Hussein Chalayan, Antonio Berardi, Sonja Nuttall and Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro (Clements Ribeiro). Dagworthy joined the RCA in 1998 as course director and professor, teaching MA students. Two years later, she became head of its School of Fashion and Textiles and in 2011 was made head of the newly created School of Material, incorporating both fashion and textile disciplines. Students trained under Dagworthy include Erdem and Holly Fulton. Daworthy was appointed an OBE in the January 2011 New Year Honours for services to the fashion industry. Among her more recent advisory roles are contributing to the 2009 Design Museum exhibition Super Contemporary ‚Äì for which she contributed a personal 'map' charting the 1970s London fashion scene ‚Äì and acting as expert advisor to the V&A;'s 1980s exhibition From Club to Catwalk (2013‚Äì14). In January 2014, Dagworthy announced that she would be retiring from the RCA at the end of the academic year. In May 2014, the RCA held a celebratory exhibition, in tandem with its annual graduate fashion show, to mark her 16 years in the role of head of fashion.

The Latin word asper originally meant \\"rough\\", but had gradually acquired the connotation of \\"fresh\\" or \\"freshly minted\\", i.e. not worn smooth by use, and, especially when referring to silver, \\"white\\", by the imperial period. It acquired a technical meaning in the 12th century, when the Byzantines began to refer to the billon trachy coin, which was issued in a blanched state, as an aspron. The same name was also sometimes applied to the contemporary electrum trachy as well. The name re-appears in the 14th‚Äì15th centuries as a generic name for silver coinage, such as the Byzantine doukatopoulon or the Turkish ak√ße. The 15th century account books of the Venetian merchant-banker Giacomo Badoer lists several cities and governments that coined aspers, which included Trebizond, Caffa, Simisso (or Samsun), Tana, and Rhodes.Cecile Morrison, \\"Coin Usage and Exchange Rates in Badoer‚Äôs Libro dei Conti\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 55 (2001), pp. 217-245 References Sources * Category:Coins of the Byzantine Empire Category:Numismatic terminology ","title":"Aspron"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",I]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/66.md","filePath":"sponsor/66.md"}'),L={name:"sponsor/66.md"},N=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{F as __pageData,N as default};
