The team first rose to prominence when Def Jam founder Russell Simmons signed them to produce for rapper Breeze, leading to Simmons asking them to do pre-production on LL Cool J's 1987 album Bigger and Deffer. Bigger and Deffer was a huge success and led to L.A. Posse producing The Real Roxanne's eponymous album. During this period, Muffla also co-wrote Run-D.M.C.'s single \\"Beats to the Rhyme\\". In 1989, the L.A. Posse left Def Jam and signed with Atlantic Records, producing Breeze's album The Young Son of No One which yielded the charting rap single \\"L.A. Posse\\". Some of the members of the group also ended up producing on LL Cool J's later albums Walking with a Panther, Mama Said Knock You Out and 14 Shots to the Dome. Following this, the group recorded their own album, They Come in All Colors, in 1991.

It was filmed from July through August 1949, and released on December 30, 1950 by Paramount. It was re-released in 1958 by OMAT Pictures. Although filmed before My Friend Irma Goes West (1950), it was held back until the sequel to Martin and Lewis' smash film debut My Friend Irma (1949) was released. Plot The film is set at a United States Army base in Kentucky at the end of 1944, during World War II. The protagonists are First Sergeant Vic Puccinelli (Dean Martin) and Private First Class Alvin Korwin (Jerry Lewis), who were partners in a nightclub song-and-dance act before joining the Army. Puccinelli wants to be transferred from his dull job to active duty overseas, but is refused transfer and is to be promoted to Warrant Officer. Korwin wants a pass to see his wife and new baby. In addition, they have to rehearse for the base talent show and avoid the wrath of Alvin's platoon sergeant, Sergeant McVey (Mike Kellin). Along the way they both sing a few songs, and they do an impression of Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald by recreating a scene from Going My Way (1944) for the talent show. Further complications include a Post Exchange worker who is pregnant, a company commander who gets all his information from his wife, a scheming supply sergeant, and a defective Coca-Cola machine.

Pokey * Dewey Robinson as Bartender * Joe Gray as Soldier Production When Martin and Lewis signed their film contract with Paramount Pictures, they were allowed to make one film \\"outside\\" the studio per year through their own company, York Productions. This film was made under that provision, with the stars taking a small salary in exchange for 90 percent of the film's profits. However, upon its release, Martin and Lewis ended up in a long, drawn-out legal battle. After several years, they relinquished all financial interest in this film in exchange for not having to make any more of these \\"outside\\" ones. The copyright on this film was not renewed in 1977, resulting in its public domain status. The film is based on a play by James B. Allardice that ran for 151 performances from 1948-49 with Mike Kellin and Kenneth Forbes repeating their roles. The producers opened up the play by adding a sequence of an Absent Without Leave Lewis in drag fending off the amorous advances of his drunken platoon sergeant, a sequence on an obstacle course and the addition of several songs written by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. One of the later Martin and Lewis films, Sailor Beware (1952) had a working title of At Sea with the Navy.Billboard, August 4, 1951, p. 16 Copyright status This film's copyright was registered to York Pictures Corp. and Screen Associates, Inc. on January 23, 1951 (LP 679), and was renewed on December 7, 1979 (RE43009).Film Superlist: Motion Pictures in the U.S. Public Domain (1950 - 1959), p. 20 However, the film has since lapsed into the public domain as the copyright holders failed to renew their copyright in the 28th year of publication pursuant to the Copyright Act of 1909.

ITGAM is also known as CR3A, and cluster of differentiation molecule 11B (CD11B). The second chain of αMβ2 is the common integrin β2 subunit known as CD18, and integrin αMβ2 thus belongs to the β2 subfamily (or leukocyte) integrins. αMβ2 is expressed on the surface of many leukocytes involved in the innate immune system, including monocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells. It mediates inflammation by regulating leukocyte adhesion and migration and has been implicated in several immune processes such as phagocytosis, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, chemotaxis and cellular activation. It is involved in the complement system due to its capacity to bind inactivated complement component 3b (iC3b). The ITGAM (alpha) subunit of integrin αMβ2 is directly involved in causing the adhesion and spreading of cells but cannot mediate cellular migration without the presence of the β2 (CD18) subunit. In genomewide association studies, single nucleotide polymorphisms in ITGAM had the strongest association with systemic lupus erythematosus, with an odds ratio of 1.65 for the T allele of rs9888739 and lupus.

He was the brother of Sofia Nădejde, a feminist journalist, and the brother-in-law of Ioan Nădejde (an atheist and socialist thinker, editor of the magazine Contemporanul). Biography Born in Botoşani, he remained an orphan at age 4, and was raised in Iaşi by his much older sister and her husband, who first encouraged Octav's talent and passion for art.Epure, p. 4 After completing primary school, he entered the Fine Arts School in Iaşi, where he was taught by Gheorghe Panaiteanu Bardasare, Constantin Daniel Stahi, and Emanoil Bardasare, graduating in 1893. Between 1894 and 1897, he lived and studied abroad on a scholarship: first in Italy and France, and finally in Germany, where he studied under Nicholaos Gysis at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich (it is not known whether he ever graduated).Epure, p. 6 Upon his return, he attempted to open a studio in downtown Iaşi, but financial constraints forced him to settle on the outskirts; it was during that time that Băncilă began exploring his major themes: the lives of peasants, factory workers, impoverished Jewish traders and artisans, conscripted soldiers, and of nomadic Roma people.Epure, p. 6–9 After 1901, he taught calligraphy and art in primary schools in the city.Epure, p. 8 Impressed by the outcome of the 1905 Revolution in the Russian Empire, he was soon active in socialist circles, and became an acquaintance of major intellectual figures on the Left, including Gala Galaction and Paul Bujor.Epure, p. 8–10, 17, 22 In 1907, following the crushing of the Romanian Peasants' Revolt, Băncilă began traveling the country and attempting to gather evidence of government repression and violence. The result was a series of twelve paintings (not all of them surviving), including his famous figure of an old peasant standing open-armed (titled Înainte de 1907, \\"Before 1907\\"), several images of dead bodies piled up in fields (being looked on by soldiers), and the eponymous 1907, depicting three ragged peasants running into rifle fire.Epure, p. 11–14 Following the outbreak of World War I, he became involved in pacifist causes, using his work to comment on the results of conflict.Epure, p.18 In 1916, he was appointed professor at the Fine Arts School in Iaşi (a position he kept until his retirement in 1937). With Constantin Ion Parhon and Bujor, Băncilă founded, in 1919, the short-lived Laborer Party (Partidul Muncitor), soon fused into the Peasants' Party.Niculae et al., p. 9 He remained critical of social and political developments inside Greater Romania, was supportive of strike actions in the Jiu Valley, and used his art to attack anti-Semitic trends in Romanian society.Epure, p. 20 Towards the end of his life, he became to sympathise with communism (he was not, however, affiliated with the Communist Party of Romania).Frunză, p. 214 Notes ReferencesMaria Epure, Octav Băncilă, Editura de Stat pentru Literatură şi Artă, Bucharest, 1956 *Victor Frunză, Istoria stalinismului în România (\\"The History of Stalinism in Romania\\"), Humanitas, Bucharest, 1990 *Vasile Niculae, Ion Ilincioiu, Stelian Neagoe, Doctrina ţărănistă în România.

CR2 is involved in the complement system. It binds to iC3b (inactive derivative of C3b), C3dg, or C3d.Frank K, Atkinson JP (2001). \\"Complement system.\\" In Austen KF, Frank K, Atkinson JP, Cantor H. eds. Samter's Immunologic Diseases, 6th ed. Vol. 1, p. 281-298, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, . B cells express CR2 receptors on their surfaces, allowing the complement system to play a role in B-cell activation and maturation Interactions Complement receptor 2 interacts with CD19, and, on mature B cells, forms a complex with CD81 (TAPA-1). The CR2-CD19-CD81 complex is often called the B cell co-receptor complex,Abbas AK, Lichtman AH (2003). Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders, because CR2 binds to opsonized antigens through attached C3d (or iC3b or C3dg) when the B-cell receptor binds antigen. This results in the B cell having greatly enhanced response to the antigen. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can bind CR2, enabling EBV to enter and infect B cells. Yefenof et al. (1976) found complete overlapping of EBV receptors and C3 receptors on human B cells. Isoforms The canonical Cr2/CD21 gene of subprimate mammals produces two types of complement receptor (CR1, ca. 200 kDa; CR2, ca. 145 kDa) via alternative mRNA splicing. The murine Cr2 gene contains 25 exons; a common first exon is spliced to exon 2 and to exon 9 in transcripts encoding CR1 and CR2, respectively. A transcript with an open reading frame of 4,224 nucleotides encodes the long isoform, CR1; this is predicted to be a protein of 1,408 amino acids that includes 21 short consensus repeats (SCR) of ca. 60 amino acids each, plus transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Isoform CR2 (1,032 amino acids) is encoded by a shorter transcript (3,096 coding nucleotides) that lacks exons 2-8 encoding SCR1-6. CR1 and CR2 on murine B cells form complexes with a co-accessory activation complex containing CD19, CD81, and the fragilis/Ifitm (murine equivalents of LEU13) proteins. The CR2 gene of primates produces only the smaller isoform, CR2; primate complement receptor 1, which recapitulates many of the structural domains and presumed functions of Cr2-derived CR1 in subprimates, is encoded by a distinct CR1 gene (apparently derived from the gene Crry of subprimates). Isoforms CR1 and CR2 derived from the non-primate Cr2 locus possess the same C-terminal sequence, such that association with and activation through CD19 should be equivalent. CR1 can bind to C4b and C3b complexes, whereas CR2 (murine and human) binds to C3dg-bound complexes. CR1, a surface protein produced primarily by follicular dendritic cells, appears to be critical for generation of appropriately activated B cells of the germinal centre and for mature antibody responses to bacterial infection. Immunohistochemistry Although CR2 is present on all mature B-cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), this becomes readily apparent only when immunohistochemistry is performed on frozen sections. In more conventional paraffin-embedded tissue samples, only the FDCs retain the staining pattern. As a result, CR2, more commonly called CD21 in the context of immunohistochemistry, can be used to demonstrate the FDC meshwork in lymphoid tissue. This feature can be useful in examining tissue where the normal germinal centres have been effaced by disease processes, such as HIV infection. The pattern of the FDC meshwork may also be altered in some neoplastic conditions, such as B-cell MALT lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma, and some T cell lymphomas. Castleman's disease is typified by the presence of abnormal FDCs, and both this, and malignant FDC tumours may therefore be demonstrated using CR2/CD21 antibodies.

Units typically represent lances, but there are provisions for allowing the counters to represent larger units/formations, such as companies, battalions, and so forth. Normal BattleTech game play usually is set up for small encounters (up to 12 units per side). Though large battles are possible using the normal games rules for BattleTech, the game can consume a lot of time to play. BattleForce was designed to remedy this problem. The game allows wide use of units (vehicles, Battlemechs, air vehicles, etc.). Revision and Revival In 2006, BattleTech was relaunched, revising and reprinting many its rule sets under the name of the BattleTech: Total Warfare rule set. A supplementary rulebook called Strategic Operations includes several chapters for revised and updated edition of BattleForce and its successor Battleforce 2. New units have been added to BattleForce game (including new units added to BattleTech since its launch, including Large Naval Vessels). While BattleForce's elements appear in Interstellar Operations which will be a component of large scale combat operations on interstellar scale (Solar System to Solar System vs planetary operation which BattleForce is originally conceived for). Basic Rules In its simplest description the game of BattleForce is still a tactical level game comparable to BattleTech, but on a slightly larger scale. Individual vehicles still retain statistics to track, but are much simplified over the normal game of BattleTech. For example, in BattleTech a BattleMech combat robot is tracked internally for 8 locations and for exterior armor in 11 locations, but in the game of BattleForce there is a pair of stats for armor and internal structure as a whole, both of which are usually single digit numbers between 1 and 9. Combat units are grouped together and move together in small units rather than independently. There are also far less complicated rules for movement and for variables like terrain and movement's effect on weapon accuracy.

A missing data mechanism such as a treatment assignment or survey sampling strategy is \\"ignorable\\" if the missing data matrix, which indicates which variables are observed or missing, is independent of the missing data conditional on the observed data. This idea is part of the Rubin Causal Inference Model, developed by Donald Rubin in collaboration with Paul Rosenbaum in the early 1970s. The exact definition differs between their articles in that period. In one of Rubins articles from 1978 Rubin discuss ignorable assignment mechanisms, which can be understood as the way individuals are assigned to treatment groups is irrelevant for the data analysis, given everything that is recorded about that individual. Later, in 1983 Rubin and Rosenbaum rather define strongly ignorable treatment assignment which is a stronger condition, mathematically formulated as (r_1,r_0) \\\\perp \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\perp z v ,\\\\quad 0, where r_t is a potential outcome given treatment t, v is some covariates and z is the actual treatment. Pearl [2000] devised a simple graphical criterion, called back-door, that entails ignorability and identifies sets of covariates that achieve this condition. Ignorability (better called exogeneity) simply means we can ignore how one ended up in one vs. the other group (‘treated’ Tx = 1, or ‘control’ Tx = 0) when it comes to the potential outcome (say Y). It was also called unconfoundedness, selection on the observables, or no omitted variable bias. Formally it has been written as [Yi1, Yi0] ⊥ Txi, or in words the potential Y outcome of person _i_ had they been treated or not does not depend on whether they have really been (observable) treated or not. We can ignore in other words how people ended up in one vs. the other condition, and treat their potential outcomes as exchangeable. While this seems thick, it becomes clear if we add subscripts for the ‘realized’ and superscripts for the ‘ideal’ (potential) worlds (notation suggested by David Freedman; a visual can help here: potential outcomes simplified). So: Y11/*Y01 are potential Y outcomes had the person been treated (superscript 1), when in reality they have actually been (Y11, subscript 1), or not (*Y01: the * signals this quantity can never be realized or observed, or is fully contrary-to-fact or counterfactual, CF). Similarly, *Y10/Y00 are potential Y outcomes had the person not been treated (superscript 0), when in reality they have been (*Y10, subscript 1), or not actually (Y00). Only one of each potential outcome (PO) can be realized, the other cannot, for the same assignment to condition, so when we try to estimate treatment effects, we need something to replace the fully contrary-to-fact ones with observables (or estimate them). When ignorability/exogeneity holds, like when people are randomized to be treated or not, we can ‘replace’ *Y01 with its observable counterpart Y11, and *Y10 with its observable counterpart Y00, not at the individual level Yi’s, but when it comes to averages like E[Yi1 – Yi0], which is exactly the causal treatment effect (TE) one tries to recover. Because of the ‘consistency rule’, the potential outcomes are the values actually realized, so we can write Yi0 = Yi00 and Yi1 = Yi11 (“the consistency rule states that an individual’s potential outcome under a hypothetical condition that happened to materialize is precisely the outcome experienced by that individual”, p. 872). Hence TE = E[Yi1 – Yi0] = E[Yi11 – Yi00]. Now, by simply adding and subtracting the same fully counterfactual quantity *Y10 we get: E[Yi11 – Yi00] = E[Yi11 –*Y10 +*Y10 \\\\- Yi00] = E[Yi11 –*Y10] + E[*Y10 \\\\- Yi00] = ATT + {Selection Bias}, where ATT = average treatment effect on the treated and the second term is the bias introduced when people have the choice to belong to either the ‘treated’ or the ‘control’ group. Ignorability, either plain or conditional on some other variables, implies that such selection bias can be ignored, so one can recover (or estimate) the causal effect.

Description  The Molch was based on torpedo technology, and carried two G7e torpedoes attached externally on either side of the craft. It was fully electrical and was created for coastal operations, with a range of at . The front section of the boat held a large battery. Behind the battery was the operator's position, which sat between two small trimming tanks. Behind the operator sat the electric motor. The complicated system of tanks made it difficult to control during combat operations. The first of 393 boats were delivered on June 12, 1944 and were built by AG Weser in Bremen.

Growing more and more depressed and withdrawn, he finds solace only in the nickelodeon cinemas of the time and dies prematurely. Part II The remainder of Clarence's family moves to the small town of Basingstoke, Delaware to live with Clarence's sister Esther. This next section which covers the 1920s, focuses on Clarence's youngest son Ted. A quiet child, he grows up to be a diffident adult, much like his father. He gradually becomes involved with an equally shy young woman called Emily with a stunted and deformed foot whose family is socially looked down on, possibly because it is rumored her mother is part black. On their first date they see the Greta Garbo feature Flesh and the Devil. (The film stars of the 1920s are frequently mentioned, but unlike his father, Ted takes little pleasure in movies, finding them exhausting and intrusive). His mother and Aunt Esther (Clarence's sister), disappointed with Ted's choice of Emily as a girlfriend and his general lack of ambition, sends him to stay with his older brother Jared in New York City. Jared has married the daughter of a bootlegger and is involved in shady schemes himself. Ted is uncomfortable with the job Jared finds for him as a rent collector in immigrant neighborhoods and feels out of place at the speakeasies Jared and his friends frequent. He decides to return home and marry Emily; his mother and aunt resign themselves to Ted's choice of a bride and find him a job as a postman which he works at contentedly for decades. His marriage to Emily proves emotionally and sexually fulfilling, and by the end of the second section they are the parents of a baby daughter named Esther. Part III In the following section, Esther (nicknamed Essie) becomes the main protagonist. A beautiful and confident, if somewhat arrogant, little girl, she decides at a young age that she wants to be a movie star. She gets her first real break at eighteen when she agrees to a photo shoot with a photographer who noticed her at a beauty contest. He asks to photograph her topless and after hesitating, she agrees. Later she moves to New York City to stay with her wealthy cousin Patrick who has offered to further her career. Assuming that Patrick is expecting sexual favors from her, she tries to seduce him, but Patrick rebuffs her and later tells her he is a homosexual. Esther finds work modeling and gradually begins appearing in films, typically as a spunky girl next door similar to Judy Garland. Renamed Alma DeMott, she gradually becomes a minor celebrity. A number of actual Hollywood personalities from this time are featured, including Gary Cooper and Clark Gable who are two of her first co- stars. She has a brief affair with Gable, and Cooper gives her fatherly advice about acting. Harry Cohn also makes an appearance. At age 29, just when she is fearing her career is starting to decline, Alma becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son she names Clark, in honor of Clark Gable who is recently deceased. She makes a successful comeback in a series of musicals, but her son grows up neglected. Part IV The final section focuses on Clark and jumps ahead to the late 1980s when he is an aimless young man halfheartedly working as a ski lift operator for his great uncle Jared in Colorado. The evening after an altercation with another employee, he meets a young woman called Hannah who invites him home with her. It turns out she lives in a religious commune, similar to that of the Branch Davidians. Clark agrees to stay on, partially out of aimlessness and attraction to Hannah, but also because the group's puritanical stance on modern American pop culture, particularly movies, appeals to him (reversing the stance of his great grandfather who abandoned religion and embraced the newly born film industry). The group consists of several young adults and their children, led by the charismatic but controlling Jesse. Turning more and more away from modern American life, the group grows increasingly paranoid and isolated, refusing to send its children to school and shooting at a school bus driver. This eventually leads to a siege similar to that at Waco. Jesse orders Clark and the other adult male followers to shoot all the women and children; Clark however rebels and shoots Jesse instead. This action ends up saving most of the women and children, although Clark is shot and killed himself soon afterward. A number of Clark's relatives, including Ted (now a widower in his nineties) view the siege on the television news. Despite their shock and grief they are proud that the young man most of them had dismissed years ago as a loser has saved so many lives. Reception Critic James Wood called it 'a complacent historical saga'. Writer and critic Joseph Bottum criticized the book, writing that it seemed to be \\"...an abstract for a novel rather than the finished thing\\".

Hill House in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, was built by railroad magnate James J. Hill. The house, completed in 1891, is near the eastern end of Summit Avenue near the Cathedral of Saint Paul. The house, for its time, was very large and was the \\"showcase of St. Paul\\" until James J. Hill's death in 1916. and It is listed as a U.S. National Historic Landmark, operated by the Minnesota Historical Society. It is also a contributing property to the Historic Hill District. The home has 36,000 square feet (3,344 square meters) of living area and 44,552 square feet of total space. History Hill bought three lots on Summit Avenue in 1882, during an era when wealthy citizens were scrambling to build fashionable homes in the neighborhood. The street offered a commanding view of downtown St. Paul and the Mississippi River area, making it a highly desirable location. The family previously lived in the Lowertown area in St. Paul, near Ninth and Canada streets. As new warehouses and railroad tracks crowded the Lowertown residential area, and as Hill's collection of paintings and sculpture overflowed the house, the Hill family thought it was desirable to move. Hill also realized that recent improvements in home technology, such as electric lighting, plumbing, ventilation, and fireproofing, could be incorporated into a new home. Moreover, since Hill was becoming a socially prominent person in the community, a new home would stand as a tribute to his status as the \\"Empire Builder\\". The house was designed by an East Coast architectural firm, Peabody, Stearns and Furber, at a time when other homes in the neighborhood were designed by local architects such as Clarence Johnston and Cass Gilbert. The house was designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, with a massive, rugged style featuring randomly sized blocks of stone, sturdy pillars, rounded arches, and a generally strong horizontal emphasis. Hill supervised the design and construction closely. As an example, when the Lewis Comfort Tiffany Company submitted designs for the stained glass windows, Hill replied that they were, \\"anything but what I want,\\" and the job went to A.B. Cutter and Company of Boston. Later, in 1889, Hill fired the architects because they had overridden his orders to the stonecutters in Massachusetts, and hired the Boston firm of Irving and Casson to finish the project. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reviewed the house just before it was completed in 1891, saying: > Solid, substantial, roomy, and comfortable is the new home of James J. Hill > and family. ... There has been no attempt at display, no desire to flaunt an > advertisement of wealth in the eyes of the world. Just a family home ... > impressive, fine, even grand in the simplicity of design, but after all a > St. Paul home. Interior Pipe organ in the art gallery The interior features an art gallery that housed Hill's collection of painting and sculpture. It even had a pipe organ, installed after someone suggested to Hill that other wealthy people had pipe organs in their homes. The house had a hybrid system of gas and electric lighting, with rotary switches on the walls to turn on the electric lights. However, there were no electrical outlets installed, because during that era electricity was only used for lighting. The woodwork in the house is very intricate, with hand-carved woodworking in the central hallway, the formal dining room, and the music room. Other rooms in the house, particularly on the second floor where most of the family members lived, do not have hand carved woodwork, but the woodwork is still richly colored and nicely detailed. The grand staircase The first floor, in addition to the art gallery, music room, hall, and formal dining room previously mentioned, also had a library, a drawing room, and Mr. Hill's home office. The second floor contained Mr. and Mrs. Hill's rooms, two guest rooms, and rooms for their five daughters, Gertrude, Rachel, Clara, Ruth, and Charlotte. The third floor contained rooms for their sons James, Walter, and Louis (who later succeeded his father as president of the Great Northern Railway). It also had a room that served as a gymnasium and school room for the children, as well as quarters for the servants. Later history After James J. Hill died in 1916 and his wife died in 1921, the children eventually moved out. In 1925, four of the daughters purchased the house from the estate and donated it to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis. The church used it for the next fifty-three years as space for offices, residences, and a teacher's college for women. The church preserved it well and did not make any significant alterations, although most of the original furniture was sold during this period. In 1961, the United States Department of the Interior designated the house a National Historic Landmark. The Minnesota Historical Society acquired the house in 1978, after the Archdiocese consolidated its offices elsewhere. The house has been restored and is now open for tours.

Set in Washington, D.C., it is a spy novel about an international conspiracy of the \\"Latin\\" countries against the English-speaking world with the aim to take over world control. Plot summary The eponymous heroine, Isabel Thorne, is a young woman, half British, half Italian, who works for the Italian Secret Service. She has been commissioned to bring about the signing of a secret contract, in the capital of the enemy, by representatives of all countries involved, both European and American. Her brother, an inventor, has devised a secret weapon by which missiles can be fired from submarines (see also depth charge) which will, it is hoped, secure military domination over the rest of the world. Members of the U.S. Secret Service, who have been alerted, are assigned to prevent the signing of this \\"Latin compact\\" and bring to justice those involved who have no diplomatic immunity. One young representative named Grimm, however, although absolutely loyal to his government, falls in love with the beautiful foreign agent, Thorne. In the end Thorne, who reciprocates her admirer's love, becomes estranged from her employer, the Italian government, because she does not want Grimm, who has been captured by the conspirators and knows all their secrets, to be murdered.

Alli currently resides in Portland, Oregon, where he conducts workshops and stages theatrical productions, some of which have been released as films. Alli is also a professional astrologer and has authored books on experimental theatre, astrology and Timothy Leary's 8-circuit model of consciousness. Film and theatrical work Alli refers to his forty years of work in experimental theatre as paratheatre, a term borrowed from the writings of Jerzy Grotowski. He conducted private paratheatrical workshops in the Bay Area (1977–83 and 1996–2015), some of which have evolved into public productions and provided the material for his films. In late 2015, he relocated to Portland Oregon to continue his paratheatrical work. Between 1976 and 1999, Alli wrote and directed a series of stageplays exploring mystical themes in Circles (1976), Coronation at Stillnight (1977), The Conjunction (1978), Chapel Perilous (1983), Animamundi (1989), and Hungry Ghosts of Albion (1999). Between 1992 and 2002 Antero co-curated the Nomad Film Festival, a Pacific coast touring venue featuring short experimental films and videos. Since 1993, Antero has redirected his focus to the creation of underground feature-length art films with mystical themes such as The Oracle (1993), The Drivetime (1995), Tragos (2001), Hysteria (2002), Under a Shipwrecked Moon (2003) and The Greater Circulation (2005), a cinematic treatment of Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke's Requiem For a Friend. In 2015, he quit making feature films to return full-time to creating intermedia ritual-based theatre works such as \\"Turbulence of Muses\\" (Dec 2016), \\"Bardoville\\" (May 2017), and \\"Soror Mystica\\" (Dec 2017) Writing Alli's books span a number of subjects, but all share common themes with his paratheatrical efforts: archetypes, personal mythology and the use of ritual to transform consciousness. Like his colleague Rob Brezsny, Alli proposes a free will approach to astrology, which advocates providing clients with the information to make decisions instead of deterministic predictions. In Towards an Archaeology of the Soul (2003), Alli presents a detailed account of the theories and processes that go into his own paratheatrical creations. Between 1991–95, Alli was editor/publisher of Talking Raven Quarterly, a Seattle-based literary journal featuring the writings of Robert Anton Wilson, Hakim Bey, and Rob Brezsny among others. In Spring and Fall 2006, Alli taught a course on his book AngelTech at Robert Anton Wilson's Maybe Logic Academy. BooksAlli, Antero (1987). AngelTech. New Falcon. *Alli, Antero (1988).

Operated by the Norwegian Armed Forces, it serves the island's only population at the combined military and meteorological station. It has a dirt runway numbered 06–24. The airfield was built in connection with the LORAN-C transmitter at Olonkinbyen and was completed in 1960. Jan Mayensfield is served eight times per year by Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft of the 335 Squadron from Bodø Main Air Station, which provide supplies and change crew at the outpost. The nearby Beerenberg volcano can cause a Kármán wind, which creates difficult landing conditions. History North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Norwegian Armed Forces started construction of a military communications outpost at Olonkinbyen in 1958. At first a LORAN-A transmitter was built,Barr (1991): 236 followed by a LORAN-C transmitter in 1960. In August, it was announced that the island would receive an airfield to allow continual operation of the transmitter.Barr (1991): 247 Originally, the aerodrome consisted of a section of the island's dirt road. This was chosen to reduce the bureaucracy of construction. The first aircraft to land was a Consolidated PBY Catalina of the Royal Norwegian Air Force on 17 September 1960.Barr (1991): 245 Map which includes the location of the airfield The first civilian aircraft was a Douglas DC-4 operated by Braathens SAFE, which landed with some journalists on board on 29 October 1961. Other early aircraft operating to Jan Mayen were the Grumman HU-16 Albatross and the Douglas DC-6. The head officer of the Norwegian military's communications division was later criticized by Chief of Defence Bjarne Øen, who concluded: \\"Gentlemen, I will not have any further construction of airports on Norwegian soil by the Communications Division without the plans being presented to the Central Command.\\" The field was named Jan Mayensfield, in part as a joke having the movie star Jayne Mansfield in mind, but this name stuck.Etablering av Loran på Jan Mayen (in Norwegian) In 1970, a sudden eruption in Beerenberg forced the immediate evacuation of the station. A Hercules was dispatched to the island and successfully landed on the strip. Thereafter the Hercules became the regular military aircraft at Jan Mayen.Arheim (1994): 132 Aircraft gradually took over more of the transport to the island, and from 1973 all supplies except diesel and special freight was transported by ship. From 1975 the 333 Squadron would occasionally drop mail and supplies using the P-3 Orion as a supplement to the landings of the Hercules.Arheim (1994): 116 Facilities Jan Mayensfield's single regular service is the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules, which operate to the island eight times per year. The aircraft are part of the 335 Squadron, based at Gardermoen Air Station, although the flights from Jan Mayen operate from Bodø Main Air Station.Barr (1991): 254 The runway is not open for commercial traffic, although it can be used for research and search and rescue operations. The dirt runway is being aligned 06–24. Jan Mayensfield has variable weather conditions, a lot of fog and often has a Kármán wind. The Kármán wind is created in the wake of the Beerenberg volcano, resulting in regular vortex streets and lee-waves. This can cause sudden change to the wind direction on the island. Accidents and incidents In 1991, a C-130 Hercules aircraft from the Royal Norwegian Air Force almost crashed after take off due to Kármán wind suddenly shifting. A World War II plane crash site is also near the airfield.

His mother (Ruth Hussey) is another former star athlete, having been a champion Olympic swimmer. Junior is something of a disappointment to his father, who has a difficult time understanding how two athletes could produce such a weakling.

After short periods working in the City and in public relations, Dempster joined the Daily Express in 1963 and remained at the title until 1971. Here he was a contributor to the 'William Hickey' column, and used his contacts to gain stories about the aristocracy and other public figures. He was then on the staff of the Daily Mail from 1971 to 2003, where he was initially deputy to Paul Callan, but replaced him as the newspaper's diarist in 1973.Michael Leapman \\"Nigel Dempster\\" – Obituary, The Independent, 13 July 2007.

Supposedly this took everyone by surprise, but a contact of Dempster's had overheard the Foreign Secretary James Callaghan discussing it. Dempster was also close to Princess Margaret, despite breaking news of her liaison with Roddy Llewellyn.\\"Columnist Dempster dies aged 65\\", BBC News, 12 July 2007. Retrieved on 13 July 2007. Dempster also wrote for Private Eye from 1969, where he was responsible with Peter McKay for the \\"Grovel\\" column,Dennis Griffiths (ed.) The Encyclopedia of the British Press 1422–1992, London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p.198 but left in 1985, shortly before Ian Hislop succeeded Richard Ingrams as editor. In \\"Grovel\\", Dempster was able to include material which could not be published elsewhere,Jonathan Sale Review: \\"Nigel Dempster and the Death of Discretion, By Tim Willis\\", Belfast Telegraph, 5 November 2010 and the column was the location of the first articles in the Eye to which James Goldsmith took exception. According to Hislop, Dempster fell out with the publication because he felt (in common with colleague Auberon Waugh) that he should be editor instead of Hislop. The differences allegedly began over an article making false accusations concerning the Conservative politician Cecil Parkinson and his new secretary (after Sara Keays) in Eye 606. The issue had to be reprinted (606A) after a court action with the offending and inaccurate item omitted. According to another source it ended when Dempster revealed that Richard Ingrams' marriage was in serious difficulties; Ingrams, an admirer, had previously called Dempster the \\"greatest living Englishman\\".According to A. N. Wilson, Auberon Waugh coined the appellation. See Wilson's \\"Was Nigel Dempster our Proust?\\", Daily Telegraph, 22 October 2007 As a result of the differences with Private Eye Dempster was nicknamed 'Nigel Pratt-Dumpster' whenever he was subsequently mentioned, and became a frequent target of parody by the magazine. After he left the Eye, he began writing his column for the Mail on Sunday in 1986, and thus it now appeared seven days a week. Reportedly a difficult colleague, Dempster missed out on scoops about Princess Diana, and even boasted at one point that he had not met her, according to his Daily Telegraph obituary. He began to drink more, with several incidents involving police breathalysers, and wrote less; his columns had actually been the work of four people rather than Dempster alone. In the view of observers, Dempster's column in his last years lost its bite, and in his industry he was considered something of a relic: \\"by now a brand rather than a journalistic asset\\". Paul Dacre, who succeeded Sir David English as editor of the Mail in 1992, reportedly held a low opinion of Dempster's column, and revived the 'Ephraim Hardcastle' feature, under the responsibility of Dempster's old colleague on the Eye Peter McKay, in 1996. Dempster retired from editing the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday diaries bearing his name in 2003 and lived with Lady Camilla Dempster, his ex-wife, who helped nurse him through the effects of progressive supranuclear palsy, a nervous disorder with some characteristics of Parkinson's disease.  Personal life  Dempster married, in 1971 (divorced 1974), Countess Emma Magdalen de Bendern, a daughter of Count John Gerard de Bendern and the former Lady Patricia Sybil Douglas. He married Lady Camilla Osborne in 1977 (divorced 2002). She was the former wife of Robert John Brownlow Harris and was the daughter of John Osborne, 11th Duke of Leeds and his second wife, Audrey Young. By his second marriage, Dempster had a stepdaughter, Emily Kate Godolphin Harris (born 1972), and a daughter, Louisa Beatrix Dempster (born 1979). On 29 May 2004 Dempster converted to Roman Catholicism at the Brompton Oratory in London. He had been taking instruction for seven months prior to this and was a regular member of the congregation. Dempster died on 12 July 2007. According to his biographer, Tim Willis: \\"At his funeral, the priest declared that Dempster might have to spend a million years in purgatory — and paused just long enough to shock the congregation, before adding that, in eternity, a million years would pass in the snap of a finger.\\"  References   Books  H.

It ran from 9 January 1971 to 12 March 1994.Copy of the final issue at John's Look-out Briefly in 1985 a BBC-based rival appeared called BEEB; another was launched in 1989, Fast Forward, which went on to outsell Look-in. Format Look-in had interviews, crosswords and competitions, and it had pictures and pin-ups of TV stars and pop idols of the time. Its main feature however was the many comic strips of the favourite children's television programmes, all of which were being shown on the ITV network at the time. When the magazine began publication, it was edited by Alan Fennell and the strips were written by Angus Allan. Fennell left in 1975, and the art editor, Colin Shelborn, took over as editor. The covers in the 1970s were paintings by Arnaldo Putzu, an Italian working in London who had created many cinema posters in the 1960s, including designs for the Carry On films. His Look-in covers were mostly painted using acrylics. Introduced mainly as a vehicle for children to find out what was on ITV, it included highlight listings for each ITV region, of programmes likely to appeal to its target market, but Look-in also spotlighted popular children's topics and pastimes of the day. Skateboarding, BMX and YoYoing were all featured in the magazine. Although primarily a television magazine, it also often featured articles on sport such as On The Ball with Brian Moore, as well as science articles written by Peter Fairley. DJ Ed Stewart became a regular face in Look-in, appearing in the first issue in a feature about a day in his life, he was later given his own pages called 'Stewpot's Newsdesk' which ran until 1980. Alan Fennell who edited Look-in wrote episodes for most of Gerry Anderson's series. After television, the next biggest topic featured was pop music. This usually comprised interview articles and pull-out pin-ups of the top acts of the day, from ABBA and the Bay City Rollers in the 1970s to Adam and the Ants and Bros in the 1980s. Picture strips on pop groups at first featured life stories on ABBA and The Beatles (among others) and went on to become original adventures stories for groups such as Madness and Bucks Fizz. In September 1981 Look-in changed its look, adopting a new logo and with photo covers replacing the cover paintings. By the late 1980s, the comic was struggling to compete with glossier teen magazines and sales were dropping. By the early 1990s, Look-in was catering for a younger age group by featuring picture strip stories based on cartoons and short and choppy fact-file type articles. The final issue was published in 1994. During its run, Look-in annuals and Summer Special issues were released each year. In 2007 Carlton Books published a compilation reprint; Best of the Seventies, under their Prion and Sevenoaks imprints. This was followed-up by a Best of the Eighties the following year.

Boodikka is a tall, well-muscled humanoid alien female with pink skin and reddish black hair. Her name is a play on the ancient British warrior- queen Boudica. Publication history Boodikka first appeared in Green Lantern Vol. 3 #20 and was created by Gerald Jones, Pat Broderick, Romeo Tanghal, Albert De Guzman, and Anthony Tollin. Fictional character biography At three centuries of age, the warrior Boodikka of the planet Bellatrix was originally recruited by the sphere-like Chaselon of Barrio III to join the then-reconstituted Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #20 (January 1992) Boodikka had belonged to something called the \\"Bellatrix Bombers\\", a group of women mercenaries for hire by planets to clear the spaceways of hostile forces. The \\"Bellatrix Bombers\\" had broken up at some point, the majority of the team apparently having been killed along the way. Initially Hal Jordan was dismayed and otherwise put off by Boodikka's inherently aggressive attitude. Despite this, Kilowog, a renowned trainer in the Corps and the trainer of Jordan himself,As shown in Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn was only too eager to train someone so challenging and gave her his recommendation as a candidate. Things moved quickly at this point, and Boodikka soon found herself thrust into battle with Star Sapphire. She and the rest of the Corps joined in the fight against Hal's one-time love, the mercenary Flicker, and an entire Teban convoy.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #23-24 (April–May 1992) Some time later, new recruits of the Green Lantern Corps were shown the Book of Oa, a book kept by the Guardians of the Universe which told tales of Green Lanterns past, present, and future. They learned stories which would help them be better Green Lanterns.Green Lantern Corps Quarterly #1-3 (Summer-Winter 1992) The new members had this training disrupted when they went to Earth to help free Hal Jordan from the influence of the villain Eclipso. They were no match for the eclipsed Jordan and Star Sapphire. Eclipso managed to escape the Corps and soon they returned to Oa. Guy Gardner was awarded a ring by the Guardians of the Universe to act as temporary Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814.Green Lantern Annual (vol. 3) #1 (1992) She would quickly prove to be a skilled power ring wielder, a worthwhile addition to the Green Lantern Corps. Nevertheless, her problem with authority and authority figures posed a continuing problem. She was often at odds with Kreon of Tebis, another new recruit to the Corps. As the former Chieftain of the Teban battle fleet, he was used to discipline and military precision. Their infighting had even jeopardized Oa and the Guardians during a Qwardian invasion. Guy Gardner had returned to Oa to take the yellow power ring of Sinestro. Without Kilowog to guide them, the Green Lanterns were in chaos. Kreon and Boodikka came to blows when the rival Green Lantern criticized her for being an undisciplined fighter. Running out of options, Kilowog brought the two squabbling Green Lanterns to John Stewart as a \\"guest lecturer\\" in cooperation and tolerance. Stewart performed a mind scan on the two recruits and somehow exchanged their consciousnesses. The two Green Lanterns were faced with their ultimate fears: Kreon's was represented by \\"Mama Denata\\" and his fear of the uncontrollable, while Boodikka's fear was \\"the Chain Men\\" which represented the suffocation she felt by authoritative restraints. The two had no choice but to learn to work together or be defeated.Green Lantern: Mosaic #6 (November 1992) Boodikka never lost her love of battle. She eagerly fought against the incarnation of Entropy, even though the encounter then-seemed to mean certain death. Boodikka proved to have come a long way as a Green Lantern, then working as a team with the other members of the Corps to defeat Entropy.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #34-35 (December 1992-January 1993) In a space sector far removed from our own galaxy, Boodikka was assigned to investigate the deaths of multiple alien races that had suddenly destroyed themselves in an apparent mass-suicide, environmental destruction, or otherwise massive wars. Upon arriving on a world in the midst of tearing itself apart, Boodikka encountered Guy Gardner. He and his colleagues, the \\"Gardners of the Universe,\\" had been dispatched to solve the same problem as Boodikka. Guy sought to prove to his leadership abilities to his team of super-powered aliens from across known space. It was not long until Gardner got into an altercation with the Green Lantern. It was during this fight that Guy realized his yellow ring was powered by the energy of the Green Lanterns' power rings.Guy Gardner #9 (June 1993) Fully charged, Gardner's yellow power ring enabled him to recognize the true threat. Created in the anti-matter universe of Qward, his power ring negated the mental block of the real attackers. Gardner used his ring to free the others from their trance. Boodikka's respite would not last long. An alien race called the Ophidians had come to cleanse known space. On two occasions in their sordid past they had been nearly annihilated by alien invaders - then since confining themselves to eradicating all other life in the universe to insure their pseudo-religious quest would never again be in harm's way. The Ophidians would entrance their victims before causing them to fight amongst themselves all the way to extinction. As the Ophidian ship managed to elude them, Boodikka and Gardner had to join their minds together to achieve the speed needed to overtake them. When they reached the ship, it exploded. Whether this was a result of feedback from the two fighting off the mind control or self- destruction, is unknown. The pair now had no way to find the Ophidian's homeworld. After the battle, Boodikka called upon the Guardians of the Universe to consult in the matter of recovering Gardner's Qwardian power ring. The Guardians, however, had determined Gardner was working toward the same ends they were. Although they would be watching Gardner, they decided not to act on Gardner for the time being.Guy Gardner #10 (July 1993) A fierce warrior, Boodikka was well-versed in many combative arts including the use of short-swords, handguns, and explosives. Often she would visit her own mother for combat. On Bellatrix, this was considered a good time. Boodikka's own grandmother had been killed by her own daughter. Arisia, a former Green Lantern of Graxos IV and onetime love of Hal Jordan, told this story to Justice Leaguers Power Girl, Doctor Light, and Maya when they inquired about women in the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern Corps Quarterly #6 (Fall 1993) At one point the Green Lantern Corps were called upon to help Hal Jordan on the planet Maltus. He had been fighting the Maltusian gods known as the Triarch and was also under attack by the Darkstars and the L.E.G.I.O.N. Boodikka was as smitten by the fighting prowess of Lobo, bounty hunter and L.E.G.I.O.N. operative. The two stopped in mid-fight and went \\"somewhere\\" at Lobo's suggestion for a formidable love-making session that caused the two of them to miss the entire fight.Darkstars #11 (August 1993)L.E.G.I.O.N. #58 (September 1993)Green Lantern (vol. 3) #45 (September 1993)DC Universe: Trinity #2 (September 1993) Boodikka eventually became a kind of recruiter for the Corps. In her search she encountered Barin, a young soldier of a kindred warrior species who she believed would prove to be an asset to her brethren. As events would turn out, Barin was not quite at a point where he was ready to fight solo. Upon his first outing alone he was quickly besieged by a kind of space mongrels and went into shock. The would-be Lantern was brought to Oa where he was connected to life support systems. Since the destruction of Oa by both the Parallax-ridden Hal Jordan and its resurrection by Kyle Rayner, Barin's ultimate fate remains unknown.Green Lantern Corps Quarterly #7 (Winter 1993)Green Lantern (vol. 3) #0 (October 1994) =Emerald Twilight and beyond= Her next mission was to stop Hal Jordan from reaching Oa during Emerald Twilight by the direct order of the Guardians of the Universe. Although she fought well, she was no match for Jordan's willpower. Because she was unwilling to give up her ring freely, Jordan severed Boodikka's hand to take her ring from it. Jordan left her floating in space and continued on towards Oa where he would soon become Parallax.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #49 (February 1994) Jordan later mentioned that he had left Boodikka, along with the other Green Lanterns he had confronted on the way to Oa, with \\"enough power to survive\\" even after taking their rings.Green Lantern (vol. 3) #50 (March 1994) Later it was revealed that Boodikka had survived, joining \\"The Brotherhood of the Cold Flame\\" on the planet Xudar with other former Green Lanterns to find the means to atone for the crimes of Hal Jordan. The Brotherhood of the Cold flame, using the spirit of the deceased Kilowog, created the \\"Dark Lantern,\\" an instrument of their vengeance against Boodikka's wishes.Green Lantern: Legacy - The Last Will & Testament of Hal Jordan (2002) Boodikka was later discovered by Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner on the Manhunter homeworld of Biot, in a state of suspended animation with other \\"Lost Lanterns\\" Jordan had left for dead during Emerald Twilight. At some point in time the Manhunters, in concert with Hank Henshaw, had gathered up these former Green Lanterns, put them into suspended animation, and used their energies as a battery to create more advanced Manhunters. Upon being freed from her slumber Boodikka seemed shocked that she no longer had her hand, and following commentary implied her last conscious memory was of fighting the Parallax-possessed Hal Jordan despite having lived some time after her maiming on Xudar as part of the \\"Brotherhood of the Cold Flame\\".Green Lantern (vol. 4) #3 (August 2005)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #11 (May 2006)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #12 (July 2006) How or why Boodikka was captured while on Xudar (assuming she still remained there) remains unknown. During the confrontation with the Manhunters, Kreon dies and his ring chooses Boodikka.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #13 (September 2006) She resumes her duties in the Green Lantern Corps, replacing her lost hand with an emerald one fueled by her Power Ring energies. Boodikka and her fellow Lost Lanterns keep their distance from Hal Jordan until Parallax (in the form of Kyle Rayner) brings him to Qward. They followed, knowing that \\"The Corps doesn't abandon its own\\".Green Lantern (vol. 4) #21 (July 2007) When Parallax killed Chance, she attempted to vaporise him, which her ring recognised as an illegal action, consequently shutting down, leaving her helpless. Boodikka then went with Ke'Haan and Laira to find Ion, deep beneath Qward.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #22 (August 2007) Instead, they run into the Anti-Monitor. Ke'Haan was killed, but the others managed to rescue Ion, and return to Oa. At the same time, the Guardians had rewritten the Book of Oa, allowing Lanterns to use lethal force, returning control of the ring to Boodikka.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #23 (September 2007) =Post-Sinestro Corps War= Boodikka as an Alpha Lantern Boodikka became a member of the Alpha Lanterns, an internal policing force within the Corps itself, soon after the Sinestro War and the enactment of the Second Law of the Book of Oa. The Alpha Lanterns make sure that no Corps member performs an illegal action using a power ring. Each Alpha Lantern receives a second power ring and receives direct connections to the Book of Oa's Laws and the Central Power Battery. The process involves surgical alteration into a hybrid of the individual recruit's biological form and updated Manhunter technology. In other words, Alpha Lanterns are cyborgs.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #26 (December 2007)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #27 (January 2008)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #28 (March 2008) Boodikka and the Alpha Lanterns are seen in Final Crisis. Fellow Alpha Lantern Kraken is revealed to be taken over by Granny Goodness during Hal Jordan's trial after the Alphas had arrested Hal for the murder of Orion.Final Crisis #1-5 (July–December 2008) =Brightest Day= Alpha Lantern Boodikka is shown to have been controlled by Cyborg Superman.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #49 (June 2010) As she attacks Kyle Rayner, Soranik Natu, and John Stewart, Green Lantern member Hannu ambushes her and manages to damage her severely. This temporarily frees her from Cyborg Superman's control and she instructs the other Lanterns to recharge the battery with the energy she has absorbed.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #51 (August 2010) Her fellow Lanterns are able to repair her enough for her to fight, and she joins in the attack on the Cyborg Superman's base. During the battle, the Cyborg's body is destroyed, and his consciousness attempts to take control of Boodikka's body. Boodikka's consciousness fights back, defeating him. On her return to Oa, Boodikka is made a member of the Lantern Honor Guard, her emotions restored due to the way she was freed from the Cyborg's control. However, Ganthet noted immediately that there was something different about her. Boodikka asserts this is because Ganthet's newly discovered emotions allowed her to be who she is (Boodikka's true self, now in control of her body again), not what she is (an Alpha Lantern).Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #52 (September 2010) =Reign of Doomsday= Boodikka later appears at the remains of the destroyed planet New Krypton, where she encounters Batman and Supergirl of the Justice League. Boodikka explains that the Guardians had sent her on a mission to survey the ruins as a follow-up to the initial Green Lantern Corps inspection of the planet that took place during the World of New Krypton storyline. Suddenly, the heroes are attacked by Doomsday, who strikes Boodikka across the back before she has a chance to react. Due to her injuries, Boodikka is unable to effectively wield her ring, and is nearly captured by the creature before being rescued by Supergirl. With Starman and Saint Walker of the Blue Lantern Corps serving as a distraction, Batman and Supergirl are able to get the injured Boodikka to the JLA Watchtower. Doomsday follows them aboard, and just as he is about to attack them, Cyborg Superman emerges from Boodikka's body and states that Doomsday attacked Boodikka and the JLA members in order to get to him.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #55 After Doomsday captures Supergirl and Cyborg Superman and then flees the Watchtower, Starman mentions that Boodikka is healing herself in the JLA medical facility, and that she should soon have enough energy to return to Oa.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #56 Following the War of the Green Lanterns storyline, Boodikka and the Alpha Lanterns are killed by Alpha Lantern Varix that believe that the Alpha Lanterns are being corrupted into judgement against John Stewart during his trial; Varix then killed himself. Afterwards, the bodies of Alpha Lanterns were interned on Oa.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 3) #12 (August 2012) In other media =Television= Boodikka appears briefly in the Duck Dodgers episode \\"The Green Loontern\\" as one of the Lanterns defending Oa from Sinestro, voiced by Grey DeLisle. She is later rescued by Dodgers and the rest of the Corps. * Boodikka makes a cameo in Justice League Action in Season 1, Episode 47 \\"Watchtower Tours\\". =Film= Boodikka appears in Green Lantern: First Flight voiced by Tricia Helfer. This version of Boodikka is radically different from her comic version, in that she is a co-conspirator with Sinestro. In a fight with Hal Jordan and Kilowog, she is killed when impaled after an explosion with her shooting Kanjar Ro's energy staff. * Boodikka has a cameo appearance in Green Lantern: Emerald Knights, reprised by Grey DeLisle who was uncredited for the role. * Boodikka also appears in the live-action Green Lantern film in a cameo in a few scenes in the film. Although she is very similar to humans in appearance in the comics, no actress was cast for the role and CGI was used instead, to portray her.

Vasalis (1983) M. Vasalis, pseudonym for Margaretha (Kiekie) Droogleever Fortuyn-Leenmans (13 February 1909 in The Hague - 16 October 1998 in Roden) was a Dutch poet and psychiatrist.  The pseudonym  'Vasalis' is a Latinization of her last name 'Leenmans'. The 'M' does not stand for 'Maria' as is sometimes incorrectly reported. The poetess initially wanted to publish her work without revealing that her poems were written by a woman. When, through Simon Vestdijk (a Dutch novelist), she had the chance to make her debut in the literary magazine 'Groot Nederland', they did not allow her to sign her work with merely her initials, the poetess decided to write and publish under a pseudonym. Since her father had written and published under the name 'Vazal' while he was a student, she decided to play with this Latin translation of her last name, which resulted in Vasalis.  Life and work  Vasalis grew up in the outskirts of Scheveningen, a Dutch city by the sea. Margaretha Leenmans (Kiekie or Kiek for friends) studied medicine and anthropology at Leiden University. She was a member of the sorority 'Zestigpoot', which means 'sixty legs'. They named themselves after the fifteen members and their four limbs (15x4). The crown princess Juliana was also a member. They re-wrote the fairytale about Bluebeard into a new theater play that was performed by the members of the sorority. Leenmans had the part of Bluebeard and Juliana that of the wife.[3] After her education, in 1939 she settled in Amsterdam to work as a medical doctor. Later she worked as a psychiatrist for children in Assen and Groningen (the Netherlands). During the thirties, she befriended J.C. Bloem, Adriaan Roland Holst, Albert van Dalsum, Victor van Vriesland, Titus Leeser and many others at the 'salon artistique' hosted by the lawyer Harro Bouman and his wife Carina Bouman- Hofstede Crull. It was in 1939 that she married Jan Droogleever Fortuyn, who was to become a professor in neurology. In 1940, Vasalis made her debut with the bundle 'Parken en woestijnen' which translates to 'parks and deserts'. Other works of poetry are 'De vogel Phoenix' (1947) and 'Vergezichten en gezichten' (1954). The three poetry bundles that were published during her lifetime, only contained about one hundred poems.[4] Posthumously, 'De oude kustlijn' appeared in 2002. Her children Lous, Hal and Maria Droogleever Fortuyn took care of this publication, as she had asked them. Vasalis wrote tradional poems that were characterized by the use of personification and anthropomorphism. Her poems often consist of several impressions of nature, then ending in a self-reflection. Besides poems, Vasalis also wrote various essays and a novella. Her work has been frequently awarded, with, amongst others, the prestigious Constantijn Huygensprize in 1974 and the P.C. Hooft- prize in 1982. Ton Anbeek, a Dutch writer and literary scientist, described her poems as: \\"Seemingly banal facts that may lead to a flash of insight\\". Considered as one of her most well known poems is 'Afsluitdijk' from Parken en woestijnen (1940). When her husband became a professor at the University of Groningen they moved there with the family in 1951. Vasalis lived in 'house de Zulthe' nearby the village of Roden from 1964 until her passing away in 1998.  Hommage  There is a bed&breakfast; in 'house de Zulthe' in Roden, the Netherlands, the house where Vasalis lived during the last part of her life. Also, there is talk of the construction of a special Vasalis garden in her last place of residence. In 2009 a memorial was placed in honour of her 100th anniversary. Also, in Leiden, on the corner of the Lijsterstraat and the Leeuwerikstraat, a bronze portrait of Vasalis can be found. The sculpture was made b the artist Aart Schonk. Vasalis lived here during the years of her medical education (from 1927 until 1934). The portrait was placed on the initiative of the Society of Dutch Literature, after the Vasalis-biography by Maaike Meijer. Maijer created the biography with the help of her descendants, but it was said to be with done with caution as Vasalis had always protected her identity and her privacy during her lifetime. Lastly, a train from the Dutch company Arriva also carries the name M. Vasalis. Works Poem by Vasalis on a wall in The Hague 1940 - Onweer, in Drie Novellen, met J. Campert en E.

The method was written with the early romantic guitar in mind (Sor mentions some 19th-century guitar-builders: J. Panormo, Schroeder of Petersburg, Alonso of Madrid, Pages and Benitez of Cadiz, Joseph and Manuel Martinez of Malaga, Rada, and Lacôte of Paris), but it is not only about instrumental technique, but also includes details about the theory of scales, harmony, sonority, composition, and above all music as an art. French and German edition Méthode pour la guitare The first edition was in French and appeared in Paris in 1830 with the title of '.Méthode pour la guitare par Ferdinand Sor (1830), Biblioteca Nacional de España Brian Jeffery (the modern publisher of A. Merrick's old English translation) mentions: \\"It is the only version known to have Sor's direct authority. Now extremely rare, it was never reprinted; indeed, an early biographer of Sor (Baltasar Saldoni in his Diccionario de Efemérides de Músicos Españoles, I, Madrid, 1868) says (he does not state on what authority) that Sor destroyed the plates.\\" During the same period Simrock in Bonn had brought out a parallel French and German edition.Méthode pour la guitare = Guitarre-Schule (Bonn: N. Simrock, 1831) English edition The English edition is a translation from the original in French made by A. Merrick, the organist of Cirencester, and published in London by Cocks & Co. probably in 1832, as Method for the Spanish Guitar.Method for the Spanish Guitar, Biblioteca Nacional de España The French and German versions do not carry the word \\"Spanish\\" in the title. This version is today available from Brian Jeffery's.Fernando Sor – Method for the Spanish Guitar (1832) , Tecla Editions Brian Jeffery mentions: \\"Later in the century, in 1897, Frank Mott Harrison published in London a Method for the Guitar by Ferdinando Sor,http://www.muslib.se/ebibliotek/boije/pdf/Boije%201140.pdf a work of small value which says (of course wrongly) that the original was written in Spanish.\\" Coste's adapted and augmented version After Sor's death, Napoléon Coste, one of his pupils, published a revision of the original called '.http://www2.kb.dk/elib/noder/rischel/RiBS0789.pdf alt. Matanya Ophee states that in Coste's revised and augmented version, there is an introduction which is helpful in better understanding Sor, and some of the circumstances under which Sor wrote the original method. Brian Jeffery controversially regards Coste's version somewhat negatively (\\"travesty of the original ... bears little resemblance to the original\\"), even though the title immediately makes it clear, that it is not the original, but was adapted and augmented by Coste (augmented incidentally, with numerous pieces of high quality). Today Coste's version is highly regarded in its own right (the title mentioning of Sor, possibly being more a sign of respect, than what Jeffery has termed \\"a disservice to his friend's memory\\"). Ophee has written: \\"He [Coste] is certainly not hostile to Sor and to his memory\\". Various details In the method (in plate VII, example 27), Sor quotes bars 22 to 25 of Sonata Op. 35, No. 1 by Jan Ladislav Dussek; mentioning \\"that the celebrated Düssek had the texture of the orchestra in view when he wrote for the pianoforte the passage in example twenty-seventh, plate VII.\\" References External linksSeven years of the King's theatre by John Ebers; published by Carey, Lea & Carey, 1828 *Bibliographie de la France by Adrien-Jean-Quentin Beuchot, Cercle de la librairie (France); publisher: Au Cercle de la Librairie, 1851 *Recensionen: Guitarre-Schule von Ferdinand Sor, Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung; published by Breitkopf & Härtel, 1832 *Diccionario biográfico- bibliográfico de efemérides de músicos españoles by Baltasar Saldoni Category:Guitar études Category:Music education Category:Compositions by Fernando Sor Category:1830 compositions ","title":"Méthode pour la Guitare"},{"id":"5990509","text":"Daniel Wasson (born June 15, 1984) is an American soccer player who last played for Tulsa Athletic in the National Premier Soccer League.

It was constructed adjacent to the Detroit Trust Company Building, designed by Albert Kahn in 1915, as offices for the Detroit Bank and Trust Company, later known as Comerica. The bank occupied space in the building until 1993, when it moved to One Detroit Center. In the courtyard between the two buildings is a sculpture based on the bank's logo at the time. The building currently houses offices for the Detroit Economic Club, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the United States Attorney and several other tenants. Architecture The building was designed in the International style by renowned architects Harley, Ellington, Cowin & Stirton in 1961. Tinted windows set into precast concrete frames create a unique grid pattern along the sweeping building façade. The building's address \\"211\\" is displayed along the roof line.

The ride takes place on city streets, has no sponsors, is not sanctioned by any government agency, and does not require registration or membership in a club. The ride follows different routes each month, generally between long. Traditionally, the ride has taken place on the second Friday of every month at about 10:00 PM from a starting point in Echo Park; however, the surge of popularity it has enjoyed in recent years has made it possible for rides to occur much more frequently and in diverse parts of the city. If the ride passes through downtown Los Angeles it is traditional for the route to include the 2nd Street Tunnel.  History  Midnight Ridazz began in February, 2004 when six cyclists and two skateboarders in Echo Park took an impromptu tour of the fountains in downtown Los Angeles. The idea of taking a monthly late night group bicycle ride to see interesting and unusual aspects of Los Angeles not ordinarily accessible or meaningfully experienced from an automobile spread quickly by word of mouth, and within several months the group grew to over five times its original size. Before the ride celebrated its first anniversary in February 2005, the monthly turnout had swollen to well over a hundred riders. As the ride grew, the social and organizational dynamic changed. What had started out as a small gathering of friends had become first a neighborhood and then a citywide phenomenon. Several of the original riders voluntarily took on the responsibility of planning routes, printing route slips for distribution to participants, inventing themes for the rides and publicizing them, and helping riders with mechanical difficulties along the way. By the summer of 2006, Midnight Ridazz had grown to such an extent that often more than a thousand riders could be expected to show up at the traditional meeting point in the parking lot of the Pioneer Chicken fast-food restaurant on Echo Park Avenue off of Sunset Boulevard. The rapid growth of the ride was beginning to overwhelm the neighborhood where riders met, and perhaps more importantly, it was beginning to overwhelm the organizers. The ride had grown unwieldy; riders were getting lost, altercations and accidents involving riders and frustrated motorists were becoming common, and it was no longer practical to stop the ride to wait for participants with mechanical problems. The organizers' response to this was to step down and allow responsibility for the rides to devolve to the participants, and to encourage splitting Midnight Ridazz from one large monthly ride into several more frequent regional rides. The transition worked remarkably well, due at least in part to the advent of a Midnight Ridazz website with a discussion forum and a ride calendar open to anybody who wished to organize and announce a group ride.  Culture and ethic  Midnight Ridazz is rooted in a punk ethos. It was partly the aim of the original riders and organizers to challenge both the dominant means of transportation and the prevailing mode of entertainment in Los Angeles, a city largely designed around the private automobile and one in which weekend entertainment is widely assumed to involve some kind of commercial transaction. Midnight Ridazz and its most prominent promoters do not overtly claim to be engaging in activism, apart from taking the position that \\"riding a bicycle in this country in and of itself IS the political act.\\" Ridazz bears some resemblance to the pro- bicycle Critical Mass phenomenon in that both involve large groups of cyclists temporarily taking over city streets in public view. However, it is distinct from Critical Mass in that the routes are planned by self-appointed caretakers, and the atmosphere revolves around party culture and fun rather than political demonstration. Inclusiveness has long been a dominant cultural component in Midnight Ridazz. Rides are usually planned and paced so as to allow any reasonably healthy adult with a roadworthy bicycle and the ability to ride it to participate. Accordingly, the rides have attracted a wide cross- section of the cycling community in Los Angelesbicycle messengers, bicycle commuters, utility cyclists, fixed gear enthusiasts, recreational riders, racers, and so on—although the convergence of different groups of cyclists has not been without occasional friction. Midnight Ridazz has inspired many new regular rides and bicycle groups in the Los Angeles area and has been credited with helping to popularize bicycle ride culture in Los Angeles.  The Annual All City Toy Ride  Since December 2006 the Midnight Ridazz have hosted The All City Toy Ride. The charity bicycle ride traditionally takes place on the second Friday in December. Participants are asked to bring a toy up to $25 in value to be donated to a local charity. Past charities to receive toys from the event include The Los Angeles Department of Child Services, The Los Angeles Fire Department's: Spark of Love, The Alliance for Children's Rights, Los Angeles Legal Aid and the East LA Women's Center. The event consists of several rides, each originating for different parts of Los Angeles County.

It also includes companies, public service agencies, voluntary organisations and community groups with a common interest in developing the economy of the Greater Nottingham area to the benefit of all. Over the years, the GNP has expanded to include the business, public, voluntary and community sectors, giving birth to the four sector model. It now has a forum of 24 people, representing a broad range of organisations working across the Greater Nottingham area. The East Midlands Development Agency (EMDA) contacted the GNP to discuss the delivery of the government's regeneration agenda across Greater Nottingham.

Life  Pfaff was capped seven times between 1953 and 1956 for the West German national team, scoring two goals as an inside forward. The highlight of his career was winning the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland. Pfaff had an appearance in the preliminary round against Hungary (3–8) and scored a goal in the 26th minute. His club was Eintracht Frankfurt with whom he won the 1959 German Championship, and in 1960 reached the finals of Champion's Cup against Real Madrid. The left-footed Don Alfredo was the head of the team. Pfaff was a true playmaker with exceptionally good ball control and great skills at free kicks. Pfaff probably would have accumulated more than seven caps if Fritz Walter had not played the same role for West Germany as Pfaff played for Eintracht Frankfurt. In 1954, Atlético Madrid offered him 180,000 D-Mark but his wife Edith was against a move to Spain.Bitter, Jürgen. Deutschlands Fußball Nationalspieler, Sportverlag, 1997, p. 504. Possibly Pfaff's greatest game was the 6–1 against Rangers F.C. in the 1959–60 semifinal first leg of the European Champion Clubs' Cup, which was followed by a 6–3 win of Eintracht Frankfurt in Glasgow in the second leg. He ended his career in 1962 at the age of 36. Besides his sports career, Pfaff was an innkeeper and had a bar near the Hauptwache in Frankfurt. Since the 1960s, he lived as a barkeeper and hotel keeper in Zittenfelden in Morretal, Odenwald.

Office of Illinois State Treasurer. 22 December 2009. Eligible accountholders who lost money in Core Plus would receive $77 million from OppenheimerFunds. As the scope of the settlement was expanded during negotiations with OppenheimerFunds to include more accountholders, the total loss addressed by the settlement is $150 million. The payout from this settlement brings the losses for the 2.5% of Bright Start investors who were fully invested in Core Plus down to 17%. The Treasurer's Office used some of the investment fees from the Bright Start program to purchase a hybrid vehicle \\"so Bright Start staff have a way to travel the state and sign families up for the program\\" and used to promote other Treasurer's Office programs.

State plans ‘virtual yard sale’ of unclaimed property August 14, 2007  Broadway Bank  From 2002 to 2006, Giannoulias worked as a senior loan officer and vice president at Broadway Bank, a community bank founded by his father. When he left the bank in 2006, it was one of the most profitable banks in Illinois. Four years later, on January 26, 2010, Broadway Bank entered into a consent decree with the FDIC that ordered Broadway to increase its capital. Two dozen small- to medium-sized banks in Illinois and nearly 200 banks nationwide have failed since the October 2008 economic crash.Failed Bank List. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Broadway Bank's struggling financial situation is due to delinquent real estate loans and foreclosed properties. From 2002 to 2006, Broadway's lending in construction and development loans increased sixfold, to $356 million. During Giannoulias' tenure, Broadway also increased its brokered deposits, which generally command high interest rates. When Giannoulias left the bank in 2006, brokered deposits made up 80% of all deposits at Broadway. When the housing market crashed in late 2008, commercial real estate loan performance deteriorated and Broadway Bank, which had focused its lending in real estate, suffered. Nine percent of the value of the bad loans originated while Giannoulias was chief loan officer.:1 At the end of business on Friday, , the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, Division of Banking, seized Broadway Bank and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. The FDIC in turn named MB Financial Bank as the institution receiving Broadway Bank's deposit accounts. The FDIC announced that it and MB Financial Bank would share $878.4 million in losses, for a cost of $394.3 million to the federal Deposit Insurance Fund. = Loans made by Broadway Bank = Broadway Bank made real estate development loans to Tony Rezko, a political fundraiser and real estate developer who was later convicted of fraud and money laundering. Broadway Bank made these loans before Rezko was investigated, indicted, or convicted for any crimes. Before his conviction, Rezko also received loans from other Chicago banks, including Bank of Chicago, First Bank and Trust of Illinois, GE Capital, Harris Trust and Savings, LaSalle Bank, and Manufacturers Bank. Giannoulias himself did not make the Rezko loans.Sweet, Lynn. Dems at risk of losing Obama's old Senate seat. Chicago Sun-Times. 15 November 2009.

J. Cook. Kimberly serves as the protagonist of Final Destination 2. She is a college student from White Plains, New York, and is one of the survivors of the Route 23 pileup. Kimberly remains the only known visionary of the series to successfully cheat Death. Character arc =Background= Kimberly was born in White Plains, New York to Michael Corman. She is very close to her father, especially after her mother's death during a carjacking. Kimberly continues to blame herself for what happened since she stayed behind from her mother in an appliance store to watch a newsfeed about Tod Waggner's suicide. Her mother was shot in their car when it was hijacked by street thugs. She is attending college with her friends Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez and Frankie Whitman, and was originally going to spend her spring break with her friends in Daytona Beach, Florida. A.J. Cook, famous for portraying Jennifer \\"JJ\\" Jareau in the TV series Criminal Minds, played Kimberly Corman in Final Destination 2. Cook's role is one of the current five visionaries of the series, the other four (Alex Browning, Wendy Christensen, Nick O'Bannon, and Sam Lawton) portrayed by Devon Sawa, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Bobby Campo, and Nicholas D'Agosto respectively. =Final Destination 2= In the film, Kimberly decided to take Route 23 as a shortcut to Florida. While driving, Kim had an ominous vision of a highway pileup caused by a log truck derailment at the end of the vision a mysterious truck coming out of nowhere rams into her car. Stalling her car sideways to prevent other drivers from going further, Kim and a handful of other drivers watches closely as vehicles ahead crash one another and explode in the highway. To her surprise, another truck (the same truck that killed her at the end of her vision) smashes her SUV with her friends still in it, killing them, although she is rescued by Officer Burke. Kimberly and other survivors are interrogated by Officer Burke afterwards, with Kimberly explaining her vision's similarity to Alex Browning's vision, and that now they are all in Death's List. The survivors disregard this until survivor Evan Lewis died in his apartment later that night, alarming everyone of Death being after them. With Burke's help, Kimberly consult the help of Clear Rivers (the only survivor of Flight 180 that time) to save the remaining others. Nevertheless, their attempts prove unsuccessful. Clear leads Kimberly and Officer Burke to mortician William Bludworth, who helps the latter by claiming that new life can defeat Death. Kimberly realizes that pregnant survivor Isabella Hudson can save them; however, this proves false, since Isabella was meant to live even in the premonition. After two more deaths, Kimberly sacrifices herself for Officer Burke's safety by driving the van she is riding into a lake, but Officer Burke rescues her from the van and sends her to the nearby hospital for recovery. Thinking she and Officer Burke finally cheated Death, they went to a picnic with the Gibbons family, who tells them how their son Brian Gibbons was saved from Death by the survivors. To everyone's surprise, Brian is blown to pieces nearby due to a barbecue grill malfunction. =Final Destination 3 alternate ending= In the alternate ending of Final Destination 3, a newspaper (not official) blows by, revealing Kimberly and Burke ran into each other at a hardware store and a Camaro (belonging to Evan) ran through the store, knocking them into a nearby woodchipper (belonging to Peter Gibbons). Kimberly's coat was tangled and was snatched into the machine. Burke attempted to save her, and both were dismembered, with the attending physician who signed their death certificates being Dr. Ellen Kalarjian. However, while this is an alternate ending, as every other character in the Final Destination series has died, it can be safely assumed that they too faced a gruesome end. Franchise producer Craig Perry had stated that the newspaper article can be taken as canonical. Casting The role of Kimberly Corman was given to Canadian actress A. J. Cook, who previously starred in the 1999 film The Virgin Suicides. Cook described her role as \\"a very strong girl, very determined because her mother died a year earlier, right in front of her eyes, so she’s had to grow up quick.\\" Cook added that \\"it's rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film, not to mention two [Larter].” Director David Ellis and producer Craig Perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance, and she was hired instantly. Ellis and Perry praised her act, with Perry stating that \\"[they] were at the beginning of what's going to be a long successful career for her.\\" Ellis describe her role as \\"a girl who can have some fun cause they're going on a trip and they'll gonna have a good time, yet someone who can stand up to Clear, to come and challenge Clear on a race, and to bother with Clear.\\" The character's surname was based by writer Jeffrey Reddick to American director Roger Corman, who directed the horror comedy film The Little Shop of Horrors. Originally, Kimberly and her father Michael's surname was \\"Burroughs\\" (in honor of Canadian actress Jackie Burroughs, who starred as Kate Flynn in the acclaimed crime thriller film The Grey Fox) instead of Corman in the original script, but the writers decided to change it in the script revision. Reception Cook's performance met mixed reviews among critics. Robert Koehler of Variety said that \\"the giddy sequences also help in getting past the generally awful thesping, led by Cook, whose blurry grasp of emotions betrays Ellis' apparent disinterest in his actors.\\" David Grove of Film Threat panned Cook's acting, stating that \\"she’s no great actress, but she’s a real looker\\" and teased that \\"since when did a horror movie suffer from having two dumb blondes as leads\\", the other actress referring to Larter.\\" Dustin Putman of TheMovieBoy.com commented about Cook's emotional scenes: > Taking over where Devon Sawa's Alex took off, A. J. Cook (2001's Out Cold) > is serviceable as the premonition-fueled Kimberly, but doesn't evoke enough > emotion in the scenes following the brutal deaths of her close friends. Nevertheless, Robin Clifford of Reeling Reviews stated that \\"Cook was strident as the catalyst that sparks events with her premonitions of disaster and her fervent desire to cheat the Reaper.\\" Brett Gallman of Oh, The Horror! claimed that Cook and fellow actor Michael Landes were \\"serviceable as leads.\\" References Category:Fictional characters with precognition Category:Final Destination characters Category:Film characters introduced in 2003 Category:Fictional characters from New York (state) Category:Final girls ","title":"Kimberly Corman"},{"id":"5990691","text":"thumb Balchik by Ghiață Dumitru Ghiață (22 September 1888 – 3 July 1972) was a Romanian landscape painter.

The character, created by James Wong and Glen Morgan, and portrayed by actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, serves as the protagonist in Final Destination 3. Outside of the films, the character also appears in the novelization of Final Destination 3. In the film, Wendy is depicted a high school graduate from the fictional town of McKinley in Pennsylvania, and is one of the survivors of the Devil's Flight roller coaster derailment. The character is portrayed in the film as an emotional, obsessive-compulsive \\"control freak\\" who becomes increasingly distressed over the course of the film as she fails to save the lives of those around her. Although her fate at the end of the film remains ambiguous, it's implied that she is the tenth and final survivor to die. Additionally, in 2011, franchise producer Craig Perry stated that he \\"believes\\" both Wendy and her sister Julie are, in fact, dead. Both the character and Winstead's performance were positively received by critics, often being singled out as one of the highlights of the film, even by its detractors. Appearances =Final Destination 3= Wendy lived in McKinley, Pennsylvania, with her sister Julie Christensen. She was shown to be a control freak. She was dating Jason Wise, and was friends with Kevin Fischer and Carrie Dreyer. She was the school photographer for the yearbook. Wendy and her friends celebrated at the amusement park for their senior field trip. At the start of the film, Wendy admits that she doesn't care for Kevin, but as the movie goes on she slowly forms a caring relationship with Kevin. Before boarding a roller coaster ride known as \\"Devil's Flight\\", Wendy began to have the feeling of \\"having no control\\". Shortly after being seated on the coaster, she suffered a premonition of the entire ride derailing and brutally killing her and all the other passengers. She panicked, and managed to get several of her fellow students off, before realizing her boyfriend Jason and best friend Carrie were still on the roller coaster. She fails to get them off the ride in time and witnesses the derailment of the roller coaster and the death of Jason and Carrie. After the incident, she is determined to leave McKinley due to the bad memories. When she begins noticing the photographs she took on the night of the roller coaster ride carry ominous clues as to how the other survivors eventually meet their end and also learned details of the Flight 180 disaster from Kevin beforehand, she then pairs up with him to save the other survivors; she ends up only managing to rescue Ian, her sister Julie and Kevin from their second intended deaths. Shortly after, Ian confronts Wendy, Kevin, and Julie; he blames Wendy for Erin's death and is determined to ensure that she will not survive. Fireworks behind Wendy nearly hit her, but she avoided them and thus escapes her second death. However, they hit a nearby cherry picker and it collapses and kills Ian. Wendy, Kevin, and Julie believe they have managed to escape death, but five months later, Wendy sees signs relating to the events of both the roller coaster and the Flight 180 disasters, and senses something is wrong. During a chance reunion with Julie and Kevin, she receives another premonition that foretells their deaths in the subway crash. Her attempts to stop the subway are for naught, as the film cuts to black, with sounds of the train derailment being heard, just as she runs towards the exit door leaving her fate ambiguous. According to Winstead, the character is not dead: \\"I didn't die. Or rather, it's open to debate.\\" Alternate endings Three alternate endings result in different fates for Wendy. In the first alternate ending on the DVD, after Ian gets completely crushed, she along with Kevin and Julie leave the tricentennial, but not before the camera which Wendy threw to the ground takes one last picture of them, presumably hinting their next way of death. In another ending, Wendy did not receive the second premonition and the film ends with the subway barreling straight into her, explicitly showing her death. In the final alternate ending, Wendy receives her vision before she boarded the roller coaster, and manages to save herself along with Kevin, Jason, and Carrie. =Final Destination 5= In the fifth installment of the Final Destination franchise, Wendy appears through archive footage. =Literature= Wendy appears in the novelization of Final Destination 3. The storyline follows the same one as the film but in the novel Wendy survives. Casting and creation In a DVD feature, James Wong revealed that he originally intended for Wendy to be a \\"perky blonde\\" and that Alexis Bledel had auditioned for the role. Winstead, who got cast in March 2005, had previously auditioned for the second film, won the role because she brought emotion and character that impressed Wong and Morgan. When asked if she was a fan of the Final Destination franchise prior to being cast in the third film, Winstead mentioned auditioning for the second film saying, \\"Definitely. I was a fan of both films. I auditioned for the second one, but didn’t make it. I was happy to get a shot here\\". Wong described Wendy as being \\"deeply affected by the accident, but she’s strong, and fights to maintain control.\\" Reception Wendy has received a positive reception from critics. Winstead's performance was met with generally positive reception among critics. James Berardinelli says she \\"does as competent a job as one could expect in these dire circumstances.\\" Felix Gonzalez, Jr. speaks positively of Winstead's and Merriman's performances, saying \\"the film is not entirely unwatchable.

Vitale was a \\"man of honour\\" or member of the Altarello di Baida cosca or family, Altarello being a small village just outside Palermo. Background In 1960, at the age of 19, Vitale was affiliated to the clan mafia of Altarello, which was led by his uncle said Giovanbattista \\"Titta\\". Vitale carried out extortions of construction companies on the orders of his uncle and his associate Giuseppe Calò, later being promoted to capodecina. In 1972, Vitale was arrested on suspicion of being implicated in the kidnapping of the manufacturer Luciano Cassina, but was released after a week of isolation in the prison of Asinara. Whilst held in custody, he had showed signs of depression that led to coprophagia and practiced self mutilation as his own act of contrition; doctors subjected him to electroconvulsive therapy. On 29 March 1973, Vitale walked into a Palermo police station and declared that he was a member of the Mafia and confessed to various acts of extortion, arson and two homicides.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 92 In front of police officers he explained how a Mafia family is organised and revealed the existence of the Sicilian Mafia Commission, more than a decade before Tommaso Buscetta exposed Mafia secrets to judges who were prepared to listen.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, pp. 265-268 In explaining why he had turned himself in, something that was unheard of from a mafioso at that point, Vitale claimed to have had a spiritual crisis and wanted to unburden himself. In 1977, Vitale's testimony led to 28 defendants being indicted, all of which were acquitted due to lack of evidence and the doubt surrounding Vitale's mental state by pointing out his erratic behaviour, except for himself and his uncle who were imprisoned. While testifying against his fellow Mafiosi, Vitale reminisced about his life: \\"I have made a fool of my life, by the evil that has rained on me from the time I was a child... My sin was having being born into a Mafia family and of having lived in a society where everyone is a Mafioso and are respected for it; while those who are not are treated with contempt.\\"Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 176Jonathan White, Italy: The Enduring Culture, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, , Google Print, p. 268 Vitale spent most of his time in a mental asylum, before being released in June 1984. On 2 December 1984, he was shot dead as he left a church after attending Mass with his mother and sister.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 150 Legacy Later in 1984, Tommaso Buscetta became an informant and gave a vast amount of information on the Mafia in Sicily that subsequently backed up a lot of Vitale's own testimony. Vitale's original written testimony was used in the Maxi Trial several years later, where Magistrate Giovanni Falcone declared that \\"it is to be hoped that at least after his death Vitale will get the credence he deserved.\\" According to Falcone, the Mafia understood the importance of Vitale's revelations much better than the Italian justice system at the time and killed him when the moment was most opportune.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Novi Beograd and it was the site of the World War II Sajmište concentration camp (1941–1944) under control of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH).  Location  Staro Sajmište is located in the Novi Beograd's Block 17, between the street of Zemunski put (extension of the Old Sava Bridge), the Mihajlo Pupin boulevard (extension of the Branko's bridge) and the Sava river. It extends into the non-residential neighborhood of Ušće on the north and into the newly developed Savograd on the west. Sajmište street curves within the settlement. In the south it extended into the former informal settlement Cardboard city, and further into industrialized neighborhood of Savski Nasip. Although this is what is usually considered as the Staro Sajmište, local community (sub-municipal administrative unit) of the same name also includes the entire Block 18 to the south, which is located between the streets of Vladimira Popovića and Zemunski put, Gazela Bridge and the left bank of the Sava.  History  = Before 1941 = Belgrade Fairground in 1937 In the period between the World Wars, settlements began to form on the left bank of the Sava river, closer to Belgrade, as the only existing settlement on the marshy territory of today's Novi Beograd at that time was the village of Bežanija, quite far away from Belgrade. Construction of the King Alexander Bridge lasted from 1930 to 1934, and the filling and embankment of the Sava bank began in 1936. In the 1930s members of Belgrade's affluent elite began to buy land from the villagers of Bežanija, which at that time, administratively spread all the way to the King Alexander Bridge, which was a dividing point between Bežanija and Zemun. From 1933 a settlement, consisting mostly of individual villas, began to develop. Also, a group of White Russian emigrants built several small buildings, mostly rented by the carters who carried goods across the river. As the settlement, which became known as New Belgrade, was built without building permits, authorities threatened to demolish it, but in 1940 government officially \\"legalized the informal settlement of New Belgrade\\". Prior to that, the city already semi-officially recognized the new settlement, as it helped with building its streets and pathways. By 1939 it already had several thousands inhabitants, a representative in the city hall, and was unofficially called New Belgrade. It was decided to build the fairgrounds complex adjoining to the already existing settlement. The foundation stone was ceremonially placed on 6 June 1937. It was built in three months and the facility was open on 11 September 1937. It was the site of the new Belgrade fair (hence the name) with modern and artistic buildings and constructions, including high metal spike construction, which became known as the Central Tower. Designed by the architects Milivoje Tričković, Rajko Tatić and Đorđe Lukić, it was envisioned as the monumental modern complex, with the Central Tower as the domineering motif. Around it, pavilions for the exhibitions were built: five Yugoslav, one for the “Nikola Spasić Foundation” and national pavilions of Italy, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary and the Dutch company Philips. The complex included: of roofed exhibition space, of open exhibition space, of lawns and flower beds and of roads and paths. It hosted international fairs, with task of promoting the economy of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as well. On the first exhibition from September 1937, there were 883 exhibitors, 493 Yugoslav and 390 foreign (17 countries from Europe, America and Asia). It had 310,000 visitors, while at the 1931 census Belgrade had a population of 266,849. In September 1938 one of the exhibitions on the fair was the first presentation of television in this part of Europe (it will be 18 years before first television station in communist Yugoslavia will appear), by Philips. The first motor show, 1938 Belgrade Car Show, was held in March 1938. Construction of Staro Sajmište was an important, almost pivotal occurrence in urban development of Belgrade at the time, not only due to its economic importance. The complex was the only fully encircled spatial unit, excelling and singling out itself compared to other social centers in the city. It also included the first planned greening of the modern New Belgrade area. The project for the greenery arrangement in the complex was done by engineer Aleksandar Krstić. = War years = Staro Sajmište Central tower, part of the Sajmište concentration camp After the April war of 1941 when Germany and its allies occupied and partitioned the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, entire Syrmia region (including the left bank of the Sava) became part of the Independent State of Croatia. Nazi secret police, Gestapo, took over Sajmište. They encircled it with several rings of barbed wire turning it into what they referred to as \\"collection center\\" – a euphemism for a prison. It eventually became a concentration camp. Until May 1942 Germans used Sajmište concentration camp to mostly kill off Jews from Belgrade and other parts of Serbia. From April 1942 onwards, Serbian prisoners were transported in from Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps run by Croatian Ustaše collaborators. Partisans captured throughout Serbia were also sent to Sajmište. Detainees were also sent in from other parts of Yugoslavia, especially Serbs after major German offensives on briefly liberated territories. Executions of captured prisoners lasted as long as the camp existed. During their heavy “Easter bombing” of Belgrade, Allied aircraft bombed Sajmište on 17 April 1944, killing some 100 inmates and inflicting heavy damage on the camp itself, destroying all the buildings except for the Spasić pavilion and the Central tower.. Among others, prisoners included Serbian women, children and the elderly from Kozara region, entire Jewish families from Belgrade and other cities, Romani families, as well as entire Serbian populations of different Syrmian villages. Initial Yugoslav estimates conducted in 1948 put the death toll at 50,000, with 100,000 total inmates. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the death toll was exaggerated by the Communist Party for political purposes, with the real number of inmates being about 50,000 and 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews perished in the camp. The Staro Sajmište memorial cites 23,000 fatalities, of which 10,000 were Jewish. = After 1945 = After the war the settlement was totally neglected for years and gradually started falling apart. Former fair buildings were awarded to some prominent artists (painters and sculptors) as their ateliers. Finally on 9 July 1987, Belgrade City Assembly decided to make Staro Sajmište a cultural site, thereby protecting it from real-estate expansion development. In 1992 city administration adopted a plan for the area covering 20.5 hectares of land and 1.4 hectares of the Sava river's aquatoria. On 21 April 1995, a monument in remembrance of Sajmište victims was unveiled along Sava, one day ahead of the 50-year anniversary of Hitler admitting defeat on 22 April 1945. However, almost nothing was done to conserve the area and today Staro Sajmište is in a very bad shape. Few remaining old artists have no resources to renovate the complex themselves and the area became the gathering site for vagrants and criminals, so the ateliers are often looted. Population of the local community was 3,147 in 1981, 2,240 in 1991, 2,250 in 2002 and 1,862 in 2011. After the new site of the Belgrade Fair was constructed on the right bank of the Sava, Sajmište became known as Staro Sajmište (old fair ground). Old sandy beach on the Sava bank in Staro Sajmište used to be called \\"Nica\\" (Nice), after kafana where the modern restaurant Ušće is located. At one point, the locality along the quay in Block 18 was chosen as the location of the new Belgrade Opera House. In November 1968, city council adopted a decision for the new opera house to be built along the river bank between the Gazela Bridge and the newly planned New Sava Bridge. The preparatory works were planned to start in 1969 and to finish by 1972 when the proper construction was to begin. The projected deadline was set in 1975. The decision was made as part of the 100th anniversary of the National Theatre in Belgrade, as Belgrade Opera, founded in 1919, is part of the theatre and shares its building. The entire project was later scrapped and neither the opera house nor the new bridge were built. As of June 2019, the opera still has no building of its own. The bank of the Sava in the neighboring Ušće, starting in 1991, became a location of numerous barges (Serbian splav, plural splavovi), which became central venues of the city's modern nightlife. From the summer of 1996, the splavovi spread along the bank of Staro Sajmište, too. Numerous shootouts in the venues, which included the river police and fatalities, ensued. Until that point, only turbo folk music was played in the venues, but the barges in Staro Sajmište were the first where \\"urban\\" splavovi appeared and the entire sub-culture originating in the venues became mainstream. This barges had \\"historical importance\\" for the expansion and acceptance of the venues as an authentic part of the Belgrade's nightlife and tourist offering. However, the constant public conflict between the cheap fun and criminal on the barges, and the solemnity of the neighborhood given its war history, continued for decades. Ultimately, all barges were moved out of Staro Sajmište by the late 2010s.  Characteristics  New Belgrade's local communities As the rest of New Belgrade developed, Staro Sajmište in time became surrounded by various important economic, commercial and landmark features of the new city. They include the Ušće Tower, Ušće Park, with the skatepark, on the north; a complex of business buildings (Naftna Industrija Srbije, Huawei, Delta Holding, Genex Apartments, Savograd), hotels (Crowne Plaza Belgrade, Hyatt Regency Belgrade) and multi-purpose building of Sava Centar, on the west; industrial facilities of Savski Nasip, peninsula of Mala Ciganlija and the Bežanija winter shelter, an arm of the Sava, on the southwest. South of the Zemunski put, a Sajmište parking lot is located where inappropriately parked cars are tolled to. Along the quay on the bank of the Sava in Block 18, there is a Park Republika Srpska, formerly Park of the Non- aligned. = Block 18 = The area of the Block 18, now a completely residential area with individual housing, was added to the project of the controversial Belgrade Waterfront. A plan for the neighborhood was adopted by the city in 2016. It was designed by Vanja Panić, Marko Vesković and Aleksandar Knežević. It includes the complete demolition of the existing urban tissue in the block, which covers an area of . An expanded promenade is planned along the Sava bank. Closer to the Gazela bridge, is the location of the future large square with new opera house, while on the other side, close to Staro Sajmište, there will be a smaller square and the national gallery. A new pedestrian bridge across the river is also planned, which will connect Block 18 directly to the rest of the Belgrade Waterfront. Four skyscrapers, not taller than are projected: one along the Gazela, one next to the Hyatt Regency Belgrade, and two in the center of the block. A local, circular shuttle train line is envisioned, which would also connect the neighborhood with the old section of the city across the river. In January 2019, investment company \\"Marera Properties\\" announced that the new complex would include seats of all secretariats and institutes of the state government and the city of Belgrade. Total floor area built on the owned by the company's should be , and was announced as Belgrade's version of The City. The basis for the project, however, must be the 2016 project and it is not clear how much of the project company plans to participate in as their plans exceed the area they can built on at the moment. Also, it is still not decided whether the lots will be sold to the company or will it lease it from the city. As of this period no works have been done and even in the best case scenario, the construction won't start before 2020. Though it was reported by September 2019 that the plan is a no-go because of the other projects, the investor stated it is not giving up on this location. In the previous decades, all city plans treated this area as part of the Sava Amphitheatre, one urban unit with Savamala across the river in the old section of Belgrade. This was all changed because of the project Belgrade Waterfront which officially kept this part within its scopes, but envisioned completely independent urban development. Despite the fierce opposition of the professional architects and urbanists, city refused to organize the international design competition in 2016. Because of this, and the even stronger opposition to the Belgrade Waterfront in general, it is perceived that the conventional 2016 project was chosen to \\"legalize\\" the entire project and to appease the public.  Future  In February 1992, as provided by the detailed urban plan, the neighborhood was to be fully reconstructed to its pre-war look, an idea opposed by some architects, with added memorial and commemorative objects. The entire complex was to be transformed into one large memorial, but it all remained on paper. The idea was constantly present, gaining media and political momentum in the 2010s, but as of 2018 nothing has been actually done. In November 2018 it was announced that a monument to the humanitarian Diana Budisavljević will be placed along the quay, next to the already existing memorial. Budisavljević saved 15,000 children (12,000 of which survived) from perishing in the Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia, operated by the Ustaše regime during World War II. City decided to erect a monument in her memory already in October 2015, but only now set the location. The monument should be finished and dedicated in the second half of 2019.

Designed by Gunnar Birkerts, the building incorporates a number of innovative and elegant construction and modern architectural design elements in its reinforced concrete construction. Thirteen Hundred was originally designed as the first phase of a two building complex, with the second phase twin apartment building facing Earned Street at the corner of Rivard, immediately south of Lafayette Boulevard. However, market conditions existing at the time of completion resulted in the cancellation of the second project. Eventually this site was developed as the Carlton Apartments. Thirteen Hundred has always had an impeccable reputation which has attracted a number of notable residents, among them the singer Diana Ross. The building's owners fell on hard times in the 1970s due to a declining city population and a mixture of extremely spacious studio to four bedroom apartments, which were not favorable in the rental market at the time. After a mortgage default by the owner, the building briefly became the property of the U.S. in an unusual manner - without the involvement of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, who had insured the mortgage. In 1979 the building was subsequently converted to co-op ownership - on the initiative of the tenants, who organized to avoid a sale to commercial interests or to the City of Detroit.

His political career began in 1974, sparked by his opposition to a dam-building project in Central Indiana. Running for a seat in the Indiana House of Representatives against the dam's sponsor, House Majority Leader John Guy. He was elected at age 22 by a margin of only 2 votes. He was reelected five more times in a heavily Republican district, even after the Republican-controlled legislature made it even more Republican on paper after the 1980 census. He was elected to the Indiana Senate in 1984, where he served for only two years before being elected to the U.S. House. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= Jontz was elected to Congress in 1986 after the retirement of 16-year incumbent Republican Bud Hillis. However, the Republican nominee, State Senator James Butcher, was wounded from a fractious Republican primary, allowing Jontz to win narrowly. He was handily reelected in 1988, but faced much stiffer competition in 1990. Jontz was a progressive Democrat, which seemingly made him an odd fit for his mostly rural north central Indiana district, centering on Kokomo and Logansport. He relied on two key strategies for his congressional elections. First, he embraced a very personal style of populist politics that included frequent appearances in every community in his district. Secondly, Jontz assembled a highly talented and dedicated staff of individuals to work with him, and later many of them-including Tom Sugar, Mike Busch, and Kathy Altman-held prominent government positions. Jontz was narrowly defeated in 1992 by Steve Buyer, an Army officer, Gulf War veteran, and lawyer making his first bid for office. =Committee assignments= During his six-year tenure, he simultaneously held committee memberships on the House Agriculture, Education and Labor, Veterans Affairs, and Select Committee on Aging. He also championed the preservation of the ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest, and worked to foster collaborations between organized labor and environmentalists. He was considered by colleagues to be one of the hardest working members of the U.S. Congress. His campaigns for Congress drew national attention. Celebrity supporters included singers Carole King, Bob Weir, and Don Henley, designer Liz Claiborne, and actors Bonnie Franklin and Woody Harrelson. Most of this support stemmed from Jontz's work on environmental issues. 1994 U.S. Senate election Jontz attempted to return to Washington in 1994 by challenging three-term Senator Dick Lugar He lost to Lugar by more than 600,000 votes, and even lost his old congressional district. Post-congressional career Following his 1994 defeat, Jontz subsequently moved to Portland, Oregon, where he began working as Executive Director for the Western Ancient Forest Campaign. In 1999, Jontz helped organize the Alliance for Sustainable Jobs and the Environment (ASJE). While with WAFC, Jontz built an extremely effective grassroots organizing campaign, which pushed aggressively to protect forests, remove federal subsidies that financed clearcutting, and preserve millions of acres of previously unprotected roadless areas in National Forests. During his tenure with WAFC, he travelled extensively around the country forming relationships with state and local forest protection groups. As a result, Jontz was revered by forest activists throughout North America. In the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr., Jontz participated in acts of civil disobedience — including blocking a logging road in the Siskiyou National Forest in Oregon — to raise awareness about the plight of ancient forests. Those courageous acts were hailed by forest advocates as further proof that Jontz was one of the greatest leaders of the modern environmental movement. In 1998, Jontz was elected president of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA). He was most recently the ADA president emeritus and served as a project coordinator for ADA's Working Families Win project. Jontz died on April 14, 2007 in Portland, following a lengthy battle with colon cancer. References Further reading Boomhower, Ray E.

The organisation stated that it wanted \\"to obtain the Parliamentary Franchise for women on the same terms as it is, or may be, granted to men. Its methods are the methods proper to writers – the use of the pen.\\" The organisation viewed itself as a writers' group rather than a literary society. Membership was not based on literary merit, but instead was granted to anyone who had published and sold a written work. Members also paid an annual subscription fee of 2s. 6d. The league was inclusive and welcomed writers of all genders, classes, genres, and political persuasions provided they were pro-suffrage. By 1911 the league was composed of conservatives, liberals and socialists, women of power and women who worked hard and members of the military. The league disbanded on 24 January 1919 following the passing Representation of the People Bill in February 1918, granting women over the age of 30 the right to vote. The offices of the League were located at 55 Bernes St, Oxford St, W. This group made clear their hatred for androcentrism, reading and revising well known works that marginalised women. They discussed current problems within society and came to a common conclusion; after the meetings they made these problems public so that people would be aware of what was happening. They sought to influence political and social changes through literature.  Activities  The WWSL had members from across the political spectrum, and therefore did not participate in some political demonstrations. Activities of the WWSL included: * Annual General Meetings * At-Homes held in members's homes or in hotels and offices, during which the WWSL goals and activities were discussed * Plays and pageants, together with the Actresses's Franchise League * Fundraisers, including a bookstall at the Women's Social and Political Union exhibition * Literary contests for the best suffrage literature * A library at a military hospital in Endell Street, London, set up by Elizabeth Robins, Bessie Hatton, and Beatrice Harraden. More than 100 members of the WWSL also marched in the \\"Great Demonstration\\" of 21 June 1908, which was organised by the Women's Social and Political Union. Members of the WWSL wore scarlet and white badges with quills. Members also joined marches in July 1910 and June 1911.  Contributions in newspapers  Members of the WWSL contributed to the following newspapers: * Voting * Common Cause * Suffragette * Votes for Women * Women's Suffrage News * Women's Suffrage Journal * Women's Suffrage * Women's Franchise * Women's Dreadnought * The Independent Suffragette They also tried to take part in a public debate with the editorials of a conservative newspaper that went against the suffrage. Elizabeth Robins, the League's first president, became famous for her defense of the cause against the anti suffragist Mrs. Humphry Ward in the Times.  Plays  The WWSL gave the following plays together with the Actresses' Franchise League: * How the Vote was Won * Votes for Women * A Pageant of Great Women * A chat with Mrs Chicky * Press Cutting Along with Actresses' Franchise League they composed works, pageants and shows, some to pay tribute to Shakespeare for integrating in his works the qualities of women. One play written by Beatrice Harraden and Bessie Hatton, Shakespeare's Dreams, featured several of Shakespeare's characters (including Portia, Viola, Perdita, Lady Macbeth, Rosalind, Kate, Beatrice, Puck, Ariel, and Cleopatra) coming to the sleeping poet, giving him flowers, and reciting some of their famous lines.  Ending  The Representation of the People Act passed in 1918, granting women over the age of 30 the right to vote. Although this did not meet the stated goal of the WWSL, which was to earn women the right to vote that was equal to the men's right to vote (men over the age of 21 were enfranchised by the Act), the league nevertheless disbanded on 24 January 1918. Notable members The WWSL had over 100 members, including several notable female suffrage authors: * Elizabeth Robins - First President * Marie Belloc Lowndes - Vice President * Margaret Nevinson - Treasurer * Cicely Hamilton * Bessie Hatton * Beatrice Harraden * May Sinclair * Alice Meynell *Olive Schreiner *Sarah Grand *Violet Hunt *Edith Ayrton *Edith Ellis *Evelyn Sharp *Gertrude Warden *George Paston *Madeline Lucette Ryley The active participation of men, as honorary associates of the league, also differentiated the WWSL from late-twentieth- century feminist literary groups.

During the first half of the 20th century, the residential district surrounding Wick Park included some of the city's most affluent neighborhoods. The district is \\"roughly bounded by 5th Ave, Park Ave, Elm St. and Broadway\\".  History  In the era of industrialization, Youngstown's wealthiest business leaders and professionals migrated away from the downtown to the wooded areas near the city's northern border. These semi-suburban neighborhoods were secluded from the noisy activity of the city's steel mills and retail businesses. Wick Avenue is sometimes described as Youngstown's version of Euclid Avenue (Cleveland's Millionaire's Row), or Fifth Avenue in New York City: it was home to the community's most established families. Although some of these mansions have survived, few are currently used for residential purposes. Youngstown State University, whose campus is located south of Wick Park, purchased several of these homes and renovated them for administrative use. One campus-area mansion now holds the Arms Family Museum of Local History.Arms Family Museum of Local History Accessed 2007-03-07  Surrounding features  Running through the western portion of the district is Fifth Avenue, which is lined with stately homes that were built by members of the area's elite. The most well-preserved of these homes are located along the upper reaches of the street, near Gypsy Lane, in the North Heights neighborhood. On the western edge of Wick Park, on Fifth Avenue, stands the Neoclassical landmark Stambaugh Auditorium, which is also listed on the National Register. The most prominent landmark located south of the Wick Park Historic District is the former Pollock estate, which sits along the main artery of Wick Avenue. Restored and expanded in the 1980s, the mansion was turned into an upscale hotel known as the Wick-Pollock Inn. Since the hotel's closure in the late 1990s, the university allowed the renovated structure to sit vacant. However, in February 2010, the YSU Board of Trustees voted to restore the home and designate it as the official residence of the university president. YSU students have led recent efforts to restore the historic sunken garden located behind the structure. The George J. Renner, Jr. House, a house listed individually on the National Register, is also included in the district.  Revitalization  Wick Park occupies a central portion of the district and is maintained by the Youngstown Department of Parks and Recreation. A recent effort to revitalize the park is being led by a coalition of local organizations including the City of Youngstown, Youngstown CityScape, Youngstown State University, the Wick Park Neighborhood Association and Treez Please ()..

Young Municipal Center is a government office building and courthouse located at 2 Woodward Avenue in Downtown Detroit, Michigan. Originally called the City-County Building, it was renamed for the former Detroit Mayor Coleman A. Young, shortly after his death in 1997. It serves as the City of Detroit government headquarters. The Coleman A. Young Municipal Center houses offices, courtrooms, and meeting rooms. The class-A office building stands near the Renaissance Center, Hart Plaza, Ally Detroit Center, Courtyard by Marriott-Downtown Detroit, and the Millender Center. Architecture The Coleman A. Young Municipal Center in December 2015 The modernist International-style building was designed by the architectural firm of Harley, Ellington and Day. Construction began on the skyscraper in 1951 and was completed in 1954. It is 20 floors tall, and including the basement has 21 total floors. Three sides of the building's exterior are faced with white Vermont marble with black marble spandrel panels beneath the windows of the Courts Tower to emphasize the building's vertical lines. The verticality of the tower section, with its white marble-clad piers and dark spandrels, offers a distinct contrast with the 14-story Administration Tower office section, in which horizontal lines are emphasized. The brick of the Randolph Street facade was not covered with marble to allow for a more economical future expansion. =Towers= ;Administration Tower The 14-story portion of this complex is called the Administration Tower and is tall, from the ground to the mechanical penthouse roof parapet. The Administration Tower holds offices for the City of Detroit and Wayne County, as well as doctor clinics, laboratories, a municipal library, and the City Council auditorium chambers on the 13th floor. ;Courts Tower The 20-story portion of this complex is called the Courts Tower and is tall. It contains office space on floors 1 through 8, and courtrooms, judges chambers, and jury rooms on floors 9 through 19, with the 20th floor housing the building's mechanical equipment. A marble wall element rises high stands west of the Courts Tower, and is connected to the tower by a canopy that forms the Woodward Avenue entrance. Bas reliefs of the Detroit and Wayne County seals are carved in the wall, along with a quote from the Bible (2 Corinthians 3:17) Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. The Spirit of Detroit by sculptor Marshall Fredericks, at the municipal center. =Statue= The Spirit of Detroit, a tall bronze statue by sculptor Marshall Fredericks, is located at the Courts Tower's marble wall element. As one of Detroit's most easily identifiable landmarks, a sketch of the statue appears as the central element of most of the logos of Detroit's city departments and services. When Detroit sports teams (the Red Wings, Pistons and Tigers) have been in contention for their league's championship, the statue has traditionally been outfitted with a huge version of the appropriate team's jersey. =Skyway= An enclosed skyway over Randolph Street connects to the Millender Center, Courtyard by Marriott - Downtown Detroit, and the Renaissance Center as a sort of \\"enclosed city within a city\\". Entrance from the walkway to the third-floor level requires a security pass, and persons without a pass must return to the main floor entrance. Operations The Coleman A. Young Municipal Center is operated by the Detroit-Wayne Joint Building Authority, which was created in 1948 by the Michigan Legislature. The building contains a library, a courthouse, and the city hall. When it opened, the City-County Building replaced both the historic Detroit City Hall and Wayne County Building. Many Wayne County offices have since moved to the nearby Guardian Building which now serves as the county's headquarters. The offices of the Wayne County Clerk remain in the building as does one division of the Wayne County (Third Judicial) Circuit Court, Circuit Court Administrative Offices and the Wayne County Probate Court. On June 28, 2008, the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center was struck by lightning during a series of intense thunderstorms, and caused a transformer fire within the building. It re-opened for service on July 9, 2008. The smoke and fire damage is easily visible across the river, in Windsor, Ontario, where many windows have been removed, or have shattered.

From the 1970s until the mid-1990s, it was popular among yakuza, chinpira (low-level criminals), bōsōzoku (motorcycle gang members), truck drivers, construction workers, and enka singers. The punch perm began to fall out of usage as a result of its general association with the yakuza, as well as normal fashion trends. The style is similar to the Jheri curl, which was popular in the United States during roughly the same time frame, but the curls in a punch perm are much tighter. History The hair style was invented by Shigemi Naganuma, a Japanese barber at the hair salon Naganuma in Kokurakita-ku, Kitakyūshū in the 1960s. He based the style on black hair. At that time, hair irons were round and could not hold the hair tightly. Naganuma modified the iron by filing it into a hexagonal shape, like a pencil, which created a tighter hold. He originally named the style \\"champion press\\", however, it came to be called \\"punch perm\\". According to one theory, the name is because of its punchy and powerful appearance. In popular culture The character Bunta Takakura from the popular anime and manga series Crayon Shin- chan has a punch perm. * Piko Taro, singer of PPAP (Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen), is known for his punch perm and loud clothes. * Kazuma Kuwabara from Yu-Yu Hakusho, wears a sort of them.

It was published in by Enterbrain in the seinen magazine Monthly Comic Beam between October 2002 and October 2005 and collected in six bound volumes. It is licensed in North America by Tokyopop, with the final volume published in November 2008. The series is about a group of people who are put in suspended animation to escape a mysterious plague that turns people to stone, and upon waking there appears to be only seven survivors in a world run wild—including a Japanese teenage girl named Kasumi Ishiki and a British man named Marco Owen. The survivors soon discover that the entire ruin is filled with strange, dinosaur-like creatures and other monstrous aberrations of nature. Thinking that a great amount of time passed since their arrival on the island, soon the survivors discover not only that their sleep was indeed too short to label such dramatic changes as natural occurrence, but also that the situation in and of itself is far greater than they could imagine. A feature anime film adaptation produced by Sunrise and directed by Kazuyoshi Katayama was released on May 1, 2010.  Plot  King of Thorn is a science fiction survivor drama. After a viral infection known as the Medusa virus lands in Siberia and spreads contagiously throughout Earth, 160 humans are chosen as candidates to experiment a cure against the virus by an organization called Venus Gate. As the story begins, Kasumi is selected as one of the 160 people for the experiment. She is forced to enter treatment and cold sleep without her twin sister Shizuku, whom she cares much about. However, 48 hours later, some of those put in hibernation abruptly woke up, only to find the facility where they were supposed to be treated in a total state of decay, invaded by a lush jungles of trees and especially strange vines covered in thorns, which appear to have something of a mind on their own. Not only that, but the survivors soon discover that the entire ruin is filled with strange, dinosaur- like creatures and other monstrous aberrations of nature. Thinking that a great amount of time passed since their arrival on the island, soon the survivors discover not only that their sleep was indeed too short to label such dramatic changes as natural occurrence, but also that the situation in and of itself is far greater than they could imagine. = The Medusa Virus = One pivotal role in the series is that covered by the Medusa virus, a mortal disease so named after the Medusa from Greek Mythology, the Gorgon whose eyesight could turn anyone and anything into stone at a mere glance. The virus itself is extremely virulent, infecting its victims' cells and causing seizures while drying up the body, turning the infected into a solid, stone- like corpse. While perceived as a terrible malady by the world, in reality the Medusa virus is not a virus at all, being a shapeless presence brought to Earth from outer space. It landed in Siberia during a meteor shower, by chance near a young boy and his pet deer, enough to instantly infect both him and his animal. Unknowingly bringing the concentrated thing to his home, he infected his whole family and his sister Alice. She unknowingly uncovered the true nature of Medusa when her imaginary friend, a cat-boy hybrid, came to life by erupting from her back. Terrified by the death of her family and the fact that the newborn creature devoured her brother's deer, she trapped it in her house and set it on fire, thus spreading Medusa all over the world through the fire's smoke. It was then that the people affiliated with Venus Gate, a religious sect, showed themselves and approached Alice, believing her ability to turn imagination into reality to be a gift from the heavens. Experimenting on her and Medusa, during that time they employed a hacker named Zeus as their security specialist, though in doing so they doomed themselves when he, pursuing his crazy dreams, developed an artificial way to force dreams into suitable hosts and, thus, fabricate mind-created realities at will to accomplish his plan to force the world into a primal survival game to amuse himself.  Characters  ; : : Kasumi is the main protagonist of the story, which for the most part is told by her point of view. One of the 160 people around the world lucky (or rich) enough to be chosen as potential cure testbeds for the Medusa virus, she left the world leaving behind herself her twin sister Shizuku, who was also victim of the virus, though until the end encouraged Kasumi to accept such an opportunity and be cured. She was the first of these people to be awakened and the first to find the ruin that struck the medical facility they were treated in. A shy and gentle girl, she was notable in that she was the only one who actually supported the thuggish- looking Marco when the survivors started their escape, something that eventually turned into a crush, though ill-advised by more than one of the other characters, who saw Marco as dangerous and untrustworthy. : Occasional glimpses are offered on Kasumi's life prior to her being chosen: she was quiet and reserved, the foil of her twin sister in mind, though identical in body, save for the fact that she wore glasses. These flashbacks show that Kasumi was strongly attached to Shizuku, to the point of borderline obsession, which in turn not only fueled unstable thoughts, such as wishing to die in the same way at the same time, but also gave birth to suicidal tendencies that manifested themselves when Kasumi, while bathing, tried to take her life by slitting her wrist with a razor, unable to accept the idea of living in a world without her beloved sister. Shizuku was nearby and saved her sister, though their bond was greatly shaken. : Only at the end of the series it was revealed that Kasumi was dead all along: before parting, she and Shizuku shared a brief moment together on the cliffs near the castle that housed the medical treatment facility, and during this instance Kasumi, still unwilling to be the only one to survive, wished for the two of them to die together by jumping down the cliff. Rejected by Shizuku, Kasumi was accidentally thrown over the edge during the ensuing struggle and killed, an event that unleashed her sister's Medusa powers and, with them, the chaos that would envelop the island and the world itself. The Kasumi the viewer sees during the entire story is, in fact, a Medusa-produced entity created by Shizuku, who wished for her sister to be alive no matter what, even at the expense of the world. : In the film version, she and Tim are left as the only survivors at the facility, with Kasumi vowing to help him reunite with his parents. ; : : Marco is the main male character of the series. He is a fearsome-looking man with a muscular frame and many intimidating tattoos all over his body who is also an expert hacker, so much so that he was able to crack through the CIA's computers – and those of Venus Gate, something that had him arrested and incarcerated for more than half a century (during the events of the manga, he still had 60 years to serve in prison). While a prisoner he was approached by the NSA, which offered him complete parole for his crimes in exchange of his help in dealing with the Medusa affair. Becoming a de facto spy for the United States, he was sent as a patient to the gathering at Venus Gate labs, the same where all the other main characters were sent, in order to assess the objectives of the gathering, gather evidence on the mysterious Level 4 labs of the island, and also to pursue a personal vendetta against his old friend Zeus, who framed him for crimes he did not commit before vanishing. He was trying to accomplish what he was sent to do when the Medusa outbreak and Shizuku's awakening occurred, and in the ensuing chaos he was left unconscious. Thus, he was able to present himself to the other survivors as one of them. : During most of the series Marco acts tough, and his overall appearance and mannerism leave the other survivor highly suspicious of him, especially when they discover that he never had the Medusa virus in the first place. Nevertheless, given the fact that he is the most skilled of them all, Marco is silently accepted as the leader of the group, at least until he goes on his own to try to find Zeus. He was also the first of them to encounter the ghostly apparition of Alice, and on more than one instance was seen arguing with her. Also, he himself was suspicious of Kasumi after seeing video footage of her twin sister Shizuku trailing after the wave of monstrous beings that erupted from Level 4. : During the climax of the story he died once, killed by Zeus's artificially created beast soldiers, though his corpse was later found and resurrected by Alice, a deed for which she sacrificed her life. He was thus able to face Zeus head-on by literally hacking into him and, finally, completely erasing him for good. What happened to him and Kasumi after they saved themselves is left to the reader to speculate, though apparently their feelings for each other were mutual. :In the film version, he succumbs to his injuries after making Kasumi promise him to live life to the fullest and to not take it for granted: \\"Please, grant a soldier his dying wish.\\" She then kisses him goodbye and thanks him for all he did for her, intending to follow her promise. ; : : Katherine is a pretty young woman in her late twenties and the worst Medusa case among the survivors, being the most infected one of them all. Since their encounter she acts in a motherly way towards Tim, the youngest of them being only a little boy. Before becoming infected, Katherine was an alcoholic and was prone to abuse her son Michael, until he was taken away from her and placed in foster care. This events shook her greatly and left her with bitter disgust for herself, prompting her to try to be a true mother for Tim as she wasn't for her son. : Later in the story, the Medusa infection in her completely consumes her body, which starts to crumble apart during an assault of monstrous creatures. On the verge of death she deliberately stabs herself, triggering the Medusa inside her and becoming what she believed was the figure of an ideal mother, a harpy-like creature. While still capable of recognizing Tim and the other survivors, she herself was nothing more than what Katherine's heart and memories were at the moment of her death. Nevertheless, she still showed the same attachment to Tim and fought against the monsters threatening him, though she was seriously wounded and was left with the boy to recover. Later captured by Zeus' soldiers, she was set free during the end. : In the film version, she succumbs to the Medusa virus after the helicopter she pilots crashes. ; : : Peter was an engineer and doctor, the creator of the cold sleep capsules used by Kasumi and the other people gathered by Venus Gate. Despite his success in creating stable prototypes of the capsules, a sudden crisis of the electronics market left him without financial support, until Venus Gate expressed interest in his project and hired him and his colleagues. He succeeded in perfecting the cold sleep capsules and gained access to most of Venus Gate's labs, though he never clearly understood what the mysterious Level 4 was for. However, after developing the capsule he was suddenly withdrawn from the project, which was in turn passed to Level 4 and left him bitter with resentment, so much so that his only obsession became to retrieve his cold sleep capsule from Venus Gate. He apparently succeeded in discovering the Level 4 data, though in doing so he was discovered and taken prisoner, after which he was infected with Medusa. : While awoken with the other survivors, Peter turned traitor on them when he took Kasumi with himself (this being a mind-planted instinct forced by Zeus) and searched for the laptop containing the downloaded files. He paid for this search with his life when the room where he was suddenly crumbled on him, killing him. Nevertheless, as he was infected with Medusa, he managed to come back to life as a twisted being filled with insects and cockroaches. Taken prisoner while trying to get back his original, first cold sleep capsule, he was killed by Zeus when he tried to attack him. : In the film version, he's beheaded by one of the creatures unintentionally imagined by Tim after giving Kasumi vital information on the CSCC. ; (The Senator) : : Alexandro is an elderly white man and a politician who bought his place among those chosen to be cured, he was gruff and cowardly, always putting his well-being before that of others. He was the first one to notice that Marco Owen was a dangerous criminal by seeing his tattoos, sparking a brief but intense confrontation which fortunately ended thanks to Peter's reasoning and Kasumi's pleas. He was devoured alive by ferocious, over-sized eels while the group was traveling through an underground flooded tunnel in the manga version and beheaded by one of Tim's imagined dinosaur-like creatures in the film version. ; (Tim) : : Tomothy is a very young boy (possibly no more than six years old) hailing from Germany, who is infected with the virus. Quite resilient and mature despite his age, he formed a tight bond with Katherine, seeing her as if she was his mother, though calling her auntie in the process. Due to him being so young, his role is relatively minor, though sometimes he proved himself to be a precious asset to the team. It was reviewed that Tim was controlled by Alice as a guide from time to time. He would space out and lead the way. Then when the group was where Alice wanted them to be he snapped back to his real self. He was also one of the survivors at the end of the story and began looking for his parents with Kasumi. : In the film version, we learn that Tim's parents are divorced and in the midst of a less-than-amicable custody battle over him, something that upsets him greatly. ; : : Ron is a black police officer from the US. The most physically strong of the survivors, he was something of a fatalist, frequently lamenting on how hopeless the situation was and how useless struggling to survive would be. Despite his lack of optimism, he nevertheless tried to escape with his life, though he refused to enter Level 4 and was left behind, his leg injured. He was the first to witness Peter's revived, insect- filled Medusa form, at whose sight he became frightened and ran away, struggling by himself against the perils of the ruined facility. He almost drowned when Marco, oblivious of Ron's presence, drained the facility's main shaft from a massive flood, and later reunited himself with Kasumi, Tim and Katherine. His fatalistic approaches gone, this time he stood firm with the conviction of protecting not only himself, but also those with him, which prompted him to rescue Katherine despite her being on the verge of death. : Captured by Zeus with Tim, he too was to be transformed into a beast soldier, though when saved by Marco he remained mostly human, save for his hair, which turned pink. : In the film version, he succumbs to the Medusa virus while trying to hold off one of the creatures, allowing the others to keep moving. ; : : Alice is a Russian little girl and the younger sister of the boy who firstly came into contact with the Medusa virus during the meteor shower in Siberia. It is hinted, and later confirmed by herself, that she was abused by her family, and thus suffered from dissociative identity disorder, using an imaginary friend, a cat-boy named Laloo as a means to endure her harsh life. She was the sole survivor of her whole family when they all died due to the Medusa infection, and in such a moment she unconsciously gave birth — literally — to her imaginary friend, which emerged from her own body and started devouring her brother's deer. Frightened, Alice locked him up and set her house on fire, destroying her family's corpses and killing Laloo, but also spreading Medusa around the world thanks to the fire's smokes. : It was after the fire that she was approached by Karol Vega, who took her in and used her as a guinea pig for his experiments with the cold capsules created by Peter Stevens. What happened to her was initially left unknown, and Alice was firstly introduced to the reader as something of a malevolent apparition, often smirking cruelly at the survivors' struggles or talking to the massive monstrosity that was Shizuku. Only later, when Kasumi encountered her, she revealed herself to be a mere ghost, a projection of the mind of the real Alice, still locked into a sealed lab deep inside Level 4. Apparently she never aged, and after all the experiments she endured, what was left of her was only her head, her left arm, and a portion of her chest large enough to contain her heart and one lung, kept alive by medical equipment and the sheer power of Medusa. As a tribute to her namesake, she was guarded by a massive white rabbit automaton born from her imagination. : When Zeus' army stormed the lab she was sealed in, she escaped, though doing so put her life at great risk. After discovering Marco's corpse, she burned what was left of her life to resurrect him, vanishing after performing such an act. ; : : Shizuku is Kasumi's twin sister who is identical to her if not only for their hairstyle, the fact that Shizuku doesn't wear glasses and she has a upbeat and cheerful personality. Infected with Medusa, despite being left out of those chosen to be cured, among who there was her own sister, she still greatly supported her and insisted for her to take the chance to be saved from Medusa. However, their bond grew increasingly strained after Shizuku witnessed Kasumi trying to kill herself, and again when, before parting with each other, Kasumi wished for them to commit suicide together, being incapable to accept a world without her twin. During the ensuing struggle Shizuku accidentally pushed Kasumi over the edge of the cliff they were standing on, and shocked at the death of her sister, awakened her Medusa power. : Transported into Level 4, still overwhelmed by the memory of her sister's death, Shizuku created a countless amount of abominations, initially blobs of quivering flesh, maws and claws which laid waste to the labs while massacring the staff, and only through Zeus' mind-controlling program conceiving the creatures that would populate the ruined island, such as the dinosaurs encountered by the protagonists at the beginning. Also, it is revealed that the monstrous behemoth encountered at the beginning of the manga, and later shown occasionally as the \\"mother\\" of the creatures, was Shizuku herself, the beast being an unconscious armor to seal herself from the world. : While often mentioned by Kasumi during the course of the story, Shizuku appeared often, other than in her monstrous form, through ominous apparitions, often Kasumi's delusions or unconscious mental links between the sisters, and only in the end she appeared at the core of her mutated form, begging Kasumi not to uncover the fact that she was only a Medusa-made creation, and that her true self had died. With the death of Zeus, she too ceased to exist, her monstrous body crumbling to pieces and her essence fading away peacefully. ; : Zeus is considered to be the best hacker in the world and a closely observed subject by both NSA and CIA, Zeus is the main antagonist of the series and the archenemy of Marco. The two were apparently rivals in their past, until Zeus broke into the CIA mainframe and then framed Marco for the crime, escaping soon after. At some point he was approached by Karol Vega and made security chief for Venus Gate's labs, especially Level 4, for which he created the tight security systems. A deeply disturbed person, he saw war, strife and conflict as a boring, unrealistic form of entertainment, and claimed that humanity as a species had lost its will to survive. Keeping such ideas a secret from his employers, he devised a way to control Medusa carriers at will, applying it to Shizuku when he found she was much more powerful a carrier than Alice herself. His last act as a human being was amusing himself while looking at Shizuku creating deformed aberrations, before turning his own self into data and entwining it with the monster Shizuku would later become. : Zeus was only seen or mentioned in flashbacks during the course of the story until the end, where he presented himself and declared his will to use Shizuku, a never-ending supply of creatures defying the laws of nature, to build up his own army of beastmen warriors and other fantasy-like beings and with them plunder the world into chaos, an endless game of survival for his own amusement. To do so, and knowing that Shizuku would wake up her sister from her induced slumber, he tampered with the other survivors' minds, forcing them to unconsciously not run away after waking up, and especially protect Kasumi's life, which was necessary to coerce Shizuku in doing his biddings. : His material body reduced to a rotting corpse, Zeus manifested himself through membranes expelled by Shizuku's tail, and later took direct control of her, declaring the act to be \\"the birth of a god\\". This final act proved to be fatal, as he was first weakened when Kasumi and Shizuku encountered each other, and then completely erased when Marco hacked into his data, deleting him. : Zeus does not appear in the film version. ; : : Ivan was the Russian founder of Venus Gate, a religious cult which came to see the power of Medusa as a gift from God himself, and which took Alice in after discovering her in Siberia. Though her suffering could be attributed to him and his religious views could have been easily labeled as senseless fanaticism, Vega was indeed left speechless and horrified by the sheer cruelty of Zeus, whose true identity and goals he was oblivious of, and during the chaotic outbreak at Level 4 he sealed himself inside his study, deep in the facility. He recorded the entire story of how Medusa came into being, how it could turn imagination into reality and what really happened in the lab, ending his last speech asking Alice for forgiveness, before killing himself with a shotgun blast in his mouth. : Much later in the story, Vega's dead body would be discovered by Kasumi, Marco, Kathrine and Tim. : In the film version, he attempts suicide with a pistol before Kasumi intervened with a shotgun, then appears to die when the floor beneath him collapses.

All of the main characters' backstories are drained down and their different storylines are changed from their counterparts in the manga. Zeus, who is a major antagonist in the manga, does not appear in the film. Alice, the young Russian girl, does make an appearance, but is deceased in present time. and then, Terry Notary (In the English Dub) portrays the monsters in his CGI suit while Toru Nara (In the Japanese Dub) voices them.

Reception  The English edition of King of Thorn was named by the Young Adult Library Services Association as among the 10 best graphic novels for teens for 2008. Volume one was praised by Publishers Weekly as \\"a gripping entry in the genre of violent survivor manga,\\" and praised Iwahara's art for conveying the character's claustrophobia without confusing the reader. Theron Martin of Anime News Network found both the writing and artwork effectively convey the characters' tension and danger, but claimed that Iwahara's borrowing elements from many sources did not initially create an original work, but that as the series progresses it \\"offer[s] some intriguing twists on sci fi and horror gimmicks.\\" Iwahara's art was singled out for praise, especially for conveying action scenes. The film was nominated for the 4th Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film.

There is a statutory right of appeal to the High Court of England and Wales and thence to the Court of Appeal.Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992 On the formation of the Residential Property Tribunal Service as a result of the Housing Act 2004 the rent assessment committees became part of that body for administrative purposes, and is therefore now called the First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber - Residential Property).  Jurisdiction  The First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber - Residential Property) has the following jurisdictions: * cancellation of a registered rent (s. 81A Rent Act 1977) * determination of the terms of a statutory periodic assured tenancy (s. 6 Housing Act 1988) * determination of a market rent for an assured tenancy (s. 22 Housing Act 1988) * questions concerning purchase notices * questions concerning acquisition orders  Membership  The First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber - Residential Property) normally consists of two or three persons from the local Rent Assessment Panel selected by the president (or in their absence a vice- president) of the Panel.para. 4 Sch. 10 Rent Act 1977 At least one member, who will chair the First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber - Residential Property), must be a president or vice-president of the panel or a lawyer appointed by the Lord Chancellor.para. 5 Sch. 10 Rent Act 1977 The president or vice- president of a panel may direct that certain cases, or classes of cases, may be heard by a single chairman sitting alonepara. 6 Sch. 10 Rent Act 1977 and any application to cancel a registered rent because the property is no longer subject to a restricted contract will be heard by a single chairman.para 6A. Sch. 10 Rent Act 1977, inserted by s. 71(2) Housing Act 1980  Appeals  An appeal may be made, usually on a point of law only, to the High Court of England and Wales. The First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber - Residential Property) may also be required to sign and state a case for the opinion of the High Court.s. 11 Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992 There is an approved procedure for such an appeal.Rules of the Supreme Court order 94.8 Appeals on points of law are made to the Administrative Court of the High Court using a Part 8 Claim Form with the appropriate fee. Appeals may also be made on procedural irregularities by way of judicial review. A further appeal may then be made to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales.s. 11(3) Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992  Procedure  Procedure is informal and there are few procedural rules. The procedure is governed by the Rent Assessment Committees (England and Wales) Regulations 1971 (SI 1065/1971), which has been amended a number of times since. The first stage will be for the First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber - Residential Property), to establish whether it has jurisdiction in the matter. This will often be done by administrative staff. In cases where the administrative staff do not believe that they have jurisdiction they will refer the matter to the RAC to determine this point. The First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber - Residential Property) will accept representations either on paper or in person. Assuming that the committee accepts that it has the necessary jurisdiction to make a decision it will set down the matter for a hearing. Any of the involved parties can ask that the RAC hears evidence at the hearing to support their case although they are required to do so at least 28 days before the hearing date itself. In cases where the First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber - Residential Property) is being asked to decide on a market rent, and in other cases where it seems appropriate, the committee members will seek to visit the property in question. They will usually do this on the morning of the day scheduled for the hearing.

This episode guest stars actor Robert Picardo, who played the role of the Emergency Medical Hologram on Star Trek: Voyager; in this episode, Picardo portrays the EMH's creator, Dr. Lewis Zimmerman. The episode also features guest performances by Brian George and anthropologist Fadwa El Guindi as the parents of Dr. Julian Bashir. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet-managed Bajoran space station Deep Space Nine. In this episode, Dr. Lewis Zimmerman comes to DS9 to create a medical hologram based on Dr. Bashir, leading to the revelation that Bashir was genetically modified as a child. The episode's title refers to the famous quotation attributed to Henry Morton Stanley on encountering the medical missionary and explorer, Doctor Livingstone. Plot Hologram engineer Lewis Zimmerman comes to Deep Space Nine with the intent of using Dr. Bashir's likeness as a template for a holographic program designed to provide medical treatment. In order to make the program as robust as possible, Zimmerman needs a complete personality profile on Bashir. Against Bashir's wishes, Zimmerman invites Julian's estranged parents, Amsha and Richard Bashir, to the station to be interviewed. Julian is embarrassed by his father's tendency toward self-aggrandizement. For example, Richard references a time he \\"ran shuttles\\" when, in fact, he was merely a steward and was fired shortly into his career. Julian implores his parents not to reveal to Zimmerman anything about a secret from his childhood, and they are angered that he thinks they would be so sloppy. Later, his parents go to the infirmary to try to assuage their son's fears, stating emphatically that they will not tell Zimmerman that they had Julian illegally genetically modified when he was a child. However, they are unaware that they are speaking to Zimmerman's new hologram, rather than to their son. Zimmerman and Chief O'Brien are in the next room and hear everything they say. O'Brien informs Julian about what he heard. Julian is furious, but confirms that he was genetically modified as a child. He was a poor student, apparently had a learning disability, and seemed destined for failure; his parents took him for DNA resequencing, greatly improving his intelligence and his physicality. With the secret out, Bashir sees no alternative but to resign from Starfleet; genetically modified individuals are banned from Starfleet and from practicing medicine. Before Bashir can tender his resignation, his parents take matters into their own hands. Richard strikes a deal with the Judge Advocate General: Richard will spend two years in a minimum security prison for illegal genetic engineering, and Julian is allowed to retain his commission and his medical license. Julian makes some peace with his parents as they depart for Earth, grateful for his father's sacrifice. Meanwhile, Zimmerman pursues Dabo girl Leeta's affections, asking her to accompany him back to Jupiter Station. Shy Rom is too scared to say anything to convince her to stay, although Leeta would welcome any reason to stay with him. She is on the verge of leaving with Zimmerman when Rom careens around the corner and gives her the long-awaited reason to stay: \\"I love you.\\" Leeta reciprocates, and agrees to stay. Casting Amsha Bashir is portrayed by Fadwa El Guindi, an anthropologist with no previous screen acting experience, at the time a professor at UCLA. She was invited to audition for the role by Ron Surma, who saw her community theatre performance in Mahjar, a play she co-wrote and co-directed. Related episodes The villainous character of Khan Noonien Singh, introduced in the episode \\"Space Seed\\" of Star Trek: The Original Series, is mentioned in this episode as an example of the possible dangerous consequences of genetic manipulation. \\"Statistical Probabilities\\" and \\"Chrysalis\\", later episodes of Deep Space Nine, feature Bashir working with other genetically-modified characters whose modifications were not as successful as his.

He became Chief of Joint Rapid Deployment Force Operations (soon shortened to Chief of Joint Force OperationsRichards 2014, 96.) at the Permanent Joint Headquarters in March–April 1998. In this role, as the default commander for short notice expeditionary operations, he commanded the UK Contingent in East Timor as part of INTERFET in 1999 and twice commanded a UK Joint Task Force in Sierra Leone in 2000. In 2000, during the Sierra Leone Civil War, Richards was in command of Operation Palliser, ostensibly to rescue British and other foreign nationals but which he then independently transformed into a commitment to support the embattled national president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and lead the defence of his capital Freetown against the Revolutionary United Front. Although not initially sanctioned by London, the action was cited as a second example of the kind of liberal military intervention previously seen in Kosovo, and as such attributed to British Prime Minister Tony Blair. In April 2001 Richards became Chief of Staff of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, with the rank of major general. He became the British Assistant Chief of the General Staff in 2002, and on 19 January 2005 became the Commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, which carried promotion to lieutenant general. General Sir David Richards (right) during his tenure as ISAF commander, with US Defense Secretary Robert Gates In July 2006, command of the international forces (the International Security Assistance Force) in southern Afghanistan was passed to NATO forces under Richards's command and he was promoted to the acting rank of full general (4-star).Kim Sengupta, 'We need 30,000 more soldiers to beat Taliban,' says general, The Independent, 17 October 2008.

On 1 February 2008 he was promoted to substantive General and appointed Commander-in-Chief, Land Forces in succession to General Sir Redmond Watt, and on 12 June 2008 he was appointed Aide-de-Camp General (ADC Gen) to The Queen.

In early August 2009, just before taking up his post, Richards was widely criticised when he claimed that British troops may have a role in Afghanistan for up to 40 years.New army chief under fire over ‘40 years’ claim The Times, 9 August 2009. Retrieved 10 August 2009. General Sir Richard Dannatt handed over his appointment as Chief of the General Staff at midday on 28 August 2009 to Richards. In February 2010, Richards said that a \\"turning point\\" had been reached in the battle against the Taliban. He suggested troop numbers could begin to decline as early as 2011 while the majority would be withdrawn by 2015. Richards said \\"we are now seeing some very optimistic signs\\" in the latest military offensive, Operation Moshtarak (togetherness), in Helmand. The Taliban had been forced to give \\"serious consideration\\" about continuing the fight. Richards said that: \\"We expect the military conflict to trail off in 2011,\\" who was visiting British front-line forces for the first time since taking command of the Army last year. \\"The combat role will start to decline in 2011, but we will remain militarily engaged in training and support roles for another five years, and we will remain in a support role for many years to come.\\" General Sir David Richards with Chuck Hagel in 2013 Richards said that \\"The Taliban is now beginning to realise that they can lose this war, which was not the view they had a year ago. We have to reinforce the view that they can, and will, be beaten.\\" In 2010, however, he also stated in a radio interview that \\"I think there's no reason why we shouldn't be looking at [talking to the Taliban] pretty soon\\". On 14 July 2010, the Ministry of Defence announced that in October 2010 Richards would become the next Chief of the Defence Staff in succession to Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup. Downing Street, in a press statement to announce the intended ennoblement of Sir Jock, also announced in the same release that Sir David would take up his new post as Chief of the Defence Staff on Friday 29 October 2010, immediately after the retirement of Sir Jock. In November 2010, Richards said there was no desire to \\"open up another front\\" in the Middle East but suggested that in future it \\"might be\\" necessary. David Cameron told Parliament that Britain would \\"take every step to cut out the terrorist cancer that lurks in the Arabian Peninsula\\", but Gen Richards said an intelligence-led approach was the current strategy. Richards added: \\"Clearly, the primary agencies dealing with this are our intelligence and security agencies. But the military are already helping with their [the Yemenis'] training. I don't think we want to open up another front there and nor do the Yemenis want us to do that. So we have to find other ways of doing these things and in the meantime making sure Afghanistan doesn't revert to becoming, if you like, a 'second Yemen' – that is the Army's primary duty at the moment. Our role is to remain very close to them, to help them where they most need it and in the meanwhile focus our efforts on Afghanistan and assisting Pakistan to ensure they don't become the threat Yemen is beginning to be. In May 2011, Richards and other senior NATO officers expressed a wish for backing from member states to intensify the war effort in Libya by directly targeting Col Gaddafi's regime, rather than simply protecting Libyan civilians. \\"The military campaign to date has been a significant success for NATO and our Arab allies, but we need to do more. If we do not up the ante now there is a risk that the conflict could result in Gaddafi clinging to power,\\" said Gen Richards. He added that, while NATO forces were not targeting Col Gaddafi directly, he could nevertheless become a legitimate target if he was caught directly attacks against Libyan civilians. \\"The United Nations resolution allows Nato to use 'all necessary means' in Libya,\\" he said. \\"We are not targeting Gaddafi directly, but if it happened that he was in a command and control centre that was hit by Nato and he was killed, then that is within the rules.\\" During the Syrian Civil War, Richards drew up plans to train and equip a Syrian rebel army of 100,000 to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad, as an alternative option to the government's plan for limited direct military involvement. The plans were rejected by the National Security Council as too ambitious. Ultimately on 29 August 2013, parliament refused to support the government's plan to participate in military strikes against the Syrian government. Richards was succeeded as Chief of the Defence Staff by General Sir Nicholas Houghton on 18 July 2013. Later life Richards worked as a consultant for the government of the United Arab Emirates and has advised American arms company DynCorp. From October 2013, Richards has worked as a Senior Adviser to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Richards is a patron of the Armed Forces Muslim Association. On 26 June 2014, Richards said that Britain's Armed Forces will be like a \\"banana republic\\" if the Ministry of Defence kept cutting costs, and criticised the \\"bean counters\\" who cut perks for his successors. He is believed to have said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond \\"would never be a good soldier\\". Richards was concerned about a controversial plan to replace regular troops with reservists. On pay to soldiers, he said: On 7 October 2014, Richards criticised the contemporary Western strategy employed to defeat ISIS.

It is located just west of Usselo. The village is known for the Military Boekelo Enschede, an international equestrian event. It is also known for the salt industry, since 1919 located south of the village. This was a reason for the then well- known Bad Boekelo (Bath Boekelo) to have a salt water wave pool. After the opening of the Twentekanaal (Twente canal) the factory of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Zoutindustrie (Royal Dutch Salt-industry) was moved to Hengelo; currently it is called Akzo Nobel. Textile industry flourished in Boekelo: The N.V. Boekelosche Stoombleekerij (public LLC Boekelo's Steam-bleachery), founded in 1888 by Gerrit Jan van Heek, was taken over by Unilever (who fused it with P. Fenter van Vlissingen & Co's Katoenfabrieken N.V.). On the former factory's terrain, a new quarter called De Bleekerij (The Bleachery) was built. Parts of the old industrial heritage such as old facades and the factory's chimney were integrated into the new buildings. The internationally known beer brewery Grolsch moved to Boekelo, abandoning its factories in Groenlo and Enschede. The Museum Buurtspoorweg (lit. Museum Neighborhood- railway) runs a historical museum railway with restored steam locomotives and wagons between Boekelo and Haaksbergen. Geography The village layout clearly shows the now abandoned verzuiling of the Dutch society. The village consists of two population centers, one in the east (Protestant) and one in the west (Catholic). The two parts of the village are separated by the \\"Boekelerbeek\\" (Boekelo's stream) and some fields. Originally the parts each had their own church, elementary school, barber, grocery store and pub. The only factories were in the eastern part. When the verzuiling disappeared, the shops gradually lost their distinct Catholic or Protestant clientele. In time, the catholic elementary school moved to the east part, the west grocery store closed and the west pub became a liquor store. New stores opened and new houses were built in the east part. At present the east part is considered the center of the village, it covers an area approximately ten times as large as the western part. In Twente's bocage lie historical estates, among others Hof te Boekelo (an original manor house from 1570), De Weele, Zonnebeek en 't Stroot.

He emigrated at a young age to Italy where he played an important role in the development of the style of decorative Baroque still lifes.John T. Spike, Italian still life paintings from three centuries, National Academy of Design (U.S.), Philbrook Art Center, Dayton Art Institute, Centro Di, 1983, p. 16-17 Life =Early life= Abraham was born in Antwerp, the son of Jan Brueghel the Younger, the grandson of Jan Brueghel the Elder and the great-grandson of Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Much of his artistic training came from his father Jan Brueghel the Younger, prolific painter and regular collaborator with Rubens. Abraham showed great promise as an artist from an early age, and started to make a name for himself in his teenage years. His father sold one of Abraham's floral still lives when he was only 15 years old. =Move to Italy= Woman grasping fruits In 1649, at the age of 18, Abraham went to Italy to complete a commission for Prince Antonio Ruffo in Sicily. It was the first of many commissions in which Abraham demonstrated his artistic abilities in drawing floral still lifes. Already in 1649 an inventory of his patron Prince Antonio Ruffo records nine flower paintings by the 18-year-old artist.Abraham Brueghel, A still life of a watermelon, cherries, peaches, apricots, plums, pomegranates and figs, with lilies, roses, morning glory and other flowers on an acanthus stone relief at Colnaghi Ten years later, in 1659, Brueghel moved to Rome, Italy where he married an Italian woman less than a year later. In 1670 he was invited into the Accademia di San Luca, a Roman academy, which had as its objective the elevation of the work of artists. Abraham joined the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. It was customary for the Bentvueghels to adopt an appealing nickname, the so-called 'bent name'. He was given the bent name Rijngraaf, meaning 'duke of the Rhine', which was an old aristocratic title in Germany. When Abraham Genoels joined the Bentvueghels in 1670, Abraham Brueghel signed the bentbrief as \\"Abraham Breugel\\".Abraham Breugel, Ryngraaf in Arnold Houbraken's Schouwburg, Volume 2, p 351 Some time between 1672 and 1675, Abraham left Rome and moved to Naples, Italy. He played an important role in the development of still life painting in Naples, which had before his arrival in the city resisted the Flemish-Roman style of decorative still lifes. Breughel remained in Naples until his death. He is believed to have died c. 1690 in Naples and in any event no later than 1697.Abraham Brueghel at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work A still life of fruit and flowers in a landscape Abraham Brueghel established a reputation for his still lifes and in particular, floral still lives. One hunting still life signed and dated by him is known. Due to the lack of evolution during the artist's mature period and the scarcity of dated works, it is difficult to establish a chronology of Abraham's artistic development. His brushstrokes were generally slightly more painterly during his Roman period, while his palette became brighter and stronger during his later years. The increasingly lush still lifes of the Flemish painters Frans Snyders, Jan Fyt and Pieter Boel who had also worked in Italy were the principal influences on Abraham Brueghel. Joannes Hermans, another Flemish painter in Rome also painted grandiose still lifes combining human figures, flowers and fruit, which anticipated the arrival in Rome in 1653 of Abraham Brueghel.Natura viva, Coppia di dipinti ad olio su tela attribuiti a Joannes Hermans at the Associaz Cultur. Antonello Governale Brueghel combined the Flemish preference for decorative profusion and anecdote with the sweeping movement of the Italian High Baroque of his Italian contemporaries, such as Michele Pace del Campidoglio and Michelangelo Cerquozzi. The result of the complementary influences were compositions that appear casual, while maintaining strong composition and clarity of detail. Young woman picking figs with three children in a terraced garden, with Nicola Vaccaro Abraham Brueghel is especially known for his still life paintings of southern fruits and flowers, which were typically assembled in front of a landscape. They are frequently enhanced by a precious vase, an antique monument or fragments of Roman sculpture. His cartouches are heavier and more decorative.Marie-Louise Hairs, Dominique Finet, The Flemish Flower Painters in the XVIIth Century, International Specialized Book Service Incorporated, 1985, p. 248 He often collaborated with other specialist painters to create complex Baroque compositions. He usually painted the landscapes in these collaborations himself while the staffage was created by well-known Italian painters, such as Carlo Maratta, Giovanni Battista Gaulli, Nicola Vaccaro and Giacinto Brandi.Abraham Brueghel on Hadrianus A few collaborations between Abraham Brueghel and Guillaume Courtois, a French painter active in Rome, are recorded. An example is the Still life of fruits and flowers with a figure (Sold at Sotheby's on 29 January 2015 in New York, lot 302). The still life was painted by Brueghel while Courtois painted the figure. The painting is a variant of the Grapes and pomegranate with a vase of flowers and a female figure (private collection), which has been dated to the end of the 1660s.Still life of fruits and flowers with a figure at Sotheby's Flower garland and marine landscape of the Golf of Gaeta, with Gennaro Greco He also collaborated with specialist landscape and vedute painters to create collaborative works combining landscape and still life painting. An example is the Flower garland and marine landscape of the Golf of Gaeta, a collaboration with vedute painter Gennaro Greco. It shows in the centre a harbour scene with figures in the foreground which is surrounded by a flower garland. The work is characteristic of late 17th century Neapolitan painting which aimed almost exclusively at ornamental and decorative effect rather than at naturalism.Abraham Brueghel and Gennaro Greco, Flower garland and marine landscape of the Golf of Gaeta at Lopez de Aragon gallery This type of painting falls into the category of 'garland paintings', a type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp by Abraham's grandfather Jan Brueghel the Elder. It became popular and leading Flemish still life painters, in particular Daniel Seghers, helped spread the genre abroad. Paintings in this genre initially showed a flower or, less frequently, a fruit garland surrounding a devotional image.

Eorpwald was a member of the East Anglian dynasty known as the Wuffingas, named after the semi-historical king Wuffa. Little is known of Eorpwald's life or of his short reign, as little documentary evidence about the East Anglian kingdom has survived. The primary source for Eorpwald is the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written by Bede in the 8th century. Soon after becoming king, Eorpwald received Christian teaching and was baptised in 627 or 632. Soon after his conversion he was killed by Ricberht, a pagan noble, who may have succeeded him and ruled for three years. The motive for Eorpwald's assassination was probably political as well as religious. He was the first early English king to suffer death as a consequence of his Christian faith and was subsequently venerated by the Church as a saint and martyr. In 1939, a magnificent ship-burial was discovered under a large mound at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk. Although Rædwald is usually considered to have been buried with the ship (or commemorated by it), another possibility is Eorpwald. Alternatively, he might also have had his own ship-burial nearby. Background and family A map showing the general locations of the Anglo-Saxon peoples around the year 600 By the beginning of the 7th century, southern England was almost entirely under the control of the Anglo-Saxons.Hunter Blair, Roman Britain and Early England: 55 B.C. – A.D. 871, p. 204. Peter Hunter Blair gives the twenty-five years from 550 to 575 as the dates of the final conquest. These peoples, who are known to have included Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the conquered territories, including the Kingdom of the East Angles, an Anglo-Saxon kingdom which today includes the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 1. Almost no documentary sources exist about the history of the kingdom before the reign of Rædwald, who reigned until about 624.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 70. Sources of information include the names of a few of the early Wuffing kings, mentioned in a short passage in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in the 730s.Carver, The age of Sutton Hoo: the seventh century in north-western Europe, p. 4. In 616, Rædwald defeated and killed Æthelfrith of Northumbria in the Battle of the River Idle and then installed Edwin as the new Deiran king. Whilst Edwin had been an exile at Rædwald's court, he had had a dream where he was told that if he converted to Christianity, he would become greater than any that had ruled before him. Steven Plunkett relates that, according to the version of events as told in the Whitby Life of St Gregory, it was Paulinus who visited Edwin and obtained his promise to convert to Christianity in return for regal power.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 79-80. After Edwin emerged as the ruler of Deira, with its centre at York, he became accepted as king of the northern Northumbrian province of Bernicia.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 79. Following his victory over the Northumbrians, Rædwald was not only king of the East Angles, but also the most powerful king amongst the rulers of the various English kingdoms, occupying the role which was later described by the term Bretwalda. He is thought by many to have been buried in the sumptuous ship burial at Sutton Hoo.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 81, 82. Eorpwald was the son of Rædwald by a wife whose name is not recorded. He had at least one brother, Rægenhere, and another sibling, Sigeberht, may also have been his brother. Rædwald used the letters R and E when naming two of his own sons (as did his own father when he and his younger brother Eni were named), which suggests that Eorpwald was the younger sibling and would only have become Rædwald's heir after his elder brother Rægenhere was slain in battle in 616.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 72. It is unclear whether, as Bede understood, Sigebert and Eorpwald were brothers, or whether they shared the same mother but not the same father, as was stated by the 12th-century chronicler William of Malmesbury. According to the historian Barbara Yorke, Sigebert may have been a member of a different line of Wuffings who, as his rival, was forced into exile, in order to ensure that Eorpwald became king.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 67-68. Accession and conversion to Christianity Eorpwald was still a pagan when he became king of the East Angles, following the death of Rædwald in around 624. D. P. Kirby maintains that Sigeberht fled from East Anglia to Gaul during the internal strife that followed Eorpwald's accession and that the new king's paganism created tension between Christian and pagan factions within the kingdom, which resulted in a reduction in his influence.Kirby, The Earliest English Kings, p.63. In 627, Edwin undertook the conversion of the peoples of Northumbria, Lindsey and East AngliaHoggett, The Archaeology of the East Anglian Conversion, p. 30. and at his prompting Eorpwald was, according to Bede, \\"persuaded to accept the Christian faith and sacraments\\".Bede, The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Book II, chapter 15. It can be calculated that this event occurred in 627, taking into account the years that Felix of Burgundy was known to have held the East Anglian bishopric.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 97–98.Higham, The convert kings: power and religious affiliation in early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 181. In contrast, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Eorpwald's baptism took place during 632: \\"Her wæs Eorpwald gefullod\\", (\\"Here Eorpwald was baptized\\").Swanton, The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 24: Swanton adds in Note 5, 'King of the East Anglians'.Piers Plowman Electronic Archive Project version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Wilson, Anglo-Saxon: Art From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest, p. 25. It is not known whether Eorpwald was baptised in East Anglia, Northumbria or Kent, but it is very likely that Edwin, now the senior ruler, was present as his sponsor. Higham suggests that because of the lack of proper facilities in East Anglia, it is likely that he was baptised by Paulinus at Edwin's centre of authority in Northumbria.Higham, The convert kings: power and religious affiliation in early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 102. The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord. Following his baptism, Edwin's Northumbrian priests were in a position to be able to suppress pagan practices in Eorpwald's kingdom and convert the East Anglians.Higham, The convert kings: power and religious affiliation in early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 103. The conversion had the general political benefit of bringing the entire eastern seaboard from Northumbria to Kent, with the exception of Essex, under the dominion of Edwin and his Christian allies.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 99 Death and sainthood The conversion of Eorpwald's kingdom did not result in the establishment of any ecclesiastical infrastructure, such as the establishment of a see within the kingdom. Bede reported that soon after his conversion, Eorpwald was slain (occisus) by a heathen (uiro gentili) named Ricberht and that after he was killed, the kingdom reverted to heathen rule (in errore uersata est) for three years. Eorpwald was the first English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The circumstances are not recorded, so that it is not known whether Ricberht represented an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule does not necessarily mean that there was an overt struggle between the worship of the Anglo-Saxon gods and the worship of Christ, but could express a reaction against Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king.Higham, The convert kings: power and religious affiliation in early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 182. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, pp.61, 62, 67. At Sutton Hoo (near Woodbridge, in Suffolk) is the site of two 6th-7th century Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, where it is believed that members of Eorpwald's dynasty were entombed under large earth mounds. Several East Anglian kings, including Eorpwald, have been suggested as possible candidates for the occupant of the burial site under Mound 1, discovered in 1939. Martin Carver has speculated that historians could use regal lists and other sources of information to identify the occupants, whilst acknowledging that no material evidence exists to support the theory that Eorpwald or other members of his family are buried there. He has used Eorpwald's relationship as the son of Rædwald to place him in either Mound 1 or 2.Carver, Sutton Hoo: Burial Ground of Kings?, p. 172. According to Fleming's Complete History of the British Martyrs, published in 1904, King Eorpwald was venerated as a saint and a martyr by the English Church. His feast day is not known.Fleming, Complete History of the British Martyrs, p. 20.

Early life He was born in the small parish of Mourne Abbey in County Cork, Ireland on 4 May 1934, one of five children of farmers Daniel and Sheila O'Donoghue. O'Donoghue came to Britain in 1959 to train for the priesthood first at Campion House, Osterley, Middlesex, then from 1961 to 1967 at Allen Hall seminary when it was at St Edmund's, Ware. He was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Westminster in England on 25 May 1967. Episcopal career He was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster and Titular Bishop of Tulana on 18 May 1993. His consecration to the episcopate took place on 29 June 1993, the principal consecrator was Basil Hume, Cardinal-Archbishop of Westminster and the principal co-consecrators were John Patrick Crowley, Bishop of Middlesbrough and Patrick Joseph Casey, Bishop Emeritus of Brentwood. Following of the sudden death of John Brewer while in office, O'Donoghue was appointed the Bishop of Lancaster on 5 June 2001, and installed at St Peter's Cathedral, Lancaster on 4 July 2001. His portrait was painted for Westminster Cathedral in 2002 by Christian Furr.Christian Furr – Biography . Retrieved on 13 June 2001. =Diocesan situation= In recent years he has led a major diocesan review of the diocese called Fit for Mission? to prepare the diocese for the future with fewer priests and practising Catholics and attempting to encourage all Catholics to be more missionary-focussed. =Catholic schools= In November 2007, he brought out his teaching document on Catholic education, Fit for Mission? – Schools. Hailed in the Catholic press as 'groundbreaking' and 'courageous', it was also praised by the Holy See. The Congregation for Clergy 'hopes it will become an example for other Dioceses in the country in their implementation of the General Directory for Catechesis and the Catechism of the Catholic Church', and the Congregation for Catholic Education wrote, it will undoubtedly be a reliable resource for renewing the vitality of Catholic Education in today's society. O'Donoghue was an opponent of attempts to secularise the culture of Catholic schools in the Diocese of Lancaster. For instance, he gave instructions to the schools to halt promotion of contraceptives, remove anti-Catholic books from their libraries and prevent the presentation of ideas contrary to the Catholic Church's official teaching. Some secularist critics, such as Barry Sheerman, a Labour MP and Steve Sinnott of the National Union of Teachers attacked him for his advocation of a Catholic education in Catholic schools. =Catholic Caring Services= In October 2008 he came into direct conflict with trustees of the local Catholic- founded adoption agency, Catholic Caring Services (CCS), which was attempting to enact homosexual adoption contrary to Church teachings, following the UK government's Sexual Orientation Regulations. In a letter to the agency he threatened them with eviction from church property, warned that he would sue the CCS for money left in wills by Catholics to the agency if they did not change their stance within one week, threatened to inform the Charities Commission that the organisation was no longer Catholic, and would break its link with the Lancaster diocese: > I find it unthinkable, indeed heart-breaking, that Catholic Caring Services, > so linked to the Catholic Church since its inception, would abandon its > position and capitulate to recent same-sex adoption legislation. Retirement O'Donoghue retired on 1 May 2009, with a special Mass at St Peter's Cathedral, Lancaster, and assumed the title Bishop Emeritus of Lancaster. He left the Diocese of Lancaster on 29 May 2009 and retired as an assistant priest to the parish of Bantry on the west coast of County Cork, Ireland.

The company produced 3211,000 tonnes of urea, which includes 10.83 LMT of Neem-coated urea. 448 MT of bio-fertilizers (solid and liquid) was produced during the year. =Sales and marketing= During 2012–13, company sold 31.62 LMT of urea (including 10.92 LMT of Neem-coated urea). Industrial products of worth \` 956.3 million and Bio-Fertilizers (liquid and solid) of\` 36.5 million were sold during 2012–13. Turnover of traded Agri products (compost, seeds, Bentonite sulphur and pesticides) was \` 300.8 million. =Financial= The company, during 2012–13, achieved a sales turnover of \` 67.47 billion (previous year \` 73.41 billion). The lower turnover was primarily due to lower urea production as all the units were under shutdown for hooking up and commissioning activities of the projects. The loss before tax was \` 2306.2 million (previous year profit \`1842.0 million) and loss after tax was \` 1707.3 million (previous year profit \`1267.3 million). The main reasons for loss were due to the following: 1) Lower production / sale because of shut-downs taken for commissioning of urea capacity enhancement projects at Vijaipur and changeover of feedstock from Fuel-oil to natural gas at Nangal, Bathinda and Panipat Units. 2) Decrease in sale and contribution of industrial products due to non-availability of cheaper ammonia, non-availability of gases, Sulphur and Argon gas at three Fuel-oil based Units post commissioning. 3) Provision for purchase tax liability pertaining to previous years. 4) Higher interest expenditure mainly due to delay in receipt of subsidy. Some of the major strategic issues affecting the profitability of the company include: 1) Non-allocation of domestic gas for operation of FO-based plants converted on natural gas at Panipat, Bathinda and Nangal Units. 2) Non-revision of concessional price for existing capacity of urea by updation of fixed cost in NPS-III. 3) Timely release of urea subsidy from GoI.

Early life and education  Hodgson was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in 1798, to Robert Hodgson Sr. and Rebecca Robinson, the former being a member of the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island and public speaker who died while Hodgson Jr. was a child. His family was Anglican and Hodgson was the oldest of a total of 5 children, 3 sons and a daughter. Hodgson moved to Windsor, Nova Scotia to complete his education, going to the University of King's College. He then traveled to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Simon Bradstreet Robie and James William Johnston helped him study law. He later returned to Charlottetown and became a politician and lawyer. In Charlottetown, Hodgson had a wife, Fanny McDonell, whom he married in 1827. After having 3 children, two daughters and a son, McDonell died 5 years after their marriage, on 2 May 1832; Hodgson did not marry again after her death.  Career  In 1819, Hodgon became a part of the Bar of Nova Scotia, as well as the Bar of Prince Edward Island. In 1824, Hodgson successfully contested an assembly seat in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. He became the land owner of several businesses, often working with John Lawson. Hodgson became the temporary attorney general of Prince Edward Island in May 1828, after the death of William Johnston, the previous attorney of the colony; this was switched to a permanent appointment in 1829. Hodgson also became the advocate general, surrogate, and judge of probate of the island in 1828. Hodgson became the president of the Legislative Council of Prince Edward Island in 1840, after serving in that council, as well as the Executive Council, since 1829. He became a temporary chief justice of the island in 1841. In 1850, reformers of Prince Edward Island asked if Hodgson would join them, stating that they would allow him to keep both of his positions in office. However, he refused, and in 1851, the reformers ended up taking power of the island. At this point, Hodgson resigned from his attorney general position and his Executive Council seat, but kept his position as president of the Legislative Council for the next year. After agreeing to not accept any office of payment controlled by the island's government, Hodgson received a grant of £200 a year, for his work as attorney general. On 26 May 1852, he was appointed chief justice of Prince Edward Island by the executive council; the governor, Alexander Bannerman, believed that Hodgson had \\"a thorough knowledge of Colonial & Constitutional law.\\" Throughout his time as chief justice, he performed as an administrator of the island several times during Dundas's absences from governor. He was selected to be the judge of the Court of Vice-Admiralty in 1853. His first period serving as an administrator was in 1865, from July – December, during which time disputes over land were occurring. The members of the Tenant League, a populist league which wanted to demolish the proprietary land system, would not pay landlords their rent. This issue became so severe that soldiers were sent to restore order by Hodgson. This proved to be successful, and the action was praised by the press of the island and London. Hodgson was knighted in 1869, along with William Young. Also in 1869, Hodgon requested to be the lieutenant governor of the island, but was unsuccessful, with William C. F. Robinson becoming the lieutenant governor instead. However, Hodgson did become the lieutenant governor in 1874; the previous year, Robinson had resigned his position and left the island. Hodgson served as lieutenant governor until 1879, when he retired. He died on 15—16 September 1880, a year after his retirement, when he was 82 years old.

It was built in 1939 as a Works Progress Administration project and has been used for Alabama basketball, women's sports (in the 1970s and 1980s), graduations, lectures, concerts, and other large gatherings, including registration. Its status as the largest indoor building on campus came to an end in 1968 with the opening of the Memorial Coliseum. The building housed the Department of Kinesiology until 2006. In April 2009, the University announced a major renovation for the auditorium. After the renovation, the Crimson Tide women's basketball and volleyball programs moved back to Foster Auditorium, their original home. The facility is named for Richard Clarke Foster, president of the University of Alabama from 1937 to 1941. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark on April 5, 2005, for its role as the site of Governor George Wallace's \\"Stand in the Schoolhouse Door\\" opposing actions to desegregate the university. Sports history Foster Auditorium was the site of a full court shot during the January 4, 1955 basketball game between the University of Alabama and the University of North Carolina. Alabama player George Linn made the 84 foot 11 inch shot at the end of the first half. The shot was featured in Sports Illustrated, and is commemorated at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. A brass marker was placed in the gym floor to indicate the location of the shot. Stand in the Schoolhouse Door Vivian Malone arriving to register for classes at the University of Alabama's Foster Auditorium in 1963. More than any other event, Foster Auditorium is known as the site of the \\"Stand in the Schoolhouse Door\\" incident. On June 11, 1963, Governor George C. Wallace, making good on a campaign pledge to not allow integration of the university, stood in the doorway of the building on the day of registration. He was attempting to block two black students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, from enrolling at the university. President John F. Kennedy called on the Alabama National Guard to forcibly allow the students to enter the building if need be. Calling it \\"an unwelcomed, unwanted, unwarranted and force-induced intrusion upon the campus,\\" Wallace denounced the actions, but, seeing as he could not win against the combined efforts of the Guard, federal marshals and Deputy United States Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, Wallace stepped aside, returning to the state capital as Malone and Hood entered for registration. The incident is seen as one of the seminal events in the Civil Rights Movement in America. The scene was depicted (with artistic liberties taken) in the 1994 film Forrest Gump. The courtyard at the auditorium's rear entrance (the actual \\"schoolhouse door\\" in which Wallace stood, as opposed to its front facade, where white students were allowed to enter) was dedicated in 2013 as the Malone-Hood Plaza in honor of James Hood and Vivian Malone. The Plaza is the site of the Autherine Lucy Clock Tower, named for the first black student to attend the University.

Little is known of his life or his reign. According to Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Ricberht murdered Eorpwald of East Anglia in about 627, shortly after Eorpwald succeeded his father Rædwald as king and had then been baptised as a Christian. Following Eorpwald's death, Ricberht may have become king, a possibility that is not mentioned by Bede or any contemporary commentator. East Anglia then reverted to paganism for three years, before Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded jointly as kings of East Anglia and ended the kingdom's brief period of apostasy.  Background  North and east England in the 7th century The earliest East Anglian kings were pagans. They belonged to the Wuffingas dynasty, named after Wuffa, whose ancestors originated from northern Europe and whose descendants ruled the East Angles in an almost unbroken line until after the reign of Ælfwald in the middle of the 8th century. When East Anglia was first mentioned by Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, it was a powerful kingdom ruled by Rædwald (died about 624). According to Bede, Rædwald was recognised as exercising dominance or imperium over the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, a position that was assured when he gave his loyalty and support to Edwin of Northumbria (who was at that time a fugitive at the East Anglian court) and together they defeated Æthelfrith of Northumbria on the banks of the River Idle, a tributary of the Trent. Rædwald was converted to Christianity in Kent at the invitation of King Æthelberht, but, under the influence of his pagan wife, his church contained both a Christian and a pagan altar. Upon his death in around 624, Rædwald was succeeded by his surviving son Eorpwald, who was then converted to the Christian faith shortly after becoming king. According to the historian N. J. Higham, Edwin of Northumbria and Paulinus of York, Edwin's bishop, were able to persuade Eorpwald to accept an \\"alien cult\\" whose authority rested outside East Anglia. Eorpwald may have been sponsored by King Edwin at his baptism, which would have resulted in Edwin being acknowledged as Eorpwald's lord. The East Angles may also have been baptised as a people, which would have undermined Eorpwald's authority as king and acted against the authority of any long-established pagan cults.  The assassination of Eorpwald  A depiction of Eorpwald's death, by John Speed Soon after his conversion, Eorpwald was killed by Ricberht, possibly as the result of a pagan reaction to the East Anglian conversion. Nothing about Ricberht's ancestry or background is known, although his name can be taken to imply that he was a member of the East Anglian elite and was perhaps related to Eorpwald. The single source for Ricberht, Bede's Ecclesiastical History, states that \\"Eorpwald, not long after he had embraced the Christian faith, was slain by one Ricberht, a pagan;\\" (\\"Uerum Eorpuald non multo, postquam fidem accepit, tempore occisus est a uiro gentili nomine Ricbercto;\\"). It is not known where Eorpwald's murder occurred, nor any other details surrounding his death.  Rule  Historians generally maintain that Ricberht, if he became king at all, succeeded Eorpwald and ruled for three years. Bede does not mention him again, only noting that \\"the province was in error for three years\\" (\\"et exinde tribus annis prouincia in errore uersata est\\"), prior to the accession of Eorpwald's half-brother (or brother) Sigeberht and his kinsman Ecgric. Scholars have been unable to determine the regnal dates of several kings of this period, including that of Ricberht, with any certainty. Higham surmises that Ricberht's ability to rule for three years, at a time when Edwin was overlord among the Anglo-Saxons, implies that Ricberht was supported by the East Angles in overthrowing Eorpwald, whom they regarded as \\"overly compliant\\" towards the Northumbrian king. It has been speculated by Michael Wood and other historians that Ricberht may have been interred in the Sutton Hoo ship- burial near the Wuffingas centre of authority at Rendlesham, but most experts consider Rædwald to be a more likely candidate. Martin Carver has used the evidence of what he identifies as iconic pagan practices at Sutton Hoo to theorise that the ship burial represents one example of pagan defiance \\"provoked by the perceived menace of a predatory Christian mission\\".  Successors  In about 630, Christianity was permanently re-established in East Anglia when Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded to rule jointly. Ecgric, who may have been a sub-king until the abdication of Sigeberht in around 634, seems to have remained a pagan. There is no evidence that Ecgric adopted or promoted Christianity: Bede wrote nothing to imply that he was a Christian, in contrast to his praise of the devout Sigeberht, the first English king to receive a Christian baptism and education before his succession.

It is also the seat of the Schwaan Township, serving another six municipalities. The town is famous for being a traditional art colony. Geography The area around Schwaan is part of the vast North European Plain, stretching from western France to Russia. Schwaan lies on the lower Warnow river between the cities of Rostock, 17 km to the north, and Güstrow, 20 km to the south. The higher ground to the east and west of the Warnow barely reaches 50 meters above sea level, and the area north to the Baltic Sea is flat. The nearby villages of Bandow, Dorf Tatschow, Hof Tatschow and Letschow belong to Schwaan. History Town hall and St. Paul's of Schwaan The area around the Warnow was originally populated by Slavic peoples, which one can still recognize in place and farm names. Schwaan was first mentioned as a town in a record from 1276. In 1765 a great fire destroyed the entire town except for St. Paul’s Church and a mill. The town was rebuilt in the classical style, especially the townhouses which can be seen today. In the 19th century, Schwaan was a small country town and the market for the surrounding communities of the Schwaan township. The construction of the railway line from Hamburg to Rostock through Schwaan in 1850 brought an economic boom. The city hall was built only five years later in the neo-Gothic style. With the coming of the railroad, the town became a getaway destination for residents of the city of Rostock. In 1911 a lung sanatorium was built, which was later expanded into a tuberculosis and rehabilitation clinic. In 1928 the first river bathing resort in Germany was built on the Warnow. During the World War II Schwaan suffered no damage from bombing, but the Warnow bridge, built in 1828, was dynamited shortly before the end of the war. Since German reunification in October 1990, the historic center of the town has been completely rehabilitated through an urban renewal program of the German government. Sister cities Since 1990 Schwaan has had a partnership with Loxstedt, south of Bremerhaven in Lower Saxony. Coat of arms The emblem of a swan on a blue shield originated as a town road sign and has represented Schwaan since before 1606 when it first appeared as the town seal. Blazon: “In Azure a dexter sweeping Argent swan with Or beak and Or feet and with Or ducally gorged.” Culture and Attractions Schwaan Art Museum at the Water Mill Art Museum at the Water Mill: the Museum of Art present works of art from Mecklenburg. A special emphasis is put on the work of the painters Franz Bunke, Rudolf Bartels, Peter Paul Draewing (all from Schwaan) and Alfred Heinsohn (of Hamburg). In the market place is the war memorial for the victims of 1870-71, constructed in 1895. On its front is a relief medallion of Frederick Francis IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, created by the sculptor Hermann Hultzsch. The monument is crowned by an Iron Cross. Transport Schwaan is located on the Rostock-Güstrow and Rostock-Bützow- Schwerin railway lines. The town is well connected to the national highway network, with Bundesautobahn 19 (comparable to a freeway, expressway or interstate highway) and Bundesautobahn 20 about 15 km to the north and east. Also to the east, about 16 km, is the Rostock-Laage Airport. PersonalitiesFranz Bunke (b. December 3, 1857 in Schwaan; d.

It dates to the early eleventh century. Description The runestone was discovered in 1883 in a field at Skarpåker, but in 1883 was moved to Lindö and then moved to its current location in that city in 1928. The Skarpåker Stone is 1.8 meters in height and notable for a skaldic younger futhark inscription in two, nearly-identical lines. The eschatology of the verse, \\"the Earth shall be rent, and the heavens above\\", apparently expressing a father's devastation at the loss of his son, may be compared to the father's lament in the Sonatorrek. It also evokes the catastrophic end of the world in Germanic mythology, described in the Poetic Edda as Ragnarök and also alluded to in the Muspilli. The phrase \\"heavens above\\" or \\"high heaven\\" is used in three existing skaldic poems and in Old Saxon and Old English religious poetry as well as on the charm on the Ribe runic healing stick DR EM85;493, with \\"earth and high heaven\\" apparently a common Germanic poetic phrase. pp. 413-14. The line on the Skarpåker Stone also invokes the following lines from the third stanza of the Völuspá: :::Of old was the age  when Ymir lived; :::Sea nor cool waves  nor sand there were; :::Earth had not been,  nor heaven above, :::But a yawning gap,  and grass nowhere. The text is carved on a serpent who arches over a depiction of a ship with a cross as its mast. Other runic inscriptions from the Viking Age that depict ships include DR 77 in Hjermind, DR 119 in Spentrup, DR 220 in Sønder Kirkeby, DR 258 in Bösarp, DR 271 in Tullstorp, DR 328 in Holmby, DR EM85;523 in Farsø, Ög 181 in Ledberg, Ög 224 in Stratomta, Ög MÖLM1960;230 in Törnevalla, Sö 122 in Skresta, Sö 158 in Österberga, Sö 164 in Spånga, Sö 351 in Överjärna, Sö 352 in Linga, Vg 51 in Husaby, U 370 in Herresta, U 979 in Gamla Uppsala, U 1052 in Axlunda, U 1161 in Altuna, and Vs 17 in Råby. Three stones, the Hørdum and Långtora kyrka stones and U 1001 in Rasbo, depict ships, but currently do not have any runes on them and may never have had any. While including older pagan references in the runic text, the overall theme of the inscription on the Skarpåker Stone, with the ship and cross, is Christian. p. 63-65. The inscription on the Skarpåker Stone has been attributed to a runemaster named Traen,Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for Sö 154. and is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr1, which also is known as the Ringerike style.

The term includes buildings which were constructed within the current borders of Spain prior to its existence as a nation, when the land was called Iberia, Hispania, Al-Andalus or was divided between several Christian kingdoms. Drawing from many different sources, Spanish architecture demonstrates great historical and geographical diversity. Spanish architecture tended to develop along similar lines as other architectural styles around the Mediterranean and from Northern Europe. A real development came with the arrival of the Romans, who left behind some of their most outstanding monuments in Hispania. The arrival of the Visigoths brought about a profound decline in building techniques which was paralleled in the rest of the former Roman Empire. The Muslim conquest in 711 CE led to a radical change and for the following eight centuries there were great advances in culture, including architecture. For example, Córdoba was established as the cultural capital of its time under the Umayyad dynasty. Simultaneously, the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles, at first mostly isolated from European architectural influences, and later integrated into Romanesque and Gothic streams, they reached an extraordinary peak with numerous samples along the whole territory. The Mudéjar style, from the 12th to 17th centuries, was characterised by the blending of cultural European and Islamic influences. Towards the end of the 15th century, and before influencing Latin America with its Colonial architecture, Spain itself experimented with Renaissance architecture, developed mostly by local architects. Spanish Baroque was distinguished by its exuberant Churrigueresque decoration and the most sober Herrerian style, both developing separately from later international influences. The Colonial style, which has lasted for centuries, still has a strong influence in Latin America. Neoclassicism reached its peak in the work of Juan de Villanueva and his disciples. The 19th century had two faces: the engineering efforts to achieve a new language and bring about structural improvements using iron and glass as the main building materials, and the academic focus, firstly on revivals and eclecticism, and later on regionalism. The arrival of Modernisme in the academic arena produced figures such as Gaudí and much of the architecture of the 20th century. The International style was led by groups like GATEPAC. Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in contemporary architecture and Spanish architects like Rafael Moneo, Santiago Calatrava, Ricardo Bofill as well as many others have gained worldwide renown. Many architectural sites in Spain, and even portions of cities, have been designated World Heritage sites by UNESCO. Spain has the third highest number of World Heritage Sites in the world; only Italy and China have more. These are listed at List of World Heritage Sites in Europe: Spain. Prehistory =Megalithic architecture= Naveta d'Es Tudons, in Menorca In the Stone Age, the most common megalith found in the Iberian Peninsula was the dolmen. The plans of these funerary chambers used to be pseudocircles or trapezoids, formed by huge stones stuck on the ground, and others over them, forming the roof. As the typology evolved, an entrance corridor appeared, and gradually took prominence and became almost as wide as the chamber. Roofed corridors and false domes were common in the most advanced stage. The complex of Antequera contains the largest dolmens in Europe. The best preserved, the Cueva de Menga, is twenty-five metres deep and four metres high, and was built with thirty-two megaliths. The best preserved examples of architecture from the Bronze Age are located in the Balearic Islands, where three kinds of construction appeared: the T-shaped taula, the talayot and the naveta. The talayots were troncoconical or troncopiramidal defensive towers. They used to have a central pillar. The navetas, were constructions made of great stones and their shape was similar to a ship hull. =Iberian and Celtic architecture= Galicia: Castro de Baroña The most characteristic constructions of the Celts were the castros, walled villages usually on the top of hills or mountains. They were developed at the areas occupied by the Celts in the Douro valley and in Galicia. Examples include Las Cogotas, in Ávila, the Castro of Santa Tecla, in Pontevedra in Spain. In Portugal these include Citânia de Briteiros in Braga, Citânia de Santa Luzia in Viana do Castelo and Citânia de Sanfins in Paços de Ferreira. The houses inside the castros are about 3.5 to 5 meters long, mostly circular with some rectangular, stone-made and with thatch roofs which rested on a wood column in the centre of the building. Their streets are somewhat regular, suggesting some form of central organization. The towns built by the Arévacos were related to Iberian culture, and some of them reached notable urban development like Numantia. Others were more primitive and usually excavated into the rock, like Termantia. Roman =Urban development= Roman theater in Mérida The Roman conquest, started in 218 BC, promoted the almost complete romanization of the Iberian Peninsula. Roman culture was fully assimilated by the local population. Former military camps and Iberian, Phoenician and Greek settlements were transformed into large cities where urbanization highly developed in the provinces; Augusta Emerita in the Lusitania, Corduba, Italica, Hispalis, Gades in the Hispania Baetica, Tarraco, Caesar Augusta, Asturica Augusta, Legio Septima Gemina and Lucus Augusti in the Hispania Tarraconensis were some of the most important cities, linked by a complex network of roads. The construction development includes some monuments of comparable quality to those of the capital, Rome.Chueca Goitia, Fernando. De Grecia al Islam. Seminarios y Ediciones, 1974. Pages 172-174, 179 DOSSAT, 2000, =Constructions= Alcántara Bridge, of Trajan epoque Roman civil engineering is represented in imposing constructions such as the Aqueduct of Segovia and the Acueducto de los Milagros in Mérida, in bridges like the Alcántara Bridge, Puente Romano over Guadiana River, and the Roman bridge of Córdoba over the Guadalquivir. Civil works were widely developed in Hispania under Emperor Trajan (98-117 AD). Lighthouses like the one still in use Hercules Tower in A Coruña, were also built. Tarragona Amphitheatre and the Mediterranean Sea Ludic architecture is represented by such buildings as the theatres of Mérida, Sagunto, Cádiz, Cartagena, and Tarraco, amphitheaters in Mérida, Italica, Tarraco or Segóbriga, and circuses in Mérida, Toledo, and many others. Religious architecture also spread thougout the Peninsula; examples include the Roman temples of Barcelona, Córdoba, Vic, and Alcántara, The main funerary monuments are the Torre dels Escipions in Tarraco, the distyle in Zalamea de la Serena, and the Mausoleum of the Atilii in Sádaba, Zaragoza. Roman triumphal arches can be found in Cabanes, Castellón, Medinaceli, and the Arc de Berà near Roda de Berà. Pre-Romanesque The term Pre-Romanesque refers to the Christian art after the Classical Age and before Romanesque art and architecture. It cover very heterogeneous artistic displays for they were developed in different centuries and by different cultures. Spanish territory boasts a rich variety of Pre-Romanesque architecture: some of its branches, like the Asturian art reached high levels of refinement for their era and cultural context. =Visigothic architecture= =Asturian architecture= Interior of San Julián de los Prados The kingdom of Asturias arose in 718, when the Astur tribes, rallied in assembly, decided to appoint Pelayo as their leader. Pelayo joined the local tribes and the refuged Visigoths under his command, with the intention of progressively restoring Gothic Order. Asturian Pre-Romanesque is a singular feature in all Spain, which, while combining elements from other styles as Visigothic and local traditions, created and developed its own personality and characteristics, reaching a considerable level of refinement, not only as regards construction, but also in terms of aesthetics. Santa María del Naranco As regards its evolution, from its appearance, Asturian Pre-Romanesque followed a \\"stylistic sequence closely associated with the kingdom's political evolution, its stages clearly outlined\\". It was mainly a court architecture, and five stages are distinguished: a first period (737–791) from the reign of the king Fáfila to Vermudo I, a second stage comprises the reign of Alfonso II (791–842), entering a stage of stylistic definition. These two first stages receive the name of 'Pre-Ramirense'. The most important example is the church San Julián de los Prados in Oviedo, with an interesting volume system and a complex iconographic fresco program, related narrowly to the Roman mural paintings. Lattices and trifoliate windows in the apse appear for the first time at this stage. The Holy Chamber of the Cathedral of Oviedo, San Pedro de Nora and Santa María de Bendones also belong to it. The third period comprises the reigns of Ramiro I (842–850) and Ordoño I (850–866). It is called 'Ramirense' and is considered the zenith of the style, due to the work of an unknown architect who brought new structural and ornamental achievements like the barrel vault, and the consistent use of transverse arches and buttresses, which made the style rather close to the structural achievements of the Romanesque two centuries later. Some writers have pointed to an unexplained Syrian influence of the rich ornamentation. In that period, most of the masterpieces of the style flourished: the palace pavilions of Naranco Mountain (Santa Maria del Naranco and San Miguel de Lillo), and the church of Santa Cristina de Lena were built in that period. The fourth period belongs to the reign of Alfonso III (866–910), where a strong Mozarabic influence arrived to Asturian architecture, and the use of the horseshoe arch expanded. A fifth and last period, which coincides with the transfer of the court to León, the disappearance of the kingdom of Asturias, and simultaneously, of Asturian Pre- Romanesque. =Repopulation architecture= The Church of San Pedro in Lárrede Between the end of the 9th century and the beginning of the 11th century, a number of churches were built in the Northern Christian kingdoms. They are widely but incorrectly known as Mozarabic architecture. This architecture is a summary of elements of diverse extraction irregularly distributed, of a form that in occasions predominate those of paleo-Christian, Visigothic or Asturian origin, while at other times emphasizes the Muslim impression. The churches have usually basilica or centralized plans, sometimes with opposing apses. Principal chapels are of rectangular plan on the exterior and ultra- semicircular in the interior. The horseshoe arch of Muslim evocation is used, somewhat more closed and sloped than the Visigothic as well as the alfiz. Geminated and tripled windows of Asturian tradition and grouped columns forming composite pillars, with Corinthian capital decorated with stylized elements. Decoration has resemblance to the Visigothic based in volutes, swastikas, and vegetable and animal themes forming projected borders and sobriety of exterior decoration. Some innovations are introduced, as great lobed corbels that support very pronounced eaves. A great command of the technique in construction can be observed, employing ashlar, walls reinforced by exterior buttresses and covering by means of segmented vaults, including by the traditional barrel vaults. The architecture of Al-Andalus =The Caliphate of Córdoba= Hypostyle hall with Moorish columns in the Mosque- Cathedral of Córdoba The Muslim conquest of the former Hispania by the troops of Musa ibn Nusair and Tariq ibn Ziyad, and the overthrowing of the Umayyad dynasty in Damascus, led to the creation of an independent Emirate by Abd ar- Rahman I, the only surviving prince who escaped from Abbasids, and established his capital city in Córdoba. It was to become the cultural capital of Occident from 750 to 1009. The architecture built in Al-Andalus under the Umayyads evolved from the architecture of Damascus, with the addition of aesthetic achievements of local influence: the horseshoe arch, a symbol of Moorish architecture, was taken from Visigoths. Architects, artists and craftsmen came from the Orient to construct cities like Medina Azahara, whose splendour couldn't have been imagined by the European kingdoms of the era.Descriptions of Ibn Arabi, Ibn Bashkuwal, Al-Maqqari and contemporary chronists. The most outstanding construction of the Umayyad Córdoba is the Great Mosque, built in consecutive stages by Abd ar-Rahman I, Abd ar-Rahman II, Al-Hakam II and Al- Mansur. =The Taifas= Multifoil arches at the Aljafería Palace, Zaragoza The Caliphate disappeared and was split into several small kingdoms called taifas. Their political weakness was accompanied by a cultural retreat, and together with a quick advance of the Christian kingdoms, the taifas clung to the prestige of structures and forms of the style of Córdoba. The recession was felt in the construction techniques and in the materials, though not in the profusion of the ornamentation. The lobes of multifoil arches were multiplied and thinned, transformed in lambrequins, and all the Caliphal elements were exaggerated. Some magnificent examples of the taifa architecture have reached our times, like the Aljafería Palace in Zaragoza, or the small Mosque of Cristo de la Luz in Toledo, later transformed into one of the first examples of Mudéjar architecture. =Almoravids and Almohads= Almohad tower and Renaissance bell section merge into a harmonious whole in the Giralda, Seville The Almoravids invaded Al-Andalus from North Africa in 1086, and unified the taifas under their power. They developed their own architecture, but very little of it remains because of the next invasion, that of the Almohads, who imposed Islamic ultra-orthodoxy and destroyed almost every significant Almoravid building, together with Medina Azahara and other Caliphate constructions. Their art was extremely sober and bare, and they used brick as their main material. Virtually their only superficial decoration, the sebka, is based in a grid of rhombuses. The Almohads also used palm decoration, but this was nothing more than a simplification of the much more decorated Almoravid palm. As time passed, the art became slightly more decorative. The best known piece of Almohad architecture is the Giralda, the former minaret of the Mosque of Seville. Classified as Mudéjar, but immersed in the Almohad aesthetic, the synagogue of Santa María la Blanca, in Toledo, is a rare example of architectural collaboration between the three cultures of Medieval Spain. =Nasrid architecture of the Kingdom of Granada= The Alhambra: Court of the Lions After the dissolution of the Almohad empire, the scattered Moorish kingdoms of the south of the Peninsula were reorganized, and in 1237, the Nasrid kings established their capital city in Granada. The architecture they produced was to be one of the richest produced by Islam in any period. This owed a great deal to the cultural heritage of the former Moorish styles of Al-Andalus that the Nasrids eclectically combined, and to the close contact with the northern Christian Kingdoms. The palaces of Alhambra and Generalife are the most outstanding constructions of the period. The structural and ornamental elements were taken from Cordobese architecture (horseshoe arches), from Almohads (sebka and palm decoration), but also created by them, like the prism and cylindrical capitals and mocárabe arches, in a combination of interior and exterior spaces, of gardening and architecture, that aimed to please all the senses. Unlike the Umayyad architecture, which made use of expensive and imported materials, the Nasrids used only humble materials: clay, plaster and wood. However, the aesthetic outcome is full of complexity and is mystifying for the beholder: The multiplicity of decoration, the skillful use of light and shadow and the incorporation of water into the architecture are some of the keys features of the style.Chueca Goitia, Fernando: Invariantes castizos de la Arquitectura Española. Manifiesto de la Alhambra Epigraphy was also used on the walls of the different rooms, with allusive poems to the beauty of the spaces.Garcia Gomez, Emilio: Poemas árabes en los muros y fuentes de la Alhambra / 8460041344 Instituto Egipcio de Estudios Islámicos en Madrid Romanesque South facade of Jaca Cathedral Romanesque architecture first developed in Spain in the 10th and 11th centuries, before Cluny's influence, in Lérida, Barcelona, Tarragona and Huesca, and in the Pyrenees, simultaneously with the north of Italy, as what is called First Romanesque or Lombard Romanesque. It is a very primitive style, whose characteristics are thick walls, lack of sculpture and the presence of rhythmic ornamental arches, typified by the churches in the Valle de Bohí. The full Romanesque architecture arrived with the influence of Cluny through the Way of Saint James, that ends in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. The model of the Spanish Romanesque in the 12th century was the Cathedral of Jaca, with its characteristic plan and apse, and its \\"chessboard\\" decoration in stripes, called taqueado jaqués. As the Christian Kingdoms advanced southwards, this model spread throughout the reconquered areas with some variations. Spanish Romanesque also shows the influence of Spanish pre-Romanesque styles, mainly Asturian and Mozarabic, but there is also a strong Moorish influence, especially the vaults of Córdoba's Mosque, and the multifoil arches. In the 13th century, some churches alternated in style between Romanesque and Gothic. Aragón, Navarra and Castile-Leon are some of the best areas for Spanish Romanesque architecture. Gothic Burgos Cathedral The Gothic style arrived in Spain as Christianity grew in strength in the 12th century. In this time, late Romanesque alternated with a few expressions of pure Gothic architecture like the Cathedral of Ávila. The High Gothic arrived in all its strength through the Way of St. James in the 13th century, with some of the purest Gothic cathedrals, with French and German influences: the cathedrals of Burgos, León and Toledo. The most important post-13th century Gothic styles in Spain are the Levantine and Isabelline Gothic. Levantine Gothic is characterised by its structural achievements and their unification of space, with masterpieces as La Seu in Palma de Mallorca; the Valencian Gothic style of the Lonja de Valencia (Valencia's silk market), and Santa Maria del Mar (Barcelona). Isabelline Gothic, created during the times of the Catholic Monarchs, was part of the transition to Renaissance architecture, but also a strong resistance to Italian Renaissance style. Highlights of the style include the Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes in Toledo and the Royal Chapel of Granada. Mudéjar The Mudéjar style is Moorish influenced Christian architecture that emerged in the Christian kingdoms of the north in the 12th century and spread with the Christian Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula. The reconquest brought Moorish and Moorish influenced Christian craftsmen under Christian rule who then influenced architecture in the expanding Christian kingdoms. It is not a style of architecture; Mudéjar style refers to the application of Moorish decorations or materials to whatever Christian architecture existed at the time, producing Mudéjar-Romanesque, Mudéjar-Gothic and Mudéjar-Renaissance. La Seo of Zaragoza Mudéjar is characterised by the use of brick as the main building material. Mudéjar did not involve the creation of new structures (unlike Gothic or Romanesque), but reinterpreting Christian styles through Islamic and Jewish influences. The dominant geometrical character, distinctly Islamic, emerged conspicuously in the accessory crafts using cheap materials elaborately worked – tilework, brickwork, wood carving, plaster carving, and ornamental metals. Even after the Muslims were no longer employed, many of their methods and decorative styles continued to be applied to Spanish architecture. It is accepted that the Mudéjar style was born in Sahagún. Mudéjar extended to the rest of the Kingdom of León, Toledo, Ávila, Segovia, and later to Andalusia, especially Seville and Granada. The Mudéjar Rooms of the Alcázar of Seville, although classified as Mudéjar, are more closely related to the Nasrid Alhambra than to other buildings of the style as they were created by Pedro of Castile, who brought architects from Granada who experienced very little Christian influence. Centers of Mudéjar art are found in other cities, like Toro, Cuéllar, Arévalo and Madrigal de las Altas Torres. It became highly developed in Aragon, with three main focuses: Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Teruel, during the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. In Teruel a wide group of imposing churches and towers were built. Other fine examples of Mudéjar can be found in Casa de Pilatos in Seville, Santa Clara Monastery in Tordesillas, or the churches of Toledo, one of the oldest and most outstanding Mudéjar centers. In Toledo, the synagogues of Santa María la Blanca and El Tránsito (both Mudéjar though not Christian) deserve special mention.López Guzmán, Rafael. Arquitectura mudéjar. Manuales Arte Cátedra. Renaissance Trujillo In Spain, Renaissance styles began to be grafted onto Gothic forms in the last decades of the 15th century. The forms that started to spread were made mainly by local architects: that is the cause of the creation of a specifically Spanish Renaissance that brought the influence of southern Italian architecture, sometimes from illuminated books and paintings, mixed with the gothic tradition and local idiosyncrasies. The new style was called Plateresque because of the extremely decorated façades that brought to the mind the decorative motifs of the intricately detailed work of silversmiths, the \\"plateros\\". Classical orders and candelabra motifs (a candelieri) were combined freely into symmetrical wholes. In that scenery, the Palace of Charles V by Pedro Machuca in Granada was an unexpected achievement in the most advanced Renaissance of the moment. The palace can be defined as an anticipation of the Mannerism, due to its command of classical language and its breakthrough aesthetic achievements. It was constructed before the main works of Michelangelo and Palladio. Its influence was very limited and poorly understood, the Plateresque forms prevailed in the general panorama. El Escorial As decades passed, the Gothic influence disappeared and the research of an orthodox classicism reached high levels. Although Plateresque is a commonly used term to define most of the architectural production of the late 15th and first half of 16th century, some architects acquired a more sober personal style, like Diego Siloe and Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón. Examples include the façades of the University of Salamanca and of the Convent of San Marcos in León. The highlight of Spanish Renaissance is represented by the Royal Monastery of El Escorial, built by Juan Bautista de Toledo and Juan de Herrera, where a much closer adherence to the art of ancient Rome was overpassed by an extremely sober style. The influence from Flanders roofs, the symbolism of the scarce decoration and the precise cut of the granite established the basis for a new style, the Herrerian. A disciple of Herrera, Juan Bautista Villalpando was influential for interpreting the recently revived text of Vitruvius to suggest the origin of the classical orders in Solomon's Temple.Alberto Pérez-Gómez. Juan Bautista Villalpando's Divine Model in Architectural Theory. In Alberto Pérez-Gómez, Stephen Parcell. Chora 3: Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture. McGill-Queen's Press. 1999. Baroque North facade of the Royal Palace and view of the Sabatini Gardens, Madrid, Spain As Italian Baroque influences grew, they gradually superseded in popularity the restrained classicizing approach of Juan de Herrera, which had been in vogue since the late sixteenth century. As early as 1667, the façades of Granada Cathedral (by Alonso Cano) and Jaén Cathedral (by Eufrasio López de Rojas) suggest the artists' fluency in interpreting traditional motifs of Spanish cathedral architecture in the Baroque aesthetic idiom. Vernacular Baroque with its roots still in the Herrerian style and in traditional brick construction was developed in Madrid throughout the 17th century. Examples include Plaza Mayor and the Major House. Obradoiro façade of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela In contrast to the art of Northern Europe, the Spanish art of the period appealed to the emotions rather than seeking to please the intellect. The Churriguera family, which specialized in designing altars and retables, revolted against the sobriety of the Herrerian classicism and promoted an intricate, exaggerated, almost capricious style of surface decoration known as the Churrigueresque. Within half a century, they transformed Salamanca into an exemplary Churrigueresque city. The evolution of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized Guarini's blend of Solomonic columns and Composite order, known as the \\"supreme order\\". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or estipite, in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation toward a neoclassical balance and sobriety. Dome of the chapel of the Palace of Infante don Luis in Boadilla del Monte (Community of Madrid, Spain) Two of the most eye-catching creations of Spanish Baroque are the energetic façades of the University of Valladolid (Diego Tomé, 1719) and Hospicio de San Fernando in Madrid (Pedro de Ribera, 1722), whose curvilinear extravagance seems to herald Antonio Gaudí and Art Nouveau. In this case as in many others, the design involves a play of tectonic and decorative elements with little relation to structure and function. However, Churrigueresque Baroque offered some of the most impressive combinations of space and light with buildings like Granada Charterhouse, considered to be the apotheosis of Churrigueresque style applied to interior spaces, or El Transparente of the Cathedral of Toledo by Narciso Tomé, where sculpture and architecture are integrated to achieve notable light dramatic effects. The Royal Palace of Madrid and the interventions of Paseo del Prado (Salón del Prado and Alcalá Doorgate) in the same city, deserve special mention. They were constructed in a sober Baroque international style, often mistaken for neoclassical, by the Bourbon kings Philip V and Charles III. The Royal Palaces of La Granja de San Ildefonso, in Segovia, and Aranjuez, in Madrid, are good examples of Baroque integration of architecture and gardening, with noticeable French influence (La Granja is known as the Spanish Versailles), but with local spatial conceptions which in some ways display the heritage of the Moorish occupation. Rococo was first introduced to Spain in the (Cathedral of Murcia, west façade, 1733). The greatest practitioner of the Spanish Rococo style was a native master, Ventura Rodríguez, responsible for the dazzling interior of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza (1750). Rococo Neoclassical Prado Museum in Madrid, by Juan de Villanueva The extremely intellectual postulates of Neoclassicism succeeded in Spain less than the much more expressive of Baroque. Spanish Neoclassicism was spread by the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, founded in 1752. The main figure was Juan de Villanueva, who adapted Edmund Burke's achievements about the sublime and the beauty to the requirements of Spanish clime and history. He built the Prado Museum that combined three programs - an academy, an auditorium and a museum - in one building with three separated entrances. This was part of the ambitious program of Charles III, who intended to make Madrid the Capital of Art and Science. Very close to the museum, Villanueva built the Royal Observatory of Madrid. He also designed several summer houses for the kings in El Escorial and Aranjuez and reconstructed the Plaza Mayor of Madrid, among other important works. Villanuevas´ pupils Antonio López Aguado and Isidro González Velázquez expanded the Neoclassical style in Spain. Spanish Colonial architecture Santa Prisca Church in Taxco, Mexico, is an example of New Spanish Churrigueresque The combination of the Native American and Moorish decorative influences with an extremely expressive interpretation of the Churrigueresque idiom may account for the full-bodied and varied character of the Baroque in the American colonies of Spain. Even more than its Spanish counterpart, American Baroque developed as a style of stucco decoration. Twin- towered façades of many American cathedrals of the seventeenth century had medieval roots and the full-fledged Baroque did not appear until 1664, when the Jesuit shrine on Plaza des Armas in Cusco was built. The Andean Baroque was particularly lush, as evidenced by the monastery of San Francisco in Lima (1673), which has a dark intricate façade sandwiched between the twin towers of local yellow stone. While the rural Baroque of the Jesuite missions (estancias) in Córdoba, Argentina, followed the model of Il Gesù, provincial \\"mestizo\\" (crossbred) styles emerged in Arequipa, Potosí and La Paz. In the eighteenth century, the architects of the region turned for inspiration to the Mudéjar art of medieval Spain. The late Baroque type of Peruvian façade first appears in the Church of Our Lady of La Merced, Lima (1697–1704). Similarly, the Church of La Compañia, Quito (1722–65) suggests a carved altarpiece with its richly sculpted façade and a surfeit of the Solomonic column. The Paoay Church in Paoay, Philippines, is an example of Earthquake Baroque architecture. To the north, the richest province of 18th-century New Spain – Mexico – produced some fantastically extravagant and visually frenetic architecture known as New Spanish Churrigueresque. This ultra-Baroque approach culminates in the works of Lorenzo Rodríguez, whose masterpiece is the Sagrario Metropolitano in Mexico City (1749–69). Other fine examples of the style may be found in the remote silver-mining towns. For instance, the Sanctuary at Ocotlán (begun in 1745) is a top-notch Baroque cathedral surfaced in bright red tiles, which contrast delightfully with a plethora of compressed ornament lavishly applied to the main entrance and the slender flanking towers. The true capital of New Spanish Baroque is Puebla, Mexico, where a ready supply of hand-painted glazed tiles (talavera) and vernacular gray stone led to its evolving further into a personalised and highly localised art form with a pronounced Indian taste. Spanish colonial Chinese influence exclusive to Spanish East Indies was born when Spain colonized what is now the Philippines, in South East Asia. Pre-Spanish Philippine architecture was based on the native nipa hut, which corresponds to the tropical climate, stormy seasons, and earthquake prone environment of the archipelago. This native architecture was combined with the influences of the Spanish colonizers and Chinese traders to form a hybrid Austronesian, Chinese and Spanish architecture. 19th century =Eclecticism and Regionalism= Palace of Communications in Madrid During the second half of the 19th century, the Revivalism dominated the scene in Europe, and so happened in Spain. Architects focused in choosing which was the most appropriated historical style for each use or occasion. Neoclassicism opened the gates to Neo-Byzantine, Neo-Gothic, Neo-Renaissance, Neo–Baroque, Egyptian Revival, Neo-Mudéjar, and so on. This led to a particular new style made of the mixture of several old styles in the same construction: the Eclecticism. It is difficult to trace a clear line to separate styles as Modernisme, Industrial iron architecture and Eclecticism, as very often architects took some features of several of them for their works. This is the case of Antonio Palacios, co-designer with Joaquín Otamendi of the Palace of Communications of Madrid, inaugurated in 1909. Other works of Palacios include the Círculo de Bellas Artes, the Río de la Plata Bank, the Hospital of Maudes, all of them in Madrid. In the first half of the 20th century, another wave of revivals emerged, mainly after the Iberoamerican Exhibition of Seville in 1929: the Regionalism. Features of the different regional vernacular architectures took then the protagonism. Interior of Iglesia de San Pedro, Teruel, Aragón. The 14th century mudéjar-gothic church was declared World Heritage in 1986. Neo-Mudejar decoration was added in 1896–1902. =Neo-Mudéjar= In the late 19th century a new architectural movement emerged in Madrid as a revival of the Mudéjar architecture. The Neo- Mudéjar soon spread to other regions of the country. Architects such as Emilio Rodríguez Ayuso perceived the Mudéjar as a characteristic and exclusive Spanish style. They started to construct buildings using some of the features of the ancient style, as horseshoe arches and the use of the abstract shaped brick ornamentations for the façades. It became a popular style for bull rings and for other public constructions, but also for housing, due to its cheap materials, mainly brick for exteriors. The Neo-Mudéjar was often combined with Neo-Gothic features. =Architecture of glass and iron= During the Industrial Revolution, the new use of iron and glass as the main materials for building construction was, as in the rest of Europe, applied specially in train stations, winterhouses, industrial buildings and pavilions for exhibitions. The architects who most developed this style in Spain were Ricardo Velázquez Bosco and Alberto del Palacio, although glass for façades and iron for structures were used to some extent by other architects, such as Antonio Palacios, Enrique María Repullés y Vargas or Narciso Pascual y Colomer. A notable example is the Palacio de Cristal del Retiro in Madrid. 20th century Basilica Sagrada Família in Barcelona =Catalan Modernisme= When the city of Barcelona was allowed to expand beyond its historic limits in the late 19th century, the resulting Eixample district by Ildefons Cerdà became the site of a burst of architectural energy known as the Modernisme movement. Modernisme broke with past styles and used organic forms for its inspiration in the same way as the concurrent Art Nouveau and Jugendstil movements in the rest of Europe. Most famous among the architects represented there is Antoni Gaudí, whose works in Barcelona and spread in other parts of Catalonia, León and Cantabria, mixing traditional architectural styles with the new, were a precursor to modern architecture. Perhaps the most famous example of his work is the still-unfinished Sagrada Família basilica, the largest building in the Eixample. Other notable Catalan architects of that period include Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, although their approach to Modernisme was largely more linked to Neo-Gothic shapes. =Contemporary architecture= The creation in 1928 of the GATCPAC group in Barcelona, followed by the foundation of GATEPAC (1930) by architects mainly from Zaragoza, Madrid, San Sebastián and Bilbao, established two groups of young architects practicing Modern architecture in Spain. Josep Lluis Sert, Fernando García Mercadal, Jose María de Aizpurúa and Joaquín Labayen among others were organised in three regional groups. Other architects explored the Modern style with their personal views: Casto Fernández Shaw with his visionary work, most of it on paper, Josep Antoni Coderch, with his integration of the Mediterranean housing and the new style concepts or Luis Gutiérrez Soto, mostly influenced by the Expressionist tendencies. The Barcelona Pavilion designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, 1929 At the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, the German pavilion designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became an instant icon, amalgamating Rohe's minimalism and notions of truth to materials with a De Stijl influenced treatment of planes in space. The large overhanging roof famously 'hovers' apparently unsupported. During and after the Spanish Civil War and World War II, Spain found herself both politically and economically isolated. The consequent effect of which, in tandem with Franco's preference for \\"a deadening, nationalistic sort of classical kitsch\\", was to largely suppress progressive modern architecture in Spain. Nevertheless, some architects were able to reconcile advances in construction with official approval, notably in the prolific output of Gutiérrez Soto whose interest in topology and rational distribution of space effectively alternated historical revivals and rationalist imagery with ease. Luis Moya Blanco's achievements in the construction with brick vaults deserve also a mention. His interest in traditional brick construction led him to a deep investigation into the modern formal possibilities of that material. In the last decades of the Franco's life, a new generation of architects rescued the legacy of the GATEPAC with strength: Alejandro de la Sota was the pioneer in that new way, and young architects as Francisco Javier Sáenz de Oiza, Fernando Higueras and Miguel Fisac, often with modest budgets, investigated in prefabrication and collective housing typos. The Auditorio de Tenerife, by Santiago Calatrava, 2003 The death of Franco and the return of democracy brought a new architectural optimism to Spain in the late 1970s and 1980s. Critical regionalism became the dominant school of thought for serious architecture.Zabalbeascoa The influx of money from EU funding, tourism and a flowering economy strengthened and stabilised Spain's economic base, providing fertile conditions for Spanish architecture. A new generation of architects emerged, amongst whom were Enric Miralles, Carme Pinós, and the architect/engineer Santiago Calatrava. The 1992 Barcelona Olympics and the World's Fair in Seville, further bolstered Spain's reputation on the international stage, to the extent that many architects from countries suffering from recessions, moved to Spain to assist in the boom. In recognition of Barcelona's patronage of architecture, the Royal Institute of British Architects awarded the Royal Gold Medal to Barcelona in 1999, the first time in its history the award was made to a city.list of medal winners (PDF) Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, 1997 Bilbao attracted the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation to construct a new art museum, which opened in 1997. Designed by Frank Gehry in a deconstructivist manner, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao became world-famous and single-handedly raised the profile of Bilbao on the world stage. Such was the success of the museum that the construction of iconic architecture in towns aspiring to raise their international profile has become a recognised town planning strategy known as the \\"Bilbao effect\\".Bacharach, Jacob (2002) The Bilbao Effect In 2003, the Prince of Asturias, Felipe de Borbón opened in the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Canary Islands), the modern building of the Auditorio de Tenerife, designed by Santiago Calatrava between 1997-2003. For this event was attended by various correspondents and newspapers around the world. =Famous Spanish architects of the 20th century=Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926) *Lluis Domenech i Montaner (1850–1923) *Secundino Zuazo (1887–1971) *Antonio Palacios (1874–1945) * (1896–1978) *Josep Lluis Sert (1902–1983) *Josep Antoni Coderch (1913–1984) *Luis Gutiérrez Soto (1890–1977) *Alejandro de la Sota (1913–1996) *Miguel Fisac (1913–2006) *Francisco Javier Sáenz de Oiza (1918–2000) * (1920–1996) *Fernando Higueras (1929–2008) *Rafael Moneo (1937), Pritzker Prize in 1996 *Ricardo Bofill (1939) *Mariano Bayón (1942) *Alberto Campo Baeza (1946) *Santiago Calatrava (1951) *Adolfo Moran (1953) *Enric Miralles (1955–2000) *Mansilla+Tuñón *Alejandro Zaera (1963) * Carme Pigem, Ramón Vilalta and Rafael Aranda; Pritzker Prize in 2017 21st century In 2006, the exhibition \\"On-Site: New architecture in Spain\\" was held in the MoMA. It defined Spain as a country that has lately become known as an international center for design innovation and excellence, as shown in the fact that seven Pritzker awarded architects were selected for the exhibition. As Terence Riley, then in charge of the Architectural Department of the MoMA, said: \\"There is not a 'Spanish' architectural style. But there is an increasing level of quality and beauty within the new projects, probably more than in any other part of the world\\". The curator also stated that in Spain there is a lot of construction while there is even more in China. \\"However, while in China you can find hardly any interesting proposal, there are a lot in Spain. Their variety and open-minded lines are surprising.\\" Marqués de Riscal Hotel in Elciego, 2006 In 2006, Terminal 4 of Barajas Airport by Richard Rogers and Antonio Lamela won the British Stirling Prize. In Barcelona, the Torre Glòries by French architect Jean Nouvel combines different architectural concepts, resulting in a striking structure built with reinforced concrete, covered with a façade of glass, with its window openings cut out of the structural concrete. The Marqués de Riscal Hotel in Elciego, designed by Frank Gehry using methods previously employed in the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, is completed. Between 2006 and 2009, four skyscrapers were built in Madrid, of which the tallest is 250 meters. This business park is called Cuatro Torres Business Area, and the Torre de Cristal, which is the tallest in all of Spain, is designed by César Pelli. From 2008, Spain experienced the late-2000s recession in a particularly severe way and especially in construction, which suffered a sharp drop. Many of the public and private architectural developments were cancelled or indefinitely delayed. In 2011 the Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre was inaugurated in Avilés, Asturias. This is the only work of the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer in Spain. It has five elements: an open square, a dome, a tower, an auditorium and a multi- purpose building. Vernacular architecture Due to the climatic and topographic differences throughout Spain, the vernacular architecture shows a plentiful variety. Limestone, slate, granite, clay (cooked or not), wood, and grass are used in the different regions. Structure and distribution differ depending on regional customs. Some constructions are houses (like alqueria, carmen, casa montañesa, caserío, cortijo, palloza, pazo, as well as the pictured ones: File:Horreo-Gonzar-Galicia-2010.jpgThe hórreo is an elevated granary from Galicia and Asturias.

The parish boundary is formed by the River Axe. History There is evidence, from flint finds, of occupation of a site, known as Westbury Sleight during the Mesolithic period, which fieldwork during 2007 suggested was a platform cairn with field banks of Bronze Age date. In 1969 traces of an infilled cave were discovered in a limestone quarry which produced numerous bones from extinct animals and flakes of flint and chert. Westbury-sub-Mendip was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Westberie, meaning 'The west hill under the Mendip Hills' from the Old English west and beorg. It was the property of Gisa, Bishop of Wells. However given the etymology quoted by EkwallEkwall, Eilert (1966). A Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names. Oxford University Press a more likely meaning is 'fortified enclosure west (of Wells)'. The 'fortification' may have been the Iron Age fort above the neighbouring village of Rodney Stoke; or the sub-circular enclosure around a British church or monastery; or around the lord of the manor's hall, now Court House Farm. The parish was part of the hundred of Wells Forum. The village cross is a high shaft on a six step octagonal base. The village once had a railway station on the Cheddar Valley line, also known as the Strawberry Line. The station, known as Lodge Hill, apparently to avoid confusion with Westbury in Wiltshire, is now an industrial estate providing employment for the village. Until recently the former railway line was an airfield for light aircraft. The village has a number of amenities including a primary school, parish church, post office and pub. Social events include the annual Club Day on Spring Bank Holiday Monday. This involves a parade through the village led by a brass band. The event is organised by The Westbury Friendly Society, which is one of the five surviving Friendly Societies in Somerset. The church of St Lawrence at Westbury was given to the Augustinian canons of Bruton Priory by Robert, Bishop of Bath, in the 12th century. It is a Grade II* listed building. Westbury-sub-Mendip won the title of Somerset Village of the Year 2006. During 2009 a K6 Red telephone box in the village was converted into a library or book exchange replacing the services of the mobile library which no longer visits the village. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wells Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Religious sites The Church of St Lawrence was built in the 12th century. It is a Grade II* listed building.

It currently plays in Serie D.  History  =The Origins= In 1907 the Society Giovane Sport was established in Lavagna which absorbed the Committee for the celebrations of the XX Settembre (originated after 1870 in memory of the taking of Porta Pia) with prevailing activities aimed at athletics, heavy and cycling. Shortly thereafter the Youth Club arose, between the two associations there was no good blood for parochial reasons, But in 1919 the reflexes of the war ended victoriously contributed to arouse a mutual desire to join together in order to strengthen the city sport. In 1914 and 1915, for example, some friendly matches were played against the Ruentes Rapallo and against the Ardita Juventus, First by Giovane Sport and then by an elusive Pro Lavagna born probably from the first experiments in the town union. In 1919 more and more frequent the friendly competitions disputed by the Circolo Giovanile Lavagna: on April 27 against the 90th Chiavari Infantry, on May 4 against the Sports Star of Zoagli (2-0), on May 18 against the Ruentes Rapallo (1-2) and May 25 against Entella Chiavari (2-5). At first the date of birth of the Unione Sportiva Lavagnese seemed to be 15 July 1918, But from human testimony and in the absence of a true previous official document the date was fixed on 19 June 1919. =Regional Serie C= Unione Sportiva Dilettanti Lavagnese was founded in 1919, but it was only in 1948 that reached the first milestone: third place in Serie C North Group B . According to the Regulation, the first team in each group, then became two after this season, he was entitled to entry into the new Serie C, managed by the National League: coming third, failed to reach a spot in the new league. From that moment began a dark period for Lavagnese, which was playing in minor categories such as Promozione and Prima Categoria. = Serie D = In 1999 Lavagnese played in the First Category championship, from 2002-2003 he took part in the D Series amateur championship, and the following years he was ranked 12th, 3rd, 6th, 13th and 8th. In the 2007-2008 season the Lavagnese played an excellent championship finishing in 4th place which guaranteed the qualification to the playoffs to arrive in Serie C2. The play-offs were not favorable to the Juventus team that lost the semi-final to Pro Belvedere Vercelli 1-0, thus ending its season. The 2008-2009 season opened well for the Ligurians who, after 6 days, found themselves third in the league on equal points with Derthona (2nd) and only one point from the Biella area (1st), but turned out to be a flash in the pan as the Lavagnese failed to maintain this rhythm and had to settle for a salvation with the 10th place finish. In the 2011-2012 season he qualified as 5th in the regular season, participating in the group play-offs and winning them thanks to a 0-1 on the field of Chieri and a 0-4 on that of Santhià, accessing the national phase for the first time in its history. The adventure in the playoffs ended in the fourth round with the historic 1-0 defeat against Cosenza Calcio. In the following two seasons he arrived at the second stage of the playoffs while in 2014-2015 he was ranked ninth in Serie D with the Gabriele Venuti flag which at the end of the season retired from football played at the age of 37 years after 20 years of activity of which 11 to the Lavagnese. In October of the same year he announced the withdrawal of another great local football player: Paolo Livellara, a 1980 class defender with 5 seasons and 133 presences behind him and 9 goals with the Bianconeri jersey and who will be training the Bianconeri debutants. The 2015-2016 season was certainly the best in Serie D for the Lavagnese which reached the absolute third place behind Sporting Bellinzago and Caronnese losing the final play-off against the latter. Despite the fact that Lavagnese was the first of the non-eligible players and many of them did not accept the repechage, the Compagnoni team confirmed the category and competed in the 15th consecutive Serie D championship. In the summer of 2016, after seven seasons at Juventus and the conquest of the qualification for four editions of the national playoffs, the streets of Mr. Andrea Dagnino and della Lavagnese split. The new technician for the 2016-2017 season was thus identified in Luca Tabbiani, ex-child prodigy of Genoa with a great experience as a footballer among the professionals with Genoa, Mestre, Trento, Cremonese, Bari, Triestina, Pisa, Lecco and Sestri Levante who will have the task of starting from scratch. The first goal of the season was the quiet salvation but with the passage of time and the amalgamation of the team the Juventus team will succeed in the enterprise of reaching equally the Play-Offs despite the general downsizing. Following the excellent work of Mr. Tabbiani and his staff, some important companies are interested in the former Genoa coach, so the company believes the time has come to entrust the bench to the former Captain and warrior of many battles Gabriele Venuti who in the last two seasons he first qualified for the group play-offs with the National Juniores and then assisted Andrea Dagnino as technical collaborator and Luca Tabbiani as second coach; his collaborator is Paolo Livellara (who arrived in the final with the Allievi Regionali leva 2000) who will also train the Juniors with the vice captain of the first team Giacomo Avellino. In September the team is reinforced with the arrival of the released Silvano Raggio Garibaldi (Stefano's twin brother, former goalkeeper of the Bianconeri) and Simone Basso (formerly at Lavagnese in 2005-2006). However, the 2017-2018 season will be one of the worst since the company disputed the Serie D; after a good start the Venuti team will meet again in November at the top of the standings, after a few direct clashes lost at the halfway point, Lavagnese is stationed in seventh place with 27 points in 17 races, but the second round will turn into a nightmare with good performances but disappointing results, in the end only 17 points in 17 races. In the last four days to give a signal, the company exempts Gabriele Venuti and promotes Gianni Nucera from deputy to technical manager. Accomplice to physical and mental fatigue the pro tempore mister fails to do better and the championship ends between the general bitterness at the 13th place. 11 May 2018 is announced as a new coach in the year of the company's Centenary Luca Tabbiani, welcome return after the parenthesis with Savona. This year, Lavagnese has its 17th consecutive season in Serie D and is in 10th place. On 4 June 2019, Gianni Nucera is recalled. =Play Fields= From 1919: the first playing field of the Unione Sportiva Lavagna was the esplanade in front of the railway station, the current Piazza Torino. From November 29, 1923: Piazza Vittorio Veneto, it was from this date that the municipality granted US Lavagnese the use, not only for football matches, but also for those of tambourine, javelin throwing, discus throwing and for the performances of the Lavagnese city choir. The '20s and' 30s: the US Lavagnese disputed friendly meetings and some local tournaments often asking for hospitality at the nearby Chiavari on the land of Corso Dante (between 1921 and 1933). On October 25, 1936, an agreement was signed between the Municipality of Lavagna and a citizen benefactor who had made a fortune in Venezuela, Commendatore Edoardo Riboli for the construction of the Littorio Sports Center. From 1 November 1939: the Lavagnese football formations performed on the Littorio Sports Field, later named after Edoardo Riboli. The official ceremony at which all the city authorities intervened together with benefactor commendator Edoardo Riboli, was followed by the opening match played between Genoa 1893 A and Genoa 1893 B and ended with a score of 10-1. In the 1945-46 sporting season the US Lavagnese played the First Division Championship on the ground of the Municipal of Chiavari, the Riboli was in fact unusable due to the occupation suffered during the war by the Allied soldiers who used it as a rest area for their tanks. In 1969 the stadium was equipped with a lighting system (the first in the Tigullio area), the pedestrian crossings were paved and all the structures painted. Since 2002, the year of the promotion in Serie D, the Riboli mantle is in synthetic. =The Super Ball Vis= The whole Lavagnese football paradox was the one that occurred in 1934 when in a Blackboard devoid of calcium and a regular field, a company, the Super Ball Vis, established itself nationally and internationally, which would supply the new official balls for Serie A, Vittorio Pozzo's national team, the International Cup and the European Club Cup; and for many more years for numerous sporting events, such as the 1952 Olympic Games in Finland and the 1960 in Rome. The \\"Condor\\" balloon had a circumference of 68 cm and a weight between 400 and 440 grams. The Super Ball Vis, a company based in Lavagna, which during the war also produced military shoes, offered the Condor for the Sunday challenges of the Lavagnese at the Riboli when the competitive activity resumed. It is even said that the new balls were used as a bargaining chip in market negotiations with other companies: Entella asked for 7 in 1946 to pass the Consonni player to the Bianconeri cousins. Starting in the 1970s, the simultaneous appearance on the market of multinationals in the sector (primarily Adidas) forced an adaptation of the company's structures with the transition to a new corporate structure, the transfer of the headquarters to San Salvatore di Cogorno and in time more recent the sale of the brand, still existing, to a specialized company.  Colors and badge  The social colors of the Unione Sportiva Lavagnese are white and black. The classic uniform has always been composed of a more or less wide black and white vertical striped shirt, combined with black socks with white stripes and black shorts. The only exception is the white celestial shirt of ACLavagna from 1990. The second jersey has varied over the years and was pink in 1935, pink with a black and white vertical band in 1963, blue with a white oblique band in 1973, yellow in 1990, orange in 2000, black in 2015 and red from 2018.

This small (up to about ) native of East Asia is a denizen of rice paddies, marshes, ponds, slow-moving streams and tide pools. It is euryhaline, occurring in both brackish and freshwater. It became popular as an aquarium fish because of its hardiness and pleasant coloration: its coloration varies from creamy-white to yellowish in the wild to white, creamy-yellow, or orange in aquarium-bred individuals. Bright yellow, red or green transgenic populations, similar to GloFish, have also been developed, but are banned from sale in the EU. The medaka has been a popular pet since the 17th century in Japan. After fertilization, the female carries her eggs attached anterior to the anal fin for a period before depositing them on plants or similar things.  Ecology  Medaka live in small ponds, shallow rivers, and rice fields. They can survive in a wide range of water temperatures (), but they prefer a water temperature of . Since they eat juvenile mosquitoes and small plankton, they are known as a beneficial organism for humans. They produce 10-20 eggs per birth, and they can produce eggs every day in laboratory conditions. They are seasonal breeding animals and usually lay eggs between spring and summer. They prefer to lay eggs around water grass and often prefer living in rice fields. The egg usually requires 4–10 days to hatch. They have an advanced renal function, which enables them to live in saltwater and brackish water. The average life span of this species in the wild is estimated to be 2 years, though in laboratory conditions they can survive 3–5 years. They live in schools, and they can recognize the faces of other individual medaka. Taxonomy and range Katori, Japan) As originally defined, O. latipes was native to much of east and mainland southeast Asia, but in recent decades most of these populations have been split off as separate species based on morphological (morphometrics and meristics) and genetic evidence. This limits the native range of definite O. latipes to Japan: eastern and southern Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and smaller southern islands in the country. Formerly included in this species but now regarded as separate are O. sakaizumii in northwestern Honshu in Japan (locally, it hybridizes with O. latipes), and O. sinensis (Chinese rice fish) in much of China, west Korea and parts of mainland southeast Asia. The taxonomic position of certain populations, including some in China, Laos and east Korea, is unclear and require further study. It is possible that all these Chinese populations are part of O. sinensis, but the Laos specimens are relatively large, similar to O. latipes rather than the tiny O. sinensis. The east Korean population is part of a clade with O. sakaizumii and O. latipes. Based on morphology it is closer to O. sakaizumii than O. latipes, but it may be an undescribed species. O. latipes has been introduced to Hokkaido in northern Japan (where ricefish are not native). There are other reports of introductions around the world, but at least most of those in mainland Asia and Europe involve O. sinensis (Chinese rice fish). = Origin of Southern and Northern Japanese Populations = Phylogenetic analysis shows that the southern Japanese population was derived from that of the northern Kyushu area and spread into Honshu. On the other hand, the northern population was derived from a population from the Tajima- Tango region and spread alongside the Sea of Japan coast. O. latipes is known to have nine sub-populations: East Japanese type, East Setouchi type, West Setouchi type, San'in type, Northern Kyushu type, Osumi Type, Ariake type, Satsuma type and Ryukyu type. These sub-populations have been mixed with each other due to artificial releasing and decreasing local genetic diversity. Use in science An orange aquarium variant (himedaka) achieved through selective breeding, photographed from above. Not to be confused with the brightly-colored transgenic aquarium variants Oryzias latipes is a model organism and is extensively used in many areas of biological research, most notably in toxicology. Medaka have a short gestation period, and are reproductively prolific — characteristics that make them easy to rear in the laboratory. They can withstand cold and can be shipped easily. Nearly all aspects of the life cycle of medaka have been analyzed by researchers including sexual behavior, genetic inheritance of coloration, spawning habits, feeding, pathology, embryological development, ecology, etc. It has a relatively small genome (~800 mega base pairs, half the size of the genome of another popular model fish, the zebrafish) as well as a generation time of 7 weeks (rather than 9 weeks for zebrafish) and hardier growth in a broad temperature range (). Transgenic medaka are relatively easy to produce. They have been genetically modified to secrete various human hormones, express promoter sequences from other fish, and to make antimicrobial proteins and a protein that makes the medaka glow fluorescent green, yellow or red. There are also many mutations that show up in medaka at random, for example, a mutant strain that lacks scales, and one with extra-long fins. Haploid embryonic stem cell lines have been established.Yi, M., et al. Generation of medaka fish haploid embryonic stem cells. Science 326(5951), 430-33, 16 October 2009. =In space= O. latipes mating in space O. latipes carries the distinction of having been the first vertebrate to mate in orbit. The result of the mating was a brood of healthy fry, hatched on the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1994. O. latipes returned to space in 2012, launched aboard a Soyuz spacecraft Soyuz TMA-06M and housed in an aquarium aboard the International Space Station. = Inbreeding lines = The possibility of serial inbreeding facilitates genetic research due to reduction of heterozygous sites in the genome. In medaka it is relatively easy to establish inbred lines, unlike other model species like zebrafish and mice. By 1979, researchers had generated 10 inbred strains. These inbred lines made medaka a model species for scientific research in genetics. In 2014, work began on generating 111 different inbred lines derived from a single population collected in the wild. = Understanding of Sex and Reproduction = Medaka reproduce on a daily basis, which is an optimal trait for studying their reproductive biology. Researchers have studied HPG axis activities intensively in this species. Moreover, the medaka is the first non- mammalian vertebrate species for which a sex-determination gene (DMY) has been identified, their sex is reversible by sex steroid manipulation, and they exhibit morphological sexual dimorphism between males and females. Furthermore, some methods such as ovariectomy and altered light-dark cycles have been developed to study the mechanism of reproduction in medaka. = Immunology = The discovery that T-lymphocytes home to the thymus in medaka has led to an understanding that this is not specific to mammalians but can be found in other vertebrates.  Conservation  = Status = The medaka is listed as a least-concern species in the IUCN red list. The justification of this categorization is that this species is living in widespread habitat (755,000 km2) and is relatively abundant in its various habitats. However, it is considered an endangered species by Japan's Ministry of the Environment. Many local communities try to preserve wild medaka in Japan. = Concerns = There are two major concerns about medaka conservation: habitat degradation and hybridization with domesticated medaka (himedaka). Due to modernization of rice fields and irrigation canals, optimal places for medaka reproduction are massively decreasing. In addition, recent studies confirmed that himedaka have been introduced into many local regions by artificial release. This will eliminate local genetic adaptations of each sub-population of medaka. Furthermore, since himedaka have vivid orange body color, the hybrids will attract more predators and thus decrease the total medaka population. In 2011, researchers discovered that almost 15% of wild-caught medaka in Nara had a himedaka-specific gene marker. In addition to these concerns, invasive species like mosquitofish compete with medaka by sharing the same habitat. A study reported that over 70% of medaka had their tail fins injured by attacks from mosquitofish. The damage at the anal fin will decrease medaka offspring by preventing courtship behavior. In 2006, it was found that a transgenic line of medaka was brought to Japan from Taiwan for commercial purposes. This transgenic line had an introduced gene which expresses green fluorescence, making the body glow. Now, this transgenic line has been released into the wild and is causing genetic pollution. There is no comprehensive study of population size of medaka, but the genomic analysis of one medaka sub- population indicates that their effective population size is around 25000-70000.  Social importance in Japan  The medaka has been kept as a domesticated pet in Japan for centuries. In recent years the fish has gained further popularity, with some rarer breeds valued at over 1 million yen (approximately US$10,000)—though the most common varieties (like himedaka) can be purchased for around 50 yen per fish. Currently, 456 commercial strains are documented and available for fishkeeping. Medaka are not only kept as pets but also widely utilized in education; Japanese elementary school classes often raise medaka in order to give the students firsthand experience with caring for live organisms, as well as to foster more broad appreciation for animals' life cycles.

A total community event, the Connecticut Agricultural Fair was a not-for-profit event run solely by over 300 volunteers from all corners of Connecticut and beyond. The Connecticut Agricultural Fair offered three days of family-oriented recreation including contests; livestock exhibits; commercial displays; live national, regional, and local entertainment; youth and junior fair activities; equipment displays; and tractor pulls. The Connecticut Agricultural Fair was designated as a “Major” fair in Connecticut, a member of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions (IAFE), as well as the Connecticut Association of Fairs.  History  The Connecticut Agricultural Fair was founded in 1967 by the members and granges of the Connecticut State Grange. Their mission then, and today, is to promote agriculture and to educate the public about its importance in everyone's lives. The first Connecticut Agricultural Fair was held on the Durham Fairgrounds, where it was held until the mid-1980s when the fair moved to its final location on the Goshen Fairgrounds in Litchfield County, in the foothills of the Berkshire Mountains. In 2006, the Connecuticut State Grange canceled the fair permanently.

It is situated on the river Schwarze Elster, 11 km southwest of Senftenberg, 110 km south of Berlin and 40 km north of Dresden. The little river Pössnitz runs through the eastern part of Schwarzheide.  Neighbouring communities  Immediate neighbors of the town are the towns Ruhland (south), Lauchhammer (west), Schipkau (north) and Senftenberg with the district Brieske (east).  Districts  Schwarzheide has the following districts Webseite der Stadt → Stadtentwicklungskonzept, S. 12 * Schwarzheide- West (former Zschornegosda) * Wandelhof * Schwarzheide-Mitte * Schwarzheide- Ost, consisting of Victoria and Naundorf  History  The town's landmark is the watertower. Today´s industrial town, Schwarzheide, was created on October 1, 1936, from the independent communities, Zschornegosda (today Schwarzheide- West) and Naundorf (now part of Schwarzheide-Ost). The name was translated from the Sorbian name, \\"Zschornegosda\\", (corny = black, gozd = heath, wood). The date of foundation of this community is unknown. Zschornegosda and Naundorf were founded in the 12th or the 13th century after the Christianization of the Sorbs. The first written evidence of Naundorf (as Nuwendorff) came from a pledge deed from 1421. Zschornegosda was first written in 1449 (as Cschörnegast) in feudal deed of Duke Frederick II, Elector of Saxony. Naundorf is a typical street village. Zschornegosda is a rotunde called okolnica. The chapel was on the highest point of a sandy knoll. The development of both villages was retarded by wars, fires, and epidemics. Until the 18th century, the villages had no more than 100 inhabitants. In 1780, the discovery of lignite coal west of Zschornegosda in Bockwitz lead to mining and the foundation of briquette factories (Ferdinand, Victoria, Victoria II). The river, Schwarze Elster, was drained and converted to a canal, so it was no longer possible to live from fishing. Highway A13 was built in 1936. ;World War II: In 1937, Brabag () completed the Brabag II facility in Ruhland- Schwarlheide (the 4th Nazi Germany Fischer-Tropsch plant) to produce gasoline and diesel fuel from lignite coal. The plant was a target of the Oil Campaign of World War II, used Sachsenhausen concentration camp forced labor, and became a post-war Soviet Joint Stock Company. The factory became VEB Synthesewerk Schwarzheide on January 1, 1954. When the village's population reached eight-thousand inhabitants, the village became a town on January 11, 1967. After 1990, Synthesewerk Schwarzheide became a part of BASF AG, which manufactures polyurethane. = Political affinity = The river, Schwarze Elster, forms the border between lower and upper Lusatia. From 1635, both Zschornegosda and Naundorf were part of Saxony. In 1815 both villages came to Prussia because of the Congress of Vienna. Between 1818 and 1952, Zschornegosda and Naundorf were part of Kreis Calau. From 1952 to 1990, Schwarzheide was a part of Kreis Senftenberg in Bezirk Cottbus. In 1990, town was annexed to Brandenburg, and, on December 6, 1993, to Oberspreewald- Lausitz.

Background  He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Henry and Pauline Waber. Although he started a degree in finance at the University of Pennsylvania, he left school to enlist in the military at the onset of World War II. From 1942 to 1945, Waber served the United States Army as a staff sergeant. Immediately following the end of the war, he returned to his studies at the Philadelphia College of Art. Waber graduated and earned his degree in 1951. Upon graduation, Waber launched his career as a commercial artist. Soon after, he began illustrating and writing children's books. At the age of 28, Bernard married Ethel Bernstein, and the couple moved to New York City and had three children. When his children were young, Waber worked in the art department of Condé Nast Publications, writing his books at night and on the weekends.  Writing  Waber wrote numerous children's books about the adventures of animals, including Do You See a Mouse?, Evie and Margie, An Anteater named Arthur, and A Lion Named Shirley Williamson. Waber's Lyle series, started in 1962, was his most well-known set of children's books. In the books, Lyle is a city-dwelling crocodile that lives in a bathtub. Lyle's character brings joy to everyone he meets. In 1954, Waber wrote his first illustrated book My Egg, Your Egg! by Eleanor Estes is published by G.P. Putnam's Sons. Shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Waber wrote the book Courage. In the book, through various characters, children are taught the meaning of bravery. Waber died May 16, 2013, from kidney failure. At the time of his death, his publishing company, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, said that his 33 books had sold a total of 1.75 million copies.

It stars Alec Baldwin, supported by John Lone, Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen, Jonathan Winters, Peter Boyle, and Tim Curry. The film is based on the pulp fiction character of the same name created in 1931 by Walter B. Gibson. The film was released to theaters on July 1, 1994, received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure. Critics found the villain, screenplay, and storyline lacking, but praised the film's direction, acting, special effects, visual style, action sequences, and its music score by Jerry Goldsmith. Plot In Tibet, following the First World War, American Lamont Cranston, succumbing to his dark instincts, sets himself up as a warlord and opium kingpin under the alias of 'Yin-Ko' (said to mean 'Dark Eagle' in a Mandarin Chinese dialect). He is abducted by servants of the Tulku, a holy man who exhibits otherworldly powers and knows Cranston's identity. He offers Cranston a chance to redeem himself and become a force for good. Cranston refuses but is silenced by the 'Phurba', a mystical, sentient, flying, three- edged dagger. Ultimately, Cranston remains a student under the Tulku for seven years. In addition to undergoing rigorous physical training, he learns how to hypnotize others, read their minds, and bend their perceptions so that he cannot be seen, except for his shadow. Returning to New York City, Cranston resumes his former life as a wealthy playboy, while secretly operating as The Shadow, a vigilante who terrorizes the city's underworld. He recruits some of the people he saves from criminals, to act as his agents, providing him with information and specialist knowledge. Cranston's secret identity is endangered upon meeting Margo Lane, a socialite who is also telepathic. Shiwan Khan, the Tulku's rogue protégé and a murderer whose powers apparently surpass those of Cranston, wakes up inside the sarcophagus that once held his ancestor, the Mongol Empire founder Genghis Khan, retrieved from his unmarked burial site. Khan uses hypnosis to make a security guard shoot himself in the head, after the guard refuses to join his army. Khan plans to fulfill his ancestor's goal of world domination. He offers Cranston an alliance, but the latter refuses. Cranston acquires a rare coin from Khan, and learns that it is made of a metal called 'bronzium' (an impure form of uranium) that theoretically can generate an atomic explosion. He also learns that Margo's father, Reinhardt (a scientist working on building an atomic device for the Department of War), has disappeared. Cranston deduces that Khan needs Reinhardt and his invention to complete an atomic bomb. Khan hypnotizes Margo and commands her to kill The Shadow. She goes to Cranston's home, but after trying to kill him, Cranston breaks Khan's hypnotic hold on her. Because she was ordered to kill The Shadow and instinctively went to Cranston's home, she now realizes that he is The Shadow. After Reinhardt's assistant Farley Claymore allies with Khan, Cranston prepares to rescue Margo's father, but is thwarted by Khan's henchmen. The Shadow finally discovers Khan's location: the luxurious Hotel Monolith, a building in the middle of the city that Khan has rendered forgotten and invisible to everyone. Knowing Reinhardt has completed the bomb under hypnotic control, The Shadow enters the hotel for a final showdown with Khan. The Shadow fights his way through the building and hypnotically influences Claymore to jump from a balcony to his death, after Claymore attempts to kill him. Finding Khan, The Shadow is subdued by the Phurba. He realizes that only a peaceful mind can truly control the mystical dagger, and he finally seizes it. The Shadow launches it into Khan's torso, creating a lapse in Khan's hypnotic control that frees Reinhardt and restores the hotel's public visibility. The Shadow pursues Khan into the bowels of the building, while Margo and Reinhardt disarm the bomb. The Shadow defeats Khan by telekinetically hurling a broken shard of mirror glass into Khan's frontal lobe. A confused Khan awakes in the padded cell of a mental hospital, and discovers that his powers are gone. One of the doctors (also an agent of The Shadow) tells Khan that they were able to save his life by removing a part of his brain 'that nobody uses', which in reality controlled Khan's psychic abilities. Soon after, Cranston and Margo begin a serious relationship and join forces to fight the criminal underworld. Cast Alec Baldwin as Lamont Cranston / The Shadow * John Lone as Shiwan Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan * Penelope Ann Miller as Margo Lane * Peter Boyle as Moses \\"Moe\\" Shrevnitz * Ian McKellen as Dr. Reinhardt Lane * Tim Curry as Farley Claymore * Jonathan Winters as Wainwright Barth * Sab Shimono as Dr. Roy Tam * Andre Gregory as Burbank * James Hong as Li Peng * Joseph Maher as Isaac Newboldt * Max Wright as Berger * Ethan Phillips as Nelson * Frank Welker as the voice of Phurba Production Producer Martin Bregman bought the rights to The Shadow in 1982. Robert Zemeckis had been involved with a film adaptation in the 1980s, while Sam Raimi's pitch was ignored. Universal allowed Raimi to develop an original treatment inspired by The Shadow in 1987 with the development of Darkman. David Koepp had listened to the radio serial of The Shadow as a child, when CBS re-ran it on Sunday nights. Koepp was hired in 1990 to write a new draft, and was able to find the right tone that the studio liked. Bregman remembers, 'Some of them were light, some of them were darker, and others were supposedly funnier – which they weren't. It just didn’t work.' Koepp's script relied predominantly on the pulp novels while taking the overall tone from the radio show, with the actual plot originated by Koepp himself in consultation with Bregman. In an attempt to differentiate The Shadow from other superhero films of the time, Koepp 'focused on the copy line, 'Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?' and wondered how [the Shadow] knew what evil lurks in the hearts of men. And I decided that perhaps it was because he was uncomfortably familiar with the evil in his own heart.' For Koepp, the film then became 'a story of guilt and atonement'. He picked Shiwan Khan as the film’s villain because 'he was bold and he knew what he was doing – he wanted to conquer the world. That was very simple, maybe a little ambitious, but he knew exactly what he wanted.' He had always been a fan of Alec Baldwin and wrote the script with him in mind: 'He has the eyes and the voice; he had so much of what I pictured Cranston being.' Koepp also sat in on rehearsals, and incorporated a lot of the actor’s humor into the script. The Shadow was shot on the Universal backlot in Hollywood on five sound-stages over sixty days with a five-day mini-unit tour of location shooting, and a week lost when an earthquake destroyed the Hall of Mirrors set. Mulcahy said, 'There are a lot of FX in this film, but it's not a FX film. It's a character/story-driven film. The FX are part of the story.' Soundtrack The original score for The Shadow was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, who used his (at the time) signature music style for big orchestra, supported by a prominent percussion section, and musical effects with the help of instruments, especially synthesizers. Among the leitmotifs of his score are a romantically dark, yet lush heroic melodical main theme for the protagonist, which is accompanied by several secondary themes. For the antagonist, rather than a fully developed theme, Goldsmith used a musical effect in horns and synthesizers imitating a howling sound, a technique that would later echo in his scores for The Ghost and the Darkness (1996) and The Edge (1997). Camille Saint-Saëns's 1872 composition \\"Le Rouet d'Omphale\\" (\\"Omphale's Spinning Wheel\\"), which introduced the radio serial, was not used within the film's score. For the album and end credits, Jim Steinman composed the pop-song \\"Original Sin\\", performed by Taylor Dayne - this had originally appeared on the album of the same name, recorded by the girl group Pandora's Box. Diane Warren also composed a period-style big-band piece, \\"Some Kind of Mystery\\", performed by Sinoa during the film's night club scene. =Original album= The Arista Records label released a soundtrack album in 1994. The soundtrack featured selections from Goldsmith's score and the songs from the film, \\"Original Sin\\" appearing in two different versions.The Shadow soundtrack review at Filmtracks.com Track listing # 'The Shadow Knows', 1994 - Alec Baldwin (0:08) # Original Sin (Theme from The Shadow) - Taylor Dayne (6:27) # The Poppy Fields (Main Title) (3:16) # Some Kind of Mystery (Warren) - Sinoa (3:48) # The Sanctum (3:33) # Who Are You?

It suffered from competition for its target audience with, among others, The Lion King (earlier during its run) and The Mask (later on), and was ultimately a financial disappointment. The film started off strongly, debuting at No. 2, but failed to sustain any momentum, and grossed $32 million domestically, with a worldwide total of $48 million against a budget of $40 million. The planned franchise never materialized. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, The Shadow film has an approval rating of 35%, based on reviews from 48 critics. The website's consensus states: 'Bringing a classic pulp character to the big screen, The Shadow features impressive visual effects, but the story ultimately fails to strike a memorable chord.' Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"B\\" on scale of A to F. Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly gave the film a grade 'D', adding: 'The trouble with setting a special-effects fantasy in the low- tech ’20s is that unless the American-kitsch elements are injected with something approaching Steven Spielberg's speedy bravado, we become all too aware that the actors are simply standing around B-movie sets spouting cardboard dialogue.' (Entertainment Weekly would later place the film on its list of the \\"21 Worst Comic-Book Movies Ever\\".) Michael Wilmington, writing for the Chicago Tribune, gave his take on the film: \\"The Shadow shows what can happen when you overdress pulp. You wind up with something gorgeous and suffocated, bejeweled trash floundering in its own over-splendid stuffings.\\" Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and said: 'If you respond to film noir, if you like dark streets and women with scarlet lips and big fast cars with running boards, the look of this movie will work some kind of magic.' The Shadow has developed a cult following in subsequent years, a result of its video success on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray - much like three other 1990s pulp/comic adaptations, Dick Tracy, The Rocketeer and The Phantom. = Year-end lists = Honorable mention – David Elliott, The San Diego Union-Tribune * Honorable mention – Michael MacCambridge, Austin American-Statesman In other media =Novelization= James Luceno wrote the novelization which went deeper into the events of the film and included many nods to the radio serial of The Shadow and the original pulp magazines, most significantly alluding to the fact that true identity of The Shadow was Kent Allard, and that 'Lamont Cranston' was just another identity he assumed when needed. =Video game= A video game version of The Shadow for the Super NES was developed to tie in with the 1994 film, but was never released (despite being completed) due to the film's disappointing box-office gross. ROM files of the game were later leaked onto the internet. =Pinball game= Midway (under the Bally label) released a Shadow-themed pinball machine in 1994. Brian Eddy (of Attack From Mars and Medieval Madness fame) designed the game. It was his first pinball game design, and it was moderately successful. Dan Forden composed its original music.

Geography  The town of Sebnitz lies in the valley of the River Sebnitz and its side valleys between 251 and 460 m above sea level between the mountains of Saxon Switzerland and the Lusatian Highlands. Topographically the town itself lies in the West Lusatian Upland, but lies right on the border with the Upper Lusatian Highlands. Because the natural region of Saxon Switzerland is also very close by, the countryside around the town is very varied. The local hill of Sebnitz is the Tanečnice (Tanzplan) which is on Czech territory. The municipality consists of the town Sebnitz itself, Schönbach (joined 1935), Hainersdorf (joined 1920), Hertigswalde (joined 1950), Hinterhermsdorf (joined 1998) and the former municipality of Kirnitzschtal (joined 2012), that itself consisted of the villages Altendorf, Mittelndorf, Lichtenhain, Ottendorf and Saupsdorf.  History  Sebnitz was first mentioned in a document of 1223/1241 outlining the borders between the kingdom of Bohemia and the diocese of Meißen. In 1451 it was first mentioned as a town. A new town hall was built in 1714/1715, but was destroyed together with numerous other buildings, among them the school house, in a fire in 1854. Around 1900 Sebnitz became a centre of the manufacture of artificial flowers. From 1952 until 1994 the town was the administrative centre of the district Sebnitz. In 1997, 6 year old German-Iraqi Joseph Kantelberg-Abdulla, who suffered from a heart condition, had a heart attack and drowned in the local public swimming pool as neither mother nor 12-year-old sister looked after him. Three years later, his mother claimed that the boy had been tortured and drowned by no less than 50 neo-Nazis, wearing boots, tattoos, and all. While Der Spiegel did not buy the story, tabloid Bild took full advantage, dragging the town into national spotlight for about a week until the mother was being investigated by police for encouraging false accusations. Sebnitz hosted the Festival \\"Tag der Sachsen\\" in 2003. In October 2015 around 3000 people protested against the migration policy of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and built a symbolic 'living frontier' (\\"lebende Grenze\\") against asylum seekers. Transport Sebnitz railway station is located at Rumburk–Sebnitz railway, which connects here to Bautzen–Bad Schandau railway. Train services are operated by Städtebahn Sachsen (Pirna–Neustadt–Sebnitz) and DB Regio (in cooperation with České dráhy) (Rumburk–Dolní Poustevna–Sebnitz–Bad Schandau–Děčín hl.n.), mostly every two hours. The Kirnitzschtalbahn, a rural tramway, serves the Lichtenhain Waterfall from Bad Schandau.

Completed in 1928, control of the bridge was acquired by the Beesley's Point Bridge Company. It was a toll bridge from its opening. Prior to its closing, it was best known for carrying U.S. Route 9 (US 9) over the Great Egg Harbor Bay, connecting Upper Township, in Cape May County to Somers Point in Atlantic County. The bridge concurrently carried the Garden State Parkway over the Great Egg Harbor Bay from the Parkway's opening in 1954 until a separate bridge over the bay for the Parkway, the Great Egg Harbor Bridge, opened in 1955. Through the decades, the Beesley's Point Bridge Company became unable to fund repairs on the aging bridge. In 1997, the bridge company, in conjunction with private outside investors, secured a $1 million loan from the New Jersey Department of Transportation to fund the necessary improvements in exchange for a promise that they would continue to keep the bridge open until 2016. In 2004, the owners of the bridge broke that promise realizing that the repairs would cost many times more than the original estimate. As a result, the Company agreed to close the bridge and it closed to traffic on June 18, 2004. US 9 was subsequently rerouted over the Great Egg Harbor Bridge. History In 1928, the Ocean City Automobile Club financed the construction of the Beesley's Point Bridge, connecting Somers Point to Beesley's Point via the Great Egg Harbor Bay. The remnants of the Beesley's Point Bridge in June 2018 In 2006, Hurricane Ernesto made Cape May County officials nervous because they lacked the use of the bridge as an additional evacuation route. As a result, Cape May County purchased the bridge from the Beesley's Point Bridge Company for $1 with the intent of rehabilitating it and opening it in 2012. Several studies have been commissioned for the feasibility of doing so, but Cape May County engineers can only conclude that significant rehabilitation would only produce an extended life of up to 15 years. Costs vary on the price of rehabilitation, but it appears that only a 15-year realization on the investment is not worth the cost. The NJDOT planned to fund a project to rehabilitate the bridge to at least 2019 in their Statewide Transportation Program 2011-2019.FY 2010 - 2019 STATEWIDE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM Cape May County officials, including Democrat Jeff Van Drew, stated that bridge rehabilitation would begin in mid-2010 and the bridge would reopen to traffic in 2012. On June 28, 2010 the Press of Atlantic City published an article revealing a previous crack in the existing deck had turned into a three-foot chasm. At the 7th Annual Cape May County Transportation Infrastructure Conference on February 22, 2011, it was announced that the bridge would be demolished but discussions were in the preliminary mode. Demolition of the bridge began in July 2013 in conjunction with a project that will also replace the Great Egg Harbor Bridge. On September 7, 2016 the toll bridge section caught fire. The last section of the bridge was demolished on November 18, 2016.  Design  The old alignment of the Garden State Parkway at the Beesley's Point Bridge heading southbound.

The structure immediately north over the Drag Channel was a separate structure and is commonly referred to incorrectly as the same structure resulting in an erroneous 6,000 foot total length. The bridge contained 120 spans and had an 80-foot double leaf bascule span that opened for maritime traffic. The official NJDOT Historic Bridge Survey states that the substructure had been heavily reconstructed.NEW JERSEY HISTORIC BRIDGE DATA The bascule span received modern controls and electrical systems during the rehabilitation. Access to the mechanical rooms were denied for the final bridge inspection, but topside inspection revealed that the bascule appears heavily altered and thus is not eligible for historic preservation.

He was called the \\"father of Kansas City barbecue.\\" Perry was born in Shelby County, Tennessee near Memphis and worked on steamboat restaurants on the Mississippi River and Missouri River before moving to Kansas City, Missouri in 1907. In 1908 he began serving smoked meats to workers in the Garment District in Downtown Kansas City from an alley stand. He then moved his stand, \\"Perry's Barbecue\\", to 17th and Lydia in the inner city neighborhood of 18th Street and Vine. He later moved a few blocks away within the neighborhood of 19th and Highland, where he operated out of an old trolley barn throughout the 1920s and 1930s when the neighborhood became famed for its Kansas City Jazz during the Tom Pendergast era. Customers paid 25 cents for hot meat smoked over oak and hickory and wrapped in newsprint. Perry's sauce was described as \\"harsh, peppery\\" (rather than sweet). Perry’s menu included such barbecue standards of the day as beef and wild game such as possum, woodchuck, and raccoon. On March 22, 1940 at 5:55 A.M., Perry died in Kansas City due to pneumonia and complications from an infection. At his death, Charlie Bryant took over the business; he, in turn, sold it to his brother Arthur, who made the sauce a little sweeter when he relocated the restaurant, Arthur Bryant's, to 1727 Brooklyn in the same neighborhood. Also, Arthur Pinkard, who had worked for Perry, helped George Gates found Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q.

Currently it plays in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football. History Founded in 1912, Pontedera, a team from a city in the Pisa neighbourhood, played Serie C for several years without never gaining a single promotion to Serie B. In 1993/1994, a second place in Serie C2/B allowed Pontedera to be promoted to Serie C1: during that season, the team was known for having longily been the only undefeated team in all Italian professional leagues, and for having incredibly won 2–1 to the Italy national football team coached by Arrigo Sacchi in a friendly match played in April 1994. Pontedera played Serie C1 just in 1994/1995, and relegated to Serie D in 2001, and even Eccellenza in 2002. Pontedera returned to Serie D in 2005, after having won its Eccellenza round. In summer 2006, The Gunther Corporation purchased Pontedera. It was reported in The Guardian newspaper on 17 May 2007 that the owner of Pontedera is a dog named Gunther IV, who inherited it from Gunther III who in turn inherited it from his owner Countess Libenstein. Marcello Lippi, head coach of Italy national team and World Cup champion in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, started his professional managing career as Pontedera head coach in 1985–1986. =Serie D 2010–11= At the end of the 2010-11 Serie D season, Pontedera gained access to the Serie D play-off for promotion in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, but they were eliminated in the third round. =Back into professionalism= In the 2012-13 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione season, Pontedera finished second in Girone B, and was promoted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione. This was the second consecutive promotion for the team. The 2013–14 season saw Pontedera topping the Lega Pro Prima Divisione table for the earlier weeks of the season, and then completing the regular season in eighth place and thus ensuring a Serie B promotion playoff spot, then losing to Lecce on penalties in the first round.

He reportedly experienced angelic visions of the afterlife. Fursey is one of the Four Comely Saints. Early life He was born in the region of modern-day Connacht supposedly the son of Fintan and grandson of Finlog, pagan king of the area. His mother was Gelges, the Christian daughter of Aed-Finn, king of Connacht. He was born probably amongst the Hy-Bruin, and was baptised by St Brendan the Traveller, his father's uncle, who then ruled a monastery in the Island of Oirbsen, now called Inisquin in Lough Corrib. He was educated by St Brendan's monks, and when he became of the proper age he was inducted into the monastery at Inisquin (near Galway), under the Abbot St Meldan, his \\"soul-friend\\" (anam- chura), where he devoted himself to religious life. His great sanctity was early discerned, and there is a legend that here, through his prayers, twin children of a chieftain related to King Brendinus were raised from the dead. He built his own monastery at Killursa outside the town of Headford in modern Co. Galway and he became the patron saint of the Parish of Headford. Visions He was said to have been something of an ascetic, wearing thin clothing year round. Aspirants came in numbers to place themselves under his rule, but he wished to secure also some of his relatives for the new monastery. For this purpose he set out with some monks for Munster, but on coming near his father's home he was seized with an apparently mortal illness. He fell into a trance from the ninth hour of the day to cock-crow, and while in this state received the first of the ecstatic visions which have made him famous in medieval literature. In this vision were revealed to him the state of man in sin, the beauty of virtue. He heard the angelic choirs singing \\"the saints shall go from virtue to virtue, the God of Gods will appear in Sion.\\" An injunction was laid on him by the two angels who appeared to restore him to his body to become a more zealous labourer for the Lord. Three nights later, the ecstasy was renewed. He was taken to the heavens by three angels who contended six times with demons for his soul. He saw the fires of hell, the strife of demons, and then heard the angel hosts sing in four choirs \\"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts.\\" Among the spirits of those just made perfect he recognized Saints Meldan and Beoan. They entertained him with much spiritual instruction concerning the duties of ecclesiastics and monks, the dreadful effects of pride and disobedience, and the heinousness of spiritual and internal sins. They also predicted famine and pestilence. As he returned through the fire the demon hurled a tortured sinner at him, burning him, and the angel of the Lord said to him, \\"Because thou didst receive the mantle of this man when dying in his sin the fire consuming him hath scarred thy body also.\\" Fursey's body bore the mark from that day forward. Exactly twelve months later he received a third vision. This time, the angel remained with him a whole day, instructed him for his preaching, and prescribed for him twelve years of apostolic labour. This he faithfully fulfilled in Ireland, and then stripping himself of all earthly goods he retired for a time to a small island in the ocean. After some years he founded a monastery at Rathmat on the shore of Lough Corrib which Colgan identifies as Killursa, in the deanery of Annadown. His brothers Foillan and Ultan then joined the community at Rathmat, but Fursey seems to have renounced the administration of the monastery and to have devoted himself to preaching throughout the land, frequently exorcising evil spirits.  Mission to East Anglia  Fursey was the first recorded Irish missionary to Anglo-Saxon England. He arrived in East Anglia with his brothers, Foillan and Ultan, during the 630s shortly before St Aidan founded his monastery on Holy Island. The conversion of the Kingdom of East Anglia to Christianity began under Raedwald, but halted with the martyrdom of Raedwald's successor, his son Eorpwald. Sigeberht of East Anglia was already Christian when he took the throne around 630. By 633, Sigeberht of East Anglia had established the first East Anglian bishopric at Dommoc and appointed a Burgundian Bishop named Felix. When Fursey arrived with his brothers Foillan and Ultan, as well as other brethren, bearing the relics of Saints Meldan and Beoan, he had been welcomed by the king, who gave him land to establish an abbey at Cnobheresburg, where there was an abandoned Roman fort, traditionally identified with Burgh Castle in Norfolk.The fort at Burgh Castle was excavated by Charles Green during 1958-61. In a detailed report written by the Norfolk Museums Service in 1983, in East Anglian Archaeology, volume 20, the establishment of a monastic settlement in Burgh Castle has been disputed. Here he laboured for some years converting the Picts and Saxons. After Sigeberht was slain by an army led by Penda of Mercia, it is recorded that his successor King Anna of East Anglia, and his nobles, further endowed the monastery at Cnobheresburg. Three miracles are recorded of Fursey's life in this monastery. He then retired for a year to live with Ultan the life of an anchorite. However, as great numbers continued to visit him, and as war threatened in East Anglia, he left Foillan as abbot and proceeded to Lagny, in France around 644. monument to St. Fursey, Bellefontaine  Mission in Neustria  He arrived in France in 648. Passing through Ponthieu, in a village near Mézerolles he found grief and lamentation on all sides, for the only son of Duke Hayson, the lord of that area, was dead. At the prayer of Fursey the body was restored. Pursuing his journey to Neustria he cured many infirmities on the way. He converted a robber, who had attacked the monks in a wood near Corbie, and his family through miracles. He also cured the inhospitable worldling Ermelinda, who had refused to harbour the weary travellers. His fame preceded him to Péronne, where he was joyfully received by Erchinoald, and through his prayers obtained the reprieve of six criminals. He was offered any site in the king's dominions for a monastery. He selected Latiniacum (Lagny), close to Chelles and about six miles from Paris, a spot beside the Marne, at that time covered with shady woods and abounding in fruitful vineyards. Here he built his monastery and three chapels, one dedicated to Jesus Christ the Saviour, one to St Peter, and the third, an unpretending structure, was later dedicated to St Fursey himself. Many of his Irish countrymen were attracted to his rule at Lagny, including Emilian, Eloquius, Mombulus, Adalgisius, Etto, Bertuin, Fredegand, Lactan, and Malguil. His journeys continued and many churches in Picardy are dedicated to him. He received some premonitions of his end, and set out to visit his brothers Foillan and Ultan who had by this time recruited the scattered monks of Cnobheresburg and re-established that monastery. Death He died about 650 at Mézerolles while on a journey. The village was for some time called Forsheim, which translated as the house of Fursey. He was buried in a church (built specially by Earconwald) in Péronne which has claimed him as patron ever since. Many unusual events attended the transmission of his remains, and his body was eventually buried in the portico of the church of St Peter where Fursey had earlier placed the relics of Saints Meldan and Beoan. His body lay unburied for thirty days pending the dedication of the church, and was during that time visited by pilgrims from all parts, incorrupt and emitting a sweet odour. At the end of that time, it was buried near the altar of the church. Four years later, on February 9, his remains were moved from their earlier location by Saint Eligius, Bishop of Noyon, and Cuthbert, Bishop of Cambrai, to a new chapel specifically built to hold the remains to the east of the main altar. The city would later become a great centre of devotion to him.  Iconography and veneration  In art St Fursey is represented with two oxen at his feet in commemoration of the prodigy by which, according to legend, Erkinoald's claim to his body was made good; or he is represented striking water from the soil at Lagny with the point of his staff; or beholding a vision of angels, or gazing at the flames of purgatory and hell. It is disputed whether he was a bishop; he may have been a chorepiscopus. A litany attributed to him is among the manuscripts in Trinity College Dublin. An Irish prophecy is attributed to him by Harris. His feast day is 16 January.  In popular culture  James Joyce mentions S. Fursa in his book Ulysses, among a list of mostly Irish heroes and heroines. * The Unfortunate Fursey, a popular comic novel by Mervyn Wall describes the saint as a hapless poor soul tormented by visions of buxom women of a type that could only be imagined by the sex-starved Irish ecclesiastics, and bargaining with demons to escape the torments of religion. Further reading Eileen Gardiner, Visions of Heaven and Hell Before Dante (New York: Italica Press, 1989), pp. 51–55, provides an English translation of the Latin text of his vision of heaven and hell. *Buckley, Ann 'Nobilitate vigens Furseus' - The Medieval Office of St Fursey Fursey Pilgrims 2014. Foreword by the Rt Revd Graham James, the Bishop of Norwich Introduction by the Author *Brown, Michelle P. The Life of St Fursey: what we know and why it matters (Fursey Pilgrims, 2001, reprinted 2003, 2007) Fursey Occasional Paper number 1 Foreword by the Rt Revd Graham James, The Bishop of Norwich The inaugural Fursey Lecture was given by Michelle Brown in 2000. She gathers together the current state of knowledge about Fursey, following him from Ireland - to become the first Irish leader in the English church - to France, where he died; he became the object of veneration shortly afterwards. Brown reviews the sources for our knowledge of Fursey, both textual and from place-name studies. For Brown, Fursey represents 'charity and a sense of compassion', and is an ideal model for 'the ecumenical celebration of the Christian faith'. *Dunn, Marilyn The vision of St Fursey and the development of purgatory (Fursey Pilgrims, 2007) Fursey Occasional Paper number 2 The Visio of Fursey is recognized to contain one of the earliest coherent expressions of the idea of purgatory, which would not reach its fullest form until some six hundred years after Fursey's death. In her lecture, Marilyn Dunn considers the concept of purgatory and the place of the Visio in its development. *Roberts, Jane Guthlac of Crowland, a Saint for Middle England (Fursey Pilgrims, 2009) Fursey Occasional Paper number 3 Guthlac of Crowland was a near contemporary of Fursey, dying in 714, as well as being located not too far distant from the area of Fursey's English ministry. Jane Roberts highlights the story of Guthlac, then compares elements of the two saints' Lives. Although little remembered today, the once great abbey of Crowland, and hints of Guthlac in later English literature, testify to his significance in English historical tradition. *Hoggett, Richard Beyond Bede: The History and Archaeology of the East Anglian Missions (Fursey Pilgrims, 2010) Fursey Occasional Paper number 4 The Venerable Bede provides one principal source for our knowledge of Fursey; using Bede as a starting point, Richard Hoggett considers the historical and political context of Fursey's East Anglia, and presents the archaeological evidence for and against the competing identifications of Fursey's Cnobheresburg. *Casey, Aine The Vita Fursei and its use by Bede and Aelfric (Fursey Pilgrims, 2010) Fursey Occasional Paper number 5 *O Riain, Padraig Fursa's Irish Origins: Munster, Connacht or Ulster?

The route serves as a connector between its parent route, U.S. Route 9 (US 9), in the town of Champlain and US 11 in the village of Rouses Point. While US 9 bypasses Rouses Point to the west, NY 9B veers east to serve the village and the shoreline of Lake Champlain. NY 9B is the northernmost section of the Lakes to Locks Passage, an All-American Road. Modern NY 9B was the original alignment of US 9 through the town of Champlain. US 9 was moved onto its present alignment west of Rouses Point in the mid-1940s, at which time its former routing to Rouses Point became NY 9B. Route description NY 9B northbound in Rouses Point NY 9B begins at an isolated intersection with US 9 in the town of Champlain. The route initially heads to the northeast, crossing farmland and passing small patches of wooded areas. At Coopersville, the first named location along NY 9B, the highway crosses the Great Chazy River and turns to follow a more easterly routing toward Lake Champlain. NY 9B reaches the shoreline later, at which point the route makes a sharp turn to the north to follow the western edge of Lake Champlain. It serves a handful of lakeside homes before passing Point au Fer, a peninsula protruding southeastward into the lake. Along this stretch, NY 9B traverses mostly undeveloped areas located inland from the lake. North of Point au Fer, the route returns to the lake shore as it enters the village of Rouses Point, the second and final location along NY 9B's routing. The surroundings change immediately across the village line as the route, now named Lake Street, serves several residential streets that mark the southern fringe of Rouses Point. After two long blocks, the lakeside homes gradually begin to give way to commercial establishments as NY 9B approaches Champlain Street, an east–west street carrying US 11 into the village. NY 9B ends at Champlain Street while US 11 turns north to follow Lake Street toward Rouses Point's central business district and the Canadian border. The portion of NY 9B from Lake Shore Road—a county road that meets NY 9B in Coopersville—north to its end at US 11 in Rouses Point is the northernmost leg of the Lakes to Locks Passage, an All-American Road that continues south to Waterford along Lake Champlain, the Champlain Canal, and the Hudson River. History Northern terminus in Rouses Point In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 22, a discontinuous, unsigned legislative route that began at Troy and ended at the Canadian border near Rouses Point. The route entered the town of Champlain on what is now US 9 and followed it north to the modern junction of US 9 and NY 9B. Here, Route 22 turned east onto current NY 9B and continued east and north along it to access Rouses Point. Inside the village, it followed Lake Street north to Pratt Street, where it turned to the northwest and proceeded along modern NY 276 to the border crossing located midway between the villages of Champlain and Rouses Point. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the north half of legislative Route 22—from modern NY 8 near Riparius north to the Canadian border at Rouses Point—became part of NY 6. In 1927, U.S. Highways were first signed in New York, at which time NY 6 was mostly absorbed into the new US 9, including within the town of Champlain. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. US 9 was realigned in the mid-1940s to bypass Rouses Point to the west and proceed north through the village of Champlain on its way to Canada. Its former alignment to Rouses Point was redesignated as NY 9B, which initially continued north along Lake Street to the Canadian border by way of an overlap with US 11. The overlap remained in place as late as 1979; it was eliminated by 1993.

It was co-written and directed by Delmer Daves and tells a story set during the American Indian Wars: the survivors of an Indian massacre must rely on a man wanted for several murders to lead them out of danger. Plot Sheriff Bull Harper (George Mathews) has captured and is taking \\"Comanche\\" Todd (Richard Widmark), a white man who has lived most of his life among the Indians, to be tried for the murder of Harper's three brothers. The pair join a wagon train led by Colonel Normand (Douglas Kennedy). Jenny's young brother Billy is intrigued by Todd, who appreciates the boy's good-hearted attention. Harper's brutal treatment of Todd causes friction with some members of the wagon train. When the sheriff beats a lad for giving Todd a pipe to smoke, Todd takes advantage of the distraction to kill his tormentor with a dropped axe. That night, while six of the young people sneak away for a late night swim, Apaches kill everyone else, except Todd, who miraculously survives when the wagon to which he is handcuffed is pushed off a cliff. The Apaches are gathering to avenge the massacre of their own women and children by whites. It is up to Todd to lead the survivors to safety, despite the distrust of some of them. Along the way, he and Jenny (Felicia Farr) fall in love. The group manages to travel safely for five days, avoiding a large nearby Apache war party. Todd then notices that a small U.S. cavalry detachment has appeared and the Indians have broken camp, concealing themselves. Todd saves all from an ambush, but he is recognized by the army and brought to trial. He reveals that the Harpers murdered his family. After hearing from Jenny and others, about how Todd saved them all, General Howard takes pity on him and places him in the permanent \\"custody\\" of Jenny and Billy. Trivia Tommy Rettig, who plays Jenny's younger brother Billy, is re-united with Widmark. He played Widmark's son in both the 1950 film noir Panic in the Streets and the 1955 film The Cobweb.

Director Delmer Daves described the difficulty of finding a pristine location for the film, as his previous western, Broken Arrow (1950), had popularized the region. The film has some jarring continuity errors. During the last third of the film, Tommy Rettig's hair goes from being long and fair with a fringe, to being short back and sides and dark and brushed back, and then back again on two occasions, once in the same scene. It was shot in DeLuxe Color and CinemaScope. Reception =Critical response= Bosley Crowther of The New York Times dismissed it as \\"A familiar and unexciting journey across a plateau of western clichés\\", but commended George Mathews' portrayal of the sheriff, \\"The only character in the picture worth attention\\".

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Algoz e Tunes. In 2001 there were 2002 inhabitants, in an area of approximately : there were 167 residents per kilometre square. History The opinion that persists around the toponymic name of the area, Tunes, is that it was so named for the number of colonists from north Africa, primarily from Tunis. Those who believe in this origin site the medieval French marigold (Tagetes patula) flower of Tunes, a herbaceous plant similar to the carnation (with cut petals and yellow flower) and common here as well as in Tunisia. The civil parish was created on 4 October 1985, under Decree-law 130/85, making it the youngest of the parishes of Silves. The settlement developed primarily around the junction of various rail-lines that connected Lisbon to the Algarve. In the 19th century, the locality was dominated by a few agricultural settlers who dedicated themselves to wine production. The first barrios began to appear after the railway opened in Gateiras. What was planned initially was a station would be constructed in Algoz, near the village of Tunes. But, owing to the slope of the hills, the construction of the station was differed to several kilometres to the east. The population was composed primarily of workers for the railway. On 21 February 1889, the first train passed through Tunes on the Lisbon-Faro line. It was on the same line, specifically the Tunes-Lagos link, that the last steam-powered train was used in the Algarve (in 1972). It was also in 1972 that the first thermoelectric plant was inaugurated in the community. The economic changes in the country over time transformed the civil parish from one of agricultural and industry to a more tourist-oriented speciality.

The Abbess Emhild of the monastery Milz transferred the monasterial properties by this certificate to Fulda Abbey. In 1335, the emperor Ludwig der Bayer awarded Seßlach the status of town. This gave the residents the permission to fortify their settlement which they soon did. By 1343 the first town gate had been erected. Later that century, the town became the seat of an Amt and a Centgericht of the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg. Seßlach was part of the Hochstift Würzburg until secularization in 1803. Over the centuries, the town suffered more under the German Peasants' War (1525) than nearby Coburg and was also damaged and plundered during the Thirty Years' War, the Seven Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars. In 1810, the Amt Seßlach came to the Kingdom of Bavaria and gradually lost importance. In 1812, an Amtsgericht was established but in the 1929 Staatsreform it was sidelined. In 1972, Seßlach became part of the Landkreis Coburg. Attractions Seßlach is notable for its largely intact medieval town wall and overall historic appearance with few modern structures.

It is used throughout Vienna, including the Vienna Philharmonic and Wiener Staatsoper. History Vienna horn Valves of a Vienna horn, operated by long push-rods from the 3 teardrop lever keys (at right). During the nineteenth century, a number of experiments were made in adding valves to the natural horn to enable it to play chromatically without the need for hand-stopping. These experiments included adding piston valves (as used in modern trumpets) to a single F horn. The horn was still crooked, by inserting other tubing, to re-tune the instrument for music written in base keys other than F. Description The Vienna horn uses a unique form of double-cylinder valve associated with the Viennese firm Uhlmann of the 1840s known as a pumpenvalve. A pumpenvalve is similar to the standard piston valve, but it is not pushed directly inward. Instead, long push-rods reach across to each lever key (as with rotary valves), allowing either a fast or slow change in the valve, by lever speed. The pumpenvalve allows the air to flow straight when the valves are not actuated. When a valve is engaged, each cylinder redirects the air stream 90 degrees in one bend, lessening the resistance felt by the player. This type of valve is one of the many contributing factors to the liquid legato that is one of the trademarks of the Viennese school. However, the indirect linkage between the fingers and the valves can make the action slower and therefore make quick technical passages more difficult for the player.Barry Tuckwell, Horn, Macdonald, 1983, p. 50. The internal diameter of the Vienna horn is also smaller than more modern horns. This bore size and shape is actually very close to the design of the valve-less natural horns. The removable crooks (usually an F and A and/or B) are also smoothly tapered for the length of the horn. Thus, there is no \\"compromise\\" (of dual tubing) as found in the modern double horn and triple horn. Although subsequent developments, including the rotary valve and double horn, supplanted these horns in most places, the pumpenvalve horn was retained in Vienna because it sounds more like the natural horn: with a more mellow sound and arguably smoother legato. This is due in part to the piston valves and in part to the larger throated (but smaller diameter) bell-flare still used with these instruments. The Vienna horn has remained virtually unchanged since the mid-nineteenth century. Horn players who use the Vienna horn also use a natural horn mouthpiece, which is less concave than a typical double horn mouthpiece. A standard horn mouthpiece is more concave, partly to facilitate the playing of lower notes because of lower impedance of the double horn.

The usefulness of the k-calculus is its simplicity. It has been successfully used to teach special relativity to young children and also in relativity textbooks.For example, Woodhouse, NMJ (2003), Special Relativity, Springer, , pp.58–65For example, Many introductions to relativity begin with the concept of velocity and a derivation of the Lorentz transformation. Other concepts such as time dilation, length contraction, the relativity of simultaneity, the resolution of the twins paradox and the relativistic Doppler effect are then derived from the Lorentz transformation, all as functions of velocity. Bondi, in his book Relativity and Common Sense, (Also published in 1965 in Great Britain by Heinemann, and reprinted in 1980 by Dover.) first published in 1964 and based on articles published in The Illustrated London News in 1962, reverses the order of presentation. He begins with what he calls \\"a fundamental ratio\\" denoted by the letter k (which turns out to be the radial Doppler factor).d'Inverno (1992), p.40 From this he explains the twins paradox, and the relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction, all in terms of k. It is not until later in the exposition that he provides a link between velocity and the fundamental ratio k. The Lorentz transformation appears towards the end of the book. History The k-calculus method had previously been used by E. A. Milne in 1935.Milne, E.A. (1935), Relativity Gravitation and World Structure, Oxford University Press, pp.36–38 Milne used the letter s to denote a constant Doppler factor, but also considered a more general case involving non-inertial motion (and therefore a varying Doppler factor). Bondi used the letter k instead of s and simplified the presentation (for constant k only), and introduced the name \\"k-calculus\\".Bondi (1964), p.109 Bondi's k-factor thumbSpacetime diagram for definition of k-factor Consider two inertial observers, Alice and Bob, moving directly away from each other at constant relative velocity. Alice sends a flash of blue light towards Bob once every T seconds, as measured by her own clock. Because Alice and Bob are separated by a distance, there is a delay between Alice sending a flash and Bob receiving a flash. Furthermore, the separation distance is steadily increasing at a constant rate, so the delay keeps on increasing. This means that the time interval between Bob receiving the flashes, as measured by his clock, is greater than T seconds, say kT seconds for some constant k > 1. (If Alice and Bob were, instead, moving directly towards each other, a similar argument would apply, but in that case k < 1.)Bondi (1964) p.80 Bondi describes k as “a fundamental ratio”,Bondi (1964) p.88 and other authors have since called it \\"the Bondi k-factor\\" or \\"Bondi's k-factor\\".Woodhouse (2003), p.63 Alice's flashes are transmitted at a frequency of f_s = 1/T Hz, by her clock, and received by Bob at a frequency of f_o = 1/(kT) Hz, by his clock. This implies a Doppler factor of f_s / f_o = k. So Bondi's k-factor is another name for the Doppler factor (when source Alice and observer Bob are moving directly away from or towards each other). If Alice and Bob were to swap roles, and Bob sent flashes of light to Alice, the Principle of Relativity (Einstein's first postulate) implies that the k-factor from Bob to Alice would be the same value as the k-factor from Alice to Bob, as all inertial observers are equivalent. So the k-factor depends only on the relative speed between the observers and nothing else. The reciprocal k-factor thumbleftSpacetime diagram for the reciprocal k-factor Consider, now, a third inertial observer Dave who is a fixed distance from Alice, and such that Bob lies on the straight line between Alice and Dave. As Alice and Dave are mutually at rest, the delay from Alice to Dave is constant. This means that Dave receives Alice's blue flashes at a rate of once every T seconds, by his clock, the same rate as Alice sends them. In other words, the k-factor from Alice to Dave is equal to one.Bondi (1964) p.77 Now suppose that whenever Bob receives a blue flash from Alice he immediately sends his own red flash towards Dave, once every kT seconds (by Bob's clock). Einstein's second postulate, that the speed of light is independent of the motion of its source, implies that Alice's blue flash and Bob's red flash both travel at the same speed, neither overtaking the other, and therefore arrive at Dave at the same time. So Dave receives a red flash from Bob every T seconds, by Dave's clock, which were sent by Bob every kT seconds by Bob's clock. This implies that the k-factor from Bob to Dave is 1/k. This establishes that the k-factor for observers moving directly apart (red shift) is the reciprocal of the k-factor for observers moving directly towards each other at the same speed (blue shift). The twins paradox thumbSpacetime diagram for the twins paradox Consider, now, a fourth inertial observer Carol who travels from Dave to Alice at exactly the same speed as Bob travels from Alice to Dave. Carol's journey is timed such that she leaves Dave at exactly the same time as Bob arrives. Denote times recorded by Alice's, Bob's and Carol's clocks by t_A, t_B, t_C. When Bob passes Alice, they both synchronise their clocks to t_A=t_B=0. When Carol passes Bob, she synchronises her clock to Bob's, t_C=t_B. Finally, as Carol passes Alice, they compare their clocks against each other. In Newtonian physics, the expectation would be that, at the final comparison, Alice's and Carol's clock would agree, t_C=t_A. It will be shown below that in relativity this is not true. This is a version of the well-known \\"twins paradox\\" in which identical twins separate and reunite, only to find that one is now older than the other. If Alice sends a flash of light at time t_A=T towards Bob, then, by the definition of the k-factor, it will be received by Bob at time t_B=kT. The flash is timed so that it arrives at Bob just at the moment that Bob meets Carol, so Carol synchronises her clock to read t_C=t_B=kT. Also, when Bob and Carol meet, they both simultaneously send flashes to Alice, which are received simultaneously by Alice. Considering, first, Bob's flash, sent at time t_B=kT, it must be received by Alice at time t_A=k^2 T, using the fact that the k-factor from Alice to Bob is the same as the k-factor from Bob to Alice. As Bob's outward journey had a duration of kT, by his clock, it follows by symmetry that Carol's return journey over the same distance at the same speed must also have a duration of kT, by her clock, and so when Carol meets Alice, Carol's clock reads t_C=2kT. The k-factor for this leg of the journey must be the reciprocal 1/k (as discussed earlier), so, considering Carol's flash towards Alice, a transmission interval of kT corresponds to a reception interval of T. This means that the final time on Alice's clock, when Carol and Alice meet, is t_A=(k^2+1)T. This is larger than Carol's clock time t_C=2kT since :t_A- t_C=(k^2-2k+1)T = (k-1)^2 T > 0, provided k eq 1 and T > 0.Bondi (1964), pp.80–90 Radar measurements and velocity thumbleftSpacetime diagram for radar measurements In the k-calculus methodology, distances are measured using radar. An observer sends a radar pulse towards a target and receives an echo from it. The radar pulse (which travels at c, the speed of light) travels a total distance, there and back, that is twice the distance to the target, and takes time T_2 - T_1, where T_1 and T_2 are times recorded by the observer's clock at transmission and reception of the radar pulse. This implies that the distance to the target isWoodhouse (2003) p.60 :x_A = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} c(T_2-T_1). Furthermore, since the speed of light is the same in both directions, the time at which the radar pulse arrives at the target must be, according to the observer, halfway between the transmission and reception times, namely :t_A = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (T_2+T_1). In the particular case where the radar observer is Alice and the target is Bob (momentarily co-located with Dave) as described previously, by k-calculus we have T_2 = k^2 T_1, and so :x_A=\\\\tfrac{1}{2} c(k^2-1) T_1 :t_A=\\\\tfrac{1}{2} (k^2+1) T_1. As Alice and Bob were co-located at t_A=0, x_A=0, the velocity of Bob relative to Alice is given byBondi (1964), p.103Woodhouse (2003), p.64 :v=\\\\frac{x_A}{t_A} = \\\\frac{\\\\tfrac{1}{2} c(k^2-1) T_1}{\\\\tfrac{1}{2} (k^2+1) T_1} = c \\\\frac{k^2-1}{k^2+1} = c \\\\frac{k-k^{-1}}{k+k^{-1}}. This equation expresses velocity as a function of the Bondi k-factor. It can be solved for k to give k as a function of v:Bondi (1964), p.103Woodhouse (2003), p.65 :k = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}. Velocity composition thumbSpacetime diagram showing k-factor composition Consider three inertial observers Alice, Bob and Ed, arranged in that order and moving at different speeds along the same straight line. In this section, the notation k_{AB} will be used to denote the k-factor from Alice to Bob (and similarly between other pairs of observers). As before, Alice sends a blue flash towards Bob and Ed every T seconds, by her clock, which Bob receives every k_{AB} T seconds, by Bob's clock, and Ed receives every k_{AE} T seconds, by Ed's clock. Now suppose that whenever Bob receives a blue flash from Alice he immediately sends his own red flash towards Ed, once every k_{AB} T seconds by Bob's clock, so Ed receives a red flash from Bob every k_{BE} (k_{AB} T) seconds, by Ed's clock. Einstein's second postulate, that the speed of light is independent of the motion of its source, implies that Alice's blue flash and Bob's red flash both travel at the same speed, neither overtaking the other, and therefore arrive at Ed at the same time. Therefore, as measured by Ed, the red flash interval k_{BE} (k_{AB} T) and the blue flash interval k_{AE} T must be the same. So the rule for combining k-factors is simply multiplication:Bondi (1964) p.105 :k_{AE}=k_{AB} k_{BE}. Finally, substituting :k_{AB}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1+v_{AB}/c}{1-v_{AB}/c}}, \\\\, k_{BE}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1+v_{BE}/c}{1-v_{BE}/c}}, \\\\, v_{AE}=c \\\\frac{k_{AE}^2-1}{k_{AE}^2+1} gives the velocity composition formula :v_{AE}=\\\\frac{v_{AB} + v_{BE}}{1 + v_{AB}v_{BE}/c^2}. The invariant interval thumbleftSpacetime diagram for derivation of invariant interval and Lorentz transformation Using the radar method described previously, inertial observer Alice assigns coordinates (t_A, x_A) to an event by transmitting a radar pulse at time t_A-x_A/c and receiving its echo at time t_A+x_A/c, as measured by her clock. Similarly, inertial observer Bob can assign coordinates (t_B, x_B) to the same event by transmitting a radar pulse at time t_B-x_B/c and receiving its echo at time t_B+x_B/c, as measured by his clock. However, as the diagram shows, it is not necessary for Bob to generate his own radar signal, as he can simply take the timings from Alice's signal instead. Now, applying the k-calculus method to the signal that travels from Alice to Bob :k=\\\\frac{t_B-x_B/c}{t_A-x_A/c}. Similarly, applying the k-calculus method to the signal that travels from Bob to Alice :k=\\\\frac{t_A+x_A/c}{t_B+x_B/c}. Equating the two expressions for k and rearranging,Bondi (1964), p.118 :c^2 t_A^2-x_A^2=c^2 t_B^2-x_B^2. This establishes that the quantity c^2 t^2-x^2 is an invariant: it takes the same value in any inertial coordinate system and is known as the invariant interval. The Lorentz transformation The two equations for k in the previous section can be solved as simultaneous equations to obtain:Woodhouse (2003), p.67 :ct_B=\\\\tfrac{1}{2} (k+k^{-1} ) ct_A - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (k-k^{-1} ) x_A :x_B=\\\\tfrac{1}{2} (k+k^{-1} ) x_A - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (k-k^{-1} ) ct_A These equations are the Lorentz transformation expressed in terms of the Bondi k-factor instead of in terms of velocity. By substituting : k=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}, the more traditional form :t_B=\\\\frac{t_A- vx_A/c^2}{\\\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}; \\\\, x_B=\\\\frac{x_A-vt_A}{\\\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} is obtained. Rapidity Rapidity \\\\varphi can be defined from the k-factor byWoodhouse (2003), p.71 :\\\\varphi = \\\\log_e k, \\\\, k = e^\\\\varphi, and so :v = c \\\\frac{k-k^{-1}}{k+k^{-1}} = c \\\\tanh \\\\varphi. The k-factor version of the Lorentz transform becomes :ct_B = ct_A \\\\cosh \\\\varphi - x_A \\\\sinh \\\\varphi :x_B = x_A \\\\cosh \\\\varphi - ct_A \\\\sinh \\\\varphi It follows from the composition rule for k, k_{AE}=k_{AB} k_{BE}, that the composition rule for rapidities is addition: :\\\\varphi_{AE} = \\\\varphi_{AB} + \\\\varphi_{BE}.

Biography He was born on 14 March 1894 in Magaradzhik village in Kars Oblast, then in the Russian Empire (today in Mağaracık, Turkey) of Pontic Greek parents. The family name derives from triantáfyllo, τριαντάφυλλο, Modern Greek for the rose flower. His family had moved to Russia. Graduating from the Moscow Praporshchik School in 1915, he served in the Russian Army in World War I, earning the rank of captain. During the Russian Civil War, he rose in rank up to brigade commander while fighting on various fronts. In 1923, he was appointed chief of the Operations Directions of the Soviet General Staff and Deputy Chief of the General Staff. Vladimir Triandafillov was the author of two fundamental military doctrine works: Scale of the operations of modern armies, published in 1926 and Characteristics of the operations of the modern armies, published in 1929. In these two works, he elaborated his deep operations theory about the future warfare. The objective of a \\"deep operation\\" was to attack the enemy simultaneously throughout the depth of his ground force to induce a catastrophic failure in his defensive system. Highly mobile formations would then exploit this failure by breaking into the deep rear of the enemy and destroying his ability to rebuild his defenses. Vladimir Triandafillov was killed in an aircraft crash on 12 July 1931 and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. The quality of his work was realised late during World War II, when Georgy Zhukov said that his success was due to closely following Triandafillov's deep operations doctrine.

It is an organization made up of approximately 1,000 art librarians, library students and visual resource professionals. Activities ARLIS/NA organises activities such as: * annual conferences, * publishing articles through publications such as Art Documentation, occasional papers, and online publications, * providing a forum for professional communication, via listserv and a web site, * scholarship awards, * awards for research, service, and publication. History Before ARLIS/NA, art librarians organized under an American Library Association Round Table. However, ALA support was limited. Meetings were only held biannually, attendance was minimal, and professional progress slow. During the post-war years the world had opened up, and through the influence of popular magazines like Time (magazine) and Life (magazine), Americans were exposed to a range of cultures. According to Wolfgang Freitag, “Hundreds of new museums and libraries were built every year…there was an explosion of publications in the traditional formats on all subjects.”Freitag. W. M. (Fall 1997) ARLIS/NA at twenty-five: a reminiscence. Art Documentation v. 16 no. 2, p. 15-19. All of these developments led to the very real need for art librarians to organize. By the late 1960s, against ALA's wishes,Jacoby, T., et al. (Spring 2005). A Journey to Mr. Dewey's 700s: Speaking With Bill Dane. Art Documentation v. 24 no. 1 (Spring 2005) p. 42-9. a separate, short-lived art libraries group was created in conjunction with an existing museum sub-section of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of ALA. This proved to be temporary, too, as support was again limited. According to William J. Dane,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/nyregion/18library.html?scp=1&sq;=william+dane&st;=nyt \\"We didn't like being called a sub-section. We didn't need to depend on ALA or ACRL. There were enough of us who said, 'The hell with you.' Once the idea of independence got going, it was irreversible.\\" ARLIS/NA was founded in 1972 by art librarians attending the American Library Association annual conference in Chicago and was the brainchild of Judith Hoffberg, who had been inspired by attending meetings of ARLIS/UK in London. The informal annual meetings of art librarians with College Art Association furthered the initiative to organize. According to Wolfgang Freitag, “The Association of College and Research Libraries was but one of several library organizations in which art librarians were enrolled at that time.”Freitag, W. M. (Fall 1997). ARLIS/NA at twenty- five: a reminiscence. Art Documentation v. 16 no. 2, p. 15-19. By 1982 a major section of ARLIS/NA had broken off to form its own group, Visual Resources Association (VRA). The mission of the VRA is focused on media and image management, as well as progressing research and education in those areas. Wolfgang Freitag said \\"The growth of the two organizations has strengthened the profession as a whole so that it is stronger today than we could have imagined thirty and twenty years ago. It is a consolation that this happened even though, or perhaps because, the two main branches of what to my mind is still an indivisible profession gained their strength by following different paths and by marching to different drummers.\\"Freitag, W. M. (Fall 2003). Twenty years of estrangement, or what's in a name.

Club career Tressor Moreno began his career in the youth ranks of Colombia's Tuluá. In 1999, he emigrated to Peru and made his professional debut with Peruvian power Alianza Lima. While with Lima he appeared in 40 league matches and scored 16 goals, forming a formidable front line with Claudio Pizarro.http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/peru99.html During his time with Alianza Moreno was regarded as one of the best foreign players to have played in Peru.http://dechalaca.com/hemeroteca/el-once-ideal/once-ideal-bebieron-de- esta-copa The following season he returned to Colombia with Atlético Nacional and had another productive season appearing in 34 league matches and scoring 11 times and helping Nacional to capture the 2000 Copa Merconorte.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Alcantarilha e Pêra. With an area of the population of 2347 inhabitants (based on the 2001 census) is dispersed throughout the territory (there are 120 inhabitants per kilometre square of territory). History The territory of Silves has been occupied since the Paleolithic, and testaments of human presence in Alcantarilha can be traced back to the fossil beaches in Torre and Morgado das Relvas, along the coast. The first settlement in Alcantarilha, developed during the pre-Roman era. The primitive agglomeration concentrated around a defensible area at the end of the settlement. From the inventory by the Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate on Buildings and National Monuments), this settlement consisted of a Lusitanian castro bridging the Neolithic and Chalcolithic eras. This space was also a transit point for Phoenicians, Greek and Carthaginian traders. The name Alcantarilha appears to have its origin in Arab settlement/occupation, from the word al-quanTarâ, which meant bridge, viaduct or aqueduct, while the addition of the diminutive ilha implied a Roman or Mozarab influence, to indicate \\"small bridge\\". The former rail station of Alcantarilha-Armação de Pêra, hinting at Alcantarilha's history with its neighbouring parish During the Middle Ages, and beginning of the modern era, little is known about the activities of the communities of Alcantarilha, except for activities related with the defense of the Algarve coast and rare descriptions of the settlement in the 16th century. The oldest description came from 1573, and reflected by João Cascão, King Sebastian's personal chronicler, who accompanied the king through the Algarve to survey the defenses along the coast. The monarch had ordered the completion of the walls of Alcantarilha in 1571, which were part of a project began in the reign of John III. King Sebastian visited on 28 January 1573 for a short visit, to find the project completed. João Cascão left behind a historical account, on the small \\"hamlet\\" of Alcantarilha, that included 150 neighbours and completely encircled by a wall of bulwarks. For a while the civil parish oscillated between two parish seats: Pêra and Armação de Pêra. Until 1683, Pera (the parish seat) was linked to Alcantarilha, when bishop José de Menezes de-annexed the community, and included it in the municipality of Albufeira. Armação de Pêra, therefore, became the new parish seat until 1933, when Armação de Pêra also achieved territorial autonomy, and was de-annexed from Alcantarilha, to form its own parish. On 4 February 1999, PS deputy Jorge Valente (elected in the Algarve) brought before the National Assembly a petition to formally elevate the urban seat of Alcantarilha to the status of vila (town). This project was approved in plenary on 13 May 1999, and proclaimed on 1 November 1999.

The Arab Bureau was a section of the Cairo Intelligence Department established in 1916 during the First World War, and closed in 1920, whose purpose was the collection and dissemination of propaganda and intelligence about the Arab regions of the Middle East.Westrate, p.xii According to a Committee of Imperial Defence paper from 7 January 1916, the Arab Bureau was established to \\"harmonise British political activity in the Near East...[and] keep the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Committee of Defence, the War Office, the Admiralty, and Government of India simultaneously informed of the general tendency of Germano-Turkish Policy.\\"Committee of Defence Paper, \\"Establishment of an Arab Bureau in Cairo\\", 7 January 1916, FO882/2 ArB/16/4, quoted in Polly Mohs, Military Intelligence and the Arab Revolt (New York, 2008) p. 34. Brian Westrate wrote in his 1992 history of the Arab Bureau that \\"the agency has subsequently borne much of the blame for Britain's terrible mishandling of Middle Eastern policy during and shortly after World War I.\\"Westrate, p.xii History =Beginnings= It was constituted on the initiative of Mark Sykes who, in December 1915, reported to London that, in a recent tour of the Middle East from Egypt to India, he had discovered that the German and Turkish Governments were widely distributing anti-British wartime propaganda that countered British imperialism. Sykes was concerned because British command posts in the Middle East were generally uncooperative and thus far unable to produce counterpropaganda. Sykes proposed the creation of a London office under his auspices to gather, filter, and distribute intelligence on the German and Turkish Middle East policy and \\"co-ordinate propaganda in favour of Great Britain among non-Indian Moslems.\\"Memorandum by Sykes, 23 December 1915, British Foreign Office 882/2 ARB/15/4, fos 1-14. quoted in Polly Mohs, Military Intelligence and the Arab Revolt (New York, 2008), p. 33. =Support= Sykes' proposal was welcomed by Gilbert Clayton, the director of civilian and military intelligence in Egypt and Sudan. Clayton believed that such an office might not only discover and counter enemy propaganda but be capable of overseeing a wider collection of political and military information regarding the Middle East and in turn produce easily understood reports to inform policymaking in Cairo and London toward the Ottoman Arab territories.Polly Mohs, Military Intelligence in the Arab Revolt, (New York, 2008), p. 34. =Opposition= Clayton's preference for locating the Arab Bureau in Cairo met with resistance from the Indian Government (under the Viceroy Charles Hardinge) and the India Office (under the Secretary of State for India, Austen Chamberlain), who did not want interference in their control of territories around the Persian Gulf and particularly the Iraq provinces that they planned to occupy and cultivate for grain production for India. Newly discovered oil deposits located around the North Gulf brought further attention to the region. But the director of Naval Intelligence in Britain, Captain Reginald 'Blinker' Hall, supported Clayton's concept and urged government approval. =Establishment= The result was a compromise. In January 1916, the Arab Bureau was established as a section of Sudan Intelligence in Cairo, ultimately answering to the High Commissioner in Egypt (Henry McMahon) who in turn was overseen by the Foreign Office and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Edward Grey) in London. It was staffed by Middle East experts from military intelligence, Egypt Force who shared Clayton's outlook.Polly Mohs, Military Intelligence in the Arab Revolt, (New York, 2008), pp. 34–36. =Closure= Arnold Wilson later wrote that: > The Arab Bureau in Cairo died unregretted in 1920, having helped to induce > His Majesty's Government to adopt a policy which brought disaster to the > people of Syria, disillusionment to the Arabs of Palestine and ruin to the > Hijaz. Staff Gilbert Clayton was named head or \\"chief\\" of the Arab Bureau. David Hogarth, a naval intelligence officer, was acting director of the Arab Bureau and Kinahan Cornwallis his deputy. Herbert Garland, George Ambrose Lloyd, George Stewart Symes, Philip Graves, Gertrude Bell, Aubrey Herbert, William Ormsby-Gore, Thomas Edward Lawrence, Alfred Guillaume and Tracy Philipps were also part of the Arab Bureau. In 1920, Garland was appointed director, under High Commissioner to Egypt Lord Allenby.

Created without government approval, the Windcloud has nonetheless been the first step of Chery's success story and helped transform the Chinese automotive market from one dependent on foreign joint ventures. Development The A11 is essentially a rebadged first generation SEAT Toledo, a model which was built by SEAT – i.e. the Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen group – from 1991 to 1998 and was based on the Volkswagen Group A2 platform. This is the same platform used by FAW-VW Automobile for their successful, license-built FAW-VW Jetta. Windcloud production indeed depended on secret side deals with the same parts suppliers as did FAW-VW. A later financial settlement out of court meant that Volkswagen agreed to abstain from a planned lawsuit.Hessler, p. 65 The purchase of the Toledo blueprints was also executed in secret, in spite of SEAT being a Volkswagen subsidiary: all of these deft negotiations were the work of engineer Yin Tongyao, who had originally worked for Volkswagen's Chinese joint venture. Chery Windcloud Tongyao was originally poached by the government of Wuhu, in Anhui province, after they had reached the decision to develop a car for local production. Tongyao had also quietly purchased the production line for a rather outdated Ford engine (Ford 1.6 CVH) in England, which he then transferred to Anhui: the first engines left the production line in May 1999. This was to be the first engine installed in the Windcloud. It was later replaced by the more modern Tritec and Acteco engines. At the time, China had very strict regulations hindering the entry of new players into the automotive industry, so for nearly two years Chery was officially only producing \\"automotive components\\", albeit in a fully assembled form. In 2001, Chery finally received government permission to market their cars nationwide. The Chery A11's production began in December 1999 as the CAC6340. The name was changed to Fengyun, codenamed SQR7160, in 2000, and Chinese production ended in 2006. The Chery A15, first presented in 2003, is a facelifted Windcloud.

This building was built in 1911–12 in what was then the City of Strathcona at a cost of $35,000. The early twentieth century, two-storey, rectangular brick building is the oldest armoury in Alberta. Facilities In addition to a main floor drill hall, it incorporated storerooms for arms, saddles and uniforms; offices and a caretaker's apartment. In the basement, the drill hall had a rifle range and bowling alley. History The Edmonton Historical Board Plaque states:\\" Edmonton is home to several armoury buildings, reflecting the importance of the armed forces in our city's history. The Connaught Armoury was built in what was then the City of Strathcona in 1911-12. It was named for Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the third son of Queen Victoria and Canada's Governor-General from 1911 to 1916.\\" The armoury was built to house the B Squadron of the 19th Alberta Dragoons. The 19th Alberta Dragoons was a cavalry, and later armoured regiment which served during the First World War and in the Second World War. After the Second World War, it became the 19th Alberta Armoured Car Regiment. When the Dragoons were removed from the Order of Battle in 1964-5, the City of Edmonton acquired the armoury from the federal government. Legacy The building was vacant for 14 years. The building has been leased out to various restaurants over the years, but they did not succeed. The Strathcona Legion Branch 150 requested the use of the Armoury after the building they were occupying became too expensive to continue using. However, Edmonton City Council decided to use the building as a drop-in centre for the Youth Emergency Shelter Society.

Units can be next to each other (side-by-side units), or stacked on top of each other (top and bottom units). A common form is an apartment building. Many intentional communities incorporate multifamily residences, such as in cohousing projects. Sometimes units in a multifamily residential building are condominiums, where typically the units are owned individually rather than leased from a single apartment building owner. ExamplesApartment building or block of flats - a building with multiple apartments. There can be multiple apartments on each floor and there are often multiple floors. Apartment buildings can range in many sizes, some with only a few apartments, other with hundreds of apartments on many floors, or any size in between. There are often inside hallways and inside entrances to each apartment, but outside entrances to each apartment are also possible. An apartment building can be owned by one party and each of the apartments rented to tenants or each of the apartments can be owned as a condominium by separate parties. *Mixed use building - a building with space for both commercial, business, or office use, and space for residential use. Possible arrangements include the commercial/business use on the first or first couple floors and one or more apartments or residential spaces on the upper floors. Another possibility is to have the commercial/business area up front and the residential area in the back. Some or maybe all of the space may be used by the owner or some or all the business and residential units may be leased by the owner. Condominium ownership is also possible. *Apartment community - a collection of apartment buildings on adjoining pieces of land, generally owned by one entity. The buildings often share common grounds and amenities, such as pools, parking areas, and a community clubhouse, used as leasing offices for the community. * Brownstone: a New York City term for a rowhouse: see rowhouse. * Bedsit: a British expression (short for bed-sitting room) for a single-roomed dwelling in a sub-divided larger house. The standard type contains a kitchenette or basic cooking facilities in a combined bedroom/living area, with a separate bathroom and lavatory shared between a number of rooms. Once common in older Victorian properties in British cities, they are less frequently found since the 1980s as a result of tenancy reforms, property prices and renovation grants that favour the refurbishment of such properties into self-contained flats for leasehold sale. * Close: Term used in Glasgow for high density slum housing built 1800-1870. Tenements usually 3 or 4 stories, terraced, back-to-back, around a short cul-de-sac. * Cluster house: an older form of the Q-type house (see below) * Condominium: a form of ownership with individual apartments for everyone, and co-ownership (by percentages) of all of the common areas, such as corridors, hallways, stairways, lobbies, recreation rooms, porches, rooftops, and any outdoor areas of the grounds of the buildings. Townhouses and apartments which are owned in the condominium form of ownership are often referred to as \\"condominiums\\" or \\"condos.\\" * Court: high density slum housing built in the UK, 1800-1870. Two or more stories, terraced, back-to-back, around a short alley at right angles to the main street. Once common in cities like Liverpool and Leeds. * Deck access: a block of \\"flats\\" which are accessed from a walkway that is open to the elements. * Dingbat (apartment building style) * Duplex (American English), Two-flat (British English) - a building commonly built on an edgeyard lot, consisting either of two residences, one to a storey, or a pair of semi-detached dwellings of one or several stories each. Common spaces shared by both residences may include a basement, foyer, stairwell, or porch. * Flat: In Great Britain and parts of Ireland, this means exactly the same as an \\"apartment\\". In and around San Francisco, CA, this term means an apartment that takes up an entire floor of a large house, usually one that has been converted from an older Victorian house. In Ireland, the use of the term \\"flat\\" generally implies an apartment which is smaller or of lesser value, while the term apartment is used for larger privately owned dwellings. * 2-Flat, 3-Flat, and 4-Flat houses: houses or buildings with 2, 3, or 4 flats, respectively, especially when each of the flats takes up one entire floor of the house. There is a common stairway in the front and often in the back providing access to all the flats. 2-Flats and sometimes 3-flats are common in certain older neighborhoods. * Four Plus One: an apartment building consisting of four stories above a parking lot. The four floors containing the apartment units are of wood-frame and masonry construction. It was particularly popular in Chicago during the 1960s and 1970s, especially on the city's north side. * Garage-apartment: an apartment over a garage; if the garage is attached, the apartment will have a separate entrance from the main house. * Garlow: a portmanteau word \\"garage\\" + \\"bungalow\\"; similar to a garage-apartment, but with the apartment and garage at the same level. * Garden apartment: a building style usually characterized by two story, semi-detached buildings, each floor being a separate apartment. * Garden flat: a flat which is at garden (ground) level in a multilevel house or apartment building, especially in the case of Georgian and Victorian terraced housing which has been sub- divided into separate dwellings. * Housing cooperative (or Co-op): a form of ownership in which a non-profit corporation owns the entire apartment building or development and residents own shares in the corporation that correspond to their apartment and a percentage of common areas. In Australia this corresponds with a \\"company title\\" apartment. * Loft or warehouse conversion can be an apartment building wherein part of the unit, usually consisting of the bedroom(s) and/or a second bedroom level bath is sub-divided vertically within the structurally tall bay between the structural floors of a former factory or warehouse building. The lofts created in such are locally supported by columns and bearing walls and not part of the overall original load bearing structure. * Maisonette: an apartment / flat on two levels with internal stairs, or which has its own entrance at street level. * Mess: a building or flat with single bedroom per tenant and shared facilities like toilets and kitchens. These are popular with students, bachelors or low wage earners in the Indian subcontinent. It is similar to the bedsit in the UK. Some variants include multiple tenants per bedroom and inclusion of a centralized maid service or cooked meals with tenancy. * Mother-in-law apartment: small apartment either at the back, in the basement, or on an upper level subdivision of the main house, usually with a separate entrance (also known as a \\"Granny flat\\" in the UK, Australia New Zealand and South Africa). If it is a separate structure from the main house, it is called a 'granny cottage' or a 'doddy house'. Such Secondary suites are often efficiency or two room apartments but always have kitchen facilities (which is usually a legal requirement of any apartment). *Microapartment: rather common in the same countries where microhouses (above) are popular. These small single-room dwellings contain a kitchen, a bathroom, a sleeping area, etc., in one place, usually in a multistorey building. * Officetel: small apartment providing a combined work and living area in one place, especially in South Korea. * One- plus-five: a mid-rise apartment or condominium building consisting of four or five wood-framed floors above a concrete podium. This type of construction exploded in popularity in North American cities in the 2010s. * Penthouse: the top floor of multi-story building * Plattenbau (East German) / Panelák (Czech, Slovak): a communist-era tower block that is made of slabs of concrete put together. * Q-type: townhouse built mainly in housing estates in the UK beginning in the late 20th century. The houses are arranged in blocks of four with each house at a corner of the block. Similar to the earlier cluster house (see above). * Railroad apartment (or railroad flat): a type of apartment in which rooms are directly linked, without hallway separation, similar to a line of railroad cars. * Rooming house: a type of Single Room Occupancy building where most washing, kitchen and laundry facilities are shared between residents, which may also share a common suite of living rooms and dining room, with or without board arrangements. When board is provided (no longer common), a common dining time and schedule is imposed by the landlord who in such cases also serves as an innkeeper of sorts. In Australia and the United States, any housing accommodation with 4 or more bedrooms can be regarded as a rooming house if each bedroom is subject to individual tenancy agreements. In the U.S., rooming house lease agreements typically run for very short periods, usually week to week, or a few days at a time. Transient housing arrangements for longer term tenancies are implemented by a \\"rider\\" on a case by case basis, if local laws permit. * Rowhouse (USA); also called \\"Terraced home\\" (USA); also called \\"Townhouse\\": 3 or more houses in a row sharing a \\"party\\" wall with its adjacent neighbour. In New York City, \\"Brownstones\\" are rowhouses. Rowhouses are typically multiple stories. The term townhouse is currently coming into wider use in the UK, but terraced house (not \\"terraced home\\") is more common. * Shophouse: the name given in Southeast Asia to a terraced two to five story urban building featuring a shop or other public activity on the street level, with residential accommodation on upper floors. * Single Room Occupancy or SRO: a studio apartment, usually occurring with a block of many similar apartments, intended for use as public housing. They may or may not have their own washing, laundry, and kitchen facilities. In the United States, lack of kitchen facilities prevents use of the term \\"apartment\\", so such would be classified as a boarding house or hotel. * Six- pack: in New England (USA), this refers to a stick-built block of 6 apartments comprising (duplexed) two three story Triple deckers built side by side sharing one wall, a common roof, lot, yards (lawns and gardens, if any), parking arrangements, and basement, but possessing separately metered electric, and separate hot water and heating or air conditioning. In Australia, it refers to a style of apartments that were constructed during the 1960s, 70s and early 80s, usually comprising a single, masonry-built block containing 4 to 8 walk-up apartments (though sometimes, many more), of between 2 and 3 stories in height, with car parking at the side or rear. *Semi- detached - one building consisting of two separate \\"houses\\", typically side by side, each with separate entrances and typically without common inside areas. Each of the two houses typically has separate owners. * Studio apartment or Studio flat (UK), or Bachelor apartment or Efficiency apartment: a suite with a single room that doubles as living/sitting room and bedroom, with a kitchenette and bath squeezed in off to one side. The unit is designed for a single occupant or possibly a couple. Especially in Canada and South Africa, also called bachelor, or bachelorette if very small. * Tenement: a multi-unit dwelling usually of frame construction, quite often brick veneered, made up of several (generally many more than four to six) apartments (i.e. a large apartment building) that can be up to five stories. Tenements do not generally have elevators. In the United States the connotation sometimes implies a run- down or poorly cared-for building. It often refers to a very large apartment building usually constructed during the late 19th to early 20th century era sited in cities or company towns. Victorian terrace in Moss Side, Manchester, UK. * Terraced house: since the late 18th century is a style of housing where (generally) identical individual houses are conjoined into rows - a line of houses which abut directly on to each other built with shared party walls between dwellings whose uniform fronts and uniform height created an ensemble that was more stylish than a \\"rowhouse\\". However this is also the UK term for a \\"rowhouse\\" regardless of whether the houses are identical or not.  Back- to-back: terraced houses which also adjoin a second terrace to the rear. They were a common form of housing for workers during the Industrial Revolution in England. * Tower block or Apartment tower: a high-rise apartment building. * Townhouse: also called Rowhouse (US). In the UK, a townhouse is a traditional term for an upper-class house in London (in contrast with country house), and is now coming into use as a term for new terraced houses, which are often three or more stories tall and may include a garage on the ground floor.  Stacked townhouse: units are stacked on each other; units may be multilevel; all units have direct access from the outside. * Three family home or Three family house: U.S. real estate and advertising term for several configurations of apartment classed dwelling buildings including:  Triple decker: a three- family apartment house, usually of frame construction, in which all three apartment units are stacked on top of one another. (For additional characteristics, also see Multifamily home features below.) * Triplex (American English), Three-flat (British English) - a building similar to a duplex except there are three stories. Two-flat and possibly three-flat buildings are rather common in certain older neighborhoods in certain cities. *Townhouse - a house attached to any number of other townhouses each of which may have multiple floors, commonly side by side each with their own separate entrances. Each such house has its own owner. * Two decker: a two family house consisting of stacked apartments that frequently have similar or identical floor plans. Some two deckers, usually ones starting as single-family homes, have one or both floors sub-divided and are therefore three or four-family dwellings. Some have external stairways giving a totally separate entrance, and some, usually those which have been a single-family house now sub-divided, are similar to the Maisonette plan but sharing a common external 'main entrance' door and lock, and a main internal hall with stairways letting to the separate apartments. (For additional characteristics, also see Multifamily home features below.) * Tyneside flat: a pair of single-storey flats in a two- storey terrace, distinctively with two separate front doors to the street rather than a shared lobby. Notably found on Tyneside, North Eastern England. * Quadplex (American English), Four-flat (British English) - a building similar to a three-flat except there are four flats. In some cases, the arrangement of apartments may be different and the lot size may be larger than that of a regular house. * Tong Lau(唐樓 / 騎樓): a type of shophouse found in southern China and old parts of Hong Kong. It has shops on the first floor, no basement, no garage and about 3-4 floors. It had to be short for the Tong Laus in Hong Kong is very close to the old Kai Tak airport, but it is now a cruise terminal and newer and higher buildings have sprung up there. The government has also been destroying the old Tong Laus and rebuilding. * \\"Toothpick Apartments\\": a type of apartment about 10-20 stories high and usually has one flat on each story. It is very thin, and surrounded by many other shorter buildings (Tong Lau), therefore nicknamed \\"Toothpick Apartments\\". They exist in Hong Kong, and are mostly private apartments. They have about 1-3 levels of car parks. * Unit: a type of Medium-density housing found in Australia and New Zealand. * Vatara: a housing complex, mainly found in urban Karnataka, India, similar to an apartment complex, but with mostly two stories and homes in a row on each floor.

I would press a thousand CDs, we'd get 'em in stores...get in a local independent radio station and the band would have something to sell at shows and then hopefully a real label would pick it up. It got a lot busier than I ever imagined...in the end it just went out of control...I never expected it to be a real label. I'm re-pressing thousands and... 'Shit, I'm...gonna have to do this correctly, people's livelihoods (are) resting in my hands.'...I ended up cracking under the pressure, especially just getting those bands on a real label...That's always been my calling, spreading the bands I liked that people hadn't heard.\\" With reference to the label's relaunch he added, \\"Now I've just heard that call again...a lot of artists are unheard that I think I can try to help with.\\"Simon Harper, \\"Band of Horses interview\\" Clash - May 19, 2010 Personal life Bridwell married Elizabeth McCann on April 4, 2009.

In 1970, it became a hit by Santana, as sung by Gregg Rolie, reaching No. 4 in the US and Canadian charts, after appearing on their Abraxas album. The song was also covered by erstwhile Fleetwood Mac member Bob Welch on his 2006 album His Fleetwood Mac Years and Beyond, Vol. 2. Although Welch was not a member of the group at the time of the original recording, he had performed a number of Peter Green's songs during his time with them. Fleetwood Mac version In various interviews, Peter Green has acknowledged that \\"Black Magic Woman\\" was influenced by \\"All Your Love\\", an Otis Rush song that had been recorded two years earlier by Green's former band, John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers (albeit with Eric Clapton, Green's predecessor, on lead guitar). Although not as popular as Santana's arrangement two years later, \\"Black Magic Woman\\" nevertheless became a fairly popular blues rock hit peaking at No. 37 in the UK Singles Chart. It was featured in Fleetwood Mac live set-lists even after Green had left the band when it was often sung by Danny Kirwan, and during concerts in the early 1970s it would form the basis for long mid-concert jams. The song has the same chord structure, guitar breaks, and even a similar melody to Green's “I Loved Another Woman” from the band's 1968 debut album, and may have evolved out of the earlier song. =Structure= Set in the key of D minor, the verse follows a twelve bar chord progression alternating between D minor7, A minor7, and G minor7, and the instrumentation consists of vocals, two guitars, bass guitar and drums. It is homophonic, the voice and lead guitar taking the lead roles. The song is set in common time (4/4), with the rhythm \\"pushing\\" on the upbeat, then breaking into a shuffle beat root -chord jam after the final verse. D minor 7  D minor 7  A minor 7  A minor 7  D minor 7  D minor 7  G minor 7  G minor 7  Dm 7 \\\\- C 7  Bb 7 \\\\- A 7  D minor 7  D minor 7 The original recording by Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featured guitars that were slightly below standard pitch. For most performances, it is played in standard. The D minor triad from the 17 fret is played out on one guitar, and a slide guitar playing the same chord is faded in over the top. Santana version =Background= Santana's version, recorded in 1970, is a medley with Gábor Szabó's 1966 instrumental \\"Gypsy Queen\\", a mix of jazz, Hungarian folk and Latin rhythms. The song became one of Santana's staples and one of their biggest hits, with the single reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1971, their highest-peaking Hot 100 hit until 1999’s \\"Smooth\\". Abraxas reached number one on the charts and hit quadruple platinum in 1986, partially thanks to \\"Black Magic Woman\\". \\"Gypsy Queen\\" was omitted from 1974's Santana's Greatest Hits album, even though radio stations usually play \\"Black Magic Woman\\" and \\"Gypsy Queen\\" as one song. =Structure= While the song follows the same general structure of Peter Green's version, also set in common time, in D minor and using the same melody and lyrics, it is considerably different, with a slightly altered chord pattern (Dm7– Am7–Dm7–Gm7–Dm7–Am7–Dm7), occasionally mixing between the Dorian and Aeolian modes, especially in the song's intro. A curious blend of blues, rock, jazz, 3/2 afro-Cuban son clave, and \\"Latin\\" polyrhythms, Santana's arrangement added conga, timbales and other percussion, in addition to organ and piano, to make complex polyrhythms that give the song a \\"voodoo\\" feel distinct from the original. The introduction of the song, which was adapted from Szabó's \\"Gypsy Queen\\", consists of simple hammer-ons, pull-offs and slides on the guitar and bass, before moving into the introductory guitar solo of \\"Black Magic Woman.\\" After the introductory solo, which follows the same chord progression as the verse, the song moves into an eight-bar piano solo in D minor, and proceeds to two verses sung by keyboardist Gregg Rolie. Two verses of guitar solo follow the two sung verses, which are then succeeded by another verse, before moving into a modified version of the \\"Gypsy Queen\\" section from the beginning of the song to end the piece. There is also a single edit that runs for 3:15. On some radio versions, the piano solo is omitted, and \\"Gypsy Queen\\" is sometimes omitted. Other longer versions have since been released, including one which runs for 8:56.

Page High School (commonly referred to as Page High or PHS) is a public high school in Franklin, Tennessee, United States. The school serves the eastern section of Williamson County for students in grades 9–12. The school is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and bears the name of former Williamson County Schools Superintendent Frederick Jackson Page. Frederick Jackson Page Page High School was named after Frederick Jackson Page (1863–1944), the first Superintendent of Williamson County Schools. He served in that position for 42 years (1899–1941) retiring at the age of 77. Superintendent Page gained a reputation nationally as a revolutionary educator, scholar and author. He was instrumental in the county's expansion from 8 grades to 12 grades in the early 1900s, lengthened the school year from five months to nine months, and introduced the ideas of summer school for remediation purposes and increased rigor in elementary school. Page revolutionized the teacher certification process and introduced the idea of uniform textbooks to replace teacher-made materials, additionally consolidating hundreds of tiny schoolhouses into larger, centralized institutions. Page retired in 1941 and died on April 9, 1944.  Administration  Shane Pantall is the principal of Page High. The school has three assistant principals: Kelly Ferguson, Randy Hatley, and Katie Hill. History Fred J. Page School was completed in 1975 on 40 acres of Tennessee farmland at a cost of $3 million. Built in the unincorporated town of Rudderville and serving grades 7-12, the school was posthumously named for Frederick Page 31 years after his death. The building was designed by architect Earl Swensson, an architect who also designed the Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville, TN. L.L. Poe Construction Company served as contractor on the project just seven years after completing the Keathley University Center on the campus of Middle Tennessee State University. The new school was constructed to remove and consolidate the upper grades of Bethesda and College Grove, two K-12 schools that were bitter rivals. Bethesda, College Grove and Nolensville subsequently became K-6 schools while Page would serve grades 7-12. Built to serve the eastern section of Williamson County with a capacity of 1000 students, Page High School's initial enrollment was around 850. The inaugural faculty included principal Bob Greathouse, assistant principal Mayes Waters, two guidance counselors, one librarian and 36 teachers. In 2000, Page High School marked its 25th anniversary with nine of the original 36 teachers still employed. As of 2016-17, Jimmy Baker is the only active teacher from the original faculty. The original school building included 34 classrooms, but an expansion in the 1990s increased that number to current total of 54 classrooms with an expanded capacity for 1215 students. In 1981, Fred J. Page Middle School opened across the street at which point the original Fred J. Page became a high school exclusively serving grades 9-12. In 1985, several scenes of the critically acclaimed movie At Close Range were filmed on location at the entrance of Fred J. Page High School. The movie was released in 1986 boasting an all-star cast including Sean Penn and Christopher Walken and Page High students were used as extras. Until 2004, the Page High School zone included the towns of Thompson's Station and the northern half of Spring Hill. However, throughout that decade the area became the fastest growing population in the United States swelling to over 276% growth. The initial population explosion was attributed to the opening of the Saturn Corporation automobile plant in Spring Hill. At one point 20% of the students at Page High School were Michigan natives, most of whom were families relocated from the Midwest by Saturn's parent company General Motors. Following the construction of Independence High School and most recently Summit High School, Page no longer serves the Thompson's Station and Spring Hill areas of the county. Page High School has the smallest capacity of all nine traditional high schools in Williamson County. In 2016, the district began planning for campus improvements at Page middle and high schools. The proposed multi-phase plan was released in February 2017 and would add classrooms, expand common areas like the cafeteria and media center, improve athletic facilities, and create additional parking. The first phase of this plan was approved at a county commission meeting in October 2017. Academics and testing During the 2013-14 school year, Page High School in Williamson County and Farragut High School in Knox County were the only two high schools in Tennessee that ranked among the top 5% in academic performance and the top 5% in academic progress. At the conclusion of the 2013–14 school year, Page High was awarded Platinum High Achievement status for the fourth consecutive year through the National High Schools That Work initiative of the Southern Regional Education Board. The school is among only a few schools in Tennessee bestowed National Blue Ribbon status and was one of three high school finalists for the 2011 SCORE prize after demonstrating tremendous academic gains. In 2013, Dr. Andrea Anthony was named the Tennessee High School Principal of the Year by the National Association of Secondary School Principals. During the 2014-15 school year, The Daily Beast website ranked Page High School the top school in Williamson County, the second best school in Tennessee, and 59th best in America (based on college acceptance rates, AP course enrollment, college entrance exam scores and college preparedness among other criteria). During the same school year, U.S. News & World Report named Page High School Tennessee's top-ranked public school zone in both mathematics and English proficiency for the fifth consecutive year, Tennessee's only school zone to surpass 90% proficiency in mathematics (93%), and the only school zone to surpass 90% proficiency in English (95%). The website Schooldigger.com named Page High the top secondary school in the state while Newsweek named the school zone the second best academically in Tennessee with the 7th highest average SAT score in the United States. An independent study ranked the AP Calculus program the strongest in the state of Tennessee among zoned public schools. From 2010 to 2015, the school was ranked among America's top 500 high schools and the best school zone in Tennessee by Newsweek magazine and U.S. News & World Report; however, during the 2015-16 school year Page High School dropped out of the top 1000 schools. The class of 2016 had an average ACT score of 22.4, higher than the state average of 19.8 and national average of 21. The school offers 21 Advanced Placement course several career and technical education courses including veterinary science, architecture, AV production, computer science, marketing, nursing, and engineering. The class of 2018 had an average ACT score of 24.  Arts  Page offers visual art, instrumental music, and theatre classes. The marching band has won the Division II State Marching Band Championships from 2004–2010 and from 2014–2015. Despite its name, the yearly competition is not sanctioned by any statewide band organization and is not considered an official state championship. The band has also been named a finalist at Bands of America regional championships and a semifinalist at the BOA Grand National Championships.

Before her completion, she was loaned to the Royal Hellenic Navy on 20 July 1942 and commissioned as Adrias on 5 August 1942 in order to relieve heavy losses of ships sustained by the Royal Hellenic Navy during the German invasion of 1941 and throughout the war.Griechische Schiffsverluste, Das Historische Marinearchiv Adrias took her name from the ancient Greek town of Adria in Italy, at the mouth of the Po river, after which the Adriatic Sea is named (Herodotus vi. 127, vii. 20, ix. 92; Euripides, Hippolytus, 736). Command of Adrias was accepted by Cmdr. Ioannis Toumbas in Newcastle, England, on 20 July 1942. Upon completion of the training period on 26 August, while sailing under foggy conditions with only the left engine functioning, she ran aground near Scapa Flow. The damage took four months to repair. No responsibility was attributed to the captain for the accident. In the beginning of January, 1943, after the completion of repairs, Adrias sailed to the Mediterranean where she participated in missions escorting convoys. Service On 27 January 1943, while positioned NW off Cape Finisterre Adrias was believed to have sunk the (British Admiralty's signal presumed her possibly sunk). When the war ended the loss of the German submarine was officially confirmed to have occurred on 27 January. However, the name of the ship that caused the sinking was not mentioned. During that same operation on 13 February 1943, Adrias sunk or seriously damaged (the last report from that submarine was dated 9 February 1943). Adrias took part in numerous convoy escorts in the Mediterranean as well as in the Sicily landing operations, where on the night of 20 July 1943, in cooperation with British escort destroyer she successfully confronted 3 German torpedo boats during a night engagement and sunk two of them. On 20 September 1943 Adrias represented Greece when a force of four Allied ships accepted the surrender of a contingent of the Italian Royal Navy (out of Taranto) that was sailing towards Malta following the armistice with Italy. Adrias at Alexandria harbour, 6 December 1943 On 22 October 1943, during operations in the Dodecanese, while near the island of Kalymnos with the British destroyer , Adrias struck a mine. The explosion tore her bow off. The English Flotilla Commander onboard Hurworth ordered Cmdr. Toumbas to abandon ship. Hurworth, while trying to come to Adriass rescue, also hit a mine and sunk taking 143 men with her. In spite of the damage suffered, Adrias took on the survivors of Hurworth (among them her CO) and managed to reach the nearby coast of Gümüşlük in neutral Turkey with 21 men of her crew dead and 30 wounded. After some minor repairs, the ship sailed on 1 December for Alexandria, despite her missing bow. After a trip of , of which 300 were within the range of Luftwaffe's Junkers Ju 88 bombers based in occupied Greece, (the threat of them forced her to sail only at night despite her limited maneuverability), she managed to reach Alexandria on 6 December (day of the Feast of St. Nicholas, patron saint of seamen) where she was enthusiastically greeted by the British Fleet and other Allied ships. This achievement was considered a brilliant example of seamanship, and provided a morale boost to the Royal Hellenic Navy and other allied ships in the Mediterranean. After the liberation of Greece from the Germans, Adrias, with her bow temporarily repaired, arrived in Faliro with the rest of the ships of the Hellenic Fleet. The ship was never fully repaired due to the termination of war operations in the Mediterranean and sailed to England where she was returned to the Royal Navy. Of the same class of ships serving in the Hellenic Navy were: Adrias (D06) formerly (loaned to Hellenic Navy as a replacement of this ship), Hastings formerly loaned to Hellenic Navy in 1946, Kanaris built as , Miaoulis built as , Pindos built as . The Hellenic Navy gave the same name to commemorate this ship to Standard type frigate Adrias (F-459) in 1994.

Depending on the type and size of band, the guitar tech may be responsible for stringing, tuning, and adjusting electric guitars and acoustic guitars, and maintaining and setting up guitar amplifiers and other related electronic equipment such as effect pedals. Once the guitar equipment has been set up onstage, the guitar tech does a soundcheck to ensure that the equipment is working well. If there are any problems, the guitar tech replaces or repairs the faulty components or equipment. Since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have basic guitar-playing skills, a musical \\"ear\\" for tuning, and a familiarity with the way guitars, amplifiers, and effect pedals are supposed to sound in the style of music of their band. Guitar techs learn their craft either \\"on the job\\", by working in a range of music, sound engineering, and instrument repair jobs; by completing a guitar repair program at a college or lutherie school; or from a combination of these two routes. The salaries and conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely, depending on whether a guitar tech is working for a minor or regional touring bar band or a major international touring act. Duties =Setting up and soundchecking= Photo of Billy Corgan's guitar rig taken by his guitar tech during one of the Smashing Pumpkins' live shows. The duties of a guitar technician depend on the type of band they are working for, and on a range of other factors such as the size and nature of the stage show and the length of the show. Guitar technicians who work for an acoustic band, such as a folk group or bluegrass ensemble may be responsible for setting up and stringing, and tuning a range of stringed, fretted instruments including acoustic guitars, dobros, and mandolins. A guitar tech for a heavy metal band, on the other hand, may focus mainly on electric guitars, guitar amplifiers, and effects pedals. A guitar tech may change the sequence of effects pedals or alter the settings on effects pedals during the show, to assist the guitarist in creating different tone colours or sounds. For example, a guitarist may ask the guitar tech to connect a chorus effect and reverb before a guitar solo. In an indie rock band, a guitar technician would likely configure the equipment to evoke through tone a modern yet historically evocative sound. In an acid rock band, a guitar tech might have to manipulate the controls on a ring modulator or a rotating Leslie speaker cabinet to create unusual sounds while the guitarist is performing. Acoustic guitars being tuned up backstage before a concert; note the tiny electronic tuner clipped to the headstock of the guitar on the left. Once the guitars have been tuned with an electronic tuner and strummed to ensure that they are in tune, the guitar tech usually sets up the different guitars on guitar racks, ensures that the leather or nylon straps are properly connected, and that the patch cords are plugged in properly. During the show, the guitar tech hands instruments to the guitarist or guitarists according to the types of guitar that are required in the songs that they are playing. For example, a hard rock guitarist may use a \\"flying-V\\" guitar for a fast song, and then switch to an acoustic 12-string guitar for a soft ballad. The guitar tech retunes all of the instruments before they are used, because even if an instrument was perfectly in tune during the soundcheck, the heat from stage lights and the humidity from the stage conditions may render the instrument slightly out of tune. After each guitar is used, the guitar tech cleans the strings with a cloth and replaces the instrument on a rack. During the show, the tech stands ready to replace any guitars in case a string breaks or if there is an equipment malfunction. The guitar tech may hand fresh towels to the guitarist so that the guitarist can remove sweat from the hands and ensure that the guitarist has ready access to bottles of cool water or other wet beverages. If a guitar technician is working for a guitarist who uses picks, the guitar tech may lay out a variety of picks on a guitar amplifier or tape the picks to the mic stands with double-sided tape, so that they are within easy reach. At the end of the show, the guitar tech disconnects all of the patch cords, cleans the instruments and puts them back into their cases. =Maintenance and repair= The guitar tech also might perform any of a variety of maintenance tasks, such as checking that the string height of the guitars is set properly, modifying (\\"dressing\\") the height and arc of the frets, adjusting the intonation of the instruments, checking that tubes (valves) on tube amplifiers are working properly, and that cables are in good condition and free from crackles and hum caused by nicks and abrasions in the shielding or cable insulation. Techs also check the batteries on \\"outboard\\" devices — effects boxes, tuners, and pre-amps — and wireless transmitters, and change them as necessary. Depending on the size of a band's road crew, the guitar tech may either do this maintenance him- or herself, or, in a large touring act, delegate tasks to more-junior personnel. The guitar tech does a basic soundcheck with the different guitars, amplifiers, and effects, to ensure that the equipment is functioning properly and that all of the connections between the equipment (which are made with patch cords) are plugged in correctly. This may be as simple as plugging an electric guitar into an amplifier or plugging an acoustic guitar into a DI box and preamp/equalizer. On the other hand, a tech may have to set up ten or more electric guitars, a variety of amplifiers, and connect them to an intricate sequence of effects pedals. When all of the instruments and equipment are set up and soundchecked, if there are problems — crackles, hum, no signal from the guitar, no sound from an amplifier — the tech may have responsibility for troubleshooting to determine the cause or causes. Common problems include damaged patch cords, ground loops in connection between instruments and amplifiers, weak batteries in effects boxes or on-board preamps, bad vacuum tubes in tube amplifiers or overdrive effects, broken electrical connectors or solder joints, speaker voice coils damaged from the previous concert, or equipment damaged during transport. Tuning problems may come from old or dirty strings, damaged or worn machine heads or frets, or mis-adjusted bridges. A guitar tech is often a \\"jack of all trades,\\" expected to make simple repairs: resolder a loose wiring connection inside a guitar, replace an amplifier tube, swap out a damaged speaker for a new one, reglue a loose part on an acoustic guitar, or adjust a truss rod. In cases where there is either not enough time to make the repair, or if the equipment is damaged beyond repair, the guitar tech is may be responsible for finding a replacement instrument or part, either by purchasing or renting it from a local music store or by borrowing it from another band. While another member of the road crew may be dispatched to pick up an item, the tech usually writes down which models or brands are acceptable replacements. On rare occasions, guitar technicians may be asked to fill in for the guitarist they are teching for. Conditions of work The conditions of work for guitar techs vary widely. Some guitar techs for small touring acts may set up guitars for all of the stringed-instrument performers—rhythm guitar, lead guitar, bass, and so on; they may even take on a large variety of tasks beyond guitar tech work, such as helping to set up sound equipment or soundcheck the microphones. On the other hand, guitar techs for major touring bands may be part of a large road crew team that includes amplifier technicians, guitar technicians for each guitarist (rhythm guitarist and lead guitarist), and a variety of people who set up the stage equipment. In a major touring band, a guitar tech's duties might be more narrowly circumscribed. They might only have to set up the guitars for a single performer, and there might be other staff who set up and maintain the amplifiers, effects, and guitar stands, and electronics technicians who solder and repair connections and wiring. The salary, benefits, and accommodations of guitar techs vary widely. The first jobs that a guitar tech does may be on a volunteer basis in a garage band or amateur group, to gain experience, or alternatively the guitar tech might work in return for a small cash payment that is more of a symbolic honorarium than a real salary. In regional-level bar bands or minor touring acts, the guitar techs may be paid on a contractual basis during the weeks or months that the group is on tour, and there may not be health or dental benefits. A guitar tech working for this type of band must find other work to fill in months when the band is not on tour. On the other hand, a major touring act may hire a guitar technician as a permanent employee and provide them with a range of benefits. Accommodations depend on conditions set out in the contract, and the level and status of the group. A guitar tech traveling with a regional-level band may stay in inexpensive motels and receive a modest per diem for restaurant meals. A guitar tech traveling with a major touring band, however, may stay at the same first-class hotels as the star performers and eat catered buffet or restaurant meals. Some bands with substantial road crews may have their own catering crew. Guitar techs for the most famous international guitarists such as Jimmy Page or Tony Iommi can become minor celebrities within the guitar fan community because of their proximity to famous musicians and insider knowledge of how a certain guitarist's unique tone is created. Training and career path Guitar technicians must have a broad knowledge of the musical equipment used in the types of bands they work with. At a minimum, this must consist of familiarity with setting up and tuning guitars and making simple adjustments and repairs. As well, guitar techs are often expected to set up, repair, and adjust electronic effects, tuners, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, and pedalboards. To do these tasks, guitar techs must know about a range of audio engineering and electronics concepts—such as impedance, signal phase (for speakers and microphone wiring), and input voltage for pre-amps and effects. To do simple repairs on electronic gear, a guitar tech may have to know how to use a soldering iron and a multitester, and how to do basic electronics troubleshooting. As well, since guitar techs need to soundcheck the instruments and amplifiers, they must have a knowledge of the way guitars and amplifiers are supposed to sound in the style of music of the band. This means that the guitar tech must have an ear for music, and for musical tones and sounds. A guitar tech for a heavy metal band must be able to tell whether distortion from a heavily over-driven tube amp is desirable tube clipping or distortion from a blown speaker or damaged power amp. The distinctions a guitar tech must make can be subtle. For example, a guitar tech replacing a blown tube with a new one may have to ensure that the tube amplifier still has the same \\"color\\" or \\"warmth\\" when chords are played through it. To check guitar tuning, a guitar tech must be able to play major, minor, and other chords in a variety of keys. Even if the guitar has been tuned with an electronic tuner, the tuning still must be checked by ear, because the equal tempered tuning of a guitar can involve compromise. Guitar tuning can be affected by fret placement and wear, the angle of bridge angle, string age, and other factors. Thus, even if an electronic tuner indicates that a guitar is 100% \\"in tune,\\" it may still need minor adjustments which are made by ear. The training of guitar technicians varies widely. Some guitar technicians have studied music, guitar repair, amplifier maintenance, or electronics repair in college or university. On the other hand, some techs learned these skills informally on the job, or by working their way up through the ranks in a range of musical jobs, from a roadie and sound engineer to a sideman in a bar band. Guitar techs trained on the job may learn their skills by playing in amateur or semi-professional bands as a guitarist or bassist, working for music stores as a guitar repairperson, for clubs or bars as a sound engineer, or by maintaining equipment for PA system rental companies. A typical career path for becoming a guitar technician via on the job training is to begin by volunteering in a bar band and then working for low wages in a regional touring act or a minor touring act. As they gain experience and add skills, they may seek out better-paying jobs with higher-status touring bands. Once a guitar technician has joined the road crew of a major touring act, they may seek out promotions within this organization, to jobs with greater responsibilities and higher pay. For example, a guitar tech who works as an assistant technician could try to get promoted to a guitar technician for the lead guitarist. A guitar tech who completes a guitar repair program at a college or lutherie school may be able to enter midway up the guitar tech career ladder. In the early part of a guitar tech's career, there might be a great deal of mobility between different types of bands and technician roles. While working for minor or regional acts, a guitar tech may be able to work for a country rock bar band and then immediately switch to being the bass tech for a hard rock tribute band, because the tasks are fairly uniform. Career mobility of guitar technicians tends to become more constrained, though, when guitar techs begin to get jobs with high-status professional touring acts from specific genres. When a regional bar band looks for a guitar tech for a summer nightclub tour, there may many guitar techs who could meet the skill requirements. However, if an internationally known 1960s-style acid rock touring act with a celebrity lead guitarist goes on a major tour, there may be only a handful of guitar techs who have the unique combination of skills for this position.(E.g., professional lutherie training on how to repair vintage 1960s-era guitars and effects, familiarity with repairing and maintaining 1960s-era rotating Leslie speaker cabinets—and familiarity with what is, for many, a more obscure music genre). Bass guitar technician Bass guitar technicians (or \\"bass techs\\") perform the same functions for a bass guitar player. The bass guitar is a variety of electric guitar pitched below a regular electric guitar, typically by one octave. Many basic elements of the two types of instruments are similar enough—magnetic pickups routed to an electronic amplifier—that a guitar technician is usually able to work as a bass guitar technician if they become familiar with the unique aspects of the electric bass. The electric bass differs from the electric guitar in several respects. To become a bass tech, a person must learn how to set up the string action (height) and adjust the height of the pickups so that the bassist is able to create the tones associated with different bass styles. Depending on the band, these styles might include such as slap and pop, tapping, or upright bass-style playing with the thumb. As with guitar techs, a bass tech also sets up the amplification equipment and effects pedals. Due to the lower pitch of the bass guitar, this instrument is amplified with specialized bass instrument amplifiers. While bass guitarists do not usually use as many effects pedals as most guitarists (e.g., reverb, chorus, flanger, etc.), most professional bassists may use a few \\"sound conditioner\\" effects such as a compressor, limiter, or equalizer. Some bassists also use octave pedals to generate extremely low pitches or bass overdrive pedals that produce a fuzzy, distorted sound. Although these effects function in the same way as regular electric guitar effects, a bass tech must be familiar with the settings and the resulting sounds and tones that are most often used by bass guitarists. A guitar tech who is in the first stages of learning to become a bass tech may know how to set up the bass effects from a technical point of view, but it may take a little longer for them to learn which compressor settings, for example, are associated with different funk or metal styles. In some country, rockabilly, or jazz bands, the bass tech might also be responsible for setting up, tuning, and maintaining an upright bass or electric upright bass. In some folk or acoustic bands, the bass technician may also be responsible for maintaining an acoustic bass guitar, which is a larger, bass version of a standard acoustic guitar. More rarely, some bass techs might have to set up a bass synth (e.g., as used by the bassists in some alternative bands) or bass pedal keyboard such as a Moog Taurus pedal, as used by Sting or Led Zeppelin. Both upright basses and acoustic bass guitars usually use piezoelectric pickups rather than magnetic pickups, and in some cases, the instruments may use condenser mics to pick up the higher range sounds. To amplify instruments with piezo transducers and condenser mics, specialized impedance-matching preamplifiers are often required. Also, since both piezoelectric transducers and microphones are more prone to unwanted feedback than magnetic pickups, the bass tech may have to set up a notch filter with a parametric equalizer to reduce the frequency that is feeding back.

Etymology The epithet philipipi is in honor of Philip Monroe Klauber, son of herpetologist Laurence Monroe Klauber who named the subspecies.Beltz, Ellin. 1206. Scientific and Common Names of the Reptiles and Amphibians of North America - Explained. Geographic range It is found in the southwestern United States, from the far western tip of Texas, through New Mexico, and into Arizona, as well as into northern Mexico. Its range overlaps that of other glossy snake subspecies, and interbreeding is likely. Thus, distinguishing subspecies which share range is often difficult. Description The Painted Desert glossy snake is typically a light tan brown in color, with darker brown blotches down the length of the back. This subspecies usually has around 60 blotches, which is a greater number than in other subspecies. Each blotch is usually edged with black. The underside is usually solid cream or white in color. The coloration can vary, lighter or darker, depending on the soil and elevation of the localized habitat, with specimens from higher elevations often being darker in color. Adults can be from 20 to 35 inches (50 to 90 cm) in total length. They have a thin body, with smooth dorsal scales, and the pupil of the eye is round. In females of Arizona elegans philipi the length of the tail is greater than 13.5% of the total body length; in males, greater than 14.5%. In most specimens the smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 27 rows at midbody.Smith, H.M., and E.D. Brodie, Jr. 1982. Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. Golden Press. New York. 240 pp. (paperback). (Arizona elegans philipi, p. 182.) Habitat Their preferred habitat is sandy and rocky arid regions, it is often found in areas of lightly vegetated with creosote bush and sagebrush. Diet Their diet consists of lizards, and small rodents. They are nocturnal, and can often be found foraging in roadside ditches in the late evening. Reproduction Mating occurs in spring, and the female lays a clutch of up to 24 eggs which hatch in the fall. Hatchlings are 9-11 inches (23–28 cm) in total length.

The secret societies declared they would support Faisal's father Hussein bin Ali's revolt against the Ottoman Empire, if the demands in the protocol were submitted to the British. These demands, defining the territory of an independent Arab state to be established in the Middle East that would encompass all of the lands of Ottoman Western Asia south of the 37th parallel north,Ismael, 1991, p. 65. became the basis of the Arab understanding of the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence. Text The text was first translated into English by George Antonius in 1938, based on a copy of the protocol given to him by Faisal: > \\"The recognition by Great Britain of the independence of the Arab countries > lying within the following frontiers: > North: The Line Mersin-Adana to parallel 37N. and thence along the line > Birejek-Urga-Mardin-Midiat-Jazirat (Ibn 'Unear)-Amadia to the Persian > frontier; > East: The Persian frontier down to the Persian Gulf; > South: The Indian Ocean (with the exclusion of Aden, whose status was to be > maintained). > West: The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea back to Mersin. > The abolition of all exceptional privileges granted to foreigners under the > capitulations. > The conclusion of a defensive alliance between Great Britain and the future > independent Arab State. > The grant of economic preference to Great Britain.\\" Background Sayyid Hussein bin Ali, Sharif and Emir of Mecca, King of Hejaz =Negotiations with Kitchener= On 5 February 1914 the sharif's son Abdullah met Herbert Kitchener, British Governor General of Egypt and the Sudan, in Cairo and asked him whether Hussein could rely on British support in the event of Turkish moves against the Hejaz. At this point Kitchener could offer no encouragement, but two months later Abdullah met with Kitchener's Oriental Secretary, Sir Ronald Storrs, and was given the assurance that Great Britain would guarantee the status quo in Arabia against \\"wanton Turkish aggression\\".Paris, 2003, p. 22. Abdullah I bin al-Hussein, King of Jordan (1949–1951) was born in Mecca, Ottoman Empire (currently Saudi Arabia) British reluctance to oppose the Turks evaporated following the onset of war in August 1914. Kitchener, then Secretary of State for War, sent a message to Abdullah asking whether the Arabs would support Great Britain if Turkey joined the war on the side of Germany. Abdullah responded that the Sharif would support Britain in return for British support against the Turks. Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener By the time of Kitchener's reply in October the Turks had joined the Germans, > Kitchener now stated that if the Amir and the 'Arab Nation' supported > Britain in the war, the British would recognise and support the independence > of the Amirate and of the Arabs and, further, would guarantee Arabia against > external aggression. And then Kitchener gratuitously and on his own > authority added a phrase that would generate controversy in London and the > Middle East for years to come. 'It may be,' he concluded, 'that an Arab of > the true race will assume the Caliphate at Mecca or Medina and so good may > come by the help of God out of all the evil that is now occurring'.Paris, > 2003, p. 23. In his reply Hussein did not mention the Caliphate but said that he could not immediately break with the Turks because of his position in Islam. =Turkish declaration of jihad= On 11 November 1914 the Turks declared a jihad against the Entente (Allies of World War I) and urged the Arab leader Husayn bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, to support the call and to contribute troops to their forces. According to Schneer, in January 1915, Hussein was approached by Fauzi al- Bakri (brother of Nasib al-Bakri, both members of Al-Fatat and whose father was an old friend of Hussein) with the aim of persuading the Sharif to become leader of a revolt against the Ottomans. At the same time Hussein's eldest son Ali bin Hussein uncovered a Turkish plot to depose the Sharif in favour of Ali Haidar, head of the dispossessed Motallib branch of the Sharifian family.British Imperial Connexions to the Arab National Movement, 1912-1914, accessed 8 April 2007. Hussein ordered his son Faisal to confront the Grand Vizier in Constantinople with evidence of the plot, but also to stop in Damascus to explore the viability of a revolt with the leaders of the secret societies, which he did on 26 March 1915. After a month of talks Faisal was unconvinced of the strength of the Arab movement and concluded that a revolt would not succeed without the assistance of one of the Great Powers. On reaching Constantinople in April and receiving the news that an Arab declaration of jihad was viewed as essential by the Turks Faisal became equally concerned about his family's position in the Hejaz. On his return journey Faisal visited Damascus to resume talks with al-Fatat and Al-'Ahd and joined their revolutionary movement. It was during this visit that Faisal was presented with the document that became known as the 'Damascus Protocol'. The document declared that the Arabs would revolt in alliance with Great Britain in return for recognition of Arab independence in an area running from the 37th parallel north on the southern border of Turkey, bounded in the east by Persia and the Persian Gulf, in the west by the Mediterranean Sea and in the south by the Arabian Sea.Paris, 2003, p. 24. =Meeting at Ta'if= Following deliberations at Ta'if between Hussein and his sons in June 1915, during which Faisal counselled caution, Ali argued against rebellion and Abdullah advocated action, the Sharif set a tentative date for armed revolt for June 1916 and commenced negotiations with the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon via the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence.

Arabsat was created to deliver satellite-based, public and private telecommunications services to the Arab States, in accordance with International Standards. With 21 member countries, the organization plays a vital role of enhancing communications in the Arab World. The Arabsat satellites are a series of geostationary communications satellites launched from 1985 through 2019. Some of the later satellites in the series remain operational in orbit, while others have been retired and are derelict. History The foundation of Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Arabsat) dates from the late 1960s. In 1967, information ministers of Arab states developed a series of principles in relation to a satellite network, to create an integration of social and cultural activities among the Arab League countries. On the other hand, the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ASBU) was established in 1969. Saudi Arabia did not join this Egypt-led and Cairo-based union until 1974, most probably due to the tense relationship between Saudi Arabia and Egypt at the time. On 14 April 1976, Arabsat was formed under Arab League jurisdiction with the goal of serving the information, cultural and educational needs of its member states. Saudi Arabia was the main financier of the new organization due to its expanded financial resources as a result of its flourishing oil-exporting industry. Riyadh housed Arabsat's headquarters. The first launch Arabsat-1A was performed by a French Ariane rocket. The American Space Shuttle Discovery launched Arabsat's second satellite, Arabsat-1B, in 1985. Arabsat-1A and -1B were switched off in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Shareholders Arab League members and Arabsat shareholders All Arab League states except for Comoros are shareholders of Arabsat: * 36.7% * 14.6% * 11.3% * 9.8% * 4.7% * 4% * 3.8% * 2.5% * 2.1% * 1.9% * 1.7% * 1.7% * 1.6% * 1.2% * 0.7% * 0.6% * 0.3% * 0.3% * 0.2% * 0.2% * 0.1% Satellites = Arabsat-1 = Arabsat-1 was the model designator for a series of first- generation satellites built by an international team led by Aérospatiale of France. It is a satellite with three-axis stabilized Spacebus 100 spacecraft with two deployable solar array wings, making it almost 68 ft (20.7 m) long and over 18 ft (5.5 m) wide when deployed in orbit. It weighs about 2,800 lb (1,270 kg) in its initial orbit, but some 1,490 lb (675 kg) of this is propellant. It has an onboard low-thrust motor that utilizes hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, and transfers from an initial elliptical to geosynchronous orbit by firing this motor. The remaining propellant is then used for station- keeping or moving over the life of the satellite. Arabsat-1A, the first Arabsat satellite, was launched by Ariane on 8 February 1985. Shortly after launch it suffered a solar panel extension malfunction. Coupled with other failures, the satellite was soon relegated to backup status until it was abandoned completely in late 1991. Arabsat-1B, the second flight model, was deployed in June 1985, from the Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS-51-G, and placed into service near 26.0° East, and remained in operation until mid-1992. Arabsat-1C, the third satellite of the series, was launched by Ariane on 26 February 1992, as a stop-gap measure to maintain network services until the Arabsat second generation spacecraft became available. Arabsat-1D, was renamed from the Anik-D2 (a Hughes HS-376 bus originally carrying 24 active C-band transponders). =Arabsat-2= By the end of 1994, the Arabsat system had been reduced to only one operational satellite. A contract for two Arabsat second-generation satellites was signed with Aérospatiale in April 1993, to build several additional comsats based on the Spacebus 3000A platform. Arabsat-2A, was launched on 9 July 1996. Arabsat-2B, was launched on 13 November 1996. Arabsat-2C was leased from PAS-5 in May 2002 and moved from the Western Hemisphere during November 2002 to a position at 26.0° E. Arabsat-2D was leased from Hot Bird 5 and moved from the position 13.0° E during November 2002 to a position at 26.0° E. =Arabsat-3= On 7 November 1996, a contract was signed with Aérospatiale (Alcatel) to provide the first of the third-generation satellites, to be based on a Spacebus 3000B2 platform. BADR-3 (technically: Arabsat-3A), weighed (at launch) and (in orbit), was launched by a launcher Ariane-44L (# 28) (V-116) from ELA-2 at Centre Spatial Guyanais at 26.0° East with a lifespan of 15 years, as the first satellite of the third generation, on 26 February 1999 at 22:44:00 UTC.Gunter's Space Page, BADR-3 Half of its 20 transponders Ku were switched off on 7 December 2001 after a solar-panel malfunction. =Arabsat-4= Arabsat let a contract on 22 October 2003 for the manufacture and launch of the fourth generation of Arabsat satellites, based on the Astrium's Eurostar E2000+ platform and Alcatel Space payload.

The second fourth generation satellite, named BADR-4 (technically: Arabsat-4B), was launched on 8 November 2006. BADR-6 was launched on 7 July 2008 on an Ariane 5, to replace the lost Arabsat-4A. =Arabsat-5= Arabsat let a contract on 16 June 2007 for the manufacture and launch of the fifth generation of Arabsat satellites, based on the Astrium's Eurostar E3000 platform and Thales Alenia Space payloads: * The first of the fifth-generation satellites, named BADR-5 (technically: Arabsat-5B), was launched by Proton at Arabsat's 26.0° East Direct-to-Home television \\"Hot Spot\\" on 3 June 2010. * The second of the fifth-generation satellites, Arabsat-5A, was launched by Ariane at the 30.5° East orbital location on 26 June 2010. * The third of the fifth-generation satellites, Arabsat-5C, was launched to the new 20.0° East orbital location on 21 September 2011.SpaceFlight.com =Arabsat-6= Badr-7 (Arabsat-6B) was launched successfully in tandem with GSat-15 on 10 November 2015 from the Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, atop an Ariane 5 launcher. * The launch of ArabSat 6A with a Falcon Heavy rocket was on 11 April 2019. Controversies Associated with Arabsat In July 2019, some of the biggest football authorities that control the Premier League, World Cup and Champions League, called on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to stop its homegrown piracy of TV and streaming service, illicitly broadcasting matches globally via Arabsat. Saudi was strongly criticized in a letter issued by sports bodies including, FIFA, UEFA, Spain's La Liga, Germany's Bundesliga and Italy's Serie A along with the Asian Football Confederation. The letter was issued after 18 months of failed efforts at legally challenging Saudi Arabia to block beoutQ for pirate broadcasting the entire World Cup 2018. The authorities said in a joint statement, \\"We collectively condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing theft of our intellectual property by the pirate broadcaster known as beoutQ and call on the authorities in Saudi Arabia to support us in ending the widespread and flagrant breaches of our intellectual property rights\\". The sporting bodies have also accused nine Saudi Arabian legal firms of not taking on their copyright infringement case, following which the authorities are seeking to adopt other means for the shut down of the state-run broadcaster.

The population in 2011 was 1,352,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 166.07 km².Áreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e país History São Marcos takes its name from Saint Mark, the Evangelist. Since 1999, several apparitions of the Virgin Mary as Our Lady Mother of Goodness (Nossa Senhora da Bondade) were reported near São Marcos da Serra, resulting in some worldwide notoriety, in particular by the Catholic youth and priests. Although these events resulted in pilgrimages by some faithful to the northern Algarve, the Holy See have never officially recognized these apparitions. Geography The São Marcos da Serra railway station, now abandoned after the discontinuation of service at the beginning of the 21st century The Quercus suber, the common cork oak is one of the primary sources of income in the region The parish seat of São Marco is north-northeast of the centre of Silves and is south-southeast of Lisbon. Located between the junction between the Serra do Caldeirão and the Serra de Monchique mountain ridges, the parish is intersected by the Riberia de Odelouca, which bisects the main village, also known as the Ribeira de São Marcos. The Odelouca receives water from two tributary streams: the Ribeira de Azilheire and Ribeira de Besteiros. A typical mountain community, the buildings are spread over the slopes of the mountain valleys, resulting in steep roadways. At the highest point of the village is the parish church, located in the main square, whose western extent is also used as a market. A landscaped space, the square is bordered by the church, across from the health center, while a statue of Doctor Antonio Bernardino Ramos is located at its centre. On the heights along the rail-line, are the urban developments of Poleirão and Montezinhos, consisting of the typical whitewashed buildings, in addition to several cafés and a restaurant. The parish seat is located west of the IC1 roadway that links the Algarve to Lisbon, through Santana da Serra and Ourique. In addition, there is a direct link to Silves, while the municipal road 541 connects São Marcos to Alferce by way of Nave Redonda. Until recently rail service supported the bus services in the morning and afternoon between São Marcos and São Bartolomeu de Messines, but were discontinued in the early 21st century. Economy São Marcos da Serra is a main supplier of Cork, as well as a producer of grain cereals, including wheat, barley and oats, at one time supported by several traditional windmills that dotted the parish. Beekeeping is common in the hills surrounding the parish, resulting in an itinerant economy in wax and honey collected from local beehives. While a subsistence supply of fruits and vegetables continue to be produced in the district, the cultivation peaches (rare for this area) have been discontinued. The foothills of the parish are also favored by local hunters. Industrial and secondary industries are primarily involved in supporting agricultural extraction, but also include the production of the arbutus brandy, Comel, a spirit distilled locally. São Marcos da Serra also supports a nascent music recording technology, known as Dynamic Convolution, developed by Sintefex Audio Lda., resulting in the award-winning music recording products. Notable citizens The bust of Doctor António Bernardino Ramos, celebrated physician and citizen * António Bernardino Ramos, was a medical practitioner and humanitarian, who lived and practiced in São Marcos da Serra, who was honoured with a statue which was erected before his death.

Biography One of a famous family of Civil War officers, the \\"Fighting McCooks,\\" he was born in Carrollton, Ohio, a son of Daniel McCook. He was educated at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and was a member of the Naval Lodge #69 of the Freemasons in New York City. When the Civil War erupted, McCook recruited a company and joined the 31st Illinois Infantry, serving under his friend, Col. John A. Logan. He saw action in the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, where he was severely wounded. He was later assigned to command Logan's brigade when the latter assumed division command. By the Vicksburg Campaign, McCook had again been promoted to replace Logan as division commander, leading it during the Siege of Vicksburg under Ulysses S. Grant. In 1864, he served with distinction in the Chattanooga and Atlanta campaigns and in the March to the Sea under William T. Sherman. He was severely wounded three separate times but survived the war. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated McCook for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, John H., and David J.

This telenovela ran for 126 episodes and was distributed internationally by RCTV International. Roxana Diaz and Carlos Montilla star as the main protagonists with Julie Restifo, Franklin Virgüez and Catherine Correia as the antagonists. Synopsis On the day of the Festival Of The Moon, a gypsy predicts that the soulful heiress Teresa Larrazabal will meet three men. The mystical ”spell of the stardust” will unmask one who will help her, one who will destroy her and one who will be the love of her life. But the spell undergoes a sinister twist at the hands of the embittered Belgica Michelena. She casts a terrible sentence on the innocence of true love, hurling Teresa toward an unwilling fate as her pawn in a mysterious game of seduction, sorcery and revenge. Belgica unites a powerful hatred for Teresa’s father Teofilo, the lover who spurned her, with the power of the gypsy’s incantation. But her plan to use sons, Vicente and Pedro Armando, as instruments of her vengeance goes awry when Vicente falls in love with Teresa, challenging both his mother and the supernatural forces that oppose them. It is decreed that Vicente will die if Teresa surrenders to his love. Defiant in their quest to resist Belgica’s depravity, Teresa and Vicente join hands and hearts to undo the evil of the prophecy. As they weave their way through the darkness of the Magic Forest, the full moon’s piercing rays illuminate their paths, helping them to discover the secret that will free them. In their journey to vanquish destiny’s wicked intentions, they affirm that true love weaves the most powerful spell of all.

Weld, a resident of Brookline, Massachusetts and a scion of the Welds of that area, practiced surgery for many years, but ultimately gave it up to manage his family's fortune. He made major contributions to two museums in Greater Boston: Museum of Fine Arts Contributions Weld is well known for his purchase and donation of the collection of Ernest Fenollosa for the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The museum is now home to one of the finest and largest collections of Japanese art outside Japan, numbering over 100,000 objects.Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: Japanese Art In 1886, Weld attempted to sail around the world in his personal yacht. However, while moored in Yokohama, the yacht caught fire and was destroyed. As a result, Weld spent an extended amount of time with his Bostonian friends William Sturgis Bigelow and Ernest Fenollosa. The pair had already been in Japan for some time themselves, exploring the country and collecting art. The Fenollosa-Weld Collection contains many of the most famous pieces in the Museum of Fine Arts' collection. Among them is a handscroll painting (emaki) depicting the 1159 Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace. Others are famous pieces by Sesshū, Kanō Eitoku, and Kanō Hōgai. While Fenollosa and Bigelow developed very widespread and inclusive tastes in art during their time in Japan, Weld's interests remained somewhat narrowly focused. His primary interests in life were sport, boating, and martial activities such as archery. As a result, he became one of the first Americans to collect Japanese swords, spears, and other martial implements as art. In addition to full swords, Weld purchased many sword ornaments, handguards (tsuba), and other sword fittings such as kozuka, tiny blades tied to a swordhilt and used by the samurai for basic utilitarian tasks. In 1911, the collections of Ernest Fenollosa and Charles G. Weld, much of it already physically in the Museum of Fine Arts, on loan indefinitely, became the property of the Museum, as the Fenollosa-Weld Collection. Peabody Essex Museum Contributions Weld also made major contributions to the Peabody Essex Museum. Included among these are 110 photographs that premier American photographer Edward S. Curtis made for his 1905-1906 exhibit. Clark Worswick, curator of photography for the museum, describes them as: > \\"...Curtis' most carefully selected prints of what was then his life’s > work...certainly these are some of the most glorious prints ever made in the > history of the photographic medium.

Epstein (July 26, 1937 - July 9, 2006) was a pediatric neurosurgeon credited for the development of pioneering neurosurgical techniques to treat children threatened by brain and spinal-cord tumors. Education Born in Yonkers, New York, he graduated from New York University and New York Medical College. He did his internship and surgical residency at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and his neurosurgical residency at New York University- Bellevue Medical Center, while serving in the Army reserves, under the tutelage of Joseph Ransohoff. Career In 1983, he was named professor of neurosurgery at New York University (NYU) and two years later director of the division of pediatric neurosurgery by Ransohoff, his former mentor. It was there that he saw the resemblance of operable tumors in the cerebellum and, until then, inoperable ones in the brain stem. He likened the technique he developed to removing lead from a pencil, the pencil being the spinal cord. He founded the division of pediatric neurosurgery at New York University Medical Center, and he was the founding director of the Institute for Neurology and Neurosurgery (INN) at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City. He was president of the International Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery and the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery. He published more than 175 scholarly papers and was editor in chief of The Journal of Pediatric Neurosurgery. In 2001, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons awarded him its Lifetime Achievement Award. He wrote two books for general readers: \\"If I Get to Five\\" and \\"Gifts of Time\\". He was the subject of three segments of “20/20” and made news by operating on the son of the Yankee pitcher Tommy John and on a Tibetan monk for whom the Dalai Lama prayed at the institute. In 1997, he operated on a millionaire's pug in exchange for a donation to help pay for surgery that Epstein then performed on a 5-year-old boy from rural Pennsylvania. In September 2001, he suffered a brain injury due to a bicycle accident, which forced him to retire from active practice. He continued to advise on neurological matters for the Miami Children's Hospital until his death due to melanoma. Quotation > The question, \\"Why do children suffer?\\" has no answer, unless it's simply, > \\"To break our hearts.\\" Once our hearts get broken, they never fully heal. > They always ache. But perhaps a broken heart is a more loving instrument. > Perhaps only after our hearts have cracked wide open, have finally and > totally unclenched, can we truly know love without boundaries.

Andrew Lang included it in The Blue Fairy Book (1889).Andrew Lang, The Blue Fairy Book, \\"Why the Sea Is Salt\\" It is a late parallel to the Old Norse poem Grottasöngr, found in Snorri Sturluson's Skáldskaparmál. Georgios A. Megas collected a Greek variant The Mill in Folktales of Greece.Georgias A. Megas, Folktales of Greece, p 60, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970 It is Aarne-Thompson type 565, the Magic Mill.Georgias A. Megas, Folktales of Greece, p 231, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970 Other tales of this type include The Water Mother and Sweet porridge. Synopsis A poor man begged from his brother on Christmas Eve. The brother promised him, depending on the variant, ham or bacon or a lamb if he would do something. The poor brother promised; the rich one handed over the food and told him to go to Hel (in Lang's version, the Dead Men's Hall; in the Greek, the Devil's dam). Since he promised, he set out. In the Norse variants, he meets an old man along the way. In some variants, the man begs from him, and he gives something; in all, the old man tells him that in Hell (or the hall), they will want to buy the food from him, but he must only sell it for the hand-mill behind the door, and come to him for directions to use it. It took a great deal of haggling, but the poor man succeeded, and the old man showed him how to use it. In the Greek, he merely brought the lamb and told the devils that he would take whatever they would give him, and they gave him the mill. He took it to his wife, and had it grind out everything they needed for Christmas, from lights to tablecloth to meat and ale. They ate well and on the third day, they had a great feast. His brother was astounded and when the poor man had drunk too much, or when the poor man's children innocently betrayed the secret, he showed his rich brother the hand-mill. His brother finally persuaded him to sell it. In the Norse version, the poor brother didn't teach him how to handle it. He set to grind out herrings and broth, but it soon flooded his house. His brother wouldn't take it back until he paid him as much as he paid to have it. In the Greek, the brother set out to Constantinople by ship. In the Norse, one day a skipper wanted to buy the hand-mill from him, and eventually persuaded him. In all versions, the new owner took it to sea and set it to grind out salt. It ground out salt until it sank the boat, and then went on grinding in the sea, turning the sea salty.

Buckaroo! is made by Milton Bradley, a division of the toy company Hasbro.Hasbro Buckaroo page  Description  The game centers on an articulated plastic model of a mule named \\"Roo\\" (or \\"Buckaroo\\"). The mule begins the game standing on all four feet, with a blanket on its back. Players take turns placing various items onto the mule's back without causing the mule to buck up on its front legs, throwing off all the accumulated items (the toy has a spring mechanism that is triggered by significant vibration). The player who triggered this buck is knocked out of the game, and play resumes. The winner is the last player remaining in the game. In the (unlikely) event that a player manages to place the last item onto the mule's back without it bucking, that player is the winner. The toy has three sensitivity levels that are adjustable via a switch located on the side of the mule's body, under the blanket. The switch adjusts the location of the lever to which the blanket is attached in relation to the trigger mechanism attached to the spring.Rules for playing Buckaroo! = Items = The items which players must place on the mule's back are (variations in names from 2007 UK version in parentheses): * a bedroll * a canteen (water bottle) * a cowboy hat * a crate (rifle box) * a frying pan * a guitar * a holster (holster with gun) * a lantern (lamp) * a rope * a saddle * a shovel * a stick of dynamite Of these, the saddle must be placed first. It has a number of articulation points on which the subsequent items are hung. These other items may be placed in any order.  History  It was originally released in 1989 by Ideal Toy Company using a white mule, this has now been replaced with a brown one. =Criticism= In 2006, Buckaroo! was considered dangerous, due to the objects getting flung off the mule when the spring is triggered. On Good Morning America and CTV News, it was mentioned that an object had hit a child in the eye, in North Carolina, causing the 8-year-old boy to have surgery. The game was discontinued until 2008 when the instructions were adjusted. In popular culture Buckaroo! is a favorite game of Father Dougal McGuire in Irish sitcom Father Ted. He regularly plays the game with Ted, despite the fact that Ted hates it and would rather play chess.

He was stationed in Damascus and played a pivotal role in the events leading up to the Arab Revolt. He was a member of Arab secret societies in Damascus. After the first visit of Faisal bin Hussein to Damascus in early 1915, the societies were suspected by Djemal Pasha of conspiracy and treason against the Ottoman Empire. As a consequence the societies were disbanded and their members dispersed. Al-Faruqi was sent to the Gallipoli front where he deserted in late 1915. He crossed over to the Allied side and claimed to have important information for the British. The British eagerly jumped on the source of information. Al-Faruqi's poor English made accidental or intentional misunderstandings likely. The information he fed the British was partly true and partly fabricated. Al-Faruqi claimed to be a member of the secret society al-'Ahd and said he represented the Arab army officers in Damascus. He urged the British to support an independent Arab state as outlined in the Damascus Protocol during the correspondence with Hussein. He claimed any delay would make Hussein fully support Germany and the Ottomans. Al-Faruqi's claims solidified British Egypt's conceptions that the Arab world was ready for a revolt. Kitchener's followers in Egypt and elsewhere used this information to persuade Henry McMahon to meet Hussein's demands. An Arab revolt would relieve in part the British forces fighting the Ottomans. In the following negotiations concerning this issue al-Faruqi managed to be the centrepiece by claiming to each party to represent an opportune other party. Faruqi was killed on a road in Iraq in 1920 during a tribal raid.

Fazio played linebacker and center at the University of Pittsburgh, and was drafted by the Boston Patriots of the American Football League, but never played professionally. He returned to Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, where he grew up, to begin his coaching career at the high school level, and then moved to the college ranks. He was hired as head coach by his alma mater, Pitt in 1982, having previously been defensive coordinator under Jackie Sherrill, leading the team to a 25–18–3 record in four seasons before being fired. Several of Fazio's defenses have been acclaimed as some of the best units in college football history, particularly the #2-ranked 1980 team which featured several players who went on to have successful careers in the NFL, including Rickey Jackson, Bill Maas, Carlton Williamson, and Hugh Green, who finished second in the 1980 Heisman Trophy balloting. After Fazio's stint as head coach at Pitt, Lou Holtz then hired him to serve as the defensive coordinator at the University of Notre Dame. At the college level, Fazio also coached at Boston University, Harvard University and the University of Cincinnati.

History and design Fiera di Milano/Milan Fair. After World War II, when Italians could ill afford personal transportation, aircraft designer Corradino D'Ascanio, in 1947 , conceived a light and simple three-wheeled commercial vehicle, finding favour with Piaggio. The first model was a cabless adaptation of the company's two-wheel scooter, the Vespa, adding two rear wheels and a flat utility bed over the rear axle. Initial models featured 50 cc, 125 cc or 150 cc and more recently 175 cc engines. By the time of the 1964 Ape D, a cab was added to protect the driver from the elements. An Ape 50 Van in Green Sherwood With handlebar style steering (a steering wheel became a later innovation), the original Ape was designed as a single-seater, now able to accommodate two passengers of modest size. A door is provided on each side, to facilitate entry and exit. Performance is modest, suited to light delivery, with good torque for hills and a low top speed. On larger roads, Apes may be driven close to the curb to allow other vehicles to pass.

He is famous for many of his various theses on Mimamsa, such as Mimamsaslokavarttika. Bhaṭṭa was a staunch believer in the supreme validity of Vedic injunction, a great champion of Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā and a confirmed ritualist.Sharma, pp. 5–6. The Varttika is mainly written as a subcommentary of Sabara's commentary on Jaimini's Purva Mimamsa Sutras. His philosophy is classified by some scholars as existential realism.Bhatt, p. 6. Scholars differ as regards Kumārila Bhaṭṭa's views on a personal God. For example, Manikka Vachakar believed that Bhaṭṭa promoted a personal GodA History of Indian Philosophy By Surendranath Dasgupta. p. 156. (saguna brahman), which conflicts with the Mīmāṃsā school. In his Varttika, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa goes to great lengths to argue against the theory of a creator GodBales, p. 198. and held that the actions enjoined in the Veda had definite results without an external interference of Deity. Kumārila is also credited with the logical formulation of the Mimamsic belief that the Vedas are unauthored (apauruṣeyā). In particular, his defence against medieval Buddhist positions on Vedic rituals is noteworthy. Some believe that this contributed to the decline of Buddhism in India,Sheridan, p. 198-201 because his lifetime coincides with the period in which Buddhism began to decline. Indeed, his dialectical success against Buddhists is confirmed by Buddhist historian Taranatha, who reports that Kumārila defeated disciples of Buddhapalkita, Bhavya, Dharmadasa, Dignaga and others.Arnold, p. 4. His work strongly influenced other schools of Indian philosophy,Bhatt, p. 3. with the exception that while Mimamsa considers the Upanishads to be subservient to the Vedas, the Vedanta school does not think so.  Early life  The birthplace of Kumārila Bhatta is uncertain. According to the 16th-century Buddhist scholar Taranatha, Kumārila was a native of South India. However, Anandagiri's Shankara-Vijaya states that Kumarila came from \\"the North\\" (udagdeśāt), and persecuted the Buddhists and the Jains in the South. Another theory is that he came from eastern India, specifically Kamarupa (present-day Assam). Sesa's Sarvasiddhanta-rahasya uses the eastern title Bhattacharya for him. His writings indicate that he was familiar with the production of silk, which was common in present-day Assam. Yet another theory is that he comes from Mithila, which has similar culture to Bengal and Assam. Linguistics views Kumārila Bhaṭṭa and his followers in the Mīmāṃsā tradition known as ' argued for a strongly Compositional view of semantics called abhihitānvaya or \\"designation of what has been denoted.\\" In this view, the meaning of a sentence was understood only after understanding first the meanings of individual words. Word referents were independent, complete objects, a view that is close to the Fodorian view of language, according to philosopher Daniel Arnold. He also used several Tamil words in his works, including one of the earliest mention of the name Dravida in North Indian sources, found in his Tantravārttika. The above-mentioned view of sentence meaning was debated over some seven or eight centuries by the followers of Prabhākara school within Mīmāṃsā, who argued that words do not directly designate meaning. Rather, word meanings are understood as already connected with other words (anvitābhidhāna, anvita = connected; abhidhāna = denotation). This view was influenced by the holistic arguments of Bhartṛhari's theory. Essentially the Prābhākaras argued that sentence meanings are grasped directly, from perceptual and contextual cues, skipping the stage of grasping singly the individual word meanings,Matilal, p. 108. similar to the modern view of linguistic underspecification, which relates to the Dynamic Turn in Semantics, that also opposes purely compositional approaches to sentence meaning. Criticism of Buddhism With the aim to prove the superiority of Vedic scripture, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa presented several novel arguments: 1\\\\. \\"Buddhist (or Jain) scripture could not be correct because it had several grammatical lapses.\\" He specifically takes the Buddhist verse: 'ime samkhada dhamma sambhavanti sakarana akarana vinassanti' (These phenomena arise when the cause is present and perish when the cause is absent). Thus he presents his argument:Pollock, p. 55. > The scriptures of Buddhists and Jains are composed in overwhelmingly > incorrect (asadhu) language, words of the Magadha or Dakshinatya languages, > or even their dialects (tadopabhramsa). Therefore false compositions > (asannibandhana), they cannot possibly be true knowledge (shastra) ... By > contrast, the very form itself (the well-assembled language) of the Veda > proves its authority to be independent and absolute. 2\\\\. Every extant school held some scripture to be correct. To show that the Veda was the only correct scripture, Kumārila ingeniously said that \\"the absence of an author would safeguard the Veda against all reproach\\" (apaurusheya).Jha, p. 31. There was \\"no way to prove any of the contents of Buddhist scriptures directly as wrong in spirit...\\", unless one challenges the legitimacy and eternal nature of the scripture itself. It is well known that the Pali Canon was composed after the Buddha's parinirvana. Further, even if they were the Buddha's words, they were not eternal or unauthored like the Vedas. 3\\\\. The Sautrantika Buddhist school believed that the universe was momentary (kshanika). Kumārila said that this was absurd, given that the universe does not disappear every moment. No matter how small one would define the duration of a moment, one could divide the moment into infinitely further parts. Kumārila argues: \\"if the universe does not exist between moments, then in which of these moments does it exist?\\" Because a moment could be infinitesimally small, Bhaṭṭa argued that the Buddhist was claiming that the universe was non-existent. 4\\\\. The Determination of perception (pratyaksha pariccheda).Taber, p?? Some scholars believe that Kumārila's understanding of Buddhist philosophy was far greater than that of any other non-Buddhist philosopher of his time.Rani, p?? However, see Taber 2010 for an alternate view. According to Buton Rinchen Drub, Kumārila spoke abusively towards his nephew, Dharmakīrti, as he was taking his brahminical garments. This drove Dharmakīrti away, and resolving to vanquish all non-Buddhist heretics he took the robes of the Buddhist order instead. Legendary life According to legend, Kumārila went to study Buddhism at Nalanda (the largest 4th-century university in the world), with the aim of refuting Buddhist doctrine in favour of Vedic religion. He was expelled from the university when he protested against his teacher (Dharmakirti) ridiculing the Vedic rituals. Legend has it that even though he was thrown off of the university's tower, he survived with an eye injury. (Modern Mimamsa scholars and followers of Vedanta believe that this was because he imposed a condition on the infallibility of the Vedas thus encouraging the Hindu belief that one should not even doubt the infallibility of the Vedas.) One medieval work on the life of Sankara (considered most accurate) claims that Sankara challenged Bhaṭṭa to a debate on his deathbed.'Madhaviya Sankara Digvijayam' by medieval Vijayanagara biographer Madhava, Sringeri Sharada Press Kumārila Bhaṭṭa could not debate Sankara and instead directed him to argue with his student Mandana Misra in Mahiṣmati. He said: :\\"You will find a home at whose gates there are a number of caged parrots discussing abstract topics like — 'Do the Vedas have self-validity or do they depend on some external authority for their validity? Are karmas capable of yielding their fruits directly, or do they require the intervention of God to do so? Is the world eternal, or is it a mere appearance?'

The gameplay loosely follows plot elements from the first and second Karate Kid films.The Karate Kid game overview at MobyGames Later that year, a fighting game (like International Karate) was released on the Amiga and Atari ST by Microdeal (The Karate Kid Part 2: The Computer Game). Gameplay There are four levels in the game, and they play out as the movie goes. The object of each level is to defeat a variety of enemies ranging from Karate students to thugs. =Level 1= The game begins with Daniel LaRusso fighting in the All Valley Karate Tournament (the location for the first Karate Kid film's climax). He will have to go through four fighters in order to advance to the next stage. The opponent's energy bar increases as the player progresses through them. The final fight is presumably with Johnny Lawrence from the movie. =Level 2= Daniel then starts the second level which is set in Okinawa (the primary setting for The Karate Kid Part II). There, he must dispatch random thugs who die in one hit while progressing to Chozen at the end of the stage. For every few enemies dispatched, Daniel can collect large \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" symbols that allow him to use Crane Kicks and Drum Punches, respectively. They also replenish a low amount of Daniel's energy meter. There are also a few obvious and not-so-obvious entrances where Daniel can earn Drum Punches and Crane Kicks by either breaking ice-blocks, catching flies with chopsticks, or dodging a swinging hammer. =Level 3= In the third stage of play, Daniel is in a stage that is nearly identical to the second (with some tricky jumps) during a typhoon. The typhoon causes a strong wind to interfere with the player's jumps and various objects (sticks, birds) to fly through the air and threaten the player's energy. They can be hit for extra points, however. The boss is Chozen Toguchi again and this time, there is a girl up on a pole that Daniel must save. It is not necessary to beat Chozen, only rescue the girl. =Level 4= The final stage is the festival after the typhoon. Daniel wears a new outfit for this stage and the random enemies are now tougher, requiring two hits to be felled. There are also enemies with spears who take even more hits to defeat. The final boss, once again Chozen, has a new twist. Now he has Kumiko down on the ground beside him and if Daniel does not occasionally come into contact with her, she will slip off the platform and drown. This will result in a lost life. If Daniel can successfully defeat the boss without Kumiko drowning the player will be treated to a brief ending. A large image of Mr. Miyagi's head appears and is animated to look as if he's talking and saying \\"You have successfully guided Daniel-san through all the challenges and have become a martial arts master!\\". Upon saying this, Miyagi then winks to the player.

It was built on Petřín Hill between 1360 and 1362 by order of Charles IV. Marl from quarries on Petřín Hill was used as construction material. The purpose of the construction was to strengthen the fortifications of Prague Castle and Malá Strana against any attack from the west or south. Originally the wall was 4 to 4.5 metres high and 1.8 metres wide and was equipped with battlements and (probably) eight bastions. The wall was repaired in 1624, further strengthened in the middle of 18th century and repaired or modified several times later (in modern era in 1923-25 and 1975). One of preserved bastions serves as a base for the dome of Štefánik Observatory. A well preserved part of the wall may also be found in the interior yard of the 19th-century house in Plaská Street No.8. The name and associated myths View at the Prague Castle (on the right) and Petřín Hill with Hunger Wall by Václav Hollar from the 17th century The wall was originally called Zubatá (toothed) or Chlebová (built for bread). The adjective Hladová (hungry) appeared after a 1361 famine, when the construction works on the wall provided livelihood for the city's poor. According to myth, the purpose of the wall was not strategic but to employ and thus feed the poor. Another myth, recorded in writings of Václav Hájek z Libočan or Bohuslav Balbín, is that the Emperor Charles IV himself worked on the wall several hours every day \\"to help his beloved people\\".

He served as rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim in Radun, Poland. Early years Naftoli Trop was born in Grodno, where he studied with his father, Rabbi Moshe Trop, who was rosh yeshiva of a local yeshiva. At 14, he left to learn in Kelm, where his study partner for ten years was Yerucham Levovitz, who went on to become mashgiach of the Mir yeshiva. Rabbi Trop proceeded to briefly study in Slabodka and Telz, where he became close to Eliezer Gordon. He learned for a short time in the Novardok yeshiva in Slonim, where he formed a close relationship with Yosef Yozel Horwitz (known as \\"the Alter of Novardok\\"). In 1889, when Yaakov Yitzchak (Itzele) Rabinowitz was appointed rosh yeshiva at Slabodka, Trop returned to Slabodka to study under Rabinowitz. At the age of twenty-one, Trop became engaged to the daughter of Nosson Tzvi Finkel. However, she died a few months before the wedding. In 1895, Trop married Pesya Leah, the daughter of Eliezer Yaakov Chavas of Yanishok. Shortly after the wedding, he returned to Kelm where he joined a large group of young married scholars. He was greatly influenced by the mussar movement approach he chiefly absorbed in Kelm, but also in Slobodka and by means of his contact with Horowitz in Slonim. After four years of studying in Kelm, Trop was appointed rosh yeshiva of the Or HaChaim yeshiva in Slabodka, by its founder, Tzvi (Hirshel) Levitan. Raduń In 1903, by invitation of Yisrael Meir Kagan, Trop replaced Rabbi Moshe Landinski as rosh yeshiva in Raduń, where he remained for the rest of his life. Among his students in Radin were Dovid Leibowitz, Yechezkel Sarna and Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman. Kahaneman studied for over five years in Raduń under Trop. Family Trop's wife, Pesya Leah, contracted typhus and died in 1920. His oldest son, Avraham, also served as rosh yeshiva in Raduń until the outbreak of World War II. He immigrated to the United States, where he became rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim in New York, and was later rosh yeshiva of the Yeshiva of Karlin-Stolin. He settled in Israel a year before he died in 1978. Trop's second son, Reuven, immigrated to Palestine with the group of Slabodka students who founded the Knesses Yisroel yeshiva in Chevron and later headed the yishuv yeshiva. Trop's oldest daughter, Toiba, married Rabbi Yehoshua Eizek Kaminetsky, also known as \\"Eizekel Kobriner\\", a student of Raduń. He and his family were murdered by the Nazis. His second daughter, Feige, married Boruch Yosef Feivelson, who succeeded Trop as rosh yeshiva of Raduń, but died only four years after his appointment.

In 2000, he helped lead Leigh High School a to CCS Championship in a close win over St. Ignatius. Amateur career Windsor is best known for winning the Most Outstanding Player award in the 2004 College World Series, pitching for the Cal State Fullerton Titans. The Titans upset Texas, with Windsor pitching a complete game 5-hitter to go along with 10 strikeouts in the final. He finished his senior season with a 13-4 record and a 1.72 ERA. Professional career He was drafted in the 3rd round, 97th overall, of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft. Windsor appeared in just 13 games the rest of 2004, all in relief for Vancouver and Kane County. He got off to a promising start for Stockton in 2005, posting a 3.58 ERA in 10 starts. He was called up and did not fare well, putting up a 5.72 ERA in 11 starts for AA Midland. A shoulder injury shortened his season. Windsor bounced back in 2006 going 4-1 with a 2.97 ERA for Midland, and was soon promoted to AAA Sacramento. The success continued as he had a perfect 8-0 record in 12 starts. A 12-1 record at the All-Star break was good enough to receive a promotion to the A's on July 17. Windsor made his MLB debut on July 17, 2006 against the Baltimore Orioles. He pitched five innings, giving up three runs and failing to get a decision. He started again on July 25, but only lasted 2.2 innings, giving up four runs on nine hits and taking the loss, the only decision of his career. He was sent back to the minor leagues shortly thereafter, returning in September to make two more appearances. Windsor returned to Sacramento in 2007, but appeared in only 10 games. He then missed most of the 2008 season while recovering from surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder. He participated in minor league camp with the A's in 2009, but was let go and never pitched professionally again.

He was Labour Member of Parliament for Paddington North from 1946 to 1953. Early life Field was the son of a solicitor and grew up in south- west London. He was educated at Richmond County School, then attended the University of London where he took an active part in student politics, opposing appeasement of Germany. On the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Royal Army Service Corps and later served in the Intelligence Corps. At the end of the war, Field was demobilised swiftly as he had been selected as Labour Party candidate for Hampstead; in the Labour landslide election of 1945, Field reduced a Conservative majority of over 20,000 to 1,638. Political career Later that year Field was elected to Hammersmith Borough Council. He swiftly became the dominant figure and was made council leader the following year. He was also selected to follow Sir Noel Mason-Macfarlane as Labour candidate for Paddington North following Mason-Macfarlane's resignation for ill-health reasons, and retained the seat. He improved his majority against the national trend in the 1950 general election, and was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Michael Stewart and John Strachey. In opposition after October 1951, Field was highly regarded and thought likely to be appointed as a Minister if a Labour government were formed. Downfall In 1953, Field was spotted by a policeman acting suspiciously in public lavatories in the West End of London. The officer arrested him for \\"importuning for immoral purposes\\", an offence which meant seeking out homosexual partners. Field gave his occupation as biochemist and pleaded guilty, but when the press discovered his real job and reported the case, he changed his plea to not guilty.West London Observer 30 January 1953 Field was convicted on one charge and fined £15. He immediately appealed, with his defence led by the Conservative MP John Maude who was reported to have given his services free. Maude was a spirited advocate for his cause, accusing the policeman involved of having committed perjury. Unfortunately for Field, Maude could not persuade the Appeal Court and the conviction was upheld. Field then resigned his seat and disappeared from London. He declined to give his new address to Who's Who. Later life Field had actually moved to Fontmell Magna in Dorset. He followed his academic interest in Egyptology; he was a lecturer at the University of the Third Age until his death in 2002 aged 93.

Parker in 1998. The Parkerian hexad adds three additional attributes to the three classic security attributes of the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability). The Parkerian Hexad attributes are the following: * Confidentiality * Possession or Control * Integrity * Authenticity * Availability * Utility These attributes of information are atomic in that they are not broken down into further constituents; they are non-overlapping in that they refer to unique aspects of information. Any information security breach can be described as affecting one or more of these fundamental attributes of information. Attributes from the CIA triad =Confidentiality= Confidentiality refers to limits on who can get what kind of information. For example, executives concerned about protecting their enterprise's strategic plans from competitors; individuals are concerned about unauthorized access to their financial records. =Integrity= Integrity refers to being correct or consistent with the intended state of information. Any unauthorized modification of data, whether deliberate or accidental, is a breach of data integrity. For example, data stored on disk are expected to be stable – they are not supposed to be changed at random by problems with a disk controller. Similarly, application programs are supposed to record information correctly and not introduce deviations from the intended values. From Donn Parker: \\"My definition of information integrity comes from the dictionaries. Integrity means that the information is whole, sound, and unimpaired (not necessarily correct). It means nothing is missing from the information it is complete and in intended good order.\\" The author's statement comes close in saying that the information is in a correct...state. Information may be incorrect or not authentic but have integrity or correct and authentic but lacking in integrity. =Availability= Availability means having timely access to information. For example, a disk crash or denial-of-service attacks both cause a breach of availability. Any delay that exceeds the expected service levels for a system can be described as a breach of availability. Parker's added attributes =Authenticity= Authenticity refers to the veracity of the claim of origin or authorship of the information. For example, one method for verifying the authorship of a hand written document is to compare the handwriting characteristics of the document to a sampling of others which have already been verified. For electronic information, a digital signature could be used to verify the authorship of a digital document using public-key cryptography (could also be used to verify the integrity of the document). =Possession or control= Possession or control: Suppose a thief were to steal a sealed envelope containing a bank debit card and its personal identification number. Even if the thief did not open that envelope, it's reasonable for the victim to be concerned that the thief could do so at any time. That situation illustrates a loss of control or possession of information but does not involve the breach of confidentiality. =Utility= Utility means usefulness. For example, suppose someone encrypted data on disk to prevent unauthorized access or undetected modifications–and then lost the decryption key: that would be a breach of utility. The data would be confidential, controlled, integral, authentic, and available–they just wouldn't be useful in that form. Similarly, conversion of salary data from one currency into an inappropriate currency would be a breach of utility, as would the storage of data in a format inappropriate for a specific computer architecture; e.g., EBCDIC instead of ASCII or 9-track magnetic tape instead of DVD-ROM. A tabular representation of data substituted for a graph could be described as a breach of utility if the substitution made it more difficult to interpret the data. Utility is often confused with availability because breaches such as those described in these examples may also require time to work around the change in data format or presentation. However, the concept of usefulness is distinct from that of availability.

Biography She is mostly known for an effusive volume of poetic elegies published two years after her death by Dionigi Atanagi and containing 279 Italian and 102 Latin poems, some anonymous, and others either penned or attributed to contemporary cultural figures including Lodovico Dolce, Torquato Tasso, Titian, Girolamo Muzio, Luigi Tanzillo, Giuseppe Bettusi, and Benedetto Varchi. Born in Spilimbergo (in the Province of Pordenone), a small town about thirty kilometers northwest of Udine, by report she demonstrated her artistic abilities at a young age. She is compared sometimes with another woman painter, Sofonisba Anguissola (born in Cremona and of greater longevity (1532–1625). Irene studied under Titian for two years. Few if any of her works are known. Her true nature and skills are difficult to sift from the poetic legend; she was for her eulogists the equivalent of the prototypical ever- innocent feminine charm, what Beatrice was to Dante and Laura to Petrarch, although girded with a paint-brush for the craft-oriented Renaissance. The National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.) houses two paintings in relation to her: a portrait of her sister Emilia di Spilimbergo, with a landscape background, has been attributed to her, and a pendant portrait of Irene di Spilimbergo is thought to be by Titian. She died in Venice at the age of 21.

This was the last film that Hughes wrote and directed himself before his death in 2009. Plot Bill Dancer and his young companion Curly Sue are the archetypal homeless folks with hearts of gold. Their scams are aimed not at turning a profit, but at getting enough to eat. After moving from Detroit to Chicago, the duo cons the rich divorce lawyer Grey Ellison into believing she backed her Mercedes into Bill, in hopes of a free meal. When Grey accidentally collides with Bill for real, she insists on putting the two up for the night, even over the objections of her snotty fiancé Walker McCormick. After a confrontation with Bill exposing the truth of the con, Grey lets them stay for as long as they need when she understands the precarious position the homeless pair are in. One night, Bill tells Grey that he is not Sue's father, and he met Sue's mother one night in Florida. After Sue's mother died, Bill raised her himself, growing to love her like his own, thus when they lost their home and money, Bill could not find it in his heart to give Sue up and put her into an orphanage, so he took Sue with him. Grey, thinking Bill has been neglecting and abusing Sue by using her in his cons and scams, suggests Sue stay with her when he leaves, but this only angers Bill, who says that after all the years he looked after her, if he gave up Sue now, people would make fun of her for being on welfare. He tells her that he is not neglecting or abusing Sue; he cares about Sue and his cons are to provide for Sue. However, when it becomes apparent that Sue is completely unable to read or write (despite spelling a difficult word earlier), Grey begins to push even harder for Bill to leave Sue with her. Eventually, Bill realizes that this is where she belongs - in a home, cared for by someone that can give her the advantages that his homeless, nomadic existence lacks. Walker turns them in and Sue gets put into welfare, while Bill is arrested, because he never actually had custody of the child. However, Grey gets Sue out, and Bill is freed. Sue and Grey return to their apartment, and discover a tin ring (the one which was stolen earlier), which Sue takes as a sign that Bill chose to leave her behind with Grey (it is implied that Bill pawned a ring left to Sue by her mother, which he would return to her when it came time for the two to part forever). However, the ring is accompanied by a note that says that he is in another room. Sue happily turns to find Bill, realizing that the ring is not a sign that he will leave her, but a sign that he is going to abandon his old lifestyle in order to give Sue the home she needs and to pursue a romance with Grey. The pair legally adopt Sue, and Grey and Bill are subsequently married. The film ends with Grey and Bill dropping Sue off on her first day of school.

Reception The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. Leonard Maltin gave it one and a half stars out of four in his Movie Guide, and called it \\"A John Hughes formula movie where the formula doesn't work\\". Halliwell's Film Guide calls it \\"Gruesomely sentimental and manipulative\\". Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times declared, \\"John Hughes here graduates from the most successful comedy in film history to scripting and directing a large piece of non-biodegradable tosh.\\" Curly Sue holds a 13% rating according to Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews.

History ASB Bridge with road deck c. 1981 The piers were built in 1890. However, later that year, lack of funding prevented the bridge from being built. In 1909, Waddell & Harrington designed the current bridge and construction started. The bridge is one of two of this type that had car traffic on Route 9 on the upper level, and rail traffic on the lower level. The lower deck could be raised to permit riverboats to pass without interrupting car traffic on top. This design allowed the hangers from the lower deck to go through the truss members of the upper deck. It was built by a combination of Armour Packing Company, Swift & Company, and Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In 1987, the Heart of America Bridge opened to the east to replace the vehicular portion. In 1996, the remaining part of the ASB was designated by the American Society of Civil Engineers as a national landmark in civil engineering. The bridge is now owned by the BNSF Railway. The ASB has a 428-foot main span, and makes it the ninth- longest vertical-lift drawbridge in the United States. Timeline 1890: Nine stone masonry piers built; engineer John Alexander Low Waddell did not agree with piers, funding ceased and the piers would sit unused until 1909. 1909: The companies of Armour Packing House, Swift and Company, and Chicago Burlington & Quincy Railroad put in funds to build bridge. Piers shaved to ten feet above high-water mark, J.A.L. Waddell's firm of Waddell & Harrington created a new design, work begins. December 28, 1911: Bridge opened to traffic, two lanes of automobile on upper level, one track of railroad on lower. 1915 to 1926 On the Jefferson Highway. From Jefferson Highway Association era materials. January 1913: Electric interurban cars begin use of streetcar rails on upper deck. May 2, 1927: South approach span damaged in fire, replaced later that month. August 1927: Bridge taken over by Missouri State Highway Department and tolls removed. Bridge floor replaced. 1932: Steel girder span over Second Street replaced. 1948: Bridge deck replaced, repairs and new lights added. Streetcar rails removed, and opened to four lanes of traffic. 1949: Collars placed around river piers to prevent rust. 1950: Bridge cleaned and repainted. 1951: Bridge survives 1951 flood. 1952: North approach widened. 1966: North approach widened and resurfaced. 1967: Bridge deck repaired. 1981–1982: Repair of girder lines on downstream side of railroad deck. 1987: Heart of America Bridge opened to the east, upper auto deck closed to all traffic. 1988–1989: Upper deck surface removed, and bridge given to Burlington Northern railroad. 1996: Bridge added as a national landmark in civil engineering by the American Society of Civil Engineers, for being only two of that type ever built in the United States See alsoList of crossings of the Missouri River References External linksArmour- Swift-Burlington Bridge on website of American Society of Civil Engineers, Kansas City chapter *Survey number HAER MO-2 - Armour, Swift, Burlington Bridge, Kansas City, Jackson County, MO Category:Railroad bridges in Missouri Category:Bridges in Kansas City, Missouri Category:Bridges completed in 1911 Category:BNSF Railway bridges Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks Category:Vertical lift bridges in Missouri Category:Former toll bridges in Missouri Category:1911 establishments in the United States Category:Metal bridges in the United States ","title":"ASB Bridge"},{"id":"5992880","text":"Diet for a Small Planet is a 1971 bestselling book by Frances Moore Lappé, the first major book to note the environmental impact of meat production as wasteful and a contributor to global food scarcity. She argued for environmental vegetarianism—practicing a vegetarian lifestyle out of concerns over animal-based industries and the production of animal-based products. The book has sold over three million copies and was groundbreaking for arguing that world hunger is not caused by a lack of food but by ineffective food policy. In addition to information on meat production and its impact on hunger, the book features simple rules for a healthy diet and hundreds of meat-free recipes. \\"Its mix of recipes and analysis typified radicals' faith in the ability to combine personal therapy with political activism.\\"Warren mBelasco (1989) Appetite for Change: how the counterculture took on the food industry 1966 — 1988, page 46, Pantheon Books Structure Part I: Earth's Labor Lost—Protein in United States agribusiness * Part II: Bringing Protein Theory Down to Earth—Protein in human nutrition * Part III: Eating From the Earth: Protein Theory Applied—Includes tables of food values, and explanations relating proteins to caloric and economic factors * Part IV: Combining Non- Meat Foods to Increase Protein Values—Guidelines and recipes * Appendices, Notes, Index Protein combining Knowing that her audience would be skeptical that a vegetarian diet could supply sufficient protein, much of the book is devoted to introducing the method of protein combining. With this method of eating, different plant foods are taken together so that their combined amino acid pattern better matches that required by our bodies, termed \\"net protein utilization\\". The general principle of combining foods for optimum net protein utilization combines adjacent pairs of the following: [dairy] with [grains] with [legumes] with [seeds]. But while Lappé was correct that combining would indeed result in a more meat-like protein profile, eating a variety of plant foods throughout the day will provide you with all the amino acids required by humans, in amounts which satisfy growth and maintenance. There is no need to combine foods at individual meals. Complementary Protein Myth Won't Go Away! , Jeff Novick, M.S., R.D., Healthy Times (May 2003) Lappé admitted in the 10th anniversary 1981 version of the book that sufficient protein was easier to get than she had thought at first: :\\"In 1971 I stressed protein complementarity because I assumed that the only way to get enough protein ... was to create a protein as usable by the body as animal protein. In combating the myth that meat is the only way to get high- quality protein, I reinforced another myth. I gave the impression that in order to get enough protein without meat, considerable care was needed in choosing foods. Actually, it is much easier than I thought. :\\"With three important exceptions, there is little danger of protein deficiency in a plant food diet. The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on [1] fruit or on [2] some tubers, such as sweet potatoes or cassava, or on [3] junk food (refined flours, sugars, and fat). Fortunately, relatively few people in the world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole source of calories. In all other diets, if people are getting enough calories, they are virtually certain of getting enough protein.\\"F. M. Lappé (1981) Diet for a Small Planet (), p. 162; emphasis in original In some traditional cuisines there is a balance of 70% whole grains to 30% legumes, which may vary to 80% grains with 20% legumes. This tradition can be seen expressed in three regions:Lappé 1981 page 161 * Latin America: beans with tortillas or rice, * Middle East: bulgar wheat with chickpeas, or pita falafel with hummus, * Asia: soy with rice (southern China, northern Japan, Indonesia), soy with wheat or millet (northern China), or soy with barley (Korea and southern China). The first edition, published by Ballantine, was sponsored by the Friends of the Earth organization. It includes recipes based on the complementary combinations and was followed by a collection, Recipes for a Small Planet by Ellen Buchman Ewald, with an introduction written by Lappé.

The VS-1.6 is an Italian circular plastic-cased scatterable anti-tank blast mine. It has very few metal components and is resistant to overpressure and shock. The mine can also be deployed conventionally and from helicopters. It was produced by Valsella Meccanotecnica, but production has ceased. Description The mine is normally olive green or sand-coloured and is circular with two circular bands around the circumference, which act to cushion shock when the mine is deployed from the air. The fuze is air pressure driven with pressure on the top plate of the mine forcing air into a diaphragm which exerts pressure on the striker. Shocks from overpressure are too short to inflate the diaphragm; additionally the striker must first rotate a locking collar before it can activate the mine, this requires gradual pressure giving even greater resistance to shock. The sealed nature of the mine means that it can be deployed in up to 1 meter of water. The main charge of the mine is relatively small for an anti-tank mine, so it would tend to disable rather than destroy vehicles. An electronically fuzed version of the mine, the VS-1.6EL with an integral electronic anti-handling device and programmable self-destruct fuze was also produced. The mine is found in Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Burma and the Western Sahara.

It follows the story of a man who settles and lives in rural Norway. First published in 1917, it has since been translated from Norwegian into languages such as English. The novel was written in the popular style of Norwegian new realism, a movement dominating the early 20th century. The novel exemplified Hamsun's aversion to modernity and inclination towards primitivism and the agrarian lifestyle. The novel employed literary techniques new to the time such as stream of consciousness. Hamsun tended to stress the relationship between his characters and the natural environment. Growth of the Soil portrays the protagonist (Isak) and his family as awed by modernity, yet at times, they come into conflict with it. The novel contains two sections entitled Book One and Book Two. The first book focuses almost solely on the story of Isak and his family and the second book starts off by following the plight of Axel and ends mainly focusing on Isak's family. Plot =Book One= The novel begins by following the story of Isak, a Norwegian man, who finally settled upon a patch of land which he deemed fit for farming. He began creating earthen sheds in which he housed several goats obtained from the village yonder. Isak asked passing by Lapps, nomadic indigenous people, to tell women that he is in need of help on his farm. Eventually, a “big, brown-eyed girl, full-built and coarse” with a harelip named Inger, arrived at the house and settled in. Inger had her first child which was a son named Eleseus. She then had another son named Sivert. The Lensmand Geissler came by their farm one day informing them that they were on States land and assisting them in purchasing it. They named the farm Sellanraa. Soon after, Geissler was discharged from his position as Lensmand after a sharp reprimand from his superior and was subsequently replaced with Lensmand Heyerdahl. One day while Isak had left the farm to sell a bull in the village, Inger gave birth to a child and had killed it upon seeing that it had a harelip and would undergo the inevitable suffering in life she herself had experienced. One day, Oline, Inger's relative, visited the farm and figured out that Inger had killed a child. The news of the infanticide now spreading. One October day, the Lensmand and a man showed up at their doorstep to investigate and find evidence pertaining to the crime. Oline had agreed to serve at the farm while Inger was serving her eight-year sentence in prison. Geissler returned one day, interested in prospective copper mining grounds near Sellanraa. Apparently, Geissler did not come to the farm just for the ore, but he also intended on planning to have Inger released from prison as soon as possible. Brede Olsen, the Lensmand's assistant, had now settled on the land halfway between Sellanraa and the village. The farm of his was named Breidablik. One day, people came out to mark the route for a telegraph line that was to run near Isak's farm. Meanwhile, Inger had given birth to another baby girl, Leopoldine, at the prison. The following day, Geissler returned to Sellanraa. He first addressed the matter of the copper tract. He purchased the land for 200 daler from Isak, money unheard of to him until this day. Geissler also spoke of Inger and how he submitted a report to the King and the Governor regarding the case asking for her release. Inger was to be released early. Isak was stupefied by the generosity of Geissler. Isak drove down to the village to meet Inger. Great changes had occurred while Inger was away. No longer had she the harelip but merely a scar on her face. And now she was with the daughter Isak had not yet met, Leopoldine. When one of the telegraph engineers stopped at Isak's house, a job was offered to Eleseus to work under his care in the village. Eleseus went to work in town. A new settler arrived in between Sellanraa and Breidablik, his name was Axel Ström. He named his farm Maaneland. Axel Ström was offered by Brede to have his daughter Barbro assist him at his place. Inger once again gave birth to a daughter named Rebecca. When Oline arrived one day, she told the family that Uncle Sivert, the one who Sivert was named after, had fallen terribly ill. It was agreed upon that Sivert was to inherit the big fortune which his uncle was to leave behind. Eventually, Uncle Sivert died and later, the fortune was to be determined. Geissler and a few prospective mining buyers arrived at the farm by horse one day. Geissler acted as Isak's advocate and sold the section of Isak's land for four thousand Kroner. Isak marvels at how much Geissler has assisted him in making money. News arrived that Breidablik was going to be sold. The real reason Brede was selling his place was because there were some money issues associated with the banks and stores at the village, but they made it seem as though he was selling the place on his own freewill in order to avoid disgrace. The last part of Book One tells of Isak obtaining another wonder for his farm, this time, a mowing machine. He attempts to assemble it but fails and requires Eleseus’ reading skills to help him fix it. People from all over assemble to witness this luxury in use. =Book Two= After the officials went through the financial books, it was discovered to the shock of the family that Uncle Sivert had nothing left of his fortune. Isak went to the auction of Breidablik. Axel, to the surprise of everyone, had purchased the farm. When asked, he said that he was buying it on someone else's behalf. Meanwhile, Eleseus had left the farm and headed back to town for a job which was no longer available for him. On the third of September, Axel could not find Barbro anywhere. He searched around and eventually finds her on the banks of a stream. He wonders what has happened the child Barbro was pregnant with. According to her, she had been near the stream collecting juniper twigs for cleaning buckets when suddenly, she slipped into the river at the same time she was to give birth. It was too late as the baby had already succumbed to drowning. Axel went to look for the infant and found it under a heap of moss and twigs wrapped in a cloth. He ran home for a shovel to bury the body properly. Axel and Barbro argued as she continued to claim that the baby drowned when she accidentally slipped into the water. Barbro, in the heat of the argument, confessed that she had once killed another baby and threw it off a boat. That winter, Barbro went to the village to visit the dentist. Axel had no faith in her returning and as he predicted, she had gone to Bergen, another large city, to stay. One day, Axel was going out to the forest to fell some trees when he sees Brede going up the hill, most likely on an errand to fix something relating to the telegraph line. Axel started chopping down a tree when suddenly, his foot slipped into a cleft in a stone and the tree came crashing down on him. There was a blizzard that day and night was setting in. Axel struggled for hours trying to free himself but was not able to reach for the axe lying on the ground to cut his way out. Axel yelled to Brede hoping that he would be returning from his errand soon. Surely enough, after a few hours, Brede came by but simply ignored him pretending that he was unaware of the situation. He walked on and left Axel to die. When all hope was lost, Oline found Axel. She freed him and helped him return home. On their way back, they encountered Brede who claimed that when he encountered Axel on the ground, he showed no signs of needing help or that anything was wrong. Next day, the news reported that there was a new settler arriving below Maaneland. He was apparently very rich and was going to open a store at the location. His name was Aronson and he called his place Storborg. Spring arrived and engineers and workmen from Sweden began work on the mine. Storborg was prospering with all of these workers buying things at his trading post. The work on the mine continues but there was news that the yield of ore was not as good as promised. As expected, the commotion at the mine started to subside and workers were being dismissed. Now that the mine had been deemed fruitless, the engineer wanted to purchase the land south of the water owned by Geissler. Geissler anticipated that this would happen and so he offered the land at an exorbitant price showing that he had nothing to lose if they did not want to buy it. Eventually, the ordeal with Barbro was discovered and she was arrested in Bergen, the village where she was staying. Now the time had come for Barbro and Axel's trial to take place. Amazingly, the Lensmand's wife, Fru Heyerdahl, had stepped up for Barbro by giving a great, eloquent speech that moved everyone. The jury was obviously affected by this speech and Barbro and Axel were fully pardoned. Fru Heyerdahl had then gotten Barbro to come work for her. Meanwhile, Aronsen was furious that Geissler was refusing to sell his tract of land to the mining company. His trading business depended on a lot of foot traffic but since there was no more, there were no more customers. Geissler was taking revenge on the village for removing him as Lensmand. The entire fate and economy of the district hinged on whether he would sell the land. Eventually, Aronsen, not able to handle it anymore, sold his place to Eleseus who decided that he become a farmer. Geissler had finally sold his land and the mine was operational again. Later, Aronsen returned to buy back the farm from Eleseus but to no avail. Barbro was evicted from Fru Heyerdahl's house after an argument in which Fru discovered that Barbro was often sneaking out to celebrations when she was supposed to be working. Fru was outraged that this was what she got after saving Barbro from the clutches of the law. Barbro daringly returned to Axel but unfortunately, Oline had taken her place in the household while she was away. Oline really does not want to leave the place and asked Axel to call for the doctor as she was not feeling well one night. She criticizes them for trying to evict such a poor, ill woman. Oline had died that night. When Eleseus returned home, he talked privately with Sivert telling him his big plans - he was going to start a new life in America. Sivert was shocked and advised his brother not to go but seeing that this was futile, he gave him 25 kroner for his journey. Eleseus left that day on a boat and never came back. What was once barren land is now rich of settlers, all started from the one pioneer Isak. Characters =Isak= Isak, the protagonist of the novel, is described as a \\"strong, course fellow, with a red iron beard, and little scars on face and hands\\". He is the first settler on the Almenning near the village. He is the husband of Inger and father of Eleseus, Sivert, Leopoldine, and Rebecca. The character of Isak conforms to Hamsun's ideal individual: hard working, with a large family, and averted to modernity but rather finding roots with the agrarian lifestyle. Isak is often portrayed as very simple. He has no education and is unable to read well or write. Isak is a pioneer of the land, starting a farm and family from virtually nothing, a trait which Hamsun admired in individuals. There are several moments when Hamsun reveals Isak's crude and violent side, such as when he slams his wife Inger to the floor when he sees her flirting with a telegraph worker. Isak is admired by many, his farm is very developed compared to his neighbors. He has many sheds, fancy tools such as gift from Geissler and a mining operator, good land, an advanced irrigation system, and more things which gains him the admiration of many. =Inger= Inger is the wife of Isak described as being \\"a big, brown-eyed girl, full built and coarse, with good, heavy hands, and rough hide brogues on her feet as if she had been a Lapp...\\" She is the mother of Eleseus, Sivert, Leopoldine, and Rebecca and another child whom she had killed. Inger had a harelip until it was surgically repaired when she was in prison serving her sentence for committing infanticide. After the birth of her two boys: Eleseus and Sivert, she bore a daughter who had also had a harelip. Knowing how tough her life would be, she killed it. People soon realized that something had happened to her pregnancy and the body of the child was discovered buried in the forest. She was sentenced to eight years in prison out of a maximum sentence of life. While in prison, Inger had a positive experience. She learned how to knit, do various needlework, read, write, and do other things. Hamsun described Inger as being quite ugly, unrefined, and unintelligent. She is always amazed at everything which Isak does. Whenever he purchases something at the village, Inger marvels at it. After her time at the prison though, she had experience some modernity and no longer was as awed by the things which Isak did. =Isak's Children= Isak had four children: Eleseus, Sivert, Leopoldine, and Rebecca. There was also one child that was killed just after birth by Inger. The eldest child is a boy named Eleseus. He represents the intellectual of the family. Eleseus was offered a job in the village by a man where he learned many academic skills which are foreign to the rest of his family. His parents frequently sent him money which he would spend frivolously thus angering them. Upon returning home for a vacation, his position at his former job was lost. While staying at the farm again, it is evident that Eleseus is weak compared to his brother and isn't a physical worker. After much consideration, Eleseus purchased Aronsens' home with Isak's money. He stayed for a while but after realizing that he no longer wanted that lifestyle, set off to America never to be seen again. Sivert, the second eldest son, is a strong, hard-working person. He is similar to his father in terms of strength. Sivert is named after his uncle who was supposed to leave his nephew most of his supposedly large fortune, which amounted to nothing at his death. Leopoldine is one of the daughters which Inger bore while she was serving her prison sentence for committing infanticide. Rebecca is the youngest daughter who was born afterwards. =Geissler= Geissler is the ex-Lensmand of the village. He was a great friend of Isak and helped him sell his land, release Inger from prison, and give advice on selling the mine. Geissler was replaced by Lensmand Heyerdahl after a sharp reprimand from his superior. Isak admired Geissler and was always excited when he came by. Geissler would often be doing big business with other people and travelling but towards the end of the novel, he was seemingly becoming worn out and out of health. As the plot progresses Geissler becomes antagonistic as his personal business begins negatively affecting the lives and businesses of the township. =Isak's neighbours= Isak's neighbours are Brede Olsen, Aronsen, Axel Strom and Barbro. The first neighbour to settle near Isak was Brede Olsen of the farm Breidablik. He was scatterbrained and unable to look after a farm properly. Evidence of neglect of Brede's tools were seen as Isak passed used to by his farm to go to the village. Brede's place was eventually sold because of outstanding charges with the banks in the villages. They allowed Brede to make it seem like he was selling Breidablik out of his own will to avoid unnecessary embarrassment. Breidablik was purchased by Axel Strom who bought it for his brother. Axel Strom was the owner of Maaneland. He was not proficient at farming as Isak was but received help from Barbro, Brede's daughter, who went to work for him. Aronsen was another very rich settler who set up a store in order to make profit from the many miners who would be in the area working on the mine near Sellanraa (Isak's farm). His place was named Storborg. Seeing that there was no more business as they were leaving due to a failure of yield, Aronsen sold his place to Eleseus, Isak's son. Major themes Hamsun's protagonists were often outcasts and vagabonds that opposed civilization, industrialization, and modernisation. These rootless individuals who distrusted organized society were a reflection of Hamsun himself. The novel “Growth of the Soil” expresses back-to-nature, old-school philosophies, and peasant life. His works set simple agrarian values against those of industrial society, showing a deep aversion to civilization proving that people's fulfillment lies with the soil. The novel showed Hamsun's favour of primitivism and aversion to modernity. He opposed naturalism and realism and wanted “modern literature to represent the complex intricacies of human mind”. Hamsun believed that the true nature of an individual could only be revealed through a subjective and irrational approach. Hamsun's political beliefs and ideologies were often expressed in his books, especially Growth of the Soil.\\"Knut Hamsun - Biographical\\". Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 15 Apr 2016. The character Isak conforms to Hamsun's vision of an ideal individual. He has little connection with industrialized society or modernity, and when he does, it usually is in a negative light. For example, when he was informed that he was needing to purchase the farms land from the State, Isak was confused as this had never crossed his mind. Luckily for him, the cost was mild thanks to Lensmand Geissler's generosity. Isak was a pioneer of the soil, he started with nothing and built a great farm out of it. The theme of hard work yielding results was evident throughout the book with Isak as an example.\\" Knut Hamsun.\\" 2012. FamousAuthors.org 15 April, http://www.famousauthors.org/knut-hamsun Style The novel is written in the style of Norwegian new realism, a literary movement which was used in Hamsun's later novels. This style was common during the first half of the 20th century in Norwegian literature. Hamsun utilized techniques fairly new to the time such as stream of consciousness or interior monologue.\\" Knut Hamsun.\\" 2012. FamousAuthors.org 15 April, http://www.famousauthors.org/knut-hamsun Reception Growth of the Soil is regarded as a historical classic. It has been acclaimed by many and won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920. Hamsun's support of the German occupation of Norway has drawn a lot controversy and many refuse to acknowledge his success as a writer in light of that. William Worster, in an afterword to his 1920 translation of Growth of the Soil, describes the novel as follows: Film adaptation Growth of the Soil is a 1921 Norwegian silent film based on Hamsun's Growth of the Soil by the Norrøna Film company with an orchestral accompaniment composed by Leif Halvorsen. It was directed by Gunnar Sommerfeldt who also wrote the script and played the role of Lensmand Geissler. The original film was 107 minutes long and cost about 240,000 kroner to make, a very considerable sum of money at the time. It was filmed at Rana, Norway. The film cast stars Amund Rydland as Isak, Karen Poulsen as Inger, Ragna Wettergreen as Oline (Inger's relative), and Gunnar Sommerfeldt as Geissler. The chief photographer was George Schnéevoigt. Nobel Prize The novel Growth of the Soil was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920.

This form of architectural decoration is common in Indo-Islamic architecture and more generally in Islamic architecture.Lerner, p. 156 The jali helps in lowering the temperature by compressing the air through the holes. Also when the air passes through these openings, its velocity increases giving profound diffusion. It has been observed that humid areas like Kerala and Konkan have larger holes with overall lower opacity than compared with the dry climate regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan. With compactness of the residential areas in the modern India, jalis became less frequent for privacy and security matters.  History  Early jali work was built by carving into stone, generally in geometric patterns, while later the Mughals used very finely carved plant-based designs, as at the Taj Mahal.

Andrew Lang included it in The Blue Fairy Book. Synopsis A widowed queen spoiled her only daughter, who was so beautiful that kings vied for the honor of her hand, not believing they could attain it. Uneasy that her daughter would never marry, the queen went to visit the Fairy of the Desert for advice. She made a cake to protect herself from the lions that guarded the fairy, but she lost it. A yellow dwarf offered to save her in return for her daughter's hand. She accepted, but when the dwarf showed the miserable home in which her daughter would live, she grew quite ill. Her daughter, distressed, went to seek the same fairy. The dwarf told her what her mother had promised, and when she was ready to reject it, the lions arrived. She agreed if he would save her. Back at the castle, she fell quite ill and agreed to marry the King of the Gold Mines. However, at the wedding, the Fairy of the Desert and the Yellow Dwarf interrupted. The dwarf carried off the princess, and the fairy fell in love with the king and carried him off. She chained him in a cave and turned herself into a beautiful woman, but her feet being unchanged, the king was able to tell who she was. He told her that he would hate the fairy as long as she kept him chained up, but would love her if she freed him. The Fairy of the Desert freed him and brought him to her castle, carrying him by the castle where the princess lived; she saw them and became convinced that the king was unfaithful to her. The king was kept more pleasantly, but was unable to escape. He lamented his fate along the sea, and a mermaid left enchanted sea rushes behind to look like his body and freed him. She gave him a sword to fight his way to the princess. The fairy was entirely deceived by the sea rushes and did not pursue him. The king fought his way through sphinxes and dragons to find his path blocked by maidens with garlands of flowers; he still pressed on, tearing apart their garlands, and reached the princess. He persuaded her of his fidelity, but the Yellow Dwarf found them and killed him. The princess died of grief. The mermaid was only able to change their bodies to two palm trees.

Scholars have portrayed it as a cohesive force, a common set of values that foster social and cultural integration. The ritualistic elements of ceremonial deism found in American ceremonies and presidential invocations of God can be seen as expressions of the American civil religion. The very heavy emphasis on pan-Christian religious themes is quite distinctively American and the theory is designed to explain this. The concept goes back to the 19th century, but in current form, the theory was developed by sociologist Robert Bellah in 1967 in his article, \\"Civil Religion in America\\". The topic soon became the major focus at religious sociology conferences and numerous articles and books were written on the subject. The debate reached its peak with the American Bicentennial celebration in 1976. From the issue entitled \\"Religion in America\\". There is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the document of the United States Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, as cornerstones of a type of civic or civil religion or political religion. Political sociologist Anthony Squiers argues that these texts act as the sacred writ of the American civil religion because they are used as authoritative symbols in what he calls the politics of the sacred. The politics of the sacred, according to Squiers are \\"the attempt to define and dictate what is in accord with the civil religious sacred and what is not. It is a battle to define what can and cannot be and what should and should not be tolerated and accepted in the community, based on its relation to that which is sacred for that community.\\"Squiers, A. (2018). The Politics of the Sacred in America: The Role of Civil Religion in Political Practice. New York: Springer. p. 20. . According to Bellah, Americans embrace a common \\"civil religion\\" with certain fundamental beliefs, values, holidays, and rituals, parallel to, or independent of, their chosen religion. Presidents have often served in central roles in civil religion, and the nation provides quasi- religious honors to its martyrs—such as Abraham Lincoln and the soldiers killed in the American Civil War.Harry S. Stout, Upon the Altar of the Nation: A Moral History of the Civil War (2006) Historians have noted presidential level use of civil religion rhetoric in profoundly moving episodes such as World War II, the Civil Rights Movement, and the September 11th attacks. In a survey of more than fifty years of American civil religion scholarship, Squiers identifies fourteen principal tenets of the American civil religion: # Filial piety # Reverence to certain sacred texts and symbols such as The Constitution, The Declaration of Independence, and the flag # The sanctity of American institutions # The belief in God or a deity # The idea that rights are divinely given # The notion that freedom comes from God through government # Governmental authority comes from God or a higher transcendent authority # The conviction that God can be known through the American experience # God is the supreme judge # God is sovereign # America's prosperity results from God's providence # America is a \\"city on a hill\\" or a beacon of hope and righteousness # The principle of sacrificial death and rebirth # America serves a higher purpose than self-interests In an examination of more than fifty years of political discourse, Squiers finds that filial piety, reference to certain sacred texts and symbols of the American civil religion, the belief in God or a deity, America is a \\"city on a hill\\" or a beacon of hope and righteousness, and America serves a higher purpose than self-interests are the most frequently referenced. He further found that there are no statistically significant differences in the amount of American civil religious language between Democrats and Republicans, incumbents and non-incumbents nor Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates.Squiers, A. (2018). The Politics of the Sacred in America: The Role of Civil Religion in Political Practice. New York: Springer. p. 51-74. . This belief system has historically been used to reject nonconformist ideas and groups. Theorists such as Bellah hold that American civil religion can perform the religious functions of integration, legitimation, and prophecy, while other theorists, such as Richard Fenn, disagree.Gail Gehrig, \\"The American Civil Religion Debate: A Source for Theory Construction,\\" Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, (March 1981) 20#1 pp. 51–63 in JSTOR Development Alexis de Tocqueville believed that Christianity was the source of the basic principles of liberal democracy, and the only religion capable of maintaining liberty in a democratic era. He was keenly aware of the mutual hatred between Christians and liberals in 19th- century France, rooted in the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. In France, Christianity was allied with the Old Regime before 1789 and the reactionary Bourbon Restoration of 1815-30. However he said Christianity was not antagonistic to democracy in the United States, where it was a bulwark against dangerous tendencies toward individualism and materialism, which would lead to atheism and tyranny.Sanford Kessler, \\"Tocqueville on Civil Religion and Liberal Democracy,\\" Journal of Politics, 39#1 (1977), pp. 119–46 in JSTOR Also important were the contributions of French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) and French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). =The American case= Most students of American civil religion follow the basic Bellah/Durkheimian interpretation.Marcela Cristi, From civil to political religion: the intersection of culture, religion and politics (2001) p. 7 Other sources of this idea include philosopher John Dewey who spoke of \\"common faith\\" (1934); sociologist Robin Murphy Williams' American Society: A Sociological Interpretation (1951) which stated there was a \\"common religion\\" in America; sociologist Lloyd Warner's analysis of the Memorial Day celebrations in \\"Yankee City\\" (1953 [1974]); historian Martin Marty's \\"religion in general\\" (1959); theologian Will Herberg who spoke of \\"the American Way of Life\\" (1960, 1974); historian Sidney Mead's \\"religion of the Republic\\" (1963); and British writer G. K. Chesterton, who said that the United States was \\"the only nation ... founded on a creed\\" and also coined the phrase \\"a nation with a soul of a church\\". In the same period, several distinguished historians such as Yehoshua Arieli, Daniel Boorstin, and Ralph Gabriel \\"assessed the religious dimension of 'nationalism', the 'American creed', 'cultural religion' and the 'democratic faith'\\". Premier sociologist Seymour Lipset (1963) referred to \\"Americanism\\" and the \\"American Creed\\" to characterize a distinct set of values that Americans hold with a quasi- religious fervor. Today, according to social scientist Ronald Wimberley and William Swatos, there seems to be a firm consensus among social scientists that there is a part of Americanism that is especially religious in nature, which may be termed civil religion. But this religious nature is less significant than the \\"transcendent universal religion of the nation\\" which late eighteenth century French intellectuals such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about. =Evidence supporting Bellah= Ronald Wimberley (1976) and other researchers collected large surveys and factor analytic studies which gave support to Bellah's argument that civil religion is a distinct cultural phenomenon within American society which is not embodied in American politics or denominational religion. Examples of civil religious beliefs are reflected in statements used in the research such as the following: * \\"America is God's chosen nation today.\\" * \\"A president's authority ... is from God.\\" * \\"Social justice cannot only be based on laws; it must also come from religion.\\" * \\"God can be known through the experiences of the American people.\\" * \\"Holidays like the Fourth of July are religious as well as patriotic.\\" * \\"God Bless America\\" Later research sought to determine who is civil religious. In a 1978 study by James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley, the researchers found that a wide cross section of American citizens have civil religious beliefs. In general though, college graduates and political or religious liberals appear to be somewhat less civil religious. Protestants and Catholics have the same level of civil religiosity. Religions that were created in the United States, the Latter Day Saints movement, Adventists, and Pentecostals, have the highest civil religiosity. Jews, Unitarians and those with no religious preference have the lowest civil religion. Even though there is variation in the scores, the \\"great majority\\" of Americans are found to share the types of civil religious beliefs which Bellah wrote about. Further research found that civil religion plays a role in people's preferences for political candidates and policy positions. In 1980 Ronald Wimberley found that civil religious beliefs were more important than loyalties to a political party in predicting support for Nixon over McGovern with a sample of Sunday morning church goers who were surveyed near the election date and a general group of residents in the same community. In 1982 James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley found that civil religion was second only to occupation in predicting a person's political policy views. Coleman has argued that civil religion is a widespread theme in history. He says it typically evolves in three phases: undifferentiation, state sponsorship in the period of modernization, differentiation. He supports his argument with comparative historical data from Japan, Imperial Rome, the Soviet Union, Turkey, France and the United States.John A. Coleman, \\"Civil Religion,\\" Sociological Analysis, Summer 1970, 31#2 pp. 67–77 In practice =American Revolution= The American Revolution is the main source of civil religion. The book Sons of the Fathers: The Civil Religion of the American Revolution says it produced these religious properties: a Moses-like leader in George Washington; prophets such as Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine; apostles such as John Adams and Benjamin Franklin; martyrs such as at the Boston Massacre and in Nathan Hale; devils such as Benedict Arnold; sacred places such as Independence Hall and Valley Forge; rituals such as raising the Liberty Tree; symbols such as the Betsy Ross flag; sacred holidays such as Independence Day; and a holy scripture based on The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. =Ceremonies in the early Republic= The Apotheosis of Washington, as seen looking up from the capitol rotunda The elitists who ran the Federalist Party were conscious of the need to boost voter identification with their party. Elections remained of central importance but for the rest of the political year celebrations, parades, festivals, and visual sensationalism were used. They employed multiple festivities, exciting parades, and even quasi-religious pilgrimages and \\"sacred\\" days that became incorporated into the American civil religion. George Washington was always its hero, and after his death he became a sort of demigod looking down from heaven to instill his blessings on the party.John Ferling, The ascent of George Washington: The hidden political genius of an American Icon (2010). At first the Federalists focused on commemoration of the ratification of the Constitution; they organized parades to demonstrate widespread popular support for the new Federalist Party. The parade organizers, incorporated secular versions of traditional religious themes and rituals, thereby fostering a highly visible celebration of the nation's new civil religion.Jürgen Heideking, \\"The federal processions of 1788 and the origins of American civil religion.\\" Soundings (1994): 367–87. in JSTOR The Fourth of July became a semi-sacred day—a status it maintains in the 21st century. Its celebration in Boston proclaimed national over local patriotism, and included orations, dinners, militia musters, parades, marching bands, floats and fireworks. By 1800, the Fourth was closely identified with the Federalist party. Republicans were annoyed, and stage their own celebrations on the fourth—with rival parades sometimes clashing with each other. That generated even more excitement and larger crowds. After the collapse of the Federalists starting in 1815, the Fourth became a nonpartisan holiday.Len Travers, \\"Hurrah for the Fourth: Patriotism, Politics, and Independence Day in Federalist Boston, 1783–1818.\\" Essex Institute Historical Collections 125: 129–61.Kevin Coe, et al. The Rhetoric of American Civil Religion: Symbols, Sinners, and Saints (Lexington Books, 2016). =President as religious leader= Since the days of George Washington presidents have assumed one of several roles in American civil religion, and that role has helped shape the presidency.Richard G., Hutcheson, Jr., God in the White House: How Religion Has Changed the Modern Presidency (1988)James David Fairbanks, \\"The Priestly Functions of the Presidency: A Discussion of the Literature on Civil Religion and Its Implications for the Study of Presidential Leadership,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly (1981) 11:214–32. Linder argues that: Charles W. Calhoun argues that in the 1880s the speeches of Benjamin Harrison display a rhetorical style that embraced American civic religion; indeed, Harrison was one of the credo's most adept presidential practitioners. Harrison was a leader whose application of Christian ethics to social and economic matters paved the way for the Social Gospel, the Progressive Movement and a national climate of acceptance regarding government action to resolve social problems.Charles W. Calhoun, \\"Civil religion and the gilded age presidency: The case of Benjamin Harrison,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly, Fall 1993, 23#4 pp. 651–67 Linder argues that President Bill Clinton's sense of civil religion was based on his Baptist background in Arkansas. Commentator William Safire noted of the 1992 presidential campaign that, \\"Never has the name of God been so frequently invoked, and never has this or any nation been so thoroughly and systematically blessed.\\"Barry A. Kosmin and Seymour Lachman, One Nation Under God: Religion in Contemporary American Society (1994) p. 158 Clinton speeches incorporated religious terminology that suggests the role of pastor rather than prophet or priest. With a universalistic outlook, he made no sharp distinction between the domestic and the foreign in presenting his vision of a world community of civil faith. Brocker argues that Europeans have often mischaracterized the politics of President George W. Bush (2001–2009) as directly inspired by Protestant fundamentalism. However, in his speeches Bush mostly actually used civil religious metaphors and images and rarely used language specific to any Christian denomination. His foreign policy, says Bocker, was based on American security interests and not on any fundamentalist teachings.Manfred Brocker, \\"Civil Religion, Fundamentalism, and the Politics and Policies of George W. Bush,\\" Journal of Political Science, Jan 2004, Vol. 32, pp. 95–124 Hammer says that in his 2008 campaign speeches candidate Barack Obama portrays the American nation as a people unified by a shared belief in the American Creed and sanctified by the symbolism of an American civil religion.Stefanie. Hammer, \\"The role of narrative in political campaigning: An analysis of speeches by Barack Obama,\\" National Identities, Sept 2010, 12#3, pp. 269–90 Would-be presidents likewise contributed to the rhetorical history of civil religion. The speeches of Daniel Webster were often memorized by student debaters, and his 1830 endorsement of \\"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable\\" was iconic.Craig R. Smith, Daniel Webster and the Oratory of Civil Religion (2005) p. 117 =Symbolism of the American flag= According to Adam Goodheart, the modern meaning of the American flag, and the reverence of many Americans towards it, was forged by Major Robert Anderson's fight in defense of the flag at the Battle of Fort Sumter, which opened the American Civil War in April 1861. During the war the flag was used throughout the Union to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism. Goodheart explains the flag was transformed into a sacred symbol of patriotism: =Soldiers and veterans= An important dimension is the role of the soldiers, ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. They are memorialized in many monuments and semi-sacred days, such as Veterans Day and Memorial Day. Historian Jonathan Ebel argues that the \\"soldier-savior\\" is a sort of Messiah, who embodies the synthesis of civil religion, and the Christian ideals of sacrifice and redemption.Jonathan H. Ebel, G.I. Messiahs: Soldiering, War, and American Civil Religion (2015) p. 7 In Europe, there are numerous cemeteries exclusively for American soldiers who fought in world wars. They have become American sacred spaces.Jonathan H. Ebel, \\"Overseas military cemeteries As american sacred space: mine eyes have seen la gloire.\\" Material Religion 8#2 (2012): 183–214. Pacifists have made some sharp criticisms. For example, Kelly Denton-Borhaug, writing from the Moravian peace tradition,Kelly Denton-Borhaug, \\"Sharing Peace: Mennonites and Catholics in Conversation eds. by Gerald W. Schlabach and Margaret Pfeil,\\" American Catholic Studies 125#2 (2014): 82–83. argues that the theme of \\"sacrifice\\" has fueled the rise of what she calls \\"U.S. war culture.\\" The result is a diversion of attention from what she considers the militarism and the immoral, oppressive, sometimes barbaric conduct in the global American war on terror.Kelly Denton-Borhaug, U.S. War-Culture, Sacrifice and Salvation (2011) pp. 1–4. However, some Protestant denominations such as the Churches of Christ, have largely turned away from pacifism to give greater support to patriotism and civil religion.Michael W. Casey, \\"From Pacifism to Patriotism: The Emergence of Civil Religion in the Churches of Christ During World War I.\\" Mennonite Quarterly Review 66#3 (1992): 376–90. =Pledge of Allegiance= Kao and Copulsky argue the concept of civil religion illuminates the popular constitutional debate over the Pledge of Allegiance. The function of the pledge has four aspects: preservationist, pluralist, priestly, and prophetic. The debate is not between those who believe in God and those who do not, but it is a dispute on the meaning and place of civil religion in America.Grace Y. Kao and Jerome E. Copulsky, \\"The Pledge of Allegiance and the Meanings and Limits of Civil Religion,\\" Journal of the American Academy of Religion, March 2007, 75#1, pp. 121–49 Cloud explores political oaths since 1787 and traces the tension between a need for national unity and a desire to affirm religious faith. He reviews major Supreme Court decisions involving the Pledge of Allegiance, including the contradictory Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940) and West Virginia v. Barnette (1943) decisions. He argues that the Pledge was changed in 1954 during the Cold War to encourage school children to reject communism's atheistic philosophy by affirming belief in God.Matthew W. Cloud, \\"'One Nation, Under God': Tolerable Acknowledgement of Religion or Unconstitutional Cold War Propaganda Cloaked in American Civil Religion?\\" Journal of Church and State, Spring 2004, 46#2 pp. 311–40, online =School rituals= Adam Gamoran (1990) argues that civil religion in public schools can be seen in such daily rituals as the pledge of allegiance; in holiday observances, with activities such as music and art; and in the social studies, history and English curricula. Civil religion in schools plays a dual role: it socializes youth to a common set of understandings, but it also sets off subgroups of Americans whose backgrounds or beliefs prevent them from participating fully in civil religious ceremonies.Adam Gamoran, \\"Civil Religion in American Schools,\\" SA: Sociological Analysis, Fall 1990, 51#3 pp. 235–56 =Ethnic minorities= The Bellah argument deals with mainstream beliefs, but other scholars have looked at minorities outside the mainstream, and typically distrusted or disparaged by the mainstream, which have developed their own version of U.S. civil religion. White Southerners Wilson, noting the historic centrality of religion in Southern identity, argues that when the White South was outside the national mainstream in the late 19th century, it created its own pervasive common civil religion heavy with mythology, ritual, and organization. Wilson says the \\"Lost Cause\\"—that is, defeat in a holy war—has left some southerners to face guilt, doubt, and the triumph of what they perceive as evil: in other words, to form a tragic sense of life.Charles Reagan Wilson, \\"The Religion of the Lost Cause: Ritual and the Organization of the Southern Civil Religion, 1865–1920,\\" Journal of Southern History, May 1980, 46#2 pp. 219–38Charles Reagan Wilson, Baptized in Blood: The Religion of the Lost Cause, 1865–1920 (1980) Black and African Americans Woodrum and Bell argue that black people demonstrate less civil religiosity than white people and that different predictors of civil religion operate among black and white people. For example, conventional religion positively influences white people's civil religion but negatively influences black peoples' civil religion. Woodrum and Bell interpret these results as a product of black American religious ethnogenesis and separatism.Eric Woodrum, and Arnold Bell, \\"Race, Politics, and Religion in Civil Religion Among Blacks,\\" SA: Sociological Analysis, Winter 1989, 49#4 pp. 353–67 Japanese Americans Iwamura argues that the pilgrimages made by Japanese Americans to the sites of World War II-era internment camps have formed a Japanese American version of civil religion. Starting in 1969 the Reverend Sentoku Maeda and Reverend Soichi Wakahiro began pilgrimages to Manzanar National Historic Site in California. These pilgrimages included poetry readings, music, cultural events, a roll call of former internees, and a nondenominational ceremony with Protestant and Buddhist ministers and Catholic and Shinto priests. The event is designed to reinforce Japanese American cultural ties and to ensure that such injustices will never occur again.Jane Naomi Iwamura, \\"Critical Faith: Japanese Americans and the Birth of a New Civil Religion,\\" American Quarterly, Sept 2007, 59#3, pp. 937–968, in Project MUSE Hispanic and Latino Americans Mexican-American labor leader César Chávez, by virtue of having holidays, stamps, and other commemorations of his actions, has practically become a \\"saint\\" in American civil religion, according to León. He was raised in the Catholic tradition and using Catholic rhetoric. His \\"sacred acts,\\" his political practices couched in Christian teachings, became influential to the burgeoning Chicano movement and strengthened his appeal. By acting on his moral convictions through nonviolent means, Chávez became sanctified in the national consciousness, says León.Luis D. León, \\"Cesar Chavez in American Religious Politics: Mapping the New Global Spiritual Line.\\" American Quarterly, Sep 2007, 59#3 pp. 857–81, Enshrined texts The National Archives Building in Washington, DC. Christian language, rhetoric, and values helped colonists to perceive their political system as superior to the corrupt British monarchy. Ministers' sermons were instrumental in promoting patriotism and in motivating the colonists to take action against the evils and corruption of the British government. Together with the semi- religious tone sometimes adopted by preachers and such leaders as George Washington,Gary Scott Smith, \\"The American Moses,\\" Christian History and Biography, Summer 2008, Issue 99, pp. 8–13 and the notion that God favored the patriot cause, this made the documents of the Founding Fathers suitable as almost-sacred texts.Thomas S. Kidd, God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution (2010) pp. 4, 37, 59, 112, 115, The National Archives Building in Washington preserves and displays the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Pauline Maier describes these texts as enshrined in massive, bronze-framed display cases.Gordon S. Wood, \\"Dusting off the Declaration,\\" The New York Review of Books, Aug 14, 1997 While political scientists, sociologists, and legal scholars study the Constitution and how it is used in American society, on the other hand, historians are concerned with putting themselves back into a time and place, in context. It would be anachronistic for them to look at the documents of the \\"Charters of Freedom\\" and see America's modern \\"civic religion\\" because of \\"how much Americans have transformed very secular and temporal documents into sacred scriptures\\". The whole business of erecting a shrine for the worship of the Declaration of Independence strikes some academic critics looking from point of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as \\"idolatrous, and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution.\\" It was suspicious of religious iconographic practices. At the beginning, in 1776, it was not meant to be that at all.Wood, Gordon S., op.cit., Aug 14, 1997 On the 1782 Great Seal of the United States, the date of the Declaration of Independence and the words under it signify the beginning of the \\"new American Era\\" on earth. Though the inscription, Novus ordo seclorum, does not translate from the Latin as \\"secular\\", it also does not refer to a new order of heaven. It is a reference to generations of society in the western hemisphere, the millions of generations to come.Great Seal webpage. Viewed August 19, 2011. Even from the vantage point of a new nation only ten to twenty years after the drafting of the Constitution, the Framers themselves differed in their assessments of its significance. Washington in his Farewell Address pleaded that \\"the Constitution be sacredly maintained.\\"' He echoed Madison in \\"Federalist No. 49\\" that citizen \\"veneration\\" of the Constitution might generate the intellectual stability needed to maintain even the \\"wisest and freest governments\\" amidst conflicting loyalties. But there is also a rich tradition of dissent from \\"Constitution worship\\". By 1816, Jefferson could write that \\"some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched.\\" But he saw imperfections and imagined that potentially, there could be others, believing as he did that \\"institutions must advance also\\". Regarding the United States Constitution, the position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is that it is a divinely inspired document.See D&C; 101:77–80 =Seventh-Day Adventists= While the civil religion has been widely accepted by practically all denominations, one group has always stood against it. Seventh-Day Adventists deliberately pose as \\"heretics\\", so to speak, and refuse to treat Sundays as special, due to their adherence to the Ten Commandments dictating that Saturday is the holy day. Indeed, says Bull, the denomination has defined its identity in contradistinction to precisely those elements of the host culture that have constituted civil religion.Malcolm Bull, \\"The Seventh-Day Adventists: Heretics of American Civil Religion Sociological Analysis, April 1989, 50#2, pp. 177–87 Making a nation The American identity has an ideological connection to these \\"Charters of Freedom\\". Samuel P. Huntington discusses common connections for most peoples in nation-states, a national identity as product of common ethnicity, ancestry and experience, common language, culture and religion. Levinson argues: The creed, according to Huntington, is made up of (a) individual rights, (b) majority rule, and (c) a constitutional order of limited government power. American independence from Britain was not based on cultural difference, but on the adoption of principles found in the Declaration. Whittle Johnson in The Yale Review sees a sort of \\"covenanting community\\" of freedom under law, which, \\"transcending the 'natural' bonds of race, religion and class, itself takes on transcendent importance\\". Becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States requires passing a test covering a basic understanding of the Declaration, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, and taking an oath to support the U.S. Constitution. Hans Kohn described the United States Constitution as \\"unlike any other: it represents the lifeblood of the American nation, its supreme symbol and manifestation. It is so intimately welded with the national existence itself that the two have become inseparable.\\" Indeed, abolishing the Constitution in Huntington's view would abolish the United States, it would \\"destroy the basis of community, eliminating the nation, [effecting] ... a return to nature.\\" As if to emphasize the lack of any alternative \\"faith\\" to the American nation, Thomas Grey in his article \\"The Constitution as scripture\\", contrasted those traditional societies with divinely appointed rulers enjoying heavenly mandates for social cohesion with that of the United States. He pointed out that Article VI, third clause, requires all political figures, both federal and state, \\"be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution, but no religious test shall ever be required...\\" This was a major break not only with past British practice commingling authority of state and religion, but also with that of most American states when the Constitution was written. Escape clause. Whatever the oversights and evils the modern reader may see in the original Constitution, the Declaration that \\"all men are created equal\\"—in their rights—informed the Constitution in such a way that Frederick Douglass in 1860 could label the Constitution, if properly understood, as an antislavery document. He held that \\"the constitutionality of slavery can be made out only by disregarding the plain and common-sense reading to the Constitution itself. [T]he Constitution will afford slavery no protection when it shall cease to be administered by slaveholders,\\" a reference to the Supreme Court majority at the time. With a change of that majority, there was American precedent for judicial activism in Constitutional interpretation, including the Massachusetts Supreme Court, which had ended slavery there in 1783. Accumulations of Amendments under Article V of the Constitution and judicial review of Congressional and state law have fundamentally altered the relationship between U.S. citizens and their governments. Some scholars refer to the coming of a \\"second Constitution\\": with the Thirteenth Amendment, we are all free; the Fourteenth, we are all citizens; the Fifteenth, men vote; and the Nineteenth, women vote. The Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted so as to require States to respect citizen rights in the same way that the Constitution has required the Federal government to respect them. So much so, that in 1972, the U.S. Representative from Texas, Barbara Jordan, could affirm, \\"My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total...\\". After discussion of the Article V provision for change in the Constitution as a political stimulus to serious national consensus building, Sanford Levinson performed a thought experiment which was suggested at the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution in Philadelphia. If one were to sign the Constitution today,The visitor to the National Archives website today is invited to sign the Constitution online. Viewed September 11, 2011. whatever our reservations might be, knowing what we do now, and transported back in time to its original shortcomings, great and small, \\"signing the Constitution commits one not to closure but only to a process of becoming, and to taking responsibility for the political vision toward which I, joined I hope, with others, strive\\".

Original construction began in 1926, and was completed in 1928. The Broderick was fully renovated in 2012 by JC Beal Construction Inc., and REDICO served as the construction manager. The tower was the second tallest building in Michigan when it was originally completed in 1928. It stands 34-stories, with two basement floors. The building is designed with Neo-classical architecture, Chicago school, and Beaux-Arts designs. Limestone is a prominent material in the building's surface. It was designed by architects Louis Kamper and Paul Kamper for Theodore Eaton. The tower is located at the Southeast corner of Woodward Avenue and Witherell Street, facing Grand Circus Park, and stands across the street from the David Whitney Building. The Broderick Tower is not a square, or even a parallelogram in shape. History Before the decorative cornices were removed, this building was 371'-6\\" to the top of the parapet wall, and 376'-7\\" tall to the very tip of the decorative cornice. This tower is topped by a Beaux-Arts/Neoclassical inspired crown. The tower was originally constructed as the Eaton Tower, named after Theodore Horation Eaton, Jr., an importer and dealer in chemicals and dyes. The building changed ownership and names in 1945, when the tower was purchased by David Broderick, a Detroit insurance broker, which he then renamed after himself. After his purchase of the tower in 1945, David Broderick created the Sky Top Club on the 33rd floor of the tower, which was a private club used for entertaining Mr. Broderick's associates and guests. After David Broderick's death in 1957, the tower changed hands many times between 1963 and 1976, finally ending up in the hands of the Higgins family, which retains a stake in the ownership to this day. A bar called Tavern on the Park was preceded by a restaurant called The Flaming Embers, which also later closed. Another bar called The Pit Stop opened on the ground floor of the building in 2007 but eventually also closed. Currently the Detroit Sports Bar & Grille occupies the street level floor. The memorable humpback whale mural on the rear façade of the building was painted by Metro-Detroit native eco-artist, Wyland, and was dedicated on October 13, 1997. A billboard was placed over the mural in July 2006, covering up the Whaling Wall mural. The money generated from a recently added billboard was announced to benefit the restoration of the building, as the billboard is visible from the nearby Comerica Park, home of the Detroit Tigers. In June 2010, the billboard was removed during a storm, once again revealing the mural. Motown Construction Partners LLC, led by Fred J. Beal, Manager, and President of JC Beal Construction Inc., secured financing for a comprehensive re-development of the Broderick Tower in December 2010. Renovations commenced to create 124 apartments on floors 5-34, three separate restaurant venues floor 1 and the adjacent lower level and mezzanine, and office space on floors 2 through 4.http://www.brodericktower.com, Page 6; \\"Floorplans\\" On November 2, 2012, the Broderick Tower received official certificates of occupancy by the City of Detroit. A call was made to residents by management around 3:30 PM; on that day, at least 5 residents moved in immediately. During that same weekend, at least 50 more residents moved in. , Broderick Tower is 100% leased and occupied.

The incident ended in a failed Israeli rescue attempt, during which Wachsman, three of his captors and an Israeli officer were killed. Background In 1994, Hamas tried to disrupt the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians which it opposed by carrying out a series of suicide bombings.  Abduction  At home on a leave, Wachsman was instructed by the military to attend a one-day training course in northern Israel. He left Saturday night after Shabbat, telling his parents he would return Sunday night, October 9, 1994. He was last seen by a friend who reported that, after completing the training, Wachsman had been dropped off at the Bnei Atarot junction, a densely populated area in central Israel, where he could either catch a bus or hitchhike, a common practice of Israeli soldiers,The Jerusalem Post, IDF launches campaign against hitchhiking, June 5, 2012. to Jerusalem. Israeli intelligence learned that Wachsman entered a car in which there were Hamas militants wearing kippot, who had a Tanakh and siddur on the dashboard, and Chassidic music playing. =Hostage tape= On October 11, 1994, a videotape was broadcast showing Wachsman, with his hands and feet bound, before a keffiyeh-covered militant who was displaying Wachsman's identity card. After the militant recited the hostage's home address and identity number, Wachsman spoke, with the armed militant behind him, saying: > The group from Hamas kidnapped me. They are demanding the release of Sheikh > Ahmed Yassin and another 200 from Israeli prison. If their demands are not > met, they will execute me on Friday at 8 P.M.\\" Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was Hamas leader at the time and had been imprisoned by Israel since 1989. In response to the tape, Nachshon's parents pleaded with world leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, US President Bill Clinton, and Muslim religious leaders.  Search and rescue attempt  Rabin sealed Gaza, mistakenly believing that Wachsman had been taken there. The move cut off tens of thousands of Palestinian laborers from their jobs in Israel. He also called Arafat on the telephone and placed full responsibility for Wachsman's well-being on his shoulders. Arafat responded by denouncing the abduction of Wachson as an attempt to \\"embarrass\\" the Palestinian Authority (PA). A senior PA official commented that \\"the PA is committed to undertaking every possible effort to find Wachson, because his abduction is a personal affront to Yassir Arafat.\\" Over the next few days Arafat's PA security forces began cracking down and arresting dozens of Hamas officials and stopping Hamas demonstrations. Over 200 Hamas members were arrested. Eventually the Israeli secret policy, Shin Bet, captured Jihad Yarmur, the driver of the car that had picked up Wachsman. Interrogating Yarmur, they learned that Wachsman was being held in the village of Bir Nabala, a location under Israeli control located only ten minutes away from Wachsman's home in the Ramot neighborhood of Jerusalem. Rabin authorized a military rescue attempt. On Friday October 14, with 24 hours until the ultimatum, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, and Yasser Arafat announced that they had won the Nobel Peace Prize. When Peres was asked his opinion on the \\"peace\\" that he had achieved in Oslo in light of Hamas' impending deadline, he responded that the peace process involves \\"calculated risks.\\" Prayer vigils were held in many places. Over 100,000 people representing all religious, political, and social segments of the Israeli population gathered at the Western Wall. Responding to a request by Esther Wachsman, Nachshon's mother, many women lit an extra Sabbath candle for her son. At 20:00 that night, at the hour of the ultimatum, elite IDF commandos from the Sayeret Matkal special forces unit carried out an operation to free Wachsman. It was thought that Wachsman was being held behind an iron door, but in fact it was a solid steel door, and the first explosion only dented the door. The commandos immediately lost the element of surprise, giving Wachsman's captors inside time to shoot him dead and position themselves for the impending firefight. A second explosive charge was prepared and the door was finally blasted open after more than a minute, and after a heavy exchange of fire with gunmen waiting on the stairwell, the commandos reached a second iron door, and had to wait another four minutes for the charges to be set. During this time, the commandos shouted to the gunmen inside to surrender, while the gunmen replied that Waschsman was already dead and that they preferred to die. After the team broke through the door, another exchange of fire took place before the room was secured. In total, three gunmen were killed and two taken prisoner, while the leader of the commando team, Captain Nir Poraz was killed and nine commandos were wounded. Wachsman was found dead in the room. His body was slumped in a chair, wearing a kafiyeh and civilian clothes. He had been shot in the throat and chest at close range. The Wachsman family was informed of his death personally by General Yoram Yair.1995 April: Patterns of global terrorism, 1994 US Department of State Aftermath In a news conference a few hours after the failed rescue attempt, Rabin, who had authorized it, took full responsibility for it and sent his condolences to the Wachsman and Poraz families. He justified his decision by stating that Israel should do no less than what it expected the PA to do: > \\"I could not conceive that we would not do what I believe the State of > Israel in its war against terror must do; what we actually demanded of the > PA and of Arafat, in his capacity as its chairman, during the last week, > when the reports were that Wachsman was in the Gaza Strip. Therefore, this > is a policy of fighting terror to the bitter end.\\" Israeli leaders commended Arafat and the PA for their cooperation in trying to locate Wachsman and praised its work. Peres stated in a televised speech on the night of Wachsman's funeral that > \\"it's clear Hamas is against the two of us [Israel and the PA] because the > two of us are for peace... Over the last two or three days I believe that > Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian Authority did show a readiness to counteract > the danger of Hamas.\\" Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, referring to the PAs crackdown on Hamas, commented that \\"in the last few days the Palestinian Authority in Gaza has made considerable efforts.\\" Even Israeli hawks such as Gideon Ezra admitted to being impressed by Palestinian Security Chief Jibril Rajoub even as he remained wary of him. On October 20, a senior Hamas leader Imad Falouji declared that Hamas would continue fighting until Israel withdrew from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Days later, however, Hamas offered Israel a ceasefire. The abduction caused the PA to clamp down on Hamas military activity with Israeli cooperation. In early 1995, more than a hundred Islamic militants were arrested. Nachson Wachsman Sergeant Nachshon Mordechai Wachsman (, born April 3, 1975, died October 14, 1994) was an IDF soldier who was abducted and held hostage by Hamas for a period of 6 days. A dual citizen of Israel and the United States, Wachsman was raised in Jerusalem. He was the third of seven sons born to Yehuda and Esther Wachsman. His father was Israeli-born, while his mother was born in a German displaced persons camp and immigrated to Israel from Brooklyn.His Name was Nachshon Wachsman OU.org Wachsman volunteered for an elite commando unit of the Golani Brigade, serving in the Orev Golani. =Funeral= Wachsman was buried on Saturday night October 15, 1994 in the Mount Herzl military cemetery. Wachsman's Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Mordechai Elon, gave his eulogy. At the request of Wachsman's bereaved father, the rabbi told the crowd of mourners that God did listen to their prayers, and that just as a father would always like to say \\"yes\\" to all of his children's requests, sometimes he must say \\"no\\" though the child might not understand why. \\"So too our Father in Heaven heard our prayers, and though we don't understand why, His answer was 'no.'\\" =Beit Nachshon= Today \\"Beit Nachshon\\" at the SHALVA Center in Jerusalem, an association for mentally and physically challenged children, is dedicated to Wachsman's memory.

The Alte Mozart-Ausgabe is the name by which the first complete edition of the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, is known nowadays, published by Breitkopf & Härtel from January 1877 to December 1883, with supplements published until 1910. The name Alte Mozart-Ausgabe (abbreviated \\"AMA\\") is actually a modern invention to distinguish the edition from the second Mozart complete works edition, the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe; the publication title of Breitkopf & Härtel's edition was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts Werke. Kritisch durchgesehene Gesammtausgabe. (It is therefore sometimes referred to as the \\"Mozart Gesammtausgabe\\".) One of the guiding lights of the AMA was Ludwig Ritter von Köchel, compiler of the still-standard Köchel- Verzeichnis (thematic catalog) of Mozart's works. From behind the scenes, Köchel worked to have the edition completed, lending valuable scores to the publisher and editors for their work. Among those involved in the actual editing were Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, Carl Reinecke, Julius Rietz, and Philipp Spitta (the noted biographer of Johann Sebastian Bach). While a notable achievement for its time, the AMA suffered from serious limitations. Frederick Neumann remarks that it \\"varies greatly in dependability, with some volumes remarkably trustworthy, others far less so\\". Alfred Einstein expressed dissatisfaction with its presentation of Mozart's \\"Coronation\\" Concerto and Marriage of Figaro, and Friedrich Blume was particularly severe on what he called the \\"astonishing frivolity and often complete irresponsibility\\" of the editors of this edition (specifically with regard to the handling of Mozart's piano concertos), asserting that \\"the Collected Edition [i.e., the AMA] of Mozart's works and the practical editions based on it offer no more than the skeleton of his compositions.\\" There are also certain authentic works of Mozart that were never published in this edition, some because they were not discovered until well after its completion (for instance, the Symphony in F, K. 19a, rediscovered in 1981), as well as a number of works once incorrectly attributed to Mozart which are now known to be doubtful or spurious (for instance, the piece published in AMA as Mozart's Symphony No. 2 in B flat, K. 17, now considered to be by Leopold Mozart). Therefore, the AMA is no longer regarded as the definitive edition of Mozart's works, and it has been supplanted in this regard by the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe for serious study of the composer's output. However, reprints of portions of the AMA remain widely available from Dover Publications and other firms that specialize in republishing older editions. Parts of this edition are also sometimes encountered in electronic format from various websites that offer online sheet music. Archival materials of the AMA belong to the fonds 21081 Breitkopf & Härtel, Leipzig, in the Sächsisches Staatsarchiv, Staatsarchiv Leipzig, first of all engraver's models and proof prints, partly correspondence with editors.

Biography Born on December 6, 1894 in Bucharest, Henri Catargi would eventually become one of the top Romanian artists, a major influence in the national 20th century world of arts and an inspiration for many young generations of Romanian painters, as the one who tried to bring the European - and especially French - influences into traditional Romanian art. But if many before and after him did just that, Catargi managed to create an original and profoundly personal style, easily recognizable. He settled in Paris in 1919 and until 1922 he studied art at the Académie Julian and Academie Ranson, under several important teachers of his time such as Maurice Denis and Édouard Vuillard. At that time, he worked in an intense manner by himself, and discovered at the Louvre Museum the works of Poussin, his main influence at that time, which he copied and discovered time and time again. At first, his themes were fairly limited, mainly landscapes, while his style was in no small part marked by the Romantic traditions. In time his style developed to a much more modern one, even creating an impression of three dimensions in his works. It was Catargi's way of adapting to the new art, in a much more realistic fashion. During this time frame the main interest for Henri Catargi was color, with all of its nuances, although at first he mainly used brown, ochre, white, grey, green and dark red, with several variations. A rather limited palette of colors, but it made his works all the more interesting. Later, after 1930, he started incorporating more colors in his compositions and also began to emphasize important elements with thick, black lines - an interesting idea that built several \\"attention landmarks\\" in his paintings. By putting something in the front of the whole ensemble, Catargi managed to surprise and impress. He also produced an impressive number of sketches and drawings, in ink or crayon, as well as in watercolor, mainly landscapes and female figures, at the same time becoming much more popular both in his country and in Europe. He died in 1976 in Bucharest, leaving behind one of the richest selection of works ever put together by a Romanian artists.

The area lies on the eastern side of the city, on an elevated area 60 metres above Clausen and Neudorf.  History  The Kéibierg connects the Grund and Clausen with the elevation of the Fetschenhof. The name \\"Kéibierg\\" ist first recorded in a document from 20 December 1506 as Gyersberg, and is later also mentioned as Gyrsberg, Geierspergh, and Gyhersperg. In 1666/67 in the accounts of the Hospital of St. John this had become the Gansberg, and in the cadaster of 1824 it is registered as the Küheberg. The plateau of Cents-Fetschenhof was a useful area for any army wishing to attack the Fortress of Luxembourg from the East. Directly in front of the fortress walls, the elevation allowed a wide view over the whole city. In 1683 Marshal François de Créquy started the siege of Luxembourg, on the orders of French King Louis XIV. He set up his permanent camp to the East of the city at Mensdorf, where the name Krékelsbierg is still a reminder of him to this day. From there his troops — 12,000 infantry and cavalry — marched to the rise of Fetschenhof and fired on the city from the Kéibierg. They fired 6,000 projectiles at the city, causing great destruction. The historian Leo Müller described how citizens of Metz observed \\"the eerie spectacle of the burning Luxembourg, which was blazing like an almighty torch\\". Shortly after Christmas, on 27 December 1683, the French marched off. The number of civilian casualties was quite low, but the suffering of the population was severe due to the winter cold. This was made worse by the order of the Governor Chimay, to uncover the houses, in order to decrease the risk of fire. Through the destruction of buildings and the weakened state of the population, it was easy for Marshall de Créqui to take over the city in April 1684 with 35,000. In this siege, the city was devastated by over 50,000 projectiles, and was later fortified by Vauban. The French did not get to make much use of these extensive fortification works, however: in 1697 they returned Luxembourg to the Spanish. From 1713, when Luxembourg passed over to the Austrians under the Peace of Utrecht, it experienced a more peaceful time for both the fortress and its surrounding area. On 21 November 1794 however, the French again laid siege to the city, this time under the orders of the Directoire. Once again, the attackers made use of the strategic location of the Fetschenhof plateau. In a week, they had constructed the Fetschenhof entrenchment for 2 cannons — a structure which was expanded in April 1795 by six more cannons. While the city itself suffered less damage than under previous sieges, this time it was more the surrounding areas that suffered destruction. The Fetschenhof, for example, went up in flames.

The common areas of the car condo building are jointly owned by all the tenants and the car condo owner pays a monthly maintenance fee for their use. Many Car Condos are allowing usage of the units for more than just storage, allowing a mixture of business, pleasure and car storage. Some customers customize their \\"garage\\" in order to give it a personal touch. Others are running their business which cater to servicing the stored vehicles. Car condo developers are marketing their projects to the following demographic: # A classic car owner who wishes to store his/her vehicle in an optimum environment. # A person who has a secondary residence in a popular vacation destination (e.g. South Florida, Las Vegas, Scottsdale) and wishes to keep a car year-round at that destination. # A resident of an urban area (e.g. New York City) where parking a car is extremely expensive and where the car owner wishes a property interest in return for the large monthly parking outlay. Car condos range in price based on location, size, features and services. Some people take a regular storage facility and store their vehicle while others offer sizes ranging from 800 to . High-end luxury car condos are based more on a country club approach and serve their members. Some are centered on racing, R&D;, motorsports and philanthropic pursuits. The idea of mixing high-end and vintage automobiles with fund raising is reaching heights as evident in the $100,000 raised in one night for the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. As with any country club, the members require a club house which can serve as a venue for charitable, political, and corporate functions. These facilities offer their owners amenities such as round-the-clock security, automobile-related businesses and concierge services.

Encyclopaedia Britannica. britannica.com. Retrieved 30 April 2019. Meidner is best known for his painted, drawn, and printed portraits and landscapes.  Overview  Ludwig Meidner was apprenticed to a stonemason, but his apprenticeship was not completed. He studied at the Royal School of Art in Breslau and, from 1906 to 1907 he studied painting at the Académie Julian and Cormon Academies in Paris where he met and became friends with Amedeo Modigliani. He returned to Berlin to work as a fashion illustrator and produced views of Berlin. In 1912 he began a series of paintings that marked a radical departure in style and would make his reputation.\\"Apocalyptic Landscapes,\\" such as the 1914 graphite drawing at the Art Institute of Chicago, are interesting because Meidner executed them before any of the devastation of the First World War. During the same time, Ludwig co-founded the German expressionist group, \\"Die Pathetiker\\" with Jacob Steirnhardt and Richard Janthur. Their focus is on the use of pathos in art to get an emotional response, which can be seen in the apocalyptic landscapes. However his art group disbanded after their first art show in 1912. During WWI Ludwig served in the German military as a French interpreter and an infantry soldier. After the First World War Meidner turned to Orthodox Judaism and began producing more baroque-like religious paintings including a long and repetitive series of portraits of \\"prophets.\\" He was an habitual self portraitist producing a series of Rembrandt-inspired self-portraits. His portraits from 1915 to the end of the 1920s are a gallery of the leading expressionist and Dada writers and poets.Hess, Heather. \\"German Expressionism: Works from the Collection – Ludwig Meidner \\". Museum of Modern Art. moma.org. Retrieved 30 April 2019. Meidner himself increasingly turned to writing—he produced several books of dense expressionist prose and contributed to many newspaper articles.\\"Artist on the Blacklist: Ludwig Meidner \\". Holocaust Encyclopedia. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. ushmm.org. Retrieved 30 April 2019. In order to escape antisemitic repressions he moved to Cologne where he became an art teacher at Yawneh Jewish School in 1935. In 1939 he fled with his family to England (his wife Else Meidner was also an artist) where he was interned as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man. He stayed in England, unrecognised, hovering on the brink of poverty until 1953 when he returned to Germany. Although the years in exile were a period of hardship and disappointment, he created an extensive oeuvre of very original works during this time. Among those are drawings and watercolors on religious subjects, humoristic scenes and a cycle on the holocaust. In 1963 he had his first major exhibition since 1918 in Recklinghausen and Berlin. He died on 14 May 1966 in Darmstadt, aged 82. Meidner's artistic bequest is now part of the collections of the Jewish Museum Frankfurt.  Painting  Ludwig Meidner created numerous portraits throughout his life as a painter. His portraits are known to be distorted with flowing movements that create unusual perspectives in the paintings. This form of distortion and his unrefined brushstrokes is credited as helping to create an emotional sense of depression and anxiety in his portraits, which in turn detoured many from getting portraits done by Ludwig. Multiple expressionist writers such as Johannes R Becher and Max Herrmann- Neisse got painted portraits done by Meidner. Other than portraits Ludwig also created multiple landscapes of Berlin, which are frequently known as apocalyptic from the style of the pieces.Miesel, Victor H, and Ludwig Meidner.

While some people believe they predict the oncoming of WWI, others see it as presenting the movement and chaos of the urban world.Vinzent, Jutta. \\"Meidner, Ludwig Baruch (1884–1966), painter and graphic artist.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. 4 October 2008.

Meidner would, however, never repeat the intensity and creativity of the apocalyptic landscapes.  Printmaking  Ludwig's prints are made mostly through the processes of hard ground etchings, lithographs, and dry point. He continued making portraits in printmaking, such as a lithograph Theodor Dauber and an etching of Johannes Becher, that are reminiscent of his painted portrait style.Miesel, Victor H, and Ludwig Meidner.

The different prints show scenes of battle, death, bombs, guns, and overall destruction. They are made near the start of WWI to protest the war and show the horrific outcomes of war. These prints show Ludwig's far left political views on War and his connection to the Social Democratic Party of Germany.  Writing  Along with being a visual artist. Meidner is also an author of poetry and stories. While he mostly wrote poems, he also wrote a short story and three books: \\"Gang in die Stile\\" 1929,\\" Septemberschei\\" 1920, and \\"Im Nacken das Sternemeer\\" 1918; none of which became popular. Meidner created a large majority of his poetry during his time at war in WWI, since he did not have much time or supplies needed to paint, draw, or make prints. A large majority of his writing has a darker tone and eerie stories, which are told from his point of view on the world. However, Meidner's writing never grew in popularity as much as his art did with the expressionist.

She developed a paralytic illness and spent the rest of her life on a bed made from a wooden pallet, where Saint Gregory the Great allegedly appeared to her to predict her death. Miraculous healings were later attributed to her remains. Saint Fina is celebrated in San Gimignano on both March 12, the anniversary of her death, and the first Sunday in August. Her relics are kept in a chapel in the Collegiata di San Gimignano. A hospital in San Gimignano was formerly named in her honor and several paintings of her can be found in the town. Life Representation of Saint Fina on a ceramic dish Finadei Ciardi was born in San Gimignano in 1238. The Daughter of Cambio Ciardi and Imperiera, a declined noble family, she lived all her existence in a humble house located in the historic centre of the famous “city of beautiful towers” (today the small road on which her house stands takes her name). There is little record of the first ten years of her life, and what information available comes from legends narrated after her death. Some accounts note Fina's strong devotion to the Virgin Mary, and that she went out only to hear Mass. She was also said to be extraordinarily kind. In 1248, Fina’s life was changed by a serious illness, which began, progressively, to paralyse her (probably a form of tuberculous osteomyelitis). Her deep faith relieved her pain. She refused a bed and chose instead to lie on a wooden pallet. According to her legend, during her long sickness her body became attached to the wood of the table, with worms and rats feeding on her rotting flesh. During her illness, she lost her father and later her mother died after a fall. In spite of her misfortune and poverty, she thanked God and expressed a desire that her soul might separate from the body in order to meet Jesus Christ. Fina's immense devotion was an example to all the citizens of San Gimignano, who frequently visited her. Visitors were surprised to receive words of encouragement from a desperately ill young girl who was resigned to the will of God. On March 4, 1253, after five years of sickness and pain, her nurses Beldia and Bonaventura were waiting for her to die. Suddenly, Saint Gregory the Great allegedly appeared in Fina’s room and predicted that she would die on the 12th of March. Fina died on the predicted date at the age of 15. Miracles and veneration Announcement of Death to Saint Fina by Saint Gregory the Great, by Domenico Ghirlandaio. Miracles attributed to Fina are mentioned in stories, paintings, poems and in notary documents. The most important miracle of Fina's life is her vision of Saint Gregory, also because she died on Saint Gregory's feast day (12 March) as he predicted. When Fina’s body was removed from the pallet that was her deathbed, onlookers saw white violets bloom from the wood, and smelt a fresh, floral fragrance throughout her house. The violets grew on the walls of San Gimignano and still grow there today. For this reason, the townspeople call them “The Saint Fina violets.” The young girl’s body was brought to the Pieve Prepositura and during the transfer, the crowd proclaimed “The Saint is dead!” For several days, pilgrims went to the Pieve to see Fina’s remains and in the same period there were many evidences of her curative power. One was her nurse Beldia. The woman had a paralysed hand for the labour in supporting Fina’s head during her sickness. While she was near the body, the dead young girl cured Beldia’s hand. Legends say that, at the exact moment of Fina’s passing away, all the bells of San Gimignano rang without anyone touching them. Many sick people who visited her grave during the following years were cured and some of these became some of Fina's most fervent devotees. The decision of Fina to lie down on a wood table is still a mystery. Some documents tell about her sympathy for a soldier: before her sickness she received an orange from him as a love token. After the disappointment of her parents for Fina having accepted the present she might have chosen the pain. Another legend tells that during a walk with two of her friends she heard another young girl, Smeralda, crying. Smeralda had broken a pitcher that her mother had given her in order to fill with water from Fonti. While she was entertained by other children, she forgot the pitcher on the ground which unfortunately rolled down and broke. Fina told her to arrange the pieces and put them under the water: the pitcher became whole and full of water. Another anecdote about Fina’s miracles is the one of Cambio di Rustico, the Ciardi family’s neighbor. On one anniversary of Fina's death, when the townsfolk had stopped working to remember her, Cambio went to cut wood and hurt his leg. Suffering, he asked forgiveness of Saint Fina and was very sorry for not having respected her memorial. His cut then miraculously disappeared. Commemoration Saint Fina is celebrated in San Gimignano on two separated days. Her first feast is on March 12 – the anniversary of her death – which has been a statutory holiday in the town since 1481. The second feast on the first Sunday of August commemorates her stopping two plagues that ravaged the town in 1479 and 1631. On both days, her relics are carried in procession in order to bless the town. Her example of devotion has been handed down by the people of San Gimignano through her veneration, despite not being formally canonised by the Church. So, as written in some paintings dedicated to her, it would be correct to call her Blessed Fina. In fact, the official patron saint of her town is still Saint Gimignano. The hospital The most important thing “produced” in the memory of Saint Fina is the “spedale” (hospital), which took her name and was built in 1255 thanks to donations given at her tomb. The hospital gave hospitality to old and poor people and pilgrims too. It became in the following century one of the best in Tuscany. The building changed its name in 1816 and remained in function until the end of the 20th century. In the hospital’s chapel, the original oak wood table where Saint Fina lay down for five years is preserved. Iconography and biographies The most important monument dedicated to Saint Fina is her chapel (designed by Giuliano da Maiano in 1468 and consecrated in 1488) located inside the Collegiata di San Gimignano where, inside the altar (built by the brother Benedetto da Maiano), the bones are kept. On the left and right walls of the Chapel there are two frescoes painted by Domenico Ghirlandaio: one shows the vision of Saint Gregory; the other shows the funeral where the violets in blossom on the towers are represented. We also see an angel ringing the bells, Beldia’s cured hand and the self-portrait of the painter and his brother-in-law Mainardi, who painted the Chapel’s ceiling. On the altar there is a bust with Saint Fina’s relics inside. Inside the Civic Museum of San Gimignano there is a wood tabernacle (by Lorenzo di Niccolò 1402) depicting Saint Fina with the town on her lap, an icon of St Gregory and some of her anecdotes. Another image of Fina is in the nearby Sant'Agostino Church, painted by Benozzo Gozzoli. Other artists depicting the Saint’s life were Piero del Pollaiolo and Pier Francesco Fiorentino. In others small churches in the countryside other painting about Saint Fina were discovered. The most credited hagiography of Saint Fina is the one of Fra’ Giovanni del Coppo (“Historia vita et morte di Sancta Fina da San Gimignano”, written on 14th century and translated from Latin by Jacopo Manducci in 1575), who lived closest in time to Saint Fina. Many others have tried to tell Saint Fina’s life (Enrico Castaldi, Giovanni Bollando, Filippo Buonaccorsi, Teodoro Ferroni, Ignazio Malenotti, Luigi Pecori, Ugo Nomi Veronesi Pesciolini, and Enrico Fiumi). The best and most updated book is “Fina dei Ciardi”, written by Profesoressa Iole Imberciadori Vichi in 1979: a deep research of all documents and biography existing in San Gimignano archives.

The taller building stands 22 stories high on a lot bounded by Sixth Street, Howard, Abbott and the John C. Lodge Freeway. The address is 1200 Sixth Street. The first tower was constructed at the southern portion of the site in 1967 and is 11 stories. It is faced with precast concrete panels with protruding piers dividing the window bays. The corners of the building are recessed as are the windows of the top floor allowing for a small terraced area on three sides. Elevators and stairs are housed in a separate tower at the north end. It was originally conceived as the Detroit Trade Center but was purchased by the State of Michigan as an office building. The State of Michigan maintained its offices in this building until 2002 when all agencies moved to Cadillac Place. In 1974, the State added the high-rise which was constructed in a style which combined the international and black box styles. It was designed by the firm of Jickling, Lyman & Powell and is faced with reflective glass and brown aluminum panels causing it to resemble the nearby DTE Energy Headquarters. Like the first tower, the windows of the top floor are recessed, and its elevators and stairs are contained in a tower adjoining the elevator tower of the earlier structure. The state sold the property in 2003 for $12.5 million to a real estate investment group. In May 2006, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced it would acquire the site and raze the current buildings to construct new offices for the Detroit branch of the FBI. However, by July 2010 the GSA announced that the plan had been canceled because it was unable to reach an agreement with the building's current owner. Owners placed the building up for auction in 2014 with a minimum bid request of $4.5 million but received no offers.

The completion of the bridge came after a short battle between Leavenworth, Kansas, and the town of Kansas City for the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad bridge. After construction was completed, the population of Kansas City began to boom. The bridge was designed by Octave Chanute, who also designed the Kansas City Stockyards. It was a swing bridge which could open in under two minutes, and it had an arched truss design. The bridge cost $1 million to build. The bridge was built for the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad by the Keystone Bridge Company. Although the railroad became part of the BNSF Railway, the name \\"Hannibal\\" has stuck. In 1886, the bridge was severely damaged by a tornado which collapsed a middle span. It was reconstructed and its truss structure was altered from an arch design to a traditional truss design.

In humans there are two isoforms of this membrane transport protein, NKCC1 and NKCC2, encoded by two different genes (SLC12A2 and SLC12A1 respectively). Two isoforms of the NKCC1/Slc12a2 gene result from keeping (isoform 1) or skipping (isoform 2) exon 21 in the final gene product. NKCC1 is widely distributed throughout the human body; it has important functions in organs that secrete fluids. NKCC2 is found specifically in the kidney, where it serves to extract sodium, potassium, and chloride from the urine so that they can be reabsorbed into the blood. Function NKCC proteins are membrane transport proteins that transport sodium (Na), potassium (K), and chloride (Cl) ions across the cell membrane. Because they move each solute in the same direction, NKCC proteins are considered symporters. They maintain electroneutrality by moving two positively charged solutes (sodium and potassium) alongside two parts of a negatively charged solute (chloride). Thus the stoichiometry of the transported solutes is 1Na:1K:2Cl. However, there is a notable exception in squid giant axon as the symporter in this special cell has a stoichiometry of 2Na:1K:3Cl, although electroneutrality is still maintained. =NKCC1= NKCC1 is widely distributed throughout the body, especially in organs that secrete fluids, called exocrine glands. In cells of these organs, NKCC1 is commonly found in the basolateral membrane, the part of the cell membrane closest to the blood vessels. Its basolateral location gives NKCC1 the ability to transport sodium, potassium, and chloride from the blood into the cell. Other transporters assist in the movement of these solutes out of the cell through its apical surface. The end result is that solutes from the blood, particularly chloride, are secreted into the lumen of these exocrine glands, increasing the luminal concentration of solutes and causing water to be secreted by osmosis. In addition to exocrine glands, NKCC1 is necessary for establishing the potassium-rich endolymph that bathes part of the cochlea, an organ necessary for hearing. Inhibition of NKCC1, as with furosemide or other loop diuretics, can result in deafness. NKCC1 is also expressed in many regions of the brain during early development, but not in adulthood. This change in NKCC1 presence seems to be responsible for altering responses to the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine from excitatory to inhibitory, which was suggested to be important for early neuronal development. As long as NKCC1 transporters are predominantly active, internal chloride concentrations in neurons is raised in comparison with mature chloride concentrations, which is important for GABA and glycine responses, as respective ligand-gated anion channels are permeable to chloride. With higher internal chloride concentrations, outward driving force for this ions increases, and thus channel opening leads to chloride leaving the cell, thereby depolarizing it. Put another way, increasing internal chloride concentration increases the reversal potential for chloride, given by the Nernst equation. Later in development expression of NKCC1 is reduced, while expression of a KCC2 K-Cl cotransporter increased, thus bringing internal chloride concentration in neurons down to adult values. =NKCC2= NKCC2 is specifically found in cells of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the macula densa in nephrons, the basic functional units of the kidney. Within these cells, NKCC2 resides in the apical membrane abutting the nephron's lumen, which is the hollow space containing urine. It thus serves both in sodium absorption and in tubuloglomerular feedback. The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle begins at the deeper portion of the renal outer medulla. Here, the urine has a relatively high concentration of sodium. As urine moves towards the more superficial portion of the thick ascending limb, NKCC2 is the major transport protein by which sodium is reabsorbed from the urine. This outward movement of sodium and the lack of water permeability in the thick ascending limb, creates a more diluted urine. According to the stoichiometry outlined above, each molecule of sodium reabsorbed brings one molecule of potassium and two molecules of chloride. Sodium goes on to be reabsorbed into the blood, where it contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure. Furosemide and other loop diuretics inhibit the activity of NKCC2, thereby impairing sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The action of these loop diuretics also reduces potassium reabsorption through the NKCC2 cotransporter and consequently increases tubular flow rate which enhances potassium secretion and emphasises the hypokalaemic effect. Impaired sodium reabsorption increases diuresis by three mechanisms: # Increases the amount of active osmolytes in urine by decreasing absorption of sodium # Erases the papillar gradient # Inhibits tubuloglomerular feedback Loop diuretics therefore ultimately result in decreased blood pressure. The hormone vasopressin, stimulates the activity of NKCC2. Vasopressin stimulates sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the nephron by activating signaling pathways. Vasopressin increases the traffic of NKCC2 to the membrane and phosphorylates some serine and threonine sites on the cytoplasmic N-terminal of the NKCC2 located in the membrane, increasing its activity. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water reabsorption in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate. Genetics NKCC1 and NKCC2 are encoded by genes on the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 5, respectively. A loss of function mutation of NKCC2 produces Bartter syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with normal to low blood pressure. Kinetics The energy required to move solutes across the cell membrane is provided by the electrochemical gradient of sodium. Sodium's electrochemical gradient is established by the Na-K ATPase, which is an ATP-dependent enzyme. Since NKCC proteins use sodium's gradient, their activity is indirectly dependent on ATP; for this reason, NKCC proteins are said to move solutes by way of secondary active transport. There are three isoforms of NKCC2 created by alternative splicing (NKCC2A, B and F). Each one of these isoforms is expressed at different portions of the thick ascending limb and they have different affinity for sodium that correlates with its localization. The isoform F is more predominant in the deeper portion of the thick ascending limb, where the sodium concentration is very high. NKCC2F is the isoform with the lowest affinity for sodium and this allows the cotransporter to work at this sodium rich environment. Conversely, NKCC2B is expressed at the more superficial portion of the thick ascending limb and the macula densa, and it has the highest affinity for sodium. This permits NKCC2B to function in this sodium- depleted environment without saturating. The NKCC2A isoform shows an intermediate distribution and affinity for sodium. In this way, NKCC2 is able to function properly along the range of sodium concentrations found along the thick ascending limb.

It was defined by the German standards body DIN - Deutsches Institut für Normung (German Institute for Standardization), pronounced as \\"Din\\", in the standard sheet DIN 1451-Schriften (typefaces) in 1931. Similar standards existed for stencilled letters. Originally designed for industrial uses, the first DIN-type fonts were a simplified design that could be applied with limited technical difficulty. Due to the design's legibility and uncomplicated, unadorned design, it has become popular for general purpose use in signage and display adaptations. Many adaptations and expansions of the original design have been released digitally. Overview Early DIN-Fette Engschrift specimen. Fette Engschrift is a single weight of the DIN 1451 typeface. The DIN 1451 typeface family includes both a medium (Mittelschrift) and a condensed (Engschrift) version; an older extended version (Breitschrift) has not been used since the early 1980s, but may still be encountered on older road signs in Germany. DIN 1451 is the typeface used on road signage in Germany and a number of other countries. It was also used on German car number plates from 1956, until replaced there in January 1995 by FE-Schrift, a typeface especially designed to make the plates more tamper-proof and to optimize automatic character recognition. The typeface has gained popularity due to its wide exposure through its release as a PostScript typeface in 1990. Since then, it is also used by non-governmental organisations and businesses. For graphic design and desktop publishing, several type foundries offer redesigned and extended versions of this typeface. History German road signs using both the DIN 1451 Mittelschrift (left) and Engschrift (right) typefaces In 1931, the DIN institute published DIN 1451. It contained several standard typefaces for mechanically engraved lettering, hand-lettering, lettering stencils and printing types. These were to be used in the areas of signage, traffic signs, wayfinding, lettering on technical drawings and technical documentation. The origins of DIN 1451 Engschrift (\\"condensed face\\") for hand lettering date back to 1905, when the Prussian state railways prescribed a standardized lettering style for use on all of its rolling stock. This specification was published in a document known as Musterzeichnung (\\"Master Template\\"; lit. \\"pattern drawing\\") IV 44. Ten years later, the company – by then, renamed Prussian- Hessian Railways – additionally required that signage lettering on railway platforms and station premises also be rendered according to the 1905 master template. Then, as a byproduct of the 1920 consolidation of all German railway companies into the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the Prussian railway's typeface quickly became a de facto national standard, even before the DIN Committee of Typefaces took up its work on DIN 1451 a few years later. The DIN Committee of Typefaces was headed by the Siemens engineer, Ludwig Goller (1884–1964), who also led the central standardization office at Siemens & Halske in Berlin, between 1920 and 1945. The design included not only the DIN Engschrift, but also a DIN Mittelschrift (\\"medium[-width] face\\" – now very popular). A DIN Breitschrift (\\"extended face\\") design was also included, but it has never been widely used. In order to enable quick and easy reproduction, all drawings were originally based on a coarse grid and could be executed with compass and rulers. The Normblatt (\\"standards sheet\\") DIN 1451, Schriften (\\"Typefaces\\") was released preliminarily in 1931; then, with some minor changes in 1936, it was released as an official standard. In 1938, Temporary Order No. 20 required DIN 1451 to be used on the new German Autobahn (motorway) system. Due to this and similar regulations, DIN 1451 still dominates German public lettering today. Stencilled and DIN-style lettering on a street sign in Steinlah, a district of Haverlah In 1923, Stempel was the first type foundry to produce printing type according to a DIN Standard. The design follows DIN 16, an earlier standard for oblique lettering on technical drawings, which had been released in 1919. In 1929, the Berthold Type Foundry released a similar typeface. DIN 16 had also been made available as lettering templates engraved in celluloid material for drafting use by the Filler and Fiebig company in Berlin. Stencils for lettering technical drawings to DIN standards Within the scope of public and technical lettering, the use of the DIN 1451 typefaces spread rapidly once they were adopted. They were released as celluloid lettering stencils for smaller applications, as larger metal stencils for application to machinery, vehicles and airplanes, and as cast metal lettering for street and building signage; nevertheless, printing type conforming to DIN 1451 have never been produced. During World War II, DIN 1451 was also adopted in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The 1943 version of DIN 1451 added a set of Cyrillic characters, although their design did not match the weight and proportions of DIN Mittelschrift. Sans-serif lettering and typefaces styled around geometric shapes, along with Art Deco in general, was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s. At the Bauhaus, the use of coarse grids for designing typefaces was advocated by Herbert Bayer and Joost Schmidt during the Dessau period. Although of a similar design, the DIN typefaces did not incorporate the elegance of this stylistic trend. Inspired by the DIN standard, a consortium of Dutch organisations created an equivalent lettering standard, NEN 3225. Created by a group of designers that included Jan van Krimpen, the design has no similarity to the DIN standard: it is a humanist family with serif and sans-serif styles. The sans-serif is similar to Gill Sans and to Johnston; the serif reflects the classical Renaissance humanist model.  Releases  A sign in an older version of DIN Mittelschrift. Note the different structure of the 'a' and how curved strokes do not thin as they connect, as at the join of the 'h'. The transferable-lettering-sheet company, Letraset made several variants available in the 1970s. Also, the Berthold type foundry adopted the DIN typefaces for their optomechanical phototype setting systems such as Staromat. In 1980, the DIN typefaces were redrawn by Adolf Gropp (1911–1996), a lettering artist from Frankfurt. The drawings were made on a finer grid. This enabled an exact definition of details such as the amount of overshoot of round characters (e.g. C, G and O) below the baseline and above the cap height. Also, characters such as S for which an accurate construction drawing had never been made were now defined using lines and arcs for the new cutting plotters that were to be used for the lettering on motorway signage. A number of the glyphs were changed, in particular those for \\"a\\", \\"6\\" and \\"9\\" as well as \\"t\\" in DIN Engschrift. By the mid 1980s, Linotype adopted the redrawn DIN typefaces for digital photocomposition. Together with Adobe, they released it as DIN Mittelschrift and DIN Engschrift in 1990. Thus, the typefaces became part of the Adobe/Linotype PostScript typeface library. The use of DIN typefaces started to appear in the work of cutting edge graphic designers and design studios such as Uwe Loesch in Germany, Tel Design in the Netherlands, as well as David Carson and April Greiman in the USA. Soon, other leading designers began using DIN Mittelschrift and Engschrift, making it a popular option to other sans serif faces. Third-party adaptations Albert- Jan Pool, author of one of the most famous adaptations of DIN, FF DIN, speaking about the design's history With the popularity of the DIN fonts, with their minimal, modern design, several designers and companies have released their own interpretations and adaptations, often adding new weights such as light or extra-bold, and italics, causing a range of digital interpretations to exist. One of the most famous and best-selling digitisations of DIN is FF DIN (1995), created by Dutch typeface designer Albert-Jan Pool for FontFont. Typographica editor Stephen Coles has particularly praised it for the quality of its hinting for onscreen display. Users include the New York City Ballet, ETH Zurich, The Verge and the film The Wolf of Wall Street. Unlike the original design, it uses conventional weight names. As the original DIN design is out of copyright, other companies have offered digital releases (or obtained rights to resell Linotype's). Parachute (Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek), Elsner+Flake, Paratype (with Cyrillic characters) and others have issued revivals of some DIN styles, often upgraded with additional weights. Fontsite renamed its release 'Fette 1451'. Samples of various versions of lettering of DIN and related styles in digital format, mostly by Peter Wiegel An extensive set of digitisations is that made by Peter Wiegel with donations requested from users under the OFL. This includes the regular style (Mittelschrift) in two grades for printing with less and more ink spread, and the less well-known Breitschrift. He also digitised the rounded DIN 16 Oblique and DIN 17 Upright Standard Typeface for Drawings using the names TGL 0-16 and 0-17, the names under which they were known in the German Democratic Republic. Microsoft created custom digitizations of both Mittelschrift and Engschrift versions of DIN 1451 in 2013, but this version was never released publicly. In 2016, Microsoft decided to create a version of this font named \\"Bahnschrift\\" as its first ever Open Type variable font. The Bahnschrift source was completely rebuilt from the ground up by Aaron Bell of Saja Typeworks and was expanded in weight, character set and manual hinting. The font was bundled in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update in 2017. It supports Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Currency Symbols and some Coptic. Its first major use is in Xbox Game Bar app. Usage examples The pre-1994 German number plate format (DIN-style), no longer issued, but still in use Font for many license plates throughout Europe, but also Africa and Asia, including: * Azerbaijan * Belarus * Cambodia *Estonia * Faroe Islands * Hungary * Indonesia * Israel * Latvia (with Mittelschrift used also in road signage) * Lebanon * Lithuania * Moldova (until 2015; *) + Transnistria * Mongolia * Niger * Palestine * Portugal + Cape Verde * Romania * San Marino * Togo * Tunisia * Turkmenistan * Vietnam * Some variants in Cyprus, including Sovereign Base Areas (GB) * Vehicle travelling outside Iran * Some variants of French plates (current and pre-2009 format, as well as diplomatic, military personnel stationed in Germany, temporary) * Some variants in Turkey * Some variants of international organisations - United Nations, European Union and Council of Europe missions - and militaries (for example: Netherlands & France forces in Germany) and older plates of: * Albania  Belgium * Bosnia and Herzegovina  Botswana * Chile  Cuba  Georgia  Germany  Ghana  Guinea * Guinea Bissau * Kyrgyzstan  South Sudan  Uganda * Other countries use slightly modified versions of the font: * Austria (rounded) * Czech Republic (narrower) * Slovakia (notable differences for '0' and '7') * Spain (narrower) * Old Italy (notable differences for '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '9', 'G', 'M', 'Q', 'W') * Old Poland (notable differences for '4', '6', '7', '9', 'K', 'M', 'W') In several countries, marked with *, it has been superseded by FE-Schrift, a typeface developed specifically to hinder tampering.

The microregion is bordered by the state of Rio de Janeiro to the east. It is a famous touristic destination, mainly because of the 160 beaches. According to IBGE, Caraguatatuba Microregion has a GDP of R$2,019,94,.048,00 and a population of 281,532 people spread over an area of 1,947.702 km², which means that the density is 144.5/km². The population increases considerably during the summer, because of the tourists.  Municipalities  The microregion consists of the following municipalities:Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, territorial division. *Caraguatatuba *Ilhabela *São Sebastião *Ubatuba  History  The first city to be settled was São Sebastião, in 1636. Ubatuba came next, in 1637, and then Ilhabela in 1805. Caraguatatuba was the last one, in 1857. However, it is important to note that the channel between Ilhabela and São Sebastião had already been sailed by the Portuguese in 1502. All four cities relied on agriculture and fishing as its main economic activities for most of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, whereas São Sebastião served as a major sugar cane, coffea and tobacco production site. In the second half of the 20th century, the cities started to receive several tourists, mostly from São Paulo and nearby cities. This made it possible for the region to make money out of tourism, via hotels, restaurants, handicraft stores and nightclubs.  Geography  The Serra do Mar mountain range dominates the landscape of the microregion. Urbanization took place in the plains between the mountains and the sea. The highest point is the Pico de São Sebastião (Saint Sebastian's Peak), in Ilhabela, at above sea level. The oceanic climate sets the temperatures around the region between 20 and 30 °C for most of the year. Rain falls moderately, but it falls more frequently particularly in Ubatuba, which is the reason of the city's nickname Ubachuva (lit. Ubarain).  Transportation  = Highways = The only road crossing all the microregion (except for the island municipality of Ilhabela) is the BR-101, which runs near the sea and serves as the main connection between the cities. São Sebastião is the only city not to have a connection to the countryside. Caraguatatuba is connected to São José dos Campos via the Tamoios Highway. From Ubatuba, it is possible to reach Taubaté via the Oswaldo Cruz Highway. To reach Ilhabela, the island is only accessible via the ferry boats departing from São Sebastião. The crossing takes 15 minutes, although sometimes people must wait more than an hour to take the boat. = Air = Ubatuba Airport is the only one in the microregion. It operates from sunrise to sunset only, and it is used mainly for non-commercial flights. It has a single 930 m asphalt 09/27 runway.

It is now a ward of Ipswich Borough Council in Suffolk, England. The site of a Roman villa, the village is thought to have been a Saxon colony, possibly dating from the Saxon invasion of around 430 AD. It appears in the Domesday Book as Widituna, possibly meaning Hwita's farm or White's farm. Church of St Mary and St Botolph, Whitton  Whitton Church  Whitton is a village with Saxon origins and it is likely that a small place of worship has been here from the earliest times. At some point in the sixth or seventh century Christianity arrived in the area and this building would have been converted to Christian use. The Domesday Book (1086) lists a church at Whitton (Widetuna) as well as one at Thurleston (Turestuna). Nothing of either the Saxon or the Norman building remains, however, the original ground plan of the present church seems to follow a traditional simple Saxon church pattern. This church was built during the thirteenth century in the Early English style which was faithfully repeated in the present Victorian reconstruction and enlargement during the 19th Century. The parish church is dedicated to St. Mary and St. Botolph. The latter is a reminder of all that remains of the now demolished church at the tiny hamlet of Thurleston. St. Botolph was still in use in 1500, but after being amalgamated with Whitton it fell into disrepair. It remained in use as a barn until 1862, when it was demolished and much of the building material used to construct a south aisle and tower for St. Mary's at Whitton. The dedication (Name) of Whitton Church has been the subject of confusion over the years. At various points in its history it has changed back and forth between St Mary and St Botolph. The confusion arose because Thurleston Church, dedicated to Saint Botolph, was often mentioned in the same sentence as Whitton Church, which was dedicated to Saint Mary. This confusion became more pronounced when the stones of the old Thurleston Church were brought to Whitton in 1862 and used in the construction of the new south aisle and tower. In 1990 it was decided to bring the confusion to an end, and an official application was made to change the name to St. Mary and St. Botolph. The old village of Whitton was centred on what was the main Ipswich to Norwich road. Some old buildings remain including the Whitton Maypole, a popular local pub. A map of 1889 shows a \\"corn\\" windmill at the top of what is now Shakespeare Rd. There was a post office which was in use until the 1980s and a police station built in 1905. This is now a private house next to the entrance of the former site of Thomas Wolsey School now a small housing estate with its entrance in Malkin Close. The village boasted a second pub almost opposite the police station, The Crown. This was demolished in 1994, replaced by a Landrover sales garage which in 2012 was bought by BMW.  Whitton Schools and The 'Poets' Estate  An 1891 map shows a \\"school\\" in the grounds of St.Mary and St.Botolph Church and another \\"school\\" is marked adjacent to the police station - Whitton 'Open Air School' for those suffering from TB which was to grow into Thomas Wolsey School. A smithy is also marked just to the north of the police station on the Norwich Road. The footpath from the Norwich Road to the cornmill remains today as a public right of way south of Ballater Close and north of the recreation ground; the area doubling as playing fields for the Primary School. Whitton Farm was a working farm on the corner of Norwich Road and Whitton Church Lane until the early 1980s. An Ordnance Survey bench mark of 132.8 ft is marked on the road opposite the Whitton Farm buildings. A building labelled White House is shown where Arnold Close and Coleridge Road now stand. This is not to be confused with another building just to the west of Norwich Road which bears the same name and after which the modern White House council estate was named. Whitton estate was built around the village of Whitton in the mid 20th century, thereby joining it to the nearby town of Ipswich. Most of the street names are called after poets and playwrights.  Castle Hill and the Crofts  Part of the Ecclesiastical parish of Whitton with Thurleston and Akenham is the newer housing area of Castle Hill called 'The Crofts' The remains of a Roman villa were excavated in 1931 and again in 1949 before residential building started. Coins were found along with a mosaic floor which is on display in Ipswich Museum. It featured on Channel 4's archaeological television programme Time Team in 2004. The dig helped provide more evidence to supplement that gathered in the 1949 dig by archaeologist Basil Brown. The parish of Whitton is bordered by Ipswich to the south, the parish of Westerfield to the east, the parishes of Akenham (now part of the enlarged parish of Whitton with Thurleston and Akenham) and Claydon to the north and Bramford to the west. Sport and leisure Whitton has a Non-League football club Whitton United F.C. which plays at The King George V Playing Fields. Whitton Sports Centre, run by Ipswich Borough Council, situated at the junction of Whitton Church Lane and Shakespeare Road has a Gym a sports hall, an all-weather bowls rink, a Cycle Racing track and several all-weather pitches.

The branding takes after the name of the founder, Andreas Kaisis, a local entrepreneur. KMC manufactured (in most cases assembled) trucks, buses, and many speciality vehicles such as ambulances, fire engines and airport vehicles (e.g. mobile stair vehicles). The first models were based on British Dennis models. History In 1974 the company started producing trucks based on Commer, Dodge and M.A.N. designs. The company produced several other vehicle types, including a number of van and bus designs (such as the Commer/Dodge PB SpaceVan series, the Dodge Walk-thru van range and the Dodge Commando series) and a 6x6 military truck. It also ventured into the 4x4 market with several unsuccessful models (some based on Romanian ARO models). Beyond the small Cypriot market, KMC sold its vehicles to over 20 countries, mostly in the Middle East. Of note was the company’s purchase (in 1974) of the blueprints to the Clan sports car, designed by a team of former Lotus engineers, with plans to set up an assembly line in KMC’s new factory near Nicosia International Airport. This activity was cut short after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 when the new factory was caught in the buffer zone and thus had to be evacuated. The factory sits vacant to this day.

Software in the public domain can be modified, distributed, or sold even without any attribution by anyone; this is unlike the common case of software under exclusive copyright, where software licenses grant limited usage rights. Under the Berne Convention, which most countries have signed, an author automatically obtains the exclusive copyright to anything they have written, and local law may similarly grant copyright, patent, or trademark rights by default. The Berne Convention also covers programs. Therefore, a program is automatically subject to a copyright, and if it is to be placed in the public domain, the author must explicitly disclaim the copyright and other rights on it in some way, e.g. by a waiver statement.Open Source: Technology and Policy by Fadi P. Deek, James A. M. McHugh \\"Public domain\\", page 227 (2008). In some jurisdictions, some rights (in particular moral rights) cannot be disclaimed: for instance, civil law tradition-based German law's \\"Urheberrecht\\" differs here from the Anglo-Saxon common law tradition's \\"copyright\\" concept.  History  = Early academic public-domain software ecosystem = In the 1950s to the 1990s software culture, as original academic phenomena, \\"public-domain\\" (usually abbreviated to \\"PD\\") software was popular. This kind of freely distributed and shared \\"free software\\" combined the nowadays differentiated software classes of freeware, shareware and free and open-source software and was created in academia, and by hobbyists and hackers. As software was often written in an interpreted language such as BASIC, the source code was needed and therefore distributed to run the software. PD software was also shared and distributed as printed source code (type-in program) in computer magazines (like Creative Computing, SoftSide, Compute!, Byte etc.) and books, like the bestseller BASIC Computer Games. Early on, closed-source software was uncommon until the mid-1970s to the 1980s.Object code only: is IBM playing fair? IBM's OCO policy protects its own assets but may threaten customers investment on Computerworld - 8 Febr. 1988Firm sidestep IBM policy by banning software changes on Computerworld (18 March 1985) Before 1974, when the US Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) decided that \\"computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author's original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright\\",Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corporation Puts the Byte Back into Copyright Protection for Computer Programs in Golden Gate University Law Review Volume 14, Issue 2, Article 3 by Jan L. Nussbaum (January 1984)Lemley, Menell, Merges and Samuelson. Software and Internet Law, p. 34. software was not copyrightable and therefore always in public domain. This legislation, plus court decisions such as Apple v. Franklin in 1983 for object code, clarified that the Copyright Act gave computer programs the copyright status of literary works. In the 1980s, a common way to share public-domain software was by receiving them through a local user group or a company like PC-SIG, of Sunnyvale, California, who maintained a mail-order catalog of more than 300 disks with an average price of US$6. Public-domain software with source code was also shared on BBS networks. Public-domain software was commercialized sometimes by a donationware model, asking the users for a money donation to be sent by mail.April 1987: Ballerburg - Zwei Spieler, zwei Burgen und ein Berg dazwischen... on eckhardkruse.net: \\"Ich habe das Programm als Public Domain veröffentlicht (die Unterscheidung in Freeware, Shareware usw. gab es damals nicht), mit der Bitte um eine 20 DM Spende. Dafür gab es dann die erweitere Version und den Quellcode.\\" (in German). The public-domain \\"free sharing\\" and \\"donationware\\" commercialization models evolved in following years to the (non-voluntary) shareware model,Article about Jim \\"Button\\" Knopf, from Dr. Dobb's Journal. and software free of charge, called freeware.the-history-of- shareware-psl on asp-software.org. Additionally, due to other changes in the computer industry, the sharing of source code became less usual. With the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier Copyright Act of 1976), the legal base for public-domain software changed drastically. Before the act, releasing a software without copyright notice was enough for dedicating to public domain. With the new copyright act, software was by default copyright-protected and needed an explicit waiver statement or license of the author. Reference implementations of algorithms, often cryptographic algorithms, meant or applied for standardization are still often given into the public domain, examples are CERN httpdThe birth of the web Licensing the web on cern.ch (2014). in 1993 and Serpent cipher in 1999. The Openwall Project maintains a list of several algorithms and their source code in the public domain.Source code snippets and frameworks placed in the public domain on openwall.info. = Free and open-source software as successor= As response in the end 1980s of the academic software ecosystem to the change in the copyright system, permissive license texts were developed, like the BSD license and derivatives. Permissive-licensed software, which is a kind of free and open-source software, shares most characteristics of the earlier public- domain software, but stands on the legal base of copyright law. In 1980s Richard Stallman, who worked long in an academic environment of \\"public- domain\\"-like software sharing, noticed the emerge of proprietary software and the decline of the public-domain software ecosystem. As approach to preserve this ecosystem he created a software license, the GPL, which encodes the \\"public-domain\\" rights and enforces them irrevocably on software. Paradoxically, his copyleft approach relies on the enforceability of the copyright to be effective. Copyleft free software shares therefore many properties with public-domain software, but doesn't allow relicensing or sublicensing. Unlike real public-domain software or permissive-licensed software, Stallman's copyleft license tries to enforce the free shareability of software also for the future by not allowing license changes. To refer to free software (which is under a free software license) or to software distributed and usable free of charge (freeware) as \\"public-domain\\" is therefore incorrect. While public domain gives up the author's exclusive rights (e.g. copyright), in free software the author's copyright is still retained and used, for instance to enforce copyleft or to hand out permissive- licensed software. Licensed software is in general not in the public domain. Another distinct difference is that an executable program may be in the public domain even if its source code is not made available (making the program not feasibly modifiable), while free software has the source code always available. = Post-copyright public domain = With the 2000s and the emerge of peer-to-peer sharing networks and sharing in web development, a new copyright-critical developer generation made the \\"license-free\\" public-domain software model visible again, also criticizing the FOSS license ecosystem (\\"Post Open Source\\") as stabilizing part of the copyright system.The Surprising History of Copyright and The Promise of a Post-Copyright World by Karl Fogel (2006).Younger developers reject licensing, risk chance for reform on opensource.com by Luis Villa (on 12 Feb 2013).Pushing back against licensing and the permission culture Luis Villa (January 28, 2013).Post open source software, licensing and GitHub on opensource.com by Richard Fontana (on 13 Aug 2013). New non-FOSS licenses and waiver texts were developed, notable the Creative Commons \\"CC0\\" (2009) and the \\"Unlicense\\" (2010), and a growing popularity of permissive software licenses was noticed. Also, the growing problem of orphaned software and digital obsolescence of software raised the awareness of the relevance of passing software into public domain again for a better digital preservation of the digital heritage, unrestricted by copyright and DRM. Around 2004 there was a debate whether public-domain software can be considered part of the FOSS ecosystem, as lawyer Lawrence Rosen argued in the essay \\"Why the public domain isn't a license\\" that software could not truly be given into public domain, a position that faced opposition by Daniel J. Bernstein and others.Placing documents into the public domain by Daniel J. Bernstein on cr.yp.to: \\"Most rights can be voluntarily abandoned ('waived') by the owner of the rights. Legislators can go to extra effort to create rights that can't be abandoned, but usually they don't do this. In particular, you can voluntarily abandon your United States copyrights: 'It is well settled that rights gained under the Copyright Act may be abandoned. But abandonment of a right must be manifested by some overt act indicating an intention to abandon that right. See Hampton v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 279 F.2d 100, 104 (9th Cir. 1960).' \\" (2004). In 2012, the status was finally resolved when Rosen changed his mind and accepted the CC0 as open-source license, while admitting that contrary to previous claims copyright can be waived away, backed by a Ninth circuit's decision.  Passing of software into public domain  = Release without copyright notice = Before the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier Copyright Act of 1976, which went into effect in 1978) works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit copyright notice and no copyright registration. After the 1988 implementation act, all works were by default copyright-protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a waiver statement.publicdomain on cornell.eduCopyright Notice, U.S. Copyright Office Circular 3, 2008. = Leaving the copyright term = Copyrighted works, like software, are meant to pass into public domain after the copyright term, losing their copyright privilege. Due to the decades-long copyright protection granted by the Berne Convention, no software has ever passed into public domain by leaving copyright terms. The question how fast works should pass into public domain has been a matter of scientific and public debates, also for software like video games. = Public-domain-like licenses and waivers = WTFPL license logo, a public-domain-like license CC0 license logo, a copyright waiver and public-domain-like license While real public domain makes software licenses unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission (\\"Permission culture\\"), there are licenses that grant public-domain-like rights. There is no universally agreed-upon license, but multiple licenses that aim to release source code into the public domain. In 2000 the WTFPL was released as public-domain-like license/waiver/anti-copyright notice.Version 1.0 license on anonscm.debian.org. In 2009 the Creative commons released the CC0, which was created for compatibility with also law domains (e.g. Civil law of continental Europe) where dedicating into public domain is problematic. This is achieved by a public-domain waiver statement and a fall-back all- permissive license, for the case the waiver is not possible.https://creativecommons.org/weblog/2009/03/11/13304Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in Berlin, Germany. The Unlicense, published around 2010, has a focus on an anti-copyright message. The Unlicense offers a public-domain waiver text with a fall-back public-domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution clause.The unlicense a license for no license on ostatic.com by Joe Brockmeier (2010)The Unlicense on unlicense.org. In 2015 GitHub reported that of their approx. 5.1 million licensed projects hosted almost 2% use the unlicense, approx. 102,000 projects. Another option is the Zero Clause BSD license, released in 2006 and aimed to software. In result, such licensed public-domain software has all four freedoms but is not hampered by the complexities of attribution (restriction of permissive licensed software) or license compatibility (issue with copyleft licensed software).  Public-domain software  See also , = Classical PD software (pre 1988) = Public domain software in the early computer age was for instance shared as type-in program in computer magazines and books like BASIC Computer Games. Explicit PD waiver statements or license files were at that time unusual. Publicly available software without a copyright notice was assumed to be, and shared as, public-domain software. Notable general PD software from that time include: * ELIZA (1966)The Genealogy of Eliza by Jeff Shrager * SPICE (1973)history-of-spice on allaboutcircuits.com \\"The origin of SPICE traces back to another circuit simulation program called CANCER. Developed by professor Ronald Rohrer of U.C. Berkeley along with some of his students in the late 1960s, CANCER continued to be improved through the early 1970s. When Rohrer left Berkeley, CANCER was re-written and re-named to SPICE, released as version 1 to the public domain in May of 1972. Version 2 of SPICE was released in 1975 (version 2g6—the version used in this book—is a minor revision of this 1975 release). Instrumental in the decision to release SPICE as a public-domain computer program was professor Donald Pederson of Berkeley, who believed that all significant technical progress happens when information is freely shared. I for one thank him for his vision.\\" * BLAS (1979) * FFTPACK (1985) Video games are among the earliest examples of shared PD software, which are still notable today: * Spacewar!

On the other hand, magazines started in the mid-1980s to claim copyright even for type-in programs that were seen as PD before.Compute- Gazette-Issue-11-01.pdfTransactor_v8i3.pdf: \\"though our disk labels show a copyright notice, up until this issue we stated right on our policies page (page 2) that our programs are 'public domain; free to copy, not to sell'. This notice goes back about 4 years – a popular phrase originally designed to prevent one's program from being 'acquired' by someone in the software business\\". Only slowly PD software authors started to include explicit relinquishment or license statement texts. = Examples of modern PD software (post 1988) = These examples of modern PD software (after the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988) is either under proper public domain (e.g. created by a US governmental organization), under a proper public- domain-like license (for instance CC0) or accompanied by a clear waiver statement from the author. While not as widespread as in the pre-2000s, PD software still exists nowadays. For example, SourceForge listed 334 hosted PD projects in 2016,334 PD projects on sourceforge.net (February 2016) GitHub 102,000 PD projects under the unlicense alone in 2015. In 2016 an analysis of the Fedora Project's packages revealed \\"public domain\\" as seventh most popular \\"license\\". The award-winning video game developer Jason Rohrer releases his works into the PD, as do several cryptographers, such as Daniel J. Bernstein, Bruce Schneier and Douglas Crockforddouglascrockford on GitHub, with reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms. * BLAST (1990) * CERN's httpd (1993)PUBLIC DOMAIN CERN WWW SOFTWARE (1993) * ImageJ (1997)disclaimer on rsb.info.nih.gov * Serpent (cipher) (1999)SERPENT - A Candidate Block Cipher for the Advanced Encryption Standard \\"Serpent is now completely in the public domain, and we impose no restrictions on its use.

Kristin is an IB World School with approximately students. The school was established in 1973 by a small group of parents, and is owned by the Kristin School Charitable Trust (non-profit making - fees are used to pay expenses and facilities) and is governed by trustees and governors appointed from both the school and the wider community. Kristin contains a Kindergarten and is divided into three separate schools - Junior (years 0-6), Middle (years 7-10), and Senior (years 11-13). Reflecting contemporary managerialism, each school has its own principal and an executive principal has overall responsibility to the Board of Governors. History Kristin School's Library information centre built in 2004 At the end of 1972 St Anne's, a private school in Takapuna on Auckland's North Shore, was forced to close. Concerned parents held meetings and decided to start a new school, which opened in February 1973, using the leased Methodist Health Camp at Campbells Bay. The initial roll was 42 children with a staff of five. Fees were $100 per term. Immediately a search was carried out to find a permanent home for the future. The school grew rapidly, and soon a suitable site was found at Albany, where Kristin opened in 1978 with a roll of 235. The roll in 2007 had grown to a total of approximately 1670 with students from at least 42 cultures. CurriculumInternational Baccalaureate: Primary Years Programme - For Years 1 to 6 Middle Years Programme - For Years 7 to 10 Diploma programme - For Year 12 and 13 students Year 11 students generally complete NCEA Level 1, even if they choose to study for the IB Diploma starting in Year 12. *New Zealand NCEA Level 2 - Generally taken in Year 12 Level 3 - Generally taken in Year 13 House System Kristin School has a house system consisting of four houses: Mariner, Jupiter, Apollo, Saturn. The houses are named after the corresponding space probes launched by NASA. The naming of the houses after the space probes reflects the school's and the greater Albany region's historical origins. Founded in 1973, space exploration was at the forefront of human progression and the school's houses were named to reflect the same pioneering spirit the founding parents of the school held. Many of the streets in the area reflect the importance of this era also most notably William Pickering Drive. William Pickering was a New Zealand rocket scientist that worked for NASA involved with these space probes. Other such as Constellation and Apollo Drive can be noted. Houses compete against each other in sporting codes such as Cross Country and Athletics as well as Cultural events such as House Music. House Music had its inception in 2011 and is an event where each house competes with musical theatre numbers the students have devised. House Points can also be won for academic merit and good behaviour at the discretion of the teaching staff. In the Senior School, the houses provide the framework for the pastoral care system. From Years 11-13 each house has a dean in charge of the students for each of the Houses. In Year 11 and Year 12, annual school camps are grouped by houses, and each house has its own student council to initiate community service projects within the wider school community. Forensics@Kristin Since 2011, Kristin School has run a forensic science school holiday non-residential camp for gifted Year 8 and 9 students based at its campus. The participants join teams and become student 'detectives', working to solve crime scenarios using forensic techniques.http://www.kristin.net.nz/ Throughout the programme, students have the opportunity to hear talks from SOCO officers, other forensics professionals, and Crown prosecutors. On the final day, a trial is held for each case, where alumni judges and lawyers preside over mock cases. Student 'controller' and 'logistics' steering teams are responsible for organising the majority of the behind the scenes aspect of the camp, such as writing the crime scenarios or organising the logistics and catering behind the camp's operation, respectively. Many 'detectives' progress to becoming members of these steering teams in subsequent years. Since the camp's inception in 2011, it has grown from a 3-day event to a 5-day programme, so far held in October 2012 and July 2013, 2014 and 2015. Currently, each camp attracts upwards of 100 student participants from schools around the Auckland region. The camp has also expanded to include a 5-day \\"Senior Scholars\\" Camp for students in years 11-13, and a \\"Junior Edition\\" day camp for primary school students. Teachers- in-charge of the project pride its student-run and student-led approach to organisation, planning and operation. Kristin Fashion Show Originally named the \\"Canteen Fashion Show\\", the event was started by Claire Ashenden and Tom McRae in 1998 after a close friend and classmate died as a result of cancer. The students thought that a positive way to help other teens in this situation would be to raise money. They decided to this by hosting a fashion show, and passing all proceeds onto CanTeen, a New Zealand organisation who works to provide support for teenagers with cancer. Eight years on, the name has been changed to \\"Kristin Fashion Show\\" (as proceeds are now divided between The Child Cancer Foundation and CanTeen). This event features some of New Zealand's top clothing labels, which are all modelled by Kristin students, who range in age from 5 to 18. Raffles and auctions are held during the show, again with all proceeds going to CanTeen and the Child Cancer Foundation. Every year the fashion show committee strives to find way to increase audience enjoyment, and the amount raised for these charities, in 2007 the show raised $30,000 NZD. Over the two nights of the show around 3,000 people will attend. The show relies entirely on sponsorship from the community, and gains no funding from Kristin School itself. The Kristin Fashion Show, after many years of running, had its finale show in June 2012. Kristin Robotics Kristin School has become part of a worldwide robotics competition known as VEX Robotics, along with many other schools on the North Shore. The entirely student organised team has been named K-Force and consists of students ranging from Year 7 to Year 13 who have put their name forward to become part of various sections of the organisation. More information about Kristin Robotics can be read on the K-Force Team Website. Euphony Euphony is Kristin's Senior School All-Girls Choir. The choir is composed of generally four vocal groups, SSAA, however it may vary between various pieces. Euphony often makes to the National Finale of \\"The Big Sing\\", winning various awards. In 2007, Euphony won a prestigious Gold award at the National Finale in Christchurch and in 2008 won a Silver award in Wellington. Euphony also won both a Gold award and the Youth Ambassadors award in 2010 at the National Finale in Auckland and stood apart from other choirs with their memorable piece \\"Tjak!\\". In 2011, the Big Sing National Finale was held in Wellington again and Euphony won a silver award. In 2012 Euphony won the inaugural award for the best recital by a female choir at the Auckland region of the Big Sing (and won this again in 2013), then went on to win a gold award at the finale in Wellington. In July 2013 Euphony represented New Zealand at the International Musical Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales, where the choir was placed 3rd in the open female choir category and 7th= in the senior children's choir category. In September 2013 Euphony went to the Big Sing National Finale and won a gold award. In 2014 Euphony attended the Big Sing Regionals in Auckland and won the inaugural award for the best recital by a female choir at the Auckland region of the Big Sing for the third time.

They were a popular live attraction, rivalling groups such as the Animals, although, despite releasing a clutch of singles and an album, their record sales never reflected this popularity. History Singer Arthur Wood, from whom the band took their name, was the eldest brother of Ronnie Wood (who later found fame with the Faces and Rolling Stones). Art Wood had been a vocalist with Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated for a short period during 1962, simultaneously fronting his own group, the Art Wood Combo. When keyboardist Jon Lord and guitarist Derek Griffiths from Red Bludd's Bluesicians joined the Art Wood Combo, the Artwoods were formed. With Keef Hartley, formerly with Rory Storm & the Hurricanes, joining on drums and Malcolm Pool from the Roadrunners joining as bassist, in December 1964 the band turned professional, securing a residency at London's 100 Club and signing a recording contract with Decca Records. Colin Martin joined from the band the Ingoes, who changed their name to the Blossom Toes. Colin went on to work at Radio 2 where he produced the like of Terry Wogan, Ken Bruce and Gloria Hunniford and was later appointed as Head of Music at the station. The intended debut single, a cover of Muddy Waters' \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", was shelved in favour of a rendition of an old Lead Belly song, \\"Sweet Mary\\". Although it didn't reach the charts, it got sufficient airplay to bring the band a lot of live work, including an appearance on the first live edition of Ready Steady Go!. Their second record, \\"Oh My Love\\", was another blues cover. Like its predecessor (and subsequent releases), it failed to chart. Their only chart single was \\"I Take What I Want\\", which reached No 28 on 8 May 1966. The Artwoods were dropped by Decca at the end of 1966, and they signed a one- record deal with Parlophone, but their release \\"What Shall I Do\\" also had no success. Later in 1967, a final \\"one-off\\" single appeared on the Fontana label, with the band billing itself as St. Valentine's Day Massacre; but by the time of its release the Artwoods had effectively ceased to exist. The Artwoods' early records today stand up well against the work of more successful groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds or the Birds (who included Art's younger brother Ronnie). But at the time they came out, despite appearances on programs like Ready, Steady, Go! their singles never seemed to connect with the record-buying public. The group broke up in mid-1967. Art Wood joined his brother Ted in the graphics-art business and continued to perform music on a semi-professional basis. He also played with the Downliners Sect. Keef Hartley went on to play with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and Jon Lord became a founder member of Deep Purple. Over the years, there have been two compilations released by the band. In 1983, 100 Oxford Street, including most of their mid-'60s singles and seven songs from Art Gallery, was released by Edsel Records. In 2000, Singles A's & B's, comprising the group's entire single and EP output, was released by Repertoire Records.

It is located on the famous Grand Place in Brussels, Belgium, opposite the Brussels City Museum. It is the only remaining medieval building of the Grand Place and is considered a masterpiece of civil Gothic architecture and more particularly of Brabantine Gothic. History =Gothic Town Hall= The oldest part of the present Town Hall is its east wing (to the left when facing the front). This wing, together with a shorter tower, was built and completed in 1420 under direction of Jacob van Thienen. Initially, future expansion of the building was not foreseen, however, the admission of the craft guilds into the traditionally patrician city government apparently spurred interest in providing more room for the building. As a result, a second, somewhat longer wing was built on to the existing structure, with Charles the Bold laying its first stone in 1444. This west wing was built by Guillaume (Willem) de Voghel who, in 1452, also built the Aula Magna at the Palace of Coudenberg. The facade is decorated with numerous statues representing nobles, saints, and allegorical figures. The present sculptures are reproductions; the older ones are in the city museum in the King's House across the Grand Place. The tower in Brabantine Gothic style emerged from the plans of Jan van Ruysbroek, the court architect of Philip the Good. By 1454, this tower, replacing the older one, was complete. Above the roof of the Town Hall, the square tower body narrows to a lavishly pinnacled octagonal openwork. Atop the spire, stands a 5-metre-high gilt metal statue of the archangel Michael, patron saint of Brussels, slaying a dragon or devil. The tower, its front archway and the main building's facade are conspicuously off- centre relative to one another. According to a legend, the architect, upon discovering this \\"error\\", leapt to his death from the tower. More likely, the asymmetry of the Town Hall was an accepted consequence of the scattered construction history and space constraints. =Classical wings= After the bombardment of Brussels in 1695, by a French army under the Duke of Villeroi, the resulting fire completely gutted the Town Hall, destroying the archives and the art collections. The interior was soon rebuilt, and the addition of two rear wings, in the Louis XIV style, transformed the L-shaped building into its present configuration: a quadrilateral with an inner courtyard, completed by Corneille Van Nerven in 1712. File:Hôtel de ville de Bruxelles - Cour 02.JPGNorth-west facade of the inner courtyard File:Hôtel de ville de Bruxelles - Cour 09.JPGSouth facade of the courtyard File:Hôtel de ville de Bruxelles - Cour 13.JPGThe Scheldt by Pierre-Denis Plumier =19th-century restorations= Brussels' Town Hall The Town Hall underwent many restoration campaigns throughout the 19th century, first under the direction of Tilman- François Suys, starting in 1840. The Gothic interior was later revised by Victor Jamaer in 1868, in the style of his mentor Viollet-le-Duc. It was at this time that most of the statues of the Town Hall were made. The interior halls were replenished with tapestries, paintings, and sculptures, largely representing subjects of importance in local and regional history.

In 1830, a provisional government assembled there during the Belgian Revolution, which provoked the separation of the Southern Netherlands from the Northern Netherlands, resulting in the formation of Belgium as it is known presently. At the start of World War I, as refugees flooded Brussels, the Town Hall served as a makeshift hospital. On 20 August 1914, the occupying German army arrived at the Grand Place and hoisted a German flag at the left side of the Town Hall. The Town Hall has been designated a historic monument since 9 March 1936. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998 as part of the registration of the Grand Place.

WIS 13 serves as a major north-south route connecting the communities of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin Rapids, Marshfield and Ashland. Highway 13 is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour from its northern/western terminus to Ashland at is eastern junction with U.S. Highway 2. The road also provides access to the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore off the Lake Superior shoreline at Bayfield. The highway is two-lane surface road with the exception of various urban multilane road sections.  Route description  = Wisconsin Dells to Marshfield = WIS 13 begins at I-90 / I-94 and passes east through Wisconsin Dells as an urban multilane highway, crossing US 12 and merging with WIS 16 and WIS 23 east through the city. WIS 13 then turns north, while WIS 23 heads east and WIS 16 heads south one mile (1.6 km) east of the city. WIS 13 follows the Wisconsin River north through Adams County, passing through Plainville, Adams and Friendship. The highway then crosses WIS 21 three miles (5 km) north of Friendship and finally passes through Cottonville, Big Flats and Rome before entering Wood County. In Wood County, WIS 13 crosses WIS 73 at four miles (6 km) east of Nekoosa before entering Wisconsin Rapids. WIS 13 joins WIS 54 south at the Riverview Expressway, a short bypass of the downtown area. The two highways split two miles (3 km) west of their join point and WIS 13 merges with WIS 73 north. At the junction with WIS 34, WIS 73 turns westerly via W. Grand Ave, and WIS 13 continues due northerly concurrent with WIS 34 for approximately 12 miles before interchanging with the US 10 freeway 3 miles west of Junction City at Exit 204. There, WIS 13 turns to follow US 10 west toward Marshfield, following the US 10 expressway bypassing Milladore, Blenker, and Auburndale. At Exit 186 (CTH A/Veterans Pkwy) on the south side of Marshfield, WIS 13 exits the US 10 expressway to head north into Marshfield on Veterans Pkwy. WIS 13 enters Marathon County after passing through Marshfield. The 4-lane road in Marshfield is also known as Veterans Parkway. This section was built to alleviate congestion in downtown Marshfield along Central Ave. Further, the city and WisDOT are reconstructing Central Avenue in 2009 before handing it over to city control.City of Marshfield - South Central Ave Reconstruction = Marshfield to Ashland = WIS 13 heads northwest to Spencer where it turns north to follow the Marathon/Clark county line, passing through Unity, Colby and Abbotsford (where it junctions with WIS 29) and around Dorchester. The highway then enters Taylor County where it passes through Stetsonville and crosses WIS 64 on the east side of Medford. North of Medford, WIS 13 meanders around Whittlesey, Chelsea and Westboro. The highway enters Price County two miles (3 km) north of Westboro. In Price County, WIS 13 reaches the WIS 86 terminus at Ogema and crosses US 8 near Prentice. The highway then turns northwest to Phillips. The route turns north again out of Phillips to head into Fifield where WIS 70 crosses. WIS 13 then meets WIS 182 at its terminus in Park Falls before heading northwest out of the county into Ashland County. WIS 13 passes through Butternut and Glidden upon entering the county. Two miles northwest of Glidden, the highway joins with WIS 77 north and the two highways head north, passing through Cayuga and split with WIS 77 heading east at Mellen and WIS 13 heading northwest, passing through Highbridge, Minersville and Marengo. WIS 13 then heads north to Ashland and joins US 2 west for two miles (3 km) and then turns north (as US 2 continues west) along the Lake Superior shoreline in Bayfield County = Along the Lake Superior shoreline (Ashland to Superior) = WIS 13 closely follows the shore of Chequamegon Bay and passes through Barksdale, Washburn and Bayfield. It is at Bayfield where access to Madeline Island and the Apostle Island National Lakeshore is available. WIS 13 turns westward at Red Cliff and follows the shore of Lake Superior, passing through Cornucopia, Herbster, and Port Wing, before entering Douglas County. One mile after the county line, WIS 13 turns southward to parallel the Brule River State Forest for five miles (8 km), then turns west again. The highway ends at US 2 and US 53 southeast of Superior.  History  With some variation due to realignments over time, the original 1918 routing this highway followed much of today's STH 13, beginning at what was then Kilbourn (present-day Wisconsin Dells), travelling north through Adams, Grand Rapids (now Wisconsin Rapids), Marshfield, Prentice and Ashland, ending in Bayfield. It was later that STH 13 was routed around the Bayfield Peninsula and westerly to just before Superior. STH 13 ends in the Town of Parkland at CTH Z. The route of STH 13 previously ran the length of the state from Beloit on the Illinois state line to the Minnesota state line. From Beloit, Highway 13 followed the roads that are now U.S. Highway 51, U.S. Highway 14, U.S. Highway 12 through Janesville and Madison. Additionally, STH 13 was extended westerly from Bayfield first to Port Wing, then into Superior then across the border to Duluth. In the 1920s, the southern end of highway 13 was realigned from Evansville to Beloit along what is now WIS 213 after US 14 was commissioned. Highway 13 was truncated to its present southern terminus in 1961 after I-90 and I-94 were commissioned. As of late August 2012, WIS 13 was removed as a concurrency with WIS 73 between Wisconsin Rapids and Marshfield. WIS 13 now departs Wisconsin Rapids concurrent with WIS 34 to the new US 10 expressway west of Junction City, and then follows the new US 10 west to Marshfield.  Major intersections   Special routes  Two special routes exist for WIS 13. The first, in Wisconsin Rapids, runs downtown from Riverview Expressway (WIS 13 and WIS 54) along North 8th Street, then west along Avon Street, Jackson Street and West Grand Avenue, ending at the junction of WIS 34, WIS 13 and WIS 73. The second, in Marshfield, follows the old alignment of WIS 13 along Central Avenue through downtown.

During his term, Glenn Dale Cunningham, the only African American mayor of Jersey City, brought attention to the work and collection of the small museum.

Campbell was born in the British military hospital in Ismailia, Egypt, and lived in Kenya till 1962, so was exposed to indigenous Arab and African music before its alteration by western influence. He studied Stravinsky and formed the progressive rock band Egg in 1968 with Dave Stewart and Clive Brooks. In 1972 he studied composition at the Royal College of Music, gaining an ARCM diploma in 1974. He composed the score to David Anderson's BAFTA-winning animated film Dreamland Express in 1983 and began a full-time career as composer in 1989 with film and commercials commissions from Redwing Films. He has since written scores for film, television, advertising, radio and stage. He is adept on a wide range of ethnic folk instruments which have led to recording work in film, television and computer games. He has created or contributed to several instrumental sound libraries (production music) distributed by ILIO Entertainments, World Winds, Origins, Music House, SOHO, Production Music Online, and others. Although initially known as a member of progressive rock bands such as Egg and National Health, Campbell would later (in his own words) \\"(forswear) the genre of rock music altogether, and began to develop an interest in folk tradition and, increasingly, non-western music.\\" Originally a bass guitarist, he is now a multi-instrumentalist specialising in wind instruments from around the world, including period folk instruments. In parallel to his work as a musician, Campbell is a director of the Sussex-based alternative energy company, Ovesco.  Biography  =Early years= Born to Mary Elizabeth Shaw (\\"Jackie\\") and Lieutenant Colonel H.A.L. Montgomery Campbell of the Royal Tank Regiment (\\"Archie\\"), in Ismaïlia, Egypt, Campbell was named Martin after his grandfather, the composer Martin Shaw. The family moved to Kenya in 1951, where they lived until their return to the UK in 1962, their son having preceded them by a year. In 1966, the family moved from Brighton to London where Campbell (already equipped with his long-standing nickname of \\"Mont\\") attended the City of London Boys School. While at school, Campbell (playing guitar and French horn) met and began to work with aspiring keyboard player Dave Stewart and budding guitarist Steve Hillage. Recruiting the latter to one of his bands prompted Campbell to switch his own focus to bass guitar.Mont Campbell biography on Calyx =Rock musician (1968–1976)= In early 1968, Campbell, Stewart and Hillage formed the short-lived psychedelic blues band Uriel with drummer Clive Brooks. Following Hillage's departure, the remaining trio took on a progressive rock direction and changed the band name to Egg. (They would, however, briefly reunite with Hillage to record an album under the project name of Arzachel, on which each member employed an arcane surname both for fun and to get around contractual problems). Between 1970 and 1971 Egg recorded their debut album and its follow-up The Polite Force. Campbell played bass guitar in the group (as well as singing and adding French horn) and was also its main composer, citing Igor Stravinsky as his main influence. He has, however, subsequently expressed reservations about his later time with the band (saying of The Polite Force, \\"I didn't enjoy the sessions which seemed to me turgid and unsatisfying. I don't like the album.\\"'Arzachel and Egg interview with Mont Campbell', Psychedelic Baby magazine) All Egg members also played and composed for the Ottawa Music Co., a large ensemble co-led by Dave Stewart and Chris Cutler between 1971 and 1972, which brought together members of Egg, Henry Cow and Khan, along with other composers and instrumentalists. Cutler recalls the ensemble playing Campbell's \\"Study for Four Keyboards\\", \\"Enneagram\\", and \\"Three Pieces for Wind Quartet\\" (and also that Campbell, during the last OMC show, \\"(swung) across the stage on a rope shouting 'It's a mug's game'.\\")Chris Cutler's reminiscences of Ottawa Music Co. on Chris Cutler homepage Persistently struggling to maintain their record deal with Deram, Egg amicably disbanded in 1972. By this time Campbell had become interested in mysticism and was involved in the international spiritual movement Subud. Having unsuccessfully pursued work as a plumber and as a graphic designer, he was invited to compose music for a film by director David Anderson: this in turn led to him attending the Royal College of Music, studying the French horn and composition and gaining his ARCM diploma in 1974. With mixed feelings about his academic studies, he reunited with his former Egg bandmates for their final album The Civil Surface (also in 1974), which consisted of unreleased material written in 1971–72, including what many view as Campbell's masterpiece in the progressive rock canon, Enneagram. The album was bolstered by two Campbell-composed wind quartets (which featured neither Stewart nor Brooks). During this period, Campbell maintained a connection with the Canterbury scene movement of which Egg had been a part, playing and recording as a support musician for Henry Cow, Hatfield & The North, Slapp Happy and others. Following graduation (and after a very brief stint with Alan Gowen's jazz fusion band GilgameshGilgamesh biography on Calyx), Campbell linked up with Stewart again in 1975, this time as part of the original line- up of National Health, Although Campbell initially enjoyed his work with the band (for which he composed several pieces including \\"Paracelsus\\", \\"Agrippa\\", \\"Zabaglione\\" and \\"Starlight on Seaweed\\"), within a year he became disheartened by its lack of success. He left the band in June 1976 after a UK tour, a radio session for the BBC and a \\"disastrous\\" performance at a one-off French festival (the latter being his final appearance with the group). Although National Health secured a recording contract following his departure, Campbell's compositions would be dropped from the set: recordings of them would not surface until twenty years later on the archive collection \\"Missing Pieces\\". =World musician (1977–present)= Campbell's final gig with National Health resulted in a total discouragement with rock music, and in subsequent years he would abandon the genre altogether, describing it as having \\"very limited powers of expression... a rather fixed, limited stratum of musical experience, and one that I no longer feel particularly drawn to.\\" In 1977, he dropped his old school nickname of \\"Mont\\" in favour of \\"Dirk\\" and formed the two-guitar, flute and violin quartet Mozaic, which mostly played \\"pleasant, undemanding\\" Campbell pieces at weddings and social events. He also recorded an (ultimately unreleased) tape of other compositions, called Individual Extracts. In 1983, Campbell developed an overwhelming interest in world music and spent most of the next decade-and-a-half mastering a wide variety of wind instruments, harps and lutes from diverse cultures around the world. This led to an ongoing career as a specialist session musician and composer for films, theatre and television, including work with the Royal Shakespeare Company and contributions to The Last King of Scotland, Long Walk to Freedom, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, State of Play, the 2008 revival of Survivors and the 2017 film of The Mummy. He has enjoyed a run of cinema collaborations with his 1970s creative partner David Anderson, including Dreamland Express, In the Time of Angels and Deutsche Post.Dirk Campbell page on Classical Matters Campbell released his first solo album, Music from a Round Tower in 1996 (a mixture of authentic traditional instrumentation with MIDI, sampling and sequencing, plus contributions from Dave Stewart). Despite declaring in 2004 that he \\"personally (had) nothing to say in the western musical language\\" Campbell followed it up in 2009 with Music from a Walled Garden. He has gone on to record as half of The World Wind Band (the other half being fellow multi-wind player Jan Hendrickse) and currently plays and composes as part of the \\"non-European folk\\" band Kalamus, which he has described as \\"mostly flute and bagpipe music with percussion\\" and which released their first album Bronze in 2011. In January 2009 Campbell appeared on British television in the BBC documentary Prog Rock Britannia: An Observation in Three Movements, reminiscing about Egg and the progressive rock movement in general. Multi-instrumental abilities Campbell is a diverse multi-instrumentalist. During his time as a rock musician he predominantly played electric bass guitar, six-string electric guitar and electric piano, but has mostly abandoned these instruments since his retirement from rock music. He is an occasional singer and, on his solo albums, has worked with digital age music technology (sampling, programming and MIDI). Since Campbells's reinvention as a world music and historical musical specialist, he has focussed predominantly on acoustic instrumentation and plays around forty different instruments, including:Instrument details on biography, Dirk Campbell homepage *horns (French horn, ancient Roman cornu, animal horns, \\"primitive trumpets\\") *side-blown/transverse flutes (Western concert flute, Irish flute, Indian bansuri, Fula tambin) *end-blown flutes (Southeast Asian suling, Persian ney, Balkan/Turkish kaval *ducted/fipple flutes (tin whistle, Slovakian fujara, Kenyan filimbi, Native American flute) *single reed woodwind instruments (clarinet, Egyptian/Palestinian arghul, Arabic mijwiz) *double reed woodwind instruments (Turkish/Balkan zurna, Armenian duduk, European shawm, Indian shehnai) *bagpipes (Great Highland bagpipe, Irish uilleann pipes, French cornemuse, Balkan gaida, Hungarian dudy, Italian zampogna, North African mezoued, medieval/early English bagpipes) *harps (West African kora, Gaelic clàrsach) *assorted lutes *east African nyatiti lyre *unspecified percussion Work in energy provision Campbell also pursues parallel work as an environmentalist and alternative energy specialist. He is a founding director of the Ouse Valley Energy Services Company (Ovesco), which began its work by initiating a solar power station in Campbell's current hometown of Lewes and has since expanded to cover further sustainable energy projects in the Ouse Valley region. Family life His partner Adrienne died in 2012. Campbell has one son and six daughters, one of whom, Anna Campbell, was killed in 2018 fighting for the Kurdish Women's Protection Units in Syria.

Goldhagen argues that eliminationist antisemitism was the cornerstone of German national identity, was unique to Germany, and because of it ordinary German conscripts killed Jews willingly. Goldhagen asserts that this mentality grew out of medieval attitudes rooted in religion and was later secularized. The book challenges several common ideas about the Holocaust that Goldhagen believes to be myths. These \\"myths\\" include the idea that most Germans did not know about the Holocaust; that only the SS, and not average members of the Wehrmacht, participated in murdering Jews; and that genocidal antisemitism was a uniquely Nazi ideology without historical antecedents. The book, which began as a Harvard doctoral dissertation, was written largely as an answer to Christopher Browning's 1992 book Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland. Much of Goldhagen's book is concerned with the actions of the same Reserve Battalion 101 of the Nazi German Ordnungspolizei and his narrative challenges numerous aspects of Browning's book. Goldhagen had already indicated his opposition to Browning's thesis in a review of Ordinary Men in the July 13, 1992, edition of The New Republic titled \\"The Evil of Banality\\". His doctoral dissertation, The Nazi Executioners: A Study of Their Behavior and the Causation of Genocide, won the American Political Science Association's 1994 Gabriel A. Almond Award for the best dissertation in the field of comparative politics. Goldhagen's book stoked controversy and debate in Germany and the United States. Some historians have characterized its reception as an extension of the Historikerstreit, the German historiographical debate of the 1980s that sought to explain Nazi history. The book was a \\"publishing phenomenon\\", achieving fame in both the United States and Germany, despite its \\"mostly scathing\\" reception among historians, who were unusually vocal in condemning it as ahistorical and, in the words of Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, \\"totally wrong about everything\\" and \\"worthless\\". Published by the Central European University, based on a public lecture series. Hitler's Willing Executioners won the Democracy Prize of the Journal for German and International Politics. The Harvard Gazette asserted that the selection was the result of Goldhagen's book having \\"helped sharpen public understanding about the past during a period of radical change in Germany\\".. The Evil of Banality In 1992, the American historian Christopher Browning published a book titled Ordinary Men about the Reserve Police Battalion 101, which had been used in 1942 to massacre and round up Jews for deportation to the Nazi death camps in German-occupied Poland. The conclusion of the book, which was much influenced by the Milgram experiment on obedience, was that the men of Unit 101 were not demons or Nazi fanatics but ordinary middle-aged men of working-class background from Hamburg, who had been drafted but found unfit for military duty. In the course of the murderous Operation Reinhard, these men were ordered to round up Jews, and if there was not enough room for them on the trains, to shoot them. In other, more chilling cases, they were ordered simply to kill a specified number of Jews in a given town or area. In one instance, the commander of the unit gave his men the choice of opting out of this duty if they found it too unpleasant; the majority chose not to exercise that option, resulting in fewer than 15 men out of a battalion of 500 opting out. Browning argued that the men of Unit 101 agreed willingly to participate in massacres out of a basic obedience to authority and peer pressure, not blood-lust or primal hatred.Browning, Chris. Ordinary Men : Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland, New York : HarperCollins, 1992. p. 57 In his review of Ordinary Men published in July 1992,Goldhagen, Daniel (July 1992), \\"The Evil of Banality\\" (excerpts from Goldhagen's Review, H-NET List on German History). Originally in The New Republic, July 13–20, 1992. Retrieved June 15, 2014. Goldhagen expressed agreement with several of Browning's findings, namely, that the killings were not, as many people believe, done entirely by SS men, but also by Trawnikis; that the men of Unit 101 had the option not to kill, and - a point Goldhagen emphasizes - that no German was ever punished in any serious way for refusing to kill Jews.Goldhagen (1992), p.49. But Goldhagen disagreed with Browning's \\"central interpretation\\" that the killing was done in the context of the ordinary sociological phenomenon of obedience to authority. Goldhagen instead contended that \\"for the vast majority of the perpetrators a monocausal explanation does suffice\\".Guttenplan, D. D. (2002), The Holocaust on Trial (Google Books preview) W. W. Norton, p.214. . They were not ordinary men as we usually understand men to be, but \\"ordinary members of an extraordinary political culture, the culture of Nazi Germany, which was possessed of a hallucinatory, lethal view of the Jews. That view was the mainspring of what was, in essence, voluntary barbarism.\\"Goldhagen (1992), pp.51–52. Goldhagen stated that he would write a book that would rebut Ordinary Men and Browning's thesis, and prove instead that it was the murderous antisemitic nature of German culture that led the men of Reserve Battalion 101 to murder Jews. Goldhagen's thesis In Hitler's Willing Executioners Goldhagen argued that Germans possessed a unique form of antisemitism, which he called \\"eliminationist antisemitism,\\" a virulent ideology stretching back through centuries of German history. Under its influence the vast majority of Germans wanted to eliminate Jews from German society, and the perpetrators of the Holocaust did what they did because they thought it was \\"right and necessary.\\" For Goldhagen the Holocaust, in which so many Germans participated, must be explained as a result of the specifically German brand of antisemitism. German) the presence of Judensau images on churches of central Europe; the ones that were removed marked in red Goldhagen charged that every other book written on the Holocaust was flawed by the fact that historians had treated Germans in the Third Reich as \\"more or less like us,\\" wrongly believing that \\"their sensibilities had remotely approximated our own.\\"Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, Alfred Knopf: New York, 1996 pp. 27, 269. Instead, Goldhagen argued that historians should examine ordinary Germans of the Nazi period in the same way they examined the Aztecs who believed in the necessity of human sacrifice to appease the gods and ensure that the sun would rise every day.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, Alfred Knopf: New York, 1996 p. 28. His thesis, he said, was based on the assumption that Germans were not a \\"normal\\" Western people influenced by the values of the Enlightenment. His approach would be anthropological, treating Germans the same way that an anthropologist would describe preindustrial people who believed in absurd things such as trees having magical powers.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, Alfred Knopf: New York, 1996 pp. 28, 30. Goldhagen's book was meant to be an anthropological \\"thick description\\" in the manner of Clifford Geertz.Clendinnean, Inga Reading the Holocaust, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999 p. 117. The violent antisemitic \\"cultural axiom\\" held by Martin Luther in the 16th century and expressed in his 1543 book On the Jews and Their Lies, according to Goldhagen, were the same as those held by Adolf Hitler in the 20th century.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf 1996 p. 284. He argued that such was the ferocity of German \\"eliminationist antisemitism\\" that the situation in Germany had been \\"pregnant with murder\\" regarding the Jews since the mid-19th century and that all Hitler did was merely to unleash the deeply rooted murderous \\"eliminationist antisemitism\\" that had been brooding within the German people since at least Luther's time, if not earlier.Rosenbaum, Ron Explaining Hitler, New York: HarperCollins, 1998 p. 339. Title page of Martin Luther's On the Jews and Their Lies. Wittenberg, 1543. Goldhagen used Luther's book to argue for the deep-rooted unique \\"eliminationist\\" antisemitism of German culture. Hitler's Willing Executioners marked a revisionist challenge to the prevailing orthodoxy surrounding the question of German public opinion and the Final Solution.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf, 1996 pp. 8–9 The British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, a leading expert in the social history of the Third Reich, wrote, \\"The road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference,\\"Evans, Richard In Hitler's Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 p. 71Marrus, Michael The Holocaust in History, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2000 p. 91. that is, that the progress leading up to Auschwitz was motivated by a vicious form of antisemitism on the part of the Nazi elite, but that it took place in a context where the majority of German public opinion was indifferent to what was happening.Browning, Christopher \\"Afterword\\", Ordinary Men, New York: HarperCollins, 1998 pp. 200–201. In several articles and books, most notably his 1983 book Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich, Kershaw argued that most Germans were at a minimum at least vaguely aware of the Holocaust, but did not much care about what their government was doing to the Jews.Marrus, Michael The Holocaust in History, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2000 pp. 90–91. Other historians, such as the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka, the Israeli historian David Bankier, and the American historian Aron Rodrigue, while differing from Kershaw over many details about German public opinion, arguing that the term \\"passive complicity\\" is a better description than \\"indifference\\", have largely agreed with Kershaw that there was a chasm of opinion about the Jews between the Nazi \\"true believers\\" and the wider German public, whose views towards Jews seemed to have expressed more of a dislike than a hatred. Goldhagen, in contrast, declared the term \\"indifference\\" to be unacceptable, contending that the vast majority of Germans were active antisemitics who wanted to kill Jews in the most \\"pitiless\\" and \\"callous\\" manner possible.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf, 1996 pp. 439–440. As such, to prove his thesis Goldhagen focused on the behavior of ordinary Germans who killed Jews, especially the behavior of the men of Order Police Reserve Battalion 101 in Poland in 1942 to argue ordinary Germans possessed by \\"eliminationist antisemitism\\" chose to willingly murder Jews.Clendinnean, Inga Reading the Holocaust, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999 pp. 115–117. The 450 or so men of Battalion 101 were mostly middle-aged, working-class men from Hamburg who showed little interest in National Socialism and who had no special training to prepare them for genocide.Clendinnean, Inga Reading the Holocaust, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999 p. 119. Despite their very different interpretations of Battalion 101, both Browning and Goldhagen have argued that the men of the unit were a cross-sample of ordinary Germans. Using Geertz's anthropological methods, Goldhagen argued by studying the men of Battalion 101 one could engage in a \\"thick description\\" of the German \\"eliminationist antisemitic\\" culture.Clendinnean, Inga Reading the Holocaust, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999 pp. 117–118. Contra Browning, Goldhagen argued that the men of Battalion 101 were not reluctant killers, but instead willingly murdered Polish Jews in the most cruel and sadistic manner possible, that \\"brutality and cruelty\\" were central to the ethos of Battalion 101.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf 1996 pp. 256–257. In its turn, the \\"culture of cruelty\\" in Battalion 101 was linked by Goldhagen to the culture of \\"eliminationist antisemitism\\".Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf 1996 pp. 254–256. Goldhagen noted that the officers in charge of Battalion 101 led by Major Wilhem Trapp allowed the men to excuse themselves from killing if they found it too unpleasant, and Goldhagen used the fact that the vast majority of the men of Battalion 101 did not excuse themselves to argue that this proved the murderous antisemitic nature of German culture.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf 1996 pp. 249–253. Goldhagen argued for the specific antisemitic nature of Battalion 101's violence by noting that in 1942 the battalion was ordered to shoot 200 Gentile Poles, and instead shot 78 Polish Catholics while shooting 180 Polish Jews later that same day.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf 1996 p. 240. Goldhagen used this incident to argue the men of Battalion 101 were reluctant to kill Polish Catholics, but only too willing to murder Polish Jews. Goldhagen wrote the men of Battalion 101 felt \\"joy and triumph\\" after torturing and murdering Jews.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf 1996 p. 261. Goldhagen used antisemitic statements by Cardinal Adolf Bertram as typical of what he called the Roman Catholic Church's support for genocide.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf 1996 pp. 453-454. Goldhagen was later to expand on what he sees as the Catholic Church's institutional antisemitism and support for the Nazi regime in Hitler's Willing Executioners's sequel, 2002's A Moral Reckoning. Goldhagen argued that it \\"strains credibility\\" to imagine that \\"ordinary Danes or Italians\\" could have acted as he claimed ordinary Germans did during the Holocaust to prove that \\"eliminationist\\" anti-Semitism was uniquely German.Goldhagen, Daniel Hitler's Willing Executioners, New York: Alfred Knopf 1996 p. 408. Reception What some commentators termed \\"The Goldhagen Affair\\" began in late 1996, when Goldhagen visited Berlin to participate in debate on television and in lecture halls before capacity crowds, on a book tour.Cowell, Alan. (September 8, 1996). Author goes to Berlin to debate Holocaust. The New York Times. Accessed January 4, 2008.Elon, Amos. (January 26, 1997). The antagonist as liberator The New York Times.

Legacies of Dachau. 2001, p. 381 Many media voices noted that, while the book launched passionate national discussion about the Holocaust,Landler, Mark. (November 14, 2002) Holocaust writer in storm over role of Catholic Church The New York Times. Accessed January 4, 2008. this discussion was carried out civilly and respectfully. Goldhagen's book tour became, in the opinion of some German media voices, \\"a triumphant march\\", as \\"the open-mindedness that Goldhagen encountered in the land of the perpetrators\\" was \\"gratifying\\" and something of which Germans ought to be proud, even in the context of a book which sought, according to some critics, to \\"erase the distinction between Germans and Nazis\\".Art, David. The Politics of the Nazi Past in Germany and Austria. 2006, pp. 88–9 Goldhagen was awarded the Democracy Prize in 1997 by the German Journal for German and International Politics, which asserted that \\"because of the penetrating quality and the moral power of his presentation, Daniel Goldhagen has greatly stirred the consciousness of the German public.\\" The laudatio, awarded for the first time since 1990, was given by Jürgen Habermas and Jan Philipp Reemtsma. Elie Wiesel praised the work as something every German schoolchild should read. Debate about Goldhagen's theory has been intense. Detractors have contended that the book is \\"profoundly flawed\\" or \\"bad history\\".Caplan, Jane. Nazi Germany. 2008, p. 18 Some historians have criticized or simply dismissed the text, citing among other deficiencies Goldhagen's \\"neglect of decades of research in favour of his own preconceptions\\", which he proceeds to articulate in an \\"intemperate, emotional, and accusatory tone\\". In 1997 the German historian Hans Mommsen gave an interview in which he said that Goldhagen had a poor understanding of the diversities of German antisemitism, that he construed \\"a unilinear continuity of German anti-semitism from the medieval period onwards\\" with Hitler as its end result, whereas, said Mommsen, it is obvious that Hitler's antisemitic propaganda had no significant impact on the election campaigns between September 1930 and November 1932 and on his coming to power, a crucial phenomenon ignored by Goldhagen. Goldhagen's one-dimensional view of German antisemitism also ignores the specific impact of the völkisch antisemitism as proclaimed by Houston Stuart Chamberlain and the Richard Wagner movement which directly influenced Hitler as well as the Nazi party. Finally, Mommsen criticizes Goldhagen for errors in his understanding of the internal structure of the Third Reich. In the interview Mommsen distinguished three varieties of German antisemitism. \\"Cultural antisemitism,\\" directed primarily against the Eastern Jews, was part of the \\"cultural code\\" of German conservatives, who were mainly found in the German officer corps and the high civil administration. It stifled protests by conservatives against persecutions of the Jews, as well as Hitler's proclamation of a \\"racial annihilation war\\" against the Soviet Union. The Catholic Church maintained its own \\"silent anti-Judaism\\" which \\"immuniz[ed] the Catholic population against the escalating persecution\\" and kept the Church from protesting against persecution of the Jews, even while it did protest against the euthanasia program. Third was the so-called völkisch antisemitism or racism, the most vitriolic form, the foremost advocate of using violence. Christopher Browning wrote in response to Goldhagen's criticism of him in the 1998 \\"Afterword\\" to Ordinary Men published by HarperCollins: About Goldhagen's claims that the men of Order Police Reserve Battalion 101 were reluctant to kill Polish Catholics while being eager to kill Polish Jews, Browning accused Goldhagen of having double standards with the historical evidence.Browning, Christopher \\"Afterword\\", Ordinary Men, New York: HarperCollins, 1998 p. 212. Browning wrote: About the long-term origins of the Holocaust, Browning argued that by the end of the 19th century, antisemitism was widely accepted by most German conservatives and that virtually all German conservatives supported the Nazi regime's antisemitic laws of 1933–34 (and the few who did object like President Hindenburg only objected to the inclusion of Jewish war veterans in the antisemitic laws that they otherwise supported) but that left to their own devices, would not have gone further and that for all their fierce anti- Semitism, German conservatives would not have engaged in genocide.Browning, Christopher \\"Afterword\\", Ordinary Men, New York: HarperCollins, 1998 p. 197. Browning also contended that the long prior to 1933 antisemitism of German conservative elites in the military and the bureaucracy meant that they made few objections, moral or otherwise to the Nazi/völkisch antisemitism. Browning was echoing the conclusions of the German conservative historian Andreas Hillgruber who once presented at a historians' conference in 1984 a counter- factual scenario whereby, had it been a coalition of the German National People's Party and Der Stahlhelm that took power in 1933 without the NSDAP, all the antisemitic laws in Germany that were passed between 1933 and 1938 would still have occurred but there would have been no Holocaust.Hillgruber, Andreas, \\"Jürgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Janßen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\", Piper, Ernst (Ed.), Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler?, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993, p. 225. The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer wrote that Goldhagen's thesis about a murderous antisemitic culture applied better to Romania than to Germany and murderous anti-Semitism was not confined to Germany as Goldhagen had claimed.Bauer, Yehuda Rethinking the Holocaust, Yale: New Haven, 2000 p. 107. Bauer wrote of the main parties of the Weimar Coalition that dominated German politics until 1930, the leftist SPD and the liberal DDP were opposed to anti-Semitism while the right-of-the- centre Catholic Zentrum was \\"moderately\\" antisemitic.Bauer, Yehuda Rethinking the Holocaust, Yale: New Haven, 2000 p. 101. Bauer wrote of the major pre-1930 political parties, the only party that could be described as radically antisemitic was the conservative German National People's Party, who Bauer called \\"... the party of the traditional, often radical anti-Semitic elites...\\" who were \\"... a definite minority\\" while the NSDAP won only 2.6% of the vote in the Reichstag elections in May 1928. Bauer charged that it was the Great Depression, not an alleged culture of murderous anti-Semitism that allowed the NSDAP to make its electoral breakthrough in the Reichstag elections of September 1930. Despite having a generally critical view of Goldhagen, Bauer wrote that the final chapters of Hitler's Willing Executioners dealing with the death marches were \\"... the best part of the book. Little is new in the overall description, but the details and the way he analyzes the attitude of the murderers is powerful and convincing\\".Bauer, Yehuda Rethinking the Holocaust, Yale: New Haven, 2000 p. 108. Finally Bauer charged \\"... that the anti-German bias of his book, almost a racist bias (however much he may deny it) leads nowhere\\". Concerning Order Police Reserve Battalion 101, the Australian historian Inga Clendinnen wrote that Goldhagen's picture of Major Trapp, the unit's commander as an antisemitic fanatic was \\"far-fetched\\" and \\"... there is no indication, on that first day or later that he found the murdering of Jewish civilians a congenial task\\".Clendinnean, Inga \\"The Men in the Green Tunics\\", Reading the Holocaust, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999 p. 122. Clendinnean wrote that Goldhagen's attempt to \\"... blame the Nazis' extreme and gratuitous savagery\\" on the Germans was \\"unpersuasive\\", and the pogroms that killed thousands of Jews committed by Lithuanian mobs in the summer of 1941, shortly after the arrival of German troops, suggested murderous anti-Semitism was not unique to Germany.Clendinnean, Inga \\"The Men in the Green Tunics\\", Reading the Holocaust, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999 pp 130. Clendinnean ended her essay by stating she found Browning's account of Battalion 101 to be the more believable.Clendinnean, Inga \\"The Men in the Green Tunics\\", Reading the Holocaust, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999 p. 132. The Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that to accept Goldhagen's thesis would also have to mean accepting that the entire German Jewish community was \\"downright stupid\\" from the mid-19th century onwards because it is otherwise impossible to explain why they chose to remain in Germany, if the people were so murderously hostile or why so many German Jews wanted to assimilate into an \\"eliminationist anti-Semitic\\" culture.Bartov, Omer Germany's War and the Holocaust Cornell: Cornell University Press, 2003 p. 127. In a 1996 review in First Things, the American Catholic priest Father Richard John Neuhaus took issue with Goldhagen's claim that the Catholic and Lutheran churches in Germany were genocidal towards the Jews, arguing that there was a difference between Christian and Nazi anti-Semitism. Neuhaus argued that Goldhagen was wrong to claim that Luther had created a legacy of intense, genocidal anti- Semitism within Lutheranism, asking why, if that were the case, would so many people in solidly Lutheran Denmark act to protect the Danish Jewish minority from deportation to the death camps in 1943. The Canadian historian Peter Hoffmann accused Goldhagen of maligning Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, arguing that Goldhagen had taken wildly out of context the list of Jewish doctors forbidden to practice that Goerdeler as Lord Mayor of Leipzig had issued in April 1935. Hoffmann contended that what happened was that on April 9, 1935, the Deputy Mayor of Leipzig, the National Socialist Rudolf Haake, banned all Jewish doctors from participating in public health insurance and advised all municipal employees not to consult Jewish doctors, going beyond the existing antisemitic laws then in place.Hoffmann, Peter \\"The German Resistance and the Holocaust\\" p. 105-126 from Confront! Resistance in Nazi Germany edited by John J. Michalczyk, New York: Peter Lang Publishers, 2004 p. 113 In response, the Landesverband Mitteldeutschland des Centralvereins deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens e. V (Middle German Regional Association of the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith) complained to Goerdeler about Haake's actions and asked him to enforce the existing antisemitic laws, which at least allowed some Jewish doctors to practice. On 11 April 1935, Goerdeler ordered the end of Haake's boycott, and provided a list of \\"non-Aryan\\" physicians permitted to operate under the existing laws and those who were excluded.Hoffmann, Peter \\"The German Resistance and the Holocaust\\", Confront! Resistance in Nazi Germany edited by John J. Michalczyk, New York: Peter Lang Publishers, 2004 p. 113-114. Others have contended that, despite the book's \\"undeniable flaws\\", it \\"served to refocus the debate on the question of German national responsibility and guilt\\", in the context of a re-emergence of a German political right, which may have sought to \\"relativize\\" or \\"normalize\\" Nazi history. Goldhagen's assertion that almost all Germans \\"wanted to be genocidal executioners\\" has been viewed with skepticism by most historians, a skepticism ranging from dismissal as \\"not valid social science\\" to a condemnation, in the words of the Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer, as \\"patent nonsense\\". \\"[thesis] shredded by many professional historians\\" Common complaints suggest that Goldhagen's primary hypothesis is either \\"oversimplified\\", \\"Most professional historians welcome [the book's] questions about the role of ordinary people in the holocaust, but rejected the charge of \\"eliminationist anti-Semitism\\" inherent in German culture as somewhat oversimplified. or represents \\"a bizarre inversion of the Nazi view of the Jews\\" turned back upon the Germans. One German commentator suggested that Goldhagen's book \\"pushes us again and again headfirst into the nasty anti- Semitic mud. This is his revenge...\\"Holtschneider, K. Hannah. German Protestants Remember the Holocaust. 2001, p. 99 Eberhard Jäckel wrote a very hostile book review in the Die Zeit newspaper in May 1996 that called Hitler's Willing Executioners \\"simply a bad book\\".Kershaw, Sir Ian The Nazi dictatorship: problems and perspectives of interpretation London: Arnold 2000 p. 255. The British historian Sir Ian Kershaw wrote that he fully agreed with Jäckel on the merits of Hitler's Willing Executioners\\". Kershaw wrote in 2000 that Goldhagen's book would \\"... occupy only a limited place in the unfolding, vast historiography of such a crucially important topic-probably at best as a challenge to historians to qualify or counter his 'broad-brush' generalisations\\".Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship, London: Arnold p. 258. In 1996, the American historian David Schoenbaum wrote a highly critical book review in the National Review of Hitler's Willing Executioners where he charged Goldhagen with grossly simplifying the question of the degree and virulence of German Antisemitism, and of only selecting evidence that supported his thesis.. Furthermore, Schoenbaum complained that Goldhagen did not take a comparative approach with Germany placed in isolation, thereby falsely implying that Germans and Germans alone were the only nation that saw widespread antisemitism. Finally, Schoenbaum argued that Goldhagen failed to explain why the anti-Jewish boycott of April 1, 1933 was relatively ineffective or why the Kristallnacht needed to be organized by the Nazis as opposed to being a spontaneous expression of German popular antisemitism. Using an example from his family history, Schoenbaum wrote that his mother in law, a Polish Jew who lived in Germany between 1928–47, never considered the National Socialists and the Germans synonymous, and expressed regret that Goldhagen could not see the same. Hitler's Willing Executioners also drew controversy with the publication of two critical articles: \\"Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's 'Crazy' Thesis\\", by the American political science professor Norman Finkelstein and initially published in the UK political journal New Left Review, and \\"Historiographical review: Revising the Holocaust\\", written by the Canadian historian Ruth Bettina Birn and initially published in the Historical Journal of Cambridge. These articles were later published as the book A Nation on Trial: The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth. In response to their book, Goldhagen sought a retraction and apology from Birn, threatening at one point to sue her for libel and according to Salon declaring Finkelstein \\"a supporter of Hamas\\". The force of the counterattacks against Birn and Finkelstein from Goldhagen's supporters was described by Israeli journalist Tom Segev as \\"bordering on cultural terrorism ... The Jewish establishment has embraced Goldhagen as if he were Mr Holocaust himself ... All this is absurd, because the criticism of Goldhagen is backed up so well.\\" The Austrian-born American historian Raul Hilberg has stated that Goldhagen is \\"totally wrong about everything. Totally wrong. Exceptionally wrong.\\" Hilberg also wrote in an open letter on the eve of the book launch at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum that \\"The book is advertised as something that will change our thinking. It can do nothing of the sort. To me it is worthless, all the hype by the publisher notwithstanding\\". Yehuda Bauer was similarly condemnatory, questioning how an institute such as Harvard could award a doctorate for a work which so \\"slipped through the filter of critical scholarly assessment\\".Lamont, William. Historical Controversies and Historians. 1998, p. 16 Bauer also suggested that Goldhagen lacked familiarity with sources not in English or German, which thereby excluded research from Polish and Israeli sources writing in Hebrew, among others, all of whom had produced important research in the subject that would require a more subtle analysis. Bauer also argued that these linguistic limitations substantially impaired Goldhagen from undertaking broader comparative research into European antisemitism, which would have demanded further refinements to his analysis. Goldhagen replied to his critics in an article Motives, Causes, and Alibis: A Reply to My Critics: Ruth Bettina Birn and Volker Riess recognised the need to examine the primary sources (the Police Battalion investigation records) Goldhagen had cited and determine if Goldhagen had applied the historical method in his research. Their task was complicated by the way that \\"Goldhagen's book [had] neither a bibliography nor a listing of archival sources\\".Birn, Ruth Bettina & Riess, Volker. \\"Revising the Holocaust\\" (1997) p.197 Their conclusions were that Goldhagen's analysis of the records: =Accusations of racism= Several critics, including David North,. have characterized Goldhagen's text as adopting Nazi concepts of identity and utilizing them to slur Germans. Hilberg, to whom Browning dedicated his monograph, wrote that \\"Goldhagen has left us with the image of a medieval-like incubus, a demon latent in the German mind ... waiting for the opportunity for the chance to strike out\\".Guttenplan, D. D. (2002), The Holocaust on Trial (Google Books preview) New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2002, page 215. [words not found in book word search] The American columnist D. D. Guttenplan, author of The Holocaust on Trial also dedicated to Hilberg, wrote that the only difference between Goldhagen's claims of an eliminationist culture and those of Meir Kahane was that Goldhagen's targets were the Germans, whereas Kahane's targets were the Arabs. Guttenplan charged that Goldhagen's remarks about the deaths of 3 million Soviet POWs in German custody in World War II as \\"incidental\\" to the Holocaust were factually wrong, stating that the first people gassed at Auschwitz in August 1941 were Soviet POWs.Guttenplan, D.D The Holocaust on Trial, W. W. Norton & Company, 2001 pages 73-75 (Google Books preview). Influenced by the thesis about the Jews and Soviets as equal victims of the Holocaust presented in the American historian Arno J. Mayer's 1988 book Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? Guttenplan argued that the Nazi theories about \\"Judo-Bolshevism\\" made for a more complex explanation for the Holocaust than the Goldhagen thesis about an \\"elminationist anti-Semitic\\" culture. Goldhagen has said that there is no racist or ethnic argument about Germans in his text. Some of his critics have agreed with him that his thesis is \\"not intrinsically racist or otherwise illegitimate\\", including Ruth Bettina Birn and Norman Finkelstein (A Nation on Trial).. =Popular response= When the English edition of Hitler's Willing Executioners was published in March 1996, numerous German reviews ensued. In April 1996, before the book had appeared in German translation, Der Spiegel ran a cover story on Hitler's Willing Executioners under the title \\"Ein Volk von Dämonen?\\".Rosenbaum, Ron Explaining Hitler, New York: HarperCollins, 1998 page 346. The phrase ein Volk von Dämonen (translated \\"a people/nation of demons\\") was often used by the Nazis to describe Jews, and the title of the cover story was meant by Rudolf Augstein and the editors of Der Spiegel to suggest a moral equivalence between the Nazi view of Jews and Goldhagen's view of Germans. The most widely read German weekly newspaper Die Zeit published an eight-part series of opinions of the book before its German publication in August 1996. Goldhagen arrived in Germany in September 1996 for a book tour, and appeared on several television talk shows, as well as a number of sold-out panel discussions. \\"The reception in the country of Goldhagen's book ... whose German translation appeared in August 1996, was unparalleled\\". The book had a \\"mostly scathing\\" reception among historians,Shatz, Adam. (April 8, 1998) Goldhagen's willing executioners: the attack on a scholarly superstar, and how he fights back Slate. Retrieved January 4, 2008.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation London: Arnold 2000, pp. 254–56.\\"The Goldhagen Controversy: Agonising Problems, Scholarly Failure, and the Political Dimension,\\" in German History, vol. 15, 1997, pp. 80–91. who were vocal in condemning it as ahistorical. \\"[W]hy does this book, so lacking in factual content and logical rigour, demand so much attention?\\" Raul Hilberg wondered.. The pre-eminent Jewish-American historian Fritz Stern denounced the book as unscholarly and full of racist Germanophobia. Hilberg summarised the debates: \\"by the end of 1996, it was clear that in sharp distinction from lay readers, much of the academic world had wiped Goldhagen off the map.\\". Steve Crawshaw writes that although the German readership was keenly aware of certain \\"professional failings\\" in Goldhagen's book, Crawshaw further asserts that the book's critics were partly historians \\"weary\\" of Goldhagen's \\"methodological flaws\\", but also those who were reluctant to concede that ordinary Germans bore responsibility for the crimes of Nazi Germany. In Germany, the leftist general public's insistence on further penitence prevailed, according to most observers. American historian Gordon A. Craig and Der Spiegel have argued that whatever the book's flaws, it should be welcomed because it will reinvigorate the debate on the Holocaust and stimulate new scholarship. =Journalism= In May 1996, Goldhagen was interviewed about Hitler's Willing Executioners by the American journalist Ron Rosenbaum. When Rosebaum asked Goldhagen about scholarly literature that contends that Austrian anti-Semitism was far more virulent and violent than German anti- Semitism, and if the fact that Hitler was an Austrian had any effect on his thesis, Goldhagen replied: Rosenbaum inquired about Goldhagen's \\"pregnant with murder\\" metaphor, which suggested that the Shoah was something inevitable that would have happened without Hitler and Milton Himmelfarb's famous formulation \\"No Hitler, no Holocaust\\".Rosenbaum, Ron Explaining Hitler, New York: HarperCollins, 1998 page 349. Rosenbaum asked \\"So you would agree with Himmelfarb's argument?\\" Goldhagen replied: \\"If the Nazis had never taken power, there would not have been a Hitler. Had there not been a depression in Germany, then in all likelihood the Nazis wouldn't have come to power. The anti-Semitism would have remained a potential, in the sense of the killing form. It required a state.\\" Rosenbaum asked Goldhagen about Richard Levy's 1975 book The Downfall of the Anti-Semitic Political Parties in Imperial Germany which traced the decline of the völkisch parties in the early 20th century until they were all but wiped out in the 1912 Reichstag election. Goldhagen replied that voting for or against the wildly antisemitic völkisch parties had nothing to do with antisemitic feeling, and that people could still hate Jews without voting for the völkisch parties.Rosenbaum, Ron Explaining Hitler, New York: HarperCollins, 1998 pages 353-354. In 2006, Jewish American conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg argued that \\"Goldhagen's thesis was overstated but fundamentally accurate. There was something unique to Germany that made its fascism genocidal. Around the globe there have been dozens of self-declared fascist movements (and a good deal more that go by different labels), and few of them have embraced Nazi-style genocide. Indeed, fascist Spain was a haven for Jews during the Holocaust\\" he said. Goldberg went on to state that Goldhagen was mistaken in believing that \\"eliminationist antisemitism\\" was unique to Germany, and Goldberg charged \\"eliminationist antisemitism\\" was just as much a feature of modern Palestinian culture as it was of 19th-20th-century German culture, and that in all essentials Hamas today was just as genocidal as the NSDAP had been. In 2011, in an apparent reference to Hitler's Willing Executioners, the American columnist Jeffrey Goldberg wrote the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran were all \\"eliminationist anti-Semites\\". From a different angle, the American political scientist Norman Finkelstein charged that the book was Zionist propaganda meant to promote the image of a Gentile world forever committed to the destruction of the Jews, thus justifying the existence of Israel, and as such, Goldhagen's book was more concerned with the politics of the Near East and excusing what Finkelstein claimed was Israel's poor human rights record rather than European history. In turn during a review of A Nation On Trial, the American journalist Max Frankel wrote that Finkelstein's anti-Zionist politics had led him to \\"get so far afield from the Goldhagen thesis that it is a relief to reach the critique by Ruth Bettina Birn\\".

SH 118 is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The road lies entirely within the Trans- Pecos region of Texas. SH 118 is a two-lane road along its length except for a section in Alpine where the route follows the path of U.S. Route 67 and U.S. Route 90. All of the route except for the section between Big Bend National Park and Farm to Market Road 170 is included in the Texas Historical Commission's Texas Mountain Trail. The road passes through or along several state and federal parks and other wildlife preservation areas. These include Big Bend National Park and Fort Davis National Historic Site of the National Park Service, Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area and Davis Mountains State Park operated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Davis Mountains Preserve of the Nature Conservancy of Texas. The road is in the Chihuahuan Desert and passes mostly through scrub land except in the higher elevations of the Davis Mountains where the road encounters forested sky islands. The road also provides access to the University of Texas at Austin's McDonald Observatory. History left In 1927, the Texas Legislature authorized the Texas Highway Department, a precursor agency to TxDOT, to construct Davis Mountains State Park Highway after what was then the State Parks Board had failed to acquire parkland for a state park within the Davis Mountains. The road was to include portions of the present SH 118 and State Highway 166 now known as the Davis Mountains Scenic Loop. On August 17, 1926, SH 118 was designated from Marfa to Presidio. On March 19, 1929, the route was extended north to Fort Davis. On May 1, 1931, SH 118 was replaced by SH 17 and SH 118 was instead assigned on the old route of SH 3 from Alpine to Fort Davis which was completed. By 1932, the parks board finally acquired land for a park ending the need for a park highway. The road, which had then been built from Fort Davis to Fowlkes Ranch, was designated as SH 166. On December 22, 1936, SH 118 extended south to Terlingua. On September 26, 1939 when the state highway commission approved the General Redesignation of the State Highway System and created the state's Highway Designation Files, SH 118 had been extended north to Kent, replacing SH 233. With this new designation, the route was largely the same as the present with the exception of taking a more westerly path at a point near Adobe Walls Mountain in southern Brewster County in order to terminate at Terlingua rather than Study Butte; although, except for the stretch between Alpine and Fowlkes Ranch, the road was unpaved and even classified as primitive in places. The stretch of the road through Fort Davis to the present intersection with SH 166 at Nunn Hill was concurrent with SH 166. On October 30 of that same year, a spur route of former State Highway 227 was designated as an extension of SH 118 causing the road to terminate at SH 227. This extension followed the easternmost path of present-day FM 170 to its terminus, and then down the southernmost stretch of the present SH 118 and the westernmost portion of the current park road ending at the intersection of what is now the Old Maverick Road within the present Big Bend National Park. On May 29, 1941, the state canceled the designation of SH 118 from Alpine to SH 227 with the Terlingua Spur between Terlingua and SH 227 receiving the designation of State Spur 121 and the portion between Terlingua and Alpine reverting to county jurisdiction. On November 24 of that same year, SH 166 was given its present termini with its concurrent designation over SH 118 from Fort Davis to Nunn Hill dropped. The cancellation of the route south of Alpine was short lived. On January 8, 1946, SH 118 was extended south 10 miles from Alpine. On February 20, 1946, Spur 121 was cancelled. On September 9, 1947, SH 118 was extended south 10 more miles. On July 15, 1949, SH 118 was extended south 40 more miles. On July 25, 1951, SH 118 was extended south 10 miles. On December 18, 1951, SH 118 was extended south 11 miles to its current terminus. Route description SH 118 is within Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Culberson counties. =Brewster County= Texas State Highway 118 in Brewster County, approaching Terlingua and Big Bend National Park The section of SH 118 within Brewster County makes up a majority of the route's length at .Texas Department of Transportation, Statewide Planning Map using map's measurement utility The route begins where the roadway from Big Bend National Park's headquarters reaches the park's western entrance, and then proceeds a short distance to Study Butte. At Study Butte, SH 118 intersects FM 170 to Terlingua and Lajitas, and then proceeds along the Rio Grande to Presidio. Although the area around Study Butte is mountainous, the route through much of southern Brewster County is composed of long, straight stretches through arid ranch land as the road slowly climbs in elevation as its distance from the Rio Grande increases. Between Study Butte and Alpine, there are no major intersections, only junctions with unpaved county roads serving ranches and roads into remote residential subdivisions. Beyond a roadside picnic table near Crossen Mesa past the entrance to Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area, the road begins to enter the Davis Mountains. The road then becomes winding as it passes through the mountainous terrain. In this portion, there is another group of roadside picnic tables with a view of Cathedral Mountain. The road at one hill near Alpine has tight turns and steep grades as the road approaches the plateau where Alpine is situated. There is a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement checkpoint south of Alpine. The road enters Alpine as South Walker Street passing along the eastern edge of Alpine Hill. SH 118 then makes a left and right curve to move one block further west on South Cockrell Street to pass along the western side of Sul Ross State University's Jackson Field football stadium. The road then crosses the Union Pacific Railroad and intersects U.S. Route 67 and U.S. Route 90. US 67 and US 90 overlay each other, and their route through the central part of the city passes along two one-way two-lane streets one block from each other. SH joins this overlay, with its northbound route following west on East Avenue E toward Marfa and its southbound route one block south on East Holland Avenue toward Marathon and Fort Stockton. SH 118 leaves the overlay going northward at North Fifth Street. On the city's north side, SH 118 leaves the street grid and intersects State Highway 223, a short highway passing around Alpine's northeastern quadrant to US 67 and US 90 at Sul Ross State University. SH 118 then crosses the South Orient Rail Line and passes by Alpine Casparis Municipal Airport before leaving town following a straight stretch to the county line. =Jeff Davis County= View of Davis Mountains from SH 118 at Mt. Locke with downhill section of SH 118 at left SH 118 passes through Jeff Davis County for . As the road enters the county, the road intersects Ranch to Market Road 1837 to the Girl Scouts of the USA's Camp Mitre Peak, then SH 118 enters Musquiz Canyon where the road again becomes winding with occasional steep grades and sharp curves. There is another collection of roadside picnic tables near the ruins of the Musquiz pioneer homestead on the highway's right of way within the canyon. After this, the road emerges from the canyon near the Chihuahuan Desert Research Institute and passes along a plateau toward Fort Davis. The road enters Fort Davis as Musquiz Drive and intersects State Highway 17 at South State Street. SH 118 then follows SH 17 through town along State St. passing by the entrance to Fort Davis National Historic Site at Lt. Flipper Drive. The road then passes along the eastern park boundary until SH 118 separates from SH 17 on the north edge of town. SH 118 then follows Canyon Drive out of town along the north boundary of the national historic site into Limpia Canyon. The road then enters Davis Mountains State Park where it intersects State Park Road 3. The road then proceeds toward Mount Locke and McDonald Observatory with many roadside picnic tables between Fort Davis and the observatory. The route toward the observatory has numerous steep grades and tight curves. At Mt. Locke, SH 118 intersects State Highway Spur 78 which proceeds the rest of the way toward McDonald Observatory. Beyond the observatory at Eppenauer Ranch, the road becomes much more rugged with narrower lanes and only grass shoulders. The road continues through steep grades and curves requiring slow speeds through the forested higher elevations of the Davis Mountains. Along this stretch to the intersection at SH 166, the roadway is often not fenced and cattle guards cross the road. Loose livestock pose a hazard to motorist in this portion of the road. In this section of the road is the Lawrence E. Woods Park in Madera Canyon, a roadside drive with five picnic tables amidst a grove of Ponderosa Pines that is also the trail head of a Davis Mountains Preserve hiking trail. After the intersection with SH 166 toward Valentine, SH 118 alternates between straight and mountainous stretches for the remainder of the distance in the county. =Culberson County= The Culberson County portion of SH 118 is the shortest at . The road continues north through ranch land with no intersections with public roads until it terminates at Kent at the edge of the northern foothills of the Davis Mountains. At its terminus, the road overpasses Interstate 10. Beyond the terminus at I-10, the roadway itself continues northward as Ranch to Market Road 2424. Speed Limit on TX 118 is 55 in Culberson County and 70 in Jeff Davis County.

History The chalice designed by William Butterfield and made for use at the House of Mercy convent, Clewer The Community was founded in England in 1852 by Harriet Monsell (the first Superior), a clergy widow, and Thomas Thellusson Carter, a priest at St Andrew's Church, Clewer, Windsor. The purpose of the order was to help marginalised women – mainly single mothers, the homeless and sex trade workers – by providing them shelter and teaching them a trade. The work of the sisters expanded to include administering and working in orphanages, schools, convalescent hospitals, soup kitchens, and women's hostels.Anglican Religious Communities Yearbook: 2004–2005. Norwich: Canterbury Press, 2003. The Community is conspicuous amongst Anglican communities for its meteoric rise in numbers from the date of the foundation. By the time of Carter's death in 1901 there were some 300 Sisters. At its height, the Community had some 45 priories and branch houses. CSJB in the United Kingdom Bishop Edward King Chapel at Ripon College Cuddesdon The community's headquarters were, historically, at their purpose-built Victorian convent in Hatch Lane, Clewer, Windsor. This very large and imposing structure, by Henry Woodyer, is a local landmark, and includes a highly decorated chapel, and extensive accommodation for sisters, guests, and the female destitute persons to whom the community traditionally gave shelter.See this article about the site. Following a sharp decrease in membership, the community found itself using only a tiny part of the buildings, and in 2001 relocated to Oxfordshire. The original convent has since been converted into flats. William Henry Hutchings was Warden from 1865 to 1884 when he became rector of Pickering, Yorkshire.Dr. W. H. Hutchings. The Times (London, England), Monday, Jan. 08, 1912; pg. 11; Issue 39789 He was succeeded by Thomas Thellusson Carter.Staley, V. (1908) The Catholic Religion. Oxford: A. R. Mowbray & Co.; p. vii (preface written in 1893) The Sisters lived at Begbroke, near Kidlington in Oxfordshire for several years, then moved to their newly constructed Convent, Harriet Monsell House, which is on the campus of the Ripon College Cuddesdon a Church of England Theological College, in 2013. They also endowed a new chapel, Bishop Edward King Chapel, for the college which will be part of the Community's lasting legacy to the Church after it has completed its work. The Chapel has won several architectural awards since its completion. The Church of England's Clewer Initiative combating modern slavery is funded by the Community, and continues the Sisters' tradition of protecting the vulnerable and marginalized. Since 1996 the remaining sisters of another Order, the Community of the Companions of Jesus the Good Shepherd have been living with the CSJB sisters, and although the two Orders remain quite distinct, they share accommodation and many other aspects of community life. CSJB in the United States Building in Mendham, New Jersey The Community expanded to the United States in 1874, following the donation of property by the family of the first American CSJB sister. Work was needed among German immigrants in New York's Lower East Side, and the community moved there. The American Mother House was eventually established at Mendham, New Jersey. Work in New York was ended in 1976. In 2007, however, the Sisters returned to Manhattan, opening a branch house at the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin on Times Square, but in 2018 were recalled to the mother house. The main convent at 82 West Main Street, Mendham, New Jersey, includes a retreat house for guests and also the community's historic church, all set in over 20 acres of land. The convent building was constructed as the Mother House of the American community in 1913. The sisters then closed down the Mother House at 233 E. 17th St. in Manhattan and moved permanently to Mendham in 1915. The Convent building was added to the American National Register of Historic Places (reference number 07000356) in 2007. The architects of the main convent were Durr Friedley and William W. Cordingly. St Marguerite's Retreat House in Mendham, Built in 1908 in the 'Tudor Revival' style, was a home and school for girls until after World War II, and is now a working retreat house for all denominations. Its architects were James Layng Mills and John C. Greenleaf. CSJB in India The Community no longer operates in the Indian sub-continent. Historically, however, there were CSJB houses and missions in India. Their story has been recorded by Valerie Bonham in a book entitled Sisters of the Raj: the Clewer Sisters in India.Book detailed here. Character Apart from ministries of social aid and assistance, members of the order live a life of prayer, and operate retreat facilities as well as providing retreats and spiritual direction. In these endeavours, they are guided by the Augustinian Rule's emphasis on community spirit.

This technique in first came into wide use in the late 1980s in the United States. Samuel Jackson, Lummus, Consolidated, and other industry pioneers were early adopters of the technique. Prior to the introduction of pull-through systems, the cotton conveying systems in gins required fan(s) at both the beginning of the line pushing the cotton and at the end of the line pulling the cotton through. These systems are known as \\"push pull systems\\". Early experimentation with pull-through systems began by removing sources of high-pressure drop, such as tower dryers. This not only allowed for much higher air volumes, but it eliminated the need for the push fans, making use of more efficient and more powerful fans on the pull side only. Pull-through layouts quickly increased in popularity because of the several performance advantages it offers. These advantages include that it permits enhanced machinery arrangements at the front end of the cotton ginning process, permits larger drying air volumes with greater horsepower efficiency, allows more forgiving division of cotton flow streams, and offers better cotton gin housekeeping due to natural evacuation of airborne dirt and lint from the building from the suction fans. Today, a large majority of saw-type cotton gins worldwide use pull-through techniques in at least a portion, if not all of their pneumatic conveying and drying processes. Note that the term \\"pull through\\" is specific to the cotton ginning industry. Other industries may refer to the same thing as \\"negative pressure very dilute phase pneumatic conveyance\\". Musicians memorializing the cotton ginning industry have shown a universal preference toward \\"pull through\\" over \\"negative pressure very dilute phase pneumatic conveyance\\", although there is universal engineering agreement that the latter term is both more articulate and accurate.

Biography His career began in the mid 1990s as part of 1st Down, which consisted of Phat Kat on vocals and Jay Dee on production. The group was short lived however, possibly because of insufficient support/promotion from their label, Payday, but the two continued to collaborate on many occasions afterwards, starting with an appearance on \\"Fat Cat Song\\" and its remix, from Slum Village's Fan-Tas-Tic (Vol. 1). In an interview, he spoke in regards to his time and music creations alongside Dilla, as well as the producer's work ethic: His first full-length album, The Undeniable LP was released on June 22, 2004, on Barak Records. It featured appearances from Slum Village, Dwele, Big Tone of 87 Wasted Youth, and Obie Trice. Kat released a 12-inch single in late 2006 for the song Cold Steel produced by J Dilla, he then followed it with his latest LP, Carte Blanche, on April 24 on Look Records. The album has proved to be Kat's most universally acknowledged effort yet. During a radio interview with T3 in WJLB, Phat Kat rung in and spoke against T3. He stated that T3 had dismantled the group, after the Reunion Pt 2 video was released and Elzhi wasn't in the video. T3 had said that he and Elzhi were still on good speaking terms, however Phat Kat contradicted him saying that \\"Elzhi ain't f*ing witchu, don't do that to the fans, keep it real\\". T3 didn't know what the future of Slum Village was as Elzhi hadn't released a statement regarding his intentions of whether to continue Slum Village and Phat Kat strongly disagreed.

It was established by the Idaho Legislature in 1893, as one of two normal schools in the state. (The other, in Lewiston, is now Lewis–Clark State College.) Citizens of Albion had actively lobbied for the school's establishment, and donated land and labor for the new campus.  History  The school remained a small institution throughout its history, focusing on the training of teachers and drawing its student body primarily from south- central Idaho. Albion Normal offered a two-year teacher training program until 1947, when it was renamed Southern Idaho College of Education (SICE) and authorized to confer baccalaureate degrees. In 1921, the Idaho Legislature approved the closing of Albion and its relocation to nearby Burley. The school remained troubled by low enrollment and a lack of funding, however, and was finally closed by the state in 1951, as was its counterpart in northern Idaho, Lewiston's NICE. The academic programs at Albion were transferred to Idaho State College (now ISU) in Pocatello. Lewiston reopened in 1955 as Lewis–Clark Normal School and became LCSC in 1971. The campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 1980. Its elevation is above sea level. Swanger Hall on campus was built in 1893 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places The Albion State Normal School campus was featured on a season 15 episode of Ghost Adventures.

Created by Superman comic writer Elliot S. Maggin, Wells first appeared in Maggin's novel Superman: Miracle Monday (1981); he later introduced her into comics continuity as Superwoman.DC Comics Presents Annual #2 (1983) Fictional character biography Wells is a descendant of Jimmy Olsen who lives in the 29th century (like Jimmy, Wells is a freckled redhead). She is a journalism student whose graduate thesis was the successful investigation of the origins of the holiday known as Miracle Monday, using a form of time travel technology that had just begun to be used by the public in her era. She then became a teacher, but became interested in finding out the identity of Superwoman, the last superhero from the 20th century whose secret identity had never been discovered. She managed to convince the authorities of her time to send her to the past, at the moment when Superwoman was supposed to debut, helping Superman fight a villain called King Kosmos. Wells soon deduced that she herself was supposed to become Superwoman, and, using some of the technology she had brought from the future which allowed her to have superpowers (including flight, teleportation, empathy, precognition, and telekinesis), she disguised herself and helped Superman defeat Kosmos. She revealed the truth to Superman, then returned to the future to make the information public. Wells realized she would have to periodically return to the 20th century to ensure that all the historical events Superwoman was part of were fulfilled. However, during one of those trips, a malfunction of the time travel process—which was still imperfect—left Wells trapped in the past, suffering amnesia. This caused her boyfriend to lead a movement against time travel that eventually resulted in the firing of the director as well asstricter guidelines and more severe penalties for their violation. Years later, Wells returned home, apparently having recovered her memories, and was reunited with him. The details of her later activities in the present (and of her return to the future) remained unrevealed. The 29th-century Kristin's last appearances to date are in the non-canonical story Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? in 1986, and a brief cameo as a one panel ghost in The Kingdom: Planet Krypton in 1999. = Third Kryptonian = The Post-Crisis Kristin Wells, Karsta War-Ul. In Superman: The Third Kryptonian, it is revealed that a third Kryptonian (that is, after Clark and Kara) is on Earth. It is explained that the third Kryptonian does not refer to Chris Kent (Superman's foster son, General Zod's biological child), Power Girl (an Earth- Two Kryptonian) or Krypto (a canine Kryptonian). The storyline introduces a new Kristin Wells, an older woman and Kryptonian survivor named Karsta Wor-Ul who had left the planet many years before its destruction.Superman #669  Powers and abilities  In Pre-Crisis, Wells has no inherent superpowers. For the most part Superwoman's powers were based on 29th century technology. Using a gravity redistribution flightbelt she was able to fly and an opal beam amulet gave her the power of decorporealization, which among other things enabled her to pass through solid objects. The opal amulet also gave her the power of teleportation. Amulet mass reduction gave her superhuman strength. Combined with a time-warp belt the amulet could create a five-dimensional \\"hole poker\\" that could create time/space warps. Space-pocket retention gave her invulnerability and time-field projection gave her limited intuition abilities.

It was devised as a series of terrorist attacks intended to create an image of Croatia as a pro-fascist state. Two bombings were carried out on 19 August 1991, with one at the Jewish Community Centre and a second near Jewish graves at the Mirogoj Cemetery; there were no casualties. Additional attacks targeted the national railway network and were designed to implicate the Croatian President. Operation Labrador was complemented by Operation Opera — a propaganda campaign devised by the KOS to feed disinformation to the media. Further activities of Operation Labrador were abandoned in September, after Croatian authorities captured the Yugoslav Air Force regional headquarters in Zagreb, and confiscated documents related to the operation. The authorities took nearly a month to analyze the captured documents, allowing time for the principal agents involved in the bombings to flee. Fifteen others were arrested in connection with the attack, but they were subsequently released in a prisoner exchange. Five KOS agents involved in Operation Labrador were tried in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on terrorism charges and acquitted. Croatian authorities captured two KOS agents who were part of the operation and tried them along with seven other agents who were tried in absentia. Those in custody were acquitted, while those tried in absentia were convicted. The existence of Operation Labrador was further confirmed through the testimony of a former KOS agent, Major Mustafa Čandić, during the trial of Slobodan Milošević at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 2002. Background In August 1990, an insurrection took place in Croatia centering in the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin, the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and eastern Croatia. The areas were subsequently named SAO Krajina (Serb Autonomous Oblast) and, after local leaders announced their intention to integrate SAO Krajina with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the SAO Krajina secession movement a rebellion. By March 1991, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium followed, after which the declaration came into effect on 8 October 1991. The SAO Krajina, renamed Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 19 December 1991, responded with a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Croatian civilians. With the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) lending support to SAO Krajina leadership and the Croatian Police unable to cope with the situation, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. The development of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September, while the military conflict in Croatia continued to escalate. The JNA maintained substantial forces in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, throughout 1991. Bombings Palmotićeva Street in Zagreb In August 1991, the Yugoslav Air Force's Counterintelligence Service (KOS) executed a series of activities, codenamed Operation Labrador, aimed at discrediting the new Croatian government. Operation Labrador was planned to include several terrorist attacks that would go hand-in-hand with the activities of Operation Opera — a propaganda campaign devised to feed disinformation to the media. The two operations were intended to portray Croatia as a pro-fascist state. An alternative name for Operation Opera was Operation Opera-Orijentalis, or Operation Opera Orientalis. Operation Labrador was headed by Colonel General Slobodan Rakočević, head of the Yugoslav Air Force branch of the KOS, based in Zemun. In Zagreb, operational control of Labrador was assigned to Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Sabolović, and Major Čedo Knežević. Lieutenant Colonel Radenko Radojčić was tasked with the storage of a substantial quantity of explosives in Zagreb and its surrounding areas and the subsequent planting of explosive devices in designated locations. The explosives and other munitions were stored across several sites. On 19 August, the Jewish Community Centre in Palmotićeva Street in Zagreb, and Jewish graves at the Mirogoj Cemetery, were bombed as a part of Operation Labrador. The explosions caused property damage, but resulted in no casualties. There were no public claims of responsibility for the attack. Aside from the two explosions in Zagreb, agents assigned to Operation Labrador were thought to also be responsible for bombing the Zagreb–Belgrade railway near Vinkovci and a railway line between Glina and Vojnić. The railway attacks have also been ascribed to Operation Opera. Aftermath In the immediate aftermath of the bombings in Zagreb, Josip Manolić, who had just been appointed head of the Croatian intelligence service, claimed Croatian right- wing extremists were responsible. Operation Labrador was abandoned after the ZNG and the Croatian police captured the Yugoslav Air Force headquarters in Zagreb on 15 September 1991, during the Battle of the Barracks. The materials captured inside the facility included codes and computer disks related to Operation Labrador, as well as Sabolović's notes. Sabolović turned the materials over to his immediate superior at headquarters, Mirko Martić, but Martić failed to destroy them. In response, Sabolović fled Zagreb. Croatian police took almost a month to analyze the captured materials properly and uncover Operation Labrador. Sabolović later claimed that only a part of the Operation Labrador network was dismantled, but he was contradicted by KOS Major Mustafa Čandić who was posted at the Zemun headquarters of KOS. In autumn of 1991, Croatian intelligence services launched Operation Janissary (Operacija Janjičar) aimed at dismantling the remaining KOS network in Croatia. The operation was a joint operation of all Croatian intelligence services. It was authorized by Ivan Vekić and Gojko Šušak, then interior and defence ministers, and initially headed by Josip Perković. Fifteen suspects were arrested by the end of 1991; they were subsequently exchanged for Anton Kikaš, who was captured by the JNA while smuggling a plane-load of weapons to Croatia. The operation also produced a list of suspected KOS operatives in Croatia containing 1,789 names and pseudonyms. Rakočević, Sabolović, Radojčić and two other former KOS agents were tried in Belgrade in 1993. The five were charged with instigation of terrorism and other crimes, but all were acquitted. Radojčić was arrested again in Zagreb in late 1993. The second Trial of Radojčić and eight other suspects charged in connection with Operations Labrador and Opera, held in Zagreb, ended with the acquittal of Radojčić and Ratomir Mažibrada, who were in custody, and the convictions of the other defendants who were all tried in absentia. Testifying at the Trial of Slobodan Milošević at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 2002, Čandić stated that all Operation Labrador agents left Zagreb and took the remaining documents with them. He also said that the KOS had an extensive network of informants within Croatian intelligence services and the ruling Croatian Democratic Union in 1991. Čandić also testified that the railway bombing near Vinkovci was intended to implicate Croatian President Franjo Tuđman. Bomb damage to the Jewish Community Centre was repaired between February and September 1992, using government funds.

Tlalnepantla comes from the Náhuatl words tlalli (land) and nepantla (middle) to mean the middle land. The city was known in prior times as Tlalnepantla de Galeana and Tlalnepantla de Comonfort, to honor Hermenegildo Galeana and Ignacio Comonfort, respectively. The current addition of Baz comes from the last name of Gustavo Baz Prada, an important politician and soldier of Emiliano Zapata's army during the Mexican Revolution. After the Revolution, Baz Prada became Governor of the State of Mexico and President of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). It is located in the northeastern part of the state of Mexico, in the Valley of Mexico north of Mexico City proper. Together with Atizapán, it comprises the dense Region XII of Mexico State. History Tlalnepantla's municipal building Around the 11th century, a people called the Amaquemecan (after whom the municipality of Amecameca is named), migrated to this area following their leader Xolotl to look for a better climate and more food to sustain themselves. This same Xolotl founded the Tenayuca Oztopolco chiefdom and made the first census ever in the Americas. The Acolhuas, Tepanecas and Otomis were already established in this land so alliances were made. Despite this, the region was eventually conquered and made a tributary of the Aztec Empire. After the Spanish Conquest, the area was evangelized by the Franciscans. The founding of modern Tlalnepantla was the result of a dispute between the towns of Tenayuca and Teocalhueyacan as to which should be the site of Franciscan monastery and religious center for the area. The result was to place the monastery at the midpoint between these two towns, and hence the name (middle land). This monastery, named Corpus Christi was built in 1550. After independence, Tlalnepantla was originally part of Mexico City, but in 1825, it was recognized as a district of the State of Mexico. The municipality is divided almost entirely by Mexico City's Gustavo A. Madero delegation. During the Presidency of Porfirio Díaz, Tlalnepantla began industrial development, and in the 1950s underwent a demographic explosion after being declared a city in 1948. The population as of the 2010 INEGI census was 653,410 people, representing 98.37% of municipal population.2010 census tables: INEGI Infrastructure Plaza Wichita with replica of The Keeper of the Plains statue donated by Tlalnepantla's sister city Wichita, Kansas, United States. Tlalnepantla is a large city with an important mall (Mundo E) and hotels: Crowne Plaza Lancaster, Camino Real, Fiesta Inn, NH hotel, Holiday Inn, and Four Points by Sheraton. Tlalnepantla offers different options for entertainment and food: Punta Recoleta Restaurante (Argentine food), Boca del Rio (Mexican food restaurant), Real de Catorce (Show and Mexican food restaurant), La Antigua (Mexican food restaurant). The most important avenues and boulevards in Tlalnepantla City are: * Gustavo Baz Ave. * Mario Colin Ave. * Adolfo Lopez Mateos Blvd. * Presidente Juárez Ave. As well as the Periférico and the Mexico-Querétaro Freeway with 15 lanes in Tlalnepantla. (This is a section of Mexican Federal Highway 57, part of the Pan-American Highway.) Tlanepantla is well served by the local pesero, intercity bus network and the suburban train.  Education  Schools located in the city include: * UNAM, Facultad de Estudios Superiores Iztacala (FES Iztacala) * National Autonomous University of Mexico * Instituto Tecnológico de Tlalnepantla (ITTLA) * Tlalnepantlas Institute of Technology * Centro Universitario Emilio Cardenas (CUDEC) * Escuela Bancaria y Comercial (EBC Tlalnepantla) * Universidad Latinoamericana (ULA) * Sistema Educativo Indoamericano (INDO) * Centro Eleia * Universidad Interamericana para el Desarrollo (UNID) * Universidad de Cuautitlan Izcalli (UCI) * Ateneo de Tlalnepantla * Universidad ETAC (Escuela Técnica en Administración y Comercio) Private schools: * Instituto Thomas Jefferson Economy There are more than 2,700 industries located here, making Tlalnepantla one of the most industrialized areas in the country, along with Naucalpan and Monterrey, ranking first in the state of Mexico. The most common industries include: food processing, bottling, tobacco products, textiles, paper products, non-metallic mineral products and metals, chemicals and petroleum products, machinery and wood products. Its industrial zone is one of the largest in the country. The area also includes more than 15,000 retail businesses, including the Mundo E Mall and several large tianguis. Notable sites Tenayuca pyramid The church and monastery of Corpus Christi was built by both Nahuas and Otomis of pink and gray stone. The side gate, called the Porciúncula, shows the influence of both these peoples. In 1963, the church gained cathedral status. The aqueduct that extends from Tlalnepantla to Villa de Guadalupe as well as the Caja del Agua are works that date from the colonial period. The Hacienda of Santa Mónica and the Hacienda de Emmedio are well-preserved. The Centro Cultural Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz has a collection of 130 fotografías del Tlalnepantla from the end of the 19th century to 1960 as well as other historical objects. Pyramid at Santa Cecilia Acatitlán Two notable pyramids lie in the municipality's limits: Tenayuca and Santa Cecilia Acatitlan. The pyramid at Tenayuca is a smaller version of the Templo Mayor the Aztecs built in Tenochtitlan. It has dual staircases on the west side, each leading to two temples, at the top of the pyramid. One was dedicated to Tlaloc and the other to Huizilopochtli. Serpent sculptures surround the pyramid on three sides and are possibly of pre-Aztec origin. A small museum on the grounds holds artifacts diagrams and models of the site and the history that surrounds it. Another, smaller pyramid is at Santa Cecilia Acatitlan, just north of Tenayuca. This one was rebuilt as the original was destroyed and some of its blocks were used to build the Santa Cecelia Parish church that is next to it. This pyramid has one staircase one temple atop. On the plaza is the Hurtado Museum, which houses a small collection of pre Hispanic sculpture.

In its original form, it relates the masses of the three charged leptons; later authors have extended the relation to neutrinos, quarks, and other families of particles.Zenczykowski, P., Elementary Particles And Emergent Phase Space (Singapore: World Scientific, 2014), pp. 64–66. Formula The Koide formula is :Q = \\\\frac{m_e + m_\\\\mu + m_\\\\tau}{\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{m_e\\\\,} + \\\\sqrt{m_\\\\mu\\\\,} + \\\\sqrt{m_\\\\tau\\\\,}\\\\right)^2} = 0.666661(7) \\\\approx \\\\frac{2}{3}, where the masses of the electron, muon, and tau are measured respectively as = , = , and = ; the digits in parentheses are the uncertainties in the last figures. This gives = .Since the uncertainties in and are much smaller than e that in , the uncertainty in was calculated as \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial m_\\\\tau}\\\\Delta m_\\\\tau. No matter what masses are chosen to stand in place of the electron, muon, and tau, The upper bound follows from the fact that the square roots are necessarily positive, and the lower bound follows from the Cauchy–Bunyakovsky–Schwarz inequality. The experimentally determined value, , lies at the center of the mathematically allowed range. The mystery is in the physical value. Not only is the result peculiar, in that three ostensibly arbitrary numbers give a simple fraction, but also in that in the case of electron, muon, and tau, is exactly halfway between the two extremes of all possible combinations: (if the three masses were equal) and 1 (if one mass dominates). The Koide formula can also be interpreted as geometrical relation, in which the value \\\\frac{1}{3Q} is the squared cosine of the angle between the vector [\\\\,\\\\sqrt{m_e\\\\,}, \\\\sqrt{m_\\\\mu\\\\,}, \\\\sqrt{m_\\\\tau\\\\,}\\\\,] and the vector [1, 1, 1] (see dot product). That angle is almost exactly 45 degrees: \\\\theta = 45.000 \\\\pm 0.001. When the formula is assumed to hold exactly ( = ) it may be used to predict the tau mass from the (more precisely known) electron and muon masses; that prediciton is = . While the original formula arose in the context of preon models, other ways have been found to derive it (both by Sumino and by Koide – see references below). As a whole, however, understanding remains incomplete. Similar matches have been found for triplets of quarks depending on running masses. With alternating quarks, chaining Koide equations for consecutive triplets, it is possible to reach a result of 173.263947(6) GeV for the mass of the top quark.  Speculative extension  It has been proposed that the lepton masses are given by the squares of the eigenvalues of a circulant matrix with real eigenvalues, corresponding to the relation \\\\sqrt{m_n} = \\\\mu (1 + 2 \\\\eta \\\\cos(\\\\delta + n \\\\cdot 2\\\\pi/3)) which can be fit to experimental data with η2 = 0.500003(23) (corresponding to the Koide relation), and phase δ = 0.2222220(19), which is almost exactly 2/9. However, the experimental data are in conflict with simultaneous equality of η2 = 1/2 and δ = 2/9. This kind of relation has also been proposed for the quark families, with phases equal to 2/27 and 4/27, hinting at a relation with the charge of the particle family (1/3 and 2/3 for quarks vs. 1 for the leptons). Similar formulae There are similar empirical formulae which relate other masses. Quark masses depend on the energy scale used to measure them, which makes an analysis more complicated.Quadt, A., Top Quark Physics at Hadron Colliders (Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer, 2006), p. 147. Taking the heaviest three quarks, charm (1.275 ± 0.03 GeV), bottom (4.180 ± 0.04 GeV) and top (173.0 ± 0.40 GeV), and without using their uncertainties gives the value cited by F. G. Cao (2012), : Q_\\\\text{heavy} = \\\\frac{m_c + m_b + m_t}{\\\\big(\\\\sqrt{m_c} + \\\\sqrt{m_b} + \\\\sqrt{m_t}\\\\big)^2} \\\\approx 0.669 \\\\approx \\\\frac{2}{3} This was noticed by Rodejohann and Zhang in the first version of their 2011 article but the observation was removed in the published version, so the first published mention is in 2012 from Cao. Similarly, the masses of the lightest quarks, up (2.2 ± 0.4 MeV), down (4.7 ± 0.3 MeV), and strange (95.0 ± 4.0 MeV), without using their experimental uncertainties yield, : Q_\\\\text{light} = \\\\frac{m_u + m_d + m_s}{\\\\big(\\\\sqrt{m_u} + \\\\sqrt{m_d} + \\\\sqrt{m_s}\\\\big)^2} \\\\approx 0.56 \\\\approx \\\\frac{5}{9} a value also cited by Cao in the same paper. Running of particle masses In quantum field theory, quantities like coupling constant and mass \\"run\\" with the energy scale. That is, their value depends on the energy scale at which the observation occurs, in a way described by a renormalization group equation (RGE).Green, D., Cosmology with MATLAB (Singapore: World Scientific, 2016), p. 197. One usually expects relationships between such quantities to be simple at high energies (where some symmetry is unbroken) but not at low energies, where the RG flow will have produced complicated deviations from the high-energy relation. The Koide relation is exact (within experimental error) for the pole masses, which are low-energy quantities defined at different energy scales. For this reason, many physicists regard the relation as \\"numerology\\". However, the Japanese physicist Yukinari Sumino has proposed mechanisms to explain origins of the charged lepton spectrum as well as the Koide formula, e.g., by constructing an effective field theory in which a new gauge symmetry causes the pole masses to exactly satisfy the relation. Koide has published his opinions concerning Sumino's model. François Goffinet's doctoral thesis gives a discussion on pole masses and how the Koide formula can be reformulated without taking the square roots of masses.

Retrieved May 15, 2011, from https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024558/http://rancho.org/Research_RanchoLevels.aspx It is named after the Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, located in Downey, California, United States in Los Angeles County. After being assessed based on the LOCF, individuals with brain injury receive a score from one to eight. A score of one represents non-responsive cognitive functioning, whereas a score of eight represents purposeful and appropriate functioning.Fulk, G. D. (2007). Traumatic Brain Injury. In S. B. O’Sullivan & T. J. Schmitz (Eds.), Physical Rehabilitation (5th ed., pp. 895-935). Philadelphia, PA: F. A. Davis Company. Each of the eight levels represents the typical sequential progression of recovery from brain damage. However, individuals progress at different rates and may plateau at any stage of recovery. These patients are scored based on combinations of the following criteria: * responsiveness to stimuli * ability to follow commands * presence of non-purposeful behavior * cooperation * confusion * attention to environment * focus * coherence of verbalization * appropriateness of verbalizations and actions * memory recall * orientation * judgement and reasoning LOCF scores are used by health care professionals for standardized communication about patient status and can be used by physiatrists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, and speech language pathologists as the basis for treatment planning. This eight-level scale was found to possess test-retest and interrater reliability as well as concurrent and predictive validity.Gouvier, W. D., Blanton, P. D., LaPorte, K. K., & Nepomuceno, C.

M. Gordon John McRobbie Gordon, né John McRobbie (12 October 1857 - 22 February 1944) was a Scottish singer, actor, stage manager and director, known as an influential stage director of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company after the death of W. S. Gilbert. In his early career Gordon appeared in the chorus and minor roles in D'Oyly Carte productions, and after a period as a freelance actor, manager and director, he returned to the company permanently in 1910, as stage manager, and later stage director, establishing a reputation as a firm disciplinarian and upholder of the performing practices originated by Gilbert. Life and career =Early years= Gordon was born in Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire, the eldest son of Samuel McRobbie, a carpenter and farmer.Gordon, p. 1 Gordon retained his Aberdeen accent throughout his life.\\"Obituary\\", The Glasgow Herald, 25 February 1944 The family was musical and did not discourage the boy's ambitions for a career as a singer. He studied at the short-lived Aberdeen Conservatoire before moving to London in 1880.Gordon, pp. 10 and 13 He took his mother's maiden name as a stage name to avoid embarrassing his more puritanical relatives, who disapproved of the theatre.Gordon, Introduction and p. 13 He joined a touring opera company, playing baritone roles in such works as La Sonnambula and Fra Diavolo. In 1881 he was understudy to the baritone lead in the West End production of Audran's La Mascotte. Further small roles in touring opera companies followed. In 1883, while playing Marvejol in Audran's Olivette,\\"Olivette at West Hartlepool\\", The North-Eastern Daily Gazette, 4 January 1904, p. 3 he married a fellow member of the company, May Piemonté.Gordon, pp. 21 and 27 In 1883 Gordon joined one of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company touring companies as a member of the chorus in Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience. In 1884, he played the part of Colonel Calverley in Patience on tour.Gordon, p. 33 Richard D'Oyly Carte saw him perform and offered him the chance to join the main London company at the Savoy Theatre, as a chorus member and understudy.Gordon, p. 36 Gordon remained a member of the company until 1890, playing Piscator in The Carp, a one-act curtain raiser, when it accompanied Ruddigore (1887), and Harrington Jarramie in Mrs. Jarramie's Genie (another curtain raiser), when it accompanied The Yeomen of the Guard (1888).Stone, David. J.M. Gordon, Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 17 July 2014, accessed 21 April 2015 He was in the chorus in the original runs of Princess Ida (1884), The Mikado (1885), Ruddigore, The Yeomen of the Guard and The Gondoliers (1889), and the 1885 revival of Trial by Jury and The Sorcerer at the Savoy. In the 1890s, Gordon managed, and acted in, his own touring company, \\"The Gordon 'At Home' Party\\". It comprised variously four or five performers, playing a series of short pieces including Mock Turtles.The Era, 14 August 1897, p. 12; and \\"Local Topics\\", Shoreditch Observer, 11 December 1897, p. 3 He also ran his own band. By the early 1900s, he was working as a freelance conductor and stage director for British amateur operatic societies. Among the works he directed were Sullivan's The Emerald Isle, Planquette's Les cloches de Corneville, Cellier's Dorothy and The Mountebanks, and Gilbert's play Sweethearts.Gordon, pp. 59, 60 and 62 =D'Oyly Carte stage manager and director= Throughout his freelance period Gordon maintained his links with D'Oyly Carte, coaching young singers for the touring companies and the Savoy in his spare time. After Carte's death in 1901, Gordon continued to coach singers for Helen Carte after she took over the opera company. In March 1907 he served as stage manager to the D'Oyly Carte touring company.Rollins and Witts, p. 123 At the Savoy in July of that year, during the D'Oyly Carte's first London repertory season, he directed the revival of Iolanthe.Rollins and Witts, p. 21; and Bullough, John Malcolm. \\"Deeside Man Carries On Gilbert Traditions\\", Aberdeen Press and Journal, 13 December 1937, p. 6 In 1910 Gordon accepted Helen Carte's offer of a permanent position as stage manager to the company, and he gave up his freelance activities.Gordon, p. 71 Gilbert died in 1911, and Helen Carte died two years later. The opera company was inherited by her stepson, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, who, according to a 2014 biographical sketch of Gordon, needed a stage manager who would maintain the company's production standards and preserve Gilbert's traditions and style. Gordon's skills, attention to detail and tenacity, together with his experience with the company under Gilbert's direction, were what Carte required. One of Carte's priorities was to arrive at an authorised text. Over the years Gilbert had tweaked his libretti, removing out-of-date references and adding new ones. He had also permitted a few interpolations by senior members of the company. Gordon, whose close contacts with Gilbert had included work on the prompt books for the Savoy operas, was entrusted with preparing an authoritative set of libretti. In general, he retained the few \\"gags\\" that Gilbert had approved, and otherwise returned to the original 1870s and '80s texts. Gordon stage managed and then directed D'Oyly Carte productions for the next twenty-eight years. He coached new artists on the blocking, dances, and line readings for each part, and maintained strict quality control over the productions. He was named stage director for the company in 1922 and served in that capacity for seventeen years.Rollins and Witts, Appendix pp. I–IV When The Sorcerer was revived in 1916 after a long absence from the company's repertory, Gordon directed the production.Bullough, John Malcolm. \\"Deeside Man Carries On Gilbert Traditions\\", Aberdeen Press and Journal, 13 December 1937, p. 6 In consultation with Rupert D'Oyly Carte, he was responsible for making major textual revisions to Ruddigore when it was revived, for the first time, in December 1921. Around the same time, he worked with the company's musical director, Harry Norris, to create the radically shortened \\"Savoy Edition\\" of Cox and Box, and he approved any changes to stage business, such as Darrell Fancourt's introduction of the Mikado's famous laugh.Joseph, p. 260 His relations with Malcolm Sargent, whom Carte brought in to conduct London seasons in 1926 and 1929–30, were less harmonious. Sargent's brisk tempos upset Gordon, who protested unavailingly that they interfered with the pacing of the stage action. Some senior company members agreed with Gordon, but Carte backed Sargent.Reid, pp. 142–43 Gordon retired in July 1939, but briefly came out of retirement in late 1939 and early 1940 to coach Grahame Clifford, who had taken over at short notice from Martyn Green as principal comedian. He died at his home in Brighton at the age of 87 after a fall in the wartime blackout.Gordon, Introduction His only surviving daughter, Lily, preserved many of his papers with information about the company's productions. His memoirs were edited by his great-niece Elizabeth Benney and published by Pitcairn-Knowles in 2014.Gordon, passim Reputation Many members of D'Oyly Carte wrote anecdotes about Gordon's dedication and the value of his instruction. Derek Oldham described him as: > a tiger for knowing and getting what he wanted! He was only really happy > when he was rehearsing. He loved rehearsing. ... He was the everlasting > secret joke of the Company ... and there were some funny tales. ... But he > had that company on its toes. It is sometimes said that the vintage years of > [the company] were from 1919 and the six years following. Well, they were > all due to old man Gordon. … Later, as he became older and tired, it showed > itself in the fact that he was not so flexible.

But what a producer when at his best. ... > Gordon gave me diction, much solid stage technique, and nursed the passion > and sincerity for my job.Taylor, Roy (ed). \\"Derek Oldham Remembers\\", at the > Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 21 December 2009 Viola Wilson, who was a soprano with the company near the end of Gordon's career, wrote this description in her memoir: > He worshipped Gilbert and this was reflected in his own productions. > Although a stickler for tradition, he believed first and foremost in > building up an intelligent performance.

Their clinical use has been established as anti-glaucoma agents, diuretics, antiepileptics, in the management of mountain sickness, gastric and duodenal ulcers, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, neurological disorders, or osteoporosis.  Medical uses  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are primarily used for the treatment of glaucoma. They may also be used to treat seizure disorder and acute mountain sickness. Because they encourage solubilization and excretion of uric acid, they can be used in the treatment of gout. =Glaucoma= Acetazolamide is an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase. It is used for glaucoma, epilepsy (rarely), idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and altitude sickness. For the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), acetazolamide inactivates carbonic anhydrase and interferes with the sodium pump, which decreases aqueous humor formation and thus lowers IOP. Systemic effects include increased loss of sodium, potassium, and water in the urine, secondary to the drug's effects on the renal tubules, where valuable components of filtered blood are re-absorbed in the kidney. Arterial Blood gases may show a mild hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Methazolamide is also a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. It has a longer elimination half-life than acetazolamide and is less associated with adverse effects to the kidney.Bennett WM, Aronoff GR, Golper TA, et al, Drug Prescribing in Renal Failure, American College of Physicians, Philadelphia, PA, 1987Product Information: Neptazane(R), methazolamide. Storz Ophthalmics Inc, Clearwater, FL, 1995aReynolds JEF (Ed): Martle: The Extra Pharmacopoeia (electronic version). Micromedex, Inc. Englewood, CO. 1995. Dorzolamide is a sulfonamide and topical carbonic anhydrase II inhibitor. It is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and who are insufficiently responsive to beta-blockers. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase II in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. Brinzolamide (trade names Azopt, Alcon Laboratories, Inc, Befardin Fardi Medicals) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to lower intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active of which is carbonic anhydrase II (CA- II). The combination of brinzolamide with timolol is marketed under the trade name Azarga. =Diuretic= Some diuretics inhibit the activity of carbonic anhydrase in proximal convoluted tubules and prevent reabsorption of bicarbonates from renal tubules. Lowered reabsorption of bicarbonates results in decreased activity of the apical sodium hydrogen exchanger, causing diuresis due to retention of sodium in the renal tubules. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Other examples are; * Dorzolamide * Methazolamide * Brinzolamide * Dichlorphenamide =Epilepsy= Acetazolamide is effective in the treatment of most types of seizures, including generalized tonic-clonic and focal seizures and especially absence seizures, although it has limited utility because tolerance develops with chronic use. The drug is occasionally used on an intermittent basis to prevent seizures in catamenial epilepsy. The sulfur-containing antiseizure and antimigraine drug topiramate is a weak inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, particularly subtypes II and IV. Whether carbonic anhydrase inhibition contributes to its clinical activity is not known. In rare cases, the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase may be strong enough to cause metabolic acidosis of clinical importance. Zonisamide is another sulfur containing antiseizure drug that weakly inhibits carbonic anhydrase. Sultiame is also an example of an anticonvulsant drug of this class. =Altitude sickness= At high altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen is lower and people have to breathe more rapidly to get adequate oxygen. When this happens, the partial pressure of CO2 in the lungs (pCO2) decreases (is \\"blown off\\"), causing a respiratory alkalosis. This would normally be compensated by the kidney excreting bicarbonate and causing compensatory metabolic acidosis, but this mechanism takes several days. A more immediate treatment is carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which prevent bicarbonate uptake in the kidney and help correct the alkalosis. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have also been shown to improve chronic mountain sickness. ContraindicationsHepatic cirrhosis Adverse effects Loss of bicarbonate may result in metabolic acidosis. Alkaline urine may increase the likelihood of kidney stones. Natural sources Ellagitannins extracted from the pericarps of Punica granatum, the pomegranate, such as punicalin, punicalagin, granatin B, gallagyldilactone, casuarinin, pedunculagin and tellimagrandin I, are carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

It has a Mohs hardness of 7 and a specific gravity of 3.3 to 3.34. Its indices of refraction are nα=1.660 - 1.671, nβ=1.673 - 1.683 and nγ=1.674 - 1.684. It occurs in boron-rich volcanic and sedimentary rocks which have undergone high grade metamorphism. It is also found in metamorphosed anorthosite complexes. Kornerupine is valued as a gemstone when it is found in translucent green to yellow shades. The emerald green varieties are especially sought after. It forms a solid solution series with prismatine. Strongly pleochroic, it appears green or reddish brown when viewed from different directions. It has a vitreous luster. It was first described in 1884 for an occurrence in Fiskernæs in southwest Greenland. It was named in honor of the Danish geologist, Andreas Nikolaus Kornerup (1857–1883). Although kornerupine was named in 1884, it was not until 1912 that gem-quality material was found and it remains uncommon to this day. Deposits are found in Burma (Myanmar), Canada (Quebec), Kenya, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and South Africa.

It is the quantum mechanical analog of relative entropy.  Motivation  For simplicity, it will be assumed that all objects in the article are finite-dimensional. We first discuss the classical case. Suppose the probabilities of a finite sequence of events is given by the probability distribution P = {p1...pn}, but somehow we mistakenly assumed it to be Q = {q1...qn}. For instance, we can mistake an unfair coin for a fair one. According to this erroneous assumption, our uncertainty about the j-th event, or equivalently, the amount of information provided after observing the j-th event, is :\\\\; - \\\\log q_j. The (assumed) average uncertainty of all possible events is then :\\\\; - \\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log q_j. On the other hand, the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution p, defined by :\\\\; - \\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log p_j, is the real amount of uncertainty before observation. Therefore the difference between these two quantities :\\\\; - \\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log q_j - \\\\left(- \\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log p_j\\\\right) = \\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log p_j - \\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log q_j is a measure of the distinguishability of the two probability distributions p and q. This is precisely the classical relative entropy, or Kullback–Leibler divergence: :D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\\\Q) = \\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log \\\\frac{p_j}{q_j} \\\\\\\\!. Note #In the definitions above, the convention that 0·log 0 = 0 is assumed, since limx → 0 x log x = 0\\\\. Intuitively, one would expect that an event of zero probability to contribute nothing towards entropy. #The relative entropy is not a metric. For example, it is not symmetric. The uncertainty discrepancy in mistaking a fair coin to be unfair is not the same as the opposite situation.  Definition  As with many other objects in quantum information theory, quantum relative entropy is defined by extending the classical definition from probability distributions to density matrices. Let ρ be a density matrix. The von Neumann entropy of ρ, which is the quantum mechanical analog of the Shannon entropy, is given by :S(\\\\rho) = - \\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\rho \\\\log \\\\rho. For two density matrices ρ and σ, the quantum relative entropy of ρ with respect to σ is defined by : S(\\\\rho \\\\ \\\\sigma) = - \\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\rho \\\\log \\\\sigma - S(\\\\rho) = \\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\rho \\\\log \\\\rho - \\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\rho \\\\log \\\\sigma = \\\\operatorname{Tr}\\\\rho (\\\\log \\\\rho - \\\\log \\\\sigma). We see that, when the states are classically related, i.e. ρσ = σρ, the definition coincides with the classical case. = Non-finite (divergent) relative entropy = In general, the support of a matrix M is the orthogonal complement of its kernel, i.e. \\\\text{supp}(M) = \\\\text{ker}(M)^\\\\perp . When considering the quantum relative entropy, we assume the convention that −s · log 0 = ∞ for any s > 0\\\\. This leads to the definition that :S(\\\\rho \\\\ \\\\sigma) = \\\\infty when :\\\\text{supp}(\\\\rho) \\\\cap \\\\text{ker}(\\\\sigma) eq 0. This can be interpreted in the following way. Informally, the quantum relative entropy is a measure of our ability to distinguish two quantum states where larger values indicate states that are more different. Being orthogonal represents the most different quantum states can be. This is reflected by non-finite quantum relative entropy for orthogonal quantum states. Following the argument given in the Motivation section, if we erroneously assume the state \\\\rho has support in \\\\text{ker}(\\\\sigma), this is an error impossible to recover from. However, one should be careful not to conclude that the divergence of the quantum relative entropy S(\\\\rho\\\\\\\\sigma) implies that the states \\\\rho and \\\\sigma are orthogonal or even very different by other measures. Specifically, S(\\\\rho\\\\\\\\sigma) can diverge when \\\\rho and \\\\sigma differ by a vanishingly small amount as measured by some norm. For example, let \\\\sigma have the diagonal representation \\\\sigma=\\\\sum_{n}\\\\lambda_nf_n\\\\rangle\\\\langle f_n with \\\\lambda_n>0 for n=0,1,2,\\\\ldots and \\\\lambda_n=0 for n=-1,-2,\\\\ldots where \\\\\\\\{f_n\\\\rangle, n\\\\in \\\\Z\\\\\\\\} is an orthonormal set. The kernel of \\\\sigma is the space spanned by the set \\\\\\\\{f_{n}\\\\rangle, n=-1,-2,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\}. Next let \\\\rho=\\\\sigma+\\\\epsilonf_{-1}\\\\rangle\\\\langle f_{-1} - \\\\epsilonf_1\\\\rangle\\\\langle f_1 for a small positive number \\\\epsilon. As \\\\rho has support (namely the state f_{-1}\\\\rangle) in the kernel of \\\\sigma, S(\\\\rho\\\\\\\\sigma) is divergent even though the trace norm of the difference (\\\\rho-\\\\sigma) is 2\\\\epsilon . This means that difference between \\\\rho and \\\\sigma as measured by the trace norm is vanishingly small as \\\\epsilon\\\\to 0 even though S(\\\\rho\\\\\\\\sigma) is divergent (i.e. infinite). This property of the quantum relative entropy represents a serious shortcoming if not treated with care.  Non-negativity of relative entropy  = Corresponding classical statement = For the classical Kullback–Leibler divergence, it can be shown that :D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\\\Q) = \\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log \\\\frac{p_j}{q_j} \\\\geq 0, and the equality holds if and only if P = Q. Colloquially, this means that the uncertainty calculated using erroneous assumptions is always greater than the real amount of uncertainty. To show the inequality, we rewrite :D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\\\Q) = \\\\sum_j p_j \\\\log \\\\frac{p_j}{q_j} = \\\\sum_j (- \\\\log \\\\frac{q_j}{p_j})(p_j). Notice that log is a concave function. Therefore -log is convex. Applying Jensen's inequality, we obtain : D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\\\Q) = \\\\sum_j (- \\\\log \\\\frac{q_j}{p_j})(p_j) \\\\geq - \\\\log ( \\\\sum_j \\\\frac{q_j}{p_j} p_j ) = 0. Jensen's inequality also states that equality holds if and only if, for all i, qi = (∑qj) pi, i.e. p = q. = The result = Klein's inequality states that the quantum relative entropy : S(\\\\rho \\\\ \\\\sigma) = \\\\operatorname{Tr}\\\\rho (\\\\log \\\\rho - \\\\log \\\\sigma). is non- negative in general. It is zero if and only if ρ = σ. Proof Let ρ and σ have spectral decompositions :\\\\rho = \\\\sum_i p_i v_i v_i ^* \\\\; , \\\\; \\\\sigma = \\\\sum_i q_i w_i w_i ^*.\\\\sum_i \\\\; , \\\\; \\\\sigma So :\\\\log \\\\rho = \\\\sum_i (\\\\log p_i) v_i v_i ^* \\\\; , \\\\; \\\\log \\\\sigma = \\\\sum_i (\\\\log q_i)w_i w_i ^*. Direct calculation gives :S(\\\\rho \\\\ \\\\sigma) := \\\\sum_k p_k \\\\log p_k - \\\\sum_{i,j} (p_i \\\\log q_j)  v_i ^* w_j ^2 := \\\\sum_i p_i ( \\\\log p_i - \\\\sum_j \\\\log q_j  v_i ^* w_j ^2) :\\\\;= \\\\sum_i p_i (\\\\log p_i - \\\\sum_j (\\\\log q_j )P_{ij}), where Pi j = vi*wj2. Since the matrix (Pi j)i j is a doubly stochastic matrix and log is a convex function, the above expression is :\\\\geq \\\\sum_i p_i (\\\\log p_i - \\\\log (\\\\sum_j q_j P_{ij})). Define ri = ∑jqj Pi j. Then {ri} is a probability distribution. From the non-negativity of classical relative entropy, we have :S(\\\\rho \\\\ \\\\sigma) \\\\geq \\\\sum_i p_i \\\\log \\\\frac{p_i}{r_i} \\\\geq 0. The second part of the claim follows from the fact that, since -log is strictly convex, equality is achieved in : \\\\sum_i p_i (\\\\log p_i - \\\\sum_j (\\\\log q_j )P_{ij}) \\\\geq \\\\sum_i p_i (\\\\log p_i - \\\\log (\\\\sum_j q_j P_{ij})) if and only if (Pi j) is a permutation matrix, which implies ρ = σ, after a suitable labeling of the eigenvectors {vi} and {wi}.  Joint convexity of relative entropy  The relative entropy is jointly convex. For 0\\\\leq \\\\lambda\\\\leq 1 and states \\\\rho_{1(2)}, \\\\sigma_{1(2)} we have D(\\\\lambda\\\\rho_1+(1-\\\\lambda)\\\\rho_2\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\sigma_1+(1-\\\\lambda)\\\\sigma_2)\\\\leq \\\\lambda D(\\\\rho_1\\\\\\\\sigma_1)+(1-\\\\lambda)D(\\\\rho_2\\\\\\\\sigma_2)  Monotonicity of relative entropy  The relative entropy decreases monotonically under completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) operations \\\\mathcal{N} on density matrices, S(\\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\rho)\\\\\\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\sigma))\\\\leq S(\\\\rho\\\\\\\\sigma). This inequality is called Monotonicity of quantum relative entropy.  An entanglement measure  Let a composite quantum system have state space :H = \\\\otimes _k H_k and ρ be a density matrix acting on H. The relative entropy of entanglement of ρ is defined by :\\\\; D_{\\\\mathrm{REE}} (\\\\rho) = \\\\min_{\\\\sigma} S(\\\\rho \\\\ \\\\sigma) where the minimum is taken over the family of separable states. A physical interpretation of the quantity is the optimal distinguishability of the state ρ from separable states. Clearly, when ρ is not entangled :\\\\; D_{\\\\mathrm{REE}} (\\\\rho) = 0 by Klein's inequality.  Relation to other quantum information quantities  One reason the quantum relative entropy is useful is that several other important quantum information quantities are special cases of it. Often, theorems are stated in terms of the quantum relative entropy, which lead to immediate corollaries concerning the other quantities. Below, we list some of these relations. Let ρAB be the joint state of a bipartite system with subsystem A of dimension nA and B of dimension nB. Let ρA, ρB be the respective reduced states, and IA, IB the respective identities. The maximally mixed states are IA/nA and IB/nB. Then it is possible to show with direct computation that :S(\\\\rho_{A}  I_{A}/n_A) = \\\\mathrm{log}(n_A)- S(\\\\rho_{A}), \\\\; :S(\\\\rho_{AB}  \\\\rho_{A} \\\\otimes \\\\rho_{B}) = S(\\\\rho_{A}) + S(\\\\rho_{B}) - S(\\\\rho_{AB}) = I(A:B), :S(\\\\rho_{AB}  \\\\rho_{A} \\\\otimes I_{B}/n_B) = \\\\mathrm{log}(n_B) + S(\\\\rho_{A}) - S(\\\\rho_{AB}) = \\\\mathrm{log}(n_B)- S(BA), where I(A:B) is the quantum mutual information and S(BA) is the quantum conditional entropy.

OSHA defines a near miss as an incident in which no property was damaged and no personal injury was sustained, but where, given a slight shift in time or position, damage or injury easily could have occurred. Near misses also may be referred to as close calls, near accidents, accident precursors, injury-free events and, in the case of moving objects, near collisions. A near miss is often an error, with harm prevented by other considerations and circumstances.My Near Miss DANIELLE OFRI, MAY 28, 2013 The phrase \\"near miss\\" should not be confused with the phrase \\"nearly a miss\\" which would imply a collision. Causes There are factors for a near miss related to the operator, and factors related to the context. Fatigue is an example for the former. The risk of a car crash after a more than 24h shift for physicians has been observed to increase by 168%, and the risk of near miss by 460%.When Doctors Don't Sleep, Talk of the Nation, National Public Radio, 13 December 2006. Factors relating to the context include time pressures, unfamiliar settings, and in the case of health care, diverse patients, and increased patient-to-nurse staffing ratio increases. Reporting, analysis and prevention Most safety activities are reactive and not proactive. Many organizations wait for losses to occur before taking steps to prevent a recurrence. Near miss incidents often precede loss producing events but are largely ignored because nothing (no injury, damage or loss) happened. Employees are not enlightened to report these close calls as there has been no disruption or loss in the form of injuries or property damage. Thus, many opportunities to prevent the accidents that the organization has not yet had are lost. Recognizing and reporting near miss incidents can make a major difference to the safety of workers within organizations. History has shown repeatedly that most loss producing events (accidents) were preceded by warnings or near accidents, sometimes also called close calls, narrow escapes or near hits.McKinnon, Ron C. Safety Management: Near Miss Identification, Recognition, and Investigation. In terms of human lives and property damage, near misses are cheaper, zero-cost learning opportunities (compared to learning from actual injury or property loss events) Getting a very high number of near misses is the goal as long as that number is within the organization's ability to respond and investigate - otherwise it is merely a paperwork exercise and a waste of time; it is possible to achieve a ratio of 100 near misses reported per loss event. Achieving and investigating a high ratio of near misses will find the causal factors and root causes of potential future accidents, resulting in about 95% reduction in actual losses. An ideal near miss event reporting system includes both mandatory (for incidents with high loss potential) and voluntary, non-punitive reporting by witnesses. A key to any near miss report is the \\"lesson learned\\". Near miss reporters can describe what they observed of the beginning of the event, and the factors that prevented loss from occurring. The events that caused the near miss are subjected to root cause analysis to identify the defect in the system that resulted in the error and factors that may either amplify or ameliorate the result. To prevent the near miss from happening again, the organization must institute teamwork training, feedback on performance and a commitment to continued data collection and analysis, a process called continuous improvement. Near misses are smaller in scale, relatively simpler to analyze and easier to resolve. Thus, capturing near misses not only provides an inexpensive means of learning, but also has some equally beneficial spin offs: * Captures sufficient data for statistical analysis; trending studies. * Provides immense opportunity for \\"employee participation,\\" a basic requirement for a successful workplace health and safety program. This embodies principles of behavior shift, responsibility sharing, awareness, and incentives. * One of the primary workplace problems near miss incident reporting attempts to solve directly or indirectly is to try to create an open culture whereby everyone shares and contributes in a responsible manner. Near-Miss reporting has been shown to increase employee relationships and encourage teamwork in creating a safer work environment. Safety improvements by reports Reporting of near misses by observers is an established error reduction technique in many industries and organizations: =Aviation= In the United States, the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) has been collecting confidential voluntary reports of close calls from pilots, flight attendants, air traffic controllers since 1976. The system was established after TWA Flight 514 crashed on approach to Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C., killing all 85 passengers and seven crew in 1974. The investigation that followed found that the pilot misunderstood an ambiguous response from the Dulles air traffic controllers, and that earlier another airline had told its pilots, but not other airlines, about a similar near miss. The ASRS identifies deficiencies and provides data for planning improvements to stakeholders without regulatory action. Some familiar safety rules, such as turning off electronic devices that can interfere with navigation equipment, are a result of this program. Due to near miss observations and other technological improvements, the rate of fatal accidents has dropped about 65 percent, to one fatal accident in about 4.5 million departures, from one in nearly 2 million in 1997. In the United Kingdom, an aviation near miss report is known as an \\"airprox\\", an air proximity hazard, by the Civil Aviation Authority. Since reporting began, aircraft near misses continue to decline.Civil Aviation Authority: UK Airprox Board , Retrieved July 16, 2006 =Fire-rescue services= The rate of fire fighter fatalities and injuries in the United States is unchanged for the last 15 years despite improvements in personal protective equipment, apparatus and a decrease in structure fires.National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System (www.firefighternearmiss.com): FAQ Retrieved July 16, 2006 In 2005, the National Fire Fighter Near-Miss Reporting System was established, funded by grants from the U.S. Fire Administration and Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company, and endorsed by the International Associations of Fire Chiefs and Fire Fighters.

He set five world records and also won a further three silver and one bronze medal in his Olympic career. Early life Andrew 'Boy' Charlton, ca. 1924 Charlton was born in Crows Nest, Sydney, as the only son of Oswald and Ada Charlton. The accounts of his early life vary: the Australian Dictionary of Biography states that his father was a bank manager, while other sources suggest that he was raised in low socio-economic conditions and relied on benefactors to support his career. He was raised in the northern seaside suburb of Manly and was educated at Manly Village Public School and later Sydney Grammar School. Charlton was a member of North Steyne Surf Life Saving club in his teens, before transferring to Manly Life Saving Club in the mid 1920sNorth Steyne SLSC Annual Report 1924 Swimming Charlton first came to public attention in 1921 when he won a 440 yd freestyle race in the open division at a New South Wales Swimming Association competition in 5 min 45 s. It was his youth that led to his nickname \\"Boy\\". In 1922 Bill Harris, the bronze medallist in the 100m freestyle at the 1920 Summer Olympics, came to Australia from Honolulu to compete against the likes of Frank Beaurepaire and Moss Christie. Charlton defeated Harris at the New South Wales Championships, winning the 440 yd in 5 min 22.4 s. He then set a world record of 11m 5.4s in the 880yd event, as well as winning the one mile race in 23 min 43.2 s. Charlton used a trudgen stroke which embodied characteristics of the modern crawl stroke, which was at the time in its infancy.Boy Charlton. sports-reference.com In 1923, the 15-year-old Charlton swam for the first time against Beaurepaire, who had won 35 Australian championships and had set 15 world records in his career. The Manly Baths was filled to capacity for the 440 yd race, with Charlton winning the race by two yards in a time of 5m 20.4s, which led to Beaurepaire predicting that fitness permitting, Charlton would break world records in 1924. The start of 1924 in Australia was highlighted by the arrival of Swedish swimmer Arne Borg, at the time the holder of four world records, to compete against the 16-year-old Charlton in the 440yd freestyle at the New South Wales Championships. The Domain Baths were filled to capacity with between 5000 and 8000 spectators, 400m queues forming outside the venue. Borg held the lead for the first half of the race until Charlton drew level, taking the lead at the 320yd mark. Charlton eventually won by 20yds to equal Borg's world record of 5 min 11.8 s. Charlton was given a lap of honour as Borg rowed him around the pool in a small boat. They again met in the 880yd and 220yd events, with Charlton winning the former in a world record time of 10 min 51.8 s and the latter in an Australian record of 2 min 23.8 s. Three Olympics Charlton was selected for the Australian team for the 1924 Summer Olympics and travelled to Paris by sea with his coach, Tom Adriann, who was also appointed the team coach. On the way, Adriann suffered a nervous breakdown, and threw himself overboard. Even though Adriann was rescued, he was left in London while the team travelled to Paris without a coach. Then, while in Paris, Charlton competed in his first event, the 1500 m freestyle. He won both his heat and his semi-final, qualifying for the final, where he lined up against Borg and Beaurepaire. In the final, Borg immediately claimed the lead and maintained it until the 300 m mark, when Charlton moved alongside him. Charlton forged ahead to lead by 5 metres at the 600 m, before proceeding to defeat Borg by 40 m, while lapping the remainder of the field to win gold in a new world record time of 20m 6.6s. In the 400 m freestyle, Charlton again lined up against Borg and Johnny Weissmuller of the United States. Charlton progressed to the final, finishing second to Weissmuller in both his heat and semi-final. In the final, Charlton, the distance specialist, trailed far behind as Borg and Weissmuller contested the lead. Charlton was eight metres behind at the 150 m mark, before making his move. However, he left it too late and finished a metre behind the leaders, finishing with the bronze medal. Charlton then combined with Ernest Henry, Moss Christie and Beaurepaire to claim silver in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay behind the United States. Although Charlton had claimed the lead from the Americans in the second leg, the two following Australians were overwhelmed, losing by nine seconds, with the Americans setting another world record. Boy Charlton in 1928 Physiologists had become involved in sport at the time of the Paris Olympics and Charlton's lung capacity was tested with a machine, which blew mercury through a set of bent tubes. They could not believe his lung capacity. It was the highest lung capacity of anyone they had rated at that time – only 16 years of age. After the games, Charlton declared that swimming would take a back seat to his study and work career, and declined offers to tour the US and Europe. However, he still won the 200 m, 400 m and 800 m events at the Tailteann Games. He resumed studies at Hawkesbury Agricultural College, but did not graduate and subsequently became a station-hand at Kurrumbede station in Gunnedah, in western New South Wales. Charlton limited his training to irregular visits to Sydney, when he consulted his coach, former Olympic medallist Henry Hay. After a two-year absence from competition, he returned to the New South Wales championships in 1927, setting a world record of 10m 32s in the on his return. He was again victorious in the in an Australian record time of 4 min 59.8 s. Charlton again returned to his inland job in Gunnedah before returning to Sydney the following year to secure qualification for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam by winning the New South Wales championships. In Amsterdam, in the 1500 m, Charlton finished second behind Borg in his heat, before trailing Buster Crabbe home in the semi-final. Borg went on to set a new Olympic record to defeat Charlton by 15 m. In the 400 m, Charlton again finished second in both his heat and semi-final. He again claimed the silver medal, finishing behind Argentina's Alberto Zorrilla. In total, Charlton won five Olympic medals, which was a record until 1960. After shelving his swimming career on his return to Australia for four years, Charlton again broke the Australian record in both the 440 and freestyle events at the 1932 New South Wales championships to gain selection for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, the oldest member of the team at 25 years of age. He contracted influenza a fortnight before the Games after arriving in the United States. Charlton raised hopes that he had recovered when he won his heat, but then only won third place in the semi-final, although he still progressed to the final of the 400 m freestyle. Charlton finished in a distant sixth, some ten seconds behind the winner. In the 1500 metres, Charlton finished second in his heat, before coming fifth in his semi-final, resulting in his elimination. While in Los Angeles, Charlton was offered the chance to audition in Hollywood. Weissmuller had done 12 \\"Tarzan\\" movies and was now Jungle Jim.

The male has a dark emerald green throat, yellow crown, pale brown below and narrow yellow throat collar. It closely resembles the crimson-plumed Raggiana bird-of-paradise, but has apricot orange rather than crimson flank plumes. The female is an overall brown bird with yellow head and dark brown face. The Empress of Germany's bird of paradise is distributed and endemic to upper Ramu River and Huon Peninsula of northeastern Papua New Guinea. The male is polygamous and displays in communal lek. The diet consists mainly of fruits, insects and arthropods. One of the most heavily hunted birds of paradise in the plume hunting era, the Empress of Germany's bird of paradise was the first bird of paradise to breed in captivity. It was bred by Prince K. S. Dharmakumarsinhji of India in 1940. The name commemorates the German Empress and queen consort of Prussia, Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. In the wild, the Empress of Germany's bird of paradise is hybridized with the emperor bird-of-paradise, with at least six specimens known.

They include dental assistants (known as dental nurses in the United Kingdom and Ireland), dental therapists, dental hygienists, dental technologists, and orthodontic auxiliaries. The role of dental auxiliaries is usually limited by regional dental regulations, which help define the boundaries of treatment that can be performed. Dental assistants Dental assistant help make dental treatment more efficient by assisting the dental care provider. They hold and pass instruments, retract tissues and apply suction to assist better vision of the operating field. They also mix materials, help maintain dental records, and sterilize instruments and equipment. Some also engage in professional teeth whitening procedures, particularly in The Republic of Ireland where laser teeth whitening is classified as a cosmetic procedure and not dental treatment. This practice usually occurs in clinics solely devoted to laser teeth whitening and not routine dental treatment. Dental therapists Dental therapists are licensed dental auxiliaries in some countries. They specialized in caring for children's teeth and oral hygiene. Local dental regulations determine the duties therapists are allowed to perform. Typically, therapists under the prescription of a dentist are licensed to examine children's teeth, administer some forms of local anesthesia, take radiographs, and provide sealants, scaling, and cleaning for children. They also may work in restoring primary teeth and administer vital pulp treatments such as pulpotomies. Dental hygienists Dental hygienists are licensed dental professionals who specialize in preventive dental care and the treatment of periodontal (gum) conditions. National dental regulations determine the duties hygienists are trained and competent to perform. In most jurisdictions, Dental Hygienist work within a team dental practice (office) and are licensed to administer local anesthesia. Other responsibilities are in dental radiography, fissure sealants, scaling & stain removal, dental bleaching, treatment of roots in cases of periodontal disease and monitoring/maintenance therapy regimes . Dental technologists Dental technologists are dental professionals who fabricate dental appliances: removable protheses including dentures and orthodontic retainers, and fixed restorative work such as crown and bridges for the dental operator to insert. Denturists or clinical dental technicians are dental technicians with postgraduate training who see patients to fabric and fit dentures.

She came to prominence by investigating the forced disappearances of thousands of people during the Dirty War. She later served as a deputy, senator, and government minister for the FrePaSo party. Biography Graciela Castagnola was born in Avellaneda just south of Buenos Aires, where she met her husband, Enrique Fernández Meijide, at a young age. They had a daughter and two sons, and she worked as a French language teacher. In 1976, her 16-year-old son, Pablo, was taken by the authorities in a night- time raid on the family apartment, along with his girlfriend, María Zimmermann, in what appears to be a case of mistaken identity (the girl's former boyfriend was a student activist also named Pablo). They were not seen again by their families. Fernández Meijide campaigned for the rights of the families of the disappeared during the Dirty War of the 1970s. She lived in exile in Montreal for a period and joined the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights. At the return of democracy in 1983, she was appointed to head the depositions department of the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP). =Political career= Although Fernández Meijide was approached by several parties after her high-profile work, it was not until the creation of the centre-left Broad Front that she started a political career, having seen the passing into law of the controversial 'Pardon Laws' (the Ley de Obediencia Debida and the Ley de Punto Final) that effectively ended further prosecution for those responsible for human rights abuses during the National Reorganization Process dictatorship (1976-83). She stood as a candidate for the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1991 on the center-left Broad Front ticket, albeit without success. Fernández Meijide was first elected to Congress in 1993 as a Deputy for the City of Buenos Aires on the newly formed FrePaSo (Front for a Country in Solidarity) ticket. She was elected to the Argentine Senate in 1995 for the city. During this time the newly formed FrePaSo's popularity and her own grew. In 1997, she resigned her seat in the Senate and was elected a deputy once again - now for Buenos Aires Province - in a resounding victory over Justicialist Chiche Duhalde, greatly increasing her profile. FrePaSo joined with the Radical Civic Union (UCR) and several provincial parties to create the Alianza in opposition to President Carlos Menem, and she led the Alianza party list to a majority in the Lower House in the 1997 mid-term elections. Ahead of the 1999 elections, Fernández Meijide ran in the Alianza presidential primary against UCR Senator Fernando de la Rúa, to whom she lost despite having been the front-runner in many polls. She declined to be de la Rúa's running mate and instead announced her candidacy for Governor of Buenos Aires Province; she lost to Justicialist Party nominee Carlos Ruckauf by 7 points, however. De la Rúa, on the other hand, was elected President, and he appointed Fernández Meijide to his cabinet as Minister of Social Development and Environment. She was unable to put many of her social plans into action, however, due to lack of funds, and her popularity waned as the public's impatience grew. In a 2001 cabinet reshuffle brought on by economic and social crisis, the president made her chief of cabinet; she however resigned after a few days in protest at the government's economic policies. De la Rúa's government and the Alianza subsequently collapsed in 2001, after which both the UCR and FrePaSo backed the congressionally-appointed presidency of Eduardo Duhalde to remedy the country's economic crisis. Fernández Meijide afterward retired from active politics. Her Intimate History of Human Rights in Argentina was published in 2009.

He subsequently became a leading surgeon and medical administrator.  Swimming career  Theile was born in Maryborough to Alice and Egmont Theile, who ran a husband and wife medical practice. Both had graduated from the University of Sydney, with his father originally being of German descent. He learnt to swim at the age of five, along with his three sisters after being enrolled in a swimming program by his parents. He developed a love of swimming, which relieved him from the boredom of the town, as \\"the local pool gave us something to do\\". By the age of 10, Theile was enjoying success at local swimming carnivals, so his father offered to arrange for him to be coached, but left Theile with the choice of coaches. Of the two coaches in the town, Theile chose Arthur Cusack, who had a reputation as a physical training instructor of whom Theile recounted as being \\"tough and enthusiastic. All my friends avoided him....somehow I sensed that it was an important decision.\\" Cusack turned out to be his lifelong coach. Under the guidance of Cusack, Maryborough Swimming Club challenged the metropolitan clubs in Brisbane for statewide supremacy. Theile won Queensland junior and open titles in all four strokes. In 1954, at the age of 16, he came second in the open backstroke, and after becoming the national junior champion that year, he decided to concentrate on the given stroke. In 1955, he captured the 110yd backstroke title at the Australian Championships in Adelaide. At the same time, Theile completed his secondary education and was awarded an academic scholarship to study medicine at the University of Queensland. In 1956, he was selected to represent Australia in the Melbourne Olympics, and he was forced to defer his studies. He won the 110 yd Queensland backstroke title before retaining his Australian title in Sydney. He joined the Australian team at the 12-week winter camp in Townsville, where he worked under the tutelage of Forbes Carlile. At the Townsville camp, Theile initially swam slower in the time trials than John Monckton and John Hayres, but eventually defeated them in the final time trials. At a later Brisbane event, he won again in 64.5 s, but Monckton defeated him in Sydney with a new record time of 63.3 s. However, Theile later struck back with a time of 62.9 s at the final trials in Melbourne, setting a new world record for long-course events. At the 1956 Olympics, only a 100-metre backstroke event existed, in which there were 25 competitors. Theile won his heat to qualify second fastest for the semifinals behind Monckton, who set an Olympic record in his heat. After some officials had questioned his turning style during the heats, Theile refused to give a demonstration to the judges as his team manager had previously promised them. He used a conventional in the semifinals as did the others, coming second to Monckton to progress to the final. In the final Theile made a good start and seized the lead from the start, never relinquishing it to win by more than a metre and a half from Monckton, setting a new world and Olympic record. Subsequent to the Olympic Games were the 1957 Queensland Championships, where Theile was disqualified for the only time in his career, after officials ruled that he had performed an illegal turn. Theile resumed his university studies in medicine, and skipped the Australian Championships, allowing Monckton to win both the 110 yd and 220 yd backstroke events. In 1958, Monckton took the 110 yd backstroke world record as National Service prevented Theile from competing. Theile also skipped the 1958 Empire Games in Cardiff to pursue his academic career. In 1959, he competed in the Australian Championships at the behest of the Australian Swimming Federation, who paid his fares to Hobart to compete, where he won the 110 yd title in a time of 64 s, well outside his best. He subsequently returned to medical studies for the rest of the year, when he moved to Warwick, Queensland, south of Brisbane to resume training with Cusack. Theile won the 1960 Australian Championships before deciding on an attempt to defend his Olympic title. Again, he had to attend a winter training camp in Townsville, which necessitated him applying for special consideration from his university, which obliged by allowing him to undergo his training during the year at Townsville Hospital. He was able to train with Cusack in Townsville, who was appointed as a team coach. Theile won the final trials in Townsville to gain selection for his second Olympics, along with Monckton. Theile arrived in Rome as an outsider, despite being the defending champion as he had not regained his form of four years prior, with Robert Bennett and Frank McKinney of the United States posting faster times. This appeared to be the case in the heats, with Theile posting the third fastest time behind the American duo. In the semifinals, Bennett was unable to repeat his earlier performance and Theile won, while McKinney won the other semifinal, also in a time slower than Theile. Theile was confident approaching the final, recounting \\"I had great faith in myself and my abilities. I had a short, sharp peak, which meant that I had to save everything for that burst and then exert everything I had for precisely that moment.\\" Theile attacked at the outset in the final, as was his style, and held a slender lead at the 50-metre mark over McKinney and Bennett. Theile made a good turn, lengthening his lead to half a body length, before holding off a late surge to claim consecutive gold medals, defeating McKinney by just 0.2 s, setting a new Olympic record in the event. For the first time, the 4×100-metre medley relay was contested at the Olympics, and combining with Terry Gathercole, Neville Hayes and Geoff Shipton, the Australians finished well behind the Americans to win the silver medal. After the games, FINA announced that the 100-metre would be dropped in favour of the 200-metre backstroke. Theile, a sprinter, immediately announced his retirement thereafter. He completed his medical studies in 1962, and was a member of the organising committee of the 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane.  Medical career  Theile undertook post-graduate training as a Resident and Surgical Registrar at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, and was awarded a fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 1967. After obtaining further experience in the United Kingdom, in 1974 he entered private practice as a general surgeon in Brisbane, and was appointed to the visiting staff of the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Over the succeeding 25 years, Theile earned an array of professional accolades. Alongside his fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, he was made a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and an Honorary Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists. He holds three honorary professorships, and is an honorary member of the medical academies of both Singapore and Malaysia. He has been awarded an honorary Doctorate of Philosophy by the University of Queensland, and is an Officer of the Order of Australia. He is currently appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Metro South Health Service District. Apart from his clinical practice, Theile also began to take an active part in professional affairs. From 1981, he held a variety of positions with the Royal Australian College of Surgeons, culminating in the presidency between 1993 and 1995. He served on the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee. He chaired the Pacific Islands Project for AusAid. He became Chairman of the Division of Surgery at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in 2000, and in 2006 became its Clinical Chief Executive Officer. In 2001, Theile was awarded the highest honour from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, the Sir Hugh Devine Medal.

The song is still very popular also in Finnish karaokebars and in \\"finnhits\\"-discos. The song is sung as a suggestion to a fellow traveller that, instead of finding accommodation for the night, the pair \\"hang around the [train] station\\" until the morning - when their train leaves at 5:30am. Ultimately, however, they miss that train as well. Kirka also recorded the song in English, then under the title \\"C'mon Let's Boogie\\".

Written by Ann M. Martin, the series centered on seven-year-old Karen Brewer, the stepsister to Kristy Thomas, who is President of The Baby-Sitters Club. In this series, Karen is a second grader at Stoneybrook Academy. The stories are about the adventures that Karen and her friends have. Karen usually tries to do the right thing, but because she has been through some hard times in her young life, she sometimes makes a mistake. She does, however, learn from her mistakes. In the beginning of the series, Karen and her younger brother, Andrew, live primarily with their mother, Lisa, and stepfather, Seth Engle. Karen and Andrew do not get to spend much time with their father, Watson Brewer, and stepmother, Elizabeth Thomas-Brewer. Therefore, they end up missing the extended family so much that they request to spend equal time with both families. Although the series covered holiday celebrations every year in real-time, Karen only celebrated her birthday once (she turned seven years old in Baby-Sitters Little Sister #7, Karen's Birthday). On April 30, 2019, it was announced that there are plans for a series of Baby-Sitters Little Sister graphic novels illustrated by Katy Farina and colored by Braden Lamb.

A VS-2.2 landmine found in Iraq in 2004. The VS-2.2, VS-3.6 and SH-55 are Italian circular plastic cased anti-tank blast mines that use the VS-N series fuze. They have very few metal components and are resistant to overpressure and shock. The VS-2.2 and VS-3.6 can also be deployed from helicopters. It was produced by Valsella Meccanotecnica and Singapore, but production has ceased. The VS-2.2 and VS-3.6 are essentially the same, the VS-3.6 being slightly larger, the SH-55 is larger still and has a more rounded appearance. A smaller mine, the VS-1.6 also uses the same fuze. Description The mines are normally olive green or sand coloured and are circular. The VS-2.2 and VS-3.6 consist of a ribbed main body containing the main charge and a large circular VS-N fuze which sits on top. The SH-55 is larger, and the circular main body is not as ribbed, it uses the same VS-N fuze as the other mines. The VS-N fuze is air pressure driven with pressure on the top plate of the mine forcing air into a diaphragm which exerts pressure on the striker until a retaining ball is forced into a recess. Shocks from overpressure are too short to inflate the diaphragm, this requires gradual pressure giving even greater resistance to shock. This mine has a secondary fuze well on the bottom (where it cannot be seen) which is slightly off-set from the centre of the mine. This secondary fuze well can easily be fitted with pull-fuze which functions as an anti-handling device. The main charge of the VS-2.2 is relatively small for an anti-tank mine, so it would tend to disable rather than destroy vehicles, however the VS-3.6 and SH-55 may penetrate the hull of armoured vehicles. The VS-2.2 mine is found in Iraq and Kuwait, the SH-55 is found in Afghanistan. Specifications {class=wikitable ! Mine  VS-2.2  VS-3.6  SH-55 - ! Weight  3.5 kg  5 kg  7.3 kg - !

While most characters feature in multiple titles in the series, every new addition introduces many new characters. There are also only four key protagonists who feature in every title. Japanese voice actors and voice actors for Boogiepop Phantom, as well as actors for Boogiepop and Others, are listed under the appropriate character. A list of all titles the character appears in is also present for each of the minor characters. Protagonists ; * (Boogiepop Phantom), Aoi Yūki (Japanese); Michelle Rojas (Boogiepop and Others) (English) * Japanese actor: Sayaka Yoshino (Boogiepop and Others) :While many female students at Shinyo Academy whisper of a shinigami, few people know that Boogiepop actually exists. He is the alter-ego of Touka Miyashita. Normally dormant, Boogiepop rises to the surface to fight the enemies of the world when they appear. Boogiepop's appearance and voice are ambiguous: they seem both masculine and feminine at the same time. However, hidden beneath his signature black cloak and black, pipe-shaped hat, little is ever seen of him. Straight-faced and to the point, Boogiepop acts as mechanical as he claims to be. Boogiepop speaks in an archaic manner and seems fond of whistling Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. Boogiepop's name is explained in the series: \\"When I detect adversity approaching, I float to the surface. That's why I am Boogiepop – phantasmal, like bubbles.\\" :The backstory, where Boogiepop first inhabits Miyashita as a child, is described in Boogiepop at Dawn. In Boogiepop and Others, Boogiepop holds vigil over Shinyo Academy. He establishes a meaningful friendship with Takeda Keiji, as they sat each day and spoke to each other, mainly about Boogiepop's nature, but also about personal topics from Takeda's life. After Manticore reveals itself and attacks Niitoki Kei, Boogiepop intervenes, using his microfilament wire so that Tanaka Shiro could finish it off. Manticore crosses Boogiepop's path again in Boogiepop Phantom in the form of his two residual aspects: Saotome Masami, who continues to be a direct threat, and Boogiepop Phantom, who seeks to protect highly evolved humans from the Towa Organisation. When strange incidents occur around Miyashita, Boogiepop tracks down Poom Poom and faces his creator, Kisaragi Manaka. Once Manaka loses her power, however, Boogiepop has no further interest in her death and protects her from Boogiepop Phantom. When Miyashita travels to Tokyo for her University entrance exam, Boogiepop arises and heads to Akihabara, where he corners and finally defeats Manticore. Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1 sees Boogiepop investigating the possible return of Imaginator, another one of Boogiepop's recurring foes, while being the target of the Towa Organisation. Using Anou Shinjirou as bait, Boogiepop lures out Spooky E and attempts to kill him, but the synthetic human manages to escape. :Boogiepop keeps minimal contact with other people and as such there are few who know much about him. While the paths of Boogiepop and Nagi Kirima tend to cross, as they both seek to protect the world, they have had little interaction. Their relationship is not a close one either, with Kirima resenting the way Boogiepop comes and goes as it is convenient. In Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator, we learn about Boogiepop's previous battle with Imaginator. Boogiepop has little further interaction with other characters until he meets with Anou Shinjirou, his lead to Spooky E. ; * (Boogiepop Phantom), Aoi Yūki (Japanese); Michelle Rojas (Boogiepop and Others) (English) * Japanese actor: Sayaka Yoshino (Boogiepop and Others) : An ordinary, happy school girl at Shinyo Academy, Miyashita is in love with her boyfriend, Takeda Keiji, and close friends with Suema Kazuko. She finds it troublesome to deal with Niitoki Kei, partly because Niitoki has a crush on Takeda, but more so because Niitoki has met Boogiepop and as such knows both sides of the person. Not particularly good at school, she does not stand out in any way. Unknown to most, she was hospitalized as a child and this saw her life change, though even Miyashita herself does not seem to know the truth of what happened and was simply told that she had been possessed by a kitsune. Unknowingly, when the world is in trouble, she carries a Spalding sports bag containing the effects of Boogiepop, her alternate personality. She has no recollection of her time as Boogiepop and alters her memories to explain the blanks. ; * (Boogiepop Phantom), Saori Ōnishi (Japanese), Morgan Garrett (English) (Boogiepop and Others) * Japanese actor: Maya Kurosu (Boogiepop and Others) :Known as the Fire Witch to many, Kirima has few friends due to the way she distances herself from others: she knows that she is too dangerous for \\"normal\\" people to associate with. She lives with her stepbrother, Taniguchi Masaki, though he is unaware of her actions or lifestyle. She has a messiah complex and seeks to save the world from whatever may threaten it. Having lost her father, the famous writer Seiichi Kirima, and her first love when she was quite young, she seemingly lives both their lives in place of her own. DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson and Rachel Lillis (2001) Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 3 Gifted both physically and intellectually, she has the tools she needs to carry out her self-appointed mission. The Towa Organization has given her the code name \\"Walpurgis\\" . :Her backstory, where Kirima becomes a self- styled \\"hero of justice\\", is described in full detail in Boogiepop at Dawn. In Boogiepop and Others, Kirima's friend Naoko Kamikishiro requests her assistance with helping Echoes find Manticore and keep it from killing students at Shinyo Academy. Kirima agrees; she intentionally gets herself suspended from school, to gain the freedom to investigate. Following the trail of the drug, Type-S, Kirima comes to suspect that Manticore has taken the form of either Niitoki Kei, Saotome Masami or Tanaka Shiro. As Manticore attacks Echoes, Saotome slashes Kirima's throat, killing her. However, when Echoes turns into light to kill Manticore, he uses some of his power to resurrect Kirima. Kazuko Suema also attempts to draw close to Kirima during this time, despite her attempts to distance herself from everyone, which develops into an awkward friendship. In Boogiepop Phantom, she is investigating the aftermath of the \\"pillar of light\\" incident and the nature of the electromagnetic field around the city, seeking to stop the events that it causes. Her investigations reveal that Manticore is still alive, so she attempts to end matters with electromagnetic pulse blasts; Boogiepop Phantom intervenes to stop this plan. Her investigations ultimately lead her to Paisley Park, where Poom Poom and Manaka attempt to bring her to their side, but prove hostile when she resists. In the end, Boogiepop's intervention saves her. Even though they are both fighting for the same goals, Kirima dislikes Boogiepop. :Throughout her story, the main theme is how a childhood trauma can influence the growth of an individual. Nagi means \\"calm\\" or \\"lull\\". \\"After a storm comes a calm\\" is a Japanese proverb, which can also be translated as, \\"after a storm comes Nagi\\", referring to how she tends to resolve certain situations. The \\"kiri\\" in Kirima means \\"mist\\" and the \\"ma\\" means \\"space\\", \\"time\\" or \\"pause\\". ; * (Boogiepop Phantom), Reina Kondō (Japanese); Natalie Hoover (English) * Japanese actor: Mami Shimizu (Boogiepop and Others) : Having once been marked as the next target of a serial killer, Suema develops an unusual interest and knowledge in criminal and abnormal psychology, as well as the desire to not let anything occur around her without her knowing. Suema struggles to find acceptance among her peers at Shinyo Academy. They look upon her as weird and exclude her, as a result of her unusual interests, though she is friends with Kinoshita Kyoko. In Boogiepop and Others, Suema first hears the rumours about Boogiepop, but dismisses them as fantasy, although she investigates a possible sighting of the shinigami. After seeing Nagi Kirima interrogate Kinoshita, Suema searches for Kirima's house and tries to learn what she can from her. She comes to learn that Kirima was involved with stopping the serial killer who had been stalking her, but was surprised to hear the claim that it was Boogiepop who saved her. Their relationship remains distant, despite Suema's efforts to change this. In Boogiepop Phantom, Suema meets Touka Miyashita for the first time and they quickly become close friends. She is relatively unaware of events as they unfold, and is entirely focused on studying for her University entrance exams with Miyashita. Suema appreciates how she is so unconditionally accepting of her and looks out for her friend. In Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1, we learn that Suema and Niitoki Kei are on friendly terms. Suema is approached by Kotoe Kinukawa, who seeks her help in regard to her relative, Jin Asukai. Suema investigates him and realises that something unusual is happening. After seeing a sketch of Suiko Minahoshi in Asukai's office, she goes to the place where Minahoshi had died, only to meet Aya Orihata for the first time and encourage her to take pleasure in life and fulfill her goals. Suema repeatedly just misses learning about what is really going on in the city. Throughout her story, the major theme is how a childhood trauma can influence the growth of an individual. Her backstory, where Suema was stalked by the serial killer, is described in full detail in Boogiepop at Dawn.  Boogiepop and Others  ; * (Boogiepop Phantom), Kōki Miyata (Boogiepop and Others) * Japanese actor: Yasufumi Teriwaki (Boogiepop and Others) : An alien sent to Earth to evaluate humanity. When Echoes takes on human form to engage with human society, he inadvertently takes on a form more highly evolved than current humans. His knowledge is sealed away by restricting his ability to speak to only repeating the words used by others around him. This is why he is named Echoes, in reference to the Greek nymph, Echo. The names of many characters in the Boogiepop series are also references to Western music, particularly rock. Echoes is a song from the album Meddle by Pink Floyd. Sometime after coming to Earth, he was captured by the Towa Organization, who misinterpreted him as a mutant human and experimented on him, creating their synthetic humans from what they learned. They also attempted to clone Echoes, but their failed attempt resulted in the creation of the human-eating Manticore. When Manticore escaped from the lab in which it was created, Echoes gave chase. Boogiepop and Others begins with Echoes becoming disheartened in his search and disillusioned with humanity. As he collapses in the middle of the city, Boogiepop gives him the encouragement he needs and helps him when he is mistreated by the Police. He then meets Naoko Kamikishiro, with whom he shares a telepathic link. Kamikishiro learns about who he is, what he has been through and what he is trying to do. She shelters him at Shinyo Academy and calls for her friend, Nagi Kirima, to help. After Kamikishiro disappears, Kirima captures three students, believing that Manticore would be disguised as one of them, but Echoes senses that they are all ordinary humans. After he releases the students, one of them, Saotome Masami, stabs him through the throat with a poisoned mechanical pencil. With Echoes weakened, Manticore reveals itself, and attacks him. Echoes is unable to face Manticore and is bitterly defeated. When all hope seems lost, Echoes speaks his own words for the only time: \\"my body into information, transmit to source.\\" At this, Echoes turns into a pillar of light that passes through his enemies, disintegrating Saotome Masami and mortally wounding Manticore. From Echoes' perspective, we are able to see how unjust prejudice is. He also demonstrates how insensitive modern society is to the unfortunate. :Boogiepop Phantom often references the pillar of light and, just like Echoes, Kisaragi Manaka speaks in repetition. Echoes makes a brief appearance at the end of the second-last episode. : Appearances: Boogiepop and Others, Boogiepop at Dawn, Boogiepop Phantom ;  Japanese actor: Asumi Miwa : A third year student at Shinyo Academy who is going out with both Kimura Akio and Tanaka Shiro.

It escaped from the lab it was created in, hoping to preserve its life. Minako started as a loner, so Manticore finds it easy to hide itself by interacting with as few people as possible. \\"Manticore\\" means \\"man-eater\\". The Manticore in Boogiepop and Others feeds on humans and gained its name after the Persian monster for this reason. Manticore initially aims only to survive and hide among human society. Saotome Masami, however, led it to believe in its own superiority. After killing Minako, Masami discovers Manticore, but before it can kill him, Saotome explains why Manticore would find Yurihara's form more beneficial and confesses his love to it. Listening to Saotome's logic, Manticore lets him live and help it, assuming the form of Yurihara to hide from its pursuer, Echoes, for whose superior power it held a deep-set fear. Believing itself safely hidden, Manticore managed to avoid conflict until it believed it had Echoes trapped, at which point it attacked him. As it begins to take on more human attributes, its motivations shift towards love. Seeking to align himself with Manticore, Saotome inquires to what other powers it possesses and gleefully explains how these powers could be used to control the world. When Manticore tells Saotome of its powers, he initiates experiments in controlling humans. As they work together, the two fall deeply in love with each other. Despite their initial success enslaving Akiko Kusatsu, repeated failures with the Type-S drug wear heavily upon Manticore. As Kirima Nagi draws close to them with her investigations, Manticore finds itself pushed into a corner. At this point Naoko Kamikishiro stumbles across Manticore and Saotome, looking for Echoes. Manticore kills Kamikishiro and Saotome devises a plan that would free Manticore from its past. He manages to stab Echoes with a mechanical pencil filled with Manticore's poison. Its greatest opponent now weakened, Manticore reveals itself and attacks. About to lose, Echoes transforms himself into light, directing the beam towards Manticore to destroy it. Manticore is saved by Saotome, who is disintegrated. It suffers severe burns to half its body. After losing Saotome, the only tie it had to humanity, it reverted to being a monster. Seeking to use Kei Niitoki as a means to restore itself, Manticore chases her, but is captured by a wire. Boogiepop reveals himself, and tells Shiro Tanaka to shoot an arrow through Manticore's head, finishing it off. :In Boogiepop Phantom, remnants of Manticore survived the pillar of light through the electromagnetic field surrounding the city, though the fragments split in two. One part maintained the basic form of Yurihara, but took on the cloak and hat of Boogiepop to become Boogiepop Phantom; the other took the form of Saotome, and survived as Manticore Phantom. Boogiepop Phantom became aware that it would only exist for a short time and used this time to protect the \\"special children\\", ones who had evolved after Echoes became the pillar of light. It searches for evolved humans and preserves those it finds under the city, until the day when humanity catches up with them. It chooses, however, to avoid significant exchange with Nagi Kirima and Boogiepop. It also sees Manaka as a threat, but when it tries to kill her, Boogiepop intervenes, explaining that she has lost her powers. Manticore Phantom cares only about its own survival and continues to devour people in the city. After meeting Arito Misuzu, Manticore Phantom attempts to use her as a pawn to draw more food to itself. It also uses Kishida Ichirou in a similar manner, though while it revealed itself to Misuzu, Kishida remained unaware of Manticore Phantom and of what it had used his body to do. It then sees a chance to get revenge on Kirima, whom it still sees as an enemy, but Boogiepop Phantom intervenes before Kirima arrives. When made aware of its limited life-span, Manticore Phantom panics and enters the body of Ichirou Kishida, another \\"phantom\\" living through the electromagnetic field, and travels to Akihabara, a place with sufficient electromagnetic activity to maintain its existence. Manticore Phantom hides there for a year, devouring people in Tokyo, but Boogiepop finds it. Boogiepop destroys Kishida and Manticore Phantom with an electromagnetic pulse blast. In Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1, Boogiepop compares Spooky E with Manticore, claiming the Manticore is the stronger. :Manticore demonstrates the stark contrast between a person treated as an object or as a failure, and a person given love.

It began in 1933 as the NSDAP Office for Enlightenment on Population Policy and Racial Welfare (German: Aufklärungsamt für Bevölkerungspolitik und Rassenpflege). By 1935, it had been renamed NSDAP Office of Racial Policy (German: Rassenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP or RPA).Robert Cecil, The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology p. 115. . Dr. Walter Gross remained the RPA's leader until his suicide at the end of the Second World War in April 1945.\\"National Socialist Racial Policy: A Speech to German Women\\" Purpose The main role of the RPA was to oversee the production and maintenance of propaganda regarding the ethnic consciousness of the Nordic Aryan master race.Koonz, p. 106. This was termed \\"enlightenment\\" rather than \\"propaganda\\" by the Nazi authorities, because it was \\"not a call for immediate action but a long-term change in attitude\\".Koonz, p. 110. Dr. Gross did not want people thinking of themselves as individuals but rather as \\"single links in the great chain of life\\". Methods All NSDAP racial information required the approval of Gross' office before publication. The department dealt with all measures concerning the field of population and racial policies in cooperation with other Nazi and SS agencies, such as the RKFDV. The RPA checked and passed all Nazi Party press releases on issues of race. It also provided input for drafting Nazi legislation regarding racial issue. The RPA produced Neues Volk, a monthly magazine aimed at a general readership rather than towards a specialist audience.\\"Neues Volk\\"Koonz, p. 117. But while containing articles on topics such as travel tips, its central theme was the promotion of eugenics and ethnic consciousness.Koonz, p. 117-9. Other publications created by the office included a ten-point plan to marriage. The guidelines, rather than focusing on love, stressed the ideal criteria for marriage in the Nazi state was the consideration of race and health. The pamphlet urged investigation of the ancestry of potential mates, and that the hereditary fit should not remain single, concluding with the injunction to hope for many children.Richard Overy, The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia, p247 Other works included \\"Can You Think Racially?\\" and \\"Peasantry between Yesterday and Today\\". The RPA also created traveling exhibitions that presented the ideal Aryan type as unchanging in contrast to subhuman types.Koonz, p. 122. In its first year, the office had published 14 pamphlets for racial education.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p. 116. . This led to the establishment of intensive training courses to create ethnic educators. More than a thousand Sturmabteilung personnel and recent medical school graduates were indoctrinated each year on Nazi racial topics until 1945.Claudia, p. 123.

This growth formation can be referred to as the \\"over-easy formation\\" SH-SY5Y is a human derived cell line used in scientific research. The original cell line, called SK-N-SH, from which it was subcloned was isolated from a bone marrow biopsy taken from a four-year-old female with neuroblastoma. SH-SY5Y cells are often used as in vitro models of neuronal function and differentiation. They are adrenergic in phenotype but also express dopaminergic markers and, as such, have been used to study Parkinson's disease, neurogenesis, and other characteristics of brain cells. History SH-SY5Y was cloned from a bone marrow biopsy derived line called SK-N-SH and first reported in 1973. A neuroblast-like subclone of SK-N- SH, named SH-SY, was subcloned as SH-SY5, which was subcloned a third time to produce the SH-SY5Y line, first described in 1978. The cloning process involved the selection of individual cells or clusters expressing neuron-like characteristics. The SH-SY5Y line is genetically female with two X and no Y chromosome, as expected given the origin from a four-year-old female. Morphology The cells typically grow in tissue culture in two distinct ways. Some grow into clumps of cells which float in the media, while others form clumps which stick to the dish. SH-SY5Y cells can spontaneously interconvert between two phenotypes in vitro, the neuroblast-like cells and the Epithelial like cells, although the mechanisms underlying this process are not understood. However, the cell line is appreciated to be N-type (neuronal), given its morphology and the ability to differentiate the cells into along the neuronal lineage (in contrast to the S-type SH-EP subcloned cell line, also derived from SK-N-SH). Cells with short spiny neurite-like processes migrate out from these adherent clumps. SH-SY5Y cells possess an abnormal chromosome 1, where there is an additional copy of a 1q segment and is referred to trisomy 1q. SH-SY5Y cells are known to be dopamine beta hydroxylase active, acetylcholinergic, glutamatergic and adenosinergic. The cells have very different growth phases, outlined in the surrounding pictures. The cells both propagate via mitosis and differentiate by extending neurites to the surrounding area. While dividing, the aggregated cells can look so different from the differentiated cells following the K'annul-index tumor cellularity (TNF, for Tumor Necrosis Factor), that new scientists often mistake one or the other for contamination. The dividing cells can form clusters of cells which are reminders of their cancerous nature, but certain treatments such as retinoic acid, BDNF, or TPA can force the cells to dendrify and differentiate. Moreover, induction by retinoic acid results in inhibition of cell growth and enhanced production of noradrenaline from SH-SY5Y cells The SH-SY5Y cells are dense and considered to be confluent at this stage. Neuritic growth is more pronounced on the lower part of the photo Media and Cultivation The most common growing cocktail used is a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 medium and 10% supplemental fetal bovine serum. The DMEM usually contains 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids. The cells are always grown at 37 degrees Celsius with 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide. It is advised to cultivate the cells in flasks which are coated for cell culture adhesion, this will aid in differention and dendrification of the neuroblastoma. In general the cells are quite robust and will grow in most widely used tissue culture media. However, it has been recently established that DMEM is superior to DMEM:F12 for propagation of SH- SY5Y. SH-SY5Y has a dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity and can convert dopamine to norepinephrine. It will also form tumors in nude mice in around 3–4 weeks. The loss of neuronal characteristics has been described with increasing passage numbers. Therefore, it is recommended not to be used after passage 20 or verify specific characteristics such as noradrenalin uptake or neuronal tumor markers.

He was the father of Curt \\"Mr. Perfect\\" Hennig, and the grandfather of Joe \\"Curtis Axel\\" Hennig and Amy \\"Ms. Perfect\\" Hennig. He worked in the American Wrestling Association, National Wrestling Alliance, and the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Hennig was known by the nickname, \\"The Axe\\", a nickname he had because of his signature, often finishing move of dropping a full weight elbow onto his prone opponents. Professional wrestling career =American Wrestling Association= In the early 1960s, Hennig entered the American Wrestling Association (AWA) under the tutelage of Verne Gagne. He eventually found some main event success and shared a brief Tag Team Championship reign with Duke Hoffman. But in frequently losing to rougher, more experienced wrestlers, he began questioning the scientific style instilled into him by Gagne and looked toward a different approach (in kayfabe). During the summer of 1963, Hennig left the AWA for a stint in the Texas territories. While touring Texas, Hennig adopted a more brutal style and won the Texas Heavyweight Title. He also crossed paths with Harley Race. The two young wrestlers struck up a friendship and following their mutual commitment in Amarillo, a new tag team broke out into the Minneapolis wrestling scene. Race and Hennig branded themselves as \\"Handsome\\" Harley Race and \\"Pretty Boy\\" Larry Hennig, a cocky villainous tag team with a penchant for breaking the rules to win matches. They quickly became top contenders, and on January 30, 1965, they defeated the tandem of Dick the Bruiser and The Crusher to capture the AWA World Tag Team Championship, becoming, at the time, the youngest tag team champions ever. Race and Hennig continued to feud with the Bruiser and Crusher and other top teams for the next several years, amassing three title reigns. Verne Gagne, in particular, was a hated rival of the team and recruited many different partners to try to defeat Race and Hennig during their AWA run. Gagne and Crusher won the titles from them six months after Race and Hennig's first reign but lost them back on August 7, 1965. The team retained the titles until May 1966 when they lost to Bruiser and Crusher. They then embarked on a tour through New Zealand, Japan, and Australia where they became the first Tag Team Champions of Australia's World Championship Wrestling in June. Just before leaving to Japan, they dropped the titles to Mark Lewin and Dominic DeNucci. Race and Hennig returned to the US in fall of 1966, starting back at the bottom of the competition. As they climbed the ranks all over again, they received a title shot on January 6, 1967 and defeated Bruiser and Crusher in Chicago, Illinois. This would prove to be their final reign at AWA Tag Team Champions. =Knee injury= On November 1, 1967, during a tag team match in Winnipeg, Hennig was in the middle of lifting Johnny Powers as another opponent rammed into him from the front. As he dropped Powers to the mat, Hennig found that his knee had bent inward. Despite severe damage to the cartilage and tendons, he refused to go to the local hospital and instead had Race drive him 500 miles home to Minneapolis. The injury ended their last title run. The AWA allowed Harley Race to select another partner to defend the championship. In March 1968, Hennig returned to once again wrestle alongside Race. After several years at the top of the tag team division, however, Race returned home to Kansas City to pursue a singles career in the National Wrestling Alliance. Hennig was then partnered with Lars Anderson and then \\"Dirty\\" Dusty Rhodes (who was then a heel). In the early 1970s he competed in singles matches working against champions Pedro Morales and Bruno Sammartino. Hennig made a face turn on August 10, 1974 at a TV taping in Minneapolis, now sporting a full red beard and calling himself \\"the Axe\\" when he saved the High Flyers, Jim Brunzell and Greg Gagne, from an attack. The event had Hennig opposing his former allies, Nick Bockwinkel and Ray Stevens, and manager Bobby Heenan (who Bockwinkel and Stevens hired following their recent loss of the AWA World Tag Team title to The Crusher and Billy Robinson the previous month) as they assaulted the Flyers during an episode of AWA All-Star Wrestling. During this time, Hennig also appeared in the independent film, The Wrestler, where he faced Verne Gagne at the Cow Palace in the opening match. In 1976, Hennig formed a team with Joe LeDuc. =Return to AWA= When Harley Race returned to the AWA in 1984, he wrestled Hennig's son, Curt - a match that was fueled by Larry Hennig's confronting his former tag team partner at the end of the match. The following year, Curt's first major push would be alongside his father in a feud with The Road Warriors. Before Larry's retirement in 1985, however, the Hennigs won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship. Hennig also traveled to New York City to unsuccessfully challenge Bruno Sammartino for his WWF World Heavyweight Championship title. Personal life A Domino's Pizza in Newton, Iowa features Larry Hennig on July 15, 2006 Before pursuing a career in professional wrestling, Hennig became the Minnesota State High School Heavyweight Champion from Robbinsdale, Minnesota in 1954. He was awarded a scholarship from the University of Minnesota to wrestle and play football but had to quit due to the priorities of family and raising children. He had five children, including professional wrestler Curt Hennig. Curt died on February 10, 2003 of an acute cocaine intoxication. After the highly publicized death of Chris Benoit, Hennig shared a few words with USA Today regarding premature deaths in professional wrestling. Hennig was also known for his completion of the 1966 and 1967 I-500 snowmobile race, from Winnipeg, Manitoba to St. Paul, Minnesota. He is most notably remembered from the 1966 race in which he drove through a chicken coop. However, this did not prevent him from successfully completing the 500 mile race. =Post-retirement= Following Hennig's retirement from professional wrestling, he and his wife became owners of a real estate company in St. Cloud, Minnesota. He had sold real estate since 1957 and also worked as an auctioneer. He also dabbled in Commodity Futures, specifically CME Dairy.Larry Hennig - 2006 Hall of Fame Inductee WrestlingMuseum.org.

They are typically made from cork (bark of the cork oak), though synthetic materials can be used. Common alternative wine closures include screw caps and glass stoppers. 68 percent of all cork is produced for wine bottle stoppers. Corks are manufactured for still wines as well as sparkling wines; the latter are bottled under pressure, forcing the corks to take on a mushroom shape. They are fastened with a wire cage known as a muselet. History Synthetic corks As late as the mid-17th century, French vintners did not use cork stoppers, using instead oil-soaked rags stuffed into the necks of bottles.Prlewe, J. Wine From Grape to Glass. New York: Abbeville Press, 1999, p. 110. The inventor of cork-based wine stoppers is unknown. Colloquial stories attribute the Benedictine monk Dom Pérignon. The stoppers date to about the 1600s. In the early 21st century, the problem of cork taint became prevalent, leading many producers to stop using corks in favor of alternatives. Screw caps became especially prominent in Australia and New Zealand by 2010. Most cork was sourced from around the Mediterranean Basin, far from the Oceanian countries. Following issues with cork taint, the cork industry invested in new techniques and equipment, reducing TCA chemicals in wine by 95 percent. Cork producers began promoting the cork's environmental and economic benefits. Production Manual corking machine, manufactured c. 1870 Like other cork products, natural wine corks are derived from the bark of cork oak trees. The bark is carefully peeled away and cut into sheets before processing. The oak trees are not cut down, and only about half of its bark is removed at any time. Cork oaks are first harvested at 25 years old, and take place every 9 years. After the third harvest, the bark is of sufficient quality for producing wine corks. Portugal is the largest producer of corks, at 52.5 percent, followed by Spain, Italy, and Algeria. The majority of Portugal's production is in the region of Alentejo, at 72 percent of national production. 68 percent of all cork is produced for wine bottle stoppers. =Products= Corks can be made in several ways: * Natural cork stoppers are made from a single piece of bark, and have the best flexibility, keeping the seal strong for aging wine for over 5 years. * Colmated corks are made from a single piece of bark, but have pores filled with glue and cork dust. They are easier to remove from a bottle, and are good for medium aging. * Multi-piece corks have two or more pieces glued together. They are denser than single- piece corks, and are not good for prolonged aging. * Agglomerated corks are made of cork dust and glue, and are dense, inexpensive, and not good for sealing wine for over a year. * Technical corks are agglomerated corks with single pieces of cork on either end. Attributes Cork stoppers are moisture-resistant, are slow to deteriorate, they help wine age, and provide a waterproof seal. The stoppers are associated with a perception of high quality wine, especially as cheaper alternatives are common with lower-cost wine. Because of the cellular structure of cork, it is easily compressed upon insertion into a bottle and will expand to form a tight seal. The interior diameter of the neck of glass bottles tends to be inconsistent, making this ability to seal through variable contraction and expansion an important attribute. However, unavoidable natural flaws, channels, and cracks in the bark make the cork itself highly inconsistent. In a 2005 closure study, 45% of corks showed gas leakage during pressure testing both from the sides of the cork as well as through the cork body itself. A study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and commissioned by the major cork manufacturer Amorim concluded that cork is the most environmentally responsible stopper, in a one- year life cycle analysis comparison with plastic stoppers and aluminum screw caps. =Reuse= Christmas decor from repurposed corks While many synthetic corks can be at home, natural corks can either be composted or recycled at specific stores. Companies partner with stores to accept used corks and recycle them into other products; ReCork is the largest of these companies in the United States.https://www.bustle.com/p/can-you-recycle-wine-corks-heres- how-you-can-best-dispose-of-them-18010016 Corks are also popularly reused in arts and crafts. Types =Still wine= Corks typically are in diameter. Lengths vary, usually based on length of time estimated to age the wine. Simple wines are commonly long, medium aging wines (the most popular size) are , and long aging or expensive wines are often long. =Sparkling wine= Cork and muselet on a bottle of Franciacorta Sparkling wine corks are typically in diameter and in length. When pushed into the bottle, the corks are compressed to about 60–70 percent of their original diameters. The corks are held in place by wire cages known as muselets. Sparkling wine corks are mostly built from three sections and are referred to as agglomerated corks. The mushroom shape that occurs in the transition is a result of the bottom section's being composed of two stacked discs of pristine cork cemented to the upper portion, which is a conglomerate of ground cork and glue. The bottom section is in contact with the wine. Before insertion, a sparkling wine cork is almost 50% larger than the opening of the bottle. Originally, the cork starts as a cylinder and is compressed before insertion into the bottle. Over time, their compressed shape becomes more permanent and the distinctive \\"mushroom\\" shape becomes more apparent.

Many people of the Rabiah Tribe of Yamamah were greatly hostile to Muhammad and the tribe of Quraish, so in an exchange between a man of the Rabiah tribe and Musaylimah, one man said: :\\"...a liar of the Rabi'ah tribe of Yamamah is better than a truthful person of the Mazar tribe of the Hijaz\\"1 Ibn an-Nawwahah went to Muhammad with a message from Musaylimah consisting of Musaylimah's idea that the world should be split between himself and Muhammad, as they were both prophets of Allah. Muhammad retorted that the division of the world is for Allah to decide. In an exchange between an-Nawwahah and some other messengers of Musaylimah recorded in Sunan Abu Dawood 14:2755: :I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say when he read the letter of Musaylimah: What do you believe yourselves? They said: We believe as he believes. He said: I swear by Allah that were it not that messengers are not killed, I would cut off your heads. Muhammad couldn't kill them because they were diplomatic emissaries, but this statement made by him would stick in the minds of some Muslims. Ultimately Ibn an-Nawwahah's life still ended by the sword of a Muslim, namely Qarazah ibn Ka'b as recorded in Sunan Abu Dawood 14:2756: :Harithah ibn Mudarrib said that he came to Abdullah ibn Mas'ud and said (to him): There is no enmity between me and any of the Arabs. I passed a mosque of Banu Hanifah. They (the people) believed in Musaylimah. Abdullah (ibn Mas'ud) sent for them. They were brought, and he asked them to repent, except Ibn an-Nawwahah. He said to him: I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: Were it not that you were not a messenger, I would behead you. But today you are not a messenger. He then ordered Qarazah ibn Ka'b (to kill him). He beheaded him in the market. Anyone who wants to see Ibn an-Nawwahah slain in the market (he may see him). It isn't completely settled whether Ibn an-Nawwahah was the only messenger or if other followers of Musaylimah had accompanied him, but it is more likely that an-Nawwahah was the only such messenger.

A shooting guard born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Jackson played at Georgetown University from 1985 to 1989 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in finance. He was never drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA) but played 13 seasons for multiple teams. He is best known for his tenure with the San Antonio Spurs, who he helped win their first NBA championship in 1999. NBA career =Traveling swingman (1989–1997)= Upon graduating, Jackson was not drafted, but was first signed as a free agent by the New Jersey Nets in 1989. That year he played in only 28 games, and the following season would play in the Continental Basketball Association and the World Basketball League. He had a very short stint with the Golden State Warriors before signing with the Los Angeles Clippers for whom he played just 34 games in the 1992–93 season. The following year, he was signed and played just 29 games for the Portland Trail Blazers, but he was waived by Portland and picked up by the Philadelphia 76ers, where he started his first NBA game on December 17, 1994. Jackson would again be waived and wouldn't return to action until the following year for another very short stint with the Houston Rockets before being signed by the Washington Bullets prior to the 1996–97 season. It was with the Bullets that Jackson played his longest NBA season, as he played in 75 games for the season as backup to Calbert Cheaney, with an average of 5 points a game and a career- high 53 three-point field goals. =San Antonio Spurs (1997–2001)= In the offseason, following a playoff loss to the eventual champion Chicago Bulls, Jackson signed with the San Antonio Spurs, who had suffered a lottery season the previous year but featured superstar David Robinson and the first pick in the 1997 draft, Tim Duncan. The 1997–98 season would prove to be a personal best for Jackson, as he started in 45 of 82 games and averaged a career-high 8.8 points a game and a new career high of 112 three-pointers for the year. Jackson also saw his most significant playoff action, as the Spurs won in the first round of the playoffs before losing in the conference semifinals. Jackson started in 8 of 9 playoff games and increased his scoring average to 10.2 points for the postseason. The following year would be shortened to 50 games as a result of a league lockout, but the Spurs would continue to use Jackson as its main back up shooting guard behind veteran Mario Elie. Jackson would play in 47 games, starting in 13 and averaged 6.4 points a game. The Spurs would win the number one seed in the playoffs led by Robinson and Duncan, and open the playoffs with a 3–1 first-round win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, before dominating and sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers in 4 games of the conference semifinals. Against the Lakers Jackson played well, scoring 22 points in game 3 followed by 20 points in game 4 to close the series in which he hit 6 three-point shots. The Spurs would next faced Portland in the conference finals, but were once again dominant, with teammate Sean Elliott hitting a crucial three-point shot to win game 2 and Jackson scoring 19 points in game 3. The Spurs completed another sweep, and would face the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals. Jackson scored 17 points in his first Finals game, and the Spurs would win both games in San Antonio before heading to New York. Despite a win by the Knicks at home in game 3, the Spurs proved simply too dominating, and would win the next two games in Madison Square Garden to win the series and the NBA Championship. Jackson scored 11 points in the title clinching 5th game, and averaged 8.2 points throughout the title run. Jackson would once again serve as the main backup at shooting guard for the defending champion Spurs the following season, playing in 81 games and starting in 12. The Spurs would end up losing in the first round of the playoffs to the Phoenix Suns mostly due to a season-ending injury to Duncan, and Jackson only played two games in the series. In the 2000–01 season, the Spurs won the best record in the league before losing in the conference finals, but Jackson only played in 16 games for the season and did not play in the postseason as the team had brought in younger guards such as Derek Anderson. =Retirement= Jackson was signed to play for the Orlando Magic for the latter portion of the 2001–02 season, and played in 9 regular season games and 3 playoff games before retiring. Coaching career Since retiring as a player, Jackson has held several basketball coaching positions at both the college and minor league level. He has been the head coach of the Saint John Millrats of the National Basketball League of Canada. Jackson was named the head coach of the National Basketball League of Canada's Ottawa SkyHawks on November 25, 2013. Personal life Jackson married fellow Hoya Terri Carmichael Jackson, the director of operations at the Women's National Basketball Players Association. They are the parents of Jaren Jackson Jr., who played college basketball for Michigan State before getting drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA.

Chrysler Canada Ltd. is generally thought to be the first case to clearly acknowledge the existence in Canada of a tort of appropriation of personality. Background Bob Krouse was a well-known professional football player with the Hamilton Tiger-cats who played as the number 14. Grant Advertising was an advertising firm whose clients included Chrysler Canada. In 1969, Grant had produced an advertising scheme for Chrysler which included a cardboard scorecard that was distributed to the public. The scorecard was known as the \\"Plymouth Pro Football Spotter\\" which allowed football fans to track scores. On the Spotter was an image of Krouse from behind with his number 14 clearly visible. Krouse sued Chrysler for use of his image without his consent. The judgment below The claim that was presented was considered to consist of five distinct elements: ::(i) invasion of privacy per se; ::(ii) appropriation of the plaintiff 's identity for commercial purposes; ::(iii) breach of confidence; ::(iv) breach of contract; and ::(v) unjust enrichment. In his opinion, Haines J. considered the first claim to be novel in principle, and accordingly declined to rule on it. The third and fourth claims were also dismissed. He then proceeded to what he regarded as the ‘guts’ of the case: the claim that ‘the plaintiff [had] become identified with the products of the defendants and ...had ...his chances of advertising for other automobile manufacturers seriously affected’. Such a claim raised three key issues of fact and law: :*whether the plaintiff had a ‘saleable product advertising ability’; :*whether such an ability was a property right protected by law; and :*whether the defendant's poster was an appropriation of such a right. The first question was answered in the affirmative, and it was found that the second question could also be answered affirmatively, based on two ‘separate but closely related lines of cases’: passing off, and the right of an individual to the elements of his identity. In his opinion, Haines J. found that Krouse did have a right to protect the commercial advertising power in his image. Along with marketing his athletic ability, Krouse also marketed his reputation and image. Both were a product of his work and effort, and so he should be entitled to protect it. As was noted in the opinion: In examining the Spotter, the Court found that Chrysler was attempting to take advantage of Krouse's image to increase sales. Krouse was clearly identifiable within the picture and was the centre of focus. The Court found, however, that Krouse was unable to show that his ability to market his image was harmed, and he was granted $1,000 for general damages. At the Court of Appeal The defendants appealed, arguing that there was no valid cause of action, since the use of the plaintiff's image was not libellous, and since there was an absence of a common field of activity on which to found an action in passing off. The Ontario Court of Appeal found for the defendants on the passing off claim, by maintaining the need to show a common field of activity. In a decision written by Estey J.A., it was held that while Canadian law may contemplate a tort of appropriation of personality, the elements of that cause of action were not made out in this case. Estey, J.A. did not categorically dismiss the possibility of a tort that could broadly be read to encompass an individual's right to control how his or her personality is used: The Court of Appeal did not elaborate on, or depart from, Haines J's analysis of the law at first instance. Aftermath The case was unique in that relatively little weight was placed on the need for formal authority. What was more important were the underlying reasons of substance, particularly the apparent commercial reality that a person's image had a de facto value and was effectively traded as a commodity. The new tort of appropriation of personality did not develop through a gradual extension of an existing cause of action, such as passing off or libel, until it formed a separate and autonomous cause of action, but rather through one bold judicial stroke at first instance.

He was born in 255 BC in Qi, an ancient Chinese state, and died between 195 and 155 BC. He served as a court sorcerer in Qin Dynasty China. Later, he was sent by Qin Shi Huang to the eastern seas twice to look for the elixir of life.Lee, Khoon Choy Lee. Choy, Lee K. [1995] (1995). Japanbetween Myth and Reality: Between Myth and Reality. World Scientific publishing. , . His two journeys occurred between 219 BC and 210 BC. It was believed that the fleet included 60 barques with soldiers, ship crewmen, and 3,000 boys and 3,000 girls, and craftsmen of different fields. After he embarked on a second mission in 210 BC, he never returned.Liu, Hong. The Chinese Overseas: Routledge Library of Modern China. Published by Taylor & Francis, [2006] (2006). , 9780415338592. Voyage The expedition in search of the medicine for immortality. The ruler of Qin Dynasty, Qin Shi Huang, feared death and sought a way to live forever. He entrusted Xu Fu with the task of finding the secret elixir of immortality. In 219 BC, Xu Fu was sent with three thousand virgin boys and girls to retrieve the elixir of life from the immortals on the Mount Penglai, including Anqi Sheng, who was purportedly a magician who was already a thousand years old. Xu sailed for several years without finding the mountain. In 210 BC, when Qin Shi Huang questioned him, Xu Fu claimed there was a giant sea creature blocking the path, and asked for archers to kill the creature. Qin Shi Huang agreed, and sent archers to kill a giant fish. Xu then set sail again, but he never returned from this trip. The Records of the Grand Historian says he came to a place with \\"flat plains and wide swamps\\" (平原廣澤) and proclaimed himself king, never to return. Later historical texts were also unclear on the location of Xu's final destination. Records of the Three Kingdoms and Book of the Later Han, and Guadi Zhi all state that he landed in \\"Danzhou\\" (亶州), but the whereabouts of Danzhou are unknown. Finally, more than 1,100 years after Xu Fu's final voyage, monk Yichu wrote during the Later Zhou (AD 951-960) of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period that Xu Fu landed in Japan, and also said Xu Fu named Mount Fuji as Penglai. This is the \\"Legend of Xu Fu\\" in Japan as evidenced by the many memorials to him there. Legacy Some ancient scholars credited Xu Fu for being the founding father, and catalyst of the development of ancient Japanese society. Jōmon culture which had existed in ancient Japan for over 6,000 years suddenly disappeared around 300 BC. The farming techniques and knowledge that Xu brought along are said to have improved the quality of life of the ancient Japanese people and Xu Fu is said to have introduced many new plants and techniques to ancient Japan, albeit all the existing texts are mainly in Kanji text that now cannot be read by the present day Japanese. The worship of Xu Fu as the \\"God of farming\\", \\"God of medicine\\" and \\"God of silk\\" by the Japanese is attributed to these achievements. Numerous temples and memorials of Xu can be found in many places in Japan. In Xuzhou, there is a Xu Fu Research Institute attached to Xuzhou Teachers College. The Japanese historian Ino Okifu identifies Emperor Jimmu of Japan with Xu Fu.Liu, Hong. The Chinese Overseas: Routledge Library of Modern China. Published by Taylor & Francis, [2006] (2006). . After his arrival the Yayoi period started.Lee, Khoon Choy Lee. Choy, Lee K. [1995] (1995). Japan between Myth and Reality: Between Myth and Reality. World Scientific publishing. . The fictional character Xu Fu, who appears in comics published by Marvel Comics, is based on him. Frank Zhang, one of the central characters of Rick Riordan's The Heroes of Olympus series, is mentioned as being a descendant of Xu Fu. Jofuku Park in Shingu, Wakayama Prefecture is dedicated to him. = Legacy in Japan = According to the tradition of Saga City, Saga Prefecture, Xu Fu came to the Ariake Sea, he decided to float a cup in the water and go ashore where it made landfall. As such, the place where the cup landed is known as \\"Bubai\\", which literally means \\"floating cup\\". Xu Fu reached the top of Mount Kinryu, where he met a hermit and obtained the elixir of immortal life. The name of this elixir is Furofuki, and it still grows on Mount Kinryu today. By the way, the name \\"Furofuki\\" is said to come from the word \\"Furofushi\\", which means \\"not to grow old, not to die\\" in Japanese. In October 2008, the Saga-Xu Fu International Symposium was held in the city of Saga. Many researchers from Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea participated and made presentations.

The road was opened to traffic on May 4, 2001, six months ahead of schedule. There is speculation that it could become part of Interstate 73 in the future. The road largely meets Interstate Highway standards, but in order to support increased Interstate traffic, its shoulders would need to be expanded to standard width. Route Description History In 1994, the original contract with Fluor Daniel called for six lanes from US 17 to SC 905 and four lanes the rest of the way to US 501\\\\. This money depended on a one-cent sales tax devoted to road funding, but voters turned that down.Zane Wilson, \\"DOT commits $95 million for Conway Bypass lanes,\\" The Sun News, February 25, 1999. A bridge was built over the Intracoastal Waterway near Briarcliffe Acres, but it remained the \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\" for three years because there was no money to build the road. In February 1999, the South Carolina Senate passed a bill naming the bridge for Billy Alford, state highway commissioner from 1990 to 1994 and commission chair in 1993.Zane Wilson, \\"Bridge to Nowhere to Get Name,\\" The Sun News, February 22, 1999. On February 24, 1999, the South Carolina Department of Transportation Commission approved $95 million to make the bypass four lanes. Two years earlier, since money was short, the bypass had been reduced to two lanes beyond SC 90, though the $291.3 million project had six lanes to SC 31\\\\. Even with the changes, the road would end up being cheaper than planned because of narrower shoulders and bridges, and more bridges over wetlands. On March 4, 1999, The Joint Bond Review Committee approved selling bonds for the money approved in February. Widening the bridges was considered, since some believed that the road could need six lanes in only a few years.Zane Wilson, \\"South Carolina Approves Bond Sale to Pay for Conway Bypass,\\" The Sun News, March 5, 1999. In June 2000, the first section of the Conway Bypass opened 17 months sooner than expected despite flooding from Hurricane Floyd. In November 2000, the section from SC 90 to SC 905, including a 29-foot-high bridge over the Waccamaw River, opened 13 months sooner than planned. The final section opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony in May 2001. In 2003, the South Carolina General Assembly approved a resolution asking that the Conway Bypass be designated I-73. Future South Carolina Highway 22 is slated to be upgraded to Interstate standards and eventually become the southernmost terminus of Interstate 73. Interstate 73 will begin where SC 22 starts at US 17 near Briarcliffe Acres. It will then proceed northwest crossing the proposed routing of Interstate 74 (currently SC 31, the Carolina Bays Parkway). After passing Conway, Interstate 73 will leave SC 22 at a new interchange to be constructed west of US 701, and will then use a new highway to be built between SC 22 and SC 917 north of Cool Spring. The \\"I-73 Intermediate Traffic and Revenue Study\\" by C&M; Associates, dated February 2016, was to be presented to state transportation officials March 24, 2016. It included upgrades to SC 22\\\\. RIDE III, if approved by voters, would also provide funding for the Southern Evacuation Lifeline. The current interchange that serves as the western terminus of SC 22 with U.S. 501 is slated to be the starting point for the proposed Southern Evacuation Lifeline, a proposed limited-access highway which would allow a more direct route west from the southern Strand, while simultaneously, along with SC 22, completing a beltway around the Myrtle Beach area.

Madras, India, 13 August 1927; d. Hartford, Connecticut, United States, 10 September 2002) was a Carnatic musician specializing in the Carnatic flute and voice. Early life and background Viswa, as T. (Tanjore/Thanjavur) Viswanathan is often called, was the grandson of the legendary Veena Dhanammal, considered one of the greatest players of Veena, the South Indian lute. Viswa's sister was T. (Tanjore/Thanjavur) Balasaraswati, the greatest exponent of Bharatanatyam (South Indian classical dance) in the second half of the 20th century. His brother was the mridangam player T. Ranganathan (1925–1987). Though hailing from a highly esteemed musical family, at age eight Viswa sought the tutorship of Tiruppamparam Swaminatha Pillai, one of the innovators of the bamboo flute as an art musical instrument. At the time, Pillai lived in Tanjoor, about 200 miles from Madras, so Viswa left his parents' home to live and study with his teacher. He would practice for four hours a day, both before and after school. After a year, Pillai relocated to Madras, so Viswa returned to his family home but continued to study with Master Pillai for another 20 years. Career Viswa combined the best musical traditions of his family and that of Swaminathan Pillai to play the flute in a uniquely vocal style, doing full justice to the lyric and lilt. In fact Viswa would very often put the flute down in the middle of his concerts and start singing, though he was not a trained voice artist. Viswa was a complete musician. He performed for dance as much as he performed pure music. His repertoire was wide and we may well have heard the last of many of the songs that he used to perform, in particular the songs of Muthuthandavar which were set to music by Swaminathan Pillai, and a host of Padams, Javalis and Tillanas that were the property of the Dhanammal family. He trained a number of students in India and abroad to sing, but just one student, T.R. Moorthy, on the flute. Viswa was largely responsible for putting Jon Higgins on the carnatic stage, who became so popular as to be known as Higgins Bhagavathar among the rasikas of South Indian music. To teach foreign students, Viswa employed complex notations to represent the ornamentation/oscillation that is characteristic to South Indian music. He first came to the United States in 1958 on a Fulbright fellowship, studying ethnomusicology at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1958 to 1960, and later teaching there. He returned to India and was Head of the Department of Music at the University of Madras from 1961 to 1965. He settled in the United States in 1966, and also taught at the California Institute of the Arts. Following the earning of his Ph.D. from Wesleyan University in 1975, he taught at that university for many years. Among his best known students were Anuradha Sriram, T.R. Moorthy, Jon B. Higgins, Douglas Knight and David Nelson. While a majority of South Indian (Carnatic) flautists play with the 8-holed flute fashioned by T.R. Mahalingam (Mali), students of T. Viswanathan play with the 7-hole flute innovated by Swaminatha Pillai. Viswanathan and his brother Ranganathan recorded the music for the Satyajit Ray documentary film Bala (1976), about their sister, the bharatanatyam dancer Balasaraswati. He died of a heart attack on 10 September 2002. He is survived by his wife Josepha Cormack Viswanathan, one daughter (Jayasri), and two sons (Kumar and Kerey). In 2004, Oxford University Press USA published a book co-authored by T. Viswanathan and Matthew Harp Allen, entitled Music in South India: The Karnatak Concert Tradition and Beyond, from the series Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture. Awards and honors Viswanathan received some of the most prestigious awards in India, including Instrumental Musician of the Year (Kalaimamani) from the Government of Tamil Nadu (1978), the President's Award from the Sangeet Natak Akademi (1987), and the Madras Music Academy's Sangeetha Kalanidhi (\\"Treasure of Musical Art\\"), the highest award given to a South Indian musician (1988). In 1992, Viswanathan became the first Indian musician to be awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. Also in 1992, he received a research fellowship from the American Institute of Indian Studies. See also  References External links T Viswanathan page at MusicalNirvana.com site *T.

Brad received several starts at the latter end of the season, against quality opposition such as Melbourne Victory FC and Adelaide United FC, because of this and impressed many of the other players with his versatility, strength and skill. For the 2007-08 A-league season, Mariners' coach Lawrie McKinna made it clear the Mariners would hold onto this quality talent, and that he would be a major part of the campaign, hopefully filling the place vacated by Noel Spencer. In 2010/11, a serious knee injury kept Porter sidelined for the whole season. On 14 October 2007 Porter was sent off after receiving a red card for a sliding tackle. Porter played with the Mariners feeder club and NSW Super League side Central Coast Lightning. On 11 July 2012, Porter announced his retirement due to his inability to overcome long term injury problems. Post-football career In 2013, Porter joined the coaching staff at the International Football School in Kariong, New South Wales http://www.internationalfootballschool.com/about-us/staff/ and took on a First Grade coaching role for Central Coast Premier League team Kanwal Warnervale Rovers Honours With Central Coast Mariners: * A-League Premiership: 2007-2008, 2011-2012 References External links Central Coast Mariners profile * FFA - Olyroo profile Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Gosford Category:Australian soccer players Category:Australia youth international soccer players Category:Australia under-20 international soccer players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Central Coast Mariners FC players Category:A-League players Category:Australian Institute of Sport soccer players ","title":"Brad Porter"},{"id":"5994145","text":"Location of Tong Fuk Beach within Hong Kong (red arrow) Tong Fuk Beach.

Tong Fuk Beach, to the south of the village, is a local attraction, where visitors rent village houses for leisure. History The original Tong Fuk Tsuen was composed of indigenous inhabitants of Chan (陳) and Tang (鄧) clans who settled in the Wanli (萬曆, 1572-1620) reign of the Ming dynasty. The Chan coming from Sha Lo Wan in North Lantau, whilst the Tang originated from Tuen Mun. Most of the indigenous inhabitants were fishermen and farmers who worshiped Hung Shing, a Chinese folk religion deity. Geography Several rivers and streams run through Tong Fuk, making it suitable for cultivation. The main river runs through the west of the village. Across the main river is Ma Po Ping (). It is sometimes regarded as part of Tong Fuk. South of Ma Po Ping is a bay named Tong Fuk Miu Wan (). Features A Hung Shing Temple is located at the eastern end of Tong Fuk Miu Wan. It was built by the villagers in 1803 and gave its name to the bay. The temple was renovated in 1965.

It can detect and quantify transport and barrier functions of living tissue. The Ussing chamber was invented by the Danish zoologist and physiologist Hans Henriksen Ussing in 1946.The Ussing Pulse project (goto.glocalnet.net) The technique is used to measure the short-circuit current as an indicator of net ion transport taking place across an epithelium. Ussing chambers are used to measure ion transport in native tissue, such as gut mucosa, and in a monolayer of cells grown on permeable supports.  Function  The Ussing chamber provides a system to measure the transport of ions, nutrients, and drugs across various epithelial tissues,A guide to Ussing chamber studies of mouse intestine (Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol. Jun 2009; 296(6): G1151–G1166. Published online Apr 2, 2009.) (although can generate false-negative results for lipophilic substances). It consists of two halves separated by the epithelia (sheet of mucosa or monolayer of epithelial cells grown on permeable supports). Epithelia are polar in nature, i.e., they have an apical or mucosal side and a basolateral or serosal side. An Ussing chamber can isolate the apical side from the basolateral side. The two half chambers are filled with equal amounts of symmetrical Ringer solution to remove chemical, mechanical or electrical driving forces. Ion transport takes place across any epithelium. Transport may be in either direction. Ion transport produces a potential difference (voltage difference) across the epithelium. The voltage is measured using two voltage electrodes placed near the tissue/epithelium. This voltage is cancelled out by injecting current, using two other current electrodes placed away from the epithelium. This short-circuit current (Isc) is the measure of net ion transport. Measuring epithelial ion transport is helped by Ussing chambers. The voltage result from this ion transport is easy to accurately measure. The epithelium pumps ions from one side to the other and the ions leak back through so-called tight junctions that are situated between the epithelial cells. To measure ion transport, an external current is applied. Simply cancelling the voltage underestimates the true value. This is corrected by a short circuit at the voltage measuring electrodes. The resistance between the external voltage electrodes must be considered. The Isc underestimates the ion transport: the error can be as much as 10-fold. The type of chambers suggested by Ussing produces large errors. This error is often estimated by measuring the voltage without tissue present, leading to uncertain values. Better methods involve using alternating current in the form of sinuous-shaped current using several frequencies, square wave pulses, sharp impulses and random noise.

It provides an upper limit on the efficiency that any classical thermodynamic engine can achieve during the conversion of heat into work, or conversely, the efficiency of a refrigeration system in creating a temperature difference by the application of work to the system. It is not an actual thermodynamic cycle but is a theoretical construct. Every single thermodynamic system exists in a particular state. When a system is taken through a series of different states and finally returned to its initial state, a thermodynamic cycle is said to have occurred. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, for example by moving a piston, thereby acting as a heat engine. A system undergoing a Carnot cycle is called a Carnot heat engine, although such a \\"perfect\\" engine is only a theoretical construct and cannot be built in practice. However, a microscopic Carnot heat engine has been designed and run. Essentially, there are two \\"heat reservoirs\\" forming part of the heat engine at temperatures Th and Tc (hot and cold respectively). They have such large thermal capacity that their temperatures are practically unaffected by a single cycle. Since the cycle is theoretically reversible, there is no generation of entropy during the cycle; entropy is conserved. During the cycle, an arbitrary amount of entropy ΔS is extracted from the hot reservoir, and deposited in the cold reservoir. Since there is no volume change in either reservoir, they do no work, and during the cycle, an amount of energy ThΔS is extracted from the hot reservoir and a smaller amount of energy TcΔS is deposited in the cold reservoir. The difference in the two energies (Th-Tc)ΔS is equal to the work done by the engine. Stages The Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps: : A Carnot cycle illustrated on a PV diagram to illustrate the work done. In this case, :\\\\Delta S_1 = \\\\Delta S_2 , or, : Q_1/T_h = Q_2/T_c. This is true as Q_2 and T_c are both lower and in fact are in the same ratio as Q_1/T_h . = The pressure–volume graph = When the Carnot cycle is plotted on a pressure–volume diagram (), the isothermal stages follow the isotherm lines for the working fluid, the adiabatic stages move between isotherms, and the area bounded by the complete cycle path represents the total work that can be done during one cycle. From point 1 to 2 and point 3 to 4 the temperature is constant. Heat transfer from point 4 to 1 and point 2 to 3 are equal to zero. Properties and significance = The temperature–entropy diagram = : A Carnot cycle acting as a heat engine, illustrated on a temperature–entropy diagram. The cycle takes place between a hot reservoir at temperature TH and a cold reservoir at temperature TC. The vertical axis is temperature, the horizontal axis is entropy. : A generalized thermodynamic cycle taking place between a hot reservoir at temperature TH and a cold reservoir at temperature TC. By the second law of thermodynamics, the cycle cannot extend outside the temperature band from TC to TH. The area in red QC is the amount of energy exchanged between the system and the cold reservoir. The area in white W is the amount of work energy exchanged by the system with its surroundings. The amount of heat exchanged with the hot reservoir is the sum of the two. If the system is behaving as an engine, the process moves clockwise around the loop, and moves counter-clockwise if it is behaving as a refrigerator. The efficiency to the cycle is the ratio of the white area (work) divided by the sum of the white and red areas (heat absorbed from the hot reservoir). The behaviour of a Carnot engine or refrigerator is best understood by using a temperature–entropy diagram (T–S diagram), in which the thermodynamic state is specified by a point on a graph with entropy (S) as the horizontal axis and temperature (T) as the vertical axis (). For a simple closed system (control mass analysis), any point on the graph will represent a particular state of the system. A thermodynamic process will consist of a curve connecting an initial state (A) and a final state (B). The area under the curve will be: which is the amount of thermal energy transferred in the process. If the process moves to greater entropy, the area under the curve will be the amount of heat absorbed by the system in that process. If the process moves towards lesser entropy, it will be the amount of heat removed. For any cyclic process, there will be an upper portion of the cycle and a lower portion. For a clockwise cycle, the area under the upper portion will be the thermal energy absorbed during the cycle, while the area under the lower portion will be the thermal energy removed during the cycle. The area inside the cycle will then be the difference between the two, but since the internal energy of the system must have returned to its initial value, this difference must be the amount of work done by the system over the cycle. Referring to , mathematically, for a reversible process we may write the amount of work done over a cyclic process as: Since dU is an exact differential, its integral over any closed loop is zero and it follows that the area inside the loop on a T–S diagram is equal to the total work performed if the loop is traversed in a clockwise direction, and is equal to the total work done on the system as the loop is traversed in a counterclockwise direction. : A Carnot cycle taking place between a hot reservoir at temperature TH and a cold reservoir at temperature TC. = The Carnot cycle = : A visualization of the Carnot cycle Evaluation of the above integral is particularly simple for the Carnot cycle. The amount of energy transferred as work is : W = \\\\oint PdV = \\\\oint TdS = (T_H-T_C)(S_B-S_A) The total amount of thermal energy transferred from the hot reservoir to the system will be : Q_H=T_H(S_B-S_A)\\\\, and the total amount of thermal energy transferred from the system to the cold reservoir will be : Q_C=T_C(S_B-S_A)\\\\, The efficiency \\\\eta is defined to be: where : is the work done by the system (energy exiting the system as work), : Q_C is the heat taken from the system (heat energy leaving the system), : Q_H is the heat put into the system (heat energy entering the system), : T_C is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir, and : T_H is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir. : S_B is the maximum system entropy : S_A is the minimum system entropy This definition of efficiency makes sense for a heat engine, since it is the fraction of the heat energy extracted from the hot reservoir and converted to mechanical work. A Rankine cycle is usually the practical approximation. = Reversed Carnot cycle = The Carnot heat-engine cycle described is a totally reversible cycle. That is all the processes that compose it can be reversed, in which case it becomes the Carnot refrigeration cycle. This time, the cycle remains exactly the same except that the directions of any heat and work interactions are reversed. Heat is absorbed from the low-temperature reservoir, heat is rejected to a high-temperature reservoir, and a work input is required to accomplish all this. The P–V diagram of the reversed Carnot cycle is the same as for the Carnot cycle except that the directions of the processes are reversed.Çengel, Yunus A., and Michael A. Boles. Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. p. 299. Print. =Carnot's theorem= It can be seen from the above diagram, that for any cycle operating between temperatures T_H and T_C, none can exceed the efficiency of a Carnot cycle. : A real engine (left) compared to the Carnot cycle (right). The entropy of a real material changes with temperature. This change is indicated by the curve on a T–S diagram. For this figure, the curve indicates a vapor-liquid equilibrium (See Rankine cycle). Irreversible systems and losses of energy (for example, work due to friction and heat losses) prevent the ideal from taking place at every step. Carnot's theorem is a formal statement of this fact: No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between those same reservoirs. Thus, Equation gives the maximum efficiency possible for any engine using the corresponding temperatures. A corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Rearranging the right side of the equation gives what may be a more easily understood form of the equation, namely that the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine equals the difference in temperature between the hot and cold reservoir divided by the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir. Looking at this formula an interesting fact becomes apparent: Lowering the temperature of the cold reservoir will have more effect on the ceiling efficiency of a heat engine than raising the temperature of the hot reservoir by the same amount. In the real world, this may be difficult to achieve since the cold reservoir is often an existing ambient temperature. In other words, maximum efficiency is achieved if and only if no new entropy is created in the cycle, which would be the case if e.g. friction leads to dissipation of work into heat. In that case, the cycle is not reversible and the Clausius theorem becomes an inequality rather than an equality. Otherwise, since entropy is a state function, the required dumping of heat into the environment to dispose of excess entropy leads to a (minimal) reduction in efficiency. So Equation gives the efficiency of any reversible heat engine. In mesoscopic heat engines, work per cycle of operation in general fluctuates due to thermal noise. If the cycle is performed quasi-statically, the fluctuations vanish even on the mesoscale. However, if the cycle is performed faster than the relaxation time of the working medium, the fluctuations of work are inevitable. Nevertheless, when work and heat fluctuations are counted, there is exact equality that relates the exponential average of work performed by any heat engine and the heat transfer from the hotter heat bath. =Efficiency of real heat engines= :See also: Heat engine efficiency and other performance criteria Carnot realized that in reality it is not possible to build a thermodynamically reversible engine, so real heat engines are even less efficient than indicated by Equation 3. In addition, real engines that operate along this cycle are rare. Nevertheless, Equation 3 is extremely useful for determining the maximum efficiency that could ever be expected for a given set of thermal reservoirs. Although Carnot's cycle is an idealisation, the expression of Carnot efficiency is still useful. Consider the average temperatures, : \\\\langle T_H\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta S} \\\\int_{Q_{in}} TdS : \\\\langle T_C\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta S} \\\\int_{Q_{out}} TdS at which heat is input and output, respectively. Replace TH and TC in Equation () by ⟨TH⟩ and ⟨TC⟩ respectively. For the Carnot cycle, or its equivalent, the average value ⟨TH⟩ will equal the highest temperature available, namely TH, and ⟨TC⟩ the lowest, namely TC. For other less efficient cycles, ⟨TH⟩ will be lower than TH, and ⟨TC⟩ will be higher than TC. This can help illustrate, for example, why a reheater or a regenerator can improve the thermal efficiency of steam power plants—and why the thermal efficiency of combined-cycle power plants (which incorporate gas turbines operating at even higher temperatures) exceeds that of conventional steam plants. The first prototype of the diesel engine was based on the Carnot cycle.

In 1997, it was awarded specialist language college status and in 2000 it became a training school. It has been an academy since 2012 and operates as part of The Laurus Trust. History =Early history: 1785–1936= Jonathan Robinson School, 1955 The history of the school dates to 1785, when a local landowner, Jonathan Robinson, gifted 6 acres of land for the purpose of constructing a schoolhouse. The profits from the land were to pay for a schoolmaster and educate children from the local area, including four boys and four girls who would receive a free education. The school was built in 1788 and the first schoolmaster was Thomas Burrows. It was initially an all-age school, where all the children were taught in one room, and due to an increasing population the school was enlarged in 1861. At this time, the school was also used as a place of worship and Sunday school. Due to the increasing population, and the 1870 Education Act which stipulated that every child should be educated, a new school, All Saints National School, was opened close by in 1873. It was to serve as a junior school, and the Jonathan Robinson School became an infant school. In 1908, the school was closed for six months for repairs to the drains and ashpits which had been blamed for recurring illnesses amongst the children. In 1922, houses were built along Woods Lane, and the road was widened. The Trustees of the school were expected to pay half the costs of the new road, including lighting and drainage, but they were unable to afford it. By 1930 it was agreed that instead of payment, the school would transfer to Cheshire County Council, along with the land which would soon be used for the building of a new secondary school. For the time being, the new secondary school was temporarily accommodated approximately 1 mile away, in a building which became Queens Road Primary School, a feeder school to Cheadle Hulme High School. In 2015, this school was closed and demolished, and replaced with a new building as an amalgamation with Orrishmere Primary School. The school opened on 22 October 1932 as Queens Road Senior Council School with a roll of 132 children, and the first headmaster was Major Richard Bell, who had served in the First World War. =Woods Lane Secondary Modern School: 1936–1972= The oldest part of the present-day high school was built in 1935, and officially opened on 28 April 1936. It was designed in the shape of a capital ‘E’ to signify it was a place of education to potential aircraft bombers, with a multi-use school hall and open corridors. Boys and girls were segregated in school, with different entrances and playgrounds. During the Second World War, the school hosted evacuees from several destinations, including Manchester and the Channel Islands, and in 1954 a new headmaster, Mr Richard Haynes, was appointed. In 1962, the original school was demolished, and in 1965, plans were underway to extend the building with the potential of changing to a comprehensive school: a new hall was built, and the old hall was changed into a library; an administrative area, gymnasium, dining rooms, and two-storey block were also built at this time, and the open corridors were closed in. The numbers on roll had now increased to 480. By 1969, Mr David Pennells had been appointed as the new headmaster, and despite some opposition, the school became comprehensive in 1972, changing its name to Cheadle Hulme County High School, and in 1974 with government changes from Cheshire County Council to Stockport Council, Cheadle Hulme High School. There was a significant building programme, including an associated sports centre, so the school could now accommodate up to 1,500 children. =Comprehensive school: 1972–1997= The change to a comprehensive system resulted in the loss of the house system, and replaced with year groups and form tutors. A sixth form had been introduced in 1971, and by 1977 the first fully comprehensive sixth form was in place. 1986 saw the first computer laboratory installed, funded by the PTA, and information technology was gradually introduced throughout the school. In 1989 Mr Ronald Dixon was appointed as headteacher, and in the early 1990s, the sixth form was phased out, with Stockport Council reorganising further education as sixth form colleges. =Language college: 1997–2012= Cheadle Hulme High School, 2006 Cheadle Hulme High School became a specialist language college in September 1997, a status which is unique to it in the borough, and allowing it to assume the name of Cheadle Hulme College. It also became a training school in 2000. The incumbent headteacher, Mrs Linda Magrath was appointed in 2004. In 2005 the school reverted to the name Cheadle Hulme High School to avoid confusion with The Cheadle College in Cheadle Hulme and Marple Sixth Form College in Marple, and a new uniform and logo was introduced. =Laurus Trust: 2012–present= In 2012, the school became an academy, as the lead school in the Laurus Trust, and a teaching school as part of the Altius Alliance. This enabled a sixth form to be reintroduced in 2013, and a sixth form building was opened in 2014. The Trust took over the operation of the sports centre, and rebranded it as Club Cheadle Hulme, which is open to the public in the evenings and weekends. These changes meant there was no longer a use for the gymnasium, which was situated at the opposite end of the school from the other sports facilities. This part of the school was redeveloped into a new entrance area, with new offices and an extension to the sixth form building, completed in March 2018. Buildings and campus The school is situated on Woods Lane in the Smithy Green area of Cheadle Hulme. There are several distinct areas of the complex – from north to south, the sixth form building was opened in 2014, especially for the use of sixth form students, and contains classrooms, a lecture theatre and refectory; the ‘lower school’ contains the hall, administrative areas, classrooms, library and study centre, and outdoor playgrounds (this part of the school dates from the 1930s and 1960s); the upper school contains classrooms, offices, and canteen areas, as well as Club Cheadle Hulme, the sports centre; there are outdoor sports areas, including tennis and netball courts, and an all-weather astro-turf pitch. The Laurus Trust The Laurus Trust is a multi-academy trust founded in 2012, and is based at the school. It supports the school and four other secondary academies; Hazel Grove High School in Hazel Grove, Didsbury High School in West Didsbury, Laurus Cheadle Hulme in Cheadle Hulme and Laurus Ryecroft in Droylsden, and two primary academies Cheadle Hulme Primary School in Cheadle Hulme and Gorsey Bank Primary School in Wilmslow.

The film follows an evil leprechaun, who searches for his magic flute that three hoodlums stole, and kills anyone who gets in his way. It was released direct-to-video on March 28, 2000, and is the last film in the series to be released by Trimark Pictures, which disbanded in 2001. The film was followed by Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood (2003). Plot In Los Angeles, California, Mack Daddy O’Nasses (Ice-T) and Slug (Barima McKnight) discover a room full of gold, along with a leprechaun (Warwick Davis) that has been kept as a statue by a medallion on its neck. Mack Daddy takes a gold flute, but Slug removes the medallion freeing the Leprechaun and is killed, though Mack Daddy traps it once more. 20 years later, wannabe rap artists Postmaster P. (Anthony Montgomery), Stray Bullet (Rashaan Nall) and Butch (Red Grant) have their speaker destroyed while at an audition. After failing to sell a guitar to pawn shop owners Jackie Dee (Dan Martin) and Chow (Jack Ung), Stray Bullet manages to convince Mack Daddy, now a successful record producer, to pick them up. However, he drops them when Postmaster P. refuses to make his music more aggressive. As revenge, the friends break into Mack Daddy's office and steal his magic golden flute, but accidentally frees the Leprechaun. The Leprechaun hunts the friends in order to recover his stolen flute, which places listeners of its tune in a euphoric trance. After killing Reverend Hanson, Jackie Dee & Chow, the DJ artists, and the transvestite Fontaine, the Leprechaun reaches the three friends at Postmaster P.s home. When the boys and the Leprechaun engage in a fight for the flute, the Leprechaun forces Stray Bullet to point his gun at Butch's head threatening to kill him. Postmaster reluctantly complies but Stray Bullet foolishly charges the Leprechaun only to force him to shoot himself in the head while Postmaster P. and Butch watch in horror. Butch visits Postmaster P. at his grandma's house and convinces him to use a joint laced with four-leaf clovers to strip the Leprechaun of his powers in order to steal back the flute. Postmaster P. and Butch then visit the club in which the Leprechaun has taken up residence dressed in drag. Postmaster P. then breaks the Leprechaun's spell on the Zombie Fly Girls by having them smoke one of the clover joints in order to find the Leprechaun. The duo then goes upstairs to find the Leprechaun who wants the dressed-up Postmaster P. to give him a blowjob. Before proceeding any further, the Leprechaun smokes the clover joint and passes out. The boys then take the flute and head downstairs only to be intercepted Mack Daddy who shoots Butch, killing him. Postmaster P. retaliates by shooting Mack Daddy three times. No longer under the effects of clover, the Leprechaun comes downstairs and uses magic to pin Postmaster P. against a girder.

Immediately, the Leprechaun uses magic to explode Mack Daddy's torso, but with the last of his strength, Mack Daddy throws the magic amulet in the air. Cutting to a dark stage with much fog and a silhouetted Postmaster P. rapping about how he's finally made it. He moves to the forefront where his eyes are hidden behind sunglasses. He removes the sunglasses to show that his irises glow a neon green, which indicates that he is under the Leprechaun's spell. The Leprechaun is now a music manager, who took over the music world.

Mythology Tityos was the son of Elara; his father was Zeus. Zeus hid Elara from his wife, Hera, by placing her deep beneath the earth.Scholia on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1.761 citing Pherecydes Tityos grew so large that he split his mother's womb, and he was carried to term by Gaia, the Earth. Once grown, Tityos attempted to rape Leto at the behest of Hera. He was slain by Leto's protective children Artemis and Apollo.Scholia on Pindar, Pythian Odes 4.160 citing Pherecydes As punishment, he was stretched out in Tartarus and tortured by two vultures who fed on his liver, which grew back every night. This punishment is comparable to that of the Titan Prometheus. Jane Ellen Harrison noted that, \\"To the orthodox worshiper of the Olympians he was the vilest of criminals; as such Homer knew him\\": :I saw Tityus too, :son of the mighty Goddess Earthsprawling there :on the ground, spread over nine acrestwo vultures :hunched on either side of him, digging into his liver, :beaking deep in the blood-sac, and he with his frantic hands :could never beat them off, for he had once dragged off :the famous consort of Zeus in all her glory, :Leto, threading her way toward Pytho's ridge :over the lovely dancing-rings of Panopeus\\".Odyssey xi.576-81 (Robert Fagles' translation). Michelangelo, Punishment of Tityus, c. 1532 In the early first century, when the geographer Strabo visited Panopeus (ix.3.423), he was reminded by the local people that it was the abode of Tityos and recalled the fact that the Phaeacians had carried Rhadamanthys in their boats to visit Tityos, according to Homer.Odyssey vii.324. There on Euboea at the time of Strabo they were still showing a \\"cave called Elarion from Elara who was mother to Tityos, and a hero-shrine of Tityos, and some kind of honours are mentioned which are paid him.\\"Quoted in Harrison (1903) 1922, p 336. It is clear that the local hero-cult had been superseded by the cult of the Olympian gods, an Olympian father provided, and the hero demonized. A comparable giant chthonic pre-Olympian of a Titan-like order is Orion. The poet Lucretius restyles the figure of Tityos in book III (lines 978-998) of De rerum natura, a demythologized Tityos who is not in the underworld, eternally punished, but here and now, \\"the prototypical anguished lover\\", plagued by winged creatures that are not vultures, as E.J. Kenney arguesKenney, \\"Tityos and the lover\\", Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society (1970:44-47). but cupids. Virgil responds to Lucretius with a retrospective simile of Tityos in the Aeneid (6.595ff), which compares his torment of desire with the unrest of Dido, whose flame of love is eating her marrow.Colin I. M. Hamilton, \\"Dido, Tityos and Prometheus\\", The Classical Quarterly, New Series, 43.1 (1993:249-254), p. 251f. The traveler Pausanias (2nd century A.D.) reports seeing a painting by Polygnotus at Delphi that depicts Tityos among other figures being tormented in Hades for sacrilege: \\"Tityos too is in the picture; he is no longer being punished, but has been reduced to nothing by continuous torture, an indistinct and mutilated phantom.\\"Pausanias, Descriptions of Greece, 10.29.3: γέγραπται δὲ καὶ Τιτυὸς οὐ κολαζόμενος ἔτι, ἀλλὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ συνεχοῦς τῆς τιμωρίας ἐς ἅπαν ἐξανηλωμένος, ἀμυδρὸν καὶ οὐδὲ ὁλόκληρον εἴδωλον. Tityos had a daughter named Europa who coupled with Poseidon and gave birth to Euphemus, one of the Argonauts. Popular culture Tityos is referenced in Dante Alighieri's Inferno. He is mentioned to be among the biblical and mythological giants that are frozen onto the rings outside of Hell's Circle of Treachery. Dante and Virgil threatened to go to Tityos and Typhon if Antaeus doesn't lower them into the Circle of Treachery. * The Tomb of Tityos is a location in Assassin's Creed Odyssey that features a very large broken statue of Tityos being eaten by vultures.

Born in Dresden, Ontario, the son of Thomas Robert McInnes, McInnes entered the University of Toronto at the age of 14 and graduated in 1889, the youngest graduate to that date. After studying at Osgoode Hall, he was called to the British Columbia Bar in 1893 and practiced law in Nanaimo and Vancouver. A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, McInnes won the federal constituency of Vancouver in 1896 and sat in the House of Commons of Canada in Ottawa. In 1900, he represented Port Alberni in the British Columbia Legislature for five years. In Victoria, he served as provincial secretary and Minister of Education. On May 27, 1905, McInnes was appointed to the office of Commissioner in the Yukon Territory. His term in office was said to be one of reform and stability, in contrast to the term of his predecessor, Frederick Tennyson Congdon. He was said to be one of the most popular politicians in the Yukon in the early 1900s. However, on December 31, 1906, McInnes had resigned and looking to sit once again in the House of Commons. J. T. Lithgow took over as Acting Commissioner until a successor to McInnes could be appointed. McInnes never again sat in the House. He tried in 1908, 1917 and 1921, only to be defeated on all occasions. In 1909, McInnes became a judge when he was appointed to the County Court of Vancouver between 1909 and 1917. He served as police magistrate for ten years, beginning in 1944, and was known for the severity of his sentences. William Wallace Burns McInnes died in Vancouver in 1954.

St Leonards remained an all-girls school until 1999, upon which it became fully co-educational.

In March 2002 it was announced that the prep school would be relocated to the main building and renamed St Leonards Junior and Middle Schools. Following a further announcement in March 2005,St Andrews schools to merge , The Courier, March 2005 St Leonards junior and middle schools merged with New Park School, also located in St Andrews, operating as one unit under the name St Leonards-New Park. In June 2011 it was announced that the junior school would be known in future as St Leonards Junior School. At the same time, work commenced on a £2.5m redevelopment of the junior school. =Lacrosse = The school is believed to be the first place in the world to have played women's lacrosse after it was introduced by Louisa LumsdenHistory of Lacrosse at St Leonards, official website in 1890.  Academics  At St Leonards, year groups are named following the system used in England and Wales (Year 1 to Year 13). Years 1–7 form the Junior School, Years 8–11 the Senior School and Years 12–13 the Sixth Form. The IB’s Primary Years Programme (PYP) is taught from Years 1–6, while the IB’s Middle Years Programme (MYP) is introduced in Year 7 and continues through Year 9. Therefore, the MYP overlaps across the Junior and Senior Schools. In Year 10, pupils begin a two-year course in preparation for their GCSE/IGCSE exams at the end of Year 11. Students are now given a degree of choice as to which subjects they take, however a number remain compulsory: English, Maths, Science and a foreign language. As an alternative to the above for pupils who join the school in Year 11, St Leonards offers a one-year Pre- IB course. These students sit IGCSE exams only. In Years 12–13, St Leonards pupils may undertake one of two programmes: the IB Diploma Programme (DP) or the Pearson BTEC Nationals in either Business or Sport. A large majority choose the DP, with the latter being available for those who would prefer a more vocational qualification. Academic study is still very present for BTEC students alongside the practical aspect, as at St Leonards both BTEC courses are studied with two or three DP courses. The average IB Diploma points score for St Leonards pupils from 2015 to 2019 is 33/45, compared to a global average of 29/45 points for the same period. St Leonards has been recognised as the \\"Top Independent Secondary School Sixth Form in Scotland for IB/A Level Results\\" in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Almost all St Leonards graduates go onto university, and all who apply gain a place. The school claims that approximately one third of the graduating class studies in Scotland, one third studies elsewhere in the United Kingdom and the remaining third studies overseas. From 2010 to 2019, the most popular university for St Leonards Leavers has been the University of Aberdeen. In this time, eight graduates have attended Cambridge or Oxford and two have attended an Ivy League university. Headmistresses and headmasters For the first 124 years, (when the school was an all-girls school) the Head of St Leonards was always a woman.

These fees include tuition, lodging for boarders, meals (lunch for day pupils, full-board for boarders) as well some textbooks and extra-curricular activities. However, there are additional extras not included and charged at a supplementary rate. The school does offer financial assistance to a limited number of Senior School and Sixth Form pupils who demonstrate sufficient financial need – covering up to 100% of fees. While St Leonards does award scholarships to pupils who've demonstrated excellence in a variety of fields, the scholarship does not result in a reduction of fees.  St Leonards Seniors  Former St Leonards pupils are known as St Leonards Seniors, as is the style at the sister institutions of Wycombe Abbey and Benenden School. St Leonards organises various reunions and events for Seniors in St Andrews and select cities around the world, while also providing online networking tools. = Notable St Leonards Seniors = Betty ArchdaleReview: The Suffragette's Daughter: Betty Archdale, API Network - early barrister; pioneer of women's education in Australia * Helen Archdale - feminist, suffragist and journalist * Elspeth Barker - author of \\"O, Caledonia!\\", formerly married to poet George Barker * Wilhelmina Barns-Graham - leading abstract painter, based in St Ives, Cornwall * Hilda Bruce - zoologist, discoverer of the Bruce effect * Hazel Byford, Baroness Byford DBE - Shadow Minister for Food and Rural Affairs * Jean Hunter Cowan - artist * Jackie Forster (Jacqueline Moir Mackenzie) - actress, TV personality, feminist and lesbian campaigner * Louisa Garrett Anderson - medical pioneer, social reformer, suffragist * Fiona Gaunt - television actor, mother of Genevieve Gaunt * Elizabeth Girling - Spanish Civil War veteran, political activist and charity campaigner * Kitty McKane Godfree - Wimbledon Ladies' Singles Champion, 1924 and 1926 * Margaret Haig Thomas (Lady Rhondda) - founder of political magazine Time and Tide * Betty Harvie Anderson (Baroness Skrimshire) - Conservative politician and peer * Anji Hunter - former Director of Government Relations, 10 Downing Street * Christina Keith (1889-1963) - academic and author * Kristin Linklater - vocal coach to many well-known actors, based at Columbia University * Anne Macaulay (née Russell) - musicologist, antiquarian and author * Chrystal Macmillan - barrister, feminist and pacifist * Catherine Marshall - suffragist and pacifist * Elizabeth Mavor - writer * Anna McElligott - musician * Max McElligott - lead singer of Wolf Gang * Kathleen Ollerenshaw DBE - mathematician and educationalist * Tessa Ransford - founder of the Scottish Poetry Library * Louise Robey - actress, singer, model * Rosabelle Sinclair - honoured in U.S. Lacrosse Hall of Fame, Baltimore * Dr. Alice Stewart (née Naish) - pioneering epidemiologist * Josephine Stewart Leading sports person, early Lacrosse and lifer at St Leonards * Stella Tennant - supermodel * Penny Thomson - film producer and former Director of Edinburgh International Film Festival * Fiona Watson - UN official killed in the Canal Hotel bombing, Baghdad * Audrey Withers - editor of Vogue from 1940 to 1960Drusilla Beyfus, 'Withers [married names Stewart, Kennett], (Elizabeth) Audrey (1905–2001), magazine editor' in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2005) See alsoSt Leonard's College References  External links  *Education Scotland: St Leonards School *Good Schools Guide: St Leonards School *Tatler Schools Guide: St Leonards School Category:Boarding schools in Fife Category:Charities based in Scotland Category:Education in St Andrews Category:Educational institutions established in 1877 Category:Independent schools in Fife Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Scotland Category:Member schools of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference Category:Primary schools in Fife Category:Secondary schools in Fife Category:Women's lacrosse Category:1877 establishments in Scotland ","title":"St Leonards School"},{"id":"5994297","text":"Barbara Bouchet (born Bärbel Gutscher; 15 August 1944)\\"Barbara Bouchet\\", glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com; retrieved 12 December 2014. is a German- American actress and entrepreneuse who lives and works in Italy. She has acted in more than 80 films and television episodes and founded a production company that has produced fitness videos and books. She also owns and operates a fitness studio. She appeared in Casino Royale (1967) as Miss Moneypenny, in Don't Torture a Duckling (1972) as Patrizia, in Sweet Charity (1969) as Ursula, in The Red Queen Kills Seven Times (1972) as Kitty Wildenbrück, in Caliber 9 (1972) as Nelly Bordon, in The Scarlet and The Black (1983) as Minna Kappler, and in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) as Mrs. Schermerhorn. Early life Bärbel Gutscher was born in Reichenberg, Sudetenland, a part of Czechoslovakia that was ceded to Nazi Germany and is today part of the Czech Republic. She had two sisters, Annette and Eileen, and two brothers, Peter and Wolfgang. Her father, Fritz, was a photographer, and her mother, Ingrid, was an actress. After World War II, her family was placed in a resettlement camp in the American occupation zone in Germany. They were granted permission to emigrate to the United States under the humanitarian provisions of the Displaced Persons Act of 1948.De Zayas, Alfred Maurice. A Terrible Revenge, Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition (2006); . After arriving in the United States, the family lived in Five Points, California on the west side of the Central Valley and eventually settled in San Francisco, where Gutscher was raised. During the early 1960s San Francisco Bay Area television station KPIX-TV ran a show named The KPIX Dance Party and offered Gutscher the opportunity to become a member of the show's dance group. These were teenage dancers who danced live to the hit songs of the day and became locally known in their own right by being on television six days per week. She was on the show from 1959 until 1962, then moved to Hollywood to get into the film industry, changing her Germanic sounding name to the French sounding Barbara Bouchet. Career Bouchet began her career modelling for magazine covers and appearing in television commercials, before eventually becoming an actress. Her first acting role was a minor part in What a Way to Go! (1964), which led to a series of other roles in the 1960s. She appeared in the films John Goldfarb, Please Come Home (1964), In Harm's Way (1964), and Agent for H.A.R.M. (1966). She appeared, semi-nude, in two editions of Playboy magazine: May 1965 (stills from In Harm's Way) and February 1967 (\\"The Girls of Casino Royale\\").\\"Playboy Magazine February 1967 vol.14, no.2\\". Vintage Playboy Mags; retrieved 12 December 2014. In Casino Royale (1967), Bouchet played the role of Miss Moneypenny. She guest-starred in the Star Trek episode \\"By Any Other Name\\" (1968), and appeared in the musical film Sweet Charity (1969) playing Ursula. Tired of being typecast and unable to get starring roles in Hollywood, Bouchet moved to Italy in 1970 and began acting in Italian films, such as Black Belly of the Tarantula and Sex with a Smile (40 gradi all'ombra del lenzuolo, or Forty Degrees In The Shade Of The Sheet, 1975). She starred with Gregory Peck in The Scarlet and The Black (1983), a successful TV movie. In 1985, she established a production company and started to produce a successful series of fitness books and videos. In addition, Bouchet opened a fitness studio in Rome. In 2002, Bouchet appeared in Gangs of New York, playing Mrs. Schermerhorn. Personal life In 1974, Bouchet married Luigi Borghese, a producer, with whom she has two sons: Alessandro (b. 1976), a TV chef, and Massimiliano (b. 1989), a bartender. Her husband subsequently produced some of her later films. They separated in 2006, citing different aspirations. Filmography =Films= A Global Affair (1964) as Woman * What a Way to Go!

Occurrence in other species, including tortoises,Giant tortoise cheats death (\\"Evening Express\\", Aberdeen, 31/01/2009) has been reported as well. The stones form in the urinary bladder in varying size and numbers secondary to infection, dietary influences, and genetics. Stones can form in any part of the urinary tract in dogs and cats, but unlike in humans, stones of the kidney are less common and do not often cause significant disease, although they can contribute to pyelonephritis and chronic kidney disease. Types of stones include struvite, calcium oxalate, urate, cystine, calcium phosphate, and silicate. Struvite and calcium oxalate stones are by far the most common. Signs and symptoms Bladder stones may cause blood in the urine (hematuria) (giving the appearance that the animal is urinating blood) but sometimes there may be no signs at all. Painful urination or straining to urinate are other signs. Urinary tract infections are commonly associated with bladder stones. Smaller stones may become lodged in the urethra, especially in male animals, causing urinary tract obstruction and the inability to urinate. This condition causes acute kidney failure, hyperkalemia, sepsis, and death within a few days. Mechanism Oversaturation of urine with crystals is by the far the biggest factor in stone formation in dogs and cats. This oversaturation can be caused by increased excretion of crystals by the kidneys, water reabsorption by the renal tubules resulting in concentration of the urine, and changes in urine pH that influence crystallization. Other contributing factors include diet, frequency of urination, genetics, current medications, and the presence of a urinary tract infection. The stones form around a nidus, which can consist of white blood cells, bacteria, and organic matrix mixed with crystals, or crystals alone. The nidus makes up about two to ten percent of the mass of the stone. It is possible for the nidus to be made of a different type of crystal than the rest of the stone, also known as epitaxial growth. Nutrition often plays a major role in the development of bladder stones. Sodium, calcium, phosphorus and potassium ratios and quantities play a large role in urinary health of animals. Research indicates that low dietary inclusion of potassium is associated with increased renal calcium excretion, which lowers urinary pH. By lowering urinary pH, the risk for development of calcium oxalate uroliths increases. By feeding proper amounts of calcium and potassium we avoid this issue, which is especially common in male cats.PaBlack, N., Brenten, T., Neumann, K., & Zentek, J. (2014). Effects of potassium chloride and potassium bicarbonate in the diet on urinary pH and mineral excretion of adult cats. British Journal of Nutrition, 111(5), 785-797. Diagnosis When symptoms indicate bladder stones, the first step is usually to take an x-ray. Most types of stones will appear readily in an x-ray, urate and occasionally cystine stones being the most common exceptions. Stones smaller than three millimeters may not be visible. Ultrasonography is also useful for identifying bladder stones. Crystals identified in a urinalysis may help identify the stones, but analysis of the stones is necessary for identification of the complete chemical composition. =Struvite stones= Struvite stones Struvite stones are also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate stones due to their chemical composition - MgNH4PO4·6H20\\\\. Often there is a small amount of calcium phosphate present. They form at a neutral to alkaline pH of the urine. Bacterial infections contribute to their formation by increasing the pH of the urine through the urease enzyme in dogs. More than 90 percent of dogs with struvite stones have an associated urease- producing bacterial infection in the urinary tract, but in cats struvite stones usually form in sterile urine. The appearance of the stones vary from large solitary stones to multiple smaller stones. They can assume the shape of the bladder or urethra. Struvite crystals Dissolution of the struvite stones depends on acidification of the urine through diet or urinary acidifiers. Special diets for dissolution also have reduced protein, phosphorus, and magnesium, as well as increased salt to increase water consumption and dilute the urine. The diet needs to be fed exclusively, but it can only be fed for a few months total due to potential side effects. Contraindications to this diet include heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, hypertension (high blood pressure), and hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin). Prevention of struvite stones is with a similar diet with milder restrictions. Certain dog breeds are predisposed to struvite stones, including Miniature Schnauzers, Bichon Frises, and Cocker Spaniels. They are the most commonly reported bladder stone in female dogs and in ferrets (pregnant ferrets may be especially predisposed). For frequency in cats, see below. =Calcium oxalate stones= Calcium oxalate stones Calcium oxalate stones form in an acidic to neutral urine. Two types naturally occur, calcium oxalate monohydrate, or whewellite (CaC2O4·H2O), and calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite (CaC2O4·2H2O). Their appearance can be rough, smooth, spiculated (needle- like), or jackstone. Calcium oxalate stones form more readily in animals with hypercalcaemia, which can caused by Addison's disease or certain types of cancer. Hypercalcaemia results in hypercalciuria, which can also be caused by Cushing's syndrome or hyperparathyroidism. There is no recommended diet to dissolve calcium oxalate stones. For prevention a diet low in protein and oxalates and high in magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium is recommended. Increased dietary magnesium and phosphorus decreases the amount of calcium in the urine, and increased dietary calcium reduces absorption of oxalates from the intestines. Potassium citrate has been recommended to prevent calcium oxalate stone formation because it forms a soluble complex with oxalates and promotes the formation of alkaline urine. Dog breeds possibly prone to calcium oxalate stones include Miniature Schnauzers, Lhasa Apsos, Yorkshire Terriers, Miniature Poodles, Shih Tzus, and Bichon Frises. They are the most common stone in male dogs. Calcium oxalate stones are also common in domestic rabbits. Rabbits are prone to hypercalciuria due to intestinal absorption of calcium not being dependent on vitamin D and a high fractional urinary excretion of calcium. The urine will appear thick and creamy or sometimes sandy. Small stones and sand can be removed using urohydropropulsion. Prevention is through reducing calcium intake by feeding more hay and less commercial rabbit pellets, and by not using mineral supplements. =Frequency of struvite and calcium oxalate stones in cats= The Minnesota Urolith Center at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine has done detailed analysis of uroliths from animals since 1981 and has noted changing trends in feline uroliths. In 1981, struvite stones were the most common type in cats, making up 78 percent of submitted samples, with only 2 percent comprising calcium oxalate stones. In the mid 1980s there was a substantial increase in the number of calcium oxalate samples, and between 1994 and 2002, 55 percent of feline stones were calcium oxalate and 33 percent were struvite. This may have been caused by the use of dissolution diets for struvite stones in cats and modification of other diets to prevent struvite crystal formation. These modifications predisposed to calcium oxalate crystal formation. However, in 2004, struvite stones once again surpassed calcium oxalate stones 44.9 percent to 44.3 percent, and in 2006, 50 percent of stones were struvite and 39 percent were calcium oxalate. This may have been due to the increased use of diets designed to prevent calcium oxalate crystal formation, which because of increased magnesium in the diet and decreased acidity of the urine help promote struvite crystal formation. Urethral plugs in cats are usually composed of struvite crystals and organic matter. =Urate stones= Urate stones Urate (C5H4N4O3) stones, usually ammonium urate (NH4·C5H4N4O3) or sodium urate monohydrate (Na·C5H4N4O3×H2O), form in an acidic to neutral urine. They are usually small, yellow-brown, smooth stones. Urate stones form due to an increased excretion of uric acid in the urine. Dalmatians (especially males) and to a lesser extent Bulldogs are genetically predisposed to the formation of urate stones because of an altered metabolism of purines. Dalmatians have a decreased rate of urate hepatic transport, leading to only about 30 to 40 percent conversion of urate to allantoin, compared with greater than 90 percent conversion in other breeds. Dogs with portosystemic shunts or endstage liver disease also have increased uric acid excretion in the urine due to reduced conversion of uric acid to allantoin and ammonia to urea. Urate stones make up about six percent of all stones in the cat. Urate stones can be dissolved using a diet with reduced purines that alkalinizes and dilutes the urine. Allopurinol is used in dogs with altered purine metabolism to prevent the formation of uric acid. Feeding a diet high in purines while simultaneously administering allopurinol can result in the formation of xanthine (C5H4N4O2) stones. =Cystine stones= Cystine ((SCH2CHNH2COOH)2) stones form in an acidic to neutral urine. They are usually smooth and round. They are caused by increased urine excretion of cystine (a relatively insoluble amino acid) in dogs with a defect in renal tubule reabsorption of cystine. Dietary reduction of protein and alkalinization of the urine may help prevent formation. Medications such as D-penicillamine and 2-MPG contain thiol, which forms a soluble complex with cystine in the urine. Dog breeds possibly predisposed to formation of cystine stones include Bulldogs, Dachshunds, Basset Hounds, Chihuahuas, Yorkshire Terriers, Irish Terriers, and Newfoundlands. In Newfoundlands, cystinuria is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, but in the other breeds it is a sex linked trait and found primarily in male dogs. =Calcium phosphate stones= Calcium phosphate, also known as hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), stones form in neutral to alkaline urine. They are usually smooth and round. Calcium phosphate is usually a component of struvite or calcium oxalate stones and is infrequently a pure stone. They form more readily with hypercalcaemia. Dog breeds possibly predisposed to calcium phosphate stone formation include Yorkshire Terriers, Miniature Schnauzers, and Cocker Spaniels. =Silicate stones= Silicate (SiO2) stones form in acidic to neutral urine. They are usually jackstone in appearance. There is possibly an increased incidence associated with dogs on diets that have a large amount of corn gluten or soybean hulls. Dog breeds possibly predisposed include German Shepherd Dogs, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, and Miniature Schnauzers. Treatment Reasons for treatment of bladder stones include recurring symptoms and risk of urinary tract obstruction. Some stones, including struvite and urate stones, can be dissolved using dietary modifications and/or medications. Calcium oxalate stones are not able to be dissolved and must be surgically removed. Small stones in female dogs may possibly be removed by urohydropropulsion, a nonsurgical procedure. Urohydropropulsion is performed under sedation by filling the bladder with saline through a catheter, holding the dog vertically, and squeezing the bladder to expel the stones through the urethra. Bladder stones can be removed surgically by a cystotomy, which is a small incision into the bladder to scoop out the stones. Stones lodged in the urethra can often be flushed into the bladder and removed, but sometimes a urethrotomy is necessary. In male dogs with recurrent urinary tract obstruction a scrotal urethrostomy creates a permanent opening in the urethra proximal to the area where most stones lodge, behind the os penis. In male cats, stones lodge where the urethra narrows in the penis. Recurrent cases can be treated surgically with a perineal urethrostomy, which removes the penis and creates a new opening for the urethra. To prevent recurrence of stones, special diets can be used for each type of stone. Increasing water consumption by the animal dilutes the urine, which prevents oversaturation of the urine with crystals.

Sisko and Quark are startled when an alien woman comes running out of the forest, pursued by a troop of fierce soldiers, who take all three captive. Sisko, Quark, and the woman, Eris, are taken to a cave where they are imprisoned in a force field. Eris warns Sisko that the field is lethal, and that she is unable to use her telekinetic abilities to disable it due to the suppressive collar around her neck. She explains that the soldiers are Jem'Hadar, bred and put into service by the Dominion, who rule that section of the Gamma Quadrant, and that they cannot be escaped or defeated. Sisko points out that they have been imprisoned together and are not under close guard, believing that he can use their captors' apparent overconfidence to their advantage, and begins by attempting to remove Eris' collar. Third Talak'talan, leader of the Jem'Hadar group, informs Sisko that the Dominion will no longer tolerate the presence of ships from the other side of the wormhole and reveals extensive knowledge of the Alpha Quadrant, but he refuses to allow Sisko to speak with the Founders, leaders of the Dominion, whom Eris then claims are a myth. After several hours, Sisko makes some progress on removing Eris' collar and enlists Quark to pick the lock. Meanwhile, Jake and Nog, having returned to camp to find Sisko and Quark gone, locate the Jem'Hadar encampment. They return to the runabout but are unable to beam the captives off the planet or bypass the ship's autopilot to break orbit in order to get help. When they finally gain control of the ship, they realize that without the autopilot, they will have to learn to pilot it themselves. Back on DS9, a ship arrives unexpectedly through the wormhole, and Talak'talan suddenly materializes in Ops, despite the station's shields being raised. He informs the crew that Sisko is being detained by the Dominion, then transports away before he can be caught, walking unaffected through a security forcefield. Captain Keogh, in command of the Galaxy-class starship U.S.S. Odyssey arrives at the station to assess the situation and mount a rescue mission. He allows the station's two remaining runabouts, crewed by Major Kira, O'Brien, Dax, Odo, and Dr. Bashir, to accompany the Odyssey on its mission. Quark manages to remove Eris' collar, allowing her to disengage the force field, and the three escape. Meanwhile, the Federation ships come under attack, with the Odyssey sustaining heavy damage, as the Jem'Hadar weapons are able to bypass its shields. O'Brien beams aboard Jake and Nog's runabout and assumes command, then beams aboard Sisko, Quark, and Eris. As the group begins to retreat to the Alpha Quadrant, one of the Jem'Hadar ships makes a suicide run at the Odyssey, colliding with it and destroying it almost instantly. Back at the station, Quark discovers Eris' collar is a fake, and they deduce that she is a spy for the Dominion, which she admits before transporting away — leaving the crew with the realization that their dealings with this powerful new opponent have only begun.  Reception  In 2018, Comic Book Resources rated \\"The Jem'Hadar\\" episode paired with its sequel \\"The Search\\" as the 14th best multi episode story of Star Trek. In 2015, Geek.com recommended this episode as \\"essential watching\\" for their abbreviated Star Trek: Deep Space Nine binge-watching guide. In 2019, ScreenRant ranked this the 4th best episode for the character Nog, noting how Nog was able work together with Jake.

It is located in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park in South Philadelphia, on part of a historic 17th-century land grant originally provided by Queen Christina of Sweden to settlers of New Sweden.American Swedish Historical Museum (Graham O'Neill. November 2008) History During 1926, the Swedish-American committee of the Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition of 1926 was formed. Noted author and historian, Amandus Johnson was elected to be its president. From this activity grew a committee to plan ways to preserve the memory of the New Sweden colony which dated to 1638. The New Sweden Tricentennial Association was formed which commissioned and published Swedes In America, 1638–1938, a work of historical research which was edited by Adolph B. Benson and Naboth Hedin (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. 1938).Swedes in America, 1638–1938 (New Sweden Tricentennial Association) Soon, the first national campaign was underway to erect a Swedish Museum in Philadelphia. On June 2, 1926, Sweden's Crown Prince and future King Gustaf VI Adolf placed the Museum's cornerstone. In the fall of 1928, Christian von Schneidau painted the Museum's entrance-hall ceiling and wall murals. The formal public dedication of the Museum took place on June 28, 1938. This event was set to coordinate with the 300th anniversary of the Swedish arrival on the Delaware shores. Swedish Prince Bertil and Princess Louise made up the royal party that dedicated the Museum. About American Swedish Historical Museum (Fairmount Park Council for Historic Sites) Building design The building's design is based on Ericsberg Castle, a 17th-century manor house in Södermanland, Sweden. The architect, John Nydén, a Swedish-American from Chicago, combined Swedish and American elements by modeling the exterior arcades on those of Mount Vernon. The copper cupola is a copy of the one atop Stockholm City Hall. The Museum has 12 permanent galleries displaying a broad and interesting collection combining history and culture. Three of the Museum’s 12 galleries are devoted to the history of the New Sweden Colony established in the Delaware Valley in 1638. The museum provides a wealth of information about this often unfamiliar period in history. Other galleries, ranging in style from Art Deco to International, concentrate on more recent Swedish contributions.

Clara Edwards (originally Bertha Edwards, Bertha Johnson and then Clara Johnson) is a fictional character on the American television sitcom The Andy Griffith Show (1960 - 1968). Clara was portrayed by actress Hope Summers. Summers appeared as Bertha/Clara in 32 episodes of TAGS and was one of only a few characters (the others being Andy Taylor, Aunt Bee, and Opie Taylor) who appeared in all eight seasons of the show's run. The character migrated to the show's spin-off series Mayberry R.F.D.. Overview Clara lives in the fictional community of Mayberry, North Carolina on \\"The Andy Griffith Show\\" (TAGS) and \\"Mayberry RFD\\". Clara's best friend is her past classmate Aunt Bee. The two women have a warm, yet competitive relationship, which began on a high school basketball team. Clara is something of a gossiper. She occasionally causes friction between Bee and Andy with her idle talk. The friendly rivalry between Bee and Clara would continue with such domestic contests as jarring pickles (TAGS, \\"The Pickle Story, Episode#31)\\", and planting prize roses (TAGS, \\"Only a Rose\\", Episode #212). In \\"The Pickle Story\\", TAGS, episode#31, Clara and Bee both compete for a blue ribbon at the county fair with their entries of pickles. Clara wins the ribbon. Clara is a descendant of the town's settlers, and a widow. (However, in Episode 14 of Season 6, she pointedly tells the guest character, Harlan Robinson, played by Woody Chambliss, that she is not \\"Mrs.\\" but \\"Miss\\" Edwards.) She has a brother (who never appears on the show), and an adult nephew Ferdie, who makes one appearance. She also has a son, Gale, who never appears on the show. She occasionally looks after Sheriff Andy Taylor and son Opie, when their Aunt Bee is out of town. Clara and Bee rival for the attentions of visiting single gentlemen, one of whom is Hubert Saint John, who takes a fancy to Bee as she reminds him of his late wife. When Bee cuts ties, Clara attempts to charm him. For a dozen years straight, Clara won Blue Ribbons for her pickles at the Mayberry County Fair, and annoyingly trumps every Mayberry flower contest. She is the organist at All Souls Church. Along with Bee, she composes a pro Mayberry anthem (\\"My Home Town\\"). Clara teaches Opie piano, and joins his rock group as pianist/ manager. She, Bee and friend Myrtle, take a free trip to Mexico. As a prominent church lady, and later, town council member (\\"Mayberry RFD\\"), she heavyhandedly asserts herself on such matters as parades (\\"Mayberry's Float\\", RFD episode #39), and scorning such locals as Howard (TAGS, \\"Howard The Comedian\\", episode #216 and \\"The Panel Show\\", RFD episode #6), and Millie (\\"The Church Play\\", RFD episode #8). In season one of TAGS, the character appeared twice (including Episode #23) as \\"Bertha Edwards.\\" In the second season she became \\"Clara Johnson\\" and remained so until the fifth- season episode \\"The Pageant,\\" when she morphed into \\"Clara Edwards.\\" She remained Clara Edwards until the end of the series' run.

Its distinctive shape is easily recognised as it comprises a large platform (which functions as a helicopter deck) supported by a single pillar rising out of the water. Originally, the platform was manned by three full-time keepers, accommodation being contained in the 'cabin section' immediately below the platform. Construction and installation The lighthouse replaced a lightship that had marked the Royal Sovereign Shoal since 1875. The structure was built, in two parts, on Newhaven beach, and put into position in 1970. First, the base and attached column were floated out to the shoal, where the hollow base was flooded and allowed to sink into position. Then the cabin section and superstructure were floated out, positioned over the base and allowed to settle on to the column as the tide fell. Afterwards the telescopic inner section of the column was jacked up, increasing its height by . Operation The lighthouse was brought into operation at noon on 6 September 1971, whereupon the lightship was towed away. Initially, the light source was a 1,000 watt bulb set within a revolving 3.5 order catadioptric optic, mounted in a superstructure on the corner of the platform. Beneath the lantern, on two intermediate levels, were the sounder, air tanks and associated equipment for the diaphone fog horn, below which the main control room was located (on platform-level). Power was provided by four 20 kW diesel generators, housed in the cabin section of the structure along with two diesel compressors (which, as well as supplying the fog horn, powered a crane on the platform). The optic completed one revolution per minute, thus displaying one flash every 20 seconds with a range of . The light was automated in 1994. At the same time, the optic and lamp were replaced (reducing the range to ) and converted to solar-powered operation, and the fog horn replaced by an electric emitter. As of 2006 the light was controlled by a 475 MHz radio link to Trinity House managed by Vodafone; the platform was still occasionally occupied. Decommissioning In June 2019, Trinity House announced that the lighthouse would be decommissioned, and then removed, because of the platform's structural condition.

Her monument sculpted by Rodrigo Arenas stands in Neiva, the capital of the Huila Department in Colombia.  Pre-Columbian era  Map of indigenous peoples in the south of Huila According to Spanish chronologists, at the time of conquest, the modern territory of Huila Department was inhabited by many different indigenous peoples. The Yalcón (with nearly 6,000 warriors), the Avirama, the Pinao, the Guanaca, and the Paez lived north of the Magdalena River, with later concentrations around the La Plata River. South of the Magdalena River lived the Andaquí and Timaná and to the east lived the Pijao.  Pedro de Añasco  Pedro de Añasco was a Spanish conquistador, sent by Sebastián de Belalcázar to found a village in the territory of what is today Timaná, in order to create a trade route through the Magdalena Valley. De Añasco called all the indigenous leaders and demanded them to pay him a tribute. A tribe of Yalcón people, commanded by a young man and his mother (cacica Gaitana) delayed the payment, and De Añasco decided to set an example by ordering her son to be burned alive.  Revenge  The execution of Gaitana's son caused outrage among the indigenous tribes, who decided to cooperate with each other to join forces against the Spaniards. Añasco and his men were attacked by surprise. The men were executed and Añasco had his eyes removed and was dragged around the village until he died.  Betrayal  However, one of the indigenous leaders, Cacique Matambo, betrayed the organized indigenous forces. Matambo warned the Spaniards about plans against them with the result that the indigenous forces were crushed and the remaining indigenous people were gradually decimated by slavery, smallpox and other European diseases. A few hundred thousand of their descendants are scattered throughout the Colombian southwest as the modern Paez people, Guambiano people, and Pijao people among others.

Plot introduction The Gernian Cavalla Academy that has been established according to the King's wishes has suffered from the rivalry between the Old Lords and the King's New Lords. These are newly raised soldiers who won distinction in the push east and the conflicts with the plains people. However a new foe appears in the guise of the \\"Specks\\". The book is written in first person, in the perspective of the main character, Nevare Burvelle. Plot summary The story picks up where Shaman's Crossing left off. The Gernian Cavalla Academy is recovering from the devastating effects of Speck plague, a disease causing severe dysentery. The disease has run through the ranks of all the Academy (and civilian) population of Old Thares, killing many of the Old and New Noble soldier sons and leaving the Academy ranks severely depleted. Many who were fortunate enough to have survived the outbreak, including Nevare Burvelle's friend Spinrek \\"Spink\\" Kester, have been forced to resign from the academy and return to their homes to struggle with the long-term effects of the disease. Cadet Burvelle also returns home, to attend his brother Rosse's wedding. Nevare continues to have dreams about a seductive Speck woman (usually referred to as \\"Tree Woman\\") whom he fought to stop the plague epidemic in the dreamworld. On the way home, he stops as a tourist to see a giant spindle-shaped monument belonging to the Kidona plains people, but the Speck magic working through him causes him to accidentally destroy it. Unlike most of those who were affected by the plague, Nevare was not left weak and gaunt after his bout of plague; in fact, he is swiftly gaining weight. This fact is annoying but does not affect his thinking too much as he travels home expecting to meet with his betrothed, a beautiful young noblewoman, Carsina. Yet the reaction he receives on returning home brings into stark relief the physical problem that he struggles with: the Speck plague has caused him to \\"grow\\" rather than shrink and waste away. This is a virtually unknown reaction to the plague and is seen by Nevare's father, who will not listen to his excuses, as the result of gluttony. Nevare also visits his old mentor, the Kidona warrior Dewara who introduced him to the dream world. The Kidona tribe has been reduced to a bunch of derelicts living on a reservation due to the actions of the Gernian government. Dewara also blames Nevare for being seduced by Tree Woman and destroying the Spindle, the source of Kidona magic. Nevare's betrothal to Carsina, though informal, is cancelled. After his fruitless attempts to lose weight, Nevare is locked away by his father and his meals regulated. However, while Nevare is locked away, a plague ravages the Widevale Estate, killing many, including his mother, eldest sister and brother Rosse. Nevare and his sister Yaril survive and run the estate while their father is in mourning, but when their father recovers, he banishes and disowns Nevare. Nevare travels east toward the remote outpost Gettys. On the way, he stops at a small settlement called \\"Dead Town\\" and helps a widow, Amzil, and her three children by doing odd jobs to make their lives easier, in exchange he gets to eat and sleep there. Nevare wants to win Amzil's trust, but she finds it hard to trust men, having had to work as a prostitute to feed herself and her children. One day, a wounded cavalla scout named Buel Hitch reaches the town and asks Nevare's assistance in getting to Gettys, to which Nevare agrees. As they leave, he uses his dormant Speck magic to create a bountiful vegetable garden for Amzil, and his Speck self comes closer to the surface. On their journey to Gettys, Nevare realises that Hitch is in a similar position to his: he is a tool of the Speck magic also. The Gernian goal of building a highway through the forest is being blocked by Speck magic. He enlists in the army there, but only as a lowly cemetery guard, a far cry from his former goal of a cavalla officer. He works very hard and the colonel is thinking about promoting him. After a while he meets two Specks, a girl named Olikea and her father. Olikea brings Nevare food that satisfies the magic that runs through his veins. He is getting pulled between two worlds, the Gernian world and the Specks' magical forests. He does not know where to settle down and he does not wish to betray his own people. Nevare's reputation is damaged by his gross appearance and his attempts to talk to his ex-fiancee Carsina, who has moved to Gettys with her new husband. Spink Kester and Nevare's Cousin Epiny, married, are also in town, but he distances himself so as not to ruin their reputation. One day at his way home he gets attacked and shot in the head. His horse is stolen and he is left on the ground with his head bleeding. However, he survives and the wound heals rapidly due to his magic. Unfortunately, Nevare's magic is not as strong as it could be, since he has been avoiding the Specks so he could not get the magical food that Olikea brought. The cavalla scout Buel Hitch (also a Gernian seduced by the Specks) uses the stolen horse's bridle to strangle a prostitute who was friendly with Nevare, thus framing him for murder. As days go by, the Speck plague sweeps by the outpost of Gettys so Nevare is kept busy as cemetery guard/gravedigger. Among the dead is Carsina, who revives briefly at the cemetery and is cared for by Nevare, then dies in his bed. He is accused of necrophilia in addition to the earlier murder, and sentenced to be tortured and hanged. But fortunately for Nevare, the Tree Woman comes and frees him from his cell and impending doom. During his escape, confrontations with Spinrek and Amzil and the townspeople force Nevare to finally give in to the magic. With his magic, he gives the townspeople false memories of his death before embracing his future life in the forest.

Summary This video game was released exclusively in Japan on December 18, 1992 for the Nintendo Family Computer.Barcode World (NES). GameSpot. Retrieved 10 May 2011. As the title suggests, it is a video game where players use a Barcode Battler II (a card-scanning handheld) together with a Nintendo-licensed Famicom- Barcode Battler interface that came packaged with the game and not sold separately. A special set of Barcode Battler cards with barcodes imprinted on them were also required to play the game including the \\"White Card\\" that enabled players to scan any barcode (especially ones found on consumer products).Barcode World. Atari HQ. Retrieved 10 May 2011. Barcode World includes barcode cards that feature characters from many Sunsoft series, most notably Hebereke and Gimmick!, however using the White Card included with the game, players were also given the ability to scan a wide range of consumer products. Released during a period of great interest in barcode-swiping games in Japan, the game dates itself as directly from the early 1990s, however the game still functions today exactly as it did then and modern products may also be scanned in order to generate new content for the game (RPG-style stats and attributes, etc.). Legacy The use of the Barcode Battler unit in conjunction with the Famicom was made possible using the Famicom-Barcode Battler interface – a connector cable that came with the Barcode World cassette. In this way, the Famicom was given the capacity to scan external barcodes to expand gameplay for the game to include all manner of household consumer products. Soon books were released by third parties that listed in detail which consumer products had the strongest barcodes. Today, the setup has been seen as a precursor to the 2001 Nintendo e-Reader for the Game Boy Advance. The two devices are very similar in that they serve the same purpose: to scan specially designed cards with barcodes imprinted on them as the primary means of using the device. The game continues to be played today often in emulated form, and modern emulators like FCEUX feature support specifically for the unusual Barcode World setup.Kohler, Chris. Retro Gaming Hacks.

Herpetology: Third Edition. Pearson Prentice Hall:Pearson Education, Inc., 2002. It is the common name for the family Pygopodidae, but often refers to other groups, such as limbless anguids, depending on the region of the world. These lizards are often distinguishable from snakes on the basis of one or more of the following characteristics: possessing eyelids, possessing external ear openings, lack of broad belly scales, notched rather than forked tongue, having two more-or- less-equal lungs, and/or having a very long tail (while snakes have a long body and short tail). Many families of lizards have independently evolved limblessness or greatly reduced limbs (which are presumably non-functional in locomotion), including the following examples: * Anguidae – 102 species, of which 17 are limbless and in the genera Ophisaurus, Pseudopus and Anguis from Eurasia and North America. * Cordylidae – an African family of 66 species, with one virtually legless genus Chamaesaura, containing five species with hindlimbs reduced to small scaly protuberances. * Pygopodidae – all 44 species; they belong to the genera Aprasia, Delma, Lialis, Ophidiocephalus, Paradelma, Pletholax and Pygopus. All are endemic to Australia, except the two species of Lialis, which also occur in New Guinea, one of which is endemic to that island. Pygopodids are not strictly legless since, although they lack forelimbs, they possess hindlimbs that are greatly reduced to small digitless flaps, hence the often used common names of \\"flap-footed lizards\\" or \\"scaly- foot\\". The pygopodids are considered an advanced evolutionary clade of the Gekkota, which also contains six families of geckos. * Dibamidae – all 23 species in the family, which comprises the monotypic Mexican genus Anelytropsis and the Southeast Asian genus Dibamus. All are limbless burrowers that are nearly or completely blind. * Anniellidae – comprising the single genus Anniella, which contains six legless lizards that inhabit central / southern California and Baja California, Mexico. * Gymnophthalmidae – a large neotropical family containing many species with reduced limbs, the most extreme being the 23 species in the genus Bachia, which escape by making sudden saltatory \\"figure-8\\" flicks with the body and tail. * Scincidae – commonly known as skinks, the largest lizard family with over 1500 species, of which many are limbless and nearly-limbless species, including (but not confined to) the genera Acontias, Feylinia, Melanoseps, Paracontias and Typhlosaurus from Africa, Lerista from Australia, and some species in the genera Chalcides from southern Europe and North Africa, and Scelotes from southern Africa.

He is best known for his studies on the traditional systems of navigation used by the Pacific Islanders. His studies, published in the book We, the Navigators, made these navigational methods known to a wide audience and helped to inspire a revival of traditional voyaging methods in the South Pacific. Early life Lewis was born in Plymouth, England, and raised in New Zealand and Rarotonga. He was sent to the Polynesian school in Rarotonga, where he apparently developed his appreciation for Polynesian identity and culture. He remained a New Zealander throughout his life, though he eventually retired to Queensland. After an adventurous childhood and teenage years including mountaineering and skiing in New Zealand, and a multi- hundred mile kayak journey, he traveled to England in 1938 for medical training at the University of Leeds, and served in the British army as a medical officer. After the war, he worked as a doctor in London, and was involved in setting up the National Health Service. Sailing With the announcement in 1960 of the first single-handed trans-Atlantic yacht race (from Plymouth, UK to the US East Coast), Lewis decided to enter in a small 25-foot boat. Following a series of accidents, including a dismasting shortly after leaving, he finished third (Francis Chichester came first), as described in his book The Ship Would Not Travel Due West. He later decided to sail around the world with his second wife and two small daughters, and built the ocean cruising catamaran Rehu Moana, for this purpose. After an initial voyage towards Greenland, he entered the 1964 single-handed trans-Atlantic race and picked up his family in the United States. They circumnavigated by way of the Strait of Magellan, the South Pacific and the Cape of Good Hope. (See his book Daughters of the Wind.) This was the world’s first circumnavigation by multihull. Following his longstanding interest in old navigational methods used to explore and populate the Pacific, he employed similar techniques for the Tahiti-New Zealand leg of the Rehu Moana voyage without using a compass, sextant or marine chronometer. Study and literary career In 1967, Lewis acquired another boat, Isbjorn, to embark on further field studies of traditional Polynesian navigation. With a research grant from the Australian National University and with his second wife, two daughters and 19-year-old son, he set out for the Pacific again to study traditional navigation techniques. While there, he was welcomed into the cultures of various Pacific Islanders such as Hipour, who taught him their navigational lore, heretofore largely unrecognized by those outside Polynesia. Lewis chronicled this voyage and research in various articles and in his books We, the Navigators and The Voyaging Stars. Lewis’ voyages and resulting books gave inspiration to the revival in traditional Polynesian canoe building and voyaging, which was essentially extinct in many parts of the Pacific. In 1976, Lewis joined Polynesian Voyaging Society's first experimental voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti on Hokule'a. The team successfully navigated using traditional methods to Tahiti. Lewis departed from Hokule'a in Tahiti and went on to work in his own research. Along with Dr. Marianne (Mimi) George, he proposed that original Polynesian navigation is still alive in the Polynesian outlier Taumako. Lewis’ next adventure in 1972 was an attempt at circumnavigating Antarctica single- handed. For this he acquired a small steel yacht, named Ice Bird. Facing treacherous conditions in the Southern Ocean after departing, Lewis was not heard from for 13 weeks but eventually managed to sail the Ice Bird to the Antarctic Peninsula under a jury rig after dismasting. Lewis was rescued by personnel from the Antarctic research outpost Palmer Station, who subsequently repaired the Ice Bird while Lewis spent the Antarctic winter in Australia. Ice Bird trials off Palmer Station, 1973 After returning eight months later, Lewis left Palmer station to complete the voyage, but that very same day was caught in a heavy ice field and had to be towed to open water by the R.V. Hero. Later, Lewis capsized again and eventually brought the boat to Cape Town, South Africa. Edited aspects of these events are described in his bestseller book, Ice Bird. His son, Barry, sailed the yacht back to Sydney from South Africa where it underwent extensive work to prevent further corrosion. In 1982, Dr. Lewis donated \\"Ice Bird\\" to the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia. After the Ice Bird voyage, Lewis was involved in setting up the Oceanic Research Foundation with the aim of sending private expeditions to the Antarctic. In a 17.4 metre (57 ft) Alan Payne designed steel yacht named \\"Solo\\" with seven other crew, Lewis made a summer expedition to Antarctica and wintered over there, 1977-78. Lewis spent some of his later years conducting research into traditional navigation techniques of the Inuit on the Bering Strait region. One obituary said of Lewis that he “always brought his crews home intact. He was a typical Polynesian sailor, getting into trouble through haste and neglect, then, with near superhuman courage and seamanship, fighting his way out of it.” Following this, he retired to New Zealand to write his autobiography, Shapes on the Wind; one of 12 books he wrote. In the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours, Lewis was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to yachting and exploration. He finally retired to Australia, and died at Gympie, Queensland. See alsoCelestial navigation *Hipour *Polynesian navigation Publications #The Ship Would Not Travel Due West, by David H.

The company was founded in Sheffield by George Bassett in 1842. Perhaps the company's best-known sweets, the Liquorice Allsorts, were created by accident in 1899 and in 1926 the mascot of Bassett's, Bertie Bassett, was created; Bertie continues to represent the brand today. In 2016, the brand was joined with Maynards to create Maynards Bassetts. History The Sheffield Directory of 1842 records George Bassett as being \\"wholesale confectioner, lozenge maker and British wine trader\\". In 1851, Bassett took on an apprentice called Samuel Meggitt Johnson, who later became Bassett's son-in-law. His descendants ran the company until Gordon Johnson retired as chairman in the 1970s. Bassett's was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1929. They opened up a factory in Broad Street, Sheffield in 1852. The site moved in 1933 to Owlerton in another district of the city and remains there today. Unclaimed Babies were being produced during the 19th century, especially in the North West of England. In 1918, Bassetts launched their own range of the soft sweets which they called Peace Babies. They were re-launched as Jelly babies in the 1950s and were allegedly thrown at the Beatles during concerts as they were a favourite of George Harrison. The Liquorice Allsorts variety was created by accident when Bassett salesman Charlie Thompson dropped the samples of several different products in front of a prospective client. The client was taken by the idea of selling the sweets all mixed up and in return for the success, the company allowed the client to name the new brand. Barratt & Co. Ltd. was acquired in a friendly takeover by Bassett's in 1966. In 1989, the combined firms were acquired by the then-united Cadbury-Schweppes company in a deal brokered for £91 million. In 2016, all the products were re-marketed under the Maynards Bassett dual branding.

He has spent most of the years since 1988 imprisoned by the state for his opposition activities. The New York Times has described him as Burma's \\"most influential opposition figure after Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\\". Early life/student years Min Ko Naing was born in Yangon, the third son of Thet Nyunt and Hla Kyi, a couple from Mudon in Mon State. He has three sisters: Kyi Kyi Nyunt, Ye Ye Nyunt, and Thadar Nyunt. Min Ko Naing's interest in politics began at the Rangoon Arts and Science University in the mid-1980s where he studied Zoology. During his student years, he was an active member of the arts club, where he enjoyed reading, writing poems and drawing cartoons, especially satirical ones. According to classmates, Min Ko Naing was a member of a performance troupe which took part in the traditional Than Gyat competition during Thingyan (Burma's annual Water Festival) in April. Taking the name \\"Goat-Mouth and Spirit-Eye\\", the troupe performed satirical plays and sketches satirizing Burma's military government and the lack of freedom and democracy. Though the troupe was popular, it also attracted the attention of Burmese Military Intelligence agents, who began to track Min Ko Naing's movements. Despite the illegality of forming student unions in Burma, Min Ko Naing and other students formed clandestine study groups to discuss Burma's political situation, which grew into a secret student union. 8-8-88 Uprising and the All Burma Federation of Student Unions In September 1987, Ne Win voided most denominations of the kyat without warning, causing many people to lose their savings overnight. Students who saved money for tuition fees were particularly affected. The announcement led to riots at several universities.Lwin, Nyi Nyi. (1992). Refugee Student Interviews. A Burma-India Situation Report. The situation was further exacerbated by the shooting of protesting student Phone Maw in a 12 March 1988 clash with police.Boudreau, Vincent. (2004). Resisting Dictatorship: Repression and Protest in Southeast Asia. Cambridge University Press. . p. 193. On 16 March, Min Ko Naing organized a rally of 3,000 students on the RASU campus in which he spoke about the role of student movements in Burmese history. When the students attempted to march to the Rangoon Institute of Technology, where Phone Maw had been killed, they encountered a barbed wire barricade at Inya Lake and were attacked by riot police, resulting in several deaths and many arrests. Shortly after this, Ne Win's government closed the universities, and the movement went underground. Min Ko Naing continued to organize protesters and circulate posters of the violence at Inya Lake. Ne Win soon agreed to step down from office, and on 7 July, many imprisoned student activists were released. The following day, Min Ko Naing and others released the first statement in the name of the new All Burma Federation of Student Unions (ABFSU), an organization that had previously been known for its struggle against British colonial rule: \\"We shouldn't be swayed by the release of our fellow students. We will continue to fight.\\"The ABSFU continued to release statements by Min Ko Naing urging protests to the military government, including one calling for a general strike on 8-8-88, a number which would later become synonymous with the movement itself. The 8-8-88 general strike drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets of Yangon, and is widely seen as a turning point in the Burmese democracy movement. Min Ko Naing continued to speak to crowds in front of the US Embassy and Rangoon General Hospital, the sites of previous killings of protesters by Burmese government forces. He also arranged for the daughter of independence hero Aung San, Aung San Suu Kyi, to make her first speech to a crowd at Shwedagon Pagoda. Aung San Suu Kyi would go on to be elected prime minister in the 1990 general election, only to be denied office and imprisoned by the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the new military government. The protests lasted until 18 September, at which point soldiers opened fire on the crowds, resulting in at least 3,000 deaths. 15 years political imprisonment until 2004 Forced to go underground, Min Ko Naing continued his organizing work while moving from house to house every night to avoid arrest. After several months, he was captured along with other students. He was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment, under Section 5(j) of the 1950 Emergency Provisions Act for instigating \\"disturbances to the detriment of law and order, peace and tranquility\\". His sentence was commuted to 10 years under a general amnesty in January 1993. He was considered a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International, which intensively campaigned for his release. According to Amnesty International, Min Ko Naing was severely tortured and ill-treated during the early stages of his detention. His health suffered as a consequence. During his interrogation he was reportedly forced to stand in water for two weeks until he collapsed, and as a result, his left foot became totally numb. On 19 November 2004, he was released from prison, after being imprisoned for 15 years. Second imprisonment Min Ko Naing was rearrested in late September 2006. Htay Kywe, Ko Ko Gyi, Pyone Cho and Min Zeya were arrested along with him, in advance of Burma's 2006 national convention. In January 2007, they were released, without official explanation for either their original arrest or their sudden release. Campaigns Following his release from prison, Min Ko Naing helped to found the 88 Generation Students Group, which continued to fight for democracy in Burma. From 10 October 2006 to 18 October 2006 (his 44th birthday), some of the \\"88 generation\\" students organized a nationwide campaign, “White Expression” to pressure the military government to release him and all of political prisoners. Participants wore white clothing in a show of support for the release of all political prisoners. They also organized the signature campaign to pressure the junta to release him and all political prisoners. It was started a week after Min Ko Naing and four colleagues were arrested. Many well-known artists from Myanmar (such as Ludu Daw Amar and Zarganar) signed the petition. On 4 January 2007, the 88 Generation Students organized the \\"Open Heart Campaign\\". He said to the Irrawaddy Magazine that the campaign was to encourage the people to exercise freedom of expression. People could write to State Peace and Development Council leader senior general Than Shwe about their feelings under the military government. The 88 Generation Students Group also conducted a “White Sunday” campaign from 11 March 2007 to 20 May 2007 to express support for family members of political prisoners. They visited the families of political prisoners in Yangon every Sunday during this period. Political imprisonment in 2007 He was arrested again around midnight on 21 August 2007, with other 13 leaders of the 88 Generation Students for organizing peaceful demonstrations. United States Government condemned the Burmese junta's arrest of them. On 11 November 2008 Min Ko Naing was sentenced to 65 years imprisonment, as 22 others had been for their role in the August 2007 demonstrations. On 15 November 2008 Min Ko Naing was transferred to Kengtung prison in Shan State, where isolated, bleak cells were constructed in mid-2000 for solitary confinement. Release and political career Min Ko Naing was released along with numerous other activists on 13 January 2012, as part of a mass presidential pardon for political activists. It was believed that he would contest the 2015 general elections, for a seat in Assembly of the Union but he was not contested in the election. Many observers have said that beyond Aung Sann Suu Kyi, he and his colleagues are best suited to steer the country’s political landscape. International recognition Min Ko Naing has won numerous international awards for his activism. These include the 2009 Gwangju Prize for Human Rights; the 2005 Civil Courage Prize, which he shared with Anna Politkovskaya and Munir Said Thalib; the 2000 Homo Homini Award of People In Need; the 2001 Student Peace Prize; and the 1999 John Humphrey Freedom Award, which he shared with Cynthia Maung of the Mae Tao Clinic. In 2012, he was announced the winner of an award from the US National Endowment for Democracy, but stated his intention not to attend the ceremony in solidarity with other Burmese activists who had been denied visas. Rohingya genocide In a press conference, September 13, 2017  at the height of the Rohingya genocide (the persecution of, and attacks upon, Myanmar's mostly- Muslim ethnic minority, the Rohingya)  Min Ko Naing had reportedly appeared with a group of 88 Generation Peace and Open Society activists, at which the attendees issued a written statement denying the version of events portrayed in prominent international media. Speaking at the event, Min Ko Naing sided with Myanmar's civilian government in its harsh dealing with the Rohingya community. He said that the problems in Rakhine's state were not religious or racial, but rather were about terrorism and immigration laws  stating that the Rohingya \\"are not one of 135 ethnic groups in Myanmar.”\\"88 Generation Peace and Open Society Stand by Govt on Rakhine,\\" September 13, 2017, The Irrawaddy, retrieved June 1, 2020\\"Activists championed by rights groups have history of anti-Rohingya messaging,\\" May 24, 2020, Frontier Myanmar, retrieved June 1, 2020 References External linksInterview with Min Ko Naing on November 23, 2004 Category:1962 births Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Myanmar Category:Burmese democracy activists Category:Living people Category:Burmese people of Mon descent Category:People from Yangon Category:University of Yangon alumni Category:Burmese Theravada Buddhists Category:People from Mon State Category:Burmese prisoners and detainees ","title":"Min Ko Naing"},{"id":"5994588","text":"Glen Allen Currie (born July 18, 1958) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey left winger.

Born in La Roche-sur-Yon, he helped found a local independent Marxist organisation while he was still in his teens. Expelled from school, he moved to Paris and became associated with the Trotskyist group around La Verité. In 1930, the group founded the Communist League. It considered itself an external faction of the Communist Party of France and so admitted current and former members of the French Communist Party. However, the rule was relaxed, and Craipeau was allowed to join in 1931. He joined the League's executive committee with the responsibility for developing a youth wing. By 1933, he was able to organise a meeting attended by 1000 members of the youth wings of the Communist Party and the Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière. In 1933, he was Trotsky's personal secretary. In 1936, Craipeau became a leading member of the new Internationalist Workers Party (POI). The following year, in reaction to Trotsky's The Revolution Betrayed, he began a re-analysis of the nature of the Soviet Union. He concluded that it could not be defended, as Trotsky held, as a degenerated workers' state but that it was a bureaucratic collectivist system, an idea that he introduced to Trotskyism. During World War II, he was pronounced unfit for duty, and attempted, with Marcel Hic, to publish La Verité secretly. This was difficult, and following a series of setbacks, he turned instead to work influencing the German Army. He wrote an account of this activity in his books Contre vents et marées and La Libération Confisquée. The former work, on the Occupation period itself, was published in English in 2013. In 1944, Craipeau was the architect of unity between three of France's four Trotskyist groups: the POI itself, the Comités Communistes Internationalistes and the Octobre group. They formed the PCI Internationalist Communist Party, and in 1946, he was elected its General Secretary. In the same year, he was also elevated to the International Secretariat of the Fourth International. However, he could not agree with the International's perspective that a crisis in capitalism was imminent, and soon after the POI sided with the International, he was expelled. Craipeau temporarily withdrew from politics, and in 1951, he moved to Basse-Terre in Guadeloupe, where he became a school teacher and soon secretary of the National Education Federation trade union. In 1954, Craipeau returned to mainland France, where he participated in the creation of the New Left. This fused with the Movement for the Liberation of the City to form the Socialist Left Union and, in 1960 with several groups to form the Unified Socialist Party. He remained a leading member of this party for many years, during which he wrote numerous books on left-wing politics and revolution.

J., C. Grismado & T. Blick. 2004. Notes on the spider family Agelenidae in southern South America (Arachnida: Araneae). Revista Ibérica de Aracnología. 9: 179-182. In the UK it is sometimes known as the cardinal spider because of the legend that Cardinal Wolsey was terrified by this species at Hampton Court, or, conversely, because he regarded them as lucky and forbade anyone to harm them. In 2013, Tegenaria taprobanica was included in this species. Appearance Females have a body length up to 20 mm, males up to 17 mm. Their legs are approximately three times longer. They are reddish brown, but young spiders may be much paler up to the last moult. Up close, they are easily differentiated from T. domestica by the lengths of their legs: the front pair is almost as long as species in the genus Eratigena, while the hind pair is unshortened and similar to T. domestica. They also have more abundant hair on their tibias. Females can live for up to eight years, while males die shortly after mating. These spiders live mostly in buildings or walls. They look rather similar to T. ferruginea. Tegenaria parietina with a 3.5 inch diskette in the background. Taxonomy The species was first described by Antoine François de Fourcroy in 1785, as Aranea parietina. He called it \\"the brown domestic spider\\" that lived in the corners of rooms. \\"L'Araignée brune domestique .. Habitat angulos murorum\\". It was given its current generic placement by Eugène Simon in 1875. It has been misidentified by several authors as Tegenaria domestica. Tegenaria taprobanica was included in T. parietina by Bolzern et al. (2013), who considered that the very short original description of T. taprobanica would fit a very large specimen of T. parietina. p. 125. The inclusion is recognized by the World Spider Catalog.

It lies in Water-cum-Jolly Dale at the foot of Cressbrook Dale. Population details at the 2011 Census are included in the civil parish of Litton. Before its Enclosure Act of 1762 Cressbrook did not exist. It later grew up around a textile mill complex built alongside the River Wye, first by Richard Arkwright and then later by his son Richard, JL Philips and Brother Cotton Spinners and McConnel and Company. Until McConnel's period of ownership the village did not exist beyond a collection of buildings in the immediate vicinity of the mill. When McConnel's workforce objected to the quality of the housing available he took it upon himself to build the model village that became Cressbrook. Building started in the late 1830s and was later extended by Henry McConnel's daughter, Mary Worthington, in 1902 to include a village club, modelled on a working men's club. Cressbrook Mill went bankrupt in 1965, after which time it changed from being a private mill estate to the public village that it now is. The Monsal Trail passes Cressbrook Mill. This walk and cycleway mostly follows the old trackbed of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway where, from 1866 to 1959, the village of Cressbrook was served by Monsal Dale railway station.Truman, P., Hunt, D., (1989) Midland Railway Portrait Sheffield: Platform 5 Publishing Until May 2011 the Cressbrook Tunnel (and others) were closed to walkers and cyclists for safety reasons and the Trail diverted across the River Wye next to the Mill. David Cannon McConnel emigrated to Queensland, Australia in 1840. In 1841, he established the Cressbrook Homestead named after their home town. The homestead in turn gives its name to the modern-day localities of Cressbrook, Queensland and Lower Cressbrook, Queensland.  Publications  The history of Cressbrook was recently captured in the book Behind The View — Life and times in Cressbrook, a Derbyshire Mill village. This was written by and published by the Cressbrook Community association with the help of a grant from the Local Heritage Initiative, a Countryside Agency project. Bill Bryson writes warmly about Cressbrook Mill in his 2015 travel memoir The Road to Little Dribbling: More Notes from a Small Island.

This festival is celebrated annually in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, as well as in other parts of the state. It is celebrated in the month of Ashada Masam, which is around July and/or August. Special \\"poojas\\" (worship/ ceremonies) are performed for Yellamma (one of the many regional forms of Mahakali) on the first and last day of the festival. The festival is also considered a thanksgiving to the Goddess for fulfillment of vows. The word Bonam is a contraction of the word Bhojanam, a Sanskrit loanword which means a meal or a feast in Telugu. It is an offering to the Mother Goddess. Women prepare rice cooked with milk and jaggery in a new brass or earthen pot adorned with neem leaves, turmeric, vermilion and a lit lamp on top of the pot. Women carry the pots on their heads and make an offering of the Bonam along with turmeric- vermilion, bangles and sari to the Mother Goddess across the temples. Bonalu involves the worship of Mother Goddess in regional forms like Maisamma, Pochamma, Yellamma, Peddhamma, Dokkalamma, Ankalamma, Poleramma, Maremma, Nookalamma. Origin of Bonalu festival The origin of this festival can be traced back to the 18th Century in the erstwhile Hyderabad State, and is linked with the \\"Regimental Bazaar\\" and the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. In the year 1813, plague broke out in the twin cities, and this took the lives of thousands of people. Just before this, a military battalion from Hyderabad was deployed to Ujjain. When this military battalion from Hyderabad got to know about the epidemic in the twin cities, they prayed to the Mother Goddess in Mahakali Temple - Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. The battalion supposedly prayed to Goddess Mahakali to kill the plague, and if the goddess did so, they would install an idol of the Goddess Mahakali in the city. It is believed that Mahkali destroyed the disease and kept the pestilence away. Then, the battalion returned to the city and installed an idol of the goddess, which was followed by the offering of Bonalu to her. This then became a tradition that has been followed by most of the people of Telangana. There are also other versions regarding the origin of the festival. This include the mythological story that this is the time when Goddess Mahakali comes back to her parental home, during Ashada Maasam or the period from late June to August, which makes this period the most optimal time to offer Bonalu to the goddess. This practice is comparable to the treatment meted to a married daughter who returns to her parents' home each year for a vacation and is pampered by her parents. The Ritual Bonalu is celebrated in various parts of the twin cities. In Hyderabad, on the first Sunday of Aashadham, celebrations are held at the temple at Golconda Fort. On the second Sunday, at Balkampet Yellamma temple in Balkampet and Ujjaini Mahakali Temple in Secunderabad, and on the third Sunday, at the Pochamma and Katta Maisamma temple of Chilkalguda and the Matheswari temple of Lal Darwaza in the Old City of Hyderabad. Akkanna Madanna temple in Haribowli, and Muthyalamma temple in Shah Ali Banda are among other temples where Bonalu is celebrated. Every year, lakhs of devotees congregate to pay obeisance to Mahakali. On this special occasion, women dress up in the traditional Sari, jewels and other accessories. Teenage girls wear half Saris/Lehenga Choli, and ornaments to bring out the traditional grace of the attire. Some Tranced women dance with balancing pots (Bonam), to the rhythmic beats of drums in honour of the local goddess. To ward off evil spirits, in olden days, people used to sacrifice a male buffalo in front of the temple, but now it is replaced with the sacrifice of roosters. Golconda Women carrying Bonalu are believed to possess the spirit of Mother Goddess, and when they go towards the temple, people pour water on their feet to pacify the spirit, who is believed to be aggressive. Every group of devotees offer a Thottelu (a small colorful, paper structure supported by sticks), as a mark of respect to the goddess. The Bonalu celebrations at \\"Lashkar\\" Secunderabad is one of the most prominent Bonalu celebrations. The festival begins on the first Sunday of the Hindu Month of Ashada which is known as Edurukolu, which is celebrated as the homecoming of the goddess in the form of Ghatam. On the third Sunday of the Ashada month, Bonalu Jatara is celebrated, and on the following Monday, Rangam (Oracle) and Ghatam Saganamputa are celebrated, when the festivities come to an end. The prominent temples in the Secunderabad \\"Lashkar Bonalu\\" include Sri Ujjaini Mahakali Devasthanam, Sri Gandimaissamma Temple, Sri Devi Pochamma Temple, Sri Muthyalamma Temple, Sri Peddamma Temple, Sri Dokkalamma Temple, Sri Muthyalamma Temple, and Sri Peenugula Mallanna Temple, among others. Out of these temples, Sri Ujjaini Mahakali Temple, and Sri Devi Pochamma Temple are government temples, government officials and legislators also visit and take part in the festivities. Certain areas like Gunfoundry, and Kalasiguda celebrate Bonalu in the Sravanam month, unlike other parts of the city which celebrates in the month of Ashadam. Gunfoundry Muthyalamma Temple is the one temple which has an almost two century old tradition. The tradition consists of two days festivals, with the first day of the festival with Bonam given to deities from various devotees, known as the Thotela procession, followed by the Ghatam procession, and concluding with Ori (village) Bonam by the trustees on behalf the devotees. On the second day, events like Rangam, Kallu Ghatam, Sare Gampa procession, and Gavurangam (Potharaju) take place, concluding the event by sending off the Ghatam procession. Pothuraju A woman under trance According to mythology, Potharaju the brother of the Mother Goddess. His role is played in the procession by a well-built, bare-bodied man, wearing a small tightly draped red dhoti, bells on his ankles, and anointed with turmeric on his body and vermilion on his forehead. He dances to resounding drums in the procession. Potharaju always dances in front of the Palaharam Bandi, i.e, the procession. He is considered the initiator of the festivities and the protector of the community. He leads the female dancers who are under the spell of the Mother Goddess (known as shigam) to the temple, with lashing whips and emerald neem leaves (margosa) tied around their waists, accompanied by trumpets and drums. The Feast Bonalu is a festival of offering to the Mother Goddess, and families share the offering with family members and guests. A non-vegetarian family feast follows after the great offering. The meat used to prepare the meal is the meat of a goat or a rooster, that has been ceremonially slaughtered, and later partaken as a meal. Peasants take whatever food they can as a display of affection to the earth goddess and eat it later. Toddy (palm wine) workers also offer toddy which they tap for their livelihood. There is no special scriptural mandate on what has to be offered. As per tradition, offerings are made to the goddess which consists of toddy, along with fowls, sheep and goat. Animals killed for community meals are not considered sacrifices. There are no scriptural books that prescribe the peasant-tradition, that the Mother Goddess demands meat as an offering. The tradition of this peasant festival is similar to the Islamic Bakrid tradition, where a goat is slaughtered and consumed. Western and Brahmin literature confuses animals consumed in festival time for communal meals in peasant tradition with the sacrifices of Rig Vedic Brahmins, where animals were killed by fire priests, not for consumption but for ritual reasons. However, with the advent of modernization and government control over peasant traditions, people have been restricted to only use pumpkins, bottle gourds, coconuts and lemons. The festive environment is quite palpable in the locality celebrating the festival, with loud-speakers playing folk songs and such other songs in respect of the Mother Goddess, and the streets decorated with neem leaves. Rangam Rangam (or Performing the Oracle), is held the next morning of the festival. A woman standing atop of an earthen pot invokes Goddess Mahakali onto her and performs the custom. She foretells the year ahead for the devotees asking about the future. This takes place before the procession is started. The present oracle at Sri Ujjaini Mahakali Devasthanam and other major temples of Secunderabad is Kumari Erupula Swarnalatha, who is currently the 6th generation oracle. Previous oracles include Kumari's elder sister Kum, Swaroopa before her, her grandmother Bagamma and other ancestors including Jogamma and Poshamma. Ghatam Ghatam is a copper pot, decorated in the form of the Mother Goddess. The Ghatam is carried by a priest, who wears a traditional Dhoti, and whose body is smeared with turmeric. The Ghatam is taken into procession from the first day of the festival until the last day when it is immersed in water. The Ghatam is usually accompanied by beating of drums. The festival concludes with immersion of the Ghatam. The Ghatam of Haribowli's Akkanna Madanna Temple leads the procession, placed atop an elephant and accompanied by mounted horses and models depicting Akkanna and Madanna. It ends in the evening with a glittering procession and display of much pomp and show followed by immersion of Ghatams at Nayapul. The festival has a carnival-like atmosphere, where thousands of people wait along the main streets of Laldarwaza to Nayapul and watch the exquisitely and elaborately decorated Ghatams. Young men dance in a unique style to the drum beats and folk songs alongside Pothuraju, and dress-up in various mythological roles. The Ghatams of the Secunderabad City (Lashkar) include Ujjaini Mahakali & Mahadevi Pochamma at Karbala Maidan, Dokkalamma at Himam Bavi, Muthyalamma at Kalasiguda, Nallagutta, Pan Bazar, Chilkalguda, Uppara Basthi, Kummariguda, Regimental Bazar and Bhoiguda, etc. Areas in Secunderabad that existed from the British Colonial era have their own dates for celebrating Bonalu in their villages like Mudfort, Gunrock, and Sikh Village. They celebrate the Ghatam procession for one or two days, depending on their traditions. Thiru thulkanthamman Temple in Old Mudfort has been celebrating Ghatam for about 100 years. The Ghatams of the Old City procession include the Mahankali temples in Haribowli Akkanna-Madanna, Lal Darwaza, Uppuguda, Miralam Mandi and Kasaratta, the Jagadamba temple of Sultanshahi, Bangaru Mysamma temple of Shah Ali Banda, Alijah Kotla and Gowlipura, and Sultanshahi, Darbar Mysamma of Aliabad, Mysamma Temple of Boggulkunta and Mutyalamma temple of Chandulal Bela. Certain areas like Gunfoundry and Kalasiguda celebrate Bonalu in the Sravanam month, unlike other parts of the city that celebrates in the month of Ashadam. In Gunfoundry Muthyalamma Temple, there is a two-century-old tradition, where there are two days festivities with the traditional rituals. Thottela Another part of the Bonalu festival is Thottela, whereby an artifact is offered to the goddess by the people of Telangana. This artifact (called Thottela) is made of bamboo sticks and colorful transparent papers.

The route exists entirely within Outagamie County. Highway 15 provides a \\"shortcut\\" to Appleton from U.S. Highway 45 for travelers inbound from points north and west. Most of it was once part of US 45, which was redirected south of New London to bypass Appleton and provide direct access to Oshkosh and points south. Route description WIS 15 begins at the junction of US 45 and CTH T southeast of New London as a two-lane road and heads southeast to Hortonville. The route then continues southeast into Greenville where it becomes a multilane expressway just northwest of the village. The highway intersects WIS 76 in Greenville then continues southeast for one mile (1.6 km) before turning east at the junction with CTH CB. WIS 15 then junctions with US 41 where it ends and Northland Ave and CTH OO begins in the town of Grand Chute, just northwest of Appleton. The route between US 45 and Industrial Park Avenue west of Hortonville and from Greendale Rd east of Hortonville to Julius Drive west of Greenville now has centerline rumble strips. WIS 15 provides access to Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium. History East terminus Looking easterly from the western terminus This is the third iteration of the route number. The first iteration followed present day US 41 from the Illinois border to Marinette via Milwaukee, Fond du Lac, Appleton and Green Bay. The second is the more well-known alignment following the present day Interstate 43 from the Hale Interchange in Milwaukee to Interstate 90 in Beloit as the Rock Freeway. From the Hale Interchange, This iteration followed Interstate 894 northward then turned east onto National Avenue and ending in downtown Milwaukee. Previously, the current Highway 15 route was US 45 - which turned south at its intersection with WIS 76. WIS 76 continued straight on to intersect with Wisconsin Avenue (then U.S. Highway 10) at the north entrance road to the Fox River Mall in Appleton. The road was realigned as part of a large project that realigned US 10 and US 45. Essentially, the road south of Greenville became an extension of WIS 76 and Highway 15 is now the sole route number on the current stretch. Major intersections Future The highway is currently being studied for expansion by WisDOT. This includes possible bypass options of Hortonville and capacity expansion.

It is a female trio of Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music alumni who graduated in 2003. The band made their performing debut in December 2003, at Meguro Gajoen, and in April 2004, their first single, called Sakitama, was released by avex trax. Chie Arai and Mana Yoshinaga play koto, sangen, and jushichi-gen, while Tomoca Nagasu plays biwa and shakuhachi. All three perform vocals. According to the band's website, the name Rin' comes from the English word 'ring', the Japanese word Wa (和, meaning both 'ring' and 'Japanese- style'), and from the trio's hope to create a 'ring', or circle, of music. Since their debut, the band has performed in many venues around the world, and have released four singles and several albums. A number of their songs have been used as themes for anime and movies, most notable is Fuhen used in the Samurai 7 anime. Their chief international album, Inland Sea, was released worldwide: in Europe and the United States on April 25, 2006 and in Japan on August 30, 2006, featuring guest performances by Leigh Nash and Lisa Loeb.

The Halqemeylem name for the mountain is Lhílheqey – Theeth-uhl-kay – from the word Lhelqey – \\"glacier\\" or \\"rehydrate\\",BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Cheam Peak\\" referring to the west ridge of the peak). Description Mount Cheam in January as seen from the Fraser Valley. Cheam's structure is pyramidal, with north, northwest, south and east faces. While the north face is the steepest, the northwest face is also sheer. A prominent spur ending in the sub peak called \\"Red Pyramid\\" or \\"Red Tower\\" () divides the two northern faces. The western ridge divides the northwest and south faces; below the gently sloping south face is the subalpine bowl of Spoon Lake. The southeast ridge ascends from the col with Lady Peak, two km to the southeast; Jones Lake is below the east face. A sharp ridge divides the east and north faces. Cheam is the farthest northerly peak of a small group of peaks forming a local subrange, the Cheam Range, a small group of peaks forming a local subrange of the Skagit Range of the Canadian Cascades mountains (which are the Canadian extension of the North Cascades of Washington). It dominates the eastern Fraser Valley, rising above Bridal Falls and Agassiz just east of Chilliwack, British Columbia. It and three sister peaks form a group known as the Four Sisters or Four Brothers, which are part of the mountain wall framing the Lower Mainland; though visible from as far away as Vancouver Island on a clear day, like Cheam does for the Eastern Valley, they are a dominant part of the mountain skyline of Mission and the communities of Hatzic, Dewdney and Deroche. Behind them is Wahleach Lake, which begins at the east foot of Cheam and lies in a high-altitude valley ringed by the Cheam Range. The far east ridge of Cheam is not alpine and is heavily forested and is pierced by the BC Hydro diversion tunnel to Wahleach Powerhouse, which is in the area of the Trans-Canada Highway that Cheam first becomes visible coming from the east. A few miles east along the highway the highway's course diverts around the foot of another mountain. History Cheam Peak was part of the oral history of the Sto:lo peoples. The Halkomelem name for the peak, Theeth-uhl-kay, means \\"the source\\" or \\"the place from which the waters spring.\\" For the Sto:lo, the peak is the \\"mother mountain\\" or old woman overlooking her children dwelling in the valley. Lady Peak, to the south is the old woman's dog. Cheam, the official name of the peak, is said to be the Halkomelem word for \\"wild strawberries,\\" though the British Columbia Geographical Names Office description says that name is a reference to the lowland below. This describes the ridge that includes Cheam and Lady Peaks, and the lower slopes around Spoon Lake and upper Airplane Creek. The first recorded ascent of the mountain was in 1888 by A. O. Campbell, Ebe B. Knight and party. Climbing history The north face, plunging to the valley floor, has rarely been climbed. However, an easy trail provides access to the summit from a subalpine bowl to the southwest. Hiking The trailhead to Cheam Peak, is via decommissioned logging roads accessible from Chilliwack Lake Road on the south side of Cheam. Access without a four-wheel drive vehicle is difficult but possible. From the trailhead, a trail leads through subalpine meadows and then ascends, moderately steeply, to the peak. The summit offers views of the Fraser Valley to the north and west and of the Cheam Range and North Cascade mountains to the south. One can also access Lady Peak via a route that begins about halfway up the Cheam Peak Trail. Mount Cheam as seen from Lady Peak Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Cheam Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Cheam Peak.

History  Barringer Slough in Iowa, a remnant of the extensive prairie wetlands that once covered the region. In the 1930s James Ford Bell, sportsman and founder of General Mills, purchased 5,000 acres (20 km²) of the Delta Marsh in Manitoba, Canada. For several years Bell hunted waterfowl on the marsh in the fall and raised and released waterfowl in the spring and summer from a privately owned hatchery. In 1938, Bell approached Aldo Leopold, who is considered to be the father of wildlife management in the United States, about establishing a research station dedicated to waterfowl research at the Delta Marsh, as very little was known at that time about waterfowl biology. After some discussion, Aldo Leopold agreed to Bell's idea and brought in his graduate student, Hans Albert Hochbaum, from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Hochbaum completed his graduate work at the Delta Marsh on canvasback ducks and continued on to become the Scientific Director of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station.  Today  Today Delta Waterfowl Foundation supports graduate research on waterfowl (Master's degree and Ph.D.) along with other programs focused on waterfowl populations and waterfowl hunting in North America. Delta Waterfowl has a program focused on reviving the duck population of the Great Lakes region through wetlands advocacy, applied research, duck production programs, youth hunting education, and promoting hunting rights and trapping.

It was constructed as the McCalls Ferry Dam between 1905 and 1910 by the Pennsylvania Water & Power (PW&P;) Company. The dam was renamed Holtwood in honor of two company executives. PW&P; merged with Pennsylvania Power & Light (PPL) in 1955. In 2015 Talen Energy took over PPL's generation and immediately sold the Holtwood plant to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners to comply with federal antitrust requirements. Holtwood hydroelectric plant The Holtwood Hydroelectric Plant produces 252 Megawatts of power, using 14 turbine driven generators. The dam consists of a main concrete dam, which is mostly one continuous spillway, with a power house at the eastern end. The water level is raised by wooden flash boards and inflatable dam sections. The western end of the dam has the original, and ineffective, fish ladder. In the mid 1990s, construction started on a fish lift. The fish lift and dam were damaged by heavy rain and rapid snowmelt from the severe 1996 flood in January of that year. The new fish lift was completed in time for the 1997 season and began lifting american shad and other migratory fish species. The Kingsbury thrust bearing of Holtwood's Generator No. 5 is designated an International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. Previously used roller bearings would last about 2 months under the generator's 220 ton load, but the Kingsbury bearing has been in use since 1912. The impounded water, Lake Aldred, was originally dredged for anthracite coal silt, or fines, washed downstream from the Coal Region of Pennsylvania. This coal was used in the adjacent Holtwood Steam Generator station. When Safe Harbor Dam was built upstream, its impoundment was then \\"mined\\" for coal as well. More efficient primary mining upstream reduced the availability of fines, and 1972 environmental laws made the dredging impractical, so coal was brought in by train. Expansion project In 2008, PPL announced plans to expand the plant with a second powerhouse. PPL received the approval to add the second powerhouse in November 2009 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Expansion of the plant started in 2010. Preliminary construction began in January 2010, with full construction beginning in April 2010. The project was completed in December 2013. The second powerhouse added 125 MW of additional capacity, increasing total generating capacity to more than 230 megawatts. One worker was killed during construction of the second powerhouse. Bruce Hardy, 59, of Bainbridge, Lancaster County, died after being crushed between a wall and an excavator bucket. The area below the dam is popular with whitewater kayakers, with eleven named hydraulic features. Scheduled whitewater releases from the dam are made, when conditions permit.

Payne. Frontispiece of Recollections of Seventy Years (1888) Daniel Alexander Payne (February 24, 1811 – November 2, 1893) was an American bishop, educator, college administrator and author. A major shaper of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (A.M.E.), Payne stressed education and preparation of ministers and introduced more order in the church, becoming its sixth bishop and serving for more than four decades (1852-1893) as well as becoming one of the founders of Wilberforce University in Ohio in 1856. In 1863 the AME Church bought the college and chose Payne to lead it; he became the first African-American president of a college in the United States and served in that position until 1877. By quickly organizing AME missionary support of freedmen in the South after the Civil War, Payne gained 250,000 new members for the AME Church during the Reconstruction era. Based first in Charleston, he and his missionaries founded AME congregations in the South down the East Coast to Florida and west to Texas. In 1891 Payne wrote the first history of the AME Church, a few years after publishing his memoir. Early life and education Daniel Payne was born free in Charleston, South Carolina, on February 24, 1811, of African, European and Native American descent. Daniel stated \\"as far as memory serves me my mother was of light- brown complexion, of middle stature and delicate frame. She told me that her grandmother was of the tribe of Indians known in the early history of the Carolinas as the Catawba Indians.\\" He also stated that he descended from the Goings family, who were a well known free colored/Native American family. His father was one of six brothers who served in the Revolutionary War and his paternal grandfather was an Englishmen.http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/payne70/payne.html His parents London and Martha Payne were part of the \\"Brown Elite\\" of free blacks in the city.\\"Daniel Payne\\", This Far by Faith, PBS, 2003, retrieved January 13, 2009 Both died before he reached maturity. While his great-aunt assumed Daniel's care, the Minors' Moralist Society assisted his early education.Payne, Daniel, Recollections of Seventy Years, Ayer (reprint), 1991, pp. 11–15 Payne was raised in the Methodist Church like his parents. He also studied at home, teaching himself mathematics, physical science, and classical languages. In 1829, at the age of 18, he opened his first school. After the Nat Turner Rebellion of 1831, South Carolina and other southern states passed legislation restricting the rights of free people of color and slaves. They enacted a law on April 1, 1835, which made teaching literacy to free people of color and slaves illegal and subject to fines and imprisonment.Payne, Daniel. Recollections of Seventy Years {1888], Ayer (reprint), 1991, pp. 27–28 With the passage of this law, Payne had to close his school. In May 1835, Payne sailed from Charleston to Philadelphia in search of further education. Declining the Methodists' offer, which was contingent on his going on a mission to Liberia, established as a colony for free blacks from the United States, Payne studied at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. Payne never worked as a Lutheran priest. One source claims he had to drop out of school because of problems with his eyesight.Campbell, James T., Songs of Zion: The African Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States and South Africa, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 37, retrieved January 13, 2009 Another source claimed no congregation called him and the Lutheran Church told him to work through the Methodist Episcopal Church.Gelberding, C.H., Life and Letters of W. A. Passavant, D. D., Illinois Historical Society, 1909 at https://archive.org/stream/lifelettersofwap00gerb/lifelettersofwap00gerb_djvu.txt at p. 529 et seq. Marriage and family Payne married in 1847, but his wife died during the first year of marriage from complications of childbirth. In 1854, he married again, to Eliza Clark of Cincinnati. Career in AME Church By 1840, Payne started another school. He joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) in 1842. He agreed with the founder, Richard Allen, that a visible and independent black denomination was a strong argument against slavery and racism. Payne always worked to improve the position of blacks within the United States; he opposed calls for their emigration to Liberia or other parts of Africa, as urged by the American Colonization Society and supported by some free blacks. Payne worked to improve education for AME ministers, recommending a wide variety of classes, including grammar, geography, literature and other academic subjects, so they could effectively lead the people. In the ensuing decades' debates about \\"order and emotionalism\\" in the African Methodist Church, he sided consistently with order.Campbell, James T., Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 39, retrieved January 13, 2009 The AME's first task was \\"to improve the ministry; the second to improve the people\\".Campbell, James T., Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 38, retrieved January 13, 2009 At a denominational meeting in Baltimore in 1842, Payne recommended a full program of study for ministers, to include English grammar, geography, arithmetic, ancient history, modern history, ecclesiastical history, and theology. At the 1844 AME General Conference, he called for a \\"regular course of study for prospective ordinees\\", in the belief they would lift up their parishioners. In 1845 Payne established a short-lived AME seminary, and succeeded in gradually raising the educational preparation required for ministers. Payne also directed reforms at the style of music, introducing trained choirs and instrumental music to church practice. He supported the requirement that ministers be literate. Payne continued throughout his career to build the institution of the church, establishing literary and historic societies and encouraging order. At times he came into conflict with those who wanted to ensure that ordinary people could advance in the church. Especially after expansion of the church in the South, where different styles of worship had prevailed, there were continuing tensions about the direction of the denomination.Campbell, James T., Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 43–47, retrieved January 13, 2009 =Bishop and college president= In 1848, Bishop William Paul Quinn named Payne as the historiographer of the AME Church. In 1852, Payne was elected and consecrated the sixth bishop of the AME denomination. He served in that position for the rest of his life. Together with Lewis Woodson and two other African Americans representing the AME Church, and 18 European-American representatives of the Cincinnati Methodist Episcopal Conference, Payne served on the founding board of directors of Wilberforce University in Ohio in 1856.James T. Campbell, Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 259–260, 263, accessed 13 January 2009 Among the trustees who supported the abolitionist cause and African-American education was Salmon P. Chase, then governor of Ohio, who was appointed as Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court by President Abraham Lincoln.Payne, Daniel, Recollections of Seventy Years, Ayer (reprint), 1991, p. 226 The denominations jointly sponsored Wilberforce in 1856 to provide collegiate education to African Americans. It was the first historically black college in which African Americans were part of the founding.Campbell, James T., Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 259–260, retrieved 13 January 2009 Wilberforce was located at what had been a popular summer resort, called Tawawa Springs. It was patronized by people from Cincinnati, including abolitionists, as well as many white planters from the South, who often brought their mistresses of color and \\"natural\\" (illegitimate) multi-racial children with them for extended stays. In one of the paradoxical results of slavery, by 1860 most of the college's more than 200 paying students were mixed-race offspring of wealthy southern planters, who gave their children the education in Ohio which they could not get in the South.Talbert (1906), Sons of Allen, p. 267 The men were examples of white fathers who did not abandon their mixed-race children, but passed on important social capital in the form of education; they and others also provided money, property and apprenticeships. With the Civil War, the planters withdrew their sons from the college, and the Cincinnati Methodist Conference felt it needed to use its resources to support efforts related to the war. The college had to close temporarily because of these financial difficulties. In 1863, Payne persuaded the AME Church to buy the debt and take over the college outright. Payne was selected as president, the first African-American college president in the United States. The AME had to reinvest in the college two years later, when a southern sympathizer damaged buildings by fire. Payne helped organize fundraising and rebuilding. White sympathizers gave large donations, including $10,000 donations each from founding board member Salmon P. Chase and a supporter from Pittsburgh, as well as $4200 from a white woman. The US Congress passed a $25,000 grant for the college to aid in rebuilding.Horace Talbert, The Sons of Allen: Together with a Sketch of the Rise and Progress of Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio, 1906, p. 273, Documenting the South, 2000, University of North Carolina, accessed Jul 25, 2008 Payne led the college until 1877. Payne traveled twice to Europe, where he consulted with other Methodist clergy and studied their education programs. In April 1865, after the Civil War, Payne returned to the South for the first time in 30 years. Knowing how to build an organization, he took nine missionaries and worked with others in Charleston to establish the AME denomination. He organized missionaries, committees and teachers to bring the AME church to freedmen. A year later, the church had grown by 50,000 congregants in the South. By the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877, AME congregations existed from Florida to Texas, and more than 250,000 new adherents had been brought into the church. While it had a northern center, the church was strongly influenced by its expansion in the South. The incorporation of many congregants with different practices and traditions of worship and music styles helped shape the national church. It began to reflect more of the African-American culture of the South.Campbell, James T., Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 53–54, retrieved January 13, 2009 In 1881, he founded the Bethel Literary and Historical Society, a club which invited speakers to present on topics relevant to African-American life and a part of the Lyceum movement.

History Grace Hospital began as a mission of the Episcopal Church. In 1901, the Rev. Walter Hughson and his wife, Mary Herbert Hughson, moved to Morganton where Rev. Hughson served as rector of Grace Episcopal Church. The church hired Miss Maria Purdon Allen from Philadelphia in 1903 as visiting nurse to the missions. After Miss Allen wrote an article in a national church publication, “The Spirit of the Missions,” about the need for a hospital in the area which she believed could be built for $3,000, friends and strangers began sending money for the project. Mrs. George Zabriskie Gray of New York sent $3,000 in memory of her daughter Grace then another $2,000 of which $1,000 was designated to build a ward for African-Americans. Rev. Hughson took charge of the project, and the first Grace Hospital was built on King Street in Morganton across from the Episcopal rectory. The hospital opened on Aug. 1, 1906, with two white wards, one male and one female, with four beds each and a crib and an annex for black patients with two wards of four beds each. The hospital had an operating room and a dispensary. Mrs. Hughson became the first superintendent of the hospital and devoted considerable time and energy to improving the institution's finances and facilities. Kathy C.

A true model of mid-century Urbanism, Westover remains a pedestrian friendly neighborhood which sees its residents walk to shops, work, and public transportation. The neighborhood is between the Ballston Station and the East Falls Church Stations, both part of the Washington DC Metro and is serviced by many Metro Buses. History During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the area that was to become Westover was agricultural in nature, not unlike much of what is now Arlington County at the time. In the mid-nineteenth century, the property was owned by Nicholas Febrey, a civic leader in Arlington and one of the largest landholders in the area. In the 1890s, small communities began to develop along newly established electric railways which serviced the area, as real estate developers began subdividing the land.C.B. Rose, Jr., Arlington Virginia, A History (Arlington, Virginia: Arlington Historical Society, 1976) One such community was Fostoria, developed by the Fostoria Land and Development Company in 1890, which took advantage of the Washington, Arlington, and Falls Church Electric Railway. The railroad provided passenger service from Rosslyn to East Falls Church and ran along Four Mile Run.Map of Alexandria County, Virginia for the Virginia Title Co., 1900 By 1907, the neighborhood was known as Highland Park - the earliest houses constructed in the Westover area are located within this community.G.M. Hopkins' Atlas of Fifteen Miles Around Washington, D.C., 1878. Nan Netherton, Donald Sweig, Janice Artemel, Patricia Hickin, and Patrick Reed, Fairfax County, Virginia: A History, commemorative ed. (Fairfax County, Virginia: Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, 1991) Westover Baptist Church A measure of the development in the area at the time, the Walter Reed Elementary School was constructed in 1938 on McKinley Road, originally a section of Febrey farmland. Though Westover had seen significant development over the previous half century, in 1938, when the school was constructed, the area was still largely undeveloped.\\"New School Dedicated at Highland Park,\\" The Washington Post, 19 November 1938 By that time, most of Westover was owned primarily by Ashton C. Jones and his wife, Margaret Rucker. Jones deeded the land to the local development company, Mace Properties, Inc., which was owned by Miles A. Mace. In turn, Mace Properties developed the majority of the buildings located in what is now the Westover Historic District between 1939 and 1948.Ames and McClelland, \\"Historic Residential Suburbs\\" Following the principles set forth by the FHA and responding to the need for affordable housing, Mace developed several neighborhoods in Arlington County in the early twentieth century which provided economical housing to the growing population. Mace, who lived in Arlington County, was a real estate broker.According to the 1930 United States Census, Mace lived on Glebe Road with his wife, father, mother, and mother-in- law He was just twenty-six years old when he began to play a role in developing the community of Over-Lee Knolls—adjacent to Westover to the northwest and today considered part of greater Westover. The Over-Lee Knolls neighborhood was advertised in 1926 as \\"Virginia's Ideal Suburb\\" which emphasized value and quality construction.The Washington Post, 10 October 1926 In October 1938, Arlington County approved the rezoning of , which allowed Mace Properties to construct large multi-family apartment buildings.\\"Arlington Zone Changed for Big Apartments,\\" The Washington Post, 30 October 1938. In April 1939, Mace Properties announced that it had received FHA approval for low-cost multi-family rental housing. The first of these constructed was a 152 unit garden-style apartment building which cost Mace a total cost of $600,000 to build. In 1940, the FHA-backed Westover Hills project was announced. Westover Hills was hailed as the \\"most ambitious building program in Mace Properties' [sic] history.\\" The dwellings, including single-family houses, twin houses, and garden apartments, were designed by Thelander and Washington, D.C. architect Harry E. Ormston.\\"Westover Hills New Arlington Home Project,\\" The Washington Post, 16 June 1940 During 1940, the Westover Shopping Center was constructed—a 13-store retail center along Washington Boulevard between Longfellow and McKinley Streets.The Arlington Journal, February 2, 1978 The shopping center initially included a Safeway grocery store,Arlington Sun February 7, 1941 a \\"five and dime\\" store, and a pharmacy. In 1958, county planners noted that the center's \\"retail sales per store [were] higher... than in any of the five nearby competing neighborhood or community centers.Advance Planning Section of the Arlington County Office of Planning, A Study of the Westover Shopping Center, April 1958 \\" However, by the late seventies, the center's physical condition and sales had declined. In 1978, the Arlington County Board allocated $50,000 in business and neighborhood conservation funds to supplement $250,000 worth of exterior renovation work planned by the center's owners.The Arlington News, February 16, 1978 Today, Westover is a residential suburban community and its overall character remains predominately unchanged. The shopping center continues to provide a mix of retail offerings to the community. Residences in the neighborhood are still composed mostly of modest, pre-World War II single family homes and garden style apartment complexes such as the Westover Apartments. Like those in most older suburban neighborhoods, the dwellings in Westover have been adapted to fit modern-day needs and growing families. In many instances, porches have been enclosed and/or enlarged for additional bathrooms. Transit A woman walks along the East Falls Church Metro station platform Westover has access to many modes of transportation, both public and private. Approximately 22% of people within Westover's Zip Code (22205) use transit other than a private vehicle to get to work The central artery in Westover is Washington Boulevard which serves as a commercial focal point as well as a regional connector. Westover is situated between exits 69 and 71 on Interstate 66. Also close by is the East Falls Church Metro Station, part of the Washington DC Metro's Orange Line. The community is served by MetroBus, via the 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2G lines which run down Washington Boulevard. The Art Bus line 52, an Arlington-provided bus system, also passes through the community, though it does not travel through what many consider to be central Westover - Washington Boulevard between North Mckinley and Longfellow Streets. The Washington & Old Dominion Railroad and Custis multi use trails also pass through Southern Westover, connecting the community to Falls Church to the West and The Rosslyn-Ballston corridor and Washington, D.C. to the East. Buildings =The Reed School= Walter Reed School, circa 1939 Westover is home to the Walter Reed School, built in 1938 and reopened in October 2009 after significant renovations.&NodeID;=1596 It currently serves as a pre-school and public library, having served as an elementary school from 1938 to 1984. The Walter Reed Elementary School was built in 1938 by contractor T. Calvin Owens on what was farmland at the time.Lois Snyderman and the Couture/Denig Paternship, 18 Early-Mid Twentieth Century School Buildings Arlington Virginia, December 1991, pp 325-348 In 1950, the school was expanded and altered. A new 8 classroom wing and mechanical room were added to the rear of the building, while lower level rooms were converted to a library, teachers room, clinic and conference room. To cope with further population growth, in 1966 an octagonal classroom building was constructed. By the 1980s the Reed School building was deemed unsuitable for use as an elementary school according to modern standards. It contained large amounts of asbestos and lead paint, was extremely difficult to heat and cool, and was plagued by problems with mold and excessive humidity. It also was not wheelchair-accessible. Due to the physical problems in the building, declining enrollment, and the view of then-school superintendent Charles M. Nunley, the school ceased functioning as a traditional educational facility in 1984. Because other schools were not walking-distance from Westover, A County-funded study at the time predicted that, within 20 years, Reed would be needed to meet the needs of the projected population. On May 9, 2008, a Groundbreaking Ceremony was held at the Reed School site for the $21.6M Reed School/Westover Library project. The project included tearing down the entire building, with the exception of the original 1938 shell, and rebuilding into a building which houses the new Westover Branch Library and several public pre-school programs. The library reopened on October 31, 2009, having been relocated from its former location approximately one block northeast. By 2010, as predicted, the elementary schools that had absorbed Reed's student population (McKinley and Tuckahoe elementary schools) were the most overcrowded in county, and the county considered expanding Reed to serve as an elementary school again. Due to neighborhood objections and recent construction at the site, a location on the campus of Williamsburg Middle School was chosen instead (Discovery Elementary, which opened in 2015). In 2014, the Reed building was also considered as a new location for the H-B Woodlawn Secondary Program. After neighborhood objection, citing the proximity of another secondary school (Swanson, below) and a new-found desire for a neighborhood elementary school, the district chose another location for H-B Woodlawn. By the fall of 2017 the Arlington School Board had approved construction at the Reed site of a new neighborhood elementary school. The conceptual design for the new school will be approved by the School Board in the spring. The new school is scheduled to open in the fall of 2021.https://www.apsva.us/design-and-construction/new-elementary-school-reed/ =Swanson Middle School= Swanson Middle School Swanson Middle School is located at the intersection of Patrick Henry Drive and Washington Boulevard in Westover. Built in 1939, Swanson is part of the Arlington Historic District and is the oldest operating junior high in Arlington. Originally a 7-9th grade school, it currently serves 6-8th grade students. Swanson Junior High School, built by contractor E. A. Pessagnolo for a cost of $200,941,Arlington County School Board Minutes, Book #2, July 1932-October 1941, p. 341 opened in 1939 on land formerly occupied by the A. Duke Torreyson family farm. In 1955, a large addition off the North side was constructed to add classroom space. In 1963 and 1968, the central courtyard of the original design was filled in via two additions which accommodated a gymnasium, classrooms, a library, and mechanical rooms.Lois Snyderman and the Couture/Denig Paternship, 18 Early-Mid Twentieth Century School Buildings Arlington Virginia, December 1991, pp. 382-398 In 1958, Swanson was the focus of a racial desegregation controversy when it came under court order to admit an African American student. The student was \\"one of seven [plaintiffs] who can attempt to enter white schools under a court order.\\" State officials threatened to shut the school down in the fall to avoid the desegregation.\\"Ike-Almond Conference on Virginia Schools\\", Washington Post, August 7, 1958. Ultimately, integration did not actually take place until 1959, when several African American students were admitted to Stratford Junior High School. Commerce Westover Village, as it is sometimes called, is home to many Arlington institutions: The Lost Dog Cafe, is a pizza and sandwich shop which was established in 1985. Originally a specialty grocery and carry out place called Gourmet Pizza Deli with limited seating, the owners took over adjacent space in the late 1990s and opened a sit down restaurant. It expanded again in 2009. The Lost Dog Cafe is also affiliated with the Lost Dog and Cat Rescue Foundation which was established in 2001. The Lost Dog and Cat Rescue Foundation places an average of 1500 animals annually into permanent homes. It also has another restaurant in the same block called Stray Cat Cafe, which sports a sign on the wall promising \\"Same Day Service Guaranteed.\\" Lebanese Taverna, the original restaurant in the now regionally-popular chain calls Westover home. Westover Farmers Market summer marketThe Westover Farmers Market was established by local residents on the Reed school property adjacent to N. McKinley Road. The market opened in the spring of 2012 with a dozen vendors, primarily farmers. By 2017 this Sunday market, owned and managed by Field to Table, Inc., a Virginia nonprofit corporation, had grown to 30 vendors in the summertime and 25 vendors in the wintertime. The farmers market enables hundreds of families in the west end of Arlington to purchase locally grown seasonal fruits and vegetables year round, as well as a wide range of locally produced foods such as breads, pickles, home canned items, and many ready-to-eat items. The market enhances the already strong sense of community found in the Westover area. http://westoverfarmersmarket.org/ =Westover Shopping Center= The Westover Shopping Center along Washington Boulevard is anchored on the Western end by the Preston King Post Office. Moving Eastward is small a family-owned and run grocery store, Westover Market. Westover Market's \\"Great Wall of Beer\\" is known throughout the Washington Metropolitan area for its selection of over 550 varieties of beer.http://www.westovermarket.com/ J.W.Ayers Variety & Hardware is a family-owned and operated independent hardware, housewares and notions store which opened in 1947. It specializes in keeping in stock items needed in the maintenance of older homes in the area. Further East is Toby's Homemade Ice Cream & Coffee, an ice cream and coffee shop featuring ice cream made on the premises, locally roasted gourmet coffee and a well-used community bulletin board. The Toby's location housed the Westover Bakery for many years, before closing down in the early 1990s. Pete's Barber Shop opened next door in 1968, where Pete Xereas could be seen cutting hair daily through the shop window until his retirement in 2014  the shop remains open under new ownership. Also located in the center is the Forest Inn Bar and Restaurant, a chain pharmacy, and the 2nd location of The Italian Store, a popular Arlington mainstay.

It was the third of five pre-series movies so it may be considered part of the TV series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. In the film, when all the Earth's fire begins to go out, Hercules and Deianeira must go in search for fire to stop the world from becoming frozen. Plot Hercules is walking through a snowy mountain top where he finds a woman in the cold, and goes to help her. He sees Zeus in a cave and a rock closes over the entrance. Hercules turns around and the woman calls out to him and freezes and explodes. Hercules wakes from a dream. He turns over and goes back to sleep. As he sleeps his camp-fire goes out. Next day Hercules and young man are walking through a cave with dead bodies strewn all over. The man tells Hercules that they are all men from his village and that the witch who guards the Fountain of Youth killed them for their youth and strength. At the heart of the cave they find an old woman. Hercules sees she is chained up, and is hit over the head by the man, who is actually a warlock. He says to Hercules he will now have Hercules' strength. Hercules and the warlock fight and the warlock appears invincible, but then Hercules notices a beating heart among the items in the warlock's cave. Hercules rips the warlock's shirt and sees that the heart belongs to the warlock. Hercules takes a knife and plunges it into the heart and kills the warlock. With the warlock now dead, the old woman reverts to her true form, that of a young woman. Hercules frees the woman from her chains and takes some water from the fountain. After this the fountain begins to boil and begins dissolving everything in the cave. Hercules grabs the woman and they leave the cave. Outside the cave Zeus appears and Hercules tells Zeus the water will cure Chiron of his wound. Later Hercules arrives at Chiron's house, he gives him the water and he drinks it. The wound heals, but after a few seconds the wound worsens. Hercules tells him he will find a cure for his wound. Meanwhile, all over the village fires are being inexplicably extinguished. Hercules and Chiron are talking by the fire side and the fire goes out. Hercules realizes that something is amiss. He decides to investigate. He approaches Hera's temple which still has fire. A woman is trying to persuade the priest of the temple to let them light their torches, the priest refuses. Hercules kicks down the door, Hera's priest fight him, he beats them, and lights the torch. Three women appear and tell Hercules that the torch is of no use, because Hera has stolen the Eternal Torch and plans to kill mankind once and for all. Hercules knows that humans cannot survive without fire, and if he does not get the Torch back all life will die. Later on the woman from the temple comes to Chiron, it is revealed she is Deianeira. Chiron says only Hercules can help her and points her the man from the temple. Hercules says they need to talk to Prometheus, so he and Deianeira set off. They find Prometheus frozen, he says that Hera has stolen the Eternal Torch and that Hercules must get it back. Hercules and Deianeira travel onto Mount Aepion, where Hera has the Torch. While traveling, Hercules is attacked by a giant named Antaeus and with the help of Deianeira manages to kill him. As they camp for the night, Hercules reveals to Deianeira that he was the one who accidentally inflicted Chiron's wound. The next day as they are crossing a gorge they arrive at a point where Hera has removed the bridge. Hercules says they can continue if they use the rope which still remains. Deianeira reluctantly agrees. The two finally arrive at Mount Aepion, Hercules walks through the snowy mountain top, just like in his dream. He finds Zeus and Hercules asks him what Hera has done. Zeus says that Hera has put the Torch in the center of a ring of fire, and the fire has the power to kill immortals. Zeus warns Hercules from going through with his plan to get the Torch back. Hercules says he will do it anyway. The two men battle it out and Zeus tells Hercules that he is trying to save him. Hercules asks his father if he cares about humanity, Zeus replies that he does, but he loves Hercules more. Hercules tells Zeus he loves him too. Zeus accepts what Hercules must do, and lets him go. Hercules goes through the fire and retrieves the Torch, he throws it and it lands in Prometheus's home waking him. Fire begins to return. As Hercules lays dying in the circle, Zeus begs Hera not to harm Hercules or he will haunt her for eternity, and even threatening to give up his own immortality. Hera stops the flames and Zeus helps Hercules, who thanks him for saving his life. Before leaving the cage Hercules picks up a stick and makes a torch. Zeus asks if he knows the power of the flames, Hercules acknowledges that he does. Hercules takes the torch to Chiron's house and asks him to step inside a circle of straw. Chiron stands in the center of the circle and Hercules lights the straw with the torch. Chiron drops to his knees and cries out. As the flames die out Chiron exclaims that his wound is healed, the flames had burned away his immortality and healed the wound.

The subject of the poem is the expedition of Heracles and Iolaus against Cycnus, the son of Ares, who challenged Heracles to combat as Heracles was passing through Thessaly. It has been suggested that this epic may reflect anti-Thessalian feeling after the First Sacred War (595–585 BCE): in the epic, a Thessalian hero interfering with the Phocian sanctuary is killed by a Boeotian hero (Heracles), whose mortal father Amphitryon had for allies Locrians and Phocians. This was a pastiche made to be sung at a Boeotian festival at midsummer at the hottest time of the dogstar Sirios.L.H.Jeferry (1976). The Archaic Greece. The Greek city states. 700-500 B.C., p.74 To serve as an introduction, fifty-six lines have been taken from the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women. The late 3rd- and early 2nd-century BCE critic Aristophanes of Byzantium, who considered the Catalogue to be the work of Hesiod, noted the borrowing, which led him to suspect that the Shield was spurious.R. Janko. \\"The Shield of Heracles and the Legend of Cycnus\\". The Classical Quarterly, New Series, 36.1 (1986:38–59), p. 39. The poem takes its cue from the extended description of the shield of Achilles in Iliad xviii, from which it borrows directly, with a single word altered: The Iliad gives enough detail for its hearers to marvel at Hephaestus' workmanship. The Shield of Heracles piles on repetitive description, without gaining added effect: :\\"They were bringing the brides through the streets from their homes, to the loud music of the wedding-hymn and the light of blazing torches. Youths accompanied by flute and lyre were whirling in the dance, and the women had come to the doors of their houses to enjoy the show.\\" (Iliad). :\\"The men were making merry with festivities and dances; some were bringing home a bride to her husband on a well-wheeled car, while the bridalsong swelled high, and the glow of blazing torches held by handmaidens rolled in waves afar. And these maidens went before, delighting in the festival; and after them came frolicsome choirs, the youths singing soft-mouthed to the sound of shrill pipes, while the echo was shivered around them, and the girls led on the lovely dance to the sound of lyres.\\" (Shield of Heracles). The round shield's \\"whole orb shimmered with enamel and white ivory and electrum, and it glowed with shining gold; and there were zones of cyanus drawn upon it.\\" Cyanus denotes a blue low-fired glass-paste or smalt. At the center was a mask of Fear (Phobos) with the staring eyes and teeth of a gorgon. Though Achilles' shield has nothing about it that might mar its function, the shield of Heracles is a tour de force of high relief: the vineyard has \\"shivering leaves and stakes of silver\\" and the snake heads \\"would clash their teeth when Amphitryon's son was fighting\\" and in the ocean vignette the \\"fishes of bronze were trembling.\\" As for \\"the horseman Perseus: his feet did not touch the shield and yet were not far from itvery marvellous to remark, since he was not supported anywhere; for so did the famous Lame One fashion him of gold with his hands.\\" The extravagant description seems to have encouraged rhapsodes to contribute their interpolations, which have been identified and teased apart by modern scholarship.C.F. Russo, Hesiodi Scutum, rev. ed. (Florence) 1965; Friedrich Solmsen, Hesiodi Theogonia, Opera et Dies, Scutum (Oxford) 1970. \\"there can be absolutely no doubt that in places there are epic doublets incorporated into the text,\\" Richard Janko observes (Janko 1986:39). Some similes may strike the careful listener as infelicitous, such as the contrast of glowering with fierce action in \\"fiercely he stared, like a lion who has come upon a body and full eagerly rips the hide with his strong claws...\\" The popularity of The Shield of Heracles in 6th-century BCE Athens may be assessed from instances where H.A. Shapiro detected its presence in Attic vase-painting between ca 565 and ca 480 BCE.H. Shapiro, \\"Herakles and Kyknos\\", American Journal of Archaeology 88 (1984:523–39), notes over 100 surviving representations of Heracles' combat with Kyknos, recounted in the Shield of Heracles, have been identified, the frequency of the depiction tapering off after ca 500 BCE. A calyx-krater by Euphronios depicting the minor episode of Heracles' combat with the Thessalian brigand Kyknos occasioned Shapiro's examination of the myth's creative reworking among Attic vase-painters, who based their imagery of Heracle's shield on the literary model. The likelihood of both oral and literary transmission during the same time is noted by Janko (1986:40). The Shield of Heracles was first printed, included with the complete works of Hesiod, by Aldus Manutius, in Venice, 1495; the text was from Byzantine manuscripts. In modern times several papyri have offered sections of the text, notably a 1st-century papyrus in Berlin (Berlin Papyri, 9774), a 2nd-century papyrus from Oxyrhynchus (Oxyrhynchus Papyri 689), and the 4th-century Rainer Papyrus (L.P. 21–29) at Vienna. There are numerous texts from the 12th to the 15th century. Compare Virgil's \\"Shield of Aeneas\\" (Aeneid viii.617–731) and the much briefer description of Crenaeus' shield in Thebaid ix.332–338. Marcus Mettius Epaphroditus wrote a commentary on the Shield of Heracles in the 1st century CE. References SourcesThe Shield of Heracles: e-text (English translation by Hugh G.

Playing career Selected in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota North Stars, Kaminski only played one game for the North Stars before he was traded to the Quebec Nordiques in exchange for Gaetan Duchesne. After spending several years in the Nordiques organization, principally for their Halifax Citadels AHL team, he was traded to the Washington Capitals prior to the 1993–94 NHL season.

He would play three more seasons in the minors for the Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League before retiring in 1999. Although Kaminski played only 286 games in the AHL, less than four full seasons' worth, he stands in the top 50 in all-time career penalty minutes for the league. Coaching career After retiring from playing, Kaminski moved on to coaching starting as an assistant with the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks in 2000.

Her keel was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (T. B7 D1, MC hull 1335) on 24 November 1943 at South San Francisco, California, by the Belair Shipyard of Barrett and Hilp. She was designated IX-161 on 7 February 1944, launched on 18 February 1944 sponsored by Mrs. S. C. Anderson, and delivered to the Navy at her builder's yard on 31 August 1944. She was placed in service the same day. Service history =World War II, 1944-1945= Towed by , Barite departed San Francisco on 25 September 1944 and entered Pearl Harbor on the morning of 2 October. Clearing that port four days later, again astern of Iroquois, the barge proceeded to Eniwetok. Thence, under tow by the auxiliary ocean tug ATA-124, with as \\"retriever\\" and YMS-276 as escort, Barite reached Ulithi, in the Caroline Islands, on 13 January 1945 and joined the armada of 225 ships present at that advanced base. Barite served at Ulithi as a floating lubricating oil facility into the spring of 1945, when the advent of the typhoon season made it imperative to shift Service Squadron (ServRon) 10's base to locales other than the Western Caroline Islands. Towed thence to Saipan on 15 May, she operated at that island, in the same capacity, as a unit of Service Division 101, a part of ServRon 10. Towed from Saipan on 30 June 1945, Barite was moved to Leyte, where she served through V-J Day. Reassigned from Service Division 101 directly to the parent command, ServRon 10, on 28 August 1945, Barite remained in Philippine waters for the remainder of her naval service. =Post-war activities and sale, 1945-1951= Barite was taken out of service and delivered to the War Shipping Administration at Subic Bay on 5 August 1946, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 August 1946. Subsequently sold to the China-based Asia Development Corporation, the ship was delivered to her purchaser on 23 April 1948. Lloyd's Register of Shipping carried the former Barite through the 1950-1951 editions, after which time she disappeared from the scene.

Born in Nine Mile River, Nova Scotia, the son of James A. Thompson and Jane Thompson, Thompson was educated at a public school by private tutor and graduated from Dalhousie University with a degree of M.D.C.M. in 1898. He went to the Klondike in 1899 where he practiced medicine. In 1902, he was elected to the Yukon Council. Thompson would go on to sit three times in the House of Commons of Canada, always representing the federal constituency of the Yukon. A Conservative, he first sat in the House between 1904 and 1908, taking the seat away from his main rival, former Yukon Commissioner Frederick Tennyson Congdon. The seat had recently been vacated by another former Yukon Commissioner, James Hamilton Ross, because of his appointment to the Senate of Canada. In 1908, Congdon finally received the seat, but Thompson won it back in 1911, and was re-elected in 1917, remaining the MP for Yukon until 1921, when he was succeeded by George Black, yet another Yukon Commissioner.
