The Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 divided the Earth outside Europe into Castilian and Portuguese global territorial hemispheres for exclusive conquest and colonization. Portugal colonized parts of South America (Brazil, Col√≥nia do Sacramento, Uruguay, Guanare, Venezuela), but also made some unsuccessful attempts to colonize North America (Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia in Canada). Settlements in North America Portuguese North America (in present-day Canada); Vaz Dourado, c.1576. Based on the terms defined in the Treaty of Tordesillas, the Portuguese Crown claimed it had territorial rights in the area visited by the Genoese explorer John Cabot in 1497 and 1498 on behalf of the Crown of England. To that end, in 1499 and 1500, the Portuguese mariner Jo√£o Fernandes Lavrador visited the northeast Atlantic coast and Greenland, which accounts for the appearance of \\"Labrador\\" on topographical maps of the period. Subsequently, in 1501 and 1502, the Corte-Real brothers explored and charted Greenland and what is today the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, claiming these lands as part of the Portuguese Empire. Fragmentary evidence also suggests a previous expedition in 1473 by Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real, their father, with other Europeans, to Terra Nova do Bacalhau (Newfoundland of the Codfish) in North America. The possible voyage of 1473 and several other possible pre-Columbian expeditions to North America in the 15th century, mostly from the Azores in the case of the Portuguese (included in donation royal letters), remain matters of great controversy for scholars. Their existence is based on brief or fragmentary historical documents that are unclear concerning the destinations of voyages. In 1506, King Manuel I of Portugal created taxes for the cod fisheries in Newfoundland waters. Jo√£o √Ålvares Fagundes and P√™ro de Barcelos established fishing outposts in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia around 1521. These were later abandoned, however, when Portuguese colonizers began to focus their efforts mainly on South America. Nonetheless, the Portuguese-founded towns of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, St. Peter's, St. John's, Conception Bay and surrounding areas of east Canada remains important as a cultural region, even today. Colonization of Brazil In 1549, the Captaincy Colonies of Brazil were united into the Governorate General of Brazil, where they were provincial captaincies of Brazil; Lu√≠s Teixeira, 1574. In April 1500, the second Portuguese India Armada, headed by Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and Nicolau Coelho, encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large \\"volta do mar\\" to avoid becalming in the Gulf of Guinea. On 21 April 1500, a mountain was seen that was named Monte Pascoal, and on 22 April, Cabral landed on the coast, in Porto Seguro. Believing the land to be an island, he named it Ilha de Vera Cruz (Island of the True Cross).N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492‚Äì1700. p. 75. The previous expedition of Vasco da Gama to India already recorded several signs of land near its western open Atlantic Ocean route, in 1497. It has also been suggested that Duarte Pacheco Pereira may have discovered the coasts of Brazil in 1498, possible its northeast, but the exact area of the expedition and the explored regions remain unclear. On the other hand, some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the \\"volta do mar\\" (in the Southwest Atlantic), hence the insistence of King John II in moving the line west of the line agreed upon in the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494.Crow 1992, p. 136. From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Landing in the New World and reaching Asia, the expedition connected four continents for the first time in history. Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415-1580, Bailey Wallys Diffie and George D. Winius - Page 187, University of Minnesota Press, 1977 In 1501‚Äì1502, an expedition led by Gon√ßalo Coelho (or Andr√© Gon√ßalves and/or Gaspar de Lemos), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day Rio de Janeiro. Among his crew was the Florentine Amerigo Vespucci. According to Vespucci, the expedition reached the latitude \\"South Pole elevation 52¬∞ S\\" in the \\"cold\\" latitudes of what is now Patagonia, near the Strait of Magellan, before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest-south, following \\"a long, unbending coastline\\". This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter (stating that around 32¬∞ S, they made a shift to open sea, to south-southeast), maintaining, however, that they reached a similar 50¬∞ S latitude.

Leo Bagrow, Stokholm - New light on Vespucci\`s third voyage, By R. Levillier pp. 40-45 Amerigo Vespucci participated as observer in four Spanish and Portuguese exploratory voyages. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504. His last two voyages to the east and southern east coasts of South America, by Portugal, especially the expedition of 1501-1502 to Brazil and beyond, and its meeting with Cabral\`s ships and men (who had touched the South American, African and Asian continents) on the African coast, at Bezeguiche (the bay of Dakar, Senegal), listening the accounts of its sailors (then returning to Portugal), were the most decisive for his \\"New World\\" hypothesis. Vespucci suggested that the newly discovered lands (especially what is today South America/Brazil) were not the Indies but a \\"New World\\",Arciniegas 1978, pp. 295-300. the Mundus novus, Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, which had become widely popular in Europe.Diffie 1977, pp. 458. Around 1508 or 1511-1512, Portuguese captains reached and explored the River Plate estuary in the present-day Uruguay and Argentina, and went as far south as the present-day Gulf of San Matias at 42¬∞S (recorded in the Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt meaning \\"New Tidings from the Land of Brazil\\"). Some historians have attributed this voyage to Coelho and Vespucci years before, but a good part of historians and researchers, through the sparse and comparative documentation, identify the captains and the experienced pilot of the India run (\\"the best Pilot of Portugal\\" and a \\"best friend\\" of the Fugger's Agent), with Diogo Ribeiro, Estev√£o Frois and the pilot Jo√£o de Lisboa. The explorers also reported that after going by the 40th parallel to south, along the coast, they found a \\"land\\" or \\"point extending into the sea\\", and further south, a Gulf.Newen Zeytung auss Presillg Landt (in ancient german and portuguese) Newen Zeytung auss Presillg Landt This and the following expeditions of Crist√≥v√£o Jacques to the River Plate and into the Parana River in 1521; and of Martim Afonso de Sousa and his brother Pero Lopes de Sousa, in 1530-1532, from the Amazon river, to Lagoa dos Patos and to the rivers Plate and Paran√°, reinforced and demonstrated Portuguese interest in the River Plate. Permanent habitation in Brazil did not begin until S√£o Vicente was founded in 1532 by Martim Afonso de Sousa, although temporary trading posts were established earlier to collect brazilwood, used as a dye. S√£o Vicente, by its democratic municipal prerogatives (in the tradition of Portuguese municipalism since the Middle Ages) and by the general elections to its first C√¢mara (City Council) on August 22, 1532, is symbolically considered the birthplace of democracy in the Americas. From 1534 to 1536, 15 Captaincy colonies were created in Portuguese America. The captaincies were autonomous, and mostly private, colonies of the Portuguese Empire, each owned and run by a Captain-major. In 1549, due to their failure and limited success, the Captaincy Colonies of Brazil were united into the Governorate General of Brazil. The captaincy colonies were reorganized as provincial districts to the Governorate. The captaincies continued to be ruled by their hereditary captain-majors but they now reported to the Governor-General of Brazil. The new system was implemented so that Portuguese America could be managed correctly and provide a steady and wealthy income for the Portuguese Empire. The capital of the new governorate established its capital at S√£o Salvador and the first Jesuits arrived the same year. With permanent settlement came the establishment of the sugar cane industry and its intensive labor demands which were met with Native and later African slaves. From 1565 through 1567, Mem de S√°, the third Governor General of Brazil, successfully destroyed a ten-year- old French colony called France Antarctique, at Guanabara Bay. He and his nephew, Est√°cio de S√°, then founded the city of Rio de Janeiro in March 1567. In 1621, Philip II of Portugal divided the Governorate General of Brazil into two separate and autonomous colonies, the State of Maranh√£o and the State of Brazil. Regarding this period it is preferable to refer to \\"Portuguese America\\" rather than \\"Portuguese Brazil\\" or \\"Colonial Brazil\\", as the states were two separate colonies, each with their own governor general and government. Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790. Between 1630 and 1654, the Netherlands came to control part of Brazil's Northeast region, with their capital in Recife. The Portuguese won a significant victory in the Second Battle of Guararapes in 1649. By 1654, the Netherlands had surrendered and returned control of all Brazilian land to the Portuguese. In 1751, the State of Maranh√£o was restructured into the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Maranh√£o, with a new capital and government. In 1772, the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Maranh√£o was split into two new states, the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Rio Negro and the State of Maranh√£o and Piau√≠. The new states would fare poorly and only last 3 years. In 1775, the three colonies of Portuguese America (the State of Brazil, the State of Maranh√£o and Piau√≠; and the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Rio Negro) were united into a singular colony, under the State of Brazil. This arrangement would last until the end of Colonial Brazil. As a result, Brazil did not split into several countries, as happened to its Spanish-speaking neighbors. Caribbean merchants The Early Navigators practically have been to the entire Caribbean, from The Bahamas to Jamaica. Papiamento, one of the languages spoken in the islands, is a mixture of Portuguese , Spanish and African languages. Portuguese merchants have been trading in the West Indies. To such an extent, that, for instance, for the Portuguese town of P√≥voa de Varzim, most of its seafarers dying abroad, most of the deaths occurred in the Route of the Antilles, in the West Indies. At the turn of the 17th century, with the union with Castile, the Spanish kings favored the free movement of the people, and other lands of the New World, such as Peru and the Gulf of Mexico, were open to the Portuguese merchants. Colonization of Uruguay and Venezuela The Portuguese founded the first Uruguayan city, Col√≥nia do Sacramento, and Guanare in Venezuela.

Biography =Early years= William Ronald Reid Jr., called Bill, was born in Victoria, British Columbia; his father was American William Ronald Reid Sr., of Scottish-German descentBill Reid, Can. Museum of Civilization and his mother, Sophie Gladstone Reid, was from the Kaadaas gaah Kiiguwaay, Raven/Wolf Clan of T'anuu, more commonly known as the Haida, one of the First Nations of the Pacific coast. Reid developed a keen interest in Haida art while working as a radio announcer in Toronto for CBC Radio, where he also studied jewelry making at the Ryerson Institute of Technology. His maternal grandfather first taught Reid about Haida art, and through him, Bill inherited his tools from his great-great-uncle Charles Edenshaw, a renowned artist who died the year Reid was born. In 1951, Reid returned to Vancouver, where he eventually established a studio on Granville Island. He became greatly interested in the works of Edenshaw, working to understand the symbolism of his work, much of which had been lost along with many Haida traditions. During this time Reid also worked on salvaging artifacts, including many intricately carved totem poles, which were then moldering in abandoned village sites. He assisted in the partial reconstruction of a Haida village in the University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology. At the age of 29, Reid married a woman named Mabel. They had one child together and later adopted a second. Working in the traditional forms and modern media (usually gold, silver and argillite), Reid began by making jewelry. He gradually explored larger sculptures in bronze, red cedar and Nootka Cypress (yellow cedar), usually portraying figures, animals, and scenes from Haida mythology. He intended to express his ancestors' visual traditions into a contemporary form., Museum of Anthropology =Major works and awards= Reid's most popular works are three large bronze sculptures. Two depict a canoe filled with human and animal figures: one black, The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, is at the Canadian Embassy, Washington, D.C., in the United States; and one green, The Jade Canoe, is at Vancouver International Airport, in British Columbia. The third sculpture, Chief of the Undersea World, depicts a breaching orca and is installed at the Vancouver Aquarium. Plaster casts of these sculptures are held by the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Canada. OBC ribbon Legacy and honours Reid received many honours in his life, including honorary degrees from the University of British Columbia, the University of Toronto, the University of Victoria, the University of Western Ontario, York University, and Trent University. He received the National Aboriginal Achievement Award, the Indspire Awards, for Lifetime Achievement in 1994, and was made a member of the Order of British Columbia and an Officer of France's Order of Arts and Letters.Canada Gazette Part I, Vol. 132, No. 26 He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. On 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued 'The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986-1991, Bill Reid' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on the sculpture The Spirit of Haida Gwaii (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90¬¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.

He stopped work on the sculpture in Washington during this period to protest the destruction of the forests of Haida Gwaii, by the time Bill Reid was alive the archipelago was called the Queen Charlotte Islands. In 1981, he married Martine de Widerspach-Thor (Mormanne), a French anthropologist. Having dedicated the later part of his life to the creation of new works and these tasks of curation, Reid died on 13 March 1998, of Parkinson's disease, in Vancouver. In July 1998 friends and relatives paddled Lootaas, a large cedar canoe carved by Reid for Expo 86, on a two-day journey along the Pacific coast to bring his ashes to Tanu Island in Haida Gwaii, the site of his mother's village of New Clew.

Focus  Wildlife refuge located in Oregon, United States. The links between human and physical geography were once more apparent than they are today. As human experience of the world is increasingly mediated by technology, the relationships between humans and the environment have often become obscured. Thereby, integrated geography represents a critically important set of analytical tools for assessing the impact of human presence on the environment. This is done by measuring the result of human activity on natural landforms and cycles. Methods for which this information is gained include remote sensing, and geographic information systems. Integrated geography helps us to ponder the environment in terms of its relationship to people. With integrated geography we can analyze different social science and humanities perspectives and their use in understanding people environment processes.

That is, after trying every possible key, there should be just one decipherment that makes sense, i.e. expected amount of ciphertext needed to determine the key completely, assuming the underlying message has redundancy. Claude Shannon defined the unicity distance in his 1949 paper \\"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\\". Consider an attack on the ciphertext string \\"WNAIW\\" encrypted using a Vigen√®re cipher with a five letter key. Conceivably, this string could be deciphered into any other string RIVER and WATER are both possibilities for certain keys. This is a general rule of cryptanalysis: with no additional information it is impossible to decode this message. Of course, even in this case, only a certain number of five letter keys will result in English words. Trying all possible keys we will not only get RIVER and WATER, but SXOOS and KHDOP as well. The number of \\"working\\" keys will likely be very much smaller than the set of all possible keys. The problem is knowing which of these \\"working\\" keys is the right one; the rest are spurious. Relation with key size and possible plaintexts In general, given particular assumptions about the size of the key and the number of possible messages, there is an average ciphertext length where there is only one key (on average) that will generate a readable message. In the example above we see only upper case English characters, so if we assume that the plaintext has this form, then there are 26 possible letters for each position in the string. Likewise if we assume five-character upper case keys, there are K=265 possible keys, of which the majority will not \\"work\\". A tremendous number of possible messages, N, can be generated using even this limited set of characters: N = 26L, where L is the length of the message. However, only a smaller set of them is readable plaintext due to the rules of the language, perhaps M of them, where M is likely to be very much smaller than N. Moreover, M has a one-to-one relationship with the number of keys that work, so given K possible keys, only K √ó (M/N) of them will \\"work\\". One of these is the correct key, the rest are spurious. Since M/N gets arbitrarily small as the length L of the message increases, there is eventually some L that is large enough to make the number of spurious keys equal to zero. Roughly speaking, this is the L that makes KM/N=1. This L is the unicity distance. Relation with key entropy and plaintext redundancy The unicity distance can equivalently be defined as the minimum amount of ciphertext required to permit a computationally unlimited adversary to recover the unique encryption key. The expected unicity distance can then be shown to be: : U = H(k) / D where U is the unicity distance, H(k) is the entropy of the key space (e.g. 128 for 2128 equiprobable keys, rather less if the key is a memorized pass-phrase). D is defined as the plaintext redundancy in bits per character. Now an alphabet of 32 characters can carry 5 bits of information per character (as 32 = 25). In general the number of bits of information per character is , where N is the number of characters in the alphabet and is the binary logarithm. So for English each character can convey bits of information. However the average amount of actual information carried per character in meaningful English text is only about 1.5 bits per character. So the plain text redundancy is D = 4.7 ‚àí 1.5 = 3.2. Basically the bigger the unicity distance the better. For a one time pad of unlimited size, given the unbounded entropy of the key space, we have U = \\\\infty, which is consistent with the one-time pad being unbreakable. = Unicity distance of substitution cipher = For a simple substitution cipher, the number of possible keys is , the number of ways in which the alphabet can be permuted. Assuming all keys are equally likely, bits. For English text , thus . So given 28 characters of ciphertext it should be theoretically possible to work out an English plaintext and hence the key. Practical application Unicity distance is a useful theoretical measure, but it doesn't say much about the security of a block cipher when attacked by an adversary with real-world (limited) resources. Consider a block cipher with a unicity distance of three ciphertext blocks. Although there is clearly enough information for a computationally unbounded adversary to find the right key (simple exhaustive search), this may be computationally infeasible in practice. The unicity distance can be increased by reducing the plaintext redundancy. One way to do this is to deploy data compression techniques prior to encryption, for example by removing redundant vowels while retaining readability. This is a good idea anyway, as it reduces the amount of data to be encrypted. Ciphertexts greater than the unicity distance can be assumed to have only one meaningful decryption. Ciphertexts shorter than the unicity distance may have multiple plausible decryptions. Unicity distance is not a measure of how much ciphertext is required for cryptanalysis, but how much ciphertext is required for there to be only one reasonable solution for cryptanalysis.

In 2001, it evolved into the Green Party of the United States.  Founding  In the aftermath of the first Green presidential campaign in 1996, 62 Greens from 30 states gathered over the weekend of November 16‚Äì17, 1996 to found the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP). The meeting was held at the historic Glen-Ora Farm in Middleburg, Virginia where Jack Kennedy had his weekend retreat in his administration's early days (rented to the president by the mother of ASGP meeting host and Nader supporter Elaine Broadhead.) Green Parties from 13 states were the founding members, and approved an initial set of bylaws that set out the ASGP's purpose: (1) Assist in the development of State Green Parties and (2) Create a legally structured national Green Party. The founding meeting also established a national newsletter Green Pages, which carries forward today as the newspaper of the GPUS. The founding editor was Mike Feinstein. Subsequent ASGP meetings occurred in Portland, OR (April 5‚Äì6, 1997), Topsham, ME (October 3‚Äì5, 1997),Santa Fe, NM (April 24‚Äì26, 1998), Moodus, CT (June 5‚Äì6, 1999) and Hiawassee, GA (December 8‚Äì10, 2000). Ralph Nader appeared in Moodus to talk about running for president the next year. The concept of the ASGP came out of the 1991 national Greens Gathering in Elkins, West Virginia, where a committee was tasked with examining what an eventual Green Party might look it. The committee produced a report with contributions from six authors, among them Greg Gerritt from Maine. Gerritt's suggestion was for the creation of an Association of State Green Parties based on sovereign state parties, essentially as he argued, how all parties end up structured in the US. The reaction within the GPUSA was, according to Gerritt, to throw him out of the GPUSA. But that did not kill the concept. Instead it was shared by those involved in the establishment of the Green Politics Network in 1992, and what was founded in 1996 in Middleburg very closely reflected the proposal Gerritt originally submitted.  ASGP and the Greens/Green Party USA  The ASGP was predominantly focused on establishing state Green Parties and running and electing Greens for public office, even while its member state parties and the individual Greens involved remained involved in issue activism. From 1997 to 1999, as more state Green Parties continued to form, a highly competitive environment between the ASGP and the Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA) began to develop in terms of who would affiliate with which organization, and ultimately who would become the definitive national Green Party. To some extent this divide reflected philosophical differences within U.S. Greens that went back to the late 1980s and early 1990s, around how a Green political party should be organized - based upon state parties, or upon dues-paying local Green groups. In December 1999, Santa Monica, CA Green City Councilmember Mike Feinstein and New York Green Howie Hawkins met in New Platz, New York during the state meeting of the Green Party of New York State and crafted the 'Plan for a Single National Green Party, which was more generally known as the Feinstein/Hawkins Proposal, meant to create a single national Green Party from among the ASGP and GPUSA by Earth Day, April 2000. The proposal found quick support within the ASGP, but not within the Greens/GPUSA in time for Earth Day.  Boston Proposal  Instead it would be in October 2000 that the Feinstein/Hawkins proposal was revisited, negotiated further and renamed the 'Boston Proposal' or 'Boston Agreement' (so named because it was negotiated in Boston on October 1‚Äì2 in the days before the first 2000 presidential debate). The negotiators for the Association of State Green Parties were Tony Affigne, David Cobb, Robert Franklin, Greg Gerritt, Anne Goeke, Stephen Herrick, and Tom Sevigny; and for the Greens/Green Party USA: Starlene Rankin, John Stith, Jeff Sutter, Steve Welzer, Rich Whitney, and Julia Willebrand. The Boston Proposal was approved was by the ASGP at its December 2000 meeting in Hiawasee, GA, but did not pass at the July 2001 G/GPUSA Congress in Carbondale, CO. This caused a schism in G/GPUSA membership from which it never recovered. The next week on July 29 in Santa Barbara, CA the ASGP voted to become the Green Party of the United States, held a press conference in Santa Monica on July 30 to announce it, and was subsequently recognized as having National Committee status by the Federal Election Commission. Text of the Boston Proposal: JOINT PROPOSAL OF NEGOTIATING COMMITTEES OF THE ASSOCIATION OF STATE GREEN PARTIES and THE GREENS/GREEN PARTY USA The Negotiating Committees of the Association of State Green Parties and the Greens/Green Party USA, meeting on October 1‚Äì2, 2000, have agreed unanimously to recommend to their respective organizations the following proposal for the creation of a new national Green Party, to be called \\"Green Party of the United States,\\" and a National Committee of the Green Party, which will apply to the Federal Election Commission for official recognition as a national political party. 1\\\\. The Greens/Green Party USA may continue as an independent organization but will cease functioning as a political party and will adopt a new name that will omit the word, \\"party.\\" It will relinquish the domain name, \\"www.greenparty.org\\" to the new party. 2\\\\. The Green Party shall leave the question of state dues entirely to the state parties and shall neither encourage state parties to collect dues nor discourage state parties from collecting dues. 3\\\\. The new Green Party shall have a paid \\"sustaining members\\" category of membership and shall encourage members of all state parties to become sustaining members of the national organization. 4\\\\. State parties in the new Green Party shall have written democratic by-laws and at least one convention a year (whether it be a general membership assembly or a delegate assembly elected by locals and members-at- large). 5\\\\. State Green Parties shall make a good faith effort, where reasonable, to have delegates to the National Committee elected by clusters of local groups. The basis of representation to the National Committee shall be one person, one vote, and in the United States, Congressional Districts are a reasonable approximation of equal population areas. Local groups within a Congressional District or Districts shall come together for the purpose of electing delegates. (Statement of intent: The exact number of delegates and the size of the areas to be used for selecting these delegates is currently under study and will be determined by the ASGP.) 6\\\\. Representation to the National Committee shall be based on the principle of one delegate per specified number of Congressional Districts, provided that there is a requisite level of Green Party activity, electoral and/or non-electoral, being conducted in those Congressional Districts. 7\\\\. The Accreditation Criteria of the Green Party National Committee shall include the following in addition to the criteria currently used by the ASGP: a. Evidence of commitment to, and good faith efforts to achieve, gender balance in party leadership and representation. b. Evidence of good faith efforts to empower individuals and groups from oppressed communities, through, for example, leadership responsibilities, identity caucuses and alliances with community-based organizations, and endorsements of issues and policies. 8\\\\. The Green Party National Committee shall reserve seats for representatives of nationally organized caucuses for traditionally disempowered groups, provided that each caucus shall demonstrate a total membership of at least 100 people, from at least 15 member states, use democratic procedures and choose to send representatives to the National Committee. 9\\\\. The G/GPUSA Negotiating Committee recommends to the affiliates of G/GPUSA that a mail referendum of the Green Congress be initiated. The referendum shall ask the Congress to authorize the G/GPUSA National Committee to certify whether the ASGP, at its December 2000 meeting, amends its bylaws to reflect the terms of this joint proposal. The mail referendum will also authorize the G/GPUSA National Committee to (a) adopt a new name that will omit the word \\"party\\"; (b) relinquish the domain name \\"www.greenparty.org\\" to the new party; and (c) support the request of the ASGP for an advisory opinion on the national committee status of the new party, provided that it does in fact certify that the ASGP has amended its bylaws in accordance with this proposal.  ASGP and Nader 2000 presidential campaign  In September 1998, the New Mexico Green Party proposed that an ASGP Presidential Exploratory Committee be established for the 2000 elections. The ASGP Coordinating Committee passed the proposal on October 30, and on December 20 the ASGP Steering Committee appointed a seven- person committee, chaired by then Texas Green David Cobb. On February 22, 1999 the Committee sent a letter and questionnaire to prospective presidential and vice presidential candidates, asking if they were interested in running on the Green Party ticket in 2000 and if so, how would they envision conducting the campaign: Wendell Berry, Jerry Brown, Lester Brown, Noam Chomsky, Ron Daniels, Ron Dellums, Lani Guinier, Dan Hamburg, Woody Harrelson, Paul Hawken, Jim Hightower, Molly Ivins, Winona LaDuke, Bill McKibben, Cynthia McKinney, Toni Morrison, Ralph Nader, Ron Ouellette (requested the questionnaire), John Robbins and Jan Schlichtmann. On May 10 the committee also sent the letter and questionnaire to: Harry Belafonte, Julian Bond, Joycelyn Elders, Kurt Schmoke, Studs Terkel, Myrlie Evers-Williams and Gen. George Lee Butler. Brown, McKibben, Chomsky, Guinier, Hawken, Miller wrote back declining, but all graciously thanking the ASGP for its outreach, and offering sympathetic statements of support for the Green Party project. Nader also replied: \\"If I seek the nomination - a decision that will not be made until next year- and receive that designation, I will pursue a dedicated and thorough campaign that meets the Federal Election Commission requirements. Such an active campaign will have the objective of strengthening our nation‚Äôs democracy by strengthening the Green Party movement at the local, state and national levels; by emphasizing the problems of, and remedies for, the excessive concentration of corporate power and wealth in our country, by highlighting the important tools of democracy needed for the American people as voters/citizens, workers, consumers, taxpayers, and small savers/investors. If there are Greens who support my seeking the nomination, I encourage them to expand the number of volunteers and increase the time spent working to build the Green Party this year in order to advance the Party‚Äôs ‚ÄúKey Values‚Äù and to increase the likelihood of ballot access in all fifty states.\\" Ralph Nader, 1996 and 2000 nominee At it June 23‚Äì25 convention in Denver, the ASGP nominated Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke for president and vice-president. The pair appeared on 44 state ballots and received 2,883,105 votes, or 2.7 percent of all votes cast. Nader's strong showing in several states solidified the changes in the Green Party, transforming it from an \\"anti-party party\\" to an organization primarily dedicated to electoral campaigns. In particular, that was the widespread understanding of thousands of recruits to the party, as it went through an unprecedented rate of growth.  International  In April 2001, the ASGP was represented at the founding congress of the Global Greens by Mike Feinstein, Annie Goeke and John Rensenbrink. The ASGP was also a founding member party of the Federac√≠on de Partidos Verdes de las Americas in 1998.

Starting with the eponymous PCMCIA card in 1990, it created various standards for peripheral interfaces designed for laptop computers. History The PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) industry organization was based on the original initiative of the British mathematician and computer scientist Ian H. S. Cullimore, one of the founders of the Sunnyvale-based Poqet Computer Corporation, who was seeking to integrate some kind of memory card technology as storage medium into their early DOS-based palmtop PCs, when traditional floppy drives and harddisks were found to be too power-hungry and large to fit into their battery-powered handheld devices. When in July 1989, Poqet contacted Fujitsu for their existing but still non-standardized SRAM memory cards, and Intel for their flash technology, the necessity and potential of establishing a worldwide memory card standard became obvious to the parties involved. This led to the foundation of the PCMCIA organization in September 1989. By early 1990, some thirty companies had joined the initiative already, including Poqet, Fujitsu, Intel, Mitsubishi, IBM, Lotus, Microsoft and SCM Microsystems. From 1990 onwards, the association published and maintained a sequence of standards for parallel communication peripheral interfaces in laptop computers, notably the PCMCIA card, later renamed to PC Card, and succeeded by ExpressCard (2003), all of them now technologically obsolete. The PCMCIA association was dissolved in 2009 and all of its activities have since been managed by the USB Implementer's Forum, according to the PCMCIA website. Name PCMCIA stands for Personal Computer Memory Card International Association, the group of companies that defined the standard. This acronym was difficult to say and remember, and was sometimes jokingly referred to as \\"People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms\\". To recognize increased scope beyond memory, and to aid in marketing, the association acquired the rights to the simpler term \\"PC Card\\" from IBM. This was the name of the standard from version 2 of the specification onwards. These cards were used for wireless networks, modems, and other functions in notebook PCs.

Historically the largest meal used to be eaten around midday, and called dinner. In Western cultures, especially among the elite, it gradually migrated later in the day over the 16th to 19th centuries. However, the word \\"dinner\\" can have different meanings depending on culture, and may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day. In particular, it is still sometimes used for a meal at noon or in the early afternoon on special occasions, such as a Christmas dinner. In hot climates, people have always tended to eat the main meal in the evening, after the temperature has fallen. Etymology Dinner with family The word is from the Old French () disner, meaning \\"dine\\", from the stem of Gallo-Romance desjunare (\\"to break one's fast\\"), from Latin dis- (which indicates the opposite of an action) + Late Latin ieiunare (\\"to fast\\"), from Latin ieiunus (\\"fasting, hungry\\").Etymology of \\"dinner\\" from Online Dictionary. Accessed November 11, 2009.Etymology of \\"dine\\" from Online Dictionary. Accessed November 11, 2009. The Romanian word dejun and the French d√©jeuner retain this etymology and to some extent the meaning (whereas the Spanish word desayuno and Portuguese desjejum are related but are exclusively used for breakfast). Eventually, the term shifted to referring to the heavy main meal of the day, even if it had been preceded by a breakfast meal (or even both breakfast and lunch). Time of day =Historical= Reflecting the typical custom of the 17th century, Louis XIV dined at noon, and had a main dinner at 10 pm.Strong, 250 But in Europe, dinner began to move later in the day during the 1700s, due to developments in work practices, lighting, financial status, and cultural changes. The fashionable hour for dinner continued to be incrementally postponed during the 18th century, to two and three in the afternoon, and in 1765 King George III dined at 4pm, though his infant sons had theirs with their governess at 2pm, leaving time to visit the queen as she dressed for dinner with the king.\\"Text adapted from The Conversation Piece: Scenes of fashionable life, London, 2009\\", at \\"Johan Joseph Zoffany (Frankfurt 1733-London 1810), Queen Charlotte (1744‚Äì1818) with her Two Eldest Sons c.1765\\" on the Royal Collection website. But in France Marie Antoinette, when still Dauphine of France in 1770, wrote that when at the Ch√¢teau de Choisy the court still dined at 2pm, with a supper after the theatre at around 10pm, before bed at 1 or 1.30am.quoted in The Origins of Contemporary France: The ancient r√©gime, by Hippolyte Taine, Bk2, ch.1, p. 110 in this edition At the time of the First French Empire an English traveler to Paris remarked upon the \\"abominable habit of dining as late as seven in the evening\\".Quote in Ian Kelly, Cooking for Kings: the life of Antonin Car√™me the first celebrity chef, 2003:78. For guests of Talleyrand at the Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay, dinner under Car√™me was even later. By about 1850 English middle-class dinners were around 5 or 6pm, allowing men to arrive back from work, but there was a continuing pressure for the hour to drift later, led by the elite who did not have to work set hours, and as commutes got longer as cities expanded. In the mid-19th century the issue was something of a social minefield, with a generational element. John Ruskin, once he married in 1848, dined at 6pm, which his parents thought \\"unhealthy\\". Mrs Gaskell dined between 4 and 5pm. The fictional Mr Pooter, a lower middle-class Londoner in 1888-89 and a diner at 5pm, was invited by his son to dine at 8pm, but \\"I said we did not pretend to be fashionable people, and would like the dinner earlier\\".Flanders, 229-230 The satirical novel Living for Appearances (1855) by Henry Mayhew and his brother Augustus begins with the views of the hero on the matter. He dines at 7pm, and often complains of \\"the disgusting and tradesman-like custom of early dining\\", say at 2pm. The \\"Royal hour\\" he regards as 8pm, but he does not aspire to that. He tells people \\"Tell me when you dine, and I will tell you what you are\\".Living for Appearances (1855), p. 1, by Henry Mayhew and his brother Augustus; Flanders, 230 =Modern= A filet mignon dinner with mashed potato, string beans and mushrooms. In many modern usages, the term dinner refers to the evening meal, which is now typically the largest meal of the day in Western cultures. When this meaning is used, the preceding meals are usually referred to as breakfast, lunch and perhaps a tea. Supper is now often an alternative term for dinner; originally this was always a later secondary evening meal, after an early dinner. The divide between different meanings of \\"dinner\\" is not cut-and-dried based on either geography or socioeconomic class. However, the use of the term dinner for the midday meal is strongest among working-class people, especially in the English Midlands, North of England and the central belt of Scotland. Even in systems in which dinner is the meal usually eaten at the end of the day, an individual dinner may still refer to a main or more sophisticated meal at any time in the day, such as a banquet, feast, or a special meal eaten on a Sunday or holiday, such as Christmas dinner or Thanksgiving dinner. At such a dinner, the people who dine together may be formally dressed and consume food with an array of utensils. These dinners are often divided into three or more courses. Appetizers consisting of options such as soup or salad, precede the main course, which is followed by the dessert. A survey by Jacob's Creek, an Australian winemaker, found the average evening meal time in the U.K. to be 7:47pm. Dinner parties Women in formal dress at dinner at Oxford College, Ohio, United States, date unknown A dinner party is a social gathering at which people congregate to eat dinner. Dinners exist on a spectrum, from a basic meal, to a state dinner. =Ancient Rome= During the times of Ancient Rome, a dinner party was referred to as a convivia, and was a significant event for Roman emperors and senators to congregate and discuss their relations. The Romans often ate and were also very fond of fish sauce called liquamen (also known as Garum) during said parties. =England= In London (‚Äì), dinner parties were formal occasions that included printed invitations and formal RSVPs. The food served at these parties ranged from large, extravagant food displays and several meal courses to more simple fare and food service. Activities sometimes included singing and poetry reciting, among others. =Formal dinners= A formal dinner has several requirements. First, it requires the participants to wear an evening attire such as a tuxedo, with either a black or white tie; second, all food is served from the kitchen; third, \\"neither serving dishes nor utensils are placed on the table. All service and table clearing is performed by butlers and other service staff;\\" fourth multiple courses are served; and finally there is an order of service and seating protocols.

These contrasted with civil efforts including general strikes, boycotts of Israeli Civil Administration institutions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, an economic boycott consisting of refusal to work in Israeli settlements on Israeli products, refusal to pay taxes, and refusal to drive Palestinian cars with Israeli licenses. Israel deployed some 80,000 soldiers in response. Israeli countermeasures, which initially included the use of live rounds frequently in cases of riots, were criticized as disproportionate. Israel argued that violence from Palestinians necessitated a forceful response. However, the IDF's rules of engagement were also criticized as too liberally employing lethal force.

Intra-Palestinian violence was also a prominent feature of the Intifada, with widespread executions of an estimated 822 Palestinians killed as alleged Israeli collaborators (1988‚ÄìApril 1994).Human Rights Watch, Israel, the Occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian Authority Territories, November, 2001. Vol. 13, No. 4(E), p. 49 At the time Israel reportedly obtained information from some 18,000 Palestinians who had been compromised,Amitabh Pal, \\"Islam\\" Means Peace: Understanding the Muslim Principle of Nonviolence Today, ABC-CLIO, 2011 p. 191. although fewer than half had any proven contact with the Israeli authorities.Lockman; Beinin (1989), p. The ensuing Second Intifada took place from September 2000 to 2005. General causes According to Mubarak Awad, a Palestinian American clinical psychologist, the Intifada was a protest against Israeli repression including \\"beatings, shootings, killings, house demolitions, uprooting of trees, deportations, extended imprisonments, and detentions without trial\\".Ackerman; DuVall (2000), p 407. After Israel's capture of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt in the Six-Day War in 1967, frustration grew among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel opened its labor market to Palestinians in the newly occupied territories. Palestinians were recruited mainly to do unskilled or semi-skilled labor jobs Israelis did not want. By the time of the Intifada, over 40 percent of the Palestinian work force worked in Israel daily. Additionally, Israeli expropriation of Palestinian land, high birth rates in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the limited allocation of land for new building and agriculture created conditions marked by growing population density and rising unemployment, even for those with university degrees. At the time of the Intifada, only one in eight college-educated Palestinians could find degree-related work.Ackerman; DuVall (2000), p 401. This was coupled with an expansion of a Palestinian university system catering to people from refugee camps, villages, and small towns generating new Palestinian elite from a lower social strata that was more activistic and confrontational with Israel.Robinson, Glenn E. \\"The Palestinians.\\" The Contemporary Middle East, Third Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 2013. 126‚Äì127. The Israeli Labor Party's Yitzhak Rabin, then Defense Minister, added deportations in August 1985 to Israel's \\"Iron Fist\\" policy of cracking down on Palestinian nationalism.Helena Cobban, 'The PLO and the Intifada', in Robert Owen Freedman, (ed.) The Intifada: Its Impact on Israel, the Arab World, and the Superpowers, University Press of Florida, 1991 pp. 70‚Äì106, pp. 94‚Äì95.'must be considered as an essential part of the backdrop against which the intifada germinated'.(p. 95) This, which led to 50 deportations in the following 4 years,Helena Cobban, 'The PLO and the Intifada', p. 94. In the immediate aftermath of the 6 Day War in 1967, some 15,000 Gazans had been deported to Egypt. A further 1,150 were deported between September 1967 and May 1978. This pattern was drastically curtailed by the Likud governments under Menachem Begin between 1978 and 1984. was accompanied by economic integration and increasing Israeli settlements such that the Jewish settler population in the West Bank alone nearly doubled from 35,000 in 1984 to 64,000 in 1988, reaching 130,000 by the mid nineties. Referring to the developments, Israeli minister of Economics and Finance, Gad Ya'acobi, stated that \\"a creeping process of de facto annexation\\" contributed to a growing militancy in Palestinian society.Lockman; Beinin (1989), p. 32. During the 1980s a number of mainstream Israeli politicians referred to policies of transferring the Palestinian population out of the territories leading to Palestinian fears that Israel planned to evict them. Public statements calling for transfer of the Palestinian population were made by Deputy Defense minister Michael Dekel, Cabinet Minister Mordechai Tzipori and government Minister Yosef Shapira among others. Describing the causes of the Intifada, Benny Morris refers to the \\"all-pervading element of humiliation\\", caused by the protracted occupation which he says was \\"always a brutal and mortifying experience for the occupied\\" and was \\"founded on brute force, repression and fear, collaboration and treachery, beatings and torture chambers, and daily intimidation, humiliation, and manipulation\\" =Background= While the catalyst for the First Intifada is generally dated to a truck incident involving several Palestinian fatalities at the Erez Crossing in December 1987, Mazin Qumsiyeh argues, against Donald Neff, that it began with multiple youth demonstrations earlier in the preceding month.M. B. Qumsiyeh Popular Resistance in Palestine; A History of Hope and Empowerment, Pluto Press; New York 2011.pp. 135 Some sources consider that the perceived IDF failure in late November 1987 to stop a Palestinian guerrilla operation, the Night of the Gliders, in which six Israeli soldiers were killed, helped catalyze local Palestinians to rebel.Shay (2005), p. 74. Mass demonstrations had occurred a year earlier when, after two Gaza students at Birzeit University had been shot by Israeli soldiers on campus on 4 December 1986, the Israelis responded with harsh punitive measures, involving summary arrest, detention and systematic beatings of handcuffed Palestinian youths, ex- prisoners and activists, some 250 of whom were detained in four cells inside a converted army camp, known popularly as Ansar 11, outside Gaza city.Anita Vitullo, 'Uprising in Gaza,' in Lockman and Beinin 1989 pp. 43‚Äì55 pp. 43‚Äì44. A policy of deportation was introduced to intimidate activists in January 1987. Violence simmered as a schoolboy from Khan Yunis was shot dead by Israelis soldiers pursuing him in a Jeep. Over the summer the IDF's Lieutenant Ron Tal, who was responsible for guarding detainees at Ansar 11, was shot dead at point-blank range while stuck in a Gaza traffic jam. A curfew forbidding Gaza residents from leaving their homes was imposed for three days, during the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha. In two incidents on 1 and 6 October 1987, respectively, the IDF ambushed and killed seven Gaza men, reportedly affiliated with Islamic Jihad, who had escaped from prison in May.Vitullo, p. 44 The first incident involved two unarmed men, one a well-known Gaza businessman, at a roadblock. The second occurred in a residential raid, where subsequently a small cache of weapons were found in the cars of four men. The army them bulldozed their homes. A general strike took place, and in response Israel arrested and ordered the deportation of Shaykh 'Abd al-'Aziz Awad, who was held responsible for the growth of popular support for Islamic Jihad, on 15 November. Some days later, a 17-year-old schoolgirl, Intisar al-'Attar, was shot in the back while in her schoolyard in Deir al-Balah by a settler in the Gaza Strip.Vitullo, pp45-6. The settlers did not report the killing. An Israeli schoolteacher was arrested for the incident after a ballistics test was undertaken, but an Israel judge released him after a week, in the wake of Israeli settler protests. Settlers said she had been throwing stones. The Arab summit in Amman in November 1987 focused on the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and the Palestinian issue was shunted to the sidelines for the first time in years.Shalev (1991), p. 33.Nassar; Heacock (1990), p. 31. Leadership and aims The Intifada was not initiated by any single individual or organization. Local leadership came from groups and organizations affiliated with the PLO that operated within the Occupied Territories; Fatah, the Popular Front, the Democratic Front and the Palestine Communist Party.Lockman; Beinin (1989), p. 39. The PLO's rivals in this activity were the Islamic organizations, Hamas and Islamic Jihad as well as local leadership in cities such as Beit Sahour and Bethlehem. However, the intifada was predominantly led by community councils led by Hanan Ashrawi, Faisal Husseini and Haidar Abdel- Shafi, that promoted independent networks for education (underground schools as the regular schools were closed by the military in reprisal), medical care, and food aid.MERIP Palestine, Israel and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, A Primer The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) gained credibility where the Palestinian society complied with the issued communiques. There was a collective commitment to abstain from lethal violence, a notable departure from past practice,\\"What amazed this writer . .was the interesting departure from the norms of the past. Palestinians in the Occupied Territories were continuously insisting that they would not resort to arms. Any escalation in the use of violence on their part would be as a last resort, for defensive purposes only\\", Souad Dajani, cited Pearlman, Violence, Nonviolence, and the Palestinian National Movement, p. 106 which, according to Shalev arose from a calculation that recourse to arms would lead to an Israeli bloodbath and undermine the support they had in Israeli liberal quarters. The PLO and its chairman Yassir Arafat had also decided on an unarmed strategy, in the expectation that negotiations at that time would lead to an agreement with Israel. Pearlman attributes the non-violent character of the uprising to the movement's internal organization and its capillary outreach to neighborhood committees that ensured that lethal revenge would not be the response even in the face of Israeli state repression.√©Pearlman, ibid. p. 107. Hamas and Islamic Jihad cooperated with the leadership at the outset, and throughout the first year of the uprising conducted no armed attacks, except for the stabbing of a soldier in October 1988, and the detonation of two roadside bombs, which had no impact.Pearlman, p. 112. Leaflets publicizing the intifada aims demanded the complete withdrawal of Israel from the territories it had occupied in 1967: the lifting of curfews and checkpoints; it appealed to Palestinians to join in civic resistance, while asking them not to employ arms, since military resistance would only invite devastating retaliation from Israel; it also called for the establishment of the Palestinian state on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, abandoning the standard rhetorical calls, still current at the time, for the \\"liberation\\" of all of Palestine.Walid Salem p. 189 The Intifada An IDF soldier requesting a resident of Jabalia to erase a slogan on a wall during the first intifada. Israel's drive into the occupied territories had occasioned spontaneous acts of resistance, but the administration, pursuing an \\"iron fist\\" policy of deportations, demolition of homes, collective punishment, curfews and the suppression of political institutions, was confident that Palestinian resistance was exhausted. The assessment that the unrest would collapse proved to be mistaken.Mark Tessler, A History of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,Indiana University Press, 1994 p. 677. An improvised tire-puncturing device (slang term 'Ninja') comprising an iron nail inserted into a rubber disc (from used tire). Many of these makeshift weapons were scattered by Palestinians on main roads in the occupied territories of the West Bank during the First Intifada. On 8 December 1987, an Israeli army tank transporter crashed into a row of cars containing Palestinians returning from working in Israel, at the Erez checkpoint. Four Palestinians, three of them residents of the Jabalya refugee camp, the largest of the eight refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, were killed and seven others seriously injured. The traffic incident was witnessed by hundreds of Palestinian labourers returning home from work.Vitullo p. 46. The funerals, attended by 10,000 people from the camp that evening, quickly led to a large demonstration. Rumours swept the camp that the incident was an act of intentional retaliation for the stabbing to death of an Israeli businessman, killed while shopping in Gaza two days earlier.Ruth Margolies Beitler, The Path to Mass Rebellion: An Analysis of Two Intifadas, Lexington Books, 2004 p.xiii.Vitullo, p. 46:'Although Palestinians rushed to aid the man, no one cooperated with military interrogators, who arrested scores of people and clamped a curfew on the area.' Following the throwing of a petrol bomb at a passing patrol car in the Gaza Strip on the following day, Israeli forces, firing with live ammunition and tear gas canisters into angry crowds, shot one young Palestinian dead and wounded 16 others.Ruth Margolies Beitler,The Path to Mass Rebellion: An Analysis of Two Intifadas, p. 116 n.75.Tessler, A History of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, pp. 677-8. On 9 December, several popular and professional Palestinian leaders held a press conference in West Jerusalem with the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights in response to the deterioration of the situation. While they convened, reports came in that demonstrations at the Jabalya camp were underway and that a 17-year-old youth had been shot to death after throwing a petrol bomb at Israeli soldiers. She would later become known as the first martyr of the intifada.Vitullo, p. 46. writes 20 year old man.'Intifada,' in David Seddon,(ed.) A Political and Economic Dictionary of the Middle East, p. 284. Protests rapidly spread into the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Youths took control of neighbourhoods, closed off camps with barricades of garbage, stone and burning tires, meeting soldiers who endeavoured to break through with petrol bombs. Palestinian shopkeepers closed their businesses, and labourers refused to turn up to their work in Israel. Israel defined these activities as 'riots', and justified the repression as necessary to restore 'law and order'.Vitullo p. 47 challenges this:'To the contrary, the protests showed restraint and rationality. . .Demonstrations were not \\"peaceful\\" but neither did they turn Palestinians into mindless mobs. Youths stripped one Israeli down to his underwear in front of Shifa hospital, but then let him run back to his fellow soldiers. A young Palestinian took another soldier's rifle away from him, broke it in two, then handed it back'. Within days the occupied territories were engulfed in a wave of demonstrations and commercial strikes on an unprecedented scale. Specific elements of the occupation were targeted for attack: military vehicles, Israeli buses and Israeli banks. None of the dozen Israeli settlements were attacked and there were no Israeli fatalities from stone-throwing at cars at this early period of the outbreak.Vitullo, p. 47 Equally unprecedented was the extent of mass participation in these disturbances: tens of thousands of civilians, including women and children. The Israeli security forces used the full panoply of crowd control measures to try and quell the disturbances: cudgels, nightsticks, tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets, and live ammunition. But the disturbances only gathered momentum.Shlaim (2000), pp. 450‚Äì1. Soon there was widespread rock-throwing, road-blocking and tire burning throughout the territories. By 12 December, six Palestinians had died and 30 had been injured in the violence. The next day, rioters threw a gasoline bomb at the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem though no one was hurt. The Israeli police and military response also led to a number of injuries and deaths. The IDF killed many Palestinians at the beginning of the Intifada, the majority killed during demonstrations and riots. Since initially a high proportion of those killed were civilians and youths, Yitzhak Rabin adopted a fallback policy of 'might, power and beatings'.Audrey Kurth Cronin, 'How fighting ends: asymmetric wars, terrorism and suicide bombing,' inHolger Afflerbach, Hew Strachan (eds.) How Fighting Ends: A History of Surrender, Oxford University Press, 2012 pp. 417-433, p. 426 Israel used mass arrests of Palestinians, engaged in collective punishments like closing down West Bank universities for most years of the intifada, and West Bank schools for a total of 12 months. Round-the-clock curfews were imposed over 1600 times in just the first year. Communities were cut off from supplies of water, electricity and fuel. At any one time, 25,000 Palestinians would be confined to their homes. Trees were uprooted on Palestinians farms, and agricultural produce blocked from being sold. In the first year over 1,000 Palestinians had their homes either demolished or blocked up. Settlers also engaged in private attacks on Palestinians. Palestinian refusals to pay taxes were met with confiscations of property and licenses, new car taxes, and heavy fines for any family whose members had been identified as stone-throwers.Pearlman, p. 115. =Casualties= In the first year in the Gaza Strip alone, 142 Palestinians were killed, while no Israelis died. 77 were shot dead, and 37 died from tear- gas inhalation. 17 died from beatings at the hand of Israeli police or soldiers.Jean-Pierre Filiu, Gaza: A History, Oxford University Press p. 206.

Between December 1987 and June 1991, 120,000 were injured, 15,000 arrested and 1,882 homes demolished.Sumantra Bose, Contested Lands: Israel- Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia, Cyprus, and Sri Lanka, Harvard University Press, 2007 p. 243 One journalistic calculation reports that in the Gaza Strip alone from 1988 to 1993, some 60,706 Palestinians suffered injuries from shootings, beatings or tear gas.Nami Nasrallah, 'The First and Second Palestinian intifadas,' in David Newman, Joel Peters (eds.) Routledge Handbook on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Routledge, 2013, pp. 56‚Äì67, p. 56. In the first five weeks alone, 35 Palestinians were killed and some 1,200 wounded. Some regarded the Israeli response as encouraging more Palestinians into participating.Ruth Margolies Beitler, The Path to Mass Rebellion: An Analysis of Two Intifadas, p. 120 B'Tselem calculated 179 Israelis killed, while official Israeli statistics place the total at 200 over the same period. 3,100 Israelis, 1,700 of them soldiers, and 1,400 civilians suffered injuries. By 1990 Ktzi'ot Prison in the Negev held approximately one out of every 50 West Bank and Gazan males older than 16 years.Human Rights Watch (HRW) (1991) Prison Conditions in Israel and the Occupied Territories.

Gerald Kaufman remarked: \\"[F]riends of Israel as well as foes have been shocked and saddened by that country's response to the disturbances.\\"McDowall (1989), p. 2. In an article in the London Review of Books, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt asserted that IDF soldiers were given truncheons and encouraged to break the bones of Palestinian protesters. The Swedish branch of Save the Children estimated that \\"23,600 to 29,900 children required medical treatment for their beating injuries in the first two years of the Intifada\\", one third of whom were children under the age of ten years. Israel adopted a policy of arresting key representatives of Palestinian institutions. After lawyers in Gaza went on strike to protest their inability to visit their detained clients, Israel detained the deputy head of its association without trial for six months. Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, the head of the Gaza Medical Association, was likewise arrested and held for a similar period of detention, as were several women active in Women's Work Committees. During Ramadan, many camps in Gaza were placed under curfew for weeks, impeding residents from buying food, and Al- Shati, Jabalya and Burayj were subjected to saturation bombing by tear gas. During the first year of the Intifada, the total number of casualties in the camps from such bombing totalled 16.Vitullo pp. 51-2, =Intra-communal violence= Between 1988 and 1992, intra-Palestinian violence claimed the lives of nearly 1,000. By June 1990, according to Benny Morris, \\"[T]he Intifada seemed to have lost direction. A symptom of the PLO's frustration was the great increase in the killing of suspected collaborators.\\"Morris (1999), p. 612. Roughly 18,000 Palestinians, compromised by Israeli intelligence, are said to have given information to the other side. Collaborators were threatened with death or ostracism unless they desisted, and if their collaboration with the Occupying Power continued, were executed by special troops such as the \\"Black Panthers\\" and \\"Red Eagles\\". An estimated 771 (according to Associated Press) to 942 (according to the IDF) Palestinians were executed on suspicion of collaboration during the span of the Intifada.Sergio Catignani, Israeli Counter-Insurgency and the Intifadas: Dilemmas of a Conventional Army, Routledge, 2008 pp. 81-84. Other notable events On 16 April 1988, a leader of the PLO, Khalil al-Wazir, nom de guerre Abu Jihad or 'Father of the Struggle', was assassinated in Tunis by an Israeli commando squad. Israel claimed he was the 'remote-control \\"main organizer\\" of the revolt', and perhaps believed that his death would break the back of the intifada. During the mass demonstrations and mourning in Gaza that followed, two of the main mosques of Gaza were raided by the IDF and worshippers were beaten and tear-gassed.Anita Vitullo, pp. 50-1 In total between 11 and 15 Palestinians were killed during the demonstrations and riots in Gaza and West Bank that followed al-Wazir's death. In June of that year, the Arab League agreed to support the intifada financially at the 1988 Arab League summit. The Arab League reaffirmed its financial support in the 1989 summit.Sela, Avraham. \\"Arab Summit Conferences.\\" The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East. Ed. Sela.

(1998). Arafat: From Defender to Dictator. New York: Bloomsbury Publishing pp. 201-228 On 8 October 1990, 22 Palestinians were killed by Israeli police during the Temple Mount riots. This led the Palestinians to adopt more lethal tactics, with three Israeli civilians and one IDF soldier stabbed in Jerusalem and Gaza two weeks later. Incidents of stabbing persisted.Ruth Margolies Beitler, The Path to Mass Rebellion: An Analysis of Two Intifadas, p. 128. The Israeli state apparatus carried out contradictory and conflicting policies that were seen to have injured Israel's own interests, such as the closing of educational establishments (putting more youths onto the streets) and issuing the Shin Bet list of collaborators.Nassar; Heacock (1990), p. 115. Suicide bombings by Palestinian militants started on 16 April 1993 with the Mehola Junction bombing, carried at the end of the Intifada. United Nations The large number of Palestinian casualties provoked international condemnation. In subsequent resolutions, including 607 and 608, the Security Council demanded Israel cease deportations of Palestinians. In November 1988, Israel was condemned by a large majority of the UN General Assembly for its actions against the intifada. The resolution was repeated in the following years.Resolution 44/2 of 06.10.89; Resolution 45/69 of 06.12.90; Resolution 46/76 of 11.12.91 =Security Council= On 17 February 1989, the UN Security Council drafted a resolution condemning Israel for disregarding Security Council resolutions, as well as for not complying with the fourth Geneva Convention. The United States, put a veto on a draft resolution which would have strongly deplored it. On 9 June, the US again put a veto on a resolution. On 7 November, the US vetoed a third draft resolution, condemning alleged Israeli violations of human rightsYearbook of the United Nations 1989, Chapter IV, Middle East. 31 December 1989. On 14 October 1990, Israel openly declared that it would not abide Security Council Resolution 672 because it did not pay attention to attacks on Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall. Israel refused to receive a delegation of the Secretary-General, which would investigate Israeli violence. The following Resolution 673 made little impression and Israel kept on obstructing UN investigations.Division for Palestinian Rights (DPR), The question of Palestine 1979‚Äì1990 , Chapter II, section E.

Outcomes The Intifada was recognized as an occasion where the Palestinians acted cohesively and independently of their leadership or assistance of neighbouring Arab states.McDowall (1989), p. Nassar; Heacock (1990), p. 1. The Intifada broke the image of Jerusalem as a united Israeli city. There was unprecedented international coverage, and the Israeli response was criticized in media outlets and international fora.UNGA, Resolution \\"43/21. The uprising (intifadah) of the Palestinian people\\" . 3 November 1988 (doc.nr. A/RES/43/21).Shlaim (2000), p. 455. The success of the Intifada gave Arafat and his followers the confidence they needed to moderate their political programme: At the meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers in mid- November 1988, Arafat won a majority for the historic decision to recognise Israel's legitimacy; to accept all the relevant UN resolutions going back to 29 November 1947; and to adopt the principle of a two-state solution.Shlaim (2000), p. 466. Jordan severed its residual administrative and financial ties to the West Bank in the face of sweeping popular support for the PLO.Pearlman, p. 113 The failure of the \\"Iron Fist\\" policy, Israel's deteriorating international image, Jordan cutting legal and administrative ties to the West Bank, and the U.S.'s recognition of the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people forced Rabin to seek an end to the violence though negotiation and dialogue with the PLO.Shlaim (2000), pp. 455‚Äì7.Foreign Policy Research Institute Yitzhak Rabin: An Appreciation By Harvey Sicherman In the diplomatic sphere, the PLO opposed the Persian Gulf War in Iraq. Afterwards, the PLO was isolated diplomatically, with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia cutting off financial support, and 300,000-400,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from Kuwait before and after the war. The diplomatic process led to the Madrid Conference and the Oslo Accords.Roberts; Garton Ash (2009) p. 37.

A polygraph, popularly referred to as a lie detector test, is a device or procedure that measures and records several physiological indicators such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while a person is asked and answers a series of questions. The belief underpinning the use of the polygraph is that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. There are, however, no specific physiological reactions associated with lying, making it difficult to identify factors that separate liars from truth tellers. Polygraph examiners also prefer to use their own individual scoring method, as opposed to computerized techniques, as they may more easily defend their own evaluations. In some countries, polygraphs are used as an interrogation tool with criminal suspects or candidates for sensitive public or private sector employment. US law enforcement and federal government agencies such as the FBI, NSA and the CIA and many police departments such as the LAPD and the Virginia State Police use polygraph examinations to interrogate suspects and screen new employees. Within the US federal government, a polygraph examination is also referred to as a psychophysiological detection of deception (PDD) examination. The average cost to administer the test in the United States is more than $700 and is part of a $2 billion industry. However, assessments of polygraphy by scientific and government bodies generally suggest that polygraphs are highly inaccurate, may easily be defeated by countermeasures, and are an imperfect or invalid means of assessing truthfulness. A comprehensive 2003 review by the National Academy of Sciences of existing research concluded that there was \\"little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy.\\" The American Psychological Association states \\"Most psychologists agree that there is little evidence that polygraph tests can accurately detect lies.\\" The control question test, also known as the probable lie test, was developed to overcome or mitigate the problems with the relevant-irrelevant testing method. Although the relevant questions in the probable lie test are used to obtain a reaction from liars, the physiological reactions that \\"distinguish\\" liars may also occur in innocent individuals who fear a false detection or feel passionately that they did not commit the crime. Therefore, although a physiological reaction may be occurring, the reasoning behind the response may be different. Further examination of the probable lie test has indicated that it is biased against innocent subjects. Those who are unable to think of a lie related to the relevant question will automatically fail the test. Testing procedure The examiner typically begins polygraph test sessions with a pre- test interview to gain some preliminary information which will later be used to develop diagnostic questions. Then the tester will explain how the polygraph is supposed to work, emphasizing that it can detect lies and that it is important to answer truthfully. Then a \\"stim test\\" is often conducted: the subject is asked to deliberately lie and then the tester reports that he was able to detect this lie. Guilty subjects are likely to become more anxious when they are reminded of the test's validity. However, there are risks of innocent subjects being equally or more anxious than the guilty. Then the actual test starts. Some of the questions asked are \\"irrelevant\\" (\\"Is your name Fred?\\"), others are \\"diagnostic\\" questions, and the remainder are the \\"relevant questions\\" that the tester is really interested in. The different types of questions alternate. The test is passed if the physiological responses to the diagnostic questions are larger than those during the relevant questions. Criticisms have been given regarding the validity of the administration of the Control Question Technique. The CQT may be vulnerable to being conducted in an interrogation-like fashion. This kind of interrogation style would elicit a nervous response from innocent and guilty suspects alike. There are several other ways of administering the questions. An alternative is the Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), or the Concealed Information Test, which is used in Japan. The administration of this test is given to prevent potential errors that may arise from the questioning style. The test is usually conducted by a tester with no knowledge of the crime or circumstances in question. The administrator tests the participant on their knowledge of the crime that would not be known to an innocent person. For example: \\"Was the crime committed with a .45 or a 9 mm?\\" The questions are in multiple choice and the participant is rated on how they react to the correct answer. If they react strongly to the guilty information, then proponents of the test believe that it is likely that they know facts relevant to the case. This administration is considered more valid by supporters of the test because it contains many safeguards to avoid the risk of the administrator influencing the results.For more info on the Guilty Knowledge Test, see The Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT) as an Application of Psychophysiology: Future Prospects and Obstacles Effectiveness Although there is some debate in the scientific community regarding the efficacy of polygraphs, assessments of polygraphy by scientific and government bodies generally suggest that polygraphs are inaccurate, may be defeated by countermeasures, and are an imperfect or invalid means of assessing truthfulness. Despite claims of 90% validity by polygraph advocates, the National Research Council has found no evidence of effectiveness. In particular, studies have indicated that the relevant‚Äìirrelevant questioning technique is not ideal, as many innocent subjects exert a heightened physiological reaction to the crime-relevant questions. The American Psychological Association states \\"Most psychologists agree that there is little evidence that polygraph tests can accurately detect lies.\\" In 2002, a review by the National Research Council found that, in populations \\"untrained in countermeasures, specific-incident polygraph tests can discriminate lying from truth telling at rates well above chance, though well below perfection\\". The review also warns against generalization from these findings to justify the use of polygraphs‚Äî\\"polygraph accuracy for screening purposes is almost certainly lower than what can be achieved by specific-incident polygraph tests in the field\\"‚Äîand notes some examinees may be able to take countermeasures to produce deceptive results. In the 1998 US Supreme Court case United States v. Scheffer, the majority stated that \\"There is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable\\" and \\"Unlike other expert witnesses who testify about factual matters outside the jurors' knowledge, such as the analysis of fingerprints, ballistics, or DNA found at a crime scene, a polygraph expert can supply the jury only with another opinion.\\" The Supreme Court summarized their findings by stating that the use of polygraph was \\"little better than could be obtained by the toss of a coin.\\" In 2005, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals stated that \\"polygraphy did not enjoy general acceptance from the scientific community\\". [PDF] In 2001, William Iacono, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Minnesota, concluded that: > Although the CQT [Control Question Test] may be useful as an investigative > aid and tool to induce confessions, it does not pass muster as a > scientifically credible test.

Polygraphs measure arousal, which can be affected by anxiety, anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), nervousness, fear, confusion, hypoglycemia, psychosis, depression, substance induced states (nicotine, stimulants), substance withdrawal state (alcohol withdrawal) or other emotions; polygraphs do not measure \\"lies\\". A polygraph cannot differentiate anxiety caused by dishonesty and anxiety caused by something else. =US Congress Office of Technology Assessment= In 1983, the US Congress Office of Technology Assessment published a review of the technology and found that =National Academy of Sciences= In 2003, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) issued a report entitled \\"The Polygraph and Lie Detection\\". The NAS found that the majority of polygraph research was \\"unreliable, unscientific and biased\\", concluding that 57 of the approximately 80 research studies that the American Polygraph Association relies on to come to their conclusions were significantly flawed.\\"Conclusions and Recommendations\\". The Polygraph and Lie Detection (2003), National Academies Press. p. 212 These studies did show that specific-incident polygraph testing, in a person untrained in counter-measures, could discern the truth at \\"a level greater than chance, yet short of perfection\\". However, due to several flaws, the levels of accuracy shown in these studies \\"are almost certainly higher than actual polygraph accuracy of specific-incident testing in the field\\". When polygraphs are used as a screening tool (in national security matters and for law enforcement agencies for example) the level of accuracy drops to such a level that \\"Its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies.\\" The NAS concluded that the polygraph \\"may have some utility\\" but that there is \\"little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy\\". (Chapter 8: Conclusions and Recommendations, p. 212) The NAS conclusions paralleled those of the earlier United States Congress Office of Technology Assessment report \\"Scientific Validity of Polygraph Testing: A Research Review and Evaluation\\". Similarly, a report to Congress by the Moynihan Commission on Government SecrecyIV Personnel Security: Protection Through Detection quoting Ralph M. Carney, SSBI Source Yield: An Examination of Sources Contacted During the SSBI (Monterey: Defense Personnel Security Research Center, 1996), 6, affirming that in 81% of cases, the derogatory informations were obtained through questionnaire and/or interrogation. concluded that \\"The few Government-sponsored scientific research reports on polygraph validity (as opposed to its utility), especially those focusing on the screening of applicants for employment, indicate that the polygraph is neither scientifically valid nor especially effective beyond its ability to generate admissions\\". Despite the NAS finding of a \\"high rate of false positives,\\" failures to expose individuals such as Aldrich Ames and Larry Wu-Tai Chin, and other inabilities to show a scientific justification for the use of the polygraph, it continues to be employed. Countermeasures Several proposed countermeasures designed to pass polygraph tests have been described. There are two major types of countermeasures: General State (intending to alter the physiological or psychological state of the examinee for the length of the test), and Specific Point (intending to alter the physiological or psychological state of the examinee at specific periods during the examination, either to increase or decrease responses during critical examination periods). * General State: asked how he passed the polygraph test, Central Intelligence Agency officer turned KGB mole Aldrich Ames explained that he sought advice from his Soviet handler and received the simple instruction to: \\"Get a good night's sleep, and rest, and go into the test rested and relaxed. Be nice to the polygraph examiner, develop a rapport, and be cooperative and try to maintain your calm\\".Weiner, Tim, David Johnston, and Neil A. Lewis, Betrayal: The Story of Aldrich Ames, an American Spy, 1995. Additionally, Ames explained, \\"There's no special magic....Confidence is what does it. Confidence and a friendly relationship with the examiner...rapport, where you smile and you make him think that you like him\\". * Specific Point: other suggestions for countermeasures include for the subject to mentally record the control and relevant questions as the examiner reviews them before the interrogation begins. During the interrogation the subject is supposed to carefully control their breathing while answering the relevant questions, and to try to artificially increase their heart rate during the control questions, for example by thinking of something scary or exciting, or by pricking themselves with a pointed object concealed somewhere on their body. In this way the results will not show a significant reaction to any of the relevant questions.Lykken, David T.

Use Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies in the United States are by far the biggest users of polygraph technology. In the United States alone most federal law enforcement agencies either employ their own polygraph examiners or use the services of examiners employed in other agencies. In 1978 Richard Helms, the eighth Director of Central Intelligence, stated that: Susan McCarthy of Salon said in 2000 that \\"The polygraph is an American phenomenon, with limited use in a few countries, such as Canada, Israel and Japan.\\"McCarthy, Susan. \\"The truth about the polygraph.\\" Salon. March 2, 2000. Retrieved on July 5, 2013. =Canada= In Canada, the 1987 decision of R v B√©land, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the use of polygraph results as evidence in court, finding that they were inadmissible. The polygraph is still used as a tool in the investigation of criminal acts and sometimes employed in the screening of employees for government organizations. In the province of Ontario, the use of polygraphs is not permitted by an employer. A police force does have the authorization to use a polygraph in the course of the investigation of an offence. =United States= Brochure of the Defense Security Service (DSS) about polygraph testing Demonstrating the administration of the polygraph, the polygrapher making notes on the readouts. 1970s \\"The Truth About the Polygraph\\" (National Security Agency (NSA)-produced video on the polygraph process) In 2018, Wired magazine reported that an estimated 2.5 million polygraph tests given each year in the United States, with the majority administered to paramedics, police officers, firefighters, and state troopers. The average cost to administer the test is more than $700 and is part of a $2 billion industry. , polygraph testimony was admitted by stipulation in 19 states, and was subject to the discretion of the trial judge in federal court. The use of polygraph in court testimony remains controversial, although it is used extensively in post-conviction supervision, particularly of sex offenders. In Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993), the old Frye standard was lifted and all forensic evidence, including polygraph, had to meet the new Daubert standard in which \\"underlying reasoning or methodology is scientifically valid and properly can be applied to the facts at issue.\\" While polygraph tests are commonly used in police investigations in the US, no defendant or witness can be forced to undergo the test unless they are under the supervision of the courts. In United States v. Scheffer (1998), the US Supreme Court left it up to individual jurisdictions whether polygraph results could be admitted as evidence in court cases. Nevertheless, it is used extensively by prosecutors, defense attorneys, and law enforcement agencies. In the states of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, Delaware and Iowa it is illegal for any employer to order a polygraph either as conditions to gain employment, or if an employee has been suspected of wrongdoing. The Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (EPPA) generally prevents employers from using lie detector tests, either for pre-employment screening or during the course of employment, with certain exemptions. As of 2013, about 70,000 job applicants are polygraphed by the federal government on an annual basis.Taylor, Marisa and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. \\"Seeing threats, feds target instructors of polygraph-beating methods\\". McClatchy Newspapers. Friday August 16, 2013. Retrieved on Friday August 31, 2013. In the United States, the State of New Mexico admits polygraph testing in front of juries under certain circumstances. In many other states, polygraph examiners are permitted to testify in front of judges in various types of hearings (Motion to Revoke Probation, Motion to Adjudicate Guilt). In 2010 the NSA produced a video explaining its polygraph process. The video, ten minutes long, is titled \\"The Truth About the Polygraph\\" and was posted to the website of the Defense Security Service. Jeff Stein of The Washington Post said that the video portrays \\"various applicants, or actors playing them‚Äîit‚Äôs not clear‚Äîdescribing everything bad they had heard about the test, the implication being that none of it is true.\\"Stein, Jeff. \\"NSA lie detectors no sweat, video says\\". The Washington Post. June 14, 2010. Retrieved on July 5, 2013. AntiPolygraph.org argues that the NSA-produced video omits some information about the polygraph process; it produced a video responding to the NSA video. George Maschke, the founder of the website, accused the NSA polygraph video of being \\"Orwellian\\". The polygraph was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson, a medical student at the University of California, Berkeley and a police officer of the Berkeley Police Department in Berkeley, California. The polygraph was on the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2003 list of greatest inventions, described as inventions that \\"have had profound effects on human life for better or worse.\\" In 2013, the US federal government had begun indicting individuals who stated that they were teaching methods on how to defeat a polygraph test.\\"\\"Owner of 'Polygraph.com' Indicted for Allegedly Training Customers to Lie During Federally Administered Polygraph Examinations\\".

During one of those investigations, upwards of 30 federal agencies were involved in investigations of almost 5000 people who had various degrees of contact with those being prosecuted or who had purchased books or DVDs on the topic of beating polygraph tests. =India= In 2008, an Indian court adopted the Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling test as evidence to convict a woman who was accused of murdering her fianc√©. It was the first time that the result of polygraph was used as evidence in court. On May 5, 2010, The Supreme Court of India declared use of narcoanalysis, brain mapping and polygraph tests on suspects as illegal and against the constitution if consent is not obtained and forced. Article 20(3) of the Indian Constitution states: \\"No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.\\" Polygraph tests are still legal if the defendant requests one. =Israel= The Supreme Court of Israel, in Civil Appeal 551/89 (Menora Insurance v. Jacob Sdovnik), ruled that the polygraph has not been recognized as a reliable device. In other decisions, polygraph results were ruled inadmissible in criminal trials. It has not been clearly decided if polygraph results are inadmissible as evidence in a civil trial. In private discipline, some insurance companies attempt to include a clause in insurance contracts, in which the beneficiary agrees that polygraph results be admissible as evidence. In such cases, where the beneficiary has willingly agreed to such a clause, signed the contract, and taken the test, the courts will honor the contract, and take the polygraph results into consideration. However, it is common practice for lawyers to advise people who signed such contracts to refuse to take the test. Depending on whether or not the beneficiary signed an agreements clause, and whether the test was already taken or not, such a refusal usually has no ill effects; at worst, the court will simply order the person to take the test as agreed. At best, the court will cancel the clause and release the person from taking the test, or rule the evidence inadmissible. =Europe= In most European jurisdictions, practice varies by country but polygraphs are generally not considered reliable evidence and are not generally used by law enforcement. Polygraph testing is widely seen in Europe to violate the right to remain silent. In England and Wales a polygraph test can be taken but the results cannot be used in the courts to prove a case, says Ian Kelcey, a criminal law solicitor. However the Offender Management Act 2007 put in place an option to use polygraph tests to monitor serious sex offenders on parole in England and Wales with those tests becoming compulsary in 2014 for high risk sexual offenders on parole in England and Wales. As of 2017 the justice ministry and Supreme Court of each of the Netherlands and Germany had rejected use of polygraphs.Bundesgerichtshof: Entscheidungen vom 17.12.1998, 1 StR 156/98, 1 StR 258/98 As of 2017 Belgium was the European country with the most prevalent use of polygraph testing by police, with about 300 polygraphs carried out each year in the course of police investigations. The results are not considered viable evidence in bench trials, but have been used in jury trials. The polygraph was used in Lithuania for the first time in 1992. From the 2004 surveys on the use of the Event Knowledge Test (new version of the Concealed Information Test) for criminal investigation.Vitas Sald≈æi≈´nas and Aleksandras Kovalenka (2015). \\"Lie detection with polygraph\\", LAP Lambert Academic Publishing. . =Australia= The High Court of Australia has not yet considered the admissibility of polygraph evidence. However, the New South Wales District Court rejected the use of the device in a criminal trial. In Raymond George Murray 1982 7A Crim R48, Sinclair DCJ refused to admit polygraph evidence tending to support the defense. The judge rejected the evidence because # The veracity of the accused and the weight to be given to his evidence, and other witnesses called in the trial, was a matter for the jury. # The polygraph \\"expert\\" sought to express an opinion as to ultimate facts at issue, which is peculiarly the province of the jury. # The test purported to be expert evidence by the witness who was not qualified as an expert; he was merely an operator and assessor of a polygraph. The scientific premise upon which his assessment was based had not been proved in any court in Australia. # Devoid of any proved or accepted scientific basis, the evidence of the operator is hearsay which is inadmissible. The Court cited, with approval, the Canadian case of Phillion v R 1978 1SCR 18. Lie detector evidence is currently inadmissible in New South Wales courts under the Lie Detectors Act 1983. Under the same act, it is also illegal to use lie detectors for the purpose of granting employment, insurance, financial accommodation, and several other purposes for which lie detectors may be used in other jurisdictions. Security clearances A security clearance in the United States may not be revoked based solely on polygraph results. However, a person's access to sensitive information may be denied if the polygraph results are not favorable. In addition, persons being considered for a government position or job may be denied the employment, if the position specifically requires successful completion of a polygraph examination. It is difficult to precisely determine the effectiveness of polygraph results for the detection or deterrence of spying. It is inadmissible as evidence in most federal courts and military courts martial. The polygraph is more often used as a deterrent to espionage rather than detection. One exception to this was the case of Harold James Nicholson, a CIA employee later convicted of spying for Russia. In 1995, Nicholson had undergone his periodic five-year reinvestigation where he showed a strong probability of deception on questions regarding relationships with a foreign intelligence unit. This polygraph test later launched an investigation which resulted in his eventual arrest and conviction. In most cases, however, polygraphs are more of a tool to \\"scare straight\\" those who would consider espionage. Jonathan Pollard was advised by his Israeli handlers that he was to resign his job from American intelligence if he was ever told he was subject to a polygraph test. Likewise, John Anthony Walker was advised by his handlers not to engage in espionage until he had been promoted to the highest position for which a polygraph test was not required, to refuse promotion to higher positions for which polygraph tests were required, and to retire when promotion was mandated. As part of his plea bargain agreement for his case of espionage for the Soviet Union, Robert Hanssen would be made to undergo a polygraph at any time as a means of damage assessment. In Hanssen's 25-year career with the FBI, not once was he made to undergo a polygraph. In 1983, CIA employee Edward Lee Howard was dismissed when, during a polygraph screening, he truthfully answered a series of questions admitting to minor crimes such as petty theft and drug abuse. In retaliation for his perceived unjust punishment for minor offenses, he later sold his knowledge of CIA operations to the Soviet Union. It is also worth noting that polygraph tests may not deter espionage. From 1945 to the present, at least six Americans have committed espionage while successfully passing polygraph tests. Notable cases of two men who created a false negative result with the polygraphs were Larry Wu-Tai Chin, who spied for China, and Aldrich Ames, who was given two polygraph examinations while with the CIA, the first in 1986 and the second in 1991, while spying for the Soviet Union/Russia. The CIA reported that he passed both examinations after experiencing initial indications of deception.The Adrich H. Ames Case: An Assessment of CIA's Role, Oct. 21, 1994 Memorandum for Heads of Agency Offices from Director of Central Intelligence According to a Senate investigation, an FBI review of the first examination concluded that the indications of deception were never resolved. The Senate committee reported that the second examination, at a time when Ames was under suspicion, resulted in indications of deception and a retest a few days later with a different examiner. The second examiner concluded that there were no further indications of deception. In the CIA's analysis of the second exam, they were critical of their failure to convey to the second examiner the existing suspicions. Ana Belen Montes, a Cuban spy, passed a counterintelligence scope polygraph test administered by DIA in 1994. Despite these errors, in August 2008, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) announced that it would subject each of its 5,700 prospective and current employees to polygraph testing at least once annually.Hess, Pamela, \\"Pentagon's Intelligence Arm Steps Up Lie-Detector Efforts\\", Arizona Daily Star, August 24, 2008. Also in Fox News via AP This expansion of polygraph screening at DIA occurred while DIA polygraph managers ignored documented technical problems discovered in the Lafayette computerized polygraph system. The DIA uses computerized Lafayette polygraph systems for routine counterintelligence testing. The impact of the technical flaws within the Lafayette system on the analysis of recorded physiology and on the final polygraph test evaluation is currently unknown. In 2012, a McClatchy investigation found that the National Reconnaissance Office was possibly breaching ethical and legal boundaries by encouraging its polygraph examiners to extract personal and private information from US Department of Defense personnel during polygraph tests that purported to be limited in scope to counterintelligence matters. Allegations of abusive polygraph practices were brought forward by former NRO polygraph examiners.Taylor, Marisa, \\"Sen. Charles Grassley Seeks Probe Of Polygraph Techniques At National Reconnaissance Office\\", The McClatchy Company, 27 July 2012 Alternative tests Most polygraph researchers have focused more on the exam's predictive value on a subject's guilt. However, there have been no empirical theories established to explain how a polygraph measures deception. Recent research indicates that Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) may benefit in explaining the psychological correlations of polygraph exams. It could also explain which parts of the brain are active when subjects use artificial memories. Most brain activity occurs in both sides of the prefrontal cortex, which is linked to response inhibition. This indicates that deception may involve inhibition of truthful responses. Recalling artificial memories are known to activate the posterior cingulate cortex. However, fMRIs are limited by being expensive, immobile, and having inconsistent lying responses. Some researchers believe that reaction time (RT) based tests may replace polygraphs in concealed information detection. RT based tests differ from polygraphs in stimulus presentation duration, and can be conducted without physiological recording as subject response time is measured via computer. However, researchers have found limitations to these tests as subjects voluntarily control their reaction time, deception can still occur within the response deadline, and the test itself lacks physiological recording. History Earlier societies utilized elaborate methods of lie detection which mainly involved torture; for instance, the Middle Ages used boiling water to detect liars as it was believed honest men would withstand it better than liars. Early devices for lie detection include an 1895 invention of Cesare Lombroso used to measure changes in blood pressure for police cases, a 1904 device by Vittorio Benussi used to measure breathing, and an abandoned project by American William Moulton Marston which used blood pressure to examine German prisoners of war (POWs). Marston‚Äôs machine indicated a strong positive correlation between systolic blood pressure and lying. Marston wrote a second paper on the concept in 1915, when finishing his undergraduate studies. He entered Harvard Law School and graduated in 1918, re-publishing his earlier work in 1917. Marston's main inspiration for the device was his wife, Elizabeth Holloway Marston. \\"According to Marston‚Äôs son, it was his mother Elizabeth, Marston‚Äôs wife, who suggested to him that 'When she got mad or excited, her blood pressure seemed to climb (Lamb, 2001). Although Elizabeth is not listed as Marston‚Äôs collaborator in his early work, Lamb, Matte (1996), and others refer directly and indirectly to Elizabeth's work on her husband's deception research. She also appears in a picture taken in his polygraph laboratory in the 1920s (reproduced in Marston, 1938). Despite his predecessors' contributions, Marston styled himself the \\"father of the polygraph\\". (Today he is often equally or more noted as the creator of the comic book character Wonder Woman.)Lepore, Jill. The Secret History of Wonder Woman, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2014, , pp. 183‚Äì209. Marston remained the device's primary advocate, lobbying for its use in the courts. In 1938 he published a book, The Lie Detector Test, wherein he documented the theory and use of the device.Marston, William Moulton. The Lie Detector Test. New York: Richard R. Smith, 1938. In 1938 he appeared in advertising by the Gillette company claiming that the polygraph showed Gillette razors were better than the competition.Lie Detector Charts Emotional Effects of Shaving ‚Äì 1938 Gillette AdvertisementFBI File of William Moulton Marston(including report on Gillette advertising campaign) A device recording both blood pressure and breathing was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson of the University of California and first applied in law enforcement work by the Berkeley Police Department under its nationally renowned police chief August Vollmer.Katherine To for Illumin. Fall 2003. Lie Detection: The Science and Development of the Polygraph Further work on this device was done by Leonarde Keeler. As Larson's protege, Keeler updated the device by making it portable and added the galvanic skin response to it in 1939. His device was then purchased by the FBI, and served as the prototype of the modern polygraph. Several devices similar to Keeler's polygraph version included the Berkeley Psychograph, a blood pressure-pulse-respiration recorder developed by C. D. Lee in 1936Inbau, Fred E. Lie Detection and Criminal Interrogation, The Williams & Wilkins Company, 1948 and the Darrow Behavior Research Photopolygraph, which was developed and intended solely for behavior research experiments. A device which recorded muscular activity accompanying changes in blood pressure was developed in 1945 by John E. Reid, who claimed that greater accuracy could be obtained by making these recordings simultaneously with standard blood pressure-pulse-respiration recordings. Society and culture =Portrayal on television= Lie detection has a long history in mythology and fairy tales; the polygraph has allowed modern fiction to use a device more easily seen as scientific and plausible. Notable instances of polygraph usage include uses in crime and espionage themed television shows and some daytime television talk shows, cartoons and films. Numerous TV shows have been called Lie Detector or featured the device. The first Lie Detector TV show aired in the 1950s, created and hosted by Ralph Andrews. In the 1960s Andrews produced a series of specials hosted by Melvin Belli. In the 1970s the show was hosted by Jack Anderson. In early 1983 Columbia Pictures Television put on a syndicated series hosted by F. Lee Bailey.IMPAC: F. Lee Bailey bio In 1998 TV producer Mark Phillips with his Mark Phillips Philms & Telephision put Lie Detector back on the air on the FOX Network‚Äîon that program Ed Gelb with host Marcia Clark questioned Mark Fuhrman about the allegation that he \\"planted the bloody glove\\". In 2005 Phillips produced Lie Detector as a series for PAX/ION; some of the guests included Paula Jones, Reverend Paul Crouch accuser Lonny Ford, Ben Rowling, Jeff Gannon and Swift Boat Vet, Steve Garner.Google Books:\\"Lie detectors\\" By Kerry Segrave In the Fox game show The Moment of Truth, contestants are privately asked personal questions a few days before the show while hooked to a polygraph. On the show they asked the same questions in front of a studio audience and members of their family. In order to advance in the game they must give a \\"truthful\\" answer as determined by the previous polygraph exam. Daytime talk shows, such as Maury Povich, Jeremy Kyle and Steve Wilkos, frequently use polygraphs to detect deception in social matters such as cheating, child abuse and theft. In episode 93 of the US popular science show MythBusters, the hosts attempted to fool the polygraph by using pain to try to increase the readings when answering truthfully (so the machine will supposedly interpret the truthful and non-truthful answers as the same). They also attempted to fool the polygraph by thinking happy thoughts when lying and thinking stressful thoughts when telling the truth to try to confuse the machine. However, neither technique was successful for a number of reasons. Michael Martin correctly identified each guilty and innocent subject. The show also noted the opinion that, when done properly, polygraphs are correct 80‚Äì99% of the time,For critical commentary on this episode, see however no evidence of this opinion was presented during the episode. =Hand- held lie detector for US military= A hand-held lie detector is being deployed by the US Department of Defense according to a report in 2008 by investigative reporter Bill Dedman of NBC News. The Preliminary Credibility Assessment Screening System, or PCASS, captures less physiological information than a polygraph, and uses an algorithm, not the judgment of a polygraph examiner, to render a decision whether it believes the person is being deceptive or not. The device was first used in Afghanistan by US Army troops. The Department of Defense ordered its use be limited to non-US persons, in overseas locations only. =Notable cases= Polygraphy has been faulted for failing to trap known spies such as double-agent Aldrich Ames, who passed two polygraph tests while spying for the Soviet Union.Ames provides personal insight into the U.S. Government's reliance on polygraphy in a 2000 letter to Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. However Ames did fail several tests while at the CIA that were never acted on.Ronald Kessler. \\"Spies, Lies, Averted Eyes\\". The New York Times, March 8, 1994. Accessed March 19, 2018. Other spies who passed the polygraph include Karl Koecher,Kessler, Ron. \\"Moscow's Mole in the CIA: How a Swinging Czech Superspy Stole America's Most Sensitive Secrets\\", Washington Post, April 17, 1988, C1. Ana Belen Montes, \\"She first came under U.S. suspicion in 1994, when Cuba detected a highly secret electronic surveillance system. Montes took a polygraph test and passed it.\\" and Leandro Aragoncillo. \\"Officials say Aragoncillo passed several lie detector tests that are routinely given to individuals with top secret clearances.\\" However, CIA spy Harold James Nicholson failed his polygraph examinations, which aroused suspicions that led to his eventual arrest. Polygraph examination and background checks failed to detect Nada Nadim Prouty, who was not a spy but was convicted for improperly obtaining US citizenship and using it to obtain a restricted position at the FBI. The polygraph also failed to catch Gary Ridgway, the \\"Green River Killer\\". Another suspect allegedly failed a given lie detector test, whereas Ridgway passed. Ridgway passed a polygraph in 1984; he confessed almost 20 years later when confronted with DNA evidence. In the interim he had killed seven additional women. Conversely, innocent people have been known to fail polygraph tests. In Wichita, Kansas in 1986, because he failed two polygraph tests (one police administered, the other given by an expert that he had hired), Bill Wegerle had to live under a cloud of suspicion of murdering his wife Vicki Wegerle, although he was neither arrested nor convicted of her death. In March 2004, evidence surfaced connecting her death to the serial killer known as BTK, and in 2005 DNA evidence from the Wegerle murder confirmed that the BTK Killer was Dennis Rader\\"BTK: Out Of The Shadows\\". 48 Hours Mysteries. CBS News, October 1, 2005 and established Bill Wegerle's innocence. Prolonged polygraph examinations are sometimes used as a tool by which confessions are extracted from a defendant, as in the case of Richard Miller, who was persuaded to confess largely by polygraph results combined with appeals from a religious leader. In the high-profile disappearance of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam of San Diego in 2002, police suspected neighbor David Westerfield; he became the prime suspect when he allegedly failed a polygraph test.Roth, Alex. \\"Westerfield failed polygraph test badly: 'Greater than 99%' chance he was lying, examiner says on tape\\", San Diego Union-Tribune, January 9, 2003.

Steinhaus obtained his PhD under David Hilbert at G√∂ttingen University in 1911 and later became a professor at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lw√≥w (now Lviv, Ukraine), where he helped establish what later became known as the Lw√≥w School of Mathematics. He is credited with \\"discovering\\" mathematician Stefan Banach, with whom he gave a notable contribution to functional analysis through the Banach‚ÄìSteinhaus theorem. After World War II Steinhaus played an important part in the establishment of the mathematics department at Wroc≈Çaw University and in the revival of Polish mathematics from the destruction of the war. Author of around 170 scientific articles and books, Steinhaus has left his legacy and contribution in many branches of mathematics, such as functional analysis, geometry, mathematical logic, and trigonometry. Notably he is regarded as one of the early founders of game theory and probability theory which led to later development of more comprehensive approaches by other scholars. Early life and studies Steinhaus was born on January 14, 1887 in Jas≈Ço, Austria-Hungary to a family with Jewish roots. His father, Bogus≈Çaw, was a local industrialist, owner of a brick factory and a merchant. His mother was Ewelina, n√©e Lipschitz. Hugo's uncle, Ignacy Steinhaus, was a lawyer and an activist in the Ko≈Ço Polskie (Polish Circle), and a deputy to the Galician Diet, the regional assembly of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Hugo finished his studies at the gymnasium in Jas≈Ço in 1905. His family wanted him to become an engineer but he was drawn to abstract mathematics and began to study the works of famous contemporary mathematicians on his own. In the same year he began studying philosophy and mathematics at the University of Lemberg. In 1906 he transferred to G√∂ttingen University. At that University he received his Ph.D. in 1911, having written his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of David Hilbert. The title of his thesis was Neue Anwendungen des Dirichlet'schen Prinzips (\\"New applications to Dirichlet's principle\\"). At the start of World War I Steinhaus returned to Poland and served in J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's Polish Legion, after which he lived in Krak√≥w. He was an atheist. Academic career =Interwar Poland= During the 1916-1917 period and before Poland had regained its full independence, which occurred in 1918, Steinhaus worked in Krak√≥w for the Ministry of the Interior in the ephemeral puppet state of Kingdom of Poland. In 1917 he started to work at the University of Lemberg (later Jan Kazimierz University in Poland) and acquired his habilitation qualification in 1920. In 1921 he became a profesor nadzwyczajny (associate professor) and in 1925 profesor zwyczajny (full professor) at the same university. During this time he taught a course on the then cutting edge theory of Lebesgue integration, one of the first such courses offered outside France. While in Lw√≥w, Steinhaus co-founded the Lw√≥w School of Mathematics and was active in the circle of mathematicians associated with the Scottish cafe, although, according to Stanislaw Ulam, for the circle's gatherings, Steinhaus would have generally preferred a more upscale tea shop down the street. =World War II= The Scottish Book from the Lw√≥w School of Mathematics, which Steinhaus contributed to and probably saved during World War II. In September 1939 after Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union both invaded and occupied Poland, as a fulfillment of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact they had signed earlier, Lw√≥w initially came under Soviet occupation. Steinhaus considered escaping to Hungary but ultimately decided to remain in Lw√≥w. The Soviets reorganized the university to give it a more Ukrainian character, but they did appoint Stefan Banach (Steinhaus's student) as the dean of the mathematics department and Steinhaus resumed teaching there. The faculty of the department at the school were also strengthened by several Polish refugees from German-occupied Poland. According to Steinhaus, during the experience of this period, he \\"acquired an insurmountable physical disgust in regard to all sorts of Soviet administrators, politicians and commissars\\" During the interwar period and the time of the Soviet occupation, Steinhaus contributed ten problems to the famous Scottish Book, including the last one, recorded shortly before Lw√≥w was captured by the Nazis in 1941, during Operation Barbarossa. Steinhaus, because of his Jewish background, spent the Nazi occupation in hiding, first among friends in Lw√≥w, then in the small towns of Osiczyna, near Zamo≈õƒá and Berdech√≥w, near Krak√≥w. The Polish anti-Nazi resistance provided him with false documents of a forest ranger who had died sometime earlier, by the name of Grzegorz Krochmalny. Under this name he taught clandestine classes (higher education was forbidden for Poles under the German occupation). Worried about the possibility of imminent death if captured by Germans, Steinhaus, without access to any scholarly material, reconstructed from memory and recorded all the mathematics he knew, in addition to writing other voluminous memoirs, of which only a little part has been published. Also while in hiding, and cut off from reliable news on the course of the war, Steinhaus devised a statistical means of estimating for himself the German casualties at the front based on sporadic obituaries published in the local press. The method relied on the relative frequency with which the obituaries stated that the soldier who died was someone's son, someone's \\"second son\\", someone's \\"third son\\" and so on. According to his student and biographer, Mark Kac, Steinhaus told him that the happiest day of his life were the twenty four hours between the time that the Germans left occupied Poland and the Soviets had not yet arrived (\\"They had left, and they had not yet come\\"). =After World War II= Commemorative plaque, Wroc≈Çaw, Poland In the last days of World War II Steinhaus, still in hiding, heard a rumor that University of Lw√≥w was to be transferred to the city of Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw), which Poland was to acquire as a result of the Potsdam agreement (Lw√≥w became part of Soviet Ukraine). Although initially he had doubts, he turned down offers for faculty positions in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Lublin and made his way to the city where he began teaching at University of Wroc≈Çaw. While there, he revived the idea behind the Scottish Book from Lw√≥w, where prominent and aspiring mathematicians would write down problems of interest along with prizes to be awarded for their solution, by starting the New Scottish Book. It was also most likely Steinhaus who preserved the original Scottish Book from Lw√≥w throughout the war and subsequently sent it to Stanis≈Çaw Ulam, who translated it into English. With Steinhaus' help, Wroc≈Çaw University became renowned for mathematics, much as the University of Lw√≥w had been. Later, in the 1960s, Steinhaus served as a visiting professor at the University of Notre Dame (1961‚Äì62) and the University of Sussex (1966). Mathematical contributions Steinhaus authored over 170 works. Unlike his student, Stefan Banach, who tended to specialize narrowly in the field of functional analysis, Steinhaus made contributions to a wide range of mathematical sub-disciplines, including geometry, probability theory, functional analysis, theory of trigonometric and Fourier series as well as mathematical logic. He also wrote in the area of applied mathematics and enthusiastically collaborated with engineers, geologists, economists, physicians, biologists and, in Kac's words, \\"even lawyers\\". Probably his most notable contribution to functional analysis was the 1927 proof of the Banach‚ÄìSteinhaus theorem, given along with Stefan Banach, which is now one of the fundamental tools in this branch of mathematics. His interest in games led him to propose an early formal definition of a strategy, anticipating John von Neumann's more complete treatment of a few years later. Consequently, he is considered an early founder of modern game theory. As a result of his work on infinite games Steinhaus, together with another of his students, Jan Mycielski, proposed the axiom of determinacy. Steinhaus was also an early contributor to, and co-founder of, probability theory, which at the time was in its infancy and not even considered an actual part of mathematics. He provided the first axiomatic measure-theoretic description of coin-tossing, which was to influence the full axiomatization of probability by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov a decade later. Steinhaus was also the first to offer precise definitions of what it means for two events to be \\"independent\\", as well as for what it means for a random variable to be \\"uniformly distributed\\". While in hiding during World War II, Steinhaus worked on the fair cake-cutting problem: how to divide a heterogeneous resource among several people with different preferences such that every person believes he received a proportional share. Steinhaus' work has initiated the modern research of the fair cake-cutting problem. Steinhaus was also the first person to conjecture the ham-sandwich theorem, and one of the first to propose the method of k-means clustering. Legacy Honorary doctorate bestowed on Steinhaus by Pozna≈Ñ University Steinhaus is said to have \\"discovered\\" the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach in 1916, after he overheard someone utter the words \\"Lebesgue integral\\" while in a Krak√≥w park (Steinhaus referred to Banach as his \\"greatest mathematical discovery\\"). Together with Banach and the other participant of the park discussion, Otto Nikodym, Steinhaus started the Mathematical Society of Krak√≥w, which later evolved into the Polish Mathematical Society. He was a member of PAU (the Polish Academy of Learning) and PAN (the Polish Academy of Sciences), PTM (the Polish Mathematical Society), the Wroc≈Çawskie Towarzystwo Naukowe (Wroc≈Çaw Scientific Society) as well as many international scientific societies and science academies. Steinhaus also published one of the first articles in Fundamenta Mathematicae, in 1921. He also co-founded Studia Mathematica along with Stefan Banach (1929), and Zastosowania matematyki (Applications of Mathematics, 1953), Colloquium Mathematicum, and Monografie Matematyczne (Mathematical Monographs). He received honorary doctorate degrees from Warsaw University (1958), Wroc≈Çaw Medical Academy (1961), Pozna≈Ñ University (1963) and Wroc≈Çaw University (1965). Steinhaus had full command of several foreign languages and was known for his aphorisms, to the point that a booklet of his most famous ones in Polish, French and Latin has been published posthumously. In 2002, the Polish Academy of Sciences and Wroc≈Çaw University sponsored \\"2002, The Year of Hugo Steinhaus\\", to celebrate his contributions to Polish and world science. Notable mathematician Mark Kac, Steinhaus's student, wrote: Chief works * Czym jest, a czym nie jest matematyka (What Mathematics Is, and What It Is Not, 1923). * Sur le principe de la condensation de la singularit√©s (with Banach, 1927) * Theorie der Orthogonalreihen (with Stefan Kaczmarz, 1935). * Kalejdoskop matematyczny (Mathematical Snapshots, 1939). * Taksonomia wroc≈Çawska (A Wroclaw Taxonomy; with others, 1951). * Sur la liaison et la division des points d'un ensemble fini (On uniting and separating the points of a finite set, with others, 1951). * Sto zada≈Ñ (One Hundred Problems In Elementary Mathematics, 1964). * Orze≈Ç czy reszka (Heads or Tails, 1961). * S≈Çownik racjonalny (A Rational Dictionary, 1980).  Family  His daughter Lidya Steinhaus was married to Jan Kott.  Grave  Steinhaus is buried in Cmentarz ≈öwiƒôtej Rodziny in Sƒôpolno, Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. On November 1, 2017, a controversy arose as the University of Wroc≈Çaw took no action to pay for his grave to keep it until 2022 in face of its expiration because it supposedly \\"had no money\\". Mayor Rafa≈Ç Dutkiewicz was also widely criticized for doing nothing. Random people organized a charity and paid for the grave to remain.

The subjects were made to view pornography; the device then measured the diameter of the pupils of the eyes (pupillary response test), perspiration, and pulse for a supposed erotic response. The \\"fruit machine\\" was employed in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s during a campaign to eliminate all gay men from the civil service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the military. A substantial number of workers did lose their jobs. Although funding for the \\"fruit machine\\" project was cut off in the late 1960s, the investigations continued, and the RCMP collected files on over 9,000 \\"suspected\\" gay people. The chair employed resembled that used by dentists. It had a pulley with a camera going towards the pupils, with a black box located in front of it that displayed pictures. The pictures ranged from the mundane to sexually explicit photos of men and women. It had previously been determined that the pupils would dilate in relation to the amount of interest in the picture per the technique termed 'the pupillary response test'.The RCMP Security Service. (Doubleday Canada, 1980) , chapters 10 and 11. People were first led to believe that the machine's purpose was to rate stress. After knowledge of its real purpose became widespread, few people volunteered for it. Faulty test parameters The accuracy and functional mechanism of the \\"fruit machine\\" was questionable. First, the pupillary response test was based on fatally flawed assumptions: that visual stimuli would give an involuntary reaction that can be measured scientifically; that homosexuals and heterosexuals would respond to these stimuli differently; and that there were only two types of sexuality.The Current, CBC Radio, 9 May 2005 A physiological problem with the method was that the researchers failed to take into account the varying sizes of the pupils and the differing distances between the eyes. Other problems that existed were that the pictures of the subjects' eyes had to be taken from an angle, as the camera would have blocked the subjects' view of the photographs if it were placed directly in front. Also, the amount of light coming from the photographs changed with each slide, causing the subjects' pupils to dilate in a way that was unrelated to their interest in the picture. Finally, the dilation of the pupils was also exceedingly difficult to measure, as the change was often smaller than one millimeter. The idea was based on a study done by an American university professor, which measured the sizes of the subjects' pupils as they walked through the aisles of grocery stores. In popular culture Brian Drader's 1998 play The Fruit Machine juxtaposes the fruit machine project with a parallel storyline about contemporary homophobia. An abandoned attempt to employ a fruit machine during the interrogation of Canadian diplomat John Watkins was shown in the 2002 TV film, Agent of Influence. Alex Brett's novel Cold Dark Matter (2005) uses the project as a plot device. Sarah Fodey's 2018 documentary film The Fruit Machine profiled the effects of the project on several of the people affected by it.\\"The Fruit Machine: Why every Canadian should learn about this country's 'gay purge'\\".

They formed the 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. The name also applies to the navigators, bombardiers, mechanics, instructors, crew chiefs, nurses, cooks and other support personnel. All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Griel Field, Kennedy Field, Moton Field, Shorter Field and the Tuskegee Army Air Fields. They were educated at Tuskegee Institute (latterly Tuskegee University), located near Tuskegee, Alabama. Of the 922 pilots, five were Haitians from the Haitian Air Force and one pilot was from Trinidad.\\"Tuskegee Airmen Pilot Listing\\" , tuskegee.edu; retrieved 13 May 2014. It also included a Hispanic or Latino airman born in the Dominican Republic. The 99th Pursuit Squadron (later the 99th Fighter Squadron) was the first black flying squadron, and the first to deploy overseas (to North Africa in April 1943, and later to Sicily and Italy). The 332nd Fighter Group, which originally included the 100th, 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons, was the first black flying group. It deployed to Italy in early 1944. Although the 477th Bombardment Group trained with North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, they never served in combat. In June 1944, the 332nd Fighter Group began flying heavy bomber escort missions and, in July 1944, with the addition of the 99th Fighter Squadron, it had four fighter squadrons. The 99th Fighter Squadron was initially equipped with Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter-bomber aircraft. The 332nd Fighter Group and its 100th, 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons were equipped for initial combat missions with Bell P-39 Airacobras (March 1944), later with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts (June‚ÄìJuly 1944) and finally with the aircraft with which they became most commonly associated, the North American P-51 Mustang (July 1944). When the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P-47s red, the nickname \\"Red Tails\\" was coined. The red markings that distinguished the Tuskegee Airmen included red bands on the noses of P-51s as well as a red rudder; the P-51B and D Mustangs flew with similar color schemes, with red propeller spinners, yellow wing bands and all-red tail surfaces. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African- American military aviators in the United States Armed Forces. During World War II, black Americans in many U.S. states were still subject to the Jim Crow laws and the American military was racially segregated, as was much of the federal government. The Tuskegee Airmen were subjected to discrimination, both within and outside the army. History =Origins= Background P-51C Mustang flown by Commemorative Air Force in the colors and markings of Lieutenant Colonel Lee Archer Red Tail Project Stearman Kaydet training aircraft used by the Tuskegee Airmen, bearing the name Spirit of Tuskegee Portrait of Tuskegee airman Edward M. Thomas by photographer Toni Frissell, March 1945 Before the Tuskegee Airmen, no African-American had been a U.S. military pilot. In 1917, African-American men had tried to become aerial observers but were rejected.Francis and Caso 1997, pp. 38‚Äì39. African-American Eugene Bullard served in the French air service during World War I because he was not allowed to serve in an American unit. Instead, Bullard returned to infantry duty with the French.Lloyd 2000, p. 176. The racially motivated rejections of World War I African-American recruits sparked more than two decades of advocacy by African-Americans who wished to enlist and train as military aviators. The effort was led by such prominent civil rights leaders as Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, labor union leader A. Philip Randolph and Judge William H. Hastie. Finally, on 3 April 1939, Appropriations Bill Public Law 18 was passed by Congress containing an amendment by Senator Harry H. Schwartz designating funds for training African-American pilots. The War Department managed to put the money into funds of civilian flight schools willing to train black Americans. War Department tradition and policy mandated the segregation of African-Americans into separate military units staffed by white officers, as had been done previously with the 9th Cavalry, 10th Cavalry, 24th Infantry Regiment and 25th Infantry Regiment. When the appropriation of funds for aviation training created opportunities for pilot cadets, their numbers diminished the rosters of these older units.Moye 2010, p. 19. In 1941, the War Department and the Army Air Corps, under pressure ‚Äî three months before its transformation into the USAAF ‚Äî constituted the first all-black flying unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron. Because of the restrictive nature of selection policies, the situation did not seem promising for African-Americans, since in 1940 the U.S. Census Bureau reported there were only 124 African-American pilots in the nation.Moye 2010, p. 25. The exclusionary policies failed dramatically when the Air Corps received an abundance of applications from men who qualified, even under the restrictive requirements. Many of the applicants already had participated in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, unveiled in late December 1938 (CPTP). Tuskegee University had participated since 1939.Benton 1999, p. 43. Testing The U.S. Army Air Corps had established the Psychological Research Unit 1 at Maxwell Army Air Field, Montgomery, Alabama, and other units around the country for aviation cadet training, which included the identification, selection, education, and training of pilots, navigators and bombardiers. Psychologists employed in these research studies and training programs used some of the first standardized tests to quantify IQ, dexterity and leadership qualities to select and train the best-suited personnel for the roles of bombardier, navigator, and pilot. The Air Corps determined that the existing programs would be used for all units, including all-black units. At Tuskegee, this effort continued with the selection and training of the Tuskegee Airmen. The War Department set up a system to accept only those with a level of flight experience or higher education which ensured that only the most able and intelligent African-American applicants were able to join. Airman Coleman Young, later the first African-American mayor of Detroit, told journalist Studs Terkel about the process: First Lady's flight The budding flight program at Tuskegee received a publicity boost when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt inspected it on March 29, 1941, and flew with African-American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred \\"Chief\\" Anderson. Anderson, who had been flying since 1929 and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots, took his prestigious passenger on a half-hour flight in a Piper J-3 Cub. After landing, she cheerfully announced, \\"Well, you can fly all right.\\"Moye 2010, pp. 52‚Äì54. The subsequent brouhaha over the First Lady's flight had such an impact it is often mistakenly cited as the start of the CPTP at Tuskegee, even though the program was already five months old. Eleanor Roosevelt used her position as a trustee of the Julius Rosenwald Fund to arrange a loan of $175,000 to help finance the building of Moton Field. =Formation= Major James A. Ellison returns the salute of Mac Ross, as he reviews the first class of Tuskegee cadets; flight line at U.S. Army Air Corps basic and advanced flying school, with Vultee BT-13 trainers in the background, Tuskegee, Alabama, 1941 On 22 March 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was activated without pilots at Chanute Field in Rantoul, Illinois.Francis and Caso 1997, p. 15.Moye 2010, pp. 26‚Äì37. A cadre of 14 black non-commissioned officers from the 24th and 25th Infantry Regiments were sent to Chanute Field to help in the administration and supervision of the trainees. A white officer, Army Captain Harold R. Maddux, was assigned as the first commander of the 99th Fighter Squadron. A cadre of 271 enlisted men begin training in aircraft ground support trades at Chanute Field in March 1941 until they were transferred to bases in Alabama in July 1941. The skills being taught were so technical that setting up segregated classes was deemed impossible. This small number of enlisted men became the core of other black squadrons forming at Tuskegee Fields in Alabama.Moye 2010, p. 57. While the enlisted men were in training, five black youths were admitted to the Officers Training School (OTS) at Chanute Field as aviation cadets. Specifically, Elmer D. Jones, Dudley Stevenson and James Johnson of Washington, DC; Nelson Brooks of Illinois, and William R. Thompson of Pittsburgh, PA successfully completed OTS and were commissioned as the first Black Army Air Corps Officers. In June 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was transferred to Tuskegee, Alabama and remained the only Black flying unit in the country, but did not yet have pilots. The famous airmen were actually trained at five airfields surrounding Tuskegee University (formerly Tuskegee Institute)Griel, Kennedy, Moton, Shorter and Tuskegee Army Air Fields. The flying unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men\\"Fact sheet:Tuskegee Airmen\\" , National Museum of the United States Air Force website; retrieved 22 October 2010. and was backed by an entire service arm. On July 19, 1941, thirteen individuals made up the first class of aviation cadets (42-C) when they entered Preflight Training at Tuskegee Institute. After primary training at Moton Field, they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field, about to the west for conversion training onto operational types. Consequently, Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training (basic, advanced, and transition) at a single location. Initial planning called for 500 personnel in residence at a time.Moye 2010, pp. 93‚Äì94. By mid-1942, over six times that many were stationed at Tuskegee, even though only two squadrons were training there.Homan and Reilly, p. 68. War Bonds poster featuring a Tuskegee Airman Tuskegee Army Airfield was similar to already-existing airfields reserved for training white pilots, such as Maxwell Field, only distant.Francis and Caso 1997, p. 233. African-American contractor McKissack and McKissack, Inc. was in charge of the contract. The company's 2,000 workmen, the Alabama Works Progress Administration, and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months. The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057.Homan and Reilly 2001, pp. 31‚Äì32. The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., one of only two black line officers then serving. During training, Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison. Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee. However, he was transferred on 12 January 1942, reputedly because of his insistence that his African-American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local Caucasian civilians.Francis and Caso 1997, p. 56. His successor, Colonel Frederick von Kimble, then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield. Contrary to new Army regulations, Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama, a policy that was resented by the airmen. Later that year, the Air Corps replaced Kimble. His replacement had been the director of training at Tuskegee Army Airfield, Major Noel F. Parrish.Smith, Gene. \\"Colonel Parrish‚Äôs Orders.\\" American History, Volume 46, Issue 3, May/June 1995. Counter to the prevalent racism of the day, Parrish was fair and open-minded and petitioned Washington to allow the Tuskegee Airmen to serve in combat.Francis and Caso 1997, p. 258. Instrument certificate for Tuskegee Airman Robert M. Glass, signed by Parrish The strict racial segregation the U.S. Army required gave way in the face of the requirements for complex training in technical vocations. Typical of the process was the development of separate African-American flight surgeons to support the operations and training of the Tuskegee Airmen.Jones, D.R., L.P. Gross and R. Marchbanks-Robinson. \\"United States Army Aeromedical Support to African Fliers, 1941‚Äì1949: The Tuskegee Flight Surgeons\\" , SAM-FE-BR-TR-2007-0001: US Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (2007); retrieved 20 March 2010. Before the development of this unit, no U.S. Army flight surgeons had been black. Training of African-American men as aviation medical examiners was conducted through correspondence courses until 1943, when two black physicians were admitted to the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field, Texas. This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army. Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941-49. At that time, the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years. Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. The chief flight surgeon to the Tuskegee Airmen was Vance H. Marchbanks, Jr., MD, a childhood friend of Benjamin Davis. The accumulation of washed-out cadets at Tuskegee and the propensity of other commands to \\"dump\\" African-American personnel on the post exacerbated the difficulties of administering Tuskegee. A shortage of jobs for them made these enlisted men a drag on Tuskegee's housing and culinary departments.Francis and Caso 1997, p. 214. Trained officers were also left idle, as the plan to shift African-American officers into command slots stalled, and white officers not only continued to hold command, but were joined by additional white officers assigned to the post. One rationale behind the non-assignment of trained African-American officers was stated by the commanding officer of the Army Air Forces, General Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold: \\"Negro pilots cannot be used in our present Air Corps units since this would result in Negro officers serving over white enlisted men creating an impossible social situation.\\"Moye 2010, pp. 93‚Äì95. =Combat assignment= P-40 fighter aircraft The 99th was finally considered ready for combat duty by April 1943. It shipped out of Tuskegee on 2 April, bound for North Africa, where it would join the 33rd Fighter Group and its commander, Colonel William W. Momyer. Given little guidance from battle-experienced pilots, the 99th's first combat mission was to attack the small strategic volcanic island of Pantelleria, code name Operation Corkscrew, in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea lanes for the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943. The air assault on the island began 30 May 1943. The 99th flew its first combat mission on 2 June.\\"Davis Leads the 99th into Combat\\" , The National Museum of the United States Air Force; retrieved 27 July 2012.

By the end of February 1944, the all-black 332nd Fighter Group had been sent overseas with three fighter squadrons: The 100th, 301st and 302nd. Under the command of Colonel Davis, the squadrons were moved to mainland Italy, where the 99th Fighter Squadron, assigned to the group on 1 May 1944, joined them on 6 June at Ramitelli Airfield, nine kilometers south- southeast of the small city of Campomarino, on the Adriatic coast. From Ramitelli, the 332nd Fighter Group escorted Fifteenth Air Force heavy strategic bombing raids into Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland and Germany. Flying escort for heavy bombers, the 332nd earned an impressive combat record. The Allies called these airmen \\"Red Tails\\" or \\"Red-Tail Angels,\\" because of the distinctive crimson unit identification marking predominantly applied on the tail section of the unit's aircraft.Rice, Markus. \\"The Men and Their Airplanes: The Fighters\\", Tuskegee Airmen via logicalthinker2.tripod.com, 1 March 2000. A B-25 bomb group, the 477th Bombardment Group, was forming in the U.S., but was not able to complete its training in time to see action.

The bombers' target, a massive Daimler-Benz tank factory in Berlin, was heavily defended by Luftwaffe aircraft, including propeller-driven Fw 190s, Me 163 \\"Komet\\" rocket-powered fighters, and 25 of the much more formidable Me 262s, history's first operational jet fighter. Pilots Charles Brantley, Earl Lane and Roscoe Brown all shot down German jets over Berlin that day.

Pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group earned 96 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Their missions took them over Italy and enemy occupied parts of central and southern Europe. Their operational aircraft were, in succession: Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft. =Tuskegee Airmen bomber units= Formation With African-American fighter pilots being trained successfully, the Army Air Force now came under political pressure from the NAACP and other civil rights organizations to organize a bomber unit. There could be no defensible argument that the quota of 100 African-American pilots in training at one time,Moye 2010, p. 123. or 200 per year out of a total of 60,000 American aviation cadets in annual training,Francis and Caso 1997, p. 219. represented the service potential of 13 million African-Americans. On 13 May 1943, the 616th Bombardment Squadron was established as the initial subordinate squadron of the 477th Bombardment Group, an all-white group. The squadron was activated on 1 July 1943, only to be inactivated on 15 August 1943. By September 1943, the number of washed-out cadets on base had surged to 286, with few of them working. In January 1944, the 477th Bombardment Group was reactivated‚Äîan all-Black group. At the time, the usual training cycle for a bombardment group took three to four months.Moye 2010, pp. 94, 124. The 477th would eventually contain four medium bomber squadrons. Slated to comprise 1,200 officers and enlisted men, the unit would operate 60 North American B-25 Mitchell bombers. The 477th would go on to encompass three more bomber squadrons‚Äìthe 617th Bombardment Squadron, the 618th Bombardment Squadron, and the 619th Bombardment Squadron.Francis and Caso 1997, p. 457. The 477th was anticipated to be ready for action in November 1944.Homan and Reilly 2001, p. 186. The home field for the 477th was Selfridge Field, located outside Detroit, however, other bases would be used for various types of training courses. Twin-engine pilot training began at Tuskegee while transition to multi-engine pilot training was at Mather Field, California. Some ground crews trained at Mather before rotating to Inglewood. Gunners learned to shoot at Eglin Field, Florida. Bombers-navigators learned their trades at Hondo Army Air Field and Midland Air Field, Texas or at Roswell, New Mexico. Training of the new African-American crewmen also took place at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Scott Field, Belleville, Illinois. Once trained, the air and ground crews would be spliced into a working unit at Selfridge.Francis and Caso 1997, p. 207.Homan and Reilly, pp. 180‚Äì82. Command difficulties The new group's first commanding officer was Colonel Robert Selway, who had also commanded the 332nd Fighter Group before it deployed for combat overseas. Like his ranking officer, Major General Frank O'Driscoll Hunter from Georgia, Selway was a racial segregationist. Hunter was blunt about it, saying such things as, \\"...racial friction will occur if colored and white pilots are trained together.\\"Homan & Reilly 2001 pp. 184, 187 He backed Selway's violations of Army Regulation 210-10, which forbade segregation of air base facilities. They segregated base facilities so thoroughly that they even drew a line in the base theater and ordered separate seating by races. When the audience sat in random patterns as part of \\"Operation Checkerboard,\\" the movie was halted to make men return to segregated seating.Homan and Reilly 2001, pp. 185‚Äì86. African-American officers petitioned base Commanding Officer William Boyd for access to the only officer's club on base.Moye, 2010 p. 126 Lieutenant Milton Henry entered the club and personally demanded his club rights; he was court- martialed for this. Subsequently, Colonel Boyd denied club rights to African- Americans, although General Hunter stepped in and promised a separate but equal club would be built for black airmen.Moye 2010, pp. 126‚Äì27. The 477th was transferred to Godman Field, Kentucky before the club was built. They had spent five months at Selfridge but found themselves on a base a fraction of Selfridge's size, with no air-to-ground gunnery range and deteriorating runways that were too short for B-25 landings. Colonel Selway took on the second role of commanding officer of Godman Field. In that capacity, he ceded Godman Field's officers club to African-American airmen. Caucasian officers used the whites-only clubs at nearby Fort Knox, much to the displeasure of African-American officers.Moye 2010, pp. 128‚Äì29. Another irritant was a professional one for African-American officers. They observed a steady flow of white officers through the command positions of the group and squadrons; these officers stayed just long enough to be \\"promotable\\" before transferring out at their new rank. This seemed to take about four months. In an extreme example, 22-year-old Robert Mattern was promoted to captain, transferred into squadron command in the 477th days later, and left a month later as a major. He was replaced by another Caucasian officer. Meanwhile, no Tuskegee Airmen held command.Moye 2010, pp. 131‚Äì32. On 15 March 1945,Homan and Reilly 2001, p. 187. the 477th was transferred to Freeman Field, near Seymour, Indiana. The white population of Freeman Field was 250 officers and 600 enlisted men. Superimposed on it were 400 African-American officers and 2,500 enlisted men of the 477th and its associated units. Freeman Field had a firing range, usable runways, and other amenities useful for training. African-American airmen would work in proximity with white ones; both would live in a public housing project adjacent to the base.Moye 2010, p. 132 Colonel Selway turned the noncommissioned officers out of their club and turned it into a second officers club. He then classified all white personnel as cadre and all African-Americans as trainees. One officers club became the cadre's club. The old Non-Commissioned Officers Club, promptly sarcastically dubbed \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\", became the trainees' officers club. At least four of the trainees had flown combat in Europe as fighter pilots and had about four years in service. Four others had completed training as pilots, bombardiers and navigators and may have been the only triply qualified officers in the entire Air Corps. Several of the Tuskegee Airmen had logged over 900 flight hours by this time. Nevertheless, by Colonel Selway's fiat, they were trainees.Moye 2010, pp. 132‚Äì33. Off base was no better; many businesses in Seymour would not serve African-Americans. A local laundry would not wash their clothes and yet willingly laundered those of captured German soldiers. In early April 1945, the 118th Base Unit transferred in from Godman Field; its African-American personnel held orders that specified they were base cadre, not trainees. On 5 April, officers of the 477th peaceably tried to enter the whites-only officer's club. Selway had been tipped off by a phone call and had the assistant provost marshal and base billeting manager stationed at the door to refuse the 477th officers entry. The latter, a major, ordered them to leave and took their names as a means of arresting them when they refused. It was the beginning of the Freeman Field Mutiny.Moye 2010, p. 133. In the wake of the Freeman Field Mutiny, the 616th and 619th were disbanded and the returned 99th Fighter Squadron assigned to the 477th on 22 June 1945; it was redesignated the 477th Composite Group as a result. On 1 July 1945, Colonel Robert Selway was relieved of the Group's command; he was replaced by Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. A complete sweep of Selway's white staff followed, with all vacated jobs filled by African-American officers. The war ended before the 477th Composite Group could get into action. The 618th Bombardment Squadron was disbanded on 8 October 1945. On 13 March 1946, the two-squadron group, supported by the 602nd Engineer Squadron (later renamed 602nd Air Engineer Squadron), the 118th Base Unit, and a band, moved to its final station, Lockbourne Field. The 617th Bombardment Squadron and the 99th Fighter Squadron disbanded on 1 July 1947, ending the 477th Composite Group. It would be reorganized as the 332nd Fighter Wing.Homan and Reilly 2001, pp. 206‚Äì08.Francis and Caso. 1997, p. 263. =War accomplishments= Office of War Information poster In all, 992 pilots were trained in Tuskegee from 1941‚Äì1946. 355 were deployed overseas, and 84 lost their lives.\\"Escort Excellence.\\" National Museum of the United States Air Force; retrieved 12 August 2013.

Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice, got his start defending Tuskegee bomber trainees. The 477th Bombardment Group was formed in 1944 to extend the so- called \\"Tuskegee experiment\\" by allowing black aviators to serve on bomber crews. The aim was to send pilots‚Äîmany of them veterans of the original Tuskegee fighter group‚Äîback to the States for training on B-25 bombers. While in Indiana, some of the African-American officers were arrested and charged with mutiny after entering an all-white officers' club. Marshall, then a young lawyer, represented the 100 black officers who had landed in jail as a result of the confrontation. The men were soon released (although one was later convicted of violent conduct and fined).\\"History in the Headlines: The Tuskegee Airmen: 5 Fascinating Facts\\", History.com, 20 January 2012; retrieved 9 July 2012. Robert W. Williams Jr., a Navigator/Bombardier in the 477th Bombardment Group, became a Judge in the First Judicial District, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

After the war ended, James stayed in what became the Air Force and flew missions in both Korea and Vietnam. In 1969, James was put in command of Wheelus Air Base outside of Tripoli. Four Tuskegee airmen went on to become generals. For keeping his cool in the face of Qaddafi's troops, James was appointed a brigadier general by President Nixon. However, he was not the only Tuskegee graduate to make flag rank. James followed in the footsteps of Benjamin O. Davis Jr., the original commander of the 332nd Fighter Group and the first black general in the U.S. Air Force. Another Tuskegee aviator, Lucius Theus, retired a major general after dedicating most of his 36-year career in the Air Force to improving the military's bureaucracy, helping to implement a direct deposit system for service members.

Proportions are those of a .22 Long Rifle cartridge. .357 Magnum rounds. Left: Jacketed soft point (JSP) round. Right: Jacketed hollow-point (JHP) round. JSP is a semi-jacketed round as the jacket does not extend to the tip. Various hollow points: .45 Auto, .38 Special, .44 S&W; Special, .44 Remington Magnum A hollow-point bullet is a type of expanding bullet used for controlled penetration, where over-penetration could cause collateral damage (such as aboard an aircraft). In target shooting, they are used for greater accuracy due to the larger meplat. Hollow point bullets are more accurate and predictable compared to pointed bullets which, despite having a higher ballistic coefficient (BC), are more sensitive to bullet harmonic characteristics and wind deflection. Plastic-tipped bullets are a type of (rifle) bullet meant to confer the aerodynamic advantage of the spitzer bullet (for example, see very-low-drag bullet) and the stopping power of hollow point bullets. Mechanism of action 6.5√ó55mm Swedish before and after expanding. The long base and small expanded diameter show that this is a bullet designed for deep penetration on large game. The bullet in the photo traveled more than halfway through a moose before coming to rest. =Expansion= When a hollow- point hunting bullet strikes a soft target, the pressure created in the pit forces the material (usually lead) around the inside edge to expand outwards, increasing the axial diameter of the projectile as it passes through. This process is commonly referred to as mushrooming, because the resulting shape, a widened, rounded nose on top of a cylindrical base, typically resembles a mushroom. The greater frontal surface area of the expanded bullet limits its depth of penetration into the target, and causes more extensive tissue damage along the wound path. Many hollow-point bullets, especially those intended for use at high velocity in centerfire rifles, are jacketed, i.e. a portion of the lead-cored bullet is wrapped in a thin layer of harder metal, such as copper, brass, or mild steel. This jacket provides additional strength to the bullet, increases penetration, and can help prevent it from leaving deposits of lead inside the bore. In controlled expansion bullets, the jacket and other internal design characteristics help to prevent the bullet from breaking apart; a fragmented bullet will not penetrate as far. =Accuracy= A fired .38 Special hollow-point bullet viewed from the side, showing the intended terminal ballistics sometimes referred to as mushrooming An expanded 124-grain 9√ó19mm Luger jacketed hollow-point For bullets designed for target shooting, some such as the Sierra \\"Matchking\\" incorporate a cavity in the nose, called the meplat. This allows the manufacturer to maintain a greater consistency in tip shape and thus aerodynamic properties among bullets of the same design, at the expense of a slightly decreased ballistic coefficient and higher drag. The result is a slightly decreased overall accuracy between bullet trajectory and barrel direction, as well as an increased susceptibility to wind drift, but closer grouping of subsequent shots due to bullet consistency, often increasing the shooter's perceived accuracy. The manufacturing process of hollow-point bullets also produces a flat, uniformly-shaped base on the bullet which allegedly increases accuracy by providing a more consistent piston surface for the expanding gases of the cartridge. Match or target hollow-point bullets are designed for precision target use and no consideration is given to their expansion or other terminal ballistic performance. The United States military uses open-tip ammunition in some sniper rifles due to its exceptional accuracy. This ammunition is arguably not prohibited by military convention in that the wounds that it produces are similar to full metal jacket ammunition in practice. Hollow-point boat-tail A hollow-point boat-tail bullet is a match-grade bullet design that uses the concept of a teardrop-shaped tail to give it a lower drag coefficient and make it produce less turbulence in its wake. Only the base of the bullet has a boat tail-like shape ‚Äì the meplat is still pointed. Some hollow-point boat-tail bullets with longer, more aerodynamic profiles are known as very-low-drag bullets. =Testing= Three fired .22 caliber hollow-point bullets, recovered after being fired into water. To the left is a bullet of the same type that has not been fired. Terminal ballistics testing of hollow point bullets is generally performed in ballistic gelatin, or some other medium intended to simulate tissue and cause a hollow point bullet to expand. Test results are generally given in terms of expanded diameter, penetration depth, and weight retention. Expanded diameter is an indication of the size of the wound cavity, penetration depth shows if vital organs could be reached by the bullet, and weight retention indicates how much of the bullet mass fragmented and separated from the main body of the bullet. How these factors are interpreted depends on the intended use of the bullet, and there are no universally agreed-upon ideal metrics. History Solid lead bullets, when cast from a soft alloy, will often deform and provide some expansion if they hit the target at a high velocity. This, combined with the limited velocity and penetration attainable with muzzleloading firearms, meant there was little need for extra expansion. The first hollow-point bullets were marketed in the late 19th century as express bullets, and were hollowed out to reduce the bullet's mass and provide higher velocities. In addition to providing increased velocities, the hollow also turned out to provide significant expansion, especially when the bullets were cast in a soft lead alloy. Originally intended for rifles, the popular .32-20, .38-40, and .44-40 calibers could also be fired in revolvers. With the advent of smokeless powder, velocities increased, and bullets got smaller, faster, and lighter. These new bullets (especially in rifles) needed to be jacketed to handle the conditions of firing. The new full metal jacket bullets tended to penetrate straight through a target causing less internal damage than a bullet that expands and stops in its target. This led to the development of the soft point bullet and later jacketed hollow-point bullets at the British arsenal in Dum Dum, near Calcutta around 1890. Designs included the .303\\" Mk III, IV & V and the .455\\" Mk III \\"Manstopper\\" cartridges. Although such bullet designs were quickly outlawed for use in warfare (in 1898, the Germans complained they breached the Laws of War), they steadily gained ground among hunters due to the ability to control the expansion of the new high velocity cartridges. In modern ammunition, the use of hollow points is primarily limited to handgun ammunition, which tends to operate at much lower velocities than rifle ammunition (on the order of versus over 2,000 feet per second). At rifle velocities, a hollow point is not needed for reliable expansion and most rifle ammunition makes use of tapered jacket designs to achieve the mushrooming effect. At the lower handgun velocities, hollow point designs are generally the only design which will expand reliably. Modern hollowpoint bullet designs use many different methods to provide controlled expansion, including: * Jackets that are thinner near the front than the rear to allow easy expansion at the beginning, then a reduced expansion rate. * Partitions in the middle of the bullet core to stop expansion at a given point. * Bonding the lead core to the copper jacket to prevent separation and fragmentation. * Fluted or otherwise weakened jackets to encourage expansion or fragmentation. * Posts in the hollow cavity to cause hydraulic expansion of the bullet in tissue. While very effective in lightly clothed targets, these bullet types tend to plug up with heavy clothing materials that results in the bullet not expanding. * Solid copper hollow points, which are far stronger than jacketed lead, and provide controlled, uniform expansion even at high velocities. * Plastic inserts in the hollow, which provide the same profile as a full-metal-jacketed round (such as the Hornady V-Max bullet). The plastic insert initiates the expansion of the bullet by being forced into the hollow cavity upon impact. * Plastic inserts in the hollow to provide the same profile for feeding in semiautomatic and automatic weapons as a full-metal-jacketed round but that separate on firing while in flight or in the barrel (such as the German Geco \\"Action Safety\\" 9 mm round) File:Hollow point.JPG9√ó19mm Parabellum hollow point File:22-45.jpg.45 ACP Federal HST 230gr hollow point cartridge, with two rounds of CCI Standard Velocity .22 LR for comparison purposes File:40SW.jpg.40 S&W; round, complete cartridge and expanded bullet File:Federal 9mm hollow point.jpgA 9mm hollow point cartridge, along with unexpanded and expanded bullets. The expanded lead bullet and copper jacket are separated. Legality The Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibited the use in international warfare of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body. It is a common misapprehension that hollow-point ammunition is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions, as the prohibition significantly predates those conventions. The Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868 banned exploding projectiles of less than 400 grams, along with weapons designed to aggravate injured soldiers or make their death inevitable. Despite the widespread ban on military use, hollow-point bullets are one of the most common types of bullets used by civilians and police,U.S. Social Security orders 174,000 hollow-point bullets. World ‚Äì CBC News which is due largely to the reduced risk of bystanders being hit by over-penetrating or ricocheted bullets, and the increased speed of incapacitation. In many jurisdictions, even ones such as the United Kingdom, where expanding and any other kind of ammunition is only allowed to a Firearms Licence holder, it is illegal to hunt certain types of game with ammunition that does not expand. =United Kingdom= Most ammunition types, including hollow-point bullets, are only allowed to a Section 1 Firearms Certificate holder. The Firearms Certificate Holder must have the calibre in question as a valid allowance on his or her licence. A valid FAC or Firearms Certificate allows the holder to use Ball, FMJ, Hollow Point and Ballistic tipped ammunition for range use and vermin control. A Firearms Licence will only be issued to any individual who can provide good reason to the police for the possession of firearms and its ammunition. Until recently all expanding ammunition fell under Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 and was only allowed when conditions were entered onto an FAC holders licence by the police. This condition would allow expanding ammunition to be used for: * the lawful shooting of deer * the shooting of vermin or, in the case of carrying on activities in connection with the management of any estate, other wildlife * the humane killing of animals * the shooting of animals for the protection of other animals or humans Some ammunition types are still prohibited under Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968. Ammunition that explodes on impact or any ammunition that is intended for military use are examples of this. Popular calibres used in the UK for vermin, fox and deer control are as follows: .223 Remington, .243 Winchester, .308 Winchester, .22-250 amongst others, all using Hollow-point bullets. Many Rimfire calibres are also using expanding ammunition such as .22 Long Rifle, .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire and .17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire. =United States= The United States is one of few major powers that did not agree to IV-3 of the Hague Convention of 1899, and thus is able to use this kind of ammunition in warfare, but the United States ratified the second (1907) Hague Convention IV-23, which says \\"To employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering\\", similar to IV-3 of the first Convention. For years the United States military respected this Convention and refrained from the use of expanding ammunition, and even made special FMJ .22LR ammunition for use in High Standard pistols that were issued to the OSS agents and the Savage Model 24 .22/.410 combination guns issued in the E series of air crew survival kits. After announcing consideration of using hollow point ammunition for side arms, with a possible start date of 2018, the United States Army began production of M1153 special purpose ammunition for the 9√ó19mm Parabellum with a jacketed hollow point bullet at per second for use in situations where limited over-penetration of targets is necessary to reduce collateral damage. The state of New Jersey bans possession of hollow point bullets by civilians, except for ammunition possessed at one's own dwellings, premises, or other lands owned or possessed, or for, while and traveling to and from hunting with a hunting license if otherwise legal for the particular game. The law also requires all hollow point ammunition to be transported directly from the place of purchase to one's home or premises, or hunting area, or by members of a rifle or pistol club directly to a place of target practice, or directly to an authorized target range from the place of purchase or one's home or premises. Winchester Black Talon controversy Detail image of a Black Talon bullet In early 1992, Winchester introduced the \\"Black Talon\\", a newly designed hollow-point handgun bullet which used a specially designed, reverse tapered jacket. The jacket was cut at the hollow to intentionally weaken it, and these cuts allowed the jacket to open into six petals upon impact. The thick jacket material kept the tips of the jacket from bending as easily as a normal thickness jacket. The slits that weakened the jacket left triangular shapes in the tip of the jacket, and these triangular sections of jacket would end up pointing out after expansion, leading to the \\"Talon\\" name. The bullets were coated with a black colored, paint-like lubricant called \\"Lubalox,\\" and loaded into nickel-plated brass cases, which made them visually stand out from other ammunition. While performance of the Black Talon rounds was not significantly better than any other comparable high performance hollow-point ammunition, the reverse taper jacket did provide reliable expansion under a wide range of conditions, and many police departments adopted the round. Winchester's \\"Black Talon\\" product name was eventually used against them. After the high-profile 1993 101 California Street shooting in San Francisco, media response against Winchester was swift. \\"This bullet kills you better\\", says one report; \\"its six razorlike claws unfold on impact, expanding to nearly three times the bullet's diameter\\". A concern was raised by the president of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) that the sharp edges of the jacket could cut medical personnels‚Äô skin and risk spread of disease. An ACEP spokesman later said he was not aware of any such cases. Cited in Winchester responded to the media criticism of the Black Talon line by removing it from the commercial market and only selling it to law enforcement distributors. Winchester has since discontinued the sale of the Black Talon entirely, although Winchester does manufacture very similar ammunition, the Ranger T-Series and the Supreme Elite Bonded PDX1. Terminology The hollow point and soft-nosed bullets are both sometimes also referred to as dum-dums, so named after the British arsenal at Dum Dum, in present north Kolkata, India, where it is said jacketed, expanding bullets were first developed. This term is rare in North America, but can still be found in use, usually in the news media and sensational popular fiction, as well as in video games (such as Crimson Skies). Many shooters refer to hollow points as \\"JHPs\\", from the common manufacturer's abbreviation for \\"jacketed hollow point\\".

Holland joined the Irish Christian Brothers in Limerick and taught in Limerick (CBS Sexton Street) and many other centres in the country including North Monastery CBS in Cork City, St. Mary's CBS, Portlaoise, St Joseph's CBS (Drogheda) and as the first Mathematics teacher in Colaiste Ris (also Dundalk). Due to ill health, he left the Christian Brothers in 1873.Profile, clarelibrary.ie, 9 August 1996. Holland immigrated to the United States in 1873. Initially working for an engineering firm, he returned to teaching again for a further six years in St. John's Catholic school in Paterson, New Jersey. Development of submarine designs After his arrival in the United States, Holland slipped and fell on an icy Boston street and broke a leg. While recuperating from the injury in a hospital, he used his time to refine his submarine designs and was encouraged by Isaac Whelan, a priest.\\"John P. Holland: An Appreciation,\\" Daily Alaska Empire. 3 September 1914. p. 5. Retrieved 2 September 2014. In 1875, his submarine designs were submitted for consideration by the US Navy but were turned down as unworkable. The Fenians (Irish revolutionaries), however, continued to fund Holland's research and development expenses at a level that allowed him to resign from his teaching post. In 1878 he demonstrated the Holland I prototype. In 1881, Fenian Ram was launched but, soon after, Holland and the Fenians parted company on bad terms over the issue of payment within the Fenian organisation, and between the Fenians and Holland.Davies, R. Nautilus: The Story of Man Under the Sea. Naval Institute Press (1995); . The submarine is now preserved at Paterson Museum, New Jersey. Holland stands in the hatch of a submarine. Holland continued to improve his designs and worked on several experimental boats that were not accepted by the US Navy, including Plunger. He was eventually succeeded with a privately built type initially named Holland VI, launched on 17 May 1897. This was the first submarine having power to run submerged for any considerable distance, and the first to combine electric motors for submerged travel and gasoline engines for use on the surface. She was purchased by the US Navy, on 11 April 1900, after rigorous tests and was commissioned on 12 October 1900 as USS Holland. Seven more of her type were ordered with five built at the Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey and two built at Union Iron Works in California. The company that emerged from under these developments was called The Electric Boat Company, founded on 7 February 1899. Isaac Leopold Rice became the company's first president, with Elihu B. Frost acting as vice-president and chief financial officer. This company eventually evolved into the major defence contractor General Dynamics. The USS Holland design was also adopted by others, including the Royal Navy in developing the . The first five submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy used a modified version of the basic design, although these boats were at least 10 feet longer at about 63 feet. These submarines were also developed at the Fore River Ship and Engine Company in Quincy, Massachusetts. Holland also designed the Holland II and Holland III prototypes. The Royal Navy 'Holland 1' is on display at the Submarine Museum, Gosport, England. Death After spending 56 of his 73 years working with submersibles, John Philip Holland died on August 12, 1914 in Newark, New Jersey. He is interred at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Totowa, New Jersey.

Holland was built at former Navy Lieutenant Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard of Elizabeth, New Jersey for John Holland's Holland Torpedo Boat Company, which became the Electric Boat company in 1899. The vessel was built under the supervision of John Philip Holland, who designed the vessel and her details. Hollands keel was laid at Nixon's Crescent Shipyard with both men present. The two men worked together using many of John Holland's proven concepts and patents to make the submarine a reality, each man complementing the other's contributions to the development of the modern submarine. John Holland was the inventor for US Patent 702,729 for the design of a submarine boat.https://patents.google.com/patent/US702729A/ Important contributions were also made by Arthur L. Busch (or Du Busc), Crescent's superintendent. Holland VI included many features that submarines of the early 20th century would exhibit, albeit in later, more advanced forms. There was a conning tower from which the boat and her weapons could be directed. Also, she had all the necessary ballast and trim tanks to make precise changes in depth and attitude underwater. Her crew was six men and maximum diving depth was .Friedman, p. 306 For armament, she had a reloadable 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tube with three torpedoes and an pneumatic dynamite gun in the bow (the dynamite gun's projectiles were called \\"aerial torpedoes\\").Bauer and Roberts, p. 253 A second dynamite gun in the stern was removed in 1900 to make room for an improved engine exhaust, prior to delivery to the Navy.Friedman, p. 25 She had both an internal combustion engine (specifically, a 4-stroke Otto gasoline engine of ) for running on the surface and charging batteries, and an Electro Dynamic electric motor of for submerged operation, with one shaft.Gardiner and Gray, pp. 126-127 A 66-cell Exide battery powered the electric motor when submerged.

Navy gives horsepower figures of surfaced and submerged, with surfaced and submerged. Service Holland VI eventually proved her validity and worthiness as a warship and was ultimately purchased by the U.S. government for the sum of $150,000 on 11 April 1900. She was considered to be the first truly successful craft of her type. The United States Government soon ordered more submarines from Holland's company, which were to be known as the . These became America's first fleet of underwater naval vessels. USS Holland (SS-1) from Scientific American 1898. The muzzle door of the bow dynamite gun is open. Holland VI was modified after her christening, and was renamed USS Holland (SS-1) when she was commissioned by the US Navy on 12 October 1900, at Newport, Rhode Island, with Lieutenant Harry H. Caldwell in command. Holland was the first commissioned submarine in the US NavyMorris and is the first of the unbroken line of submarines in the Navy. She was the fourth submarine to be owned by the Navy, however. (The first submarine was Propeller (also known as Alligator), the second was Intelligent Whale and the third was Plunger, an experimental submarine, built in 1895, which is not to be confused with USS Plunger (SS-2). Holland under construction, 1900 On 16 October 1900, in order to be kept serviceable throughout the winter, Holland left Newport under tow of the tug Leyden for Annapolis, Maryland, where she was used to train midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy, as well as officers and enlisted men ordered there to receive training vital in preparing for the operation of other submarines being built for the Fleet. Holland proved valuable for experimental purposes in collecting data for submarines under construction or contemplation. Her surface run, from Annapolis to Norfolk, Virginia from 8‚Äì10 January 1901, provided useful data on her performance underway over an extended period. Holland (briefly in 1899, on trials) and five Holland-type submarines were based in New Suffolk, New York on the North Fork of Long Island from 1899‚Äì1905, prompting the hamlet to claim to be the first submarine base in the United States. Except for the period from 15 June to 1 October 1901, which was passed training cadets at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, Holland remained at Annapolis as a training submarine until 17 July 1905 when she was decommissioned. Holland finished her career in reserve at Norfolk, Virginia. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 November 1910. This revolutionary submarine was sold as scrap to Henry A. Hitner & Sons of Philadelphia on 18 June 1913 for $100. Her purchaser was required to put up $5,000 bond as assurance that the submarine would be broken up and not used as a ship.

She appears in the non-canon Legends series as the wife of Luke Skywalker and mother of Ben Skywalker. She has been voiced by Heidi Shannon, Edie Mirman and Kath Soucie in various Star Wars video games. Concept and development Her first appearance was in Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire (1991). Zahn imagined Jade as a strong, complex female character, somebody he thought lacking in the Star Wars universe. While competent, she is flawed. When the Thrawn trilogy ended in 1993 with The Last Command, Zahn thought it was the last book for which he would develop the character. Asked to write another novel, he established two goals: \\"to end the war between the New Republic and the Empire, and to get Luke Skywalker and Mara together.\\" Although Lucasfilm resisted the idea of Luke marrying Mara, they eventually acquiesced. In 2018, Zahn said Lucasfilm gave him some creative control over the character of Mara Jade: any appearance of Mara in new works requires Zahn's approval. Zahn also explained the Lucasfilm Story Group also had the authority to prevent him from incorporating Mara back into the canon, and any appearance would have to be approved by both parties. Zahn said he would only allow her to appear if she plays an important role in the plot, and he would block any kind of cameo. Previously, the character of Grand Admiral Thrawn, another Zahn creation, made the jump from Legends to canon, albeit with a slightly-reworked story. Subsequently, Zahn said he hoped to find a way to bring Mara into the canon, stating \\"If there was a generic, or organic, spot for her to fit into a story... I promise people, I will pitch it to the Lucasfilm story group, and then, it's their decision whether to allow it or not.\\" Compared to Star Wars sole iconic female character, Princess Leia, Zahn said, \\"Mara has a sharper and sarcastic manner, and of course, she had to go through the painful realization her service was to an evil cause. But both women are strong without sacrificing their femininity, a balance which I think some authors have trouble writing. Bear in mind, too, Leia was one of the first people in the New Republic who decided Mara could be trusted, which perhaps says something about their understanding of each other.\\"  Appearances  Mara is introduced as smuggler Talon Karrde's second-in-command in Heir to the Empire. The novel establishes she was previously an \\"Emperor's Hand\\"‚Äîa special agent‚Äîfor Emperor Palpatine. Several stories depict Jade before the events in Heir to the Empire, showing her training under Palpatine and executing his orders. The Thrawn trilogy depicts Mara's first confrontation with Luke Skywalker, whom she swears to kill to avenge Palpatine's death (Palpatine sent her a faked image of Luke and Vader turning on him together, rather than Vader killing Palpatine, and the demand for Luke's death motivated by Palpatine's desire for revenge against his father rather than Luke's actions). This was re-inforced by the Emperor's final telepathic command to assassinate Luke, plaguing her thoughts since his death; upon learning this situation, Luke vowed to help Mara break Palpatine's hold on her, regardless of the danger she posed to him. Toward the end of the trilogy, she turns against the Empire, and resolves her anger toward Luke, and silences the command without killing him, instead killing Luke's clone ‚Äî Luuke Skywalker ‚Äî made by the Dark Jedi Joruus C'baoth to challenge Luke. In doing so, she took Anakin Skywalker's blue lightsaber (which Luuke was using), and used it instead of Luke's green lightsaber to defeat C'baoth. At the close of The Last Command, Luke gives her Anakin's lightsaber because he believed she earned it, but because he truly wanted her to have it. Over the course of the series, Luke recognizes in Mara an underdeveloped affinity for the Force; and although she initially resists Jedi training, she eventually becomes a Jedi Master. Luke and Mara develop a strong bond in Zahn's The Hand of Thrawn Duology; he proposes marriage, and the two wed in Michael A. Stackpole's graphic novel Union. She delivers a son, Ben, during The New Jedi Order series. In the Legacy of the Force series, Mara is suspicious of her nephew, Jacen Solo, after he sends Ben on several ethically-dubious missions. Upon learning Jacen is a Sith apprentice, Mara vows to kill him, but Jacen ultimately kills her in Sacrifice. She later appears as a Force ghost, first to Ben then to Luke, in Revelation. She also appears as a Force ghost to Cade Skywalker in the Legacy comics, set more than a century after the Star Wars films. = Other appearances = Mara also appears in the short story Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade, by Timothy Zahn, in the anthology Tales from Jabba's Palace. In this story, she infiltrates Jabba the Hutt's palace as a dancing girl to assassinate Luke Skywalker under orders of the Emperor, but misses her chance after Jabba drops him into the Rancor's lair then escapes. Mara was portrayed by model Shannon McRandle (as Shannon Baksa) on several cards in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game. She is a playable character in Star Wars: Masters of Ter√§s K√§si,. Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith, Star Wars: Empire at War and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (Wii version). Meeting her was also a mission objective in the defunct massively multiplayer online game Star Wars Galaxies. She also narrates the Imperial campaign in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds. She was portrayed by Denise Donovan in the Team Starkid musical parody Ani.  Canonicity  In 2008, franchise creator George Lucas said that there would be no sequel trilogy and that plot elements from the Expanded Universe were not part of the overall story, including that \\"Luke doesn't get married\\". With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were re-branded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014. Reception Mara Jade was chosen by IGN as the 19th top Star Wars character. IGNs Jesse Schedeen also listed the character as the top 10th Star Wars hero, noting she \\"entered the Expanded Universe early, and she stuck around for so long because she's just a great character\\". UGO Networks called the character the seventh top Star Wars Expanded Universe character, calling her complex. In 2006, Zahn called Mara and Thrawn his favorite characters out of those he created. In a 1998 Star Wars Insider poll of fans' favorite Star Wars characters, Mara was the only expanded universe character to break the top 20. In 2006, Zahn called Mara and Grand Admiral Thrawn his favorite characters out of those he created, saying \\"Mara, with her attitude and her Jedi skills, is just plain fun to write, especially in opposition‚Äîor in partnership‚Äîwith Luke.\\" References External links * Category:Star Wars Legends characters Category:Star Wars literary characters Category:Star Wars Jedi characters Category:Fictional female assassins Category:Fictional aviators Category:Fictional empaths Category:Fictional telekinetics Category:Fictional secret agents and spies Category:Fictional super soldiers Category:Fictional swordsmen Category:Fictional women soldiers and warriors Category:Literary characters introduced in 1991 Category:Fictional special forces personnel Category:Soldiers in science fiction Category:Fictional smugglers Category:Space pirates Category:Fictional regents Category:Fictional female martial artists Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional dancers Category:Fictional information brokers ","title":"Mara Jade"},{"id":"71791","text":"Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man is a novel by Siegfried Sassoon, first published in 1928 by Faber and Faber. It won both the Hawthornden Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, being immediately recognised as a classic of English literature. In the years since its first appearance, it has regularly been a set text for British schoolchildren.Macmillan Background Prior to its publication, Siegfried Sassoon's reputation rested entirely on his poetry, mostly written during and about World War I. Only ten years after the war ended, after some experience of journalism, did he feel ready to branch out into prose. So uncertain was he of the wisdom of this move that he elected to publish Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man anonymously. It is a depiction of his early years presented in the form of an autobiographical novel, with false names being given to the central characters, including Sassoon himself, who appears as \\"George Sherston\\". Sassoon was motivated to write the work by a war incident, when a fox was loose in the trenches and one of his friends shot and killed it. However, the book draws heavily on his pre-war life, with riding and hunting being among the favourite pastimes of the author. Much of the material for the novel came from Sassoon's own diaries. He said he was inspired by the work of Marcel Proust, saying, \\"A few pages of Proust have made me wonder whether insignificant episodes aren't the most significant\\". In particular, his relationship with \\"Aunt Evelyn\\", a fictionalised representation of his mother Theresa, is revealed as having been a major influence in his upbringing. Plot The story is a series of episodes in the youth of George Sherston, ranging from his first attempts to learn to ride to his experiences in winning point-to-point races. The title is somewhat misleading, as the book is mainly concerned with a series of landmark events in Sherston/Sassoon's childhood and youth, and his encounters with various comic characters. \\"The Flower-Show Match\\", an account of an annual village cricket match ‚Äì an important fixture for those involved ‚Äì in which young Sherston plays a significant part, was later published separately by Faber as a self-contained story.Open Library The book as a whole is a frequently humorous work, in which fox-hunting, one of Sassoon's major interests, comes to represent the young man's innocent frame of mind in the years before war broke out. The book ends with his enlistment in a local regiment, the Sussex Yeomanry, and his subsequent transfer, with a commission, to the Flintshire Fusiliers, a battalion of the Royal Welsh which was sent to France. The story is continued in two sequels: Memoirs of an Infantry Officer and Sherston's Progress.

Although he also became a businessman, soldier and politician who represented three different counties in the Virginia General Assembly following the American Revolutionary War, Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now Kentucky. Although on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains from most European-American settlements, Kentucky remained part of Virginia until it became a state in 1792. As a young adult, Boone supplemented his farm income by hunting and trapping game, and selling their pelts in the fur market. Through this work, Boone first learned the easy routes westward. Despite some resistance from Native American tribes such as the Shawnee, in 1775, Boone blazed his Wilderness Road from North Carolina and Tennessee through the Cumberland Gap in the Cumberland Mountains into Kentucky. There, he founded the village of Boonesborough, Kentucky, one of the first American settlements west of the Appalachians. By the end of the 18th century, more than 200,000 Americans migrated to Kentucky/Virginia by following the route marked by Boone.For number of people, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 351. Boone served as a militia officer during the Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì83), which, in Kentucky, was fought primarily between the American settlers and British-allied Native Americans, who hoped to expel the Americans. Shawnee warriors captured Boone in 1778. He escaped and alerted Boonesborough that the Shawnee were planning an attack. Although heavily outnumbered, Americans repelled the Shawnee warriors in the Siege of Boonesborough. Boone was elected to the first of his three terms in the Virginia General Assembly during the war, and fought in the Battle of Blue Licks in 1782. Blue Licks, a Shawnee victory over the Patriots, was one of the war's last battles, coming after the main fighting ended in October 1781.Michael C. C. Adams, \\"An Appraisal of the Blue Licks Battle,\\" Filson Club History Quarterly (2001) 75#2 181‚Äì203. After the war, Boone worked as a surveyor and merchant, but fell deeply into debt through failed Kentucky land speculation. He briefly moved back to Virginia, in the newly formed Kanawha County, but returned to Kentucky. Once again frustrated with the legal problems resulting from his land claims, in 1799 Boone emigrated to eastern Missouri, where he spent most of the last two decades of his life. Boone remains an iconic figure in American history. He was a legend in his own lifetime, especially after an account of his adventures was published in 1784, framing him as the typical American frontiersman. After his death, Boone became the subject of many heroic tall tales and works of fiction. His adventures‚Äîreal and legendary‚Äîhelped create the archetypal frontier hero of American folklore. In American popular culture, Boone is still remembered as one of the foremost early frontiersmen, even if the epic mythology often overshadows the historical details of Boone's life.For overview of Boone as early folk hero and American icon, as well as his enduring fame and the confusion of myth and history, see Lofaro, American Life, 180‚Äì83. Early life Boone was born on October 22, 1734, the sixth of eleven children.Brown, Meredith Mason. Frontiersman, 4. Because the Gregorian calendar was adopted during Boone's lifetime, his birth date is sometimes given as November 2, 1734 (the \\"New Style\\" date), although Boone always used the October date. He was the sixth of eleven children in a family of Quakers. His father, Squire Boone (1696‚Äì1765), had emigrated to Pennsylvania from the small town of Bradninch, England in 1713. Squire Boone's parents George and Mary Boone followed their son to Pennsylvania in 1717, and in 1720 built a log cabin at Boonecroft. Note: This includes In 1720, Squire, who worked primarily as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700‚Äì1777), whose family were Quakers from Wales. In 1731, the Boones built a log cabin in the Oley Valley in what is now Berks County, Pennsylvania, near present Reading, where Daniel was born.For Boone's use of October date, see Bakeless, Master of the Wilderness, 7. Boone spent his early years on what was then the edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good relations with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 9. In Boone's youth, his family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community. In 1742, Boone's parents were compelled to publicly apologize after their eldest child Sarah married a \\"worldling\\", or non-Quaker, while she was visibly pregnant. When Boone's oldest brother Israel also married a \\"worldling\\" in 1747, Squire Boone stood by his son and was therefore expelled from the Quakers, although his wife continued to attend monthly meetings with her children. Perhaps as a result of this controversy, in 1750 Squire sold his land and moved the family to North Carolina. Daniel Boone did not attend church again, although he always considered himself a Christian and had all of his children baptized. The Boones eventually settled on the Yadkin River, in what is now Davie County, North Carolina, about two miles (3 km) west of Mocksville.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 25‚Äì27; Bakeless, Master of the Wilderness, 16‚Äì17. For baptizing children, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 311. Because Boone grew up on the frontier, he had little formal education, but gained deep knowledge of the woods. According to one family tradition, a schoolteacher once expressed concern over Boone's education, but Boone's father said, \\"Let the girls do the spelling and Dan will do the shooting.\\" Boone received some tutoring from family members, though his spelling remained unorthodox. Historian John Mack Faragher cautions that the folk image of Boone as semiliterate is misleading, and argues that he \\"acquired a level of literacy that was the equal of most men of his times.\\" Boone regularly took reading material with him on his hunting expeditions‚Äîthe Bible and Gulliver's Travels were favorites. He was often the only literate person in groups of frontiersmen. Boone would sometimes entertain his hunting companions by reading to them around the evening campfire.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 16‚Äì17, 55‚Äì6, 83. =French and Indian War= After the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763) broke out between the French and British, and their respective Indian allies, North Carolina Governor Matthew Rowan called up a militia, for which Boone volunteered. He served under Captain Hugh Waddell on the North Carolina frontier. Waddell's unit was assigned to serve in the command of General Edward Braddock in 1755, and Boone acted as a wagoner, along with his cousin Daniel Morgan, who would later be a key general in the American Revolution. Braddock's campaign ended in disaster at the Battle of the Monongahela, the denouement of the campaign and a bitter defeat for the British. While on the campaign, Boone met John Findley, a packer who worked for George Croghan in the trans-Appalachian fur trade. Findley first interested Boone in the abundance of game and other natural wonders of the Ohio Valley. Findley took Boone on his first fateful hunting trip to Kentucky 12 years later. =Marriage and family= Boone returned home and on August 14, 1756, he married Rebecca Bryan, a neighbor in the Yadkin River Valley. Her brother married one of Boone's sisters. The couple initially lived in a cabin on his father's farm. They eventually had 10 children. Boone supported his growing family in these years as a market hunter and trapper, collecting pelts for the fur trade. Almost every autumn, Boone would go on \\"long hunts\\", extended expeditions into the wilderness lasting weeks or months. Boone went alone or with a small group of men, accumulating hundreds of deer skins in the autumn, and trapping beaver and otter over the winter. The hunt followed a network of bison migration trails, known as the Medicine Trails. When the long hunters returned in the spring, they sold their take to commercial fur traders.For market hunting, see Bakeless, Master of the Wilderness, 38‚Äì39. Robert Morgan's biography of Boone says that according to legend, Boone was away for two years, and during that time Rebecca had a daughter. Historian Lyman Draper said Rebecca, believing Boone was dead, had a relationship with his brother Ned, and Boone accepted the daughter as if she were his. Frontiersmen often carved messages on trees or wrote their names on cave walls, and Boone's name or initials have been found in many places. A tree in present Washington County, Tennessee, reads \\"D. Boon Cilled a. Bar on tree in the year 1760\\". A similar carving, preserved in the museum of the Filson Historical Society in Louisville, Kentucky, reads \\"D. Boon Kilt a Bar, 1803.\\" The inscriptions may also be among numerous forgeries of the famous trapper, part of a long tradition of phony Boone relics.For doubts about tree carvings, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 57‚Äì58; Belue's notes in Draper, Life of Daniel Boone,163, 286; Elliott, Long Hunter, 12. For historians who do not doubt the tree carvings, see Lofaro, American Life, 18; Bakeless, Master of the Wilderness, 33. Faragher and Belue generally question traditional stories more than Bakeless, Elliott, and Lofaro. =Cherokee conflict, temporary move to Virginia= In 1758, a conflict erupted between the British forces and the Cherokee, their allies in the French and Indian War (which continued in other parts of the continent). After the Yadkin River Valley was raided by Cherokee, the Boones and many other families fled north to Culpeper County, Virginia. Boone served in the North Carolina militia during this \\"Cherokee Uprising\\". His militia expeditions went deep into Cherokee territory beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains and he was separated from his wife for about two years. In 1762, Boone, his wife and four children moved back to the Yadkin River Valley from Culpeper. By the mid-1760s, with peace made with the Cherokee, colonial immigration into the area increased. The competition of new settlers decreased the amount of game available. Boone had difficulty making ends meet; he was often taken to court for nonpayment of debts. He sold his land to pay off creditors. After his father's death in 1765, Boone traveled with his brother Squire and a group of men to Florida, which had become British territory after the end of the war, to look into the possibility of settling there. According to a family story, Boone purchased land near Pensacola, but Rebecca refused to move so far away from her friends and family. The Boones moved to a more remote area of the Yadkin River Valley, and Boone began to hunt westward into the Blue Ridge Mountains.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 62‚Äì66. Kentucky \\"Capture of Boone and Stuart\\" from Life and Times of Col. Daniel Boone by Cecil B. Hartley (1859) Boone first reached Kentucky in the fall of 1767 while on a long hunt with his brother Squire Boone, Jr. Boone's first steps in Kentucky were near present-day Elkhorn City. While on the Braddock expedition years earlier, Boone had heard about the fertile land and abundant game of Kentucky from fellow wagoner John Findley, who had visited Kentucky to trade with American Indians. Boone and Findley happened to meet again, and Findley encouraged Boone with more tales of Kentucky. At the same time, news had arrived about the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, in which the Iroquois had ceded their claim to Kentucky to the British. This, as well as the unrest in North Carolina due to the Regulator Movement, likely prompted Boone to extend his exploration.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 69‚Äì74. According to some versions of the story, Findley specifically sought out Boone in 1768, but Faragher believes it more likely that their second meeting was by chance. On May 11, 1769, he began a two-year hunting expedition in Kentucky. On December 22, 1769, Boone and a fellow hunter, Benjamin Cutbirth, were captured by a party of Shawnees, who confiscated all of their skins and told them to leave and never return. The Shawnees had not signed the Stanwix treaty, and since they regarded Kentucky as their hunting ground, they considered white hunters there to be poachers. Boone, however, continued hunting and exploring Kentucky until his return to North Carolina in 1771, and returned to hunt there again in the autumn of 1772. On July 5, 1773, Boone packed up his family and, with a group of about 50 immigrants, began the first attempt by British colonists to establish a settlement in Kentucky. Boone was still an obscure hunter and trapper at the time; the most prominent member of the expedition was William Russell, a well- known Virginian and future brother-in-law of Patrick Henry. On October 9, Boone's eldest son James and a small group of men and boys who had left the main party to retrieve supplies were attacked by a band of Delawares, Shawnees, and Cherokees. Following the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, American Indians in the region had been debating what to do about the influx of settlers. This group had decided, in the words of historian John Mack Faragher, \\"to send a message of their opposition to settlement\\". James Boone and William Russell's son Henry were captured and gruesomely tortured to death. The brutality of the killings sent shock waves along the frontier, and Boone's party abandoned its expedition.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 89‚Äì96, quote on 93. George Caleb Bingham's Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap (1851‚Äì52) is a famous depiction of Boone. The massacre was one of the first events in what became known as Dunmore's War, a struggle between Virginia and, primarily, Shawnees of the Ohio Country for control of what is now West Virginia and Kentucky. In the summer of 1774, Boone volunteered to travel with a companion to Kentucky to notify surveyors there about the outbreak of war. The two men journeyed more than in two months to warn those who had not already fled the region. Upon his return to Virginia, Boone helped defend colonial settlements along the Clinch River, earning a promotion to captain in the militia, as well as acclaim from fellow citizens. After the brief war, which ended soon after Virginia's victory in the Battle of Point Pleasant in October 1774, the Shawnees relinquished their claims to Kentucky.For Boone in Dunmore's War, see Lofaro, American Life, 44‚Äì49; Faragher, Daniel Boone, 98‚Äì106. Following Dunmore's War, Richard Henderson, a prominent judge from North Carolina, hired Boone to travel to the Cherokee towns in present North Carolina and Tennessee and inform them of an upcoming meeting. In the 1775 treaty, Henderson purchased the Cherokee claim to Kentucky to establish a colony called Transylvania. Afterward, Henderson hired Boone and Cutbirth to blaze what became known as the Wilderness Road, which went through the Cumberland Gap and into central Kentucky. Along with a party of about 30 workers, Boone and Cutbirth marked a path to the Kentucky River, where they founded Boonesborough. Other settlements, notably Harrodsburg, were also established at this time. Despite occasional Indian attacks, Boone returned to the Clinch Valley and brought his family and other settlers to Boonesborough on September 8, 1775.When, exactly, Henderson hired Boone has been a matter of speculation by historians. Some have argued that Boone's first expeditions into Kentucky might have been financed by Henderson in exchange for information about potential places for settlement, while Boone's descendants believed Henderson did not hire Boone until 1774. For doubts that Henderson hired Boone before 1774, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 74‚Äì76, 348. American Revolution Abduction of Boone's Daughter, painting by Karl Ferdinand Wimar, 1855/56, Amon Carter Museum of American Art Violence in Kentucky increased with the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783). Native Americans who were unhappy about the loss of Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance to drive out the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 130. On July 14, 1776, Boone's daughter Jemima and two other teenaged girls were captured outside Boonesborough by an Indian war party, who carried the girls north toward the Shawnee towns in the Ohio country. Boone and a group of men from Boonesborough followed in pursuit, finally catching up with them two days later. Boone and his men ambushed the Indians while they were stopped for a meal, rescuing the girls and driving off their captors. The incident became the most celebrated event of Boone's life. James Fenimore Cooper created a fictionalized version of the episode in his classic novel The Last of the Mohicans (1826).For Boone's influence on James Fenimore Cooper, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 331; Bakeless, Master of the Wilderness, 139. In 1777, Henry Hamilton, British Lieutenant Governor of Canada, began to recruit American Indian war parties to raid the Kentucky settlements. On April 24, Shawnee Indians led by Chief Blackfish attacked Boonesborough. Boone was shot in the ankle while outside the fort but, amid a flurry of bullets, he was carried back inside by Simon Kenton, a recent arrival at Boonesborough.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 147‚Äì47. Kenton became Boone's close friend, as well as a legendary frontiersman in his own right., Explore, Fall-Winter 2003 While Boone recovered, Shawnees kept up their attacks outside Boonesborough, killing cattle and destroying crops. With the food supply running low, the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat they had, so in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the Licking River.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 154. On February 7, when Boone was hunting meat for the expedition, he was surprised and captured by warriors led by Blackfish. Because Boone's party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned the next day with Blackfish and persuaded his men to surrender rather than put up a fight.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 155‚Äì59. Blackfish wanted to continue to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that the women and children were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.Bakeless, Master of the Wilderness, 167. Illustration of Boone's ritual adoption by the Shawnees, from Life & Times of Col. Daniel Boone, by Cecil B. Hartley (1859) Boone and his men were taken to Blackfish's town of Chillicothe, where they were made to run the gauntlet. As was their custom, the Shawnees adopted some of the prisoners into the tribe to replace fallen warriors; the remainder were taken to Hamilton in Detroit. Boone was adopted into a Shawnee family at Chillicothe, perhaps into the family of Chief Blackfish himself, and given the name Sheltowee (Big Turtle). On June 16, 1778, when he learned Blackfish was about to return to Boonesborough with a large force, Boone eluded his captors and raced home, covering the to Boonesborough in five days on horseback and, after his horse gave out, on foot.Boone biographers write that Boone was adopted by the chief, but see Chief Blackfish for doubts. During Boone's absence, his wife and children (except for Jemima) had returned to North Carolina, assuming he was dead. Upon his return to Boonesborough, some of the men expressed doubts about Boone's loyalty, since after surrendering the salt-making party, he had apparently lived quite happily among the Shawnees for months. Boone responded by leading a preemptive raid against the Shawnees across the Ohio River, and then by helping to successfully defend Boonesborough against a 10-day siege led by Blackfish, which began on September 7, 1778. After the siege, Captain Benjamin Logan and Colonel Richard Callaway‚Äîboth of whom had nephews who were still captives surrendered by Boone‚Äîbrought charges against Boone for his recent activities. In the court-martial that followed, Boone was found \\"not guilty\\", and was even promoted after the court heard his testimony. Despite this vindication, Boone was humiliated by the court martial, and he rarely spoke of it.For court martial, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 199‚Äì202; Lofaro, American Life, 105‚Äì106. After the trial, Boone returned to North Carolina to bring his family back to Kentucky. In the autumn of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including (according to tradition) the family of Abraham Lincoln's grandfather.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 203, writes without qualification that the Lincolns joined Boone on this trip, while Lofaro calls it a tradition. Other sources give a later date for the Lincoln migration; see Captain Abraham Lincoln. Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of Boone's Station. He began earning money at this time by locating good land for other settlers. Transylvania land claims had been invalidated after Virginia created Kentucky County, so settlers needed to file new land claims with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash from various settlers and traveled to Williamsburg to purchase their land warrants. While he was sleeping in a tavern during the trip, the cash was stolen from his room. Some of the settlers forgave Boone the loss; others insisted he repay the stolen money, which took him several years to do. A popular image of Boone which emerged in later years is that of the backwoodsman who had little affinity for \\"civilized\\" society, moving away from places like Boonesborough when they became \\"too crowded\\". In reality, however, Boone was a leading citizen of Kentucky at this time. When Kentucky was divided into three Virginia counties in November 1780, Boone was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Fayette County militia. In April 1781, he was elected as a representative to the Virginia General Assembly, which was held in Richmond. In 1782, he was elected sheriff of Fayette County.For Boone as a leading citizen, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 206. Jury finding from Kentucky County, Virginia, confiscating lands of two men adjudged to be British subjects ‚Äì Daniel Boone was listed as member of the jury (July 1780) Meanwhile, the American Revolutionary War continued. Boone joined General George Rogers Clark's invasion of the Ohio country in 1780, fighting in the Battle of Piqua against the Shawnee, who were allied with the British, on August 7. In October 6, Boone and his younger brother Edward \\"Ned\\" Boone were returning from a trip to the Blue Licks to make salt and to do some hunting, they stopped along a stream in Bourbon County to rest and let their horses drink. Ned sat down by the stream near an old Buckeye tree to crack nuts, and while Daniel went into the woods in pursuit of a bear, the lurking Shawnees shot and killed Ned. Realized they had been ambushed, Boone looked back and saw them gathered around Ned's body and heard them saying that they have killed Daniel Boone. Boone fled, and managing to find a canebrake to hide in, he shot one of the pursuing Shawnees' hunting dogs. He fled deeper into the brake. Apparently thinking that they had killed Daniel Boone, the Shawnees beheaded Ned and took the head home as a trophy, to prove that they had really killed Daniel Boone. Boone eventually made it to Boone's Station by morning, and led a party back to the location where Ned had been shot, and found a wildcat chewing on his brother's headless body. Daniel and the others in the party buried Ned near an old buckeye tree and followed the trail to the Ohio River, but did not pursue the Indians across the Ohio. In 1781, Boone traveled to Richmond to take his seat in the legislature, but British dragoons under Banastre Tarleton captured Boone and several other legislators near Charlottesville. The British released Boone on parole several days later. During Boone's term, Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, but the fighting continued in Kentucky unabated. Boone returned to Kentucky and in August 1782 fought in the Battle of Blue Licks against Loyalists and Native Americans, in which his son Israel was killed. In November 1782, Boone took part in another Clark expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war. Businessman and politician from the Ohio River valley After the Revolutionary War ended, Boone resettled in Limestone, then a booming Ohio River port within Virginia, although across the Appalachian Mountains. During the next decade, fellow trans-Appalachian settlers (many of them fellow veterans) would three times elect Boone to represent them (part time) in the Virginia General Assembly in Richmond, although he represented a different county each time (since increased settlement led to the formation of new counties and ultimately the new state of Kentucky in 1791). Virginia and Pennsylvania had long claimed westward lands, and Virginia only relinquished its claims to those north of the Ohio River to permit creation of the Northwest Territory in 1787. A celebrity, Boone kept a tavern in Limestone, and also worked as a surveyor, horse trader and land speculator. On his 50th birthday (in 1784), settler and historian John Filson published The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke, a book which included a chronicle of Boone's adventures. Settlers first elected Boone as one of their two representatives from what was then called Fayette County, Virginia, the year after legislators had split \\"Kentucky County\\" into three counties. Thus, Boone served alongside Thomas Swearingen representing Fayette County in the Virginia House of Delegates sessions of May 7 ‚Äì June 23, 1781, and again from October 1, 1781 until January 5, 1782. However, by May 1782 Fayette County voters selected two other men (John Mosby and Robert Johnson) as their delegates.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly, 1619‚Äì1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978) p. 145 As settlers moved westward, the border war with American Indians north of the Ohio River resumed, now sometimes called the Northwest Indian War. In September 1786, Boone took part in a military expedition into what was then called the \\"Ohio Country\\" led by fellow Virginia and Kentucky militia Col. Benjamin Logan. Returning to Limestone, Boone housed and fed Shawnees who were captured during the raid, and helped to negotiate a truce and prisoner exchange. Although the war escalated and would not end until the American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers eight years later, the 1786 expedition was the last time Boone saw military action.For border war and prisoner exchanges, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 249‚Äì58. Most Boone biographers tell a story of Blue Jacket, the Shawnee chief, escaping while in Boone's custody in Limestone, and suggest that Boone intentionally let the chief escape because the two men were friends. According to the scholarly biography of Blue Jacket, however, the chief escaped at a later time: see John Sugden, Blue Jacket: Warrior of the Shawnees (University of Nebraska Press, 2000), 82. The following year, he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates a second time, this time as a representative from Bourbon County, alongside John Grant, and the legislative session ran from October 15, 1787, until January 8, 1788. Again, voters (this time from Bourbon County) selected two different men for the sessions in 1788, namely Notley Conn and Henry Lee.Leonard p. 164 Boone was initially prosperous, owning seven slaves by 1787 (a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time),Faragher, Daniel Boone, 235‚Äì37. but began to have financial troubles while living in Limestone. According to the later folk image, Boone the trailblazer was too unsophisticated for the civilization which followed him and which eventually defrauded him of his land. However, Boone was not the simple frontiersman of legend: he engaged in land speculation on a large scale, buying and selling claims to tens of thousands of acres. The land market in frontier Kentucky was chaotic, and Boone's ventures ultimately failed because his investment strategy was faulty.Original stated \\"Boone's sense of honor made him reluctant to profit at someone else's expense.\\" Given that Boone owned slaves, as the paragraph's opening stated, he clearly had no issue profiting at someone else's expense. One recent biographer opined that Boone lacked the ruthless instincts that speculation demanded.For analysis of Boone's land speculation failures, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 245‚Äì48. Frustrated with the legal hassles that went with land speculation, in 1788, Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). There he operated a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor's assistant. When Virginia created Kanawha County in 1789 (having formally consented to Kentucky's statehood in 1788 and 1789 but the U.S. Congress having delayed in passing appropriate legislation), Boone became the lieutenant colonel of the county militia.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 266. In 1791, Boone for the third time won election to the Virginia House of Delegates, this time representing Kanawha County alongside George Clendenin. Again voters replaced both delegates for the next legislative session in Richmond; Henry Banks and William Morris were elected (but Virginia legislators refused to seat Banks, finding that he did not live in Kanawha County).Leonard pp. 184, 188 and n.3Faragher, Daniel Boone, 267. Boone also contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 268‚Äì70. In 1795, Boone and his wife moved back to Kentucky, this time to land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone in what became Nicholas County. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first governor of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route. However, someone else won the contract.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 272‚Äì73. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued to make their way through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 273. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 274. Missouri this home near present-day Defiance, Missouri. This engraving by Alonzo Chappel (circa 1861) depicts an elderly Boone hunting in Missouri. A portrait of Boone by John James Audubon, circa after 1810. Having endured legal and financial setbacks, Boone sought to make a fresh start by leaving the United States. In 1799, he moved his extended family to what is now St. Charles County, Missouri, but was then part of Spanish Louisiana.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 274‚Äì78. The Spanish, eager to promote settlement in the sparsely populated region, did not enforce the official requirement that all immigrants had to be Roman Catholic. The Spanish governor appointed Boone \\"syndic\\" (judge and jury) and commandant (military leader) of the Femme Osage district.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 279. The many anecdotes of Boone's tenure as syndic suggest he sought to render fair judgments rather than to strictly observe the letter of the law.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 285‚Äì86. Boone served as syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri became part of the United States following the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 304‚Äì05. Boone spent his final years in Missouri, often in the company of children and grandchildren, where he continued to hunt and trap as much as his health and energy levels permitted. According to one story, in 1810 or later, Boone went with a group on a long hunt as far west as the Yellowstone River, a remarkable journey at his age, if true. In 1816, a United States officer at Fort Osage, on the Missouri, wrote: Stories were told of Boone making one last visit to Kentucky to pay off his creditors, although some or all of these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the woods of Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he never returned to Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.For Yellowstone, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 295. For doubts about Audubon's tale, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 308‚Äì10; Randell Jones, In the Footsteps of Daniel Boone, 222. For historians who report Audubon's story without doubts, see Lofaro, American Life, 161‚Äì66; Bakeless, Master of the Wilderness, 398‚Äì99. Death Purported resting place of Rebecca and Daniel Boone, Frankfort, Kentucky Daniel Boone died of natural causes (other sources say from acute indigestion) on the morning of September 26, 1820, at his son Nathan Boone's home on Femme Osage Creek, Missouri, at age 85, five weeks short of his 86th birthday. His last words were, \\"I'm going now. My time has come.\\" He was buried next to Rebecca, who had died on March 18, 1813, in the Old Bryan Farm Cemetery. The graves, which were unmarked until the mid-1830s, were near Jemima (Boone) Callaway's home on Tuque Creek, about two miles (3 km) from the present-day Marthasville, Missouri. In 1845, the Boones' remains were supposedly disinterred and reburied in a new cemetery, Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Resentment in Missouri about the disinterment grew over the years, and a legend arose that Boone's remains never left Missouri. According to this story, Boone's tombstone in Missouri had been inadvertently placed over the wrong grave, but no one had ever corrected the error. Boone's relatives in Missouri, displeased with the Kentuckians who came to exhume Boone, kept quiet about the mistake, and they allowed the Kentuckians to dig up the wrong remains. No contemporary evidence indicates this actually happened, but in 1983, a forensic anthropologist examined a crude plaster cast of Boone's skull made before the Kentucky reburial and announced it might be the skull of an African American. Black slaves had also been buried at Tuque Creek, so it is possible the wrong remains were mistakenly removed from the crowded graveyard. Both the Frankfort Cemetery in Kentucky and the Old Bryan Farm in Missouri claim to have Boone's remains.For burial controversy, see Faragher, Daniel Boone, 354‚Äì62; Jones, Footsteps, 227‚Äì30. The Kentucky Legislature appropriated two thousand dollars in 1860 for the erection of a monument over the grave of Daniel Boone in Frankfort.Daniel Boone: American Pioneer and Frontiersman By Pat McCarthy, page 83 The monument at Boone's grave site today was built by John Haley in 1860.http://www.frankfortpublicart.com/images/docsAndLinks/boone/Daniel%20Boones%20Monument.pdf In 1862 four marble panels were added depicting scenes from Daniel and Rebecca's lives. The panels were vandalized during the American Civil War and restored in 1906. Only one of the original panels still exists. Cultural legacy The Daniel Boone Bicentennial half-dollar is a U.S. commemorative coin issued from 1934 to 1938 in honor of the bicentennial of Boone's birth Daniel Boone remains an iconic figure in American history, although his status as an early American folk hero and later as a subject of fiction has tended to obscure the actual details of his life. Many places in the United States are named for him, including the Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky and the Sheltowee Trace Trail in Tennessee. Daniel Boone, 1968 issue Daniel Boone was honored with a 6-cent stamp in the American Folklore Series on September 26, 1968, at Frankfort, Kentucky, where his remains were supposedly reburied. He was a famous frontiersman in the development of Virginia, Kentucky and the trans-Appalachian west. A wall of roughly-hewn boards displays the tools of Boone's trade‚Äîa Pennsylvania rifle, a powder horn, and a knife. The pipe tomahawk represents that the Shawnees had adopted Boone. His name and birth date were carved on the wall.\\"1968 American Folklore Issue\\", Arago: people, postage & the post, National Postal Museum online, viewed March 16, 2014. =Emergence as a legend= Boone emerged as a legend in large part because of land speculator John Filson's \\"The Adventures of Colonel Daniel Boon\\", part of his book The Discovery, Settlement and present State of Kentucke. First published in 1784, Filson's book was primarily intended to popularize Kentucky to immigrants. It was soon translated into French and German, and made Boone famous in America and Europe. Based on interviews with Boone, Filson's book contained a mostly factual account of Boone's adventures from the exploration of Kentucky through the American Revolution. However, because the real Boone was a man of few words, Filson invented florid, philosophical dialogue for this \\"autobiography\\". Subsequent editors cut some of these passages and replaced them with more plausible‚Äîbut still spurious‚Äîones. Often reprinted, Filson's book established Boone as one of the first popular heroes of the United States.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 4‚Äì7; Lofaro, American Life, 180. Like John Filson, Timothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky (1833) became one of the best- selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint greatly embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington. In Flint's book, Boone fought hand-to-paw with a bear, escaped from Indians by swinging on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 323‚Äì24. =Symbol and stereotype= This 1874 lithograph entitled \\"Daniel Boone protects his family\\" is a representative image of Boone as an Indian fighter. Thanks to Filson's book, in Europe, Boone became a symbol of the \\"natural man\\" who lives a virtuous, uncomplicated existence in the wilderness. This was most famously expressed in Lord Byron's epic poem Don Juan (1822), which devoted a number of stanzas to Boone, including this one: Byron's poem celebrated Boone as someone who found happiness by turning his back on civilization. In a similar vein, many folk tales depicted Boone as a man who migrated to more remote areas whenever civilization crowded in on him. In a typical anecdote, when asked why he was moving to Missouri, Boone supposedly replied, \\"I want more elbow room!\\" Boone rejected such an interpretation of his life, however. \\"Nothing embitters my old age,\\" he said late in life, like \\"the circulation of absurd stories that I retire as civilization advances...\\"Faragher, Daniel Boone, 302, 325‚Äì26. Existing simultaneously with the image of Boone as a refugee from society was, paradoxically, the popular portrayal of him as civilization's trailblazer. Boone was celebrated as an agent of Manifest Destiny, a pathfinder who tamed the wilderness, paving the way for the extension of American civilization. In 1852, critic Henry Tuckerman dubbed Boone \\"the Columbus of the woods\\", comparing Boone's passage through the Cumberland Gap to Christopher Columbus's voyage to the New World. In popular mythology, Boone became the first to explore and settle Kentucky, opening the way for countless others to follow. In fact, other Americans had explored and settled Kentucky before Boone, as debunkers in the 20th century often pointed out, but Boone came to symbolize them all, making him what historian Michael Lofaro called \\"the founding father of westward expansion\\".Faragher, Daniel Boone, 321‚Äì22, 350‚Äì52; Lofaro, American Life, 181‚Äì82. In the 19th century, when Native Americans were being displaced from their lands and confined on reservations, Boone's image was often reshaped into the stereotype of the belligerent, Indian-hating frontiersman which was then popular. In John A. McClung's Sketches of Western Adventure (1832), for example, Boone was portrayed as longing for the \\"thrilling excitement of savage warfare.\\" Boone was transformed in the popular imagination into someone who regarded Indians with contempt and had killed scores of the \\"savages\\". The real Boone disliked bloodshed, however. According to historian John Bakeless, there is no record that Boone ever scalped Indians, unlike other frontiersmen of the era. Boone once told his son Nathan that he was certain of having killed only one Indian, during the battle at Blue Licks, although he believed others might have died from his bullets in other battles. Even though Boone had lost two sons in wars with Indians, he respected Indians and was respected by them. In Missouri, Boone often went hunting with the very Shawnees who had captured and adopted him decades earlier. Some 19th-century writers regarded Boone's sympathy for Indians as a character flaw and therefore altered his words to conform to contemporary attitudes.Bakeless, Master of the Wilderness, 162‚Äì62; Faragher, Daniel Boone, 39, 86, 219, 313, 320, 333. =In fiction= Boone's adventures, real and mythical, formed the basis of the archetypal hero of the American West, popular in 19th-century novels and 20th-century films. The main character of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, the first of which was published in 1823, bore striking similarities to Boone; even his name, Nathaniel Bumppo, echoed Daniel Boone's name. As mentioned above, The Last of the Mohicans (1826), Cooper's second Leatherstocking novel, featured a fictionalized version of Boone's rescue of his daughter. After Cooper, other writers developed the Western hero, an iconic figure which began as a variation of Daniel Boone.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 330‚Äì33. In the 20th century, Boone was featured in numerous comic strips, radio programs, and films, such as the 1936 film Daniel Boone, with George O'Brien playing the title role. Daniel Boone was the subject of a TV series that ran on NBC from 1964 to 1970. In the theme song for the series, Boone was described as a \\"big man\\" in a \\"coonskin cap\\", and the \\"rippin'est, roarin'est, fightin'est man the frontier ever knew!\\"The complete lyrics of the song can be found online . This did not describe the real Boone, who was not a big man and did not wear a coonskin cap. Boone was portrayed this way because Fess Parker, the tall actor who played him, was essentially reprising his role as Davy Crockett from an earlier TV series. That Boone could be portrayed the same way as Crockett, another American frontiersman with a very different personality, was another example of how Boone's image was reshaped to suit popular tastes.Faragher, Daniel Boone, 338‚Äì39, 362; Lofaro, American Life, 180. =Descendants= Boone's grandson Alphonso Boone was an early settler of the Willamette River Valley in Oregon, arriving in 1846 and establishing Boones Ferry the next year. Three generations of Boone's descendants have been Major League Baseball players: Ray Boone, Ray's son Bob Boone, and Ray's grandchildren Bret Boone and Aaron Boone.

The shopping mall welcomes visitors daily.Les Halles, the new heart of Paris Les Halles, the new heart of Paris A major reconstruction of the mall was undertaken in 2010, and the new version of the Forum des Halles was inaugurated in 2018.Des Racines des Alles: \\"Le nouveau coeur de Paris\\", 12 March 2015 The 2.5 hectare Canop√©e was opened on 5 April 2016,Paris-Les Halles Les Halles redevelopment project.

A bishop briefly took control of the market before sharing control with Louis VI in 1137. In 1183, Philip Augustus took full control of the market and built two market halls - halles - to protect the textiles. He also built walls around the market, including land which had recently been confiscated from exiled Jews. When he then built walls around the city, these embraced the market, which quickly became the city's largest (and, over time, went from being at the edge of the city to at its center). Officially, it would remain a dry goods market for centuries, but food stalls soon grew up around the main buildings and by the fifteenth century food prices at les Halles were being cited as significant for the whole city. The market would have ups and downs over the coming centuries and was rebuilt more than once. Over time, an increasing number of halls were built explicitly for food, but the dry goods market remained central to the (increasingly cramped) space. =The wholesale market= The church of Saint-Eustache was constructed in the 16th century. The circular Halle aux Bl√©s (Corn Exchange), designed by Nicolas Le Camus de M√©zi√®res, was built between 1763 and 1769 at the west end of Les Halles. Its circular central court was later covered with a dome, and it was converted into the Bourse de Commerce in 1889.Parimage, \\"Les Halles, The New Heart of Paris\\". Mairie de Paris and SemPariSeine, July 2012. In the 1850s, Victor Baltard designed the famous glass and iron structure which would house les Halles for over a century and became one of the sights of Paris; this would last until the 1970s. Now entirely a food market, the remodeled market was known as the \\"Belly of Paris\\", as √âmile Zola called it in his novel Le Ventre de Paris, which is set in the busy marketplace of the 19th century. Les Halles during the razing in 1971 =Major conversion= Unable to compete in the new market economy and in need of massive repairs, the colourful ambience once associated with the bustling area of merchant stalls disappeared in 1971, when Les Halles was dismantled; the wholesale market was relocated to the suburb of Rungis. Two of the glass and cast iron market pavilions were dismantled and re-erected elsewhere; one in the Paris suburb of Nogent-sur- Marne, the other in Yokohama, Japan. The site was to become the point of convergence of the RER, a network of new express underground lines which was completed in the 1960s. Three lines leading out of the city to the south, east and west were to be extended and connected in a new underground station. For several years, the site of the markets was an enormous open pit, nicknamed \\"le trou des Halles\\" (trou = hole), regarded as an eyesore at the foot of the historic church of Saint-Eustache. Construction was completed in 1977 on Ch√¢telet-Les-Halles, Paris's new urban railway hub. The Forum des Halles, a partially underground multiple story commercial and shopping center, designed by Claude Vasconi and Georges Pencreac'h, opened at the east end of the site on September 4, 1979 in presence of the Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac, and remains there today. A public garden covering four hectares opened in 1986. Many of the surrounding streets were pedestrianized. =Paris Les Halles= Underground rail system in Ch√¢telet-Les Halles Gare de Ch√¢telet ‚Äì Les Halles is Paris's busiest rail station, serving 750,000 travelers on an average weekday. The buildings and their surroundings have been criticized for their design. In 2002 Mayor Bertrand Delano√´ announced that the City of Paris would begin public consultations regarding the remodeling of the area, calling Les Halles \\"a soulless, architecturally bombastic concrete jungle\\".Riding, Alan. \\"For Paris, the Newest Look Is a Canopy\\". New York Times, July 7, 2007. Accessed December 25, 2012 A design competition for the Forum and gardens was held, with entries from Jean Nouvel, Winy Maas, David Mangin, and Rem Koolhaas. Mangin's design for the gardens, which proposed replacing the landscaped mounds and paths of the 1980s design with a simplified pattern of east-west pedestrian promenades and a large central lawn, was selected. The plan also includes extending the pedestrianized area further east to include all the streets bordering the gardens. Another competition was held for the redesign of the Forum. Ten teams submitted plans, and the proposal by Patrick Berger and Jacques Anziutti was selected in 2007. Their design includes a large undulating glass canopy which will cover the redesigned Forum. STIF and RATP began plans for the remodeling of the Ch√¢telet-Les-Halles station in 2007, and the following year Berger and Anziutti were awarded a contract for redesign of the station. The station redesign includes new entrances on Rue Berger, Rue Rambuteau, and Place Marguerite de Navarre, an expanded RER concourse, and improved pedestrian circulation. Construction began in 2010 on a project which includes the gardens, Forum, and station, and is scheduled to continue through 2016. The clients are the City of Paris, RATP, which operates the Paris Metro, and La Soci√©t√© Civile du Forum des Halles de Paris, which operates the Forum.

Its population was 57,233 in the 2010 census, making Chapel Hill the 15th-largest city in the state. Chapel Hill, Durham, and the state capital, Raleigh, make up the corners of the Research Triangle (officially the Raleigh‚ÄìDurham‚ÄìChapel Hill combined statistical area), with a total population of 1,998,808. The town was founded in 1793 and is centered on Franklin Street, covering . It contains several districts and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and UNC Health Care are a major part of the economy and town influence. Local artists have created many murals. History The area was the home place of early settler William Barbee of Middlesex County, Virginia, whose 1753 grant of 585 acres from John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville was the first of two land grants in what is now the Chapel Hill-Durham area. Though William Barbee died shortly after settling there, one of his eight children, Christopher Barbee, became an important contributor to his father's adopted community and to the fledgling University of North Carolina. Franklin and Rosemary streets Chapel Hill has developed along a hill; the crest was the original site of a small Anglican \\"chapel of ease\\", built in 1752, known as New Hope Chapel. The Carolina Inn now occupies this site. In 1819, the town was founded to serve the University of North Carolina and developed around it. The town was chartered in 1851, and its main street, Franklin Street, was named in memory of Benjamin Franklin. In 1969, a year after the city fully integrated its schools, Chapel Hill elected Howard Lee as mayor. It was the first majority-white municipality in the South to elect an African-American mayor. Serving from 1969 to 1975, Lee helped establish Chapel Hill Transit, the town's bus system. Some 30 years later, in 2002, the state passed legislation to provide free service to all riders on local buses. The bus operations are funded through Chapel Hill and Carrboro town taxes, federal grants, and UNC student tuition. The change has resulted in a large increase in ridership, taking many cars off the roads. Several hybrid and articulated buses have been added recently. All buses carry GPS transmitters to report their location in real time to a tracking web site. Buses can transport bicycles and have wheelchair lifts. In 1993, the town celebrated its bicentennial and founded the Chapel Hill Museum. This cultural community resource \\"exhibiting the character and characters of Chapel Hill, North Carolina\\" includes among its permanent exhibits Alexander Julian, History of the Chapel Hill Fire Department, Chapel Hill's 1914 Fire Truck, The James Taylor Story, Farmer/James Pottery, and The Paul Green Legacy. In addition to the Carolina Inn, the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity House, Chapel Hill Historic District, Chapel Hill Town Hall, Chapel of the Cross, Gimghoul Neighborhood Historic District, Alexander Hogan Plantation, Old Chapel Hill Cemetery, Old East, University of North Carolina, Playmakers Theatre, Rocky Ridge Farm Historic District, and West Chapel Hill Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography and climate Chapel Hill is located in the southeast corner of Orange County. It is bounded on the west by the town of Carrboro and on the northeast by the city of Durham. However, most of Chapel Hill's borders are adjacent to unincorporated portions of Orange and Durham Counties rather than shared with another municipality. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is covered by water. Demographics Durham, North Carolina, is the core of the four-county Durham-Chapel Hill MSA, which has a population of 504,357 as of Census 2010. The US Office of Management and Budget also includes Chapel Hill as a part of the Raleigh-Durham-Cary Combined Statistical Area, which has a population of 1,749,525 as of Census 2010. Effective June 6, 2003, the Office of Management and Budget redefined the federal statistical areas and dismantled what had been for decades the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill MSA, and split them into two separate MSAs, though the region functions as a single metropolitan area. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, 57,233 people in 20,564 households resided in Chapel Hill. The population density was 2,687 people per square mile (1037/km). The racial composition of the town was 72.8% White, 9.7% African American, 0.3% Native American, 11.9% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 2.7% some other race, and 2.7% of two or more races. About 6.4% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race. Of the 20,564 households, 51.1% were families, 26.2% of all households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.2% were headed by married couples living together, 8.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.9% were not families. About 30.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.98. In the town, the population was distributed as 17.4% under the age of 18, 31.5% from 18 to 24, 23.6% from 25 to 44, 18.4% from 45 to 64, and 9.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 25.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 87.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.6 males. According to estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau, over the three-year period of 2005 through 2007, the median income for a household in the town was $51,690, and for a family was $91,049. Males had a median income of $50,258 versus $32,917 for females. The per capita income for the town was $35,796. About 8.6% of families and 19.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.6% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over. Chapel Hill is North Carolina's best-educated municipality, proportionately, with 77% of adult residents (25 and older) holding an associate degree or higher, and 73% of adults possessing a baccalaureate degree or higher.U.S. Census Bureau. 2008 American Community Survey Government Chapel Hill uses a council- manager form of government. The community elects a mayor and eight council members. Mayors serve two-year terms, and council members serve staggered four-year terms. Mayor Pam Hemminger, a former board of education member, was elected in 2015 and re-elected in 2017. She defeated incumbent Mark Kleinschmidt, who in 2009 had been elected the first openly gay mayor of Chapel Hill, succeeding outgoing four-term Mayor Kevin Foy. The town adopted its flag in 1990. According to flag designer Spring Davis, the blue represents the town and the University of North Carolina (whose colors are Carolina blue and white); the green represents \\"environmental awareness\\"; and the \\"townscape\\" in the inverted chevron represents \\"a sense of home, friends, and community.\\" The current version of the town's seal, adopted in 1989, is in the process of being replaced with a similar but simpler version. All versions of the seal, dating back to the 1930s, depict Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and protector of cities. Education The Chapel Hill-Carrboro school district covers most of the towns of Chapel Hill and Carrboro, along with portions of unincorporated Orange County, and is recognized for its academic strengths. East Chapel Hill High School, Carrboro High School, and Chapel Hill High School have all received national recognition for excellence, with Newsweek in 2008 ranking East Chapel Hill High as the 88th-best high school in the nation, and the highest-ranked standard public high school in North Carolina. The small portion of Chapel Hill located in Durham County is part of Durham Public Schools. There are several private K-12 schools in Chapel Hill, including Emerson Waldorf School. The state's main youth orchestra, Piedmont Youth Orchestra, is based in Chapel Hill. Culture Chapel Hill fire truck, painted with the colors of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Though Chapel Hill is a principal city of a large metropolitan area, it retains a relatively small-town feel. Combined with its close neighbor, the Chapel Hill-Carrboro area has roughly 85,000 residents. Many large murals can be seen painted on the buildings. Most of these murals were painted by UNC alumnus Michael Brown. Also, for more than 30 years, Chapel Hill has sponsored the annual street fair, Festifall, in October. The fair offer booths to artists, craftsmakers, nonprofits, and food vendors. Performance space is also available for musicians, martial artists, and other groups. The fair is attended by tens of thousands each year. The Sorrell building on Franklin Street has housed a movie theater (currently called the Varsity Theatre) since its construction in 1927. A variety of corporations are headquartered in Chapel Hill. Health insurance provider Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina was one of the town's 10 largest employers. Technology companies USAT Corp and Realtime Ops have made Chapel Hill their headquarters location. Journalistic, Inc., the publisher of the nationally acclaimed magazines Fine Books & Collections, QSR, and FSR recently relocated from Durham to Chapel Hill. New companies are selecting the town as their base of operations such as the service company Alpha Install. The Morehead Planetarium was the first planetarium built on a U.S. college campus. When it opened in 1949, it was one of six planetariums in the nation and has remained an important town landmark. During the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs, astronauts were trained there. One of the town's hallmark features is the giant sundial, located in the rose gardens in front of the planetarium on Franklin Street. Influences of the university are seen throughout the town, even in the fire departments. Each fire station in Chapel Hill has a fire engine (numbers 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35) that is Carolina blue. These engines are also decorated with different UNC decals, including a firefighter Rameses. Chapel Hill also has some new urbanist village communities, such as Meadowmont Village and Southern Village. Meadowmont and Southern Village both have shopping centers, green space where concerts and movies take place, community pools, and schools. Also, a traditional-style mall with a mix of national and local retailers is located at University Place. In 2009, Chapel Hill ranked number three on Newsmax magazine's list of the \\"Top 25 Most Uniquely American Cities and Towns\\", a piece written by current CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg. According to the magazine, Greenberg based the rankings on a variety of features, such as quality of schools and proximity to medical care, as well as culture, hospitality, and scenic beauty. =Food= Hailed as one of America's Foodiest Small Towns by Bon App√©tit, Chapel Hill is rapidly becoming a hot spot for pop American cuisine. Among the restaurants noted nationally are Al's Burger Shack, A Southern Season, Foster's Market (Martha Stewart's Living), Mama Dip's (Food Network's \\"$40 A Day With Rachael Ray\\"), Crook's Corner, Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen (The Splendid Table), caff√® Driade (Food Network's \\"$40 A Day With Rachael Ray\\"), Lantern Restaurant (Food & Wine magazine, Southern Living magazine, etc.), and Vimala's Curryblossom Cafe. =Music= Chapel Hill also has a vibrant music scene. Classical composers on the faculty of UNC Chapel Hill include Allen Anderson, Stefan Litwin, and Lee Weisert. In the realm of popular music, James Taylor, George Hamilton IV, Southern Culture on the Skids, Superchunk, Polvo, Ben Folds Five, The Kingsbury Manx, and more recently Porter Robinson, are among the most notable musical artists and acts whose careers began in Chapel Hill. The town has also been a center for the modern revival of old-time music with such bands as the Ayr Mountaineers, Hollow Rock String band, Mandolin Orange, the Tug Creek Ramblers, Two Dollar Pistols, the Fuzzy Mountain String band, Big Fat Gap and the Red Clay Ramblers. Chapel Hill was also the founding home of now Durham-based Merge Records. Bruce Springsteen has made a point to visit the town on four occasions. His most recent appearance was on September 15, 2003, at Kenan Memorial Stadium with the E Street Band. U2 also performed at Kenan on the first American date of their 1983 War Tour, where Bono climbed up to the top of the stage, during pouring rain and lightning, holding up a white flag for peace. The 2011 John Craigie song, \\"Chapel Hill\\", is about the singer's first visit there. One song from Dirty, a Sonic Youth album, is named after the town. =Sports= The University of North Carolina has been very successful at college basketball and women's soccer, and a passion for these sports has been a distinctive feature of the town's culture, fueled by the Tobacco Road rivalry among North Carolina's four ACC teams: the North Carolina Tar Heels, the Duke Blue Devils, the NC State Wolfpack, and the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. The two largest sports venues in the town both house UNC teams. The Dean Smith Center is home to the men's basketball team, while Kenan Memorial Stadium is home to the football team. In addition, Chapel Hill is also home to Carmichael Arena which formerly housed the UNC men's basketball team, and currently is home to the women's team, and to the new Dorrance Field, home to men's and women's soccer and lacrosse teams. Many walking/biking trails are in Chapel Hill. Some of these include Battle Branch Trail and Bolin Creek Trail. =Media= * WCHL: local AM radio station (1360AM, 97.9FM) providing talk radio, news, and local sports coverage as the flagship station of the Tar Heel Sports Network. * WUNC: local public radio station (91.5FM) located on the UNC campus. * WXYC: noncommercial student-run radio station (89.3FM) on the UNC campus.

The club was established in 1901 by a merger of Burton Swifts and Burton Wanderers, and played their last competitive season in 1910. In 1924 they merged with Burton All Saints continuing the lineage of the history of football in Burton, while at the same time legally ending the club. Between 1901 and 1907 the club were members of the Football League. History 1906‚Äì07. The club was formed in 1901 when Burton Swifts merged with Burton Wanderers. Swifts had played in the Football League since 1892, whilst Wanderers had been Football League members between 1894 and 1897 but were now members of the Midland League. It was unusual for a smaller town such as Burton to host two Football League clubs so it was hoped the merger would see an upturn in fortunes for the United club. The new club took Swifts' place in the Second Division of the Football League and took over residence at their Peel Croft home. However, the new club failed to achieve success, and never finished above 10th place or made it past the first round of the FA Cup. In the 1904‚Äì05 and 1905‚Äì06 seasons the club finished in second last place, and in 1906‚Äì07 finished bottom.

The term comes from the treatment of the meat with large-grained rock salt, also called \\"corns\\" of salt. Sometimes, sugar and spices are also added to corned beef recipes. Corned beef is featured as an ingredient in many cuisines. Most recipes include nitrates, which convert the natural myoglobin in beef to nitrosomyoglobin, giving it a pink color. Nitrates and nitrites reduce the risk of dangerous botulism during curing by inhibiting the growth of Clostridium botulinum bacteria spores, but have been shown to be linked to increased cancer risk in mice. Beef cured without nitrates or nitrites has a gray color, and is sometimes called \\"New England corned beef\\". Corned beef was a popular meal throughout numerous wars, including World War I and World War II, during which fresh meat was rationed. It also remains popular worldwide as an ingredient in a variety of regional, national or foreign dishes, and as a common part in modern field rations of various armed forces across the world. History Although the exact beginnings of corned beef are unknown, it most likely came about when people began preserving meat through salt-curing. Evidence of its legacy is apparent in numerous cultures, including ancient Europe and the Middle East. The word corn derives from Old English and is used to describe any small, hard particles or grains. \\"A small hard particle, a grain, as of sand or salt.\\" In the case of corned beef, the word may refer to the coarse, granular salts used to cure the beef. The word \\"corned\\" may also refer to the corns of potassium nitrate, also known as saltpeter, which were formerly used to preserve the meat. =19th-century Atlantic trade= Libby, McNeill & Libby Corned Beef, 1910 Although the practice of curing beef was found locally in many cultures, the industrial production of corned beef started in the British Industrial Revolution. Irish corned beef was used and traded extensively from the 17th century to the mid-19th century for British civilian consumption and as provisions for the British naval fleets and North American armies due to its nonperishable nature. The product was also traded to the French for use in Caribbean sugar plantations as sustenance for the colonists and the slave laborers. The 17th-century British industrial processes for corned beef did not distinguish between different cuts of beef beyond the tough and undesirable parts such as the beef necks and shanks. Rather, the grading was done by the weight of the cattle into \\"small beef\\", \\"cargo beef\\", and \\"best mess beef\\", the former being the worst and the latter the best. Much of the undesirable portions and lower grades were traded to the French, while better parts were saved for British consumption or shipped to British colonies. A corned beef on rye bread sandwich served in an American restaurant Ireland produced a significant amount of the corned beef in the Atlantic trade from local cattle and salt imported from the Iberian Peninsula and southwestern France. Coastal cities, such as Dublin, Belfast, and Cork, created vast beef curing and packing industries, with Cork producing half of Ireland's annual beef exports in 1668. Although the production and trade of corned beef as a commodity was a source of great wealth for the colonial nations of Britain and France (which were participating in the Atlantic slave trade), in the colonies themselves, the product was looked upon with disdain due to its association with poverty and slavery. Increasing corned beef production to satisfy the rising populations of the industrialised areas of Great Britain and Atlantic trade worsened the effects of the Irish Famine (1740‚Äì1741) and the Great Famine of Ireland (1845-1849): Despite being a major producer of beef, most of the people of Ireland during this period consumed little of the meat produced, in either fresh or salted form, due to its prohibitive cost. This was because most of the farms and its produce were owned by wealthy Anglo-Irish who were absentee landlords and that most of the population were from families of poor tenant farmers, and that most of the corned beef was exported. The lack of beef or corned beef in the Irish diet is especially true in the north of Ireland and areas away from the major centres for corned beef production. However, individuals living in these production centres such as Cork did consume the product to a certain extent. The majority of Irish who resided in Ireland at the time mainly consumed dairy products and meats such as pork or salt pork, bacon and cabbage being a notable example of a traditional Irish meal. =20th century to present= Canned corned beef produced in Argentina for export to New Zealand, 1946 Corned beef became a less important commodity in 19th-century Atlantic trade, due in part to the abolition of slavery, but corned beef production and its canned form remained an important food source during the Second World War. Much of the canned corned beef came from Fray Bentos in Uruguay, with over 16 million cans exported in 1943. Even now, significant amounts of the global canned corned beef supply comes from South America. Today, around 80% of the global canned corned beef supply originates from Brazil. Cultural associations In North America, corned beef dishes are associated with traditional Irish cuisine. However, considerable debate remains about the association of corned beef with Ireland. Mark Kurlansky, in his book Salt, states that the Irish produced a salted beef around the Middle Ages that was the \\"forerunner of what today is known as Irish corned beef\\" and in the 17th century, the English named the Irish salted beef \\"corned beef\\". Before the wave of 19th-century Irish immigration to the United States, many of the ethnic Irish did not consume corned beef dishes as seen today. The popularity of corned beef compared to back bacon among the immigrant Irish may have been due to corned beef being considered a luxury product in their native land, while it was cheaply and readily available in America. The Jewish population produced similar salt-cured meat from beef brisket. Irish immigrants often purchased it as corned beef from Jewish butchers. This exchange was an example of the close interactions in everyday life of people from these two cultures in the United States' main 19th- and 20th-century immigrant port of entry, New York City. Canned corned beef has long been one of the standard meals included in military field ration packs around the world, due to its simplicity and instant preparation in such rations. One example is the American Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) pack. Astronaut John Young snuck a contraband corned beef sandwich on board Gemini 3, hiding it in a pocket of his spacesuit. Regions =North America= Minnesota In the United States and Canada, corned beef typically comes in two forms: a cut of beef (usually brisket, but sometimes round or silverside) cured or pickled in a seasoned brine; or cooked and canned. Corned beef is often purchased ready to eat in delicatessens. It is the key ingredient in the grilled Reuben sandwich, consisting of corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Thousand Island or Russian dressing on rye bread. Smoking corned beef, typically with a generally similar spice mix, produces smoked meat (or \\"smoked beef\\") such as pastrami or Montreal-style smoked meat. Corned beef hash with potatoes is commonly served with eggs for breakfast. In both the United States and Canada, corned beef is sold in cans in minced form. It is also sold this way in Puerto Rico and Uruguay. Newfoundland and Labrador Corned beef is known specifically as \\"salt beef\\" in Newfoundland and Labrador, and is sold in buckets with brine to preserve the beef. It is a staple product culturally in Newfoundland and Labrador, providing a source of meat throughout their long winters. It is still commonly eaten in Newfoundland and Labrador, most often associated with the local Jiggs dinner meal. It has as of recent years been used in different meals locally, such as a Jiggs Dinner poutine dish. Saint Patrick's Day In the United States, consumption of corned beef is often associated with Saint Patrick's Day. Corned beef is not considered an Irish national dish, and the connection with Saint Patrick's Day specifically originates as part of Irish-American culture, and is often part of their celebrations in North America. Corned beef was used as a substitute for bacon by Irish immigrants in the late 19th century. Corned beef and cabbage is the Irish-American variant of the Irish dish of bacon and cabbage. A similar dish is the New England boiled dinner, consisting of corned beef, cabbage, and root vegetables such as carrots, turnips, and potatoes, which is popular in New England and another similar dish, Jiggs dinner, is popular in parts of Atlantic Canada. =United Kingdom= In the UK, ‚Äòcorned beef‚Äô refers to minced and canned salt beef. Unminced corned beef is referred to as salt beef. =Ireland= Corned beef dinner, with potatoes and cabbage, Ireland The appearance of corned beef in Irish cuisine dates to the 12th century in the poem Aislinge Meic Con Glinne or The Vision of MacConglinne. Within the text, it is described as a delicacy a king uses to purge himself of the \\"demon of gluttony\\". Cattle, valued as a bartering tool, were only eaten when no longer able to provide milk or to work. The corned beef as described in this text was a rare and valued dish, given the value and position of cattle within the culture, as well as the expense of salt, and was unrelated to the corned beef eaten today. = Caribbean = Multiple Caribbean nations have their own varied versions of canned corned beef as a dish, common in Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Barbados, and elsewhere.https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/246392/puerto-rican-canned-corned- beef-stew/ With cans being less perishable, it's an effective food to import to tropical islands that will keep, despite the heat and humidity. Corned beef is a cheap, quick, and familiar low-effort comfort food that might be prepared for any meal of the day. As with other cuisines, cooks often improvise to add extra flavouring components (usually what they have around or left over) to their corned beef, including: onions, garlic, ketchup, black pepper, salt, oil (or other fat), corn, potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage, carrots, beans, hot and/or bell peppers, etc. It's very often served with a starch, such as rice, roti, bread, or potatoes. Due to its simplicity, many Caribbean children grow up thinking fondly of this dish. = Israel = In Israel, a canned corned beef called Loof was the traditional field ration of the Israel Defense Forces until the product's discontinuation in 2011. The name Loof derives from \\"a colloquially corrupt short form of 'meatloaf.'\\" Loof was developed by the IDF in the late 1940s as a kosher form of bully beef, while similar canned meats had earlier been an important component of relief packages sent to Europe and Palestine by Jewish organizations such as Hadassah. = New Zealand = In New Zealand, both the canned and fresh varieties are referred to as corned beef; fresh corned beef is almost always made with silverside; 'silverside' and 'corned beef' are often used interchangeably. Canned corned beef is especially popular among New Zealand's Polynesian community, as in Pacific island nations such as Western Samoa and Tonga. = Hong Kong = Corned beef has also become a common dish in Hong Kong cuisine, though it has been heavily adapted in style and preparation to fit local tastes. It is often served with other 'Western' fusion cuisine at cha chaan teng and other cheap restaurants catering to locals. Like most localized 'Western' food in East Asia, trade, imperialism, and war played roles in bringing and popularizing corned beef in Hong Kong. = Philippines = In the Philippines, corned beef is typically made from shredded beef or buffalo meat, and is almost exclusively sold in cans. It is boiled, shredded, canned, and sold in supermarkets and grocery stores for mass consumption. It is usually served fried, mixed with onions and garlic, with a side of Sinangag (garlic fried rice) also known as arroz cantones and arroz chino, and a fried egg. Along with other canned meats, canned corned beef is a popular breakfast staple in the Philippines. As such, meat processing companies such as CDO Foodsphere and San Miguel Food and Beverage all exist to cater to the high demand. Carne Norte (alternative spelling: karne norte) is another term that is used to describe Philippine corned beef. Literally translating to \\"Northern meat\\" in Spanish, the term refers to Americans, whom Filipinos referred then as norteamericanos, just like the rest of Spain's colonies, where there is a differentiation between what is norteamericano (Canadian, American, Mexicano) as there are between centroamericano (Nicaraguense, Costaricense et al.) and sudamericano (Colombiano, Equatoriano, Paraguayo, et al.). The colonial mindset distinction then of what was norteamericano was countries north of the Viceroy's Road  Camino de Virreyes, the route used to transport goods from the Manila Galleon landing in the port of Acapulco overland for Havana via the port of Veracruz (and not the Rio Grande river in Texas today), thus centroamericano meant the other Spanish possessions south of Mexico city. Corned beef, especially the Libby's brand initially gained fame during the American commonwealth period (1901‚Äì1941), where only the very rich could afford such tins; they were advertised serving the corned beef cold and straight-from-the-can on to a bed of rice, or as patties in between bread. During the dark days of World War II (1942‚Äì1945), American soldiers brought for themselves, and airdropped from the skies the same corned beef; it was a life-or-death commodity since the Japanese Imperial Army forcibly controlled all food in an effort to subvert any resistance against them. After the war (1946 to present), corned beef gained far more popularity. It remains a staple in balikbayan boxes and Filipino breakfast tables. The ordinary Filipino can afford them, and many brands have sprung up, including Argentina Brand Corned Beef, wholly owned by and manufactured locally by Filipinos.

He has a green body, no visible nose, and lives in a trash can. Oscar's favorite thing is trash, as evidenced by the song \\"I Love Trash\\", with a running theme being his collection of seemingly useless items. Although the term \\"Grouch\\" aptly describes Oscar's misanthropic interaction with the other characters, it also refers to his species. The character was originally performed by Caroll Spinney from the show's first episode until his official retirement in 2018. Since 2015, Eric Jacobson has been the understudy for the character, and has taken on the full voice role since Spinney's last time puppeteering him. Origins The original orange version of Oscar from Season 1 (1969‚Äì1970) Initially, the puppet characters on Sesame Street did not actually appear on Sesame Street itself, but were relegated to the intermediary segments. Muppets creator Jim Henson wanted them to be integrated into the series, suggesting a giant bird and creature living in the neighborhood's trash can. The character was developed by Sesame Street head writer Jon Stone and Henson, based on the personality of a ‚Äúmagnificently rude‚Äù restaurant owner. Puppeteer Caroll Spinney found inspiration for the voice in the driver of a New York City taxi he took to the studio. His first line was \\"Where to Mac?\\". Henson credits the character's name to the owner and namesake of Oscar's Salt of the Sea. According to Henson's biography Henson and Jon Stone frequented Oscar's Salt of the Sea. Henson's office was on East 67th Street just around the corner from Oscar's Salt of the Sea on Third Avenue. In the early 1960s, Henson and Stone often had lunch there and observed that the owner Oscar Karp dressed in black, looked unkempt, and had a gruff disposition. The Oscar Muppet remained orange for the first season of Sesame Street and then changed to green, which became his permanent color. This was explained within the show by a visit to Swamp Mushy Muddy. According to Sesame Streets Robert W. Morrow, Oscar was created to indirectly demonstrate racial and ethnic diversity. Since his manners and tastes were different from those of the other characters, his creators hoped to address social issues by using his differences as a metaphor for racial and ethnic differences. Some viewers, however, saw Oscar as a \\"surrogate for poor, urban Americans\\" during the show's early seasons. In the early Sesame Street development there was criticism that Oscar represented residents of inner city who had grown to accept injustice when they should not have done so, and there were observers who perceived Oscar to be a negative impression of African- Americans even though the Sesame Workshop did not intend for him to represent black people. Joan Ganz Cooney was confused by this viewpoint when journalist Linda Francke informed her of its existence. Performing Oscar During the first season of Sesame Street, the street set was arranged in such a way that Spinney, who was right-handed, was forced to operate Oscar's head with his left hand. After the set was redesigned, Spinney was able to switch hands. In scenes where Big Bird and Oscar (both performed by Caroll Spinney) interact in a scene together, the situation has varied depending on the number of lines one or the other is given. When Spinney performed Big Bird, a second puppeteer operated Oscar to Spinney's voice or vocal track; however, occasionally, Matt Vogel instead operated the Big Bird puppet to a vocal track by Spinney, while he performed Oscar. The puppeteers have included Jerry Nelson and Jim Martin. In 2015, due to being diagnosed with dystonia, Spinney no longer puppeteered Oscar full-time on the show. Eric Jacobson became Spinney's understudy for Oscar; sometimes lip-syncing to a prerecorded vocal track by Spinney, and other times doing the voice himself. Jacobson started voicing Oscar for new material in Season 48 after Spinney's semi-retirement. On October 17, 2018, Spinney announced his full retirement from the character beginning the very same week as he planned to finish his final recordings on the following day. His final performance as Oscar the Grouch (and Big Bird) aired the following year for the series' landmark 50th anniversary. Attributes Oscar can also become mobile with the help of his friend Bruno the Trashman, who carries Oscar around in his trash can. Bruno is a full-body costume which allows Oscar's puppeteer to manipulate Oscar while remaining hidden by the Bruno costume. (While Bruno was seen fairly regularly in Sesame Street's early days, he hasn't appeared on the show in over a decade.) Also, as seen in the Elmo's World episode \\"Dance\\", Oscar's legs can protrude from the bottom of his trash can to allow him to walk around. Similarly, in Christmas Eve on Sesame Street (1978), Oscar is seen ice skating. For several seasons, Oscar was frequently shown with his friend and pet Slimey, an orange worm. On occasional episodes he has mentioned leaving Sesame Street to attend \\"the annual Grouch convention in Syracuse, New York\\". Oscar openly admits that he does not like anything or anybody that is nice, except young human children (the only people that he can actually act nice to without facing ridicule from his fellow Grouches) as well as older fans of the show. However, the only person he has ever liked on- camera was Maria, which he would never admit. He once inadvertently complimented a dance that his followers, The Grouchketeers, had performed for him. Oscar has shown rare acts of kindness such as trying to replace Ernie's rubber duckie when Ernie had lost it. He also went out to find the missing Big Bird in \\"Christmas Eve on Sesame Street\\". He and his girlfriend Grundgetta also love each other, though their relationship is (understandably) somewhat rocky (though he does show he cares for her). As stated above, he is usually very nice to children especially when making public appearances with Spinney. According to a recent episode, Oscar hates \\"Pox News\\" (a parody of Fox News) but his mother likes it. In an unused sketch referencing the Hebrew version of Sesame Street, Oscar finds out that he has a cousin and apart from language, not much else is different. In a play on the name of the Ashkenazy tribe of Jews, Oscar explains to Maria (the only Human he can really tolerate on an ongoing basis) that his cousin's name is Oswald and goes by Ashcan Ozzie. The character's actual name is Moishe Oofnik, lives in his car and wouldn't move into a recycling bin for many years. Although filmed, the sequence was deleted after children's test audiences didn't get the pun and their parents treated it as heavily Anti-Semitic. In Oscar's trash can While appearing to be the size of a normal trash can on the outside, Oscar's trash can is actually bigger on the inside than the exterior would suggest, notably revealed in the film The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. Oscar has noted through the years that it boasts such amenities as a farm, swimming pool, ice rink, bowling alley, and piano. Oscar could occasionally be seen rotating while descending into his trash can, implying a spiral staircase. Other items include Slimey, Oscar's pet worm (who has a baby sister named Sloppy); Fluffy, Oscar's pet elephant; Oscar's shoes; and a dimension gate to Grouchland USA, Oscar's hometown. As stated on multiple occasions, the trash can also has a back door. International While Oscar receives new names in international dubs, Sesame Street international co-productions have often created their own version of the character. In their second season, Germany's Sesamstrasse created an antagonistic character named Uli von B√∂defeld. While not a Grouch, he served the same role in plots as Oscar. When a fire destroyed the costume in 1988, a decade after he debuted, he and American segments of Oscar were both replaced by a Grouch named Rumpel. Caterpillar Gustav is the counterpoint to Slimey. Israeli Grouch, Moishe Oofnik, Oscar's cousin, is the only character to survive the first Rechov Sumsum, appearing in its current reboot, English/Hebrew series Shalom Sesame, and Israeli-Palestinian co-production Rechov Sumsum/Shara'a Simsim. Other Grouches include Bodoque on Mexico's Plaza S√©samo, Pancho Contreras on US Spanish version, Gugu on Brazil's Vila Sesamo, Kƒ±rpƒ±k on Turkey's Susam Sokaƒüƒ±, Ferr√£o on Portugal's Rua S√©samo, and Kewal Khadoosa on India's Galli Galli Sim Sim. Filipino adaptation Sesame! featured Kiko Matsing, basically a gorilla. Some Grouches differ from the mostly antagonistic mold. France's 1, Rue S√©same featured Mordicus, who, like Oscar, lives in a trash can, and is slightly cynical, but is also described as lively and enthusiastic, and participated in the neighborhood band. In Pakistan, he is named Akhtar and lives in a rusty oil barrel. Appearances in other media A hybrid of Oscar the Grouch, Ernie, and the Cookie Monster appears in The Goodies episode \\"The Goodies Rule ‚Äì O.K.?\\", where it attacked Tim Brooke- Taylor whilst in a bin, only for Tim to eat it. Oscar made what he called \\"a very brief cameo\\" in the 1981 Jim Henson movie The Great Muppet Caper. When Miss Piggy threw a truck driver (played by Peter Ustinov) into a pile of boxes and a pile of trash cans, Oscar emerged from his trash can and demanded \\"Hey, what's all the racket?\\" The driver asked him, \\"What are you doing here?\\" Oscar replied, \\"A very brief cameo.\\" The driver muttered, \\"Me, too.\\" Oscar also appeared in the Jim Henson holiday special, A Muppet Family Christmas, when the Sesame Street Gang comes to the Grizzly Farm House for the holidays, in the film he befriends Rizzo the Rat who asks the Grouch if he could stay in his trash can for the night. Oscar agreed saying that he never had a rat in his trash can before. Oscar could be seen among many villains in the South Park episode \\"Imagination Land III\\". Oscar appears in the episode \\"Fashion\\" of the IFC show Portlandia. Oscar was on an episode of Scrubs, imagined as the new chief of medicine. Oscar is one of numerous PBS personalities chasing after Homer Simpson for not being able to pay a pledge in a Simpsons season 11 episode, \\"Missionary: Impossible\\". Oscar crashes through the window of the church Homer is hiding in, and demands the money while Elmo, who was hiding in the trash can with him, tells Homer he knows where he lives. He also appears in \\"Trash of the Titans\\" in a The Simpsons season 9 episode. Oscar inspired an Apple Macintosh INIT written by Eric B. Shapiro and shown at the 1989 MacHack conference, featuring a singing animated Oscar that appeared from the trash can when the trash was emptied. The hack was so popular that some parents lost the entire contents of their hard disks to preschoolers wanting to see more of Oscar, prompting Shapiro to create a stand-alone application using the same animation and sounds. The software was discontinued after Children's Television Workshop sent Shapiro a cease and desist letter. The fumetti comic Twisted Toyfare Theater once featured Oscar in an issue in which he sings a variation of his \\"I Love Trash\\" song about Wesley Snipes' movies. In the end, Wesley Snipes (as Blade) decapitates him. Oscar appeared on seven episodes of the game show 1 vs. 100, which aired between January and February 2008. Beginning in 2008, Oscar became the mascot for Waste Reduction Week in Canada, an environmental campaign. In an episode of The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, an Oscar-like character emerges from a dustbin and instructs the viewer that it's \\"not cool\\" to play with scythes (in response to Irwin's stealing and misuse of Grim's scythe) and instructs viewers to \\"tell an adult immediately\\" if they find one. In the Night at the Museum sequel Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, Oscar has an appearance with Darth Vader, trying to become part of Kahmunrah's team ‚Äî only to be discovered that he is not evil, just \\"vaguely grouchy\\". The Oscar puppet that was used in filming is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. On May 29, 2009, Oscar the Grouch appeared in an ABC television special on economics called Un-broke: What You Need To Know About Money. He appeared showing the viewers what investing stocks means. It's shown that he has investment filings with Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and Washington Mutual even though they are bankrupt companies, but he then says that they're not really his filings. The press kit for the special reveals that Oscar was popular with the crew for the special even during filming. On October 11, 2009, Oscar appeared on the CBC Radio One show Q, hosted by Jian Ghomeshi. Beyond talking about his time on Sesame Street, his love for trash and recycling, Oscar revealed that his father is actually from Saint David, New Brunswick and his mother grew up in Nova Scotia, thus making him of Canadian descent. He further went on to suggest that he had cheated on Grundgetta, his long-time girlfriend. On November 12, 2009, Oscar appeared on CNN to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Sesame Street. In an interview with Anderson Cooper, Oscar reveals that he would still be orange if he bathed; his green exterior is apparently moss. On an episode of Cake Boss, Buddy and his bakers visited Sesame Street, and Danny could be seen inside Oscar's Trash Can. He tries his best Oscar impression by saying \\"I live in the trash.\\" Oscar can also be seen at the end when Buddy reveals his cake, but then goes back in his trash can, ostensibly to get away from the laughing and cheering. Oscar also made appearances in episodes of the Cartoon Network show MAD. On a Q TV interview promoting the benefits of being \\"[Eco-]Green\\" Oscar suggests that he is actually Canadian. He later mentions that his favorite dessert is spinach sardine chocolate fudge sundaes. His second favorite dessert is mashed bananas with ice cubes and cold beef gravy, and in Season 12 he owns a car called \\"The Sloppy Jalopy\\". The October 12, 2019 episode of season 45 of Saturday Night Live hosted by David Harbour included a sketch presenting the origin story of Oscar the Grouch in a Joker spoof.

She was a daughter of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. After the death of Edward IV of England in 1483 it was claimed by his brother Richard, the future Richard III, that she had had a legal precontract of marriage to Edward, which invalidated the king's later marriage to Elizabeth Woodville. According to Richard, this meant that he, rather than Edward's sons, was the true heir to the throne. Richard took the crown and imprisoned Edward's sons, who subsequently disappeared. After the overthrow and death of Richard at the hands of Henry Tudor, the precontract alleged by Richard was presented as a fiction to justify Richard's usurpation of power and to cover his murder of the princes. Some historians have agreed with this view. Supporters of Richard, however, have argued that the precontract was real and that it legitimised his accession to the throne.Muriel Smith, \\"Reflections on Lady Eleanor\\", The Ricardian, September 1998, no 142 Known life In 1449, 13-year-old Eleanor married Sir Thomas Butler (or Boteler), son of Ralph Butler, Lord Sudeley. Thomas died at an unknown date before Edward IV of England's overthrow of the House of Lancaster on 4 March 1461. Her father-in-law Lord Sudeley took back one of the two manors he had settled on her and her husband when they married, even though he did not have a license for the transfer. Edward IV seized both properties after he became king. Eleanor died in June 1468. She was buried on 30 June in Norwich. Allegations Edward IV, alleged to have precontracted marriage to Eleanor Talbot After King Edward's death in 1483, his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was appointed protector to the as-yet-uncrowned king Edward V. Richard placed Edward and his younger brother in the Tower of London. He then proclaimed that they were illegitimate. According to the French chronicler Philippe de Commines he acted with the support of Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells. Stillington had been briefly imprisoned and fined for speaking out against Edward IV in 1478. Commines later wrote, > The bishop discovered to the Duke of Gloucester that his brother king Edward > had been formerly in love with a beautiful young lady and had promised her > marriage upon condition that he might lie with her; the lady consented, and, > as the bishop affirmed, he married them when nobody was present but they two > and himself. His fortune depending on the court, he did not discover it, and > persuaded the lady likewise to conceal it, which she did, and the matter > remained a secret.Philipe de Commines, '‚ÄôThe memoirs of Philip de Commines, > lord of Argenton'‚Äô, Volume 1, H.G. Bohn, 1855, pp.396‚Äì7 Richard then persuaded Parliament to pass an act, Titulus Regius, which debarred Edward V from the throne and proclaimed himself as King Richard III. At a meeting held on 23 January 1484 the former king's marriage was declared illegal. The document states: > And howe also, that at the tyme of contract of the same pretensed Mariage, > and bifore and longe tyme after, the seid King Edward was and stode maryed > and trouth plight to oone Dame Elianor Butteler, Doughter of the old Earl of > Shrewesbury, with whom the same King Edward had made a precontracte of > Matrimonie, longe tyyme bifore he made the said pretensed Mariage with the > said Elizabeth Grey, in maner and fourme abovesaid. Opponents of Richard declared that the precontract was fiction. Richard's leading enemy, Henry Tudor, allied himself with Elizabeth Woodville, promising to re-legitimise her children if Richard was overthrown. After Henry's army defeated and killed Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485, he came to the throne as Henry VII. He ordered the copy of Titulus Regius in parliamentary records to be destroyed, along with all others (one copy was later found to have survived). Stillington later joined the rebellion of Lambert Simnel against Henry in 1487. He was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower until his death in 1491. Possible issue It was suggested that Eleanor had given birth to a child, possibly fathered by King Edward IV, shortly before her death.Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy (1989), p. 141 Views of Historians Because Commines does not name the \\"beautiful young lady\\", and the official copy of Titulus Regius in parliament had been destroyed, Tudor historians confused Talbot with Edward's long-standing mistress Elizabeth Lucy (also known as Elizabeth Wayte). Elizabeth Lucy was probably the mother of Edward IV's bastard son, Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle. Thomas More in his life of Richard III states that Lucy was interrogated at the time of Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, because Edward's mother was strongly opposed to the marriage and had suggested that Edward was pre-contracted to Lucy. But Lucy denied that any contract had been made. He says that Richard revived the claim after Edward's death.J.R. Lumby (ed), More's History of king Richard III, Cambridge University Press, 1883, pp.61‚Äì2, 70 This threw further doubt on the case, but later historians correctly identified her. George Buck, who found the only surviving copy of Titulus Regius, was the first to identify Eleanor Talbot as the woman in question. Buck, a defender of Richard, accepted the validity of the precontract. His view has been followed by many defenders of Richard since, including Horace WalpoleThe Works of Horatio Walpole, Earl of Orford, G. G. and J. Robinson, 1798, p.113. and Clements Markham.Clements R. Markham, Richard III: his life & character, reviewed in the light of recent research, London: Smith and Elder, 1906, pp.94‚Äì101. Later Ricardians have also either accepted it as fact, or argued that Richard sincerely believed it to be true. It is also commonly argued by Ricardians that Stillington was imprisoned by Edward IV in 1478 because he incautiously spoke of the precontract to George, Duke of Clarence.John Ashdown-Hill, Eleanor, the Secret Queen: The Woman Who Put Richard III on the Throne, The History Press, 2009. Other historians have been more sceptical. John A. Wagner states that \\"most modern historians believe the precontract to be a fabrication devised to give Richard III's usurpation a veneer of legitimacy. The betrothal cannot be documented beyond the account rehearsed in Titulus Regius, and Richard never attempted to have the precontract authenticated by a church court, the proper venue for such a case\\".John A. Wagner, \\"Butler precontract (1483)\\", Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses, ABC-CLIO, 2001, pp.42‚Äì3. Anne Crawford takes the view that any actual precontract with Eleanor Talbot is unlikely. If it had occurred before her marriage to Thomas Butler it would have been invalidated by the marriage. She suggests that the story may have originated with discussions between Edward's father Richard, Duke of York, and Eleanor's father John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, of a possible marriage, while both men were serving in France. But even that \\"seems hardly likely\\".Anne Crawford, The Yorkists: The History of a Dynasty, \\"appeandix II, Edward IV's Possible Pre-Contract of Marriage\\", pp.179‚Äì80. Any valid precontract would most likely have been made in the early phase of Edward's reign, but the fact that Eleanor did not come forward when Edward married his queen militates against it. She also considers it odd that Eleanor's family did not support Richard's claims about the precontract. Since Edward was \\"not stupid enough\\" to have been unaware that any precontact would threaten his children's claim to the throne, if it had existed he could easily have applied to the Pope to free himself of it, which would have been the action of \\"any prudent king and his advisors\\". Michael Alexander argues that a precontract of marriage to Eleanor Talbot would not have affected the legitimacy of Edward's sons, since they were born after she died, her death negating any marriage.Michael Van Cleave Alexander, The First of the Tudors: A Study of Henry VII and His Reign, Taylor & Francis, 1981, p.9. However, according to Helmholz (1986),R.H. Helmholz, 'The sons of Edward IV: a canonical assessment of the claim that they were illegitimate', in Richard III: Loyalty, Lordship and Law, ed P.W. Hammond (London, 1986, repr. 2000). canon law in this situation would not mitigate the illegitimacy of Edward's sons as, if the pre-contract existed, it would have meant that adultery had taken place on the part of Edward with Elizabeth. As such the illegitimacy could not be overcome by the death of Eleanor before the birth of Elizabeth's sons, even if Edward and Elizabeth married 'again' after Eleanor's death. Their position would therefore have been similar to that of the Beaufort descendants of Katherine Swynford and John of Gaunt, later legitimised by both King Richard II of England and Pope Boniface IX.Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)- Legitimation by William Henry Windsor Fanning Even if there was no formal precontract it is possible that Eleanor Talbot's name was used because she was known to have been one of the king's lovers. According to Thomas More, Edward had three \\"concubines\\" to whom he referred as the \\"merriest\\", the \\"wiliest\\" and \\"the holiest harlot in the realm\\" (who was always in church when she wasn't in bed with the king).The \\"king would say that he had three concubines who in three diverse properties diversely excelled: one the merriest, another the wiliest, the third the holiest harlot in the realm, as one whom no man could get out of the church lightly but it were to his bed.\\" Keith Dockray (ed), Edward IV: a sourcebook, Sutton, 1999, p.15. More names the \\"merriest\\" as Jane Shore, but does not name the others because they were of higher social status (\\"somewhat greater personages\\"). It has been speculated that Elizabeth Lucy and Eleanor Talbot were the other two.Linda Simon, Of virtue rare: Margaret Beaufort, matriarch of the House of Tudor, Houghton Mifflin, 1982, p.58.Chris Given Wilson, Alice Curteis, The Royal Bastards of Medieval England, Routledge, 1984, p. 12. Her loss of property after the death of her husband may have initiated the affair. Michael Hicks suggests that King Edward was liable to give \\"benefits\\" in exchange for sex: \\"Three young widows, Eleanor Butler, Elizabeth Lucy and Elizabeth Wydeville [Woodville], may have bought concrete benefits from Edward IV with their sexual favours\\".Michael Hicks, English Political Culture in the Fifteenth Century, Routledge, New York, 2002, p.16 References Eleanor Talbot Category:Mistresses of English royalty Category:Daughters of British earls Category:1468 deaths Eleanor Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1436 births Category:15th-century English women Category:15th-century English people ","title":"Lady Eleanor Talbot"},{"id":"71861","text":"''''' (\\"royal title\\" in Latin) is a statute of the Parliament of England, issued in 1484, by which the title of King of England was given to Richard III. The act ratifies the declaration of the lords and the members of the House of Commons a year earlier that the marriage of Edward IV of England to Elizabeth Woodville had been invalid and so their children, including Edward, Richard and Elizabeth, were illegitimate and thus debarred from the throne. Richard III had been proclaimed the rightful king. Since the Lords and Commons had not been officially convened as a parliament, doubts had arisen as to its validity, so when Parliament convened it enacted the declaration as a law. Following the overthrow of Richard III, the Act was repealed, which had the effect of reinstating the legitimacy of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville's children. Contents Richard III promulgated the ' to legitimize his seizure of the throne. Society of Antiquaries of London. Edward's marriage was invalidated because Bishop Robert Stillington testified that the king had precontracted a marriage to Lady Eleanor Butler. > And how also, that at the time of contract of the same pretensed Marriage, > and before and long time after, the said King Edward was and stood married > and troth-plight to one Dame Eleanor Butler, Daughter of the old Earl of > Shrewsbury, with whom the same King Edward had made a precontract of > Matrimony, long time before he made the said pretensed Marriage with the > said Elizabeth [Woodville] Grey, in manner and form above-said. The document also claimed that Elizabeth Woodville and her mother had used witchcraft to get the king to marry her. Since Richard's brother George, Duke of Clarence, had been executed and attainted, his descendants forfeited all rights to the throne, leaving Richard the true heir. For good measure, the document also hinted that George and Edward were themselves illegitimate and stated Richard, \\"born within this land\\" was the \\"undoubted son and heir of Richard, late Duke of York\\".John A. Wagner, \\"Titulus Regius\\", Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses, ABC-CLIO, 2001, pp.268‚Äì70. Edward's reign was also criticised, he was said to have led by \\"sensuality and concupiscence\\" and delighted in \\"adulation and flattery\\" and to have been easily influenced by \\"persons insolent, vicious and of inordinate avarice\\", a reference to the Woodville family. In contrast, Richard was said to have been a man distinguished by \\"great wit, prudence, justice, princely courage, and memorable and laudable acts in diverse battles.\\" Repeal After Richard was overthrown, the Act was repealed by the first parliament of the new king, Henry VII. The repeal was important because the new King and his supporters viewed Richard III's rule as a usurpation and also because Henry VII's prospective wife, Elizabeth of York, whom he had pledged to marry if he gained the throne, was the eldest daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville and the Act had made her illegitimate as well. Henry also ordered his subjects to destroy all copies of it and all related documents without reading them. His orders were carried out so well that only one copy of the law has ever been found. That copy was transcribed by a monastic chronicler into the Croyland Chronicle, where it was discovered by Sir George Buck more than a century later during the reign of James I. The Repealing Act was passed in the first Parliament of Henry VII, stating that the original Titulus Regius was > void, adnulled, repelled, irrite [invalidated], and of noe force ne effecte and that the original be destroyed, and that any copies should be either destroyed or returned to Parliament on pain of fine and imprisonment. A law report from his reign stated: > ...that the said Bill, Act and Record, be annulled and utterly destroyed, > and that it be ordained by the same Authority, that the same Act and Record > be taken out of the Roll of Parliament, and be cancelled and brent > ['burned'], and be put in perpetual oblivion.Year Book 1 Henry VII, Hil., > plea 1 Henry almost succeeded in suppressing the Titulus Regius.Bryce, Tracy. \\"Titulus Regius: The Title of the King\\" , Richard III Society of Canada, accessed 31 October 2014 The 100-year gap during which ' was censored coincided with the ruling period of the Tudor dynasty. It was known that Richard had claimed that a marriage pre-contract invalidated Edward's sons' right to the throne, but it was not known who Edward's supposed \\"real\\" wife was. Thomas More assumed that the Act referred to Edward's longtime mistress, Elizabeth Lucy, a view that was repeated until Buck discovered the original document. Edward IV's first son, though Titulus Regius annulled his reign, is still counted as Edward V to emphasize that Richard III was an usurper. Thus, Henry VII's grandson was numbered Edward VI.

Biography =Early life= Marija Gimbutas was born as Marija Birutƒó Alseikaitƒó to Veronika Janulaitytƒó-Alseikienƒó and Danielius Alseika in Vilnius, the capital of Republic of Central Lithuania; her parents were members of the Lithuanian intelligentsia. Her mother received a doctorate in ophthalmology at the University of Berlin in 1908 and became the first female physician in Lithuania, while her father received his medical degree from the University of Tartu in 1910. After Lithuania regained independence in 1918, Gimbutas's parents founded the first Lithuanian hospital in the capital. During this period, her father also served as the publisher of the newspaper Vilniaus ≈Ωodis and the cultural magazine Vilniaus ≈†viesa and was an outspoken proponent of Lithuanian independence during the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War.. Gimbutas's parents were connoisseurs of traditional Lithuanian folk arts and frequently invited contemporary musicians, writers, and authors to their home, including Vyd≈´nas, Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, and Jonas Basanaviƒçius.. With regard to her strong cultural upbringing, Gimbutas said: > I had the opportunity to get acquainted with writers and artists such as > Vyd≈´nas, Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, even Basanaviƒçius, who was taken care of by my > parents. When I was four or five years old, I would sit in Basanaviƒçius's > easy chair and I would feel fine. And later, throughout my entire life, > Basanaviƒçius's collected folklore remained extraordinarily important for me. In 1931, Gimbutas settled with her parents in Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania, where she continued her studies. After her parents separated that year, she lived with her mother and brother, Vytautas, in Kaunas. Five years later, her father died suddenly. At her father's deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: \\"All of a sudden I had to think what I shall be, what I shall do with my life. I had been so reckless in sports‚Äîswimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding. I changed completely and began to read.\\". =Emigration and life abroad= In 1941, she married architect Jurgis Gimbutas. During the Second World War, Gimbutas lived under the Soviet occupation (1940‚Äì41) and then the German occupation (1941‚Äì43).. Gimbutas' first daughter, Danutƒó, was born in June 1942. Early in 1944 the young Gimbutas family, in the face of an advancing Soviet army, fled the country to areas controlled by Nazi Germany, first to Vienna and then to Innsbruck and Bavaria.. In her reflection of this turbulent period, Gimbutas remarked, \\"Life just twisted me like a little plant, but my work was continuous in one direction.\\". While holding a postdoctoral fellowship at T√ºbingen the following year, Gimbutas gave birth to her second daughter, ≈Ωivilƒó. In the 1950s, the Gimbutas family left Germany and relocated to the United States, where Gimbutas had a successful academic career... Her third daughter, Rasa Julija, was born in 1954 in Boston. Gimbutas died in Los Angeles in 1994, at age 73. Soon afterwards, she was interred in Kaunas's Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery. Career = Education and academic appointments = From 1936, Gimbutas participated in ethnographic expeditions to record traditional folklore and studied Lithuanian beliefs and rituals of death. She graduated with honors from Au≈°ra Gymnasium in Kaunas in 1938 and enrolled in the Vytautas Magnus University the same year, where she studied linguistics in the Department of Philology. She then attended the University of Vilnius to pursue graduate studies in archaeology (under Jonas Puzinas), linguistics, ethnology, folklore and literature. In 1942 she completed her master's thesis, \\"Modes of Burial in Lithuania in the Iron Age\\", with honors. She received her Master of Arts degree from the University of Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1942. In 1946, Gimbutas received a doctorate in archaeology, with minors in ethnology and history of religion, from University of T√ºbingen with her dissertation \\"Prehistoric Burial Rites in Lithuania\\" (\\"Die Bestattung in Litauen in der vorgeschichtlichen Zeit\\"), which was published later that year. She often said that she had the dissertation under one arm and her child under the other arm when she and her husband fled the city of Kaunas, Lithuania, in the face of an advancing Soviet army in 1944. From 1947 to 1949 she did postgraduate work at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Munich. After arriving in the United States in the 1950s, Gimbutas immediately went to work at Harvard University translating Eastern European archaeological texts. She then became a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology. In 1955 she was made a Fellow of Harvard's Peabody Museum. Gimbutas then taught at UCLA, where she became Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies in 1964 and Curator of Old World Archaeology in 1965. In 1993, Gimbutas received an honorary doctorate at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania. =Kurgan hypothesis= In 1956 Gimbutas introduced her Kurgan hypothesis, which combined archaeological study of the distinctive Kurgan burial mounds with linguistics to unravel some problems in the study of the Proto-Indo- European (PIE) speaking peoples, whom she dubbed the \\"Kurgans\\"; namely, to account for their origin and to trace their migrations into Europe. This hypothesis, and her method of bridging the disciplines, has had a significant impact on Indo-European studies. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Gimbutas earned a reputation as a world-class specialist on Bronze Age Europe, as well as on Lithuanian folk art and the prehistory of the Balts and Slavs, partly summed up in her definitive opus, Bronze Age Cultures of Central and Eastern Europe (1965). In her work she reinterpreted European prehistory in light of her backgrounds in linguistics, ethnology, and the history of religions, and challenged many traditional assumptions about the beginnings of European civilization. As a Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies at UCLA from 1963 to 1989, Gimbutas directed major excavations of Neolithic sites in southeastern Europe between 1967 and 1980, including Anzabegovo, near ≈†tip, Republic of Macedonia, and Sitagroi and Achilleion in Thessaly (Greece). Digging through layers of earth representing a period of time before contemporary estimates for Neolithic habitation in Europe ‚Äì where other archaeologists would not have expected further finds ‚Äì she unearthed a great number of artifacts of daily life and of religious cults, which she researched and documented throughout her career. Three genetic studies in 2015 gave support to the Kurgan theory of Gimbutas regarding the Indo-European Urheimat. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Russian steppes, along with the Indo European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo European languages. =Late archaeology= Marija Gimbutas by Kerbstone 52, at the back of Newgrange, Co. Meath, Ireland, in September 1989 Gimbutas gained fame and notoriety in the English-speaking world with her last three English-language books: The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe (1974); The Language of the Goddess (1989), which inspired an exhibition in Wiesbaden, 1993‚Äì94; and the last of the three, The Civilization of the Goddess (1991), which, based on her documented archaeological findings, presented an overview of her conclusions about Neolithic cultures across Europe: housing patterns, social structure, art, religion, and the nature of literacy. The Civilization of the Goddess articulated what Gimbutas saw as the differences between the Old European system, which she considered goddess- and woman-centered (gynocentric), and the Bronze Age Indo-European patriarchal (\\"androcratic\\") culture which supplanted it. According to her interpretations, gynocentric (or matristic) societies were peaceful, honored women, and espoused economic equality. The androcratic, or male-dominated, Kurgan peoples, on the other hand, invaded Europe and imposed upon its natives the hierarchical rule of male warriors. =Influence= In 2003, filmmaker Donna Read and neopagan author and activist Starhawk released a collaborative documentary film about the life and work of Gimbutas, Signs Out of Time. The film produced under the label Belili Productions examines \\"her theories, her critics, and her influence on scholars, feminists and social thinkers.\\" Gimbutas's work, along with that of her colleague, mythologist Joseph Campbell, is housed in the OPUS Archives and Research Center on the campus of the Pacifica Graduate Institute in Carpinteria, California. The library includes Gimbutas's extensive collection on the topics of archaeology, mythology, folklore, art and linguistics. The Gimbutas Archives house over 12,000 images personally taken by Gimbutas of sacred figures, as well as research files on Neolithic cultures of Old Europe. Assessment Marija Gimbutienƒó commemorative plaque in Kaunas, Mickeviƒçius Street =Praise= Joseph Campbell and Ashley Montagu\\"According to anthropologist Ashley Montagu, \\"Marija Gimbutas has given us a veritable Rosetta Stone of the greatest heuristic value for future work in the hermeneutics of archaeology and anthropology.\\" Peter Steinfels (1990) Idyllic Theory Of Goddesses Creates Storm. NY Times, February 13, 1990 each compared the importance of Marija Gimbutas's output to the historical importance of the Rosetta Stone in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. Campbell provided a foreword to a new edition of Gimbutas's The Language of the Goddess (1989) before he died, and often said how profoundly he regretted that her research on the Neolithic cultures of Europe had not been available when he was writing The Masks of God. The ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak argued in 2011 that a \\"backlash\\" against Gimbutas's work had been orchestrated, starting in the last years of her life and following her death.Spretnak C., (2011), in Marler J. and Haarmann H., (eds.), \\"Anatomy of a Backlash: Concerning the Work of Marija Gimbutas\\" , Journal of Archaeomythology, 7: 1‚Äì27, ISSN 2162-6871 =Reception= Mainstream archaeology dismissed Gimbutas's later works.Paul Kiparsky, \\"New perspectives in historical linguistics\\", To appear in Claire Bowern (ed.)Handbook of Historical Linguistics. Anthropologist Bernard Wailes (1934‚Äì2012) of the University of Pennsylvania commented to The New York Times that most of Gimbutas's peersThe New York Times book of science literacy: what everyone needs to know from Newton to the knuckleball, page 85, Richard Flaste, 1992 believe her to be \\"immensely knowledgeable but not very good in critical analysis. ... She amasses all the data and then leaps from it to conclusions without any intervening argument.\\" He said that most archaeologists consider her to be an eccentric. David W. Anthony has praised Gimbutas's insights regarding the Indo-European Urheimat, but also disputed Gimbutas's assertion that there was a widespread peaceful society before the Kurgan incursion, noting that Europe had hillforts and weapons, and presumably warfare, long before the Kurgan. A standard textbook of European prehistory corroborates this point, stating that warfare existed in neolithic Europe and that adult males were given preferential treatment in burial rites.S. Milisauskas, European prehistory (Springer, 2002), p.82, 386, etc. See also Colin Renfrew, ed., The Megalithic Monuments of Western Europe: the latest evidence (London : Thames and Hudson, 1983). Peter Ucko and Andrew Fleming were two early critics of the \\"Goddess\\" theory, with which Gimbutas later came to be associated. Ucko, in his 1968 monograph Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt warned against unwarranted inferences about the meanings of statues. He notes, for example, that early Egyptian figurines of women holding their breasts had been taken as \\"obviously\\" significant of maternity or fertility, but the Pyramid Texts revealed that in Egypt this was the female gesture of grief.P. Ucko, Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt and neolithic Crete with comparative material from the prehistoric Near East and mainland Greece (London, A. Szmidla, 1968). Fleming, in his 1969 paper \\"The Myth of the Mother Goddess\\", questioned the practice of identifying neolithic figures as female when they weren't clearly distinguished as male and took issue with other aspects of the \\"Goddess\\" interpretation of Neolithic stone carvings and burial practices.A. Fleming (1969), \\"The Myth of the Mother Goddess\\" , World Archaeology 1(2), 247‚Äì261. Cynthia Eller also discusses the place of Gimbutas in inoculating the idea into feminism in her 2000 book The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory. The 2009 book Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism by Cathy Gere examines the political influence on archaeology more generally. Through the example of Knossos on the island of Crete, which had been represented as the paradigm of a pacifist, matriarchal and sexually free society, Gere claims that archaeology can easily slip into reflecting what people want to see, rather than teaching people about an unfamiliar past.Cathy Gere (2009), Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism, University of Chicago Press, pp. 4‚Äì16ff.See also Charlotte Allen, \\"The Scholars and the Goddess.\\", The Atlantic Monthly, January 1, 2001.

It closed at the end of the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year and gifted its endowment to Emerson College in Boston to create the Marlboro Institute of Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies at Emerson College. Students at Marlboro created an individualized course of study in collaboration with faculty members and participate in a self-governed community. Students pursued a self-designed, often inter-disciplinary thesis, the Plan of Concentration, based on their academic interests that culminated in a major body of scholarship. Students were able to use the college's organic farm, solar greenhouse, ecological reserve, and observatory. Weekly \\"town meetings\\" are held to vote for and change the college's bylaws. History Marlboro College was founded in 1946 by Walter Hendricks on Potash Hill in Marlboro, Vermont, and many of the first students were returning World War II veterans. The school's operation was initially financed using money received from the GI Bill, as well as loans from Brattleboro Savings and Loan. The campus incorporates the buildings of three old farms that once operated on the college site, along with more modern buildings. Marlboro has grown steadily since its inception, and 150 students currently attend, with an average enrollment of 250 students. The College, however, is kept \\"intentionally small.\\" In 1997 Marlboro College founded the Marlboro College Graduate School to apply the same educational principles of Marlboro College to advance the careers of working professionals. The Graduate School also offers an accelerated Master's track to undergraduates in select programs. While the Graduate School was initially located in nearby Brattleboro, it moved to the main college campus in Marlboro in April 2017. The Marlboro College campus has also been the summer home for more than 50 years to the Marlboro Music Festival. In 2018, Marlboro's small size and dwindling enrollment led it to begin exploring merging with another college or university. Discussions advanced with the University of Bridgeport but were called off in September 2019 as negotiations continued. Two months later, the college announced plans to merge with Emerson College in Boston. As per the agreement, Marlboro would give its endowment to Emerson where all Marlboro students will be admitted and tenure-track faculty will be able to choose to teach at Emerson. The deal was finalized by the Board of Trustees of Marlboro and Emerson Colleges on July 23, 2020. Marlboro closed its campus at the end of the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year, and the college ceased operations on August 15, 2020. Campus =Location= The Marlboro College campus was located on South Road in the town of Marlboro, Vermont, in the Green Mountains. Marlboro was just off Route 9, which runs east‚Äìwest across southern Vermont, ten miles from Brattleboro to the east with Wilmington and Bennington further to the west. Boston is two and a half hours to the east, Burlington is two and a half hours to the north, Hartford, CT is one and a half hours to the south, and New York City is four hours to the south. The closest major town is Brattleboro, and students frequently make the 20-minute drive along Route 9 to hang out there at night and on weekends. The similar but much larger Amherst‚ÄìNorthampton area of western Massachusetts, easily accessible via Interstate 91, is also a favorite hangout. =Facilities= The dining hall and Mather building at Marlboro College Marlboro's facilities were relatively small because of its enrollment numbers. Many of the buildings‚Äîincluding the main classroom building, the dining hall, the admissions building and the administration building‚Äîare converted farm buildings that predated the college. Students and faculty worked together to convert these historic buildings for use by the college. Through grants from federal, state and private entities, the college improved the energy-efficiency of the Dining Hall, Dalrymple classroom building, Mather administration building, and the Admissions building since 2008, as well as the student residences. In the summer of 2011, the half-circle driveway at the campus entrance was converted to green space and walking paths. Marlboro College Library The Serkin Performing Arts Center has a 125-seat auditorium, an electronic music lab, practice rooms with baby grand pianos and a 5,000-square foot dance studio. Whittemore Theater is another performing arts space which is used primarily by the Theater department. Attached to Whittemore theater is Drury Gallery, a gallery space often used by fine arts students to display their works, although students from other departments have also used the space to showcase their work. The Snyder Center for the Visual Arts, a $3.5-million dollar, 14,000-square-foot visual arts center that houses studios, classrooms, and gallery spaces, opened in May 2016. Academics Marlboro was 1 of only 3 national liberal arts colleges in which 100% of its classes have fewer than 20 students. Three quarters of Marlboro College alumni attend graduate school. =The Clear Writing Requirement= Freshman students usually took one or more classes designed to boost their writing skills to an acceptable undergraduate level. All freshmen were required to submit 20 pages (4,000 words) of nonfiction writing to the English Committee by the end of their second semester. If the committee decided that a student's writing skills needed more work, they recommended a class to help, and the student would prepare another portfolio, at least 10 pages of which must be new, at the end of the next semester for re-evaluation. In the event that a student failed the writing requirement for three consecutive semesters, the school will ask the student to leave with the caveat that they can return after receiving high marks from an English class at another school. However, virtually all students passed the writing requirement within two semesters. =The Plan of Concentration= Juniors and seniors focused on developing an individualized Plan of Concentration rather than on heavy coursework. \\"Plan\\" was a large, self- designed project often involving a combination of disciplines. Juniors and seniors focused on independent work and increasingly take tutorial classes where the student collaborates closely with a faculty member to design an individualized syllabus. For most students Plan culminates in a written thesis, although art and science students may demonstrate work through other projects. All Plans were required to include a written portion constituting at least 20 percent of the total plan work. In addition, all Plans were required to include an independent project prepared without direct faculty input, also constituting at least 20 percent of the total plan. Plans that consisted entirely of academic writing usually ranged from one hundred to two hundred pages, double-spaced. The results of this work were defended in an oral examination before two Marlboro professors, and one outside evaluator who has expertise in the student's field of study but was not connected with the college. The presence of the outside evaluator was meant to ensure that the grading process is fair and objective. The final plan was then put on permanent file as a reference work in the college library. =Academic honors= Loren Pope, original author of the Colleges that Change Lives college guide and former education editor for The New York Times, writes about Marlboro, \\"You will find the Marlboro adventure far more intense and intellectually demanding than Harvard, any other Ivy, or Ivy clone. There simply is no comparison.\\"Pope, Loren. Colleges That Change Lives, 3rd edition, 2006, p. 10. Marlboro College received a perfect academics rating of 99 and was also ranked #1 nationally for its quality of professors (\\"Professors Get High Marks\\") in The Princeton Review's 2014 annual college guide. = Beautiful Minds Challenge = Since 2012 the college has offered the Beautiful Minds Challenge, an essay contest for high school students that rewards winners with 12 full or partial scholarships and other prizes. Essays may take the form of text, images, audio, or video. Submissions are judged by Marlboro faculty, staff, and students. Finalists are flown to the Marlboro campus for a Symposium where they present their work. The Beautiful Minds Challenge was discontinued after the 2018 competition.

During the Spring and Fall, students were encouraged to \\"plant, weed, landscape, and harvest on a regular basis\\" on the school farm. Once a semester, a campuswide Work Day, in the spirit of the original class that built their own dormitories, encouraged students, staff, and faculty to maintain campus through various projects that change depending on the needs of the campus. \\"Midnight Breakfast\\" was an event celebrated each semester the eve before writing portfolios are due. The school was founded on and continues to encourage a tradition of community participation and values. A weekly \\"town meeting\\" allowed all community members to gather and vote to change the college bylaws. An elected community court dispensed justice when necessary. Different elected committees, consisting of students, faculty and staff, helped to hire faculty (or even college presidents) and steer the curriculum, among many other responsibilities. The library was also open all night and used a self-checkout honor system to keep track of borrowed materials. All buildings, academic and residential, were open 24/7 to allow students to access materials and workspaces at their discretion. Athletics were also shaped by Marlboro's location, and by Vermont's long winters - the coldest weather coincides with the academic year. Though few organized sports teams existed, the school's \\"Outdoor Program\\" promoted activities such as rock climbing, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, white-water kayaking, caving, canoeing, hiking, and the annual February broomball tournament, a collegiate tradition maintained since 1998. In addition, the College was just 15 miles from the Mount Snow ski resort. Student publications Editors-in-chief of the College's different magazines were elected during town meetings. The administration of the school published a biannual magazine, Potash Hill. A student newspaper, The Citizen, was published monthly on campus. \\"Articles in The Citizen vary from serious editorials to tongue-in-cheek campus news, from oblique photo-essays to ‚ÄúHorrorscopes‚Äù like ‚ÄúSagittarius: Money from strangers can be expected.

He is among the best known Quebec writers in English Canada. Life He was born in Sainte-Justine, Quebec and studied at Coll√®ge St-Louis in New Brunswick, the Universit√© de Montr√©al in Quebec, and at the Sorbonne, in Paris, France, where he received a doctorate in literature. From 1994 to 1997, he served as head of the Canada Council. In 1998, he ran as an electoral candidate for the Quebec Liberal Party under Jean Charest, in the riding of Cr√©mazie. He was defeated by 309 votes. In 1991, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. From 1999 to 2004, Carrier was National Librarian of Canada. With Ian E. Wilson, the then National Archivist, he developed the process to unify the National Archive and National Library. In 1992, Carrier's Prayers of a Very Wise Child (Pri√®res d'un enfant tr√®s tr√®s sage) won the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour. Carrier championed Jacques Poulin's novel Volkswagen Blues in Canada Reads 2005. Also involved in theatre (having served as playwright at the Th√©√¢tre du Nouveau Monde), Carrier has adapted La guerre, yes sir! and Floralie, o√π es- tu? for the stage. La guerre, yes sir! was produced as a play in 1970, was performed in English at the Stratford festival, and has been made into a film. Floralie, o√π es-tu? was performed by Th√©√¢tre du Nouveau-Monde in 1974. The trilogy consisting of these two novels and Il est par l√†, le soleil sold better in English than in French. A quote from \\"Le chandail de hockey\\" (\\"The Hockey Sweater\\"), one of Carrier's contes, was reprinted on the back of the Canadian five-dollar bill. The story, about when Carrier was a young boy who orders a Montreal Canadiens sweater from the Eaton's catalogue, but receives a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey instead, is considered by many to be a literary allegory for the linguistic and cultural tensions between English and French Canadians, and is thus considered essential reading for anybody who seeks to understand the complex realities of linguistic and cultural identity in Canada. But it is also a much-beloved children's story in anglophone Canada without such complex overtones as it may have in a broader context. The National Film Board of Canada has made this story into an animated short film, narrated by Carrier in both the French and English versions.Play films - Focus on Animation - ONF Heartbreaks Along The Road (De l'amour dans la ferraille) is a work of magical realism - he pokes fun at political and religious figures, using ridiculous scenarios, and exaggerated personality characteristics, while telling the story from different characters' points of view. There are many levels to his satire and his writing is flowery and descriptive. Sheila Fischman has won various awards for translation of his books into English. Two schools are named after Roch Carrier: Roch Carrier French Immersion Public School in Woodstock, Ontario, and Roch Carrier Elementary School in Kanata, Ontario is named after him.

On September 2, 2008, the US Department of Commerce, following three years of review and comments from \\"public, research communities, manufacturers, voluntary standards organizations, and Federal, State, and local government organizations\\", announced that FIPS 6-4 was one of ten FIPS standards withdrawn by the department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Deemed \\"obsolete, or have not been updated to adopt current voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, federal data standards, or current good practices for information security\\", the NIST replaced FIPS 6-4 with \\"INCITS 31 ‚Äì 2009\\" codes for the \\"Identification of the States and Equivalent Areas within the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Insular Areas\\". The five-digit codes of FIPS 6-4 used the two digit FIPS state code (FIPS Publication 5-2, also withdrawn on September 2, 2008), followed by the three digits of the county code within the state or possession. County FIPS codes in the United States are usually (with a few exceptions) in the same sequence as alphabetized county names within a state. They are usually (but not always) odd numbers, so that new or changed county names can be fit in their alphabetical sequence slot. In response to the NIST decision, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that it would replace the FIPS 6-4 codes with the INCITS 31 codes after the 2010 Census, with the Census bureau assigning new codes as needed for their internal use during the transition. The Census Bureau decided that, based on decades of using the terminology FIPS to describe its codes, it would continue to use the FIPS name for its updated codes, where FIPS now stood for FIP \\"Series\\", since there no longer existed an official FIP \\"Standard\\". FIPS county codes were also used by the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) to define geographic locations for their SAME-based public alerting systems. In this application, a \\"0\\" (zero) is added as the first digit and used as a \\"placeholder\\", making each FIPS code a six- digit sequence. In the future, the first digit may be utilized in this numerical scheme to represent a predefined county subdivision.

He is regarded as a leader of the First and Second Intifadas. Barghouti at one time supported the peace process, but later became disillusioned, and after 2000 went on to become a leader of the Second Intifada from the West Bank.Bahaa, Sherine. \\"'Israel's enemy number one'\\" . Al-Ahram Weekly 18‚Äì24 April 2002. Issue no. 582. Accessed 9 August 2011. Barghouti was a leader of Tanzim, a paramilitary offshoot of Fatah. Israeli authorities have called Barghouti a terrorist, accusing him of directing numerous attacks, including suicide bombings, against civilian and military targets alike.Marwan Barghouti incitement. Accessed: 29 August 2010. Barghouti was arrested by Israel Defense Forces in 2002 in Ramallah. He was tried and convicted on charges of murder, and sentenced to five life sentences. Marwan Barghouti refused to present a defense to the charges brought against him, maintaining throughout that the trial was illegal and illegitimate. Barghouti still exerts great influence in Fatah from within prison. With popularity reaching further than that, there has been some speculation whether he could be a unifying candidate in a bid to succeed Mahmud Abbas. In the negotiations over the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for the captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Hamas insisted on including Barghouti in the deal with Israel. However, Israel was unwilling to concede to that demand and despite initial reports that he indeed was to be released in the 11 October 2011 deal between Israel and Hamas, it was soon denied by Israeli sources. In November 2014, Barghouti urged the Palestinian Authority to immediately end security cooperation with Israel and called for a Third Intifada against Israel.Umberto Bacchi, Marwan Barghouti Calls Third Intifada Against Israel. 11 November 2014, International Business Times.  Biography  Barghouti was born in the village of Kobar near Ramallah, and comes from the Barghouti clan, an extended family from Deir Ghassaneh. Mustafa Barghouti, a fellow Palestinian political figure, is a distant cousin. Barghouti was one of seven children, and his father was a migrant worker in Lebanon. His younger brother Muqbel described him as \\"a naughty and rebellious boy\\". Barghouti joined Fatah at age 15, and he was a co-founder of the Fatah Youth Movement (Shabiba) on the West Bank. By the age of 18 in 1976, Barghouti was arrested by Israel for his involvement with Palestinian militant groups. He completed his secondary education and received a high school diploma while serving a four-year term in jail, where he gained fluency in Hebrew.Lisa Hajjar, 'Interview with Marwan Barghouti' in Joel Beinin, Rebecca L. Stein (eds.),The Struggle for Sovereignty: Palestine and Israel, 1993-2005, Stanford University Press, 2006 p.105. Barghouti enrolled at Birzeit University (BZU) in 1983, though arrest and exile meant that he did not receive his B.A. (History and Political Science) until 1994. He earned an M.A. in International Relations, also from Birzeit, in 1998. As an undergraduate, he was active in student politics on behalf of Fatah and headed the BZU Student Council. On 21 October 1984, he married a fellow student, Fadwa Ibrahim. Fadwa took bachelor's and master's degrees in law and was a prominent advocate in her own right on behalf of Palestinian prisoners, before becoming the leading campaigner for her husband‚Äôs release from his current jail term. The couple has a daughter, Ruba (born 1986), and three sons, Qassam (born 1985), Sharaf (born 1989) and Arab (born 1990).  First Intifada, the Oslo Accords and the aftermath Barghouti became one of the major leaders in the West Bank of the First Intifada in 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation. During the uprising, he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan for incitement, where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994. Although he was a strong supporter of the peace process he doubted that Israel was committed to land-for-peace deals. In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, following which he began his active advocacy of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Barghouti campaigned against corruption in Arafat's administration and human rights violations by its security services, and he established relationships with a number of Israeli politicians and members of Israel's peace movement. The formal position occupied by Barghouti was Secretary-General of Fatah in the West Bank. By the summer of 2000, particularly after the Camp David summit failed, Barghouti was disillusioned and said that popular protests and \\"new forms of military struggle\\" would be features of the \\"next Intifada\\".  Second Intifada  A portrait of Marwan Barghouti on the wall by Qalandia. In September 2000, the Second Intifada began. Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah armed branch, the Tanzim, seen as one of the major forces fighting against the Israel Defense Forces. Barghouti led marches to Israeli checkpoints, where riots broke out against Israeli soldiers and spurred on Palestinians in speeches at funerals and demonstrations, condoning the use of force to expel Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He has stated that, \\"I, and the Fatah movement to which I belong, strongly oppose attacks and the targeting of civilians inside Israel, our future neighbor, I reserve the right to protect myself, to resist the Israeli occupation of my country and to fight for my freedom\\" and has said, \\"I still seek peaceful coexistence between the equal and independent countries of Israel and Palestine based on full withdrawal from Palestinian territories occupied in 1967.\\" As the Palestinian death toll in the Second Intifada increased, Barghouti called for Palestinians to target Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. During the second intifada Barghouti was accused by Israel of being a senior member of the Al- Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, an organization which conducted numerous attacks and suicide bombings on civilians both within and outside of Israel proper, and has been accused of having directed some of these bombings personally. While some Palestinian militants advocated adopting tactics based on those used by Hezbollah to drive the Israeli army out of Lebanon, Barghouti was seen as less radical, supporting violent actions based on popular movements but exclusively within the Palestinian territories.Gilead Sher, The Israeli-Palestinian Peace Negotiations, 1999-2001: Within Reach, Taylor & Francis, 2006 p.183. According to National Public Radio, Barghouti \\"cut his ideological teeth as the political leader of Fatah's armed militant wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. = Israeli trial and imprisonment = Israel accused him of founding the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and attempted to assassinate him in 2001. The missile hit his bodyguard's car, killing the bodyguard. Barghouti survived but was arrested by the Israeli Army in Ramallah, on 15 April 2002 and transferred to the 'Russian Compound' police station in Jerusalem. Amos Harel wrote in Haaretz that Barghouti was arrested by soldiers of the Duchifat Battalion who had approached the building hidden in an ambulance to avoid detection: \\"The Duchifat soldiers were squeezed into a protected ambulance in order to arrive as quickly as possible at the house where Barghouti was hiding, and to seal it off.\\" Several months later, he was indicted in an Israeli civilian court on 26 charges of murder and attempted murder stemming from attacks carried out by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades on Israeli civilians and soldiers.Full indictment, Israel Ministry of Foreign AffairsIndictment appendix listing all charges Marwan Barghouti refused to present a defense to the charges brought against him, maintaining throughout that the trial was illegal and illegitimate. The Israeli verdict against him in effect removed Arafat's only political rival.Colin Shindler A History of Modern Israel, Cambridge University Press, 2013 p.337. Barghouti stressed that he supported armed resistance to the Israeli occupation, but condemned attacks on civilians inside Israel. According to the case argued by Israel at his trial, he had supported and authorized such attacks. On 20 May 2004, he was convicted of five counts of murder: authorizing and organizing the murder of Georgios Tsibouktzakis, a shooting adjacent to Giv'at Ze'ev in which a civilian was killed, and the Seafood Market attack in Tel Aviv in which three civilians were killed. In addition, he was convicted of attempted murder for a failed car bomb attack near Malha Mall that exploded prematurely, resulting in the deaths of two suicide bombers, and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization. He was acquitted of 21 counts of murder in 33 other attacks as no proof was brought to link Barghouti directly with the specific decisions of the local leadership of the Tanzim to carry out these particular attacks.Barghouti Found Guilty of 5 Murders, Haaretz, 21st May 2004 On 6 June 2004, he was sentenced to the maximum possible punishment for his convictions: five cumulative life sentences for the murders and an additional 40 years, consisting of 20 years each for attempted murder and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization. The Inter-Parliamentary Union reviewed the case and released a report that criticized Barghouti's arrest, treatment while in detention, and trial. It said his rights were violated and international treaties and norms were contravened.Simon Foreman 'The trial of Mr. Marwan Barghouti,' Inter-Parliamentary Union 2003.The Inter-Parliamentary Union report is widely cited, including:   = Campaign for release = A portrait of Marwan Barghouti at a demonstration at Kafr ad-Dik. Since Barghouti's arrest, many of his supporters have campaigned for his release. They include prominent Palestinian figures, members of European Parliament and the Israeli group Gush Shalom. Reuters reported that some see Barghouti \\"as a Palestinian Nelson Mandela, the man who could galvanize a drifting and divided national movement if only he were set free by Israel\\". According to The Jerusalem Post, \\"[u]nlike many in the Western media, Palestinian journalists and writers have rarely - if ever - referred to Barghouti as...the 'Palestinian Nelson Mandela.'\\" Another approach is to suggest that Israel's freeing of Barghouti would be an excellent show of good faith in the peace process. This view gained popularity among the Israeli left after the 2005 Disengagement from the Gaza Strip. Still others, operating from a realpolitik perspective, have pointed out that allowing Barghouti to re-enter Palestinian politics could serve to bolster Fatah against gains in Hamas' popularity.\\"The Blame Game ‚Äì Forward.com\\" According to Pinhas Inbari of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, > \\"Hamas understands it needs to provide its supporters with some comfort, > especially seeing the suffering of the Palestinian people. For this reason, > Hamas is willing to accept Barghouti's release and to deal with him after he > is free. Without the severe state of the Palestinian people, Hamas would > object to the release of Barghouti.\\"On the chances of the release of Gilad > Shalit (Hebrew) , Pinhas Inbari, 20 December 2007 Following Barghouti's January 2006 re-election to the Palestinian Legislative Council, a debate over Barghouti's fate began anew in Israel, ranging from former MK Yossi Beilin's support for a Presidential pardon to the total refusal of any idea of early release. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom stated, > \\"We must not forget that he is a cold-blooded murderer who was sentenced by > the court to five life sentences‚Ä¶ It is out of the question to free an > assassin who has blood on his hands and was duly sentenced by a court.\\" However several MKs, including Kadima MK Meir Sheetrit, suggested that Barghouti will likely be released as part of future peace negotiations, although they did not specify when. In January 2007, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres declared that he would sign a presidential pardon for Marwan Barghouti if elected to the Israeli presidency. However, despite Peres winning the presidency, a pardon was not issued.  Split from Fatah  A portrait of Marwan Barghouti at a demonstration at Beit Ummar. On 14 December 2005, Barghouti announced that he had formed a new political party, al- Mustaqbal (\\"The Future\\"), mainly composed of members of Fatah's \\"Young Guard\\", who repeatedly expressed frustration with the entrenched corruption in the party. The list, which was presented to the Palestinian Authority's central elections committee on that day, included Mohammed Dahlan, Kadoura Fares, Samir Mashharawi and Jibril Rajoub. The split followed Barghouti's earlier refusal of Mahmoud Abbas' offer to be second on the Fatah party's parliamentary list, behind Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei. Barghouti had actually topped the list,\\"Fatah splits before key election\\". BBC News. 15 December 2005. Accessed 9 August 2011. but this had not become apparent until after the new party had been registered. Reactions to the news was split. Some suggested that the move was a positive step towards peace, as Barghouti's new party could help reform major problems in Palestinian government. Others raised concern that it could wind up splitting the Fatah vote, inadvertently helping Hamas. Barghouti's supporters argued that al-Mustaqbal would split the votes of both parties, both from disenchanted Fatah members as well as moderate Hamas voters who do not agree with Hamas' political goals, but rather its social work and hard position on corruption. Some observers also hypothesized that the formation of al-Mustaqbal was mostly a negotiating tactic to get members of the Young Guard into higher positions of power within Fatah and its electoral list. Barghouti eventually was convinced that the idea of leading a new party, especially one that was created by splitting from Fatah, would be unrealistic while he was still in prison. Instead he stood as a Fatah candidate in the January 2006 PLC elections, comfortably regaining his seat in the Palestinian Parliament.  Political activity in prison  In late 2004, Barghouti announced from his Israeli prison his intention to run in the Palestinian Authority presidential election in January 2005, called for following the death of President Yasser Arafat in November. On 26 November 2004, it appeared he would withdraw from the contest following pressure from the Fatah faction to support the candidacy of Mahmoud Abbas. However, just before the deadline on 1 December, Barghouti's wife registered him as an independent candidate. On 12 December, facing pressure from FatahBarghouti withdrawal leaves Abbas with clear path to succeed Arafat to withdraw in favor of Abbas, he chose to abandon his candidacy for the benefit of Palestinian unity. On 11 May 2006, Palestinian leaders held in Israeli prisons released the National Conciliation Document of the Prisoners. The document was a proposal initiated by Marwan Barghouti and leaders of Hamas, the PFLP, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the DFLP that proposed a basis upon which a coalition government should be formed in the Palestinian Legislative Council. This came as a result of the political stalemate in the Palestinian territories that followed Hamas' election to the PLC in January 2006. Crucially, the document also called for negotiation with the state of Israel in order to achieve lasting peace. The document quickly gained popular currency and is now considered the bedrock upon which a national unity government should be achieved. According to Haaretz, Barghouti, although not officially represented in the negotiations of a Palestinian unity government in February 2007, played a major role in mediating between Hamas and Fatah and formulating the compromise reached on 8 February 2007.article In 2009, he was elected to party leadership at the Fatah Conference in Bethlehem. In April 2017 he organized a hunger strike of Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails.Hunger strike puts jailed Palestinian in spotlight, Fox news from AP wire, 21 April 2017 He laid out the motivation behind the strike in an op-ed in The New York Times.Why We Are on Hunger Strike in Israel‚Äôs Prison, 16 April 2017 On 7 May, the Israel Prison Service released a video allegedly showing Barghouti secretly eating snacks in his prison cell, once on 27 April and again on 5 May.Palestinian hunger strike leader Barghouti 'filmed eating', BBC, 8 May 2017Did hunger striking Palestinian prisoner Barghouti just eat some cookies?

According to polling data in mid-2012, 60% of Palestinians would vote for him for president of the Palestinian Authority if they were given that chance, and he would beat both Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh for the top post.

Construction commenced in 1072 and continued in several phases throughout the High Middle Ages. Like many of the medieval cathedrals of England it was built in the Early Gothic style. Although considered doubtful by some, many historians claim it was the tallest building in the world for 238 years (1311‚Äì1548), if so the first building to hold that title after the Great Pyramid of Giza.Mary Jane Taber (1905), The cathedrals of England: an account of some of their distinguishing characteristics, p.100. The central spire collapsed in 1548 and was not rebuilt. Had the central spire remained intact, Lincoln Cathedral would have remained the world's tallest structure until the completion of the Eiffel Tower in 1889. For hundreds of years the cathedral held one of the four remaining copies of the original Magna Carta, now securely displayed in Lincoln Castle. The cathedral is the fourth largest in the UK (in floor area) at around , after Liverpool, St Paul's and York Minster. It is highly regarded by architectural scholars; the Victorian writer John Ruskin declared: \\"I have always held ... that the cathedral of Lincoln is out and out the most precious piece of architecture in the British Isles and roughly speaking worth any two other cathedrals we have.\\"  History  Remigius de F√©camp, the first Bishop of Lincoln, moved the episcopal seat (cathedra) there \\"some time between 1072 and 1092\\".The Penny magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Volumes 1‚Äì2, 1832, p. 132. About this, James Essex writes that \\"Remigius ... laid the foundations of his Cathedral in 1072\\" and \\"it is probable that he, being a Norman, employed Norman masons to superintend the building ... though he could not complete the whole before his death.\\"Essex, J., Some observations on Lincoln Cathedral. Read at the Society of Antiquaries, 16 March 1775, printed by W. Bowyer and J. Nichols, 1776. Before that, writes B. Winkles, \\"It is well known that Remigius appropriated the parish church of St Mary Magdalene in Lincoln, although it is not known what use he made of it.\\"Winkles, B., Winkles's Architectural and Picturesque Illustrations of the Cathedral Churches of England and Wales: Lincoln cathedral. Chichester cathedral. Ely cathedral. Peterborough cathedral. Norwich cathedral. Exeter cathedral. Bristol cathedral. Oxford cathedral, Wilson, 1838, p. 1. Model within the cathedral illustrating the cathedral's former spires 17th century print of Lincoln Cathedral with spires on the west towers Up until then St. Mary's Church in Stow was considered to be the \\"mother church\\" of Lincolnshire (although it was not a cathedral, because the seat of the diocese was at Dorchester Abbey in Dorchester-on-Thames, Oxfordshire). However, Lincoln was more central to a diocese that stretched from the Thames to the Humber. Remigius built the first Lincoln Cathedral on the present site, finishing it in 1092 and then dying on 7 May of that year, two days before it was consecrated. In 1124, the timber roofing was destroyed in a fire. Alexander (bishop, 1123‚Äì48) rebuilt and expanded the cathedral, but it was mostly destroyed by an earthquake about forty years later, in 1185 (dated by the British Geological Survey as occurring 15 April 1185). The earthquake was one of the largest felt in the UK: it has an estimated magnitude of over 5. The damage to the cathedral is thought to have been very extensive: the Cathedral is described as having \\"split from top to bottom\\"; in the current building, only the lower part of the west end and its two attached towers remain of the pre-earthquake cathedral. Some (Kidson, 1986; Woo, 1991) have suggested that the damage to Lincoln Cathedral was probably exaggerated by poor construction or design, with the actual collapse most probably caused by a vault failure. After the earthquake, a new bishop was appointed. He was Hugh de Burgundy of Avalon, France, who became known as St Hugh of Lincoln. He began a massive rebuilding and expansion programme. With his appointment of William de Montibus as master of the cathedral school and chancellor, Lincoln briefly became one of the leading educational centres in England, producing writers such as Samuel Presbiter and Richard of Wetheringsett, though it declined in importance after William's death in 1213. Rebuilding began with the choir (St Hugh's Choir) and the eastern transepts between 1192 and 1210. The central nave was then built in the Early English Gothic architectural style. Lincoln Cathedral soon followed other architectural advances of the time ‚Äì pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting were added to the cathedral. This allowed support for incorporating larger windows. There are thirteen bells in the south-west tower, two in the north-west tower, and five in the central tower (including Great Tom). Accompanying the cathedral's large bell, Great Tom of Lincoln, is a quarter-hour striking clock. The clock was installed in the early 19th century. The two large stained glass rose windows, the matching Dean's Eye and Bishop's Eye, were added to the cathedral during the late Middle Ages. The former, the Dean's Eye in the north transept dates from the 1192 rebuild begun by St Hugh, finally being completed in 1235. The latter, the Bishop's Eye, in the south transept was reconstructed a hundred years later in 1330. A contemporary record, ‚ÄúThe Metrical Life of St Hugh‚Äù, refers to the meaning of these two windows (one on the dark, north, side and the other on the light, south, side of the building): \\"For north represents the devil, and south the Holy Spirit and it is in these directions that the two eyes look. The bishop faces the south in order to invite in and the dean the north in order to shun; the one takes care to be saved, the other takes care not to perish. With these Eyes the cathedral's face is on watch for the candelabra of Heaven and the darkness of Lethe (oblivion).\\" Main door of the cathedral Norman West front After the additions of the Dean's eye and other major Gothic additions it is believed some mistakes in the support of the tower occurred, for in 1237 the main tower collapsed. A new tower was soon started and in 1255 the Cathedral petitioned Henry III to allow them to take down part of the town wall to enlarge and expand the Cathedral, including the rebuilding of the central tower and spire. They replaced the small rounded chapels (built at the time of St Hugh) with a larger east end to the cathedral. This was to handle the increasing number of pilgrims to the Cathedral, who came to worship at the shrine of Hugh of Lincoln. In 1290 Eleanor of Castile died and King Edward I of England decided to honour her, his Queen Consort, with an elegant funeral procession. After her body had been embalmed, which in the 13th century involved evisceration, Eleanor's viscera were buried in Lincoln cathedral and Edward placed a duplicate of the Westminster Abbey tomb there. The Lincoln tomb's original stone chest survives; its effigy was destroyed in the 17th century and replaced with a 19th-century copy. On the outside of Lincoln Cathedral are two prominent statues often identified as Edward and Eleanor, but these images were heavily restored in the 19th century and they were probably not originally intended to depict the couple. Between 1307 and 1311 the central tower was raised to its present height of . The western towers and front of the cathedral were also improved and heightened. At this time, a tall lead-encased wooden spire topped the central tower but was blown down in a storm in 1548. With its spire, the tower reputedly reached a height of 525 feet (160 m) (which would have made it the world's tallest structure, surpassing the Great Pyramid of Giza, which held the record for almost 4,000 years). Although still doubted, this is the height agreed upon by the majority of historians.Haughton, Brian (2007), Hidden History: Lost Civilizations, Secret Knowledge, and Ancient Mysteries, p. 167.Michael Woods, Mary B Woods (2009), Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, p. 41.Darwin Porter, Danforth Prince (2010), Frommer's England 2010, p. 588. Other additions to the cathedral at this time included its elaborate carved screen and the 14th-century misericords, as was the Angel Choir. For a large part of the length of the cathedral, the walls have arches in relief with a second layer in front to give the illusion of a passageway along the wall. However the illusion does not work, as the stonemason, copying techniques from France, did not make the arches the correct length needed for the illusion to be effective. In 1398 John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford founded a chantry in the cathedral to pray for the welfare of their souls. In the 15th century the building of the cathedral turned to chantry or memorial chapels. The chapels next to the Angel Choir were built in the Perpendicular style, with an emphasis on strong vertical lines, which survive today in the window tracery and wall panelling. = Magna Carta = Hugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln, was one of the signatories to Magna Carta and for hundreds of years the cathedral held one of the four remaining copies of the original, now securely displayed in Lincoln Castle. The Lincoln Magna Carta was on display at the British Pavilion during the 1939 New York World's Fair. In March 1941, the Foreign Office proposed that the Lincoln Magna Carta be gifted to the United States, citing the \\"many thousands of Americans who waited in long queues to view it\\" and the US passage of the Lend-Lease Act, among other reasons. In 2009 the Lincoln Magna Carta was lent to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. There are three other surviving copies: two at the British Library and one at Salisbury Cathedral. = Little Saint Hugh = In August 1255 the body of an eight-year-old boy was found in a well in Lincoln. He had been missing for nearly a month. This incident became the source of a blood libel in the city, with Jews accused of his abduction, torture, and murder. Many Jews were arrested and eighteen were hanged. The boy became named as Little Saint Hugh to distinguish him from Saint Hugh of Lincoln, but he was never officially canonised. The cathedral benefited from these events because Hugh was seen as a martyr, and many devotees came to the city and cathedral to venerate him. Geoffrey Chaucer mentions the case in \\"The Prioress's Tale\\" and a ballad was written about it in 1783. In 1955 a plaque was put up near \\"the remains of the shrine of 'Little St Hugh in the cathedral, that decries the \\"Trumped up stories of 'ritual murders' of Christian boys by Jewish communities.\\"  Features  = Lincoln Imp = The Lincoln Imp One of the stone carvings within the cathedral is the Lincoln Imp. There are several variations of the legend surrounding the figure. According to 14th-century legend, two mischievous imps were sent by Satan to do evil work on Earth. After causing mayhem elsewhere in Northern England the two imps headed to Lincoln Cathedral, where they smashed tables and chairs and tripped up the Bishop. An angel appeared in the Angel Choir and ordered them to stop. One of the imps sat atop a stone pillar and started throwing stones at the angel whilst the other cowered under the broken tables and chairs. The angel turned the first imp to stone, allowing the second imp to escape. The imp that turned to stone can still be found sitting atop his stone column in the Angel Choir. They also are one of the many carved animals on the structure. = Wren library = The Wren Library houses a rare collection of over 277 manuscripts, including the text of the Venerable Bede. = Rose windows = The Bishop's Eye rose window Lincoln Cathedral features two major rose windows, which are a highly uncommon feature among medieval architecture in England. On the north side of the cathedral there is the ‚ÄúDean's Eye‚Äù which survives from the original structure of the building and on the south side there is the ‚ÄúBishop's Eye‚Äù which was most likely rebuilt circa 1325‚Äì1350. This south window is one of the largest examples of curvilinear tracery seen in medieval architecture. Curvilinear tracery is a form of tracery where the patterns are continuous curves. This form was often done within pointed arches and squared windows because those are the easiest shapes, so the circular space of the window was a unique challenge to the designers. A solution was created that called for the circle to be divided down into smaller shapes that would make it simpler to design and create. Curves were drawn within the window which created four distinct areas of the circle. This made the spaces within the circle where the tracery would go much smaller, and easier to work with. This window is also interesting and unique in that the focus of the tracery was shifted away from the centre of the circle and instead placed in other sections. The glazing of the window was equally difficult as the tracery for many of the same reason; therefore, the designers made a decision to cut back on the amount of iconography within the window. Most cathedral windows during this time displayed many colourful images of the Bible; however, at Lincoln there are very few images. Some of those images that can be seen within the window include saints Paul, Andrew, and James. = Wooden trusses = Wooden trusses offer a solid and reliable source of support for building because, through their joints, they are able to resist damage and remain strong. Triangles are the strongest shape because, no matter where the force is being placed on them, they are able to use their three joints to their fullest extent to withstand it. Making trusses with triangles inside larger triangles adds even more strength, as seen in Lincoln's choir. The design of all wooden trusses is a tedious task as there are many different things that need to be considered while building these supports. There are many different ways that the trusses can fail, if they are not designed or built properly; it is therefore crucial to design trusses that suit a specific building with specific needs in mind. The simplest form of a truss is an A-frame; however, the great amount of outward thrust generated by this often causes the truss to fail. The addition of a tie beam creates a triangular shape, although this beam can sometimes sag if the overall truss is too large. Neither one of these types would have been suitable for Lincoln, owing to the sheer size of the roof. They would have failed to support the building, so collar beams and queen posts were added to help prevent sagging. To protect against wind damage, braces were added. Secondary rafters were also added to the design to ensure that the weight was equally distributed. Saint Hugh's Choir has a total of thirty six trusses keeping the roof in place, and it is held up entirely by means of its own weight and forces. = Vaults = 183x183px One major architectural feature of Lincoln Cathedral are the spectacular vaults. The varying vaults within the cathedral are said to be both original and experimental. The vaults especially, clearly define the experimental aspect seen at Lincoln. There are several different kinds of vaults that differ between the nave, aisles, choir, and chapels of the cathedral. Along the North Aisle there is a continuous ridge rib with a regular arcade that ignores the bays. Meanwhile, on the South Aisle there is a discontinuous ridge rib that puts an emphasis on each separate bay. The North West Chapel has quadripartite vaults and the South Chapel has vaults that stem from one central support columns. The use of sexpartite vaults allowed for more natural light to enter the cathedral through the clerestory windows, which were placed inside of each separate bay. Saint Hugh's Choir exhibits extremely unusual vaults. It is a series of asymmetrical vaults that appear to almost be a diagonal line created by two ribs on one side translating into only a single rib on the other side of the vault. This pattern divides up the space of the vaults and bays, perfectly placing the emphasis on the bays. The chapter house vaults are also interesting. It is a decagonal building with a single, central column that twenty ribs rise from. Each separate area of Lincoln can be identified solely by the different vaults of the space. Each vault, or each variation of the vault, is fresh and original. The vaults are attributed to French-Normand master mason Geoffrey de Noiers. de Noiers was succeeded by Alexander the Mason, who developed the nave's more elaborate, but symmetrical tierceron vaulting, the crossing vaulting, Galilee Porch and western facade screen. Vault of Angel Choir Crossing of Secondary transept Vault of Entrance to Chapter House Vault of Secondary Transept Vault of Main Transepts Vault of Nave - Lincoln Cathedral = Tower clock = A clock by John Thwaite was installed in the north west tower in 1775. This was later improved by Benjamin Vulliamy and moved to the broad tower around 1835. It was replaced in 1880 by a new clock under the instruction of Edmund Beckett QC. The clock was built by Potts and Sons of Leeds. Cambridge Chimes were a feature of the new clock. The clock featured a double three-legged gravity escapement to the designs of Edmund Beckett. The machinery weighs about , with the driving weights being , suspended by steel-wire ropes long, and the pendulum weight of . The beat is 1.5 seconds. The hour hammer is , striking upon Great Tom. The striking trains require winding daily, when done manually it took 20 minutes. The going train required winding twice per week. The clock mechanism contains the inscription Quod bene vortat Deus Opt. Max., Consiliis Edmundi Beckett, Baronetti, LL.D., Opera Gul. Potts et Filiorum, civium Leodiensium, Sumptibus Decani et Capituli, Novum in Turri positum est Horologium, A.D. MDCCCLXXX. Angel Choir Details  Modern history  Floor plan A view of the nave Interior view of the crossing tower = Wartime history = Lincolnshire was home to many Bomber Command airfields during the Second World War, giving rise to the nickname of \\"Bomber County\\". The station badge for the nearby RAF Waddington depicts Lincoln Cathedral rising through the clouds. Until the opening of the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in 2012, the cathedral had the only memorial in the United Kingdom dedicated to Bomber Command's large losses of aircrewAntiques Roadshow, from Lincoln Cathedral in the Second World War. During the war, \\"priceless British treasures\\" were placed in a chamber sixty feet beneath the cathedral for safekeeping. This did not include the cathedral's copy of the Magna Carta as it was on loan in the United States. = 21st century = A gilded crown recently installed on one of the towers. Stonework commemorating the end of fox hunting ‚Äì a fox can be seen hiding in the foliage. Maintaining the cathedral costs ¬£1.6 million a year. A major renovation of the West Front was done in 2000. It was discovered that the flying buttresses on the east end were no longer connected to the adjoining stonework, and repairs were made to prevent collapse. The most recent problem was the discovery that the stonework of the Dean's Eye window in the transept was crumbling, meaning that a complete reconstruction of the window has had to be carried out according to the conservation criteria set out by the International Council on Monuments and Sites. There was a period of great anxiety when it emerged that the stonework needed to shift only for the entire window to collapse. Specialist engineers removed the window's tracery before installing a strengthened, more stable replacement. In addition to this the original stained glass was cleaned and set behind a new clear isothermal glass which offers better protection from the elements. By April 2006 the renovation project was completed at a cost of ¬£2 million. Recently, concerns have been growing once more about the state of the West Front, as there has been some stonework falling, which has raised questions as to the effectiveness of the repairs carried out in 2000. Between 2006 and 2009, 200,000 to 208,000 people visited Lincoln Cathedral annually. In 2010 the figure dropped to 150,000, making it the 16th-most visited attraction in the East Midlands. The fall in visitor numbers was attributed to the cancellation of the Lincoln Christmas Market that year. The admission fee is ¬£8.00, with concessions. The Cathedral website states; \\"Everyone is free to enter and gaze at the glory of the nave; you can sit in the peace of the Morning Chapel or visit the shop. If you want to explore further, we do ask you to pay.\\" The cathedral offers tours of the cathedral, the tower and the roof. The peak of its season is the Lincoln Christmas Market, accompanied by a massive annual production of Handel's Messiah. An announcement in January 2020 stated that since 2016, archaeologists had found over 50 burials during the renovations, including a priest buried with a chalice and paten. Among the artifacts recovered, a coin depicts Edward the Confessor who was king from 1042 to 1066. During the dig, sections of some extensively decorated Roman buildings and related artifacts were also discovered. Some of the Roman, medieval and Saxon objects will be displayed at the visitor centre which was expected to open later in 2020. The cathedral was used for the filming of The Da Vinci Code (based on the book of the same name). Filming took place mainly within the cloisters, and chapter house, of the cathedral, and remained a closed set. The Cathedral took on the role of Westminster Abbey, as the Abbey had refused to permit filming. Although there was protest at the filming, the filming was completed by the end of August 2005. To make the Lincoln chapter house appear similar to the Westminster Chapter House, murals were painted on a special layer over the existing wall, and elsewhere polystyrene replicas of Isaac Newton's tomb and other Abbey monuments were set up. For a time these murals and replicas remained in the Chapter House, as part of a Da Vinci Code exhibit for visitors, but in January 2008 they were all sold off in an auction to raise money for the Cathedral. The cathedral also doubled as Westminster Abbey for the film Young Victoria, filmed in September 2007, and did again in June 2018 for the Netflix Shakespeare film The King. In 2019 the cathedral was featured in the Amazon motoring television series The Grand Tour, during which the presenters hosted a funeral for the mid-size Ford saloon as part of the third season's final episode.  Cathedral stone  Lincoln Cathedral is one of the few English cathedrals built from the rock it is standing on. The cathedral has owned the existing quarry, on Riseholme Road, Lincoln, since 1876. This quarry is expected to run out of stone in 2021. The cathedral's stonemasons use more than 100 tonnes of stone per year for maintenance and repairs.

The cathedral accepted female choristers in 1995. Lincoln was only the second cathedral in the country to adopt a separate girls' choir (after Salisbury Cathedral) and remains one of few which provides exactly the same musical opportunities and equal weekly singing duties to both girls and boys. The choristers can now attend any school and are currently drawn from ten local schools. The director of music is Aric Prentice, who conducts the choir of boys and men; the assistant director of music and sub-organist is Jeffrey Makinson, who conducts the choir of girls and men. The organist laureate is Colin Walsh, previously organist and master of the choristers and the assistant organist is Hilary Punnett. The records of cathedral organists at Lincoln are continuous from 1439 when John Ingleton was the incumbent. Notable organists have included the Renaissance composers William Byrd and John Reading and the biographer of Mendelssohn, William Thomas Freemantle. = Organ = The organ is one of the finest examples of the work of \\"Father\\" Henry Willis, dating from 1898. It was Willis' last cathedral organ before his death in 1901. It has undergone two restorations, in 1960 and 1998, by Harrison & Harrison. The organ specification can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register. The installation of a new organ was made possible in 1898, after a donation by a Lincoln industrialist, Alfred Shuttleworth, of ¬£1,000 towards the total cost of ¬£4,675 (). The remainder was met by several other individual donations and public subscription. The organ is one of only two Willis organs in English cathedrals which retain their original tonal scheme. The new organ, based on Willis's 1885 design, was dedicated on St Hugh's Day, 17 November 1898. It was intended to be the first British cathedral organ to be electrically powered. As Lincoln's power station had not yet entered service, however, it had to be pumped manually by soldiers of the Lincolnshire Regiment.

Lava flows at the summit crater appear in shades of green and brown, while vegetation zones appear as areas of purple, green and yellow on the volcano's flanks An image (from ) is an artifact that depicts visual perception, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture, that resembles a subject‚Äîusually a physical object‚Äîand thus provides a depiction of it. In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s). A pictorial script is a writing system that employs images as symbols for various semantic entities, rather than the abstract signs used by alphabets. Characteristics Images may be two-dimensional, such as a photograph or screen display, or three-dimensional, such as a statue or hologram. They may be captured by optical devices ‚Äì such as cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the human eye or water. The word 'image' is also used in the broader sense of any two- dimensional figure such as a map, a graph, a pie chart, a painting or a banner. In this wider sense, images can also be rendered manually, such as by drawing, the art of painting, carving, rendered automatically by printing or computer graphics technology, or developed by a combination of methods, especially in a pseudo-photograph. A volatile image is one that exists only for a short period of time. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a camera obscura, or a scene displayed on a cathode ray tube. A fixed image, also called a hard copy, is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as paper or textile by photography or any other digital process. A mental image exists in an individual's mind, as something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an abstract concept, such as a graph, function, or imaginary entity. For example, Sigmund Freud claimed to have dreamed purely in aural-images of dialogs. Different scholars of psychoanalysis as well as the social sciences such as Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek and Jan Berger have pointed out the possibility of manipulating mental images for ideological purposes. Images perpetuated in public education, media as well as popular culture have a profound impact on the formation of such mental images: > \\"What makes them so powerful is that they circumvent the faculties of the > conscious mind but, instead, directly target the subconscious and affective, > thus evading direct inquiry through contemplative reasoning. By doing so > such axiomatic images tell us what we shall desire (liberalism, in a > snapshot: the crunchy honey-flavored cereals and the freshly-pressed orange > juice in the back of a suburban one-family home) and from what we shall > obstain (communism, in a snapshot: lifeless crowds of men and machinery > marching towards certain perdition accompanied by the tunes of Soviet > Russian songs). What makes those images so powerful is that it is only of > relative minor relevance for the stabilization of such images whether they > actually capture and correspond with the multiple layers of reality, or > not.\\"  David Leupold, sociologist The development of synthetic acoustic technologies and the creation of sound art have led to a consideration of the possibilities of a sound-image made up of irreducible phonic substance beyond linguistic or musicological analysis. There are Two Types of Images a. Still Image b. Moving Image =Still or moving= A ' is a single static image. This phrase is used in photography, visual media and the computer industry to emphasize that one is not talking about movies, or in very precise or pedantic technical writing such as a standard. A ' is typically a movie (film) or video, including digital video. It could also be an animated display such as a zoetrope. A still frame is a still image derived from one frame of a moving one. In contrast, a film still is a photograph taken on the set of a movie or television program during production, used for promotional purposes.

It is the capital and most populated municipality of the Province of Segovia. Segovia is located in the Inner Plateau, near the northern slopes of the Sistema Central mountain range, straddling the course of the Eresma river. The city is famous for its historic buildings including three main landmarks: its midtown Roman aqueduct, its cathedral (one of the last ones to be built in Europe following a Gothic style), and the castle, which served as one of the templates for Walt Disney's Cinderella Castle. The city center of Segovia was declared World Heritage by UNESCO in 1985. Etymology The name of Segovia is of Celtiberian origin. Although historians have linked the old name of the city to ', the recent discovery of the original Roman city in the Spanish village of Saelices discarded this possibility. The name of \\"Segovia\\" is mentioned by Livy in the context of the Sertorian War. Under the Romans and Moors, the city was called Segovia (, Ptolomeo ii. 6. ¬ß 56) and () respectively. Geography =Location= Aerial view showing part of the city. Segovia is located on the plains of Old Castile, near Valladolid and the Spanish capital, Madrid. Segovia is one of nine provinces that make up the autonomous region of Castile and Le√≥n. Burgos and Valladolid lie to the north, √Åvila to the west, Madrid to the south, and Soria to the east. The altitude of the province varies from in the extreme northwest to a maximum of at Pe√±alara peak in the Sierra de Guadarrama. The town lies on the main route of the Camino de Santiago de Madrid. =Climate= The climate is hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa in the K√∂ppen climate classification) near the boundaries of Csb and BSk, resulting from the high altitude and the distance from the coast. The average annual temperature is , with an average low in January of and an average high in July of . The annual precipitation range from 400 to 500 mm per year in the lower plains, and can reach above 1000 mm in the nearby mountainous area of Sierra de Guadarrama, as rainfall and snowfall is more frequent up the mountains. Decent showers coming from summer thunderstorms help the mountainous area of the province to be rainier than average than most of the central Spanish plateau, which gives the area lush vegetation. All of this make the province a damp corner in the context of the region. The predominant forms of vegetation in the mountainous areas include pine, evergreen, oak, beech and juniper. =Population centers= Aside from the main city, there are a number of other villages within the municipality of Segovia. * Fuentemilanos * Hontoria * Madrona * Revenga, established in 1983 as a \\"minor local entity\\" (Spanish: '), a category of sub-municipal entities in Spain. * Zamarramala * Torredondo * Perogordo History 1562 drawing of Segovia by Anton van den Wyngaerde. The first recorded mention of a settlement in what is today Segovia was a Celtic possession. Control later passed into the hands of the Romans. The city is a possible site of the battle in 75 BC where Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius was victorious over Quintus Sertorius and Hirtuleius. Hirtuleius died in the fighting.From the Gracchi to Nero, H. H. Scullard, p 91 however Philip Spann disagreed - Quintus Sertorius and the Legacy of Sulla, p110 During the Roman period the settlement belonged to one of numerous contemporary Latin convents. It is believed that the city was abandoned after the Islamic invasion of Spain centuries later. After the conquest of Toledo by Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile, the son of King Alfonso VI, Segovia was resettled with Christians from the north of the Iberian peninsula and beyond the Pyrenees, providing it with a significant sphere of influence whose boundaries crossed the Sierra de Guadarrama and the Tagus. Segovia's position on trading routes made it an important centre of trade in wool and textiles. The end of the Middle Ages saw something of a golden age for Segovia, with a growing Jewish population and the creation of a foundation for a powerful cloth industry. Several splendid works of Gothic architecture were also completed during this period. Notably, Isabella I was proclaimed queen of Castile in the church of San Miguel de Segovia on December 13, 1474. View of the Alc√°zar of Segovia (1838). Like most Castilian textile centres, Segovia joined the Revolt of the Comuneros under the command of Juan Bravo. Despite the defeat of the Communities, the city's resultant economic boom continued into the sixteenth century, its population rising to 27,000 in 1594. Then, as well as almost all the cities of Castile, Segovia entered a period of decline. Only a century later in 1694, the population had been reduced to only 8,000 inhabitants. In the early eighteenth century, Segovia attempted to revitalize its textile industry, with little success. In the second half of the century, Charles III made another attempt to revive the region's commerce; it took the form of the Royal Segovian Wool Manufacturing Company (1763). However, the lack of competitiveness of production caused the crown withdraw its sponsorship in 1779. In 1764, the Royal School of Artillery, the first military academy in Spain, was opened. This academy remains present in the city today. In 1808, Segovia was sacked by French troops during the War of Independence. During the First Carlist War, troops under the command of Don Carlos unsuccessfully attacked the city. During the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century, Segovia experienced a demographic recovery that was the result of relative economic stability. Demographics The population growth experienced during the nineteenth century accelerated steadily beginning around 1920: 16,013 inhabitants that year, 33,360 in 1960, 53,237 in 1981. Since the 1980s growth has slowed markedly: 55,586 in 2004 and 56,047 in 2007. Heritage =World Heritage City= In 1985 the old city of Segovia and its Aqueduct were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. The old city contains a multitude of historic buildings both civil and religious, including a large number of buildings of Jewish origin, notably within the old Jewish Quarter. One of the most historically important Jewish sites is the Jewish cemetery, . Among the most important monuments in the city are: *The Aqueduct of Segovia, located in Plaza del Azoguejo, is the defining historical feature of the city, dating from the late 1st or early 2nd century AD. Like a number of other aqueducts in Spain, Segovia's Roman-built aqueduct receives attention for being one of the ‚Äúextraordinary engineering accomplishments‚Äù existing in the country, wrote Alejandro Lapunzina in Reference Guides to National Architecture: Architecture of Spain. It is still used to deliver drinking water. ‚ÄúThe aqueduct of Segovia is ‚Äì because of its long span, architectural beauty, uncharacteristic slenderness, and dramatic presence in the center of a dense urban fabric ‚Äì the most impressive Roman structure in Spain, and one of the most famous among the numerous aqueducts built by the Romans throughout their vast Empire,‚Äù Lapunzina wrote.Lapunzina, A. (2005). Reference guides to national architecture: Architecture of Spain. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. It consists of about 25,000 granite blocks held together without any mortar, and spans 818 meters with more than 170 arches, the highest being 29 metres high. The Alc√°zar de Segovia. *The Alcazar of Segovia, the royal palace built on a stone peninsula between the rivers Eresma and Clamores, is documented for the first time in 1122, although it may have existed earlier. It was one of the favored residences of the kings of Castile, built in the transition from Romanesque architecture to Gothic and Mud√©jar. The building is structured around two courtyards and has two towers, and a keep. It was a favourite residence of Alfonso X the Wise and Henry IV, and Isabella the Catholic was crowned Queen of Castile in Segovia's Plaza Mayor. Devastated by a fire in 1862, it was later rebuilt. It now houses the General Militar de Segovia archive and museum of the Royal School of Artillery, managed by the Board of the Alcazar. Segovia Cathedral as seen from the Alcazar. *The Segovia Cathedral, the last Gothic cathedral built in Spain. It is considered a masterpiece of Basque-Castilian Gothic architecture and is known as \\"The Lady of Cathedrals.\\" Juan Gil de Honta√±√≥n, Rodrigo Gil de Honta√±√≥n, and other masters of Spanish architecture worked on the construction. It was consecrated in 1768 and is 105 meters long, 50 metres wide and 33 m high in the nave, has 18 chapels and has three doors: El Perd√≥n, San Frutos and San Geroteo. *The Walls of Segovia existed when Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile retook the city from the Arabs. Alfonso had them enlarged, and also increased its perimeter to 3 kilometres, with eight towers, five gates, and several doors. It was built mainly of granite blocks but also reused gravestones from the old Roman necropolis. The wall encircles the historic quarter and currently has three gates: San Cebri√°n; Santiago, built in the Mud√©jar style; and San Andr√©s, gateway to the Jewish quarter; and the breaches of Consuelo, San Juan, the Sun, and the Moon. =Religious architecture= Iglesia de San Esteban Old main synagogue View of the church of San Mill√°n de Segovia from Cervantes street  Churches and chapels  The city maintains an important collection of Romanesque churches of both stone and brick, which include the churches of San Esteban, San Mill√°n, San Mart√≠n, la Sant√≠sima Trinidad, San Andr√©s, San Clemente, Santos Justo y Pastor, la Vera Cruz, and San Salvador. The old main synagogue is a former synagogue, converted into a convent after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492.  Monasteries and convents  The city of Segovia preserved also several monasteries and convents with active religious life: * The Monastery of Saint Mary of Parral with the cloistered monks of the Order of Saint Jerome * The Monastery of the Humble Incarnation with the cloistered nuns of the Order of Saint Augustine * The Monastery of the Immaculate Conception with the cloistered Conceptionist nuns * The Monastery of San Vicente el Real with the cloistered nuns of the Cistercian Order * The Monastery of San Antonio el Real with the Poor Clare Sisters of the Order of Saint Claire * The Convent of Saint John of the Cross with the Discalced Carmelite friars * The Convent of Saint Joseph with the cloistered Discalced Carmelite nuns * The Convent of Corpus Christi with the Poor Clare Sisters of the Order of Saint Claire * The Convent of Santo Domingo el Real with the cloistered nuns of the Dominican Order * The Convent of Saint John of God with the Franciscan Sisters of the Third Order of Saint Francis =Civil architecture= * The Ayala Berganza Castilian Palace dates from the late 15th century. Due to a multiple murder that happened in the late 19th century is known by Segovia as \\"the house of the crime.\\" *Casa del Sello on San Francisco street *Casa-Museo del Torre√≥n de Lozoya in the Plaza de San Mart√≠n *Casa del Siglo XV (or of Juan Bravo) *House of the Count Alpuente, the Casa de los Picos and others in the Calle Real *La Taberna Rubi, the oldest tavern in the city *The Casa de la Moneda, a former mint included in the \\"production and manufacturing\\" theme of the European Route of Industrial Heritage. View of Segovia from Mirador de la canaleja. =Urban sculpture= Loba Capitolina at the foot of the aqueduct. Urban Sculpture in Segovia stars works depicting illustrious figures linked to the city, which wanted to pay tribute in this way, but we can also find several pictures of a religious nature. One of the most iconic sculptures of the Loba Capitolina sits in front of the aqueduct. A copy of the Capitoline wolf is preserved in the Capitoline Museum and was a gift that Rome gave to the city in 1974 during the events of the bimillennial anniversary of the aqueduct. Until a few decades ago, a monument dedicated to the artist Daniel Zuloaga which was installed in 1924, could be seen in the Plaza de la Merced, but it was relocated to the Plaza de Colmenares. Currently located in the center of the Plaza de la Merced, looking towards the church of San Andr√©s is a bust of the poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o, sculptor Santiago de Santiago, which was donated by the Nicaragua government to the city in 1973. Letters related to the bust are also found in the Promenade Lounge, the famous poet Jos√© Rodas was first installed in 1927 in the plaza of the gardens, and moved to its present site in 1960 by the segovian sculptor Aniceto Marinas. It could not miss this literary group a tribute to Antonio Machado, poet Segovia made his refuge from 1919 to 1932, the sculpture as it could be otherwise is located in the garden of his home museum, and was done by Emiliano Barral. Religious figures such as Domingo de Soto, Pius XII, Saint Anthony Mary Claret, Saint John of the Cross have their place within the city urban sculpture, the first work of Ortega and the rest of Jos√© Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Moro, sculptor prosperous Segovia who must also be a Monument to the Youth located in the Plaza del Conde de Cheste. Other teachers who also paid tribute to his work a few peasants have been both recognized in any street or town square, as is the case for Aniceto Marinas, who dedicated a monument in 1943 his friend and partner Mariano Benlliure. In the field of arms found the monument to Dao√≠z and Velarde, Aniceto Marinas work. By the same author is the List of people associated with the comunero Juan Bravo sculpture, made in 1921 and located in the heart of the city in the Square of the Sirens, the name given to two statues that top the stairs and representing these mythological beings, made by Francisco Bellver in 1852. Other sculptures in the city are devoted to medical Andr√©s Laguna made by the segovian Florentino Trapero and marina located in Plaza de los Huertos, the bust of Lope de la Calle Mart√≠n, president of the Provincial council that made Emiliano Barral and can be seen in the square of San Facundo or the monument \\"El Favorito\\", by Toribio Garc√≠a de Andr√©s in the early 20th century. In addition to this series of monuments and sculptures are hidden in the corners of the city some other religious images that are worth mentioning. The most significant of these is the Virgin of the Aqueduct, located in the central niche of the monument has since the Plaza del Azoguejo and it was already in the 16th century, as remember Colmenares in his history of Segovia. The cast of virgins are also members of the Fuencisla in Velarde street, the los Remedios in front of San Juan Gate, the Socorro at the San Andr√©s Gate or del Carmen on the street of its own name, among others. =Parks and gardens= Alcazar Gardens. Plaza de la Artiller√≠a * The Alcazar Gardens was built in the plaza where the Old Cathedral and the Episcopal Palace existed before and was created on the occasion of the marriage of Philip II to Anne of Austria in 1570, removing the ruins that still existed. This, however, was not fully realized until the visit of Ferdinand VI in the 18th century. Between 1816 and 1817 the first trees were planted, and enclosed with the fence that currently exists. They were destroyed by the fire suffered by the palace in 1862, and recovered again in 1882. * The Garden of la Merced was the first public garden carried out by the city within the city walls. Named after the former Mercy convent that was located in the same place and came into existence in the middle 19th century with the planting of trees and installation of a fountain, later replaced by the current, more broad and stately plaza. There is also a child's playground available. * Paseo del Sal√≥n is one of the oldest gardens in the city, since it was created in 1786 by the Economic Society of Friends of the Country of Segovia, and two years later they began planting trees. In 1846 he set up various sources and replanted again in different species. * Jardinillos of San Roque, situated along the so-called \\"Paseo Nuevo\\" were open to the public in 1872, but ten years before a public fountain was placed in them. In 1943 they were the place where stood a pavilion dedicated to the Feria de Muestras, the building still stands and is one of the characteristic features of the gardens. *Missionaries, The Garden of los Ca√±uelos * The Gardens of los Huertos are named for the orchards occupy a premonstratensian friary. After the removal of the convent in 1836 with the first disentailment laws, the city claimed ownership of the land, a fact that occurred in 1897. In 1901 he began planting trees and structuring of the gardens, which has gradually been restored today. * Alameda del Eresma * Alameda de la Fuencisla * Fromkes Garden * Garden of la Plaza del Conde Alpuente * Garden of la Plaza de Colmenares * Garden of St. Augustine * Parque de la Albuera * Parque de la Dehesa * Pinarillo de la Cuesta de los Hoyos * Clamores Valley Economy The economy of Segovia revolves around metallurgy, agriculture, furniture, construction and, particularly, tourism. The town itself plays host to thousands of day-visitors from Madrid each year due to its popular attractions. Transport Segovia is served by the Autopista AP-61 which opened in 2004. Segovia-Guiomar railway station provides a rail connection to Madrid Chamart√≠n and Valladolid-Campo Grande via the AVE network's Madrid‚ÄìLe√≥n high-speed rail line. Education The city of Segovia is home to a large number of primary schools and secondary schools, the oldest of which (IES Mariano Quintanilla, founded in 1845) having been officially declared \\"of cultural interest.\\" A high proportion of the student population attends state primary and secondary schools, while private schooling in Segovia is mostly religious in nature. Regarding higher education, Segovia's premier institution is IE University, a business-oriented undergraduate university, building upon Instituto Empresa's successful MBA program at Madrid-based IE Business School. Also present is the Segovia campus of the University of Valladolid, offering entrance into careers in computer engineering, law, journalism, advertising and teaching.

At Mid-morning the Carol of San Frutos is sung in the Cathedral, after which there are often various activities in the Plaza Mayor, as a proclamation, a concert by the Band of the Segovian Musical Union, mycology exhibition, etc. In recent years, following the established tradition of drawn traditions of the sleeve, Segovia's pastry chefs have invented a dessert of the saint. On the last night to San Frutos the segovian congregate at the image of the saint who is at the door of the Cathedral to see him turning the page of the book that she holds. * Virgin of the Fuencisla (September 25): Patronenss of Segovia. The biggest celebration day takes place during the last Sunday of the month. Two Thursdays before the Virgin up from his sanctuary in the Alameda of the Fuencisla to the Cathedral to start the novena (his arrival at the Plaza Mayor is one of the most specific one can be found in Segovia, is typical to make it when the clock of the Town Hall rings).

Many professional classical guitarists today were students of Segovia, or students of his students. Segovia's contribution to the modern-romantic repertoire not only included commissions but also his own transcriptions of classical or baroque works. He is remembered for his expressive performances: his wide palette of tone, and his distinctive musical personality, phrasing and style.  Early life  Segovia was born on 21 February 1893 in Linares, Ja√©n, Spain. He was sent at a very young age to live with his uncle Eduardo and aunt Mar√≠a. Eduardo arranged for Segovia's first music lessons with a violin teacher after recognizing that Segovia had an aptitude for music. This proved to be an unhappy introduction to music for the young Segovia because of the teacher's strict methods, and Eduardo stopped the lessons. His uncle decided to move to Granada to allow Segovia to obtain a better education; after arriving in Granada, Segovia recommenced his musical studies. Segovia was aware of flamenco during his formative years as a musician but stated that he \\"did not have a taste\\" for the form and chose instead the works of Fernando Sor, Francisco T√°rrega, and other classical composers.Secrets From The Masters (Edited by Don Menn) ‚Äì (Published by GPI Books) () ‚Äì p237 Segovia quote: \\"....I did not have a taste for the flamenco. My friends began to look in private houses and in music shops for something written for the guitar. And they found something by Sor, Giuliani, Aguado, and little things published by Tarrega.\\". T√°rrega agreed to give the self-taught Segovia some lessons but died before they could meet, and Segovia states that his early musical education involved the \\"double function of professor and pupil in the same body\\".Secrets From The Masters (Edited by Don Menn) ‚Äì (Published by GPI Books) ()  Career  Segovia's first public performance was in GranadaSecrets From The Masters (Edited by Don Menn) ‚Äì (Published by GPI Books) () ‚Äì p238 Segovia quote: \\"The first concert I gave was in Granada. Then I had to give it in Seville about two months later.\\" at the age of 16 in 1909. A few years later he played his first professional concert in Madrid, which included works by Francisco T√°rrega and his own guitar transcriptions of Johann Sebastian Bach. Despite the discouragement of his family, who wanted him to become a lawyer, and criticism by some of T√°rrega's pupils for his idiosyncratic technique,In Memory of Andres Segovia ; by Vasilios Avraam he continued to pursue his studies of the guitar diligently. He played again in Madrid in 1912, at the Paris Conservatory in 1915, in Barcelona in 1916, and made a successful tour of South America in 1919. Segovia's arrival on the international stage coincided with a time when the guitar's fortunes as a concert instrument were being revived, largely through the efforts of Miguel Llobet.Phillips, Robert Michael, \\"The influence of Miguel Llobet on the pedagogy, repertoire, and stature of the guitar in the twentieth century\\" (2002). It was in this changing milieu that Segovia, thanks to his strength of personality and artistry, coupled with developments in recording and broadcasting, succeeded in making the guitar more popular again. In 1921 in Paris, Segovia met Alexandre Tansman, who later wrote a number of guitar works for Segovia, among them Cavatina, which won a prize at the Siena International Composition contest in 1952. At Granada in 1922 he became associated with the Concurso de Cante Jondo promoted by the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla. The aim of the \\"classicizing\\" Concurso was to preserve flamenco in its purity from being distorted by modern popular music.Carol A. Hess, Manuel de Falla and modernism in Spain, 1898‚Äì1936 (University of Chicago 2001) at 175. Segovia had already developed as a fine tocador of flamenco guitar, yet his direction was now classical.D. E. Pohlen, Lives and Legends of Flamenco (Madrid 1964, revised 1988) at 73. Invited to open the Concurso held at the Alhambra, he played Homenaje a Debussy by Falla.Eduardo Molina Fajardo, Manuel de Falla y El \\"Cante Jondo\\" (Universidad de Granada 1962; 2d ed. 1998) at 116.

Housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1923 Segovia visited Mexico for the first time. There Manuel Ponce was so impressed with the concert that he wrote a review in El Universal.Manuel M. Ponce and the guitar By Coraz√≥n Otero, J. D. Roberts; Bold Strummer, 1994; Later Ponce went on to write many works for Segovia, including numerous sonatas. In 1924, Segovia visited the German luthier Hermann Hauser Sr. after hearing some of his instruments played in a concert in Munich. In 1928 Hauser provided Segovia with one of the guitars which he used during his tour of the United States and in other concerts up to 1933. Segovia ordered a further guitar from Hauser and after receiving it passed on the 1928 model to his US representative and close friend Sophocles Papas, who in his turn gave it to his student, the famous jazz and classical guitarist Charlie Byrd, who used it on several records. Segovia's first American tour was arranged in 1928 when Fritz Kreisler, the Viennese violinist who privately played the guitar, persuaded Francis Charles Coppicus from the Metropolitan Musical Bureau to present the guitarist in New York.Andres Segovia Is Dead At 94; His Crusade Elevated Guitar; by Donal Henahan; The New York Times; 4 June 1987Andres Segovia, Spanish Guitarist ; Biography; hosted at Cumpiano.com After Segovia's debut tour in the US in 1928 the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos composed his now well-known Twelve √âtudes (Portuguese: Doze estudos; French: Douze √©tudes; German: Zw√∂lf Studien) and later dedicated them to Segovia. Their relationship proved to be lasting and Villa-Lobos continued to write for Segovia. He also transcribed numerous classical pieces himself and revived the pieces transcribed by predecessors like T√°rrega. Segovia at a recital in the \\"Concerts Ysaye\\" in Brussels, 15 December 1932 (Hilda Wiener, 18771940) In 1932, Segovia met and befriended composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco in Venice. Since Castelnuovo-Tedesco did not play the guitar, Segovia provided him with guitar compositions (Ponce's Folias variations and Sor's Mozart Variations) which he could study. Castelnuovo-Tedesco composed a large number of works for the guitar, many of them dedicated to Segovia. The Concerto Op. 99 of 1939 was the first guitar concerto of the 20th century and Castelnuovo-Tedesco's last work in Italy, before he emigrated to the United States. It was premiered by Segovia in Uruguay in 1939. In 1935, he gave his first public performance of Bach's Chaconne, a difficult piece for any instrument. He moved to Montevideo, performing many concerts in South America in the thirties and early forties. After World War II, Segovia began to record more frequently and performed regular tours of Europe and the US, a schedule he would maintain for the next thirty years. In 1954, Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo dedicated Fantas√≠a para un gentilhombre (Fantasy for a Gentleman) to Segovia. Segovia won the 1958 Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance, Instrumentalist for his recording Segovia Golden Jubilee.Segovia at Grammy.com John W. Duarte dedicated his English Suite Op. 31 to Segovia and his wife (Emilia Magdalena del Corral Sancho) on the occasion of their marriage in 1962. Segovia told the composer \\"You will be astonished at the success it will have\\".Few words from the composer, John Duarte; Goni website In recognition of his contributions to music and the arts, Segovia was ennobled on 24 June 1981 by King Juan Carlos I, who gave Segovia the hereditary title of Marqu√©s de Salobre√±a (English: Marquis of Salobre√±a) in the nobility of Spain. Segovia continued performing into his old age, living in semi-retirement during his 70s and 80s on the Costa del Sol. Two films were made of his life and work‚Äîone when he was 75 and the other 84. They are available on DVD under the titles Andr√©s Segovia‚Äîin Portrait. His final RCA LP (ARL1-1602), Reveries, was recorded in Madrid in June 1977. In 1984, Segovia was the subject of a 13-part series broadcast on National Public Radio, entitled Segovia! The series was recorded on location in Spain, France and the United States. Hosted by Oscar Brand the series was produced by Jim Anderson, Robert Malesky, and Larry Snitzler. Segovia died on 2 June 1987 in Madrid of a heart attack at the age of 94. He is buried at Casa Museo de Linares, in Andalusia.  Technique  The right hand is responsible for the guitar's musical sound, so when examining technique, the way the right hand is placed in relation to the strings is most important. For several years, it was thought among the guitar community that Segovia plucked the strings with a combination of fingertip and nail (as stated by Christopher Parkening), but Segovia plucked the strings only with the nails. When asked which technique he used, he replied: \\"the only one there is: nails. Because they bring timbre differences and colour variation and give sonorous volume to the guitar.\\" His right hand was placed so that the nails were perpendicular to the strings. In this way the nail alone would press the string. At the same time, it was thought that this was the only way to avoid unpleasant noise coming from the low strings (E, A and D) of the guitar when plucked. Segovia created a strong bass sound with his right thumb in spite of his technique. This was largely due to the flexibility he had in his thumb which helped to create a very strong and voluminous sound in the bass notes. Another innovation that separated Segovia from the Tarrega school was the search for the tension in the strings by placing his right hand further to the right side. In this way, he could not only obtain colour variation but an especially strong, round and voluminous sound, something very helpful for giving concerts in big halls (this technique was later used by Narciso Yepes). Before Segovia, guitarists from the Tarrega school, played the guitar by putting the hand right in the soundhole of the instrument, thus creating a mellow sound, but not capable to fill the whole space of a big concert hall. After World War II, Segovia became among the first to endorse nylon strings instead of catgut strings.Augustine Strings; see history This advance allowed for greater tonal stability and was the final ingredient in the standardization of the instrument.  Repertoire  Segovia's repertoire consisted of three principal pillars: first, contemporary works, including concertos and sonatas, usually specifically written for Segovia himself by composers with whom he forged working relationships, notably Spaniards such as Federico Moreno Torroba, Federico Mompou, and Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo, the Mexican composer Manuel Ponce, the Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and the great Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos; second, transcriptions, usually made by Segovia himself,Julian Bream (A Life on the Road) by Tony Palmer (First Published in the UK by Macdonald & Co 1982) () p125 \\"...the composer Peter Warlock.....persuaded the Oxford University Press to publish his edition of Dowland's Lachrimae or Seven Tears, and this was the edition Segovia used for his guitar transcriptions.\\" of classical works originally written for other instruments (e.g., lute, harpsichord, piano, violin, cello) by Johann Sebastian Bach, Isaac Alb√©niz, Enrique Granados, and many other prominent composers; third, traditional classical guitar works by composers such as Fernando Sor and Francisco T√°rrega. Segovia's influence enlarged the repertoire, mainly as a commissioner or dedicatee of new works, as a transcriber, and to a far lesser extent as a composerAndr√©s Segovia's compositions ; Pocci Catalog (see also) with such works as his Estudio sin luz. Segovia (1962) Segovia's main musical aesthetic preferences were music of the early 20th century (and turn of the century) especially in the Spanish romantic-modern and nationalist style. This is perhaps best typified by Segovia's own work Estudio sin Luz. Many works of this and similar style were written especially for him and formed part of his core repertoire: particularly the guitar works of Federico Moreno Torroba (1891‚Äì1982), such as the Sonatina, which was first performed by Segovia in Paris in 1925. Segovia was selective and only performed works with which he identified personally. He was known to reject atonal works, or works which he considered too radical, even if they were dedicated to him; e.g. he rejected Frank Martin's Quatre pi√®ces br√®ves, Darius Milhaud's Segoviana, etc.Britishness and the classical guitar after 1950: composers, performers and identity in the contemporary British guitar repertoire by Mark Marrington Even though rejected by Segovia, the works are today all published and available.Frank Martin: Quatre pi√®ces br√®ves; Universal EditionDarius Milhaud: Segoviana; √âditions Alphonse LeducBook Review: The Andres Segovia Archive, edited by Angelo Gilardino, Liugi Biscaldi by Silvio Jose dos SantosAndr√©s Segovia Archive at B√®rben = Teaching = Segovia viewed teaching as vital to his mission of propagating the guitar and gave master classes throughout his career. His most famous master classes took place at M√∫sica en Compostela in the northern Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela. Segovia also taught at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena for numerous years, where he was aided by Alirio D√≠az.The Guitar from the Renaissance to the Present Day by Harvey Turnbull; Bold Strummer, 1992; Later it was Oscar Ghiglia who continued the Siena class. His teaching style is a source of controversy among some of his former students, who considered it to be dogmatically authoritarian. One of Segovia's most celebrated former students of the classical guitar, John Williams, has said that Segovia bullied students into playing only his style, stifling the development of their own styles. Williams has also said that Segovia was dismissive of music that did not have what Segovia considered the right classical origins, such as South American music with popular roots. = Legacy = Segovia can be considered a catalytic figure in granting respectability to the guitar as a serious concert instrument capable of evocativeness and depth of interpretation. It was Federico Moreno Torroba who said: \\"The musical interpreter who fascinates me the most is Andr√©s Segovia\\".ABC Madrid; 1975/10/12; translated from the Spanish: \\"El int√©rprete musical que m√°s me fascina es Andr√©s Segovia\\" He can be credited to have dignified the classical guitar as a legitimate concert instrument before the discerning music public, which had hitherto viewed the guitar merely as a limited, if sonorous, parlor instrument. In Linares the Segovia Museum \\"Fundaci√≥n Andr√©s Segovia\\" was established in May 1995, and Linares (Segovia's birthplace) also has a bronze statue in his honour, created by Julio L√≥pez Hern√°ndez and unveiled on 25 May 1984.statue A Concise History of the Classic Guitar by Graham Wade; Mel Bay Publications, 2001; Visita a la Fundaci√≥n Andr√©s Segovia; Artepulsado Segovia influenced a generation of classical guitarists who built on his technique and musical sensibility, including such luminaries as Christopher Parkening, Julian Bream, John Williams and Oscar Ghiglia, all of whom have acknowledged their debt to him. Further, Segovia left behind a large body of edited works and transcriptions for classical guitar, including several transcriptions of Bach‚Äîin particular, an extraordinarily demanding classical guitar transcription of the Chaconne from the 2nd Partita for Violin (BWV 1004). During his lifetime, guitarists were eager to claim association with Segovia, and Segovia himself suggested that he had not actually taught as many students as has been claimed; he once said, \\"All over the world I have 'pupils' I have never met.\\"Duarte, John W. Andres Segovia As I Knew Him. Pacific, MO: Mel Bay, 1998. p. 5 His editions of works originally written for guitar include newly fingered and occasionally revised versions of works from the standard repertoire (most famously, his edition of a selection of twenty estudios by Fernando Sor, the \\"cornerstone\\" of every serious student's technique since its publication in 1945, although somewhat ironically Segovia in the preface to that work disparaged Sor as \\"not among the vigorous talents\\") as well as compositions written for him, including by Heitor Villa-Lobos, Federico Mompou, and Mario Castelnuovo- Tedesco. Many of the latter were edited by Segovia, working in collaboration with the composer, before they were first published. Because of Segovia's predilection for altering the musical content of his editions to reflect his interpretive preferences, many of today's guitarists prefer to examine the original manuscripts, or newer publications based on the original manuscripts in order to compare them with Segovia's published versions, so as to accept or reject Segovia's editorial decisions. Segovia was one of those to whom homage was paid in the 1978 song by Ian Dury and The Blockheads \\"There Ain't Half Been Some Clever Bastards\\". Influential rock entertainer Johnny Thunders included a guitar instrumental titled \\"Illegitimate Son of Segovia\\" in his album Hurt me.  Namings  * The main-belt asteroid 3822 Segovia was named in his memory in 1989. * A competition co-sponsored by the European Guitar Teachers Association is named after Segovia.  Awards  Segovia was awarded many prizes and honours, including doctorates honoris causa, from ten universities. On 24 June 1981, he was ennobled by King Juan Carlos I, who gave Segovia the hereditary title of Marqu√©s de Salobre√±a (English: Marquis of Salobre√±a) in the nobility of Spain in recognition of his contributions to music and the arts. He received the Danish Sonning Award in 1974, the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1985, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1986.  Personal life  Segovia's first wife was Adelaida Portillo (marriage in 1918).Family image: Segovia with wife Adelaida Portillo and baby ; Nuevo Mundo (Madrid), 5 May 1922 Segovia's second wife (marriage in 1935) was the pianist Paquita Madriguera, who also made some piano roll recordings. From 1944, he maintained a relationship with Brazilian singer and guitarist , which was to last for over a decade. In 1962 Segovia married Emilia Magdalena Corral Sancho.

Walt Disney's Story of Pluto The Pup. Whitman BLB, 1938. is a fictional dog created in 1930 at Walt Disney Productions. He is a yellow-orange color, medium-sized, short-haired dog with black ears. Unlike most Disney characters, Pluto is not anthropomorphic beyond some characteristics such as facial expression.Farrell, Ken. Warman's Disney Collectibles Field Guide: Values and Identification. Iola, WI: Krause Publications, 2011. p. 308. He is Mickey Mouse's pet. Officially a mixed-breed dog, he made his debut as a bloodhound in the Mickey Mouse cartoon The Chain Gang.Smith, Dave. Disney A to Z: The Updated Official Encyclopedia. New York: Hyperion, 1998. Print. . Together with Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, and Goofy, Pluto is one of the \\"Sensational Six\\"‚Äîthe biggest stars in the Disney universe.Stewart, James B. Disney War. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005. p. 5. Though all six are non-human animals, Pluto alone is not dressed as a human.Griffin, Sean. Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out. New York: New York UP, 2000. p. 70. Pluto debuted in animated cartoons and appeared in 24 Mickey Mouse films before receiving his own series in 1937. All together Pluto appeared in 89 short films between 1930 and 1953. Several of these were nominated for an Academy Award, including The Pointer (1939), Squatter's Rights (1946), Pluto's Blue Note (1947), and Mickey and the Seal (1948). One of his films, Lend a Paw (1941), won the award in 1942. Because Pluto does not speak, his films generally rely on physical humor. This made Pluto a pioneering figure in character animation, by expressing personality through animation rather than dialogue.\\"The Flypaper Sequence Mystery,\\" essay by Michael Barrier Like all of Pluto's co-stars, the dog has appeared extensively in comics over the years, first making an appearance in 1931.Pluto at INDUCKS He returned to theatrical animation in 1990 with The Prince and the Pauper and has also appeared in several direct-to-video films. Pluto also appears in the television series Mickey Mouse Works (1999‚Äì2000), House of Mouse (2001‚Äì2003), Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006‚Äì2016), and the new Mickey Mouse shorts (2013‚Äìpresent). In 1998, Disney's copyright on Pluto, set to expire in 2003, was extended by the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. Disney, along with other studios, lobbied for passage of the act to preserve their copyrights on characters such as Pluto for 20 additional years.Sprigman, Chris. FindLaw's Writ, March 5, 2002, \\"THE MOUSE THAT ATE THE PUBLIC DOMAIN: Disney, The Copyright Term Extension Act, And eldred V. Ashcroft \\". Accessed September 19, 2012. Origin Pluto first appeared as a nameless bloodhound tracking the escaped convict Mickey in the film The Chain Gang (September 1930).Watts, Steven. The Magic Kingdom: Walt Disney and the American Way of Life. Columbia, MO: U of Missouri, 2001. p. 132. A month and a half later, in The Picnic, Pluto appeared as Minnie Mouse's dog named Rover who comes along with her and Mickey on a picnic. By his third appearance, in The Moose Hunt (1931), Pluto is Mickey's pet, today named \\"Pluto\\".Smith, Dave. Disney Trivia from the Vault: Secrets Revealed and Questions Answered. New York: Disney Editions, 2012. Several months had passed between the naming of what was then classified as the ninth planet, Pluto, on March 24, 1930, and the attachment of that name to the dog character. Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen said \\"We thought the name [Rover] was too common, so we had to look for something else. ... We changed it to Pluto the Pup ... but I don't honestly remember why.\\" Disney says they have no documents to support or refute the connection.Weintraub, David A. Nature 444, December 21, 2006, \\"BOOK REVIEWED-Is Pluto a Planet? A Historical Journey Through the Solar System\\", pp 1006-1007, . Unofficially, even Disney's animators believed that Walt Disney chose the name to capitalize on the sensation of the newly named planet.Boyle, Alan. The Case for Pluto: How a Little Planet Made a Big Difference. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2009. p. 49. Pluto was initially a minor character until 1934 when Disney animator Norm Ferguson gave the dog a key role in the cartoon Playful Pluto. Pluto becomes entangled with a sticky piece of flypaper, and Ferguson expanded the sequence significantly. The segment became a classic, demonstrating how Disney artists can take a simple circumstance and build humor through a character.Finch, Christopher, pages 71, 74, 91, 106, 111, and 230. The Art of Walt Disney, 2004 Characterization Playful Pluto (1934); Pluto struggles with a piece of flypaper Unlike Mickey's other animal friends, such as Goofy (who is also a dog), Pluto is a relatively normal animal, with few anthropomorphic traits apart from his facial expressions. Pluto usually does not speak in English, walk upright, or wear clothing. A significant departure from this was his speaking role in The Moose Hunt (1931), which was produced before Pluto's characterization had been clearly defined. As Pluto made more appearances, it became common that he would mostly speak in barks and grunts like most dogs. Other ways of communicating Pluto's thoughts occur through his facial expressions, and sometimes through the use of a shoulder angel/devil who speak directly to Pluto. (Mickey's Elephant, Lend a Paw). Pluto is generally a cheerful and adventurous dog, although he can be given to sheer panic when confronted with something unknown. Common themes in Pluto's stories involve him becoming jealous of Mickey getting another pet (Mickey's Elephant, Lend a Paw, Mickey and the Seal), Pluto accidentally and unwittingly swallowing something and panicking when he realizes it (Playful Pluto, Donald and Pluto), Pluto getting entangled with something inanimate, or Pluto being pestered by a smaller animal (Private Pluto, Squatter's Rights). In many of his appearances with Mickey, Pluto will get himself into trouble and cause Mickey to get angry at him. Mickey, however, often cheers up quickly; often telling Pluto \\"I can't be mad at ya.\\" Pluto sometimes appears with other regular animal characters. His friends include Fifi the Peke, Dinah the Dachshund, and Ronnie the St. Bernard Puppy. Other animals he is less friendly with include Salty the Seal, Butch the Bulldog, Figaro the Kitten, Chip 'n Dale, Spike the Bee, Bent-Tail the Coyote, Milton the cat and other characters. In Disney's 1937 animated short Pluto's Quin-Puplets, Pluto has a son who is simply referred to as \\"Pluto Junior.\\" In the 1946 animated short Pluto's Kid Brother, Pluto has a younger brother named K.B. Appearances Bone Trouble (1940); Butch the Bulldog is a common antagonist of Pluto Pluto first and most often appears in the Mickey Mouse series of cartoons. On rare occasions, he is paired with Donald Duck (\\"Donald and Pluto\\", \\"Beach Picnic\\", \\"Window Cleaners\\", \\"The Eyes Have It\\", \\"Donald's Dog Laundry\\", & \\"Put Put Troubles\\"). The first cartoons to feature Pluto as a solo star were two Silly Symphony shorts, Just Dogs (1932) and Mother Pluto (1936). In 1937, Pluto appeared in Pluto's Quin-Puplets which was the first installment of his own film series, then headlined Pluto the Pup. However, they were not produced on a regular basis until 1940, by which time the name of the series was shortened to Pluto. His first comics appearance was in the Mickey Mouse comic strip in July 1931, two months after the release of The Moose Hunt. In 1938, Pluto headlined in the Silly Symphony Sunday comic strip, in an adaptation of his Silly Symphony short, Mother Pluto. Pluto was later featured in several sequences of the Silly Symphony strip in 1939 and 1940. Pluto Saves the Ship, a comic book published in 1942, was one of the first Disney comics prepared for publication outside newspaper strips. However, not counting a few cereal giveaway mini-comics in 1947 and 1951, he did not have his own comics title until 1952. In 1936, Pluto was featured in the picture book Mickey Mouse and Pluto the Pup by Whitman Publishing. Pluto runs his own neighborhood in Disney's Toontown Online. It's called the Brrrgh and it's always snowing there except during Halloween. During April Toons Week, a weekly event that is very silly, Pluto switches playgrounds with Minnie (all other characters do this as well). Pluto actually talks in Minnie's Melodyland. Pluto has also appeared in the television series Mickey Mouse Works (1999‚Äì2000), Disney's House of Mouse (2001‚Äì2002), Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006‚Äì2016), the new Mickey Mouse shorts ( 2013‚Äìpresent), and Mickey & the Roadster Racers (2017‚Äìpresent). Curiously enough, however, Pluto was the only standard Disney character not included when the whole gang was reunited for the 1983 featurette Mickey's Christmas Carol, although he did return in The Prince and the Pauper (1990) and Runaway Brain (1995). He also had a cameo at the ending of Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). In 1996, he made a cameo in the Quack Pack episode \\"The Really Mighty Ducks\\". =Short films= The following is a list of short films starring Pluto in the Pluto the Pup and Pluto series.

Pluto also appears in Disney Golf for the PS2. In the event that the player's golf ball goes out of bounds or hits a water hazard, Pluto will come and look for your golf ball. In the Kingdom Hearts video game series, Pluto is still Mickey's pet and acts as somewhat of a messenger, assisting in his master's plans. For most of Kingdom Hearts II, Pluto stays by Kairi's side (even when she has been kidnapped), as he has apparently taken a liking to her. Strangely, throughout the series, Pluto appears and disappears at random moments. =Disney parks= In the various Disney theme park resorts around the world, Pluto is a meetable character just like many of his film co- stars.http://www.charactercentral.net/C36_DisneyCharacters_MickeyFriends_Pluto.aspx Pluto, however, uncharacteristically walks on two legs in this capacity out of necessity. Adults and children are able to meet, play with, and get autographs and pictures with Pluto and his friends at all Disney parks. Confusion concerning Pluto and Goofy Disney has dealt with a certain amount of confusion concerning the fact that Pluto (an ordinary dog) is treated as a household pet while the anthropomorphic Goofy is treated as a human despite being of the same species. On their web site, it stated that \\"Goofy was originally created as Dippy Dawg\\" and \\"was created as a human character, as opposed to Pluto who was a pet, so [Goofy] walked upright and had a speaking voice\\". This problem was humorously illustrated in the film Stand By Me in which one of the boys ponders, \\"Mickey's a mouse, Donald's a duck, and Pluto's a dog. What's Goofy?\\" Also in the series Funniest Pets & People a dog \\"mentions\\" why couldn't he have pants because Goofy was a dog and had pants. There is also an episode of the Disney Channel series Even Stevens called \\"Scrub Day\\" wherein Louis' rallying-the-troops speech he wonders why Goofy got to walk and talk and Pluto has to eat from a dog bowl. This confusion is also mentioned in the French movie La Cit√© de la peur. In the Disney's Toontown Online event \\"April Toons Week,\\" characters switch playgrounds and everything is silly. Pluto switches places with Minnie Mouse, and he speaks. A brief gag in an episode of House of Mouse also acknowledges this. Hades asks Goofy, \\"Are you a man, are you a dog, are you a man-dog . . . what are you?\\". Goofy simply replies, \\"I'm just Goofy.\\" The confusion between Goofy and Pluto are also mentioned in an episode of Full House by Dave Coulier's character, Joey. Tina Fey used the term \\"Goofy Pluto\\" to refer to seemingly disparate roles for guest stars on 30 Rock, namely the mismatch between Jennifer Aniston playing a character in the show in the same episode in which the cast of Night Court appears as themselves in the episode titled \\"The One with the Cast of Night Court.\\" Notes References External links  Pluto on IMDb Category:Disney comics characters Category:Disney core universe characters Category:Fictional characters from Calisota Category:Film characters introduced in 1930 Category:Fictional dogs Category:Male characters in animation Category:Kingdom Hearts characters ","title":"Pluto (Disney)"},{"id":"71935","text":"Educational settings as place and/or subject in fiction form the theme of this catalogue of titles and authors.

Cultivars of the plant produce fruits in different colours, including red, yellow, orange, green, white, and purple. Bell peppers are sometimes grouped with less pungent pepper varieties as \\"sweet peppers\\". While they are fruits‚Äîbotanically classified as berries‚Äîthey are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish. Peppers are native to Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. Pepper seeds were imported to Spain in 1493 and then spread through Europe and Asia. The mild bell pepper cultivar was developed in the 1920s, in Szeged, Hungary. Preferred growing conditions for bell peppers include warm, moist soil in a temperature range of . Nomenclature The name pepper was given by Europeans when Christopher Columbus brought the plant back to Europe. At that time, black pepper (peppercorns), from the unrelated plant Piper nigrum originating from India, was a highly prized condiment. The name pepper was applied in Europe to all known spices with a hot and pungent taste and was therefore extended to genus Capsicum when it was introduced from the Americas. The most commonly used name of the plant family, chile, is of Mexican origin, from the Nahuatl word chilli. The terms bell pepper (US, Canada, Philippines), pepper or sweet pepper (UK, Ireland), and capsicum (Australia, India, New Zealand, Malaysia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) are often used for any of the large bell-shaped peppers, regardless of their color. The vegetable is simply referred to as a \\"pepper\\", or additionally by color (\\"green pepper\\" or red, yellow, orange, purple, brown, black). In the Midland region of the U.S., bell peppers when stuffed and pickled are sometimes called mangoes. In some languages, the term paprika, which has its roots in the word for pepper, is used for both the spice and the fruit - sometimes referred to by their colour (for example groene paprika, gele paprika, in Dutch, which are green and yellow, respectively). The bell pepper is called \\"„Éë„Éó„É™„Ç´\\" (papurika) or \\"„Éî„Éº„Éû„É≥\\" (piiman, from Portuguese piment√£o) in Japan. In Switzerland, the fruit is mostly called peperone, which is the Italian name of the fruit. In France, it is called poivron, with the same root as poivre (meaning \\"pepper\\") or piment. In Spain it is called pimiento, the masculine form of the traditional spice, pimienta. In South Korea, the word \\"ÌîºÎßù\\" (pimang from the French piment) refers to green bell peppers, whereas \\"ÌååÌîÑÎ¶¨Ïπ¥\\" (papeurika, from paprika) refers to bell peppers of other colors. In Sri Lanka, both the bell pepper and the banana pepper are referred to as a \\"capsicum\\" since the bell pepper has no Sinhalese translation. Colors A variety of colored bell peppers The most common colors of bell peppers are green, yellow, orange and red. More rarely, brown, white, lavender, and dark purple peppers can be seen, depending on the variety. Most typically, unripe fruits are green or, less commonly, pale yellow or purple. Red bell peppers are simply ripened green peppers, although the Permagreen variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe. As such, mixed colored peppers also exist during parts of the ripening process. Use as a food Chef chopping bell peppers Like the tomato, bell peppers are botanical fruits but culinary vegetables. Pieces of bell pepper are commonly used in garden salads and as toppings on pizza or cheesesteaks. There are many varieties of stuffed peppers prepared using hollowed or halved bell peppers. Bell peppers (and other cultivars of Capsicum annuum) may be used in the production of the spice paprika. Bell peppers are 94% water, 5% carbohydrates, and negligible fat and protein (table). They are rich sources of vitamin C, containing 97% of the Daily Value (DV) in a 100 gram reference amount (table). Their vitamin B6 content is moderate (17% DV), with no other micronutrients present in significant amounts (table). Red bell peppers have approximately twice the vitamin C and eight times the vitamin A content than green bell peppers. The bell pepper is the only member of the genus Capsicum that does not produce capsaicin, a lipophilic chemical that can cause a strong burning sensation when it comes in contact with mucous membranes. They are thus scored in the lowest level of the Scoville scale. This absence of capsaicin is due to a recessive form of a gene that eliminates the compound and, consequently, the \\"hot\\" taste usually associated with the rest of the genus Capsicum. This recessive gene is overwritten in the Mexibelle pepper, a hybrid variety of bell pepper that produces small amounts of capsaicin (and is thus mildly pungent). Sweet pepper cultivars produce non- pungent capsaicinoids.  Production  China is the world's largest producer of bell and chile peppers, followed by Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, and the United States of America.

It is named for its visual resemblance in shape and ‚Äì for the red variety ‚Äì colour to a human kidney. Red kidney beans should not be confused with other red beans, such as adzuki beans. Classification There are different classifications of kidney beans, such as: *Red kidney bean (also known as: common kidney bean, rajma in India, surkh (red) lobia in Pakistan). *Light speckled kidney bean (and long shape light speckled kidney bean). *Red speckled kidney bean (and long shape light speckled kidney bean). *White kidney bean (also known as cannellini in Italy, lobia in India, or safaid (white) lobia in Pakistan). Nutrition Kidney beans cooked by boiling are 67% water, 23% carbohydrates, 9% protein, and contain negligible fat (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, cooked kidney beans provide , and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, folate (33% DV), iron (22% DV), and phosphorus (20% DV), with moderate amounts (10-19% DV) of thiamin, copper, magnesium, and zinc (11-14% DV). Dishes Rajma served with rice - a common dish in north India. Red kidney beans are commonly used in chili con carne and are used in the cuisine of India, where the beans are known as rajma. Red kidney beans are used in southern Louisiana for the classic Monday Creole dish of red beans and rice. The smaller, darker red beans are also used, particularly in Louisiana families with a recent Caribbean heritage. Small kidney beans used in La Rioja, Spain, are called caparrones. In the Netherlands and Indonesia, kidney beans are usually served as soup called brenebon. In the Levant a common dish consisting of kidney bean stew usually served with rice is known as fasoulia. To make bean paste, kidney beans are generally prepared from dried beans and boiling until they are soft, at which point the dark red beans are pulverized into a dry paste. Toxicity Red kidney beans contain relatively high amounts of phytohemagglutinin, and thus are more toxic than most other bean varieties if not pre-soaked and subsequently heated to the boiling point for at least 10 minutes. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature long enough to completely destroy the toxin. Cooking at the lower temperature of , such as in a slow cooker, can increase this danger and raise the toxin concentration up to fivefold.Phytohaemagglutinin.

At its inception it had only 11 students and the offices was located at Rue du Valentin in Lausanne. In 1869, it became the technical department of the public Acad√©mie de Lausanne. When the Acad√©mie was reorganised and acquired the status of a university in 1890, the technical faculty changed its name to √âcole d'ing√©nieurs de l'Universit√© de Lausanne. In 1946, it was renamed the √âcole polytechnique de l'Universit√© de Lausanne (EPUL). In 1969, the EPUL was separated from the rest of the University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name. EPFL, like ETH Zurich, is thus directly controlled by the Swiss federal government. In contrast, all other universities in Switzerland are controlled by their respective cantonal governments. Following the nomination of Patrick Aebischer as president in 2000, EPFL has started to develop into the field of life sciences. It absorbed the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) in 2008. In 1946, there were 360 students. In 1969, EPFL had 1,400 students and 55 professors. In the past two decades the university has grown rapidly and as of 2012 roughly 14,000 people study or work on campus, about 9,300 of these being Bachelor, Master or PhD students. The environment at modern day EPFL is highly international with the school attracting students and researchers from all over the world. More than 125 countries are represented on the campus and the university has two official languages, French and English.  Admission and education  Like every public university in Switzerland, EPFL is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss resident who took the maturit√© high-school certificate recognized by the Swiss Confederation. However, international students are required to have a final grade average of 80% or above of the maximum grade of the upper secondary school national system. As such, for Swiss students, EPFL is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedures.The real selection process happens during the first year of study. This period is called the propaedeutic cycle and the students must pass a block examination of all the courses taken during the first year at the end of the cycle. If the weighted average is insufficient, a student is required to retake the entire first year of coursework if they wish to continue their studies at the school. Roughly 50% of students fail the first year of study, and many choose to drop out rather than repeat the first year. The failure rate for the cycle differs between fields, it is highest for Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering where only 30‚Äì40% of students pass the first year. For foreign students, the selection procedure towards the undergraduate program is rather strict, and since most undergraduate courses are taught in French, foreign students must provide documentation of having acquired a level B2 proficiency as measured on the CEF scale, though C1 proficiency is recommended. As at all universities in Switzerland, the academic year is divided into two semesters. Regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the Bachelor of Science degree and four additional semesters for the Master of Science degree. Though only 58% of the student's who manage to graduate are able to graduate within this time-period. The possibility to study abroad for one or two semesters is offered during the 3rd year of study as EPFL maintains several long-standing student exchange programs, such as the junior year engineering and science program with Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, as well as a graduate Aeronautics and Aerospace program with the ISAE in France. The final semester is dedicated to writing a thesis. Entrepreneurship is actively encouraged, as evident by the EPFL Innovation Park being an integral part of campus. Since 1997, 12 start-ups have been created per year on average by EPFL students and faculty. In the year 2013, a total of 105 million CHF was raised by EPFL start- ups.http://information.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/accueil/files/chiffres/2012/EPFL%20in%20figures13-en.pdf  Rankings  The QS World University Rankings ranks EPFL 14th in the world across all fields in their 2020/2021 ranking, whilst Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranks EPFL as the world's 19th best school for Engineering and Technology in 2020. EPFL typically scores high on faculty to student ratio, international outlook and scientific impact. The CWTS Leiden Ranking that \\"aims to provide highly accurate measurements of the scientific impact of universities\\" ranks EPFL world 13th, and 1st in Europe in the 2013 rankings for all the sciences. Although EPFL generally ranks well on measures such as citation index, international outlook and scientific impact, due to the young age and small size of the school, it tends to rank comparatively low in name-brand surveys.

The √âcole d'ing√©nieurs de l'Universit√© de Lausanne, from which EPFL in its modern-day form originates, was located in the center of Lausanne. In 1974, five years after EPFL was separated from University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name, the construction of a new campus at Dorigny in √âcublens, a suburb south-west of Lausanne on the shores of Lake Geneva, began. The inauguration of the first EPFL buildings of the new campus took place in 1978. The EPFL campus has been evolving ever since. The first stage of development, with a total budget of 462 million Swiss francs, was completed in 1984 ;the second in 1990. Construction of the northern parts of campus began in 1995 with the Microtechnology building, completed in 1998, and the architecture building, completed in 2000. In 2002, the department of architecture also moved to the campus in √âcublens, uniting all departments of EPFL on the same site. The latest addition to the EPFL campus is the Rolex Learning Center completed February 2010. The Rolex Learning the univeristy includes areas for work, leisure and services and is located at the center of the campus. The campus is now being expanded with the construction of the SwissTech Convention Center inaugurated in March 2014. Together with the University of Lausanne, also located in √âcublens, the EPFL forms a vast campus complex at the shores of Lake Genevawith about 20,000 students, The campus is served by the Lausanne Metro Line 1 (M1) and is equipped with an electric bicycle sharing system.Campus roule, www.publibike.ch (page visited on 15 May 2013). Since 2012, only electricity from certified hydroelectric generation is being bought by EPFL to power its campus. The university was the first campus to receive the International Sustainable Campus Excellence Award by the International Sustainable Campus Network. Of the 14,000 people that work and study at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne campus, roughly 9.300 are students in either Bachelor, Master or Doctoral programs, the remaining 4,700 being administrative staff, scientists, technical staff, professors and the entrepreneurs located in the Science Park EPFL7. More than 125 nationalities are present on campus with 48% of the student population being foreign nationals. Almost all of the structures are on its main campus.

Within the student body, 112 different nationalities are represented. In the period from 1982 to 2014 the female proportion of the student body has increased from 12% to 27%. The proportion of female students is lowest at the School of Computer Science and Communication, 15%, and highest at the School of Life Sciences, 49%. = Associations= campus. The school encourages the formation of associations and sports activities on campus. As of 2012 more than 79 associations exist on campus for recreational and social purposes. In addition, the school has its own monthly newspaper, Flash. Included in the 79 associations are * AGEPoly is the Student's Association. Its purpose is to represent the EPFL's students, defend the general interests of the students and inform and consult its members on decisions of the EPFL Direction that concern them. * The Forum is a student association responsible for organisation of the Forum EPFL. The Forum was founded in 1982 as a platform for exchange and meeting between the academic and professional communities. Today, it is one of the largest recruiting events in Europe, and the largest in Switzerland. * UNIPOLY is the EPFL Association for Sustainable Development, the Association works to create awareness of sustainable developmenent on campus and in western Switzerland. UNIPOLY is part of the World Student Community for Sustainable Development, an international network of student organisations for sustainable development consisting of EPFL, ETH Zurich, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Tokyo, University of Fort Hare, University of Nairobi, Chalmers, and University of Yaounde. = Music festivals= Several music festivals are held yearlyL. The largest one is the Bal√©lec Festival, organised in May each year since 1981.\\"Festival Balelec\\". People Magazine. Sacha Voeffray The festival welcomes 15,000 visitors to around 30 concerts.\\"Bal√©lec repart pour un tour\\". 24 heures, 27 October 2015\\"Festival Bal√©lec, EPFL Campus, Lausanne, 08.05.2015\\".

The Archimedean Oath has since spread to a number of European engineering schools. The Archimedean Oath is an ethical code of practice for engineers and technicians, similar to the Hippocratic Oath used in the medical world: :\\"I commit to keeping completely, to the full extent of my capacities and judgment, the following promises: I shall use my knowledge for the benefit of mankind. I shall not put my skill to the service of people who do not respect Human Rights. I shall not permit consideration regarding religion, nationality, race, sex, wealth and politics to harm people affected by my actions. I shall bear the entire responsibility for my actions and shall in no way discharge them on another. I shall practice in respect for the environment. I shall not use my knowledge for destructive purposes. I shall practice my profession in complete intellectual honesty, with conscience and dignity. I solemnly take this oath, freely and on my honour.\\"  EPFL Alumni network  The mission of EPFL Alumni is to provide graduates of the school an , international network and a strong and lasting relationship upon graduation. Ii offers graduates a directory of over 30,000 EPFL graduates across the globe with access reserved to alumni. It provides opportunities for meeting, training and consulting, and creates a platform for exchange and services on topics as diverse as career, expatriation, research, entrepreneurship and volunteerism. The alumni group ensures that graduates can benefit from the support of older peers by fostering opportunities to meet in Switzerland or abroad. In 2018, a new initiative was launched for alumni to mentor young graduates and prepare them for the EPFL forum event as well as their first steps in the professional world.

The Z88 evolved from Sir Clive Sinclair's Pandora portable computer project which had been under development at Sinclair Research during the mid-1980s. The machine was launched at the Which Computer? Show on 17 February 1987. Technical description The Z88 is a portable computer weighing 0.9 kg (2 lb), based on a low-power CMOS version of the popular Zilog Z80 microprocessor. It comes with 32 KiB of internal pseudo-static RAM and 128 KiB of ROM containing the operating system (called OZ). The memory can be expanded up to 3.5 MiB of RAM, the contents of which are preserved across sessions. An integrated capacitor prevents the Z88 from losing its data for the limited time it takes to change the batteries. The machine uses a membrane keyboard, which is almost silent in use; an optional electronic \\"click\\" can be turned on to indicate keystrokes. The Z88 is powered by four AA batteries, giving up to 20 hours of use. It has three memory card slots, which accommodate proprietary RAM, EPROM or FLASH cards, the third slot being equipped with a built-in EPROM programmer. Card capacities range from 32 KiB to 1 MiB. The Z88 has a built-in eight-line, 64 √ó 640 pixel \\"super-twisted\\" LCD display which has greater contrast than conventional twisted nematic LCDs. The Z88 used an 8-line LCD display Memory map The 64 KiB addressable by the Z80 processor are divided in four banks of 16 KiB each. The maximum memory of 4 MiB for the system is also divided in 256 segments of 16 KiB each. The hardware can map any of the 16 KiB blocks to any of the four banks. The first 512 KiB are reserved for ROM; the next 512 KiB are reserved for internal RAM. The next 3 MiB are assigned to each one of the three memory slots. Current status The Z88 had something of a cult following, and is still used by a few enthusiasts. A variety of software is available including games and utilities. Since 1998, a 1 MiB Flash memory card is available which provides convenient non-volatile storage. Once written to the card, files are safe and not reliant on a power supply. Unlike traditional EPROM cards (erased with an external ultraviolet light), this one can be electrically erased in the computer's slot. The first generation of card only worked in slot 3 where a 12 V signal (Vpp) is available. The later generation is based on AMD chips and runs with 5 V for erasure. It is possible to read, write and erase flash cards in the three slots and the internal one. It is also possible for an experienced user to replace the built-in 32 KiB RAM chip with a bigger 128 or 512 KiB static RAM chip. However, the latter requires some extra board modifications, and 512 KiB is the biggest size that can be addressed by the Z88 for the internal RAM. A similar modification is possible for the internal ROM slot. A 512 KiB flash chip can replace the original ROM, allowing an upgrade of the operating system.

The film marked Barker's directorial debut. The film involves a puzzle-box which summons the \\"Cenobites\\", a murderous group from another dimension who cannot differentiate between pain and pleasure. They are led by the Lead Cenobite (played by Doug Bradley and identified in the sequels as \\"Pinhead\\"). Hellraiser was filmed in late 1986. Barker originally wanted the electronic music group Coil to perform the music for the film, but on insistence from producers the film was re-scored by Christopher Young. Some of Coil's themes were reworked by Young into the final score. Hellraiser had its first public showing at the Prince Charles Cinema on 10 September 1987. Since release, the film has divided critics but generally received praise; initial reviews ranged from Melody Maker calling it the greatest horror film made in Britain, to Roger Ebert decrying its \\"bankruptcy of imagination\\". It was followed by nine sequels, the first seven of which featured Bradley reprising his role as Pinhead. Plot In Morocco, Frank Cotton buys a puzzle box from a dealer. In a bare attic, when Frank solves the puzzle, hooked chains emerge and tear him apart. Later, the room is filled with swinging chains and covered with the remnants of his body. A black-robed figure picks up the box and returns it to its original state, restoring the room to normal. Some time afterward, Frank's brother Larry moves into the house to rebuild his strained relationship with his second wife, Julia, who had an affair with Frank shortly before their wedding. Larry's teenage daughter, Kirsty, has chosen not to live with them and moves into her own place. Larry cuts his hand carrying a mattress up the stairs, and lets his blood drip on the attic floor. The blood resurrects Frank as a skinless corpse, who is soon found by Julia. Still obsessed with Frank, she agrees to bring people back for him to drain so that he can be fully restored, and they can run away together. Julia begins picking up men in bars and bringing them back to the house, where she mortally wounds them. Frank sinks his hand into the dying bodies, draining their life, regenerating his body. Frank explains to Julia that he had exhausted all sensory experiences and sought out the puzzle box, with the promise that it would open a portal to a realm of new carnal pleasures. When solved, the \\"Cenobites\\" came to subject him to the extremes of sadomasochism. Kirsty spies Julia bringing a man to the house; she follows her to the attic, where she interrupts Frank's latest feeding. Frank attacks her, but Kirsty throws the puzzle box out the window, creating a distraction and allowing her to escape. Kirsty retrieves the box and flees, but collapses shortly thereafter. Awakening in a hospital, Kirsty solves the box, summoning the Cenobites and a monster called the Engineer, which Kirsty narrowly escapes from. The Cenobites' leader explains that although they have been perceived as both angels and demons, they are simply \\"explorers\\" from another dimension seeking carnal experiences, and they can no longer differentiate between pain and pleasure. When they attempt to force Kirsty to return to their realm with them, she informs Pinhead that Frank has escaped. The Cenobites agree to take Frank back and, in exchange, say they will consider giving Kirsty her freedom; however, the catch is that Frank has to confess to escaping them. Kirsty returns home, where Frank has killed Larry and taken his identity by stealing his skin. Julia shows her what is purported to be Frank's flayed corpse in the attic, locking the door behind her. The Cenobites appear and, not fooled by the deception, demand the man who \\"did this\\". Kirsty tries to escape but is held by Julia and Frank. Frank reveals his true identity to Kirsty and, when his sexual advances are rejected, he decides to kill her to complete his rejuvenation. He accidentally stabs Julia instead and drains her without remorse. Frank chases Kirsty to the attic and, when he is about to kill her, the Cenobites appear after hearing him confess to killing her father. Now sure he is the one they are looking for, they ensnare him with chains and tear him to pieces. With Frank out of the picture, the Cenobites decide to take Kirsty. Ripping the puzzle box from Julia's dead hands, Kirsty banishes the Cenobites by reversing the motions needed to open the puzzle box. Kirsty's boyfriend shows up and they both escape the collapsing house. Afterward, Kirsty throws the puzzle box onto a burning pyre. A vagrant who has been stalking Kirsty walks into the fire and retrieves the box before transforming into a winged skeletonized creature and flying away. The box ends up in the hands of the merchant who sold it to Frank, offering it to another prospective customer.

They are from a religious sect in Hell known as the Order of the Gash, describing themselves as \\"explorers in the further regions of experience\\", and granting sadomasochistic pleasures to those who call upon them. Author David McWilliam notes that the Cenobites are described in more explicitly sexual terms in the book compared with their depictions in the film adaptations. Julia, played by Clare Higgins, was Barker's choice to carry the series as its main antagonist after Hellbound, reducing the Cenobites to a background role. However, fans rallied around Pinhead as the breakout character, and Higgins declined to return to the series. In The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters, David McWilliam writes that the Cenobites \\"provide continuity across the series, as the stories become increasingly stand-alone in nature\\". Production Having been dismayed at prior cinematic adaptations of his work, Barker decided to attempt to direct a film himself. Christopher Figg agreed to produce and New World Pictures agreed to fund the film for $900,000. Hellraiser was filmed at the end of 1986 and was set to be made in seven weeks, but was extended over a nine- to ten-week period by New World. The film was originally made under the working title of Sadomasochists from Beyond the Grave. Barker also wanted to call the film Hellbound but producer Christopher Figg suggested Hellraiser instead. Barker spoke fondly in The Hellraiser Chronicles about the filming, stating that his memories of production were of \\"unalloyed fondness ... The cast treated my ineptitudes kindly, and the crew were no less forgiving.\\" Barker admitted his own lack of knowledge on filmmaking, stating that he \\"didn't know the difference between a 10-millimetre lens and a 35-millimetre lens. If you'd shown me a plate of spaghetti and said that was a lens, I might have believed you.\\" After filming, New World convinced Barker to relocate the story to the United States which required overdubbing to remove some British accents. During production, Doug Bradley had trouble hitting his marks during his takes in make-up as he could not see through his black contact lenses and was afraid of tripping over Pinhead's skirts. The special effects of the unnamed creature, known as \\"The Engineer\\" in the novels, proved difficult as the creature was difficult to manoeuvre. Other issues included a rushed shoot of the Chinese restaurant scene with Kirsty and Larry, due to the lateness of the person responsible for letting the cast and crew into the establishment. The film had two editors: Richard Marden and an uncredited Tony Randel. Censorship Clive Barker had to make some cuts on the film after MPAA gave it an X rating. Following scenes were cut for R rating; * Two and a half shots were excised from the first hammer murder, including a closeup of the hammer lodged in the victim's head. * In the scene where Julia murders another man, the actor playing the victim felt that it made sense for him to do so naked. The nude murder scene was shot but, ultimately, replaced with a semi-clothed version. * Close-ups of Kirsty sticking her hand into Frank's stomach, exposing his guts. * Longer version of the scene where Frank is being torn into pieces by the Cenobites' hooks. Final shot where his head explodes and his brain messily splashes out was also cut. In interview for Samhain magazine in July 1987, Barker mentioned some problems that censors had with more erotic scenes in the film; Barker also said on the commentary for the film that the seduction scene between Julia and Frank was, initially, a lot more explicit; \\"We did a version of this scene which had some spanking in it and the MPAA was not very appreciative of that. Lord knows where the spanking footage is. Somebody has it somewhere‚Ä¶The MPAA told me I was allowed two consecutive buttock thrusts from Frank but three is deemed obscene!\\"http://io9.com/all- the-weirdest-secrets-you-never-knew-about-clive-bar-1650487166 Soundtrack Barker originally wanted the electronic music group Coil to perform the music for the film, but that notion was rejected by New World. Editor Tony Randel then suggested Christopher Young as a replacement for Coil for the film's score. Young had previously composed scores for other horror films such as the 1985 slasher A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge and the 1986 Tobe Hooper film Invaders from Mars. The score for Hellraiser was released in 1987. AllMusic stated that the score proved that Christopher Young \\"hadn't used up all of his ideas for the horror genre\\" and that Young had matched \\"Barker's stylish look with a gothic score that mixed in exciting synthesizer effects.\\" Release Hellraiser had its first public showing at the Prince Charles Cinema on 10 September 1987. The film was released in the United States on 18 September 1987; it grossed $14,564,000 in the United States and Canada. Hellraiser was initially banned in Ontario by the Ontario Film and Video Review Board. By a 3-2 majority vote, the film was deemed \\"not approved in its entirety as it contravenes community standards\\". It was banned because of its \\"brutal, graphic violence with blood-letting throughout, horror, degradation and torture.\\" In August 1987, Hellraiser was passed by the Ontario Film Review Board, but only after several cuts were made to the film. New World Mutual Pictures of Canada cut about 40 seconds to get the film passed with an R rating. Thirty-five seconds of an extended torture scene featuring hooks pulling apart a body and face were removed, as well as a scene of squirming rats nailed to a wall. =Critical response= For contemporary reviews in the United Kingdom, Time Out London referred to the film as \\"Barker's dazzling debut\\" that \\"creates such an atmosphere of dread that the astonishing set- pieces simply detonate in a chain reaction of cumulative intensity\\" and concluded that the film was \\"a serious, intelligent and disturbing horror film\\". The Daily Telegraph stated that \\"Barker has achieved a fine degree of menace\\" while The Daily Mail described the film as \\"a pinnacle of the genre\\". Melody Maker described it as \\"the best horror film ever to be made in Britain\\". Kim Newman writing for the Monthly Film Bulletin noted that the most immediately striking aspect of the movie is its seriousness of tone in an era when horror films (the Nightmare on Elm Street or Evil Dead films in particular) tend to be broadly comic.\\" Newman noted that the film \\"suffers from a few minor compromises: notably a decision made fairly late in shooting to change the specifically English setting for an ambiguous (and unbelievable) mid-Atlantic one.\\" Newman also noted that the Cenobites were \\"well used suggestive figures\\" but \\"their monster companion is a more blunderingly obvious concession to the gross-out tastes of the teenage drive-in audience\\". Newman concluded that the film was \\"a return to the cutting edge of horror cinema\\" and that in more gruesome moments the film \\"is a reminder of the grand guignol intensity that has recently tended to disintegrate into lazy splatter\\". Q stated that \\"Hellraiser does have its share of problems: the re- dubbing of peripheral character with a mid-Atlantic twang, the relocation of the film in a geographical limbo [...] The film, however, cannot be faulted for the ambitiousness of its themes [...] Sadly the moral and emotional complexity that is the film's greatest strength is likely to be deemed its greatest weakness by an audience weaned on the misplaced jocularity of House or Fright Night.\\" In the United States, The New York Times stated that Barker cast \\"singularly uninteresting actors\\" while \\"the special effects aren't bad - only damp.\\" The Washington Post referred to the film as a \\"dark, frequently disturbing and occasionally terrifying film\\" but also argued that \\"Barker's vision hasn't quite made the conversion from paper to celluloid [...] There are some weaknesses, particularly the framing of close-ups and the generic score, but there are some moments of genuinely inventive gore [...] the film falls apart at its climax, degenerating to a surprisingly lame ending full of special effects and triumphant good.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film one-half of a star out of four and deemed it \\"as dreary a piece of goods as has masqueraded as horror in many a long, cold night. This is one of those movies you sit through with mounting dread, as the fear grows inside of you that it will indeed turn out to be feature length.\\" and that \\"This is a movie without wit, style or reason, and the true horror is that actors were made to portray, and technicians to realize, its bankruptcy of imagination.\\" Variety stated that Hellraiser is \\"well made, well acted, and the visual effects are generally handled with skill.\\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Hellraiser holds a 72% approval rating based on 46 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.37/10. The consensus reads: ‚ÄúElevated by writer-director Clive Barker's fiendishly unique vision, Hellraiser offers a disquieting - and sadistically smart - alternative to mindless gore.‚Äù In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Hellraiser placed at number 80 on their top 100 list. Home media In North America, Hellraiser has been released by Anchor Bay Entertainment three times, all of which are the original 93-minute version of the film (this is the only version to ever be released on DVD). The original DVD release was a \\"barebones\\" release and is now out of print. It was reissued in 2000 with a new 5.1 mix mastered in THX. Finally, it was packaged along with Hellbound: Hellraiser II in a Limited Edition tin case which included a 48-page colour booklet and a reproduction theatrical poster for both films. Anchor Bay released the film on Blu-ray in 2009. This version retains all of the special features found on the 20th anniversary special edition DVD. In 2011, the film was re-released on Blu-ray by Image Entertainment under the \\"Midnight Madness\\" series label. This version contains no special features.

A remixed and remastered version of Christopher Young's score was also be made available, debuting at the Anniversary screening.  Remake Concept art by Gary Tunnicliffe for Pinhead from Patrick Lussier's defunct Hellraiser reboot. Several ideas and concepts were developed for the project, with William Fichtner at one point considered for the role of the Hell Priest. Dimension Films' remake of Hellraiser was announced in November 2006. French director Pascal Laugier was set to direct the film but was later taken off the project due to creative differences with the producers; Laugier wanted his film to be a very serious take whereas the producers wanted the film to be more commercial and appeal to a teen audience. In October 2007, it was announced that French filmmakers Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo would write and direct the remake. However, this version would also not come to fruition. In 2011 the duo discussed with Collider the reasons that ultimately led to their departure from the project. As Maury related: \\"The problem was that we couldn‚Äôt agree on the script with the studio. It‚Äôs kind of obvious why. We are hardcore fans of the original and we wanted to be respectful to Clive Barker‚Äôs universe. Without his greenlight, we never would have done it. We wouldn‚Äôt have even considered it. But Bob Weinstein of course had his own vision of the movie and wants to have a movie that can appeal to the largest possible audience...For us, it wasn‚Äôt possible to make something that could be both.\\" On 20 October 2010, it was officially announced that Patrick Lussier and Todd Farmer were to direct and write, respectively, the reboot of Hellraiser . The film's story would differ from the original film, as Lussier and Farmer did not want to retell the original story out of respect for Clive Barker's work. The film was to instead focus on the world and function of the puzzle box. Lussier and Farmer dismissed the notion of a teen-oriented Hellraiser film, stating \\"if we do Hellraiser, it's rated R; if they want to do PG-13 then they have to get rid of us\\". In 2011, Farmer confirmed that both he and Lussier were no longer attached to the project. On 24 October 2013, Clive Barker posted on his official Facebook page that he would be personally writing the remake of the original Hellraiser and that he had already completed a deal with Dimension Films' Bob Weinstein. He also stated that he would be pushing for practical effects rather than CGI and the original Pinhead actor Doug Bradley would be reprising the role.https://aintitcool.com/node/64798 On 18 March 2017, Clive Barker revealed that the film had not moved forward: \\"The script was written and delivered to Dimension years ago. That was the last anyone heard until news of [Hellraiser: Judgment] surfaced.\\" After the successful release of the 2018 horror sequel Halloween, Miramax Films confirmed that it was considering beginning production on new installments to the Hellraiser franchise. On May 9, 2019, Gary Barber announced that the Spyglass Media Group would be developing a new remake of Hellraiser to be written and co-produced by David S. Goyer. In April 2020, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that David Bruckner will direct the remake and Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski will write the script.

The seat of the Duke of Devonshire, it has been home to the Cavendish family since 1549. Standing on the east bank of the River Derwent, it looks across to the low hills between the Derwent and Wye valleys. The house is set in expansive parkland and backed by wooded, rocky hills rising to heather moorland. It contains major collections of paintings, furniture, Old Master drawings, neoclassical sculptures, books and other artefacts. Chatsworth has been chosen as Britain's favourite country house several times. History =11th‚Äì16th centuries= 17th-century painting of the west front of the Elizabethan Chatsworth The name 'Chatsworth' is a corruption of Chetel's-worth, meaning \\"the Court of Chetel\\". In the reign of Edward the Confessor, a man of Norse origin named Chetel held lands jointly with a Saxon named Leotnoth in three townships: Ednesoure to the west of the Derwent, and Langoleie and Chetesuorde to the east. Chetel was deposed after the Norman Conquest and in the Domesday Book the Manor of Chetesuorde is listed as the property of the Crown in the custody of William de Peverel. Chatsworth ceased to be a large estate, until the 15th century when it was acquired by the Leche family who owned property nearby. They enclosed the first park at Chatsworth and built a house on the high ground in what is now the south-eastern part of the garden. In 1549 they sold all their property in the area to Sir William Cavendish, Treasurer of the King's Chamber and the husband of Bess of Hardwick, who had persuaded him to sell his property in Suffolk and settle in her native county. Bess began to build the new house in 1553. She selected a site near the river, which was drained by digging a series of reservoirs, which doubled as fish ponds. Sir William died in 1557, but Bess finished the house in the 1560s and lived there with her fourth husband, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1568 Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, and brought his prisoner to Chatsworth several times from 1570 onwards. She lodged in the apartment now known as the Queen of Scots rooms, on the top floor above the great hall, which faces onto the inner courtyard. An accomplished needlewoman, Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the Oxburgh Hangings. Bess died in 1608 and Chatsworth was passed to her eldest son, Henry. The estate was purchased from Henry by his brother William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire, for ¬£10,000. =17th century= Kip and Knyff shows Chatsworth part way through the 1st Duke's alterations. The south front has been rebuilt but the original east front survives. The baroque garden has been laid out, but only the first, smaller version of the Cascade has been built, and the Canal Pond has not been dug. The 1st Duke's stables are to the left of the house Few changes were made at Chatsworth until the mid-17th century. William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire was a staunch Royalist and expelled from the House of Lords in 1642. He left England for the safety of the continent and his estates were sequestrated. Chatsworth was occupied by both sides during the Civil War, and the 3rd Earl did not return to the house until the restoration of the monarchy. He reconstructed the principal rooms in an attempt to make them more comfortable, but the Elizabethan house was outdated and unsafe. The 4th Earl of Devonshire, who was to become the 1st Duke in 1694 for helping to put William of Orange on the English throne, was an advanced Whig and forced to retire to Chatsworth during the reign of King James II. This called for a rebuilding of the house, which began in 1687. Cavendish initially planned to reconstruct only the south wing with the State Apartments, and so he decided to retain the Elizabethan courtyard plan, though this layout was becoming increasingly unfashionable. He enjoyed building and reconstructed the East Front, which included the Painted Hall and Long Gallery, followed by the West Front from 1699 to 1702. The North Front was completed in 1707 just before he died. The 1st Duke also had large parterre gardens designed by George London and Henry Wise, who was later appointed by Queen Anne as Royal Gardner at Kensington Palace. =18th century= romantic aspect of Chatsworth's setting on the edge of the Peak District William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire, and William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire, made no changes to the house and gardens, but both contributed greatly to the collection found at Chatsworth to this date. Connoisseur of the arts the collection include paintings, Old Master drawings and prints, ancient coins and carved Greek and Roman sculptures. Palladian furniture designed by William Kent was commissioned by the 3rd Duke when he had Devonshire House in London rebuilt following a fire in 1733. Upon the sale and demolition of Devonshire House in 1924 the furniture was transferred to Chatsworth. The 4th Duke made great changes to the house and gardens. He decided the approach to the house should be from the west and had the old stables and offices as well as parts of Edensor village pulled down so they were not visible from the house. He also replaced the 1st Duke's formal gardens with a more natural look, designed by Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown, which he helped bring into fashion. In 1748, the 4th Duke married Lady Charlotte Boyle, the sole surviving heiress of Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington. Lord Burlington was an accomplished architect in his own right with many works to his name including Chiswick House. With his death, his important collection of architectural drawings and Inigo Jones masque designs, Old Master paintings and William Kent designed furniture were transferred to the Dukes of Devonshire. This inheritance also brought many estates to the family. In 1774, William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, married Georgiana Spencer famous as a socialite who gathered around her a large circle of literary and political friends. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds would paint her; the Gainsborough painting would be disposed of by the 5th Duke and be recovered much later, after many vicissitudes. The film The Duchess portrayed their life together. Georgiana was the great-great- great-great aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales; their lives, centuries apart, have been compared in tragedy. =19th century= The 6th Duke (known as 'the Bachelor Duke') was a passionate traveller, builder, gardener and collector who transformed Chatsworth. In 1811 he inherited the title and eight major estates; Chatsworth and Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire, Devonshire House, Burlington House and Chiswick House in London, Bolton Abbey and Londesborough Hall in Yorkshire, and Lismore Castle in Ireland. These estates covered of land in England and Ireland. The 6th Duke's dining room The Duke was a great collector especially of sculpture and books. When he built the North Wing to the designs of Sir Jeffry Wyatville, it included a purpose built Sculpture Gallery to house his collection, and he repurposed several rooms in the house to contain the entire libraries he would purchase at auction. The 6th Duke loved to entertain, and the early 19th century saw a rise in popularity of country house parties. In addition to a sculpture gallery, the new north wing housed an orangery, a theatre, a Turkish bath, a dairy, a vast new kitchen and numerous servants rooms. In 1830 the Duke increased the guest accommodation by converting suites of rooms into individual guest bedrooms. People invited to stay at Chatsworth spent their days hunting, riding, reading and playing billiards. In the evening formal dinners would take place, followed by music, charades and billiards or conversation in the smoking room for the men. Women would return to their bedroom many times during the day to change their outfits. The guest bedrooms on the east front at Chatsworth are the most complete set of bedrooms from the period to survive with their original furnishings. There is much eastern influence in the decoration including hand- painted Chinese wallpapers and fabrics which are typical of Regency taste, which developed during the reign of George IV (1762‚Äì1830). People who have stayed at Chatsworth include Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens. A view of Chatsworth from the south-west circa 1880. The stables can be seen behind the house and the Hunting Tower is visible in Stand Wood In October 1832, Princess Victoria (later Queen Victoria) and her mother, the Duchess of Kent, visited Chatsworth where she had her first formal adult dinner, at the age of 13, in the new dining room. The 6th Duke had another opportunity to welcome Victoria in 1843 when the Queen and Prince Albert returned to be entertained by a large array of illuminated fountains. The Duke spent 47 years transforming the house and gardens. A Latin inscription over the fireplace in the Painted Hall translates as, \\"William Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, inherited this most beautiful house from his father in the year 1811, which had been begun in the year of English liberty 1688, and completed it in the year of his bereavement 1840\\". 1688 was the year of the Glorious Revolution, supported by the Whig dynasties including the Cavendishes. The year 1840 saw the death of the Duke's beloved niece Blanche, who was married to his heir, the future 7th Duke. In 1844 he published a book called Handbook to Chatsworth and Hardwick. =20th century= Chatsworth, c. 1913. In the early 20th century social change and taxes began to affect the Devonshires' lifestyle. When the 8th Duke died in 1908 over ¬£500,000 of death duties became due. This was a small charge compared to what followed forty-two years later, but the estate was already burdened with debt from the 6th Duke's extravagances, the failure of the 7th Duke's business ventures at Barrow-in-Furness, and the depression in British agriculture that had been apparent since the 1870s. In 1912 the family sold 25 books printed by William Caxton and a collection of 1,347 volumes of plays acquired by the 6th Duke, including four Shakespeare folios and 39 Shakespeare quartos, to the Huntington Library in California. Tens of thousands of acres of land in Somerset, Sussex and Derbyshire were also sold during, and immediately after, World War I. In December 1904, King Charles I of Portugal and Queen Maria Am√©lia stayed at Chatsworth House during their visit to Great Britain. It snowed almost constantly while they were there, and the King reportedly started a snowball fight (in which the assembled ladies enthusiastically joined) when he met the Marquis of Soveral, the Portuguese Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St James's. In 1920 the family's London mansion, Devonshire House, which occupied a site in Piccadilly, was sold to developers and demolished. Much of its contents was moved to Chatsworth and a much smaller house at 2 Carlton Gardens near The Mall was acquired. The Great Conservatory in the garden at Chatsworth was demolished as it needed 10 men to run it, huge quantities of coal to heat it, and all the plants had died during the war, when no coal had been available for non-essential purposes. To reduce running costs further, there was talk of pulling down the 6th Duke's north wing, which was then regarded as having no aesthetic or historical value, but nothing came of it. Chiswick House‚Äîthe celebrated Palladian villa in the suburbs of West London that the Devonshires inherited when the 4th Duke married Lord Burlington's daughter‚Äîwas sold in 1929 for ¬£80,000 to Middlesex County Council and Brentford and Chiswick Urban District CouncilWest London Observer, March 1929. Nonetheless, life at Chatsworth continued much as before. The household was run by a comptroller and domestic staff were still available, although more so in the country than in the cities. Those at Chatsworth at this time consisted of a butler, an under-butler, a groom of the chambers, a valet, three footmen, a housekeeper, the Duchess's maid, 11 housemaids, two sewing women, a cook, two kitchen maids, a vegetable maid, two or three scullery maids, two still-room maids, a dairy maid, six laundry maids and the Duchess's secretary. All of these 38 or 39 people lived in the house. Daily staff included the odd man, upholsterer, scullery-maid, two scrubbing women, laundry porter, steam boiler man, coal man, two porter's lodge attendants, two night firemen, night porter, two window cleaners, and a team of joiners, plumbers and electricians. The Clerk of Works supervised the maintenance of the house and other properties on the estate. There were also grooms, chauffeurs and gamekeepers. The number of garden staff was somewhere between 80 in the 6th Duke's time and the 20 or so in the early 21st century. There was also a librarian, Francis Thompson, who wrote the first book-length account of Chatsworth since the 6th Duke's handbook. Most of the UK's country houses were put to institutional use during World War II. Some of those used as barracks were badly damaged, but the 10th Duke, anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, arranged for Chatsworth to be occupied by Penrhos College, a girls' public school in Colwyn Bay, Wales. The contents of the house were packed away in 11 days and, in September 1939, 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six- year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort. In May 1944 Kathleen Kennedy, sister of John F. Kennedy, married William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, the elder son of the 10th Duke of Devonshire. However, he was killed in action in Belgium in September 1944, and Kathleen died in a plane crash in 1948. His younger brother Andrew became the 11th Duke in 1950. He was married to Deborah Mitford, one of the Mitford girls and sister to Nancy Mitford, Diana Mitford, Pamela Mitford, Unity Mitford and Jessica Mitford Chatsworth House viewed from the top of the Cascade The modern history of Chatsworth begins in 1950. The family had not yet moved back after the war, and although the 10th Duke had transferred his assets to his son during his lifetime in the hope of avoiding death duties, he died a few weeks too early for the lifetime exemption to apply, and tax was charged at 80 per cent on the whole estate. The amount due was ¬£7 million (¬£ as of ). Some of the family's advisors considered the situation to be irretrievable, and there was a proposal to transfer Chatsworth to the nation as a Victoria and Albert Museum of Northern England. Instead, the Duke decided to retain his family's home if he could. He sold tens of thousands of acres of land, transferred Hardwick Hall to the National Trust in lieu of tax, and sold some major works of art from Chatsworth. The family's Sussex house, Compton Place was lent to a school. The effect of the death duties was mitigated to some extent by the historically low value of art during the post-war years and the increase in land values, subsequent to 1950, during the post-war agricultural revival, and on the face of it the losses were considerably less than 80 per cent in terms of physical assets. In Derbyshire were retained out of . The Bolton Abbey estate in Yorkshire and the Lismore Castle estate in Ireland remained in the family. Nonetheless, it took 17 years to complete negotiations with the Inland Revenue, interest being due in the meantime. The Chatsworth Estate is now managed by the Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, which was established in 1946. A modern view of the house The 10th Duke was pessimistic about the future of houses like Chatsworth, and made no plans to move back in after the war. After Penrhos College left in 1945 the only people who slept in the house were two housemaids, but over the winter of 1948‚Äì1949 the house was cleaned and tidied for reopening to the public by two Hungarian women, who had been Kathleen Kennedy's cook and housemaid in London, and a team of their compatriots. The house was Grade I listed in 1951 after the passage of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. In the mid-1950s, the 11th Duke and Duchess began to think about moving into the house. The pre-war house had relied entirely on a large staff for its comforts and lacked modern facilities. The building was rewired, the plumbing and heating were overhauled, and six self-contained staff flats were created to replace the small staff bedrooms and communal servants' hall. Including those in the staff flats, 17 bathrooms were added to the existing handful. The 6th Duke's cavernous kitchen was abandoned and a new one was created closer to the family dining room. The family rooms were repainted, carpets were brought out of store and curtains were repaired or replaced. The Duke and Duchess and their three children moved across the park from Edensor House in 1959. In 1981, the trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, owners of the house, created a new Chatsworth House Trust. The intention was to preserve the house and its setting for \\"the benefit of the public\\".Peak District Online Retrieved 24 September 2014. The new trust was granted a 99-year lease, covering the house, its principal contents, its grounds, its precincts and adjacent forestry, a total of . To legalise the arrangement, the Chatsworth House Trust pays a token rent of ¬£1 a year. To facilitate the arrangement and establish a sufficient multi-million-pound endowment fund, the trustees sold works of art, mostly old masters' drawings, which had not been on regular display. The family is represented on the House Trust's Council of Management, but the majority of directors are not family members. The Duke pays a market rent for the use of his private apartments in the house. The cost of running the house and grounds is about ¬£4 million a year. =21st century= Renovation of Chatsworth House, 2011 The 11th Duke died in 2004 and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke, Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire. The 11th Duke's widow, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, died on 24 September 2014. Up until her death she was very active in promoting the estate and increasing its visitor income. She was responsible for many additions to the gardens, including the maze, the kitchen, the cottage gardens and several commissions of modern sculpture. She also wrote seven books about different aspects of Chatsworth and its estate. A structural survey in 2004 showed that major renovation to the house was required. A¬£32 million programme of works was subsequently undertaken, including the restoration of stonework, statues, paintings, tapestries and water features. The work, the most extensive for 200 years, took ten years and was completed in 2018. Architecture Chatsworth House is built on sloping ground, lower on the north and west sides than on the south and east sides. The original Tudor mansion was built in the 1560s by Bess of Hardwick in a quadrangle layout, approximately from north to south and from east to west, with a large central courtyard. The main entrance was on the west front, which was embellished with four towers or turrets, and the great hall in the medieval tradition was on the east side of the courtyard, where the Painted Hall remains the focus of the house to this day. The south and east fronts were rebuilt under the order of William Talman and were completed by 1696 for William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire. The 1st Duke's Chatsworth was a key building in the development of English Baroque architecture. According to the architectural historian Sir John Summerson, \\"It inaugurates an artistic revolution which is the counterpart of the political revolution in which the Earl was so prominent a leader.\\" The design of the south front was revolutionary for an English house, with no attics or hipped roof, but instead two main stories supported by a rusticated basement. The facade is dramatic and sculptural with ionic pilasters and a heavy entablature and balustrade. The existing heavy and angular stone stairs from the first floor down to the garden are a 19th-century replacement of an elegant curved double staircase. The east front is the quietest of the four on the main block. Like the south front it is unusual in that it has an even number of bays and no centrepiece. The emphasis is placed on the end bays, each highlighted by double pairs of pilasters, of which the inner pairs project outwards. The West Front of Chatsworth from Colen Campbell's Vitruvius BritannicusThe west and north fronts may have been the work of Thomas Archer, possibly in collaboration with the Duke himself. The west front has nine wide bays with a central pediment supported by four columns and pilasters to the other bays. Due to the slope of the site this front is taller than the south front. It is also large, with many other nine-bay three-storey facades little more than half as wide and tall. The west front is very lively with much carved stonework, and the window frames are highlighted with gold leaf, which catches the setting sun. The north front was the last to be built. It presented a challenge, as the north end of the west front projected nine feet (3 m) further than the north end of the east front. This problem was overcome by building a slightly curved facade to distract the eye. The attic windows on this side are the only ones visible on the exterior of the house and are set into the main facade, rather than into a visible roof. Those in the curved section were originally oval, but are now rectangular like those in the end sections. The north front was altered in the 19th century when William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, along with the architect Jeffry Wyatville, built the North Wing, doubling the size of the house. Most of this wing only has two storeys, compared to the three of the main block. It is attached to the north-east corner of the house, and is around 400 feet (120 m) long. At the end of the North Wing is the North, or Belvedere, Tower. The work was carried out in an Italianate style that blends smoothly with the elaborate finish of the baroque house. The 6th Duke built a gatehouse at this end of the house with three gates. The central and largest gate led to the North Entrance, then the main entrance to the house. This is now the entrance used by visitors. The north gate led to the service courtyard, and the matching south gate led to the original front door in the west front, which was relegated to secondary status in the Duke's time, but is now the family's private entrance once again. The facades to the central courtyard were also rebuilt by the 1st Duke. The courtyard was larger than it is now, as there were no corridors on the western side and the northern and southern sides only had enclosed galleries on the first floor with open galleries below. In the 19th century, new accommodation was built on these three sides on all three levels. The only surviving baroque facade is that on the eastern side, where five bays of the original seven remain, and are largely as built. There are carved trophies by Samuel Watson, a Derbyshire craftsman who did a lot of work at Chatsworth in stone, marble and wood. Interiors The 1st and 6th Dukes both inherited an old house, and tried to adapt to the lifestyle of their time without changing the fundamentals of its layout, making Chatsworth's layout unique, full of irregularities and the interiors a collection of different styles. Many of the rooms are recognisable of one main period, but in nearly every case, they have been altered more often than might be supposed at first glance. =State apartments= Painted Hall with murals completed 1694 by thumb thumb Library 1694‚Äì1700 plaster work by Edward Goudge, ceiling paintings by James Thornhill, bookcases and fireplace by Jeffry Wyatville 1824 The 1st Duke created a richly appointed Baroque suite of state rooms across the south front in anticipation of a visit by King William III and Queen Mary II that never occurred. The State Apartments are accessed from the Painted Hall, decorated with murals showing scenes from the life of Julius Caesar by Louis Laguerre, and ascending the cantilevered Great Stairs to the enfilade of rooms that would control how far a person could progress into the presence of the King and Queen. The Great Chamber is the largest room in the State Apartments, followed by the State Drawing Room, the Second Withdrawing Room, the State Bedroom and finally the State Closet with each room being more private and ornate than the last. The Great Chamber includes a painted ceiling of a classical scene by Antonio Verrio. The Second Withdrawing Room was renamed the State Music Room by the 6th Duke when he brought the violin door here from Devonshire House in London. The door features a very convincing trompe l'oeil of a violin and bow \\"hanging\\" on a silver knob, painted around 1723 by Jan van der Vaart. Around the time Queen Victoria decided that Hampton Court, with its state apartments in the same style, was uninhabitable, the 6th Duke wrote that he was tempted to demolish the State Apartments to make way for new bedrooms. However, sensitive to his family's heritage, he left the rooms largely untouched, making additions rather than change the existing spaces of the house. Changes to the main baroque interiors were restricted to details such as stamped leather hangings on the walls of the State Music Room and State Bedroom, and a wider and shallower, but less elegant staircase in the Painted Hall, which was itself later replaced. The contents of the State Apartments were rearranged in 2010 to reflect the way they would have looked in the 17th and 18th centuries. =18th-century alterations= In the 1760s, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire redirected the approach to Chatsworth. He converted the kitchen in the centre of the north front into an entrance hall from which guests would walk through an open colonnade in the courtyard, through a passage past the cook's bedroom and the back stairs and into the Painted Hall. He then built an neoclassical service wing for his kitchens that were a forerunner of the 6th Duke's north wing. William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire had some of the family's private rooms redecorated and some partition walls were moved, but there are few traces of the mid- and late 18th century in the public rooms. =19th-century alterations= Venus supported by Iris, complaining to Mars by George Hayter, exhibited in 1820 at the RA \\"to acclaim\\" (in the Ceiling of the Ante Library Chatsworth House) ‚Äì Winner of the Royal Academy Painting of the Year in 1823 The 6th Duke conducted many modernisations of Chatsworth House to meet 19th-century standards of comfort, that suited a less formal lifestyle than that of the 1st Duke's time. The corridors around the edges of the courtyard were enclosed and furnished with a multicoloured marble floor, so that rooms could be easily reached from indoors, and more shared living rooms to replace individual guest apartments. The cook's bedroom and the back stairs made way for the Oak Stairs, topped by a glass dome, that were built at the northern end of the Painted Hall to improve internal communications. Along this staircase hang portraits of the first 11 Dukes and some of their family members. The Duke transformed the long gallery, originally created by the 1st Duke, into a library. He was a great lover of books and purchased entire libraries. The Ante-Library in the adjoining room was originally used by the 1st Duke as a dining room and then a billiard room before the 6th Duke used it to house his increasing collection of books. This was just one of the rooms in which the Duke installed a single pane window, which he believed to be the 'greatest ornament of modern decoration'. The window in the Ante-Library is the only one to have been preserved. Much of the scientific library of Henry Cavendish (1731‚Äì1810) is in this room. The most notable addition by the 6th Duke to Chatsworth was the Wyatville designed North Wing. Plans for a symmetrical wing to the south were begun but later abandoned. The entire ground floor of the North Wing was occupied by service rooms, including a kitchen, servants' hall, laundry, butler and housekeeper's rooms. On the first floor, facing west, were two sets of bachelor bedrooms called 'California' and 'The Birds.' The main rooms in the new wing face east, and were accessed from the main house through a small library called the Dome Room. The first room beyond this is a dining room, with a music gallery in the serving lobby where the musicians played. Next is the sculpture gallery, the largest room in the house, and then the orangery. The Belvedere Tower contains a plunge bath, using the marble from the 1st Duke's bathroom, and a ballroom that was later turned into a theatre by the 8th Duke. Above the theatre is the belvedere itself, an open viewing platform below the roof. =Private rooms= Chatsworth has 126 rooms, with nearly 100 of them closed to visitors. The house is well adapted to allow the family to live privately in their apartments while the house is open to the public. Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire described the family rooms in detail in her book Chatsworth: The House. She lived at Edensor until her death in 2014, and the present (12th) Duke and Duchess live at Chatsworth. The family occupies rooms on the ground and first floors of the south front, all three floors of the west front, and the upper two floors of the north front. Staircases in the northeast corner of the main block and in a turret in the east front enable them to move about without crossing the public route. The main family living rooms are on the first floor of the south front. The family dining room is in the southeast corner and has the same dimensions as the State Dining Room directly above. This has been the usual location of the family dining room; the Bachelor Duke's dining room in the north wing took over that role for an interlude of little more than a hundred years. Both Bess of Hardwick's house and the 1st Duke's house had a hierarchy of three dining rooms in this corner, each taller and more lavishly decorated than the one below. A common parlour on the ground floor was used by the gentlemen of the household, and later for informal family meals. Above it was the main family dining room, and at the top the Great Chamber, which was reserved for royalty, although the 6th Duke wrote that, to his knowledge, it had never been used. The yellow drawing room, is next to the dining room and directly underneath the State Drawing Room. The Dowager Duchess has written that the house is so solidly built that the crowds passing above are imperceptible. The trio of reception rooms here is completed by the blue drawing room, which is below the State Music Room. This was created in the 18th century by knocking together the 1st Duke's bedroom and dressing room, and has a door to his private gallery at the upper level of the chapel. It has also served as a billiard room and as a school room. Charity events are sometimes held in this part of the house. Both drawing rooms have access to the garden through the South Front's external staircase. Three corridors called 'the Tapestry Gallery', 'the Burlington Corridor' and 'the Book Passage' are wrapped around the south, west and north passages at this level, and give access to family bedrooms. There is a sitting room in the north-west corner ‚Äî one of the few rooms in the house with outside views in two directions. There are more family bedrooms on the second floor facing west and north. The Scots and Leicester bedrooms in the east wing are still used when there is a large house party, which is the reason why sometimes they are available as a separately charged optional extra in the tour of the house and sometimes they are not. This suite of rooms now contains the 11th Duke's Exhibition. Visitors bypass the first floor on their way down the West Stairs from the state rooms to the chapel. The private north stairs lead down to more private rooms on the ground floor of the West Front. In the centre is the West Entrance Hall, which is, once again, the family entrance. To the right, on entering, is a passage room known as the mineral room, which leads through to a study. To the left there is the Leather Room; with walls of leather and a great many books this is one of at least six libraries in the house. The next room is the Duke's Study, which has two windows, many more books and floral decoration painted for the Bachelor Duke by, in his own words, \\"three bearded artists in blouses imported from Paris.\\" The corner room on the ground floor is the former 'little dining room'. These rooms are all very high, as the ground level in the west wing is lower than that of the Painted Hall and the ground floor corridors around the courtyard. Steps from the West Entrance Hall lead up to the west corridor. The other family living rooms are in the eastern half of the ground floor of the South Front and can be reached through the Chapel Corridor on the public route, or the turret staircase from the dining room. The room in the south-east corner was once the Ducal bathroom, until the Bachelor Duke built his new plunge bath in the North Wing, and is now the pantry where the family china is kept. This connects to the modern kitchen, which is under the library and was made out of the steward's room and the linen room. Next to the pantry in the south front are offices. Park and landscape Chatsworth's garden attracts around 300,000 visitors a year. It has a complex blend of different features from six different centuries and covers . The garden is surrounded by a wall 1.75 miles (2.8 km) long. It sits on the eastern side of the valley of the Derwent River and blends into the landscape of the surrounding park, which covers . The woods on the moors to the east of the valley form a backdrop to the garden. There is a staff of approximately 20 full-time gardeners. The average rainfall is around 33.7 inches (855 mm) a year, and there are an average of 1,160 sunshine hours a year. Most of the principal features of the garden were created in five main phases of development. =Elizabethan garden= The house and garden were first constructed by Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick in 1555. The Elizabethan garden was much smaller than the modern garden is now. There were terraces to the east of the house where the main lawn is now, ponds and fountains to the south, and fishponds to the west by the river. The main visual remnant of this time is a squat stone tower known as Queen Mary's Bower on account of a legend that Mary, Queen of Scots, was allowed to take the air there while she was a prisoner at Chatsworth. The bower is now outside the garden wall in the park. Some of the retaining walls of the West Garden also date to this era, but they were reconstructed and extended later. A panoramic view of Chatsworth House and Park, early 18th century (Pieter Tillemans) =1st Duke's garden (1684‚Äì1707)= At the same time as he was rebuilding the house, the 1st Duke also created baroque gardens. It featured numerous parterres cut into the slopes above the house, and many fountains, garden buildings and classical sculptures. The principal surviving features from this time are: thumb thumb *The Cascade and Cascade House is a set of stone steps over which water flows from a set of fountains at the top. It was built in 1696 and rebuilt on a grander scale in 1701. In 1703 a grand baroque Temple or Cascade House designed by Thomas Archer was added at the top. A major restoration of both the Cascade and the Cascade House in 1994‚Äì1996 took 10,000-man-hours of work. In 2004 the Cascade was voted the best water feature in England by a panel of 45 garden experts organised by Country Life. It has 24 cut steps, each slightly different and with a variety of textures so that each gives a different sound when water runs over and down them. *The Canal Pond, dug in 1702, is a -long rectangular lake to the south of the house. *The Seahorse Fountain is a sculptural fountain in a circular pond on the lawn between the house and the Canal Pond. Originally, it was the centrepiece of the main parterre. *The Willow Tree Fountain is an imitation tree that squirts water on the unsuspecting from its branches. The writer Celia Fiennes wrote in her diary: \\"There ... in the middle of ye grove stands a fine willow tree, the leaves, barke and all looks very naturall, ye roote is full of rubbish or great stones to appearance and all on a sudden by ye turning of a sluice it rains from each leafe and from the branches like a shower, it being made of brass and pipes to each leafe, but in appearance is exactly like any willow.\\" The tree has been replaced twice and then restored in 1983. *The First Duke's greenhouse is a long, low building with ten arched windows and a temple-like centrepiece. It has been moved from its original site overlooking the 1st Duke's bowling green to the northern edge of the main lawn and is now fronted by a rose garden. *Flora's Temple is a classical temple built in 1695 and moved to its present site at the northern end of the broad walk in 1760. It contains a statue of the goddess Flora by Caius Gabriel Cibber. *The West Garden‚Äînow the family's private garden with modern planting in a three-section formal structure‚Äîis mainly a creation of the 1st Duke's time, but the layout is not original. =4th Duke's garden (1755‚Äì64)= The 4th Duke commissioned the landscape architect, Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown to transform the garden in the fashionable naturalistic landscape style of the day. Most of the ponds and parterres were converted to lawns, but as detailed above several important features were spared. Many trees were planted, including various American species specially imported from Philadelphia in 1759. The main aim of this work was to improve integration of the garden and park. Brown's 5.5 acre (22,000 m2) Salisbury Lawns still form the setting of the Cascade. =6th Duke's garden (1826‚Äì58)= The Rockeries The Emperor Fountain Neoclassical sculpture, Chatsworth House garden In 1826 a 23-year-old named Joseph Paxton, who had been trained at Kew Gardens, was appointed head gardener at Chatsworth. The 6th Duke had inherited Chatsworth fifteen years earlier and had previously shown little interest in improving the neglected garden, but he soon formed a productive and extravagantly funded partnership with Paxton, who proved to be the most innovative garden designer of his era, and remains the greatest single influence on Chatsworth's garden. Features that survive from that time include: *The Rockeries and The Strid: in 1842 Paxton began work on a rockery of a gargantuan scale, piling rocks weighing several tons one on top of another. One of them was described thus by Lord Desart in the 1860s: \\"In one place a sort of miniature Matterhorn apparently blocked the path but with the touch of the finger it revolved on a metal axis and made a way to pass.\\" It is now locked in place to comply with health and safety regulations. Another rock is so balanced that it can be swayed with little pressure. Two rocks are named for the Queen and Prince Albert, and another for the Duke of Wellington, all of whom visited Chatsworth in the 6th Duke's time. The Wellington Rock, a construction of several rocks piled on top of each other, is 45 feet (14 m) high and a small waterfall drips over it into a pond. Sometimes in the winter the water freezes creating icicles. The water flows into a pond created by Paxton called 'The Strid', which is named after a stretch of the River Wharfe on the Devonshires' Bolton Abbey estate, where the river is compressed into a turbulent chasm just a yard wide. Chatsworth's Strid is a placid stretch of water fringed with rocks and luxuriant vegetation and crossed by a rustic bridge. *The Arboretum and Pinetum: the 6th Duke's time was an age of plant-hunting expeditions, with major new species readily discovered by intrepid botanists, and the Duke was one of the most generous sponsors. In 1829 he took an additional eight acres (32,000 m2) of the park into the garden to create a pinetum, and in 1835 Paxton began work on an arboretum, which was planned as a systematic succession of trees in accordance with botanical classification. Chatsworth has some of the oldest specimens of species such as Douglas fir and Giant Sequoia in the UK. Also in this part of the garden is the Grotto Pond, which was originally a fishpond, breeding fish for Chatsworth's table. The 6th Duke's mother had had the rustic grotto built at the end of the 18th century. The area around the pond is now planted for autumn colour. *The Azalea Dell and the Ravine: Rhododendrons and Azaleas grow well at Chatsworth as the soil suits them, and a section of the southern end of the garden is devoted to them. This is the most rugged part of the garden with steep serpentine paths and a stream running down a small valley known as The Ravine. In 1997 a waterfall was created out of old drinking troughs gathered from fields on the estate. There is also a bamboo walk there. *The Emperor Fountain: in 1843 Tsar Nicholas I of Russia informed the Duke that he was likely to visit Chatsworth the following year. In anticipation of this Imperial visit, the Duke decided to construct the world's highest fountain, and set Paxton to work to build it. An eight-acre (32,000 m2) lake was dug on the moors 350 feet (110 m) above the house to supply the natural water pressure. The work was finished in just six months, continuing at night by the light of flares, and the resulting water jet is on record as reaching a height of 296 feet (90 m). However, the Tsar died in 1855 and never saw the fountain. Because of the limited supply of water the fountain usually runs on partial power and only reaches half its full height, but occasionally it is switched to maximum flow.Emperor Fountain goes sky high, Chatsworth press release, 25 April 2007. The water power found a practical use generating Chatsworth's electricity from 1893 to 1936. The house was then connected to the mains, and a new turbine was installed in 1988 that produces about a third of the electricity the house needs. *The Conservative Wall is a set of greenhouses that run up the slope from Flora's Temple to the stables against the north wall of the garden. A tall central section is flanked by ten smaller sections. They are used to grow fruit and camellias. Two Camellia reticulata 'Captain Rawes' planted in 1850 survive. Chatsworth's camellias have won many prizes. The name of the building has no political connotations; the Dukes of Devonshire were Whigs and later Liberals. Paxton's daughter Annie standing on a Victoria amazonica leaf in the lily house The Great Conservatory at Chatsworth. Built from 1836 to 1841 and demolished in 1920. Paxton was responsible, along with architect Decimus Burton, for Chatsworth's Great Conservatory, which began construction in 1836 and was completed in 1841. It was 277 feet (84 m) long, 123 feet (37 m) wide and 61 feet (19 m) high making it the largest glass house in the world at that time and cost ¬£33,099. A carriage drive ran the length of the building between lush tropical vegetation. One W. Adam called it \\"A mountain of glass ... an unexampled structure ... like a sea of glass when the waves are settling and smoothing down after a storm.\\" The King of Saxony compared it to \\"A tropical scene with a glass sky.\\" The Great Conservatory was demolished after World War I as all the plants had died as it had not been heated during the war, and the cost of running became too much. Another large glasshouse at Barbrook, on the edge of the park, was devoted to cultivation of the giant Amazon water lily, Victoria amazonica, which flowered in captivity there for the first time. This Lily House has also been lost. =Modern garden (1950‚Äìpresent)= The South Front and the South Lawn with the Seahorse Fountain. The exterior steps are a 19th- century replacement for the original horseshoe-shaped steps. The 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Dukes made few changes to the garden. The garden suffered during World War II, but the 11th Duke and his wife were keen gardeners and oversaw a revival in its fortunes. British gardening personality Alan Titchmarsh wrote in 2003: \\"Chatsworth's greatest strength is that its owners have refused to let the garden rest on its Victorian laurels. It continues to grow and develop, and that is what makes it one of the best and most vibrant gardens in Britain.\\" Many of the historical features have been restored to an immaculate condition, and unusually for an English country house garden in modern times, numerous important new features have been added including: *The South Lawn limes were double rows of pleached red-twigged limes on either side of the South Lawn, which were planted in 1952 and removed in 2014. *The Serpentine Hedge is a wavy hedged yew corridor that leads from the Ring Pond to the bust of the 6th Duke. It was planted in 1953. *The Maze was planted with 1,209 yews in the centre of the site of the former Great Conservatory in 1962. Two flower gardens occupy the rest of the site. *The Display Greenhouse (1970) is in a modern style, but is unobtrusively sited behind the First Duke's greenhouse. It has three climate zones, tropical, Mediterranean and temperate. Public access is limited but groups may book tours and there are first-come-first- served tours on a few days each season. *The Cottage Garden was inspired by an exhibit at the 1988 Chelsea Flower Show. A front garden of flower beds bordered by box leads to the \\"kitchen/dining\\" room with furniture covered with plants. There is a bedroom in the same style on the upper level. *The Kitchen Garden is a productive fruit and vegetable garden with decorative features. It was created behind the stables in the early 1990s. Chatsworth's original kitchen garden covered and was by the river in the park. *Modern sculpture includes various pieces, such as War Horse and Walking Madonna by Dame Elizabeth Frink, and 14 bronze portrait heads by Angela Conner. *The Sensory Garden is fully accessible to the disabled and features many fragrant plants. It was opened in 2004 by the then Home Secretary David Blunkett. *Quebec is a part of the garden to the south and west of the canal pond that was, until 2006, a neglected and dank area covered with Rhododendron ponticum. This is now an extension to the Arboretum walk with a path that runs along the top of the steep bank. The new walk gives views out into the south park, across the River Derwent and up the hill towards New Piece wood. An 18th-century cascade was uncovered during the clearance. =Stables= The stable block 1758‚Äì67 by James Paine The stable block at Chatsworth is prominently situated on the rising ground to the north-east of the house. Its entrance gate features four Doric columns with rusticated banding, a pediment containing a huge carving of the family coat of arms, two life-size stags in embellished with real antlers, and a clock tower topped by a cupola. The building was designed by James Paine for the 4th Duke and was built in 1758‚Äì67. It is approximately square and is two storeys tall. There are low towers in the corners in addition to the one over the entrance gate. The stables originally had stalls for 80 horses, and all necessary equine facilities including a blacksmiths shop. The first floor was occupied by granaries and accommodation for the many stable staff. According to the Dowager Duchess in her book, Chatsworth: The House, one room still has \\"Third Postillion\\" painted on the door. The 6th Duke added a carriage house behind the stables in the 1830s. The last horses left the stables in 1939 and the building was then used as a store and garage. The grooms' accommodation was converted into flats for Chatsworth employees and pensioners and their families. When the house reopened to the public after the war, \\"catering\\" was limited to an outdoor tap, which has since been relabelled \\"water for dogs\\". In 1975 a tea bar was established with an investment of ¬£120. The first attempt at a caf√© opened in 1979. It seated 90 in some old horse stalls in the stables and was not satisfactory; either to the customers or from a commercial point of view. In 1987 the Duke and Duchess's private chef, a Frenchman named Jean-Pierre B√©raud who was also a leading light in the success of the Chatsworth Farm Shop and Chatsworth Foods, took charge of the catering. After a failed attempt to obtain planning permission for a new building incorporating the old ice house in the park, a 250-seat restaurant was created in the carriage house. The 19th-century coach used by the Dowager Duchess and the late Duke at the Queen's Coronation is on display there. Other facilities include The Cavendish Rooms, which also serves refreshments, a shop and three rooms available for hire. The stables cater for thirty thousand people a month during the visitor season. =Park, woods and farmyard= Chatsworth's park covers about and is open to the public free of charge all year-round, except for the south-east section, known as the Old Park, which is not open since it is used for breeding by the herds of red and fallow deer. The attitudes of the Dukes regarding wider access rights have changed significantly over the years. Upon his death, in 2004, the Ramblers Association praised the 11th Duke for his enlightened championing of open access, as well as his apologies for the attitude of the 10th Duke, who had restricted access to much estate land. Even during the 11th Duke's tenure, however, disputes arose‚Äîwhen the definitive rights of way were being compiled in the 1960s and 70s, the footpath to the Swiss Cottage (an isolated house by one of the lakes in the woods) was contested, and the matter went to the High Court, making Derbyshire one of the last counties to settle its definitive maps. The Hunting Tower c.1580 The Bridge 1759‚Äì64 by James Paine Farm stock also graze in the park, many of which belong to tenant farmers or smallholders, who use the park for summer grazing. Bess of Hardwick's park was entirely on the eastern side of the river and only extended as far south as the Emperor Fountain and as far north as the cricket ground. Seven fish ponds were dug to the north-west of the house, where the large, flat area used for events such as the annual Chatsworth Horse Trials and the Country Fair, that is typically held towards the end of August, is now. The bridge across the river was at the southern end of the park and it crossed to the old village of Edensor, which was by the river in full sight of the house. Capability Brown did at least as much work in the park as he did in the garden. The open, tree- flecked landscape that is admired today is man-made. Brown straightened the river, and there is a network of drainage channels under the grass. The park is fertilised with manure from the estates farms and managed to keep weeds and scrub under control. Brown filled in most of the fishponds and extended the park to the west of the river. At the same time James Paine designed the new bridge to the north of the house, which was set at an angle of 40 degrees to command the best view of the West Front of the house. Most of the houses in Edensor were demolished, and the village was rebuilt out of sight of the house. The hedges between the fields on the west bank of the river were grubbed up to create open parkland, and woods were planted on the horizon. These were arranged in triangular clumps so that the screen of trees could be maintained when each planting had to be felled. Brown's plantings reached their peak in the mid-20th century and are gradually being replaced. The 5th Duke had an elegant red-brick inn built at Edensor to accommodate the increasing numbers of well-to-do travellers who were coming to see Chatsworth. It is now the estate office. In 1823 the Bachelor Duke acquired the Duke of Rutland's land around Baslow to the north of Chatsworth in exchange for some land elsewhere. He extended the park around half a mile (800 m) north to its present boundary. He also had the remaining cottages from the old Edensor inside the park demolished apart from the home of one old man who did not wish to move, which still stands in isolation in the park today. The houses in Edensor were rebuilt in picturesque pattern-book styles. In the 1860s the 7th Duke had St Peter's Church, Edensor enlarged by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The church's spire embellishes the views from the house, garden and park, and inside there is a remarkable monument to Bess of Hardwick's sons Henry Cavendish and William, 1st Earl of Devonshire. St Peter's in Edensor is also where the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Duke of Devonshire and their wives are buried. Their remains are not entombed in a vault inside the church but lie, marked by simple headstones, in individual graves in the Cavendish family plot overlooking the churchyard. On the hills of the eastern side of the park there is Stand Wood, where the Hunting Tower is located, that was built in 1582 by Bess of Hardwick. At the top of Stand Wood there is a plateau covering several square miles by lakes, woods and moorland. There are public paths through the area and Chatsworth offers guided tours with commentary in a 28-seater trailer pulled by a tractor. This area is the source of the water for all the gravity-fed waterworks in the garden. The Swiss Lake feeds the Cascade and the Emperor Lake feeds the Emperor Fountain. The Bachelor Duke had an aqueduct built, over which water tumbles on its way to the cascade. The late Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, was a keen advocate of rural life, and in 1973 the Chatsworth Farmyard exhibit was opened in the old building yard above the stables. The aim was to explain to those unfamiliar with rural life how food was produced. There are milking demonstrations and displays of rare breeds. An adventure playground was added in 1983, and a venue for talks and exhibitions called Oak Barn was opened by television gardener Alan Titchmarsh in 2005. Chatsworth also runs two annual rural-skills weeks during which demonstrations of agricultural and forestry are given to groups of schoolchildren on the estate farms and woods. Estate Weir on the River Derwent at the Chatsworth estate Chatsworth is the hub of a agricultural estate. The Chatsworth estate, together with around Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire (mostly moorland) and some land in Eastbourne, belongs to The Trustees of Chatsworth Settlement, a family trust established in 1946. The Duke and other members of the family are entitled to the income. The family's Lismore Castle estate in Ireland is held in a separate trust. The estate includes dozens of tenanted farms and over 450 houses and flats. There are five sub-estates scattered across Derbyshire: *The Main Estate is a compact block of around the house, including the park and many properties in the villages of Baslow, Pilsley, Edensor, Beeley, and Calton Lees. *The West Estate is of scattered high ground, mostly in the Peak District and partly in Staffordshire. Hartington, from which the family takes its secondary title is nearby. *The Shottle Estate is in and around Shottle, which is around south of Chatsworth. This low-lying land is home to most of the dairy farms on the estate, and also has some arable farms. *The Staveley Estate is at Staveley near Chesterfield, including a industrial site called Staveley Works‚Äîwhich is let to various tenants‚Äîsome woodlands, and arable farms. *The Scarcliffe Estate, mostly arable farms, is east of Chesterfield. The Chatsworth Settlement has a wide range of sources of income in addition to agricultural rents. Several thousand acres of the estate, mostly around Chatsworth and on the Staveley estate, are farmed in hand. A number of properties may be rented as holiday cottages, including Bess of Hardwick's Hunting Tower in the park. Several quarries produce limestone and other minerals. The 11th Duke and Duchess did not opt for the \\"theme park\\" approach to modernising a country estate, but they did eschew the traditional aristocratic reluctance to participate in commerce. The Chatsworth Farm Shop is a large enterprise in the UK, employing over a hundred people. A 90-seat restaurant opened at the Farm Shop in 2005. From 1999 to 2003 there was also a shop in the exclusive London district of Belgravia, but it was not successful and closed down. The Settlement also runs the four shops and the catering operations at Chatsworth, paying a percentage of turnover to the charitable Chatsworth House Trust, in lieu of rent. It also runs the Devonshire Arms Hotel and the Devonshire Fell Hotel & Bistro on the Bolton Abbey estate, and it owns the Cavendish Hotel at Baslow, on the edge of Chatsworth Park, which is let to a tenant. The old kitchen garden at Barbrook on the edge of the park is let to the Caravan Club, and a paddock at the southern end of the park where bucks used to be fattened for Chatsworth's table is a tenanted garden centre. In both cases the Settlement receives a percentage of turnover as rent. There is also a line of Chatsworth branded foods, endorsed with the Dowager Duchess's signature, which is available by mail order. The Dowager Duchess also established Chatsworth Design to exploit intellectual property rights to the Devonshire collections, and a furniture company called Chatsworth Carpenters, but the latter has now been licensed to an American company.

V√°zquez de Coronado had hoped to reach the Cities of C√≠bola, often referred to now as the mythical Seven Cities of Gold, which is a term not invented until American gold-rush days in the 1800s. His expedition marked the first European sightings of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River, among other landmarks. His name is often Anglicized as \\"Vasquez de Coronado\\" or just \\"Coronado\\". Early life V√°zquez de Coronado was born into a noble family in Salamanca, in 1510 as the second son of Juan V√°zquez de Coronado y Sosa de Ulloa and Isabel de Luj√°n. Juan V√°zquez held various positions in the administration of the recently captured Emirate of Granada under √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, its first Christian governor. Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado went to New Spain (present-day Mexico) in 1535 at about age 25, in the entourage of its first Viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, the son of his father's patron and V√°zquez de Coronado's personal friend. In New Spain, he married twelve-year- old Beatriz de Estrada, called \\"the Saint\\" (la Santa), sister of Leonor de Estrada, ancestor of the de Alvarado family and daughter of Treasurer and Governor Alonso de Estrada y Hidalgo, Lord of Pic√≥n, and wife Marina Flores Guti√©rrez de la Caballer√≠a, from a converso Jewish family.estrada1 V√°zquez de Coronado inherited a large portion of a Mexican encomendero estate through Beatriz and had eight children by her. Expedition =Preparation= V√°zquez de Coronado was the Governor of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia (New Galicia), a province of New Spain located northwest of Mexico and comprising the contemporary Mexican states of Jalisco, Sinaloa and Nayarit. In 1539, he dispatched Friar Marcos de Niza and Estevanico (more properly known as Estevan), a survivor of the Narv√°ez expedition, on an expedition north from Compostela toward present-day New Mexico. When de Niza returned, he told of a city of vast wealth, a golden city called C√≠bola, whose Zuni residents were assumed to have murdered Estevan. Though he did not claim to have entered the city of C√≠bola, he mentioned that it stood on a high hill and that it appeared wealthy and as large as Mexico City. V√°zquez de Coronado assembled an expedition with two components. One component carried the bulk of the expedition's supplies, traveling via the Guadalupe River under the leadership of Hernando de Alarc√≥n.Winship. pp. 39‚Äì40 The other component traveled by land, along the trail on which Friar Marcos de Niza had followed Esteban. V√°zquez de Coronado and Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza invested large sums of their own money in the venture. Mendoza appointed V√°zquez de Coronado the commander of the expedition, with the mission to find the mythical Seven Cities of Gold. This is the reason he pawned his wife's estates and was lent 70,000 pesos. In the autumn of 1539, Mendoza ordered Melchior D√≠az, commander of the Spanish outpost at San Miguel de Culiac√°n, to investigate Friar de Niza's findings, and on November 17, 1539, D√≠az departed for C√≠bola with fifteen horsemen.Winship. p. 38 At the ruins of Chichilticalli, he turned around because of \\"snows and fierce winds from across the wilderness\\". D√≠az had encountered V√°zquez de Coronado before he had departed San Miguel de Culiac√°n, and reported that initial investigations into Friar de Niza's report disproved the existence of the bountiful land he had described. D√≠az's report was delivered to Viceroy Mendoza on March 20, 1540. =Expedition= The Coronado Expedition (1540‚Äì1542) from Mexico north to the future southwestern United States and east through the modern states of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas Coronado Sets Out to the North (Frederic Remington, c. 1900) V√°zquez de Coronado set out from Compostela on February 23, 1540, at the head of a much larger expedition composed of about 400 European men-at-arms (mostly Spaniards), 1,300 to 2,000 Mexican Indian allies, four Franciscan friars (the most notable of whom were Juan de Padilla and the newly appointed provincial superior of the Franciscan order in the New World, Marcos de Niza), and several slaves, both natives and Africans.Winship. pp. 32‚Äì4, 37 Many other family members and servants also joined the party. He followed the Sinaloan coast northward, keeping the Gulf of California on his left to the west until he reached the northernmost Spanish settlement in Mexico, San Miguel de Culiac√°n, about March 28, 1540, whereupon he rested his expedition before they began trekking the inland trail.Winship. pp. 38, 40 Aside from his mission to verify Friar de Niza's report, Melchior D√≠az had also taken notice of the forage and food situation along the trail, and reported that the land along the route would not be able to support a large concentrated body of soldiers and animals. V√°zquez de Coronado, therefore, decided to divide his expedition into small groups and time their departures so that grazing lands and water holes along the trail could recover. At intervals along the trail, V√°zquez de Coronado established camps and stationed garrisons of soldiers to keep the supply route open. For example, in September 1540, Melchior D√≠az, along with \\"seventy or eighty of the weakest and least reliable men\\" in V√°zquez de Coronado's army, remained at the town of San Hieronimo, in the valley of Corazones, or Hearts.Winship. p. 60 Once the scouting and planning was done, V√°zquez de Coronado led the first group of soldiers up the trail. They were horsemen and foot soldiers who were able to travel quickly, while the main bulk of the expedition would set out later. After leaving Culiacan on April 22, 1540, V√°zquez de Coronado followed the coast, \\"bearing off to the left\\", as Mota Padilla says, by an extremely rough way, to the Sinaloa River. The configuration of the country made it necessary to follow the river valley until he could find a passage across the mountains to the course of the Yaqui River. He traveled alongside this stream for some distance, then crossed to the Rio Sonora, which he followed nearly to its source before a pass (now known as Montezuma Pass) was discovered. On the southern side of the Huachuca Mountains he found a stream he called the Nexpa, which may have been either the Santa Cruz or the San Pedro in modern Arizona of modern maps, most likely the northward-flowing San Pedro River. The party followed this river valley until they reached the edge of the wilderness, where, as Friar Marcos had described it to them, they found Chichilticalli.Winship. pp. 40‚Äì41 Chichilticalli is in southern Arizona in the Sulphur Springs Valley, within the bend of the Dos Cabezas and Chiricahua Mountains. This fits the chronicle of Laus Deo description, which reports that \\"at Chichilticalli the country changes its character again and the spiky vegetation ceases. The reason is that ... the mountain chain changes its direction at the same time that the coast does. Here they had to cross and pass the mountains in order to get into the level country.\\"Winship. p. 143 There V√°zquez de Coronado met a crushing disappointment: C√≠bola was nothing like the great golden city that de Niza had described. Instead, it was just a village of simple pueblos constructed by the Zuni Native Americans. The soldiers were upset with de Niza for his mendacious imagination, so V√°zquez de Coronado sent him back south to New Spain in disgrace. Despite what is shown in the accompanying map, on-the-ground research by Nugent Brasher beginning in 2005 revealed evidence that V√°zquez de Coronado traveled north between Chichilticalli and Zuni primarily on the future New Mexico side of the state line, not the Arizona side as has been thought by historians since the 1940s.Flint, Richard and Flint, Shirley Cushing, eds. The Latest Word from 1540. Albuquerque: U New Mexico Press, 2011, 229‚Äì261 Also, most scholars believe Quivira was about thirty miles east of the great bend of the Arkansas River, ending about twenty miles west-southwest of the location depicted on the map, with Quivira being mostly on tributaries of the Arkansas River instead of directly on the Kansas River.Flint and Flint, Documents of the Coronado Expedition. Albuquerque: U New Mexico Press, 2012, p. 602 For details, see the heading below, \\"Location of Quivira....\\" Conquest of C√≠bola The Coronado Expedition, 1540‚Äì1542 (DjVu format) V√°zquez de Coronado traveled north on one side or the other of today's Arizona‚ÄìNew Mexico state line, and from the headwaters of the Little Colorado River, he continued on until he came to the Zuni River. He followed the Zuni until he found the region inhabited by the Zuni people. The members of the expedition were almost starving and demanded entrance into the village of Hawikuh (of which the preferred Zuni word is Hawikku). The natives refused, denying the expedition entrance to the village. V√°zquez de Coronado and his expeditionaries attacked the Zunis. The ensuing skirmish constituted the extent of what can be called the Spanish \\"Conquest of C√≠bola\\". During the battle, V√°zquez de Coronado was injured. He never personally led his men-at-arms in any subsequent battles. During the weeks that the expedition stayed at Zuni, he sent out several scouting expeditions. The first scouting expedition was led by Pedro de Tovar. This expedition headed northwest to the Hopi villages, which they recorded as Tusayan. Upon arrival, the Spanish were also denied entrance to the village that they came across and, once again, resorted to using force to enter. Materially, the Hopi region was just as poor as the Zuni in precious metals, but the Spaniards did learn that a large river (the Colorado) lay to the west. Exploration of the Colorado River Three leaders affiliated with the V√°zquez de Coronado expedition were able to reach the Colorado River. The first was Hernando de Alarc√≥n, then Melchior D√≠az and lastly Garcia Lopez de C√°rdenas. Alarc√≥n's fleet was tasked to carry supplies and to establish contact with the main body of V√°zquez de Coronado's expedition but was unable to do so because of the extreme distance to Cibola. He traveled up the Sea of Cort√©s and then the Colorado River. In this exploration, he hauled some supplies for V√°zquez de Coronado, but eventually, he buried them with a note in a bottle. Melchior D√≠az was sent down from C√≠bola by V√°zquez de Coronado to take charge of the camp of Corazones and to establish contact with the fleet. Soon after arriving at the camp he set out from the valley of Corazones in Sonora and traveled overland in a north/northwesterly direction until he arrived at the junction of the Colorado River and Gila River. There the local natives, probably the CocoMaricopa (see Seymour 2007b), told him that Alarc√≥n's sailors had buried supplies and left a note in a bottle. The supplies were retrieved, and the note stated that Alarc√≥n's men had rowed up the river as far as they could, searching in vain for the V√°zquez de Coronado expedition. They had given up and decided to return to their departure point because worms were eating holes in their boats. D√≠az named the river the \\"Firebrand (Tiz√≥n) River\\" because the natives in the area used firebrands to keep their bodies warm in the winter. D√≠az died on the trip back to the camp in the valley of the Corazones. La conquista del Colorado, by Augusto Ferrer- Dalmau, depicts Coronado's 1540‚Äì1542 expedition While at Hawikuh, V√°zquez de Coronado sent another scouting expedition overland to find the Colorado River, led by Don Garcia L√≥pez de C√°rdenas. The expedition returned to Hopi territory to acquire scouts and supplies. Members of C√°rdenas's party eventually reached the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, where they could see the Colorado River thousands of feet below, becoming the first Europeans to do so. After trying and failing to climb down into the canyon to reach the river, the expedition reported that they would not be able to use the Colorado River to link up with Hernando de Alarc√≥n's fleet. After this, the main body of the expedition began its journey to the next populated center of pueblos, along another large river to the east, the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Tiguex War Hernando de Alvarado was sent to the east, and found several villages around the Rio Grande. V√°zquez de Coronado had one commandeered for his winter quarters, Coofor, which is across the river from present-day Bernalillo near Albuquerque, New Mexico. During the winter of 1540‚Äì41, his army found themselves in conflict with the Rio Grande natives, which led to the brutal Tiguex War.Herrick, Dennis. Winter of the Metal People: The Untold Story of America's First Indian War. Mechanicsburg, PA: Sunbury Press, 2013. This war resulted in the destruction of the Tiguex pueblos and the deaths of hundreds of Native Americans. Search for Quivira From an Indian the Spanish called \\"the Turk\\" (el turco), V√°zquez de Coronado heard of a wealthy civilization called Quivira far to the east. In the Spring of 1541 he led his army and priests and Indian allies onto the Great Plains to search for Quivira. The Turk was probably either a Wichita or a Pawnee and his intention seems to have been to lead V√°zquez de Coronado astray and hope that he got lost in the wilderness. With the Turk guiding him, V√°zquez de Coronado and his army might have crossed the flat and featureless steppe called the Llano Estacado in the Texas Panhandle and Eastern New Mexico, passing through the present-day communities of Hereford and Canadian. The Spanish were awed by the Llano. \\"The country they [the buffalo] traveled over was so smooth that if one looked at them the sky could be seen between their legs.\\" Men and horses became lost in the featureless plain and V√°zquez de Coronado felt like he had been swallowed up by the sea.Winship, George Parker (Ed. and Translator) The Journey of Coronado, 1540‚Äì1542, from the City of Mexico to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado and the Buffalo Plains of Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska, As Told by Himself and his Followers. New York: A.S. Barnes & Co, 1904, 142‚Äì215 On the Llano, V√°zquez de Coronado encountered vast herds of bison‚Äîthe American buffalo. \\"I found such a quantity of cows ... that it is impossible to number them, for while I was journeying through these plains ... there was not a day that I lost sight of them.\\"Winship, 214 Querechos and Teyas V√°zquez de Coronado found a settlement of people he called Querechos. The Querechos were not awed or impressed by the Spanish, their weapons, and their \\"big dogs\\" (horses). \\"They did nothing unusual when they saw our army, except to come out of their tents to look at us, after which they came to talk to the advance guard, and asked who we were.\\"Winship, 65 As V√°zquez de Coronado described them, the Querechos were nomads, following the buffalo herds on the plains. The Querechos were numerous. Chroniclers mentioned one settlement of two hundred tipis‚Äîwhich implies a population of more than one thousand people living together for at least part of the year. Authorities agree that the Querechos (Becquerel's) were Apache Indians.Riley, Carroll L., Rio del Norte, Salt Lake City: U of Utah Press, 1995, 190 V√°zquez de Coronado as depicted at the Deaf Smith County Historical Museum in Hereford, Texas V√°zquez de Coronado left the Querechos behind and continued southeast in the direction in which the Turk told him that Quivira was located. He and his army descended off the tabletop of the Llano Estacado into the caprock canyon country. He soon met with another group of Indians, the Teyas, enemies of the Querechos. The Teyas, like the Querechos, were numerous and buffalo hunters, although they had additional resources. The canyons they inhabited had trees and flowing streams and they grew or foraged for beans, but not corn. The Spanish, however, did note the presence of mulberries, roses, grapes, walnuts, and plums.Winship, 70 An intriguing event was V√°zquez de Coronado's meeting among the Teyas an old blind bearded man who said that he had met many days before \\"four others like us\\". He was probably talking about Cabeza de Vaca, who with Esteban and two other Spanish survivors of the Narv√°ez expedition to Florida made his way across southern Texas six years before V√°zquez de Coronado.Winship, 232 Scholars differ in their opinions as to which historical Indian group were the Teyas. A plurality believe they were Caddoan speakers and related to the Wichita.Flint, Richard. No Settlement, No Conquest, Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 2008, 157. For a contrary view, see Riley, 191‚Äì192 The place where V√°zquez de Coronado found the Teyas has also been debated. The mystery may have been cleared up‚Äîto the satisfaction of some‚Äîby the discovery of a likely V√°zquez de Coronado campsite. While V√°zquez de Coronado was in the canyon country, his army suffered one of the violent climatic events so common on the plains. \\"A tempest came up one afternoon with a very high wind and hail ... The hail broke many tents and tattered many helmets, and wounded many of the horses, and broke all the crockery of the army, and the gourds which was no small loss.\\"Winship, 69‚Äì70 In 1993, Jimmy Owens found crossbow points in Blanco Canyon in Crosby County, Texas, near the town of Floydada in Floyd County. Archaeologists subsequently searched the site and found pottery sherds, more than forty crossbow points, and dozens of horseshoe nails of Spanish manufacture, plus a Mexican-style stone blade. This find strengthens the evidence that V√°zquez de Coronado found the Teyas in Blanco Canyon.Flint, Richard and Flint, Shirley Cushing, eds. The Coronado Expedition to Tierra Nueva. Niwot, CO: U Press of CO, 1997, 372‚Äì375 Quivira Another guide, probably Pawnee and named Ysopete, and probably Teyas as well told V√°zquez de Coronado that he was going in the wrong direction, saying Quivira lay to the north. By this time, V√°zquez de Coronado seems to have lost his confidence that fortune awaited him. He sent most of his expedition back to New Mexico and continued with only forty Spanish soldiers and priests and an unknown number of Indian soldiers, servants, and guides. V√°zquez de Coronado, thus, dedicated himself to a reconnaissance rather than a mission of conquest. After more than thirty days journey, V√°zquez de Coronado found a river larger than any he had seen before. This was the Arkansas, probably a few miles east of present-day Dodge City, Kansas. The Spaniards and their Indian allies followed the Arkansas northeast for three days and found Quivirans hunting buffalo. The Indians greeted the Spanish with wonderment and fear but calmed down when one of V√°zquez de Coronado's guides addressed them in their own language. V√°zquez de Coronado reached Quivira itself after a few more days of traveling. He found Quivira \\"well settled ... along good river bottoms, although without much water, and good streams which flow into another\\". V√°zquez de Coronado believed that there were twenty-five settlements in Quivira. Both men and women Quivirans were nearly naked. V√°zquez de Coronado was impressed with the size of the Quivirans and all the other Indians he met. They were \\"large people of very good build\\".Winship, 113, 209, 215, 234‚Äì237 V√°zquez de Coronado spent twenty-five days among the Quivirans trying to learn of richer kingdoms just over the horizon. He found nothing but straw-thatched villages of up to two hundred houses and fields containing corn, beans, and squash. A copper pendant was the only evidence of wealth he discovered. The Quivirans were almost certainly the ancestors of the Wichita people.Bolton, 293 and many subsequent scholars \\"Episode from the Conquest of America\\" by Jan Mostaert (c. 1545), probably V√°zquez de Coronado in New Mexico V√°zquez de Coronado was escorted to the further edge of Quivira, called Tabas, where the neighboring land of Harahey began. He summoned the \\"Lord of Harahey\\" who, with two hundred followers, came to meet with the Spanish. He was disappointed. The Harahey Indians were \\"all naked ‚Äì with bows, and some sort of things on their heads, and their privy parts slightly covered\\".Winship, 235 They were not the wealthy people V√°zquez de Coronado sought. Disappointed, he returned to New Mexico. Before leaving Quivira, V√°zquez de Coronado ordered the Turk garroted (executed). The Turk is regarded as an Indian hero in a display at Albuquerque's Indian Pueblo Cultural Center because he led V√°zquez de Coronado onto the Great Plains and thus relieved the beleaguered pueblos of Spanish depredations for at least a few months. =Location of Quivira, Tabas, and Harahey= Archaeological evidence suggests that Quivira was in central Kansas with the western-most village near the small town of Lyons on Cow Creek, extending twenty miles east to the Little Arkansas River, and north another twenty miles to the town of Lindsborg on a tributary of the Smoky Hill River. Tabas was likely on the Smoky Hill River. Archaeologists have found numerous 16th-century sites in these areas that probably include some of the settlements visited by V√°zquez de Coronado. At Harahey \\"was a river, with more water and more inhabitants than the other\\". This sounds as if V√°zquez de Coronado may have reached the Smoky Hill River near Salina or Abilene. It is a larger river than either Cow Creek or the Little Arkansas and is located at roughly the 25 league distance from Lyons that V√°zquez de Coronado said he traveled in Quivira. The people of Harahey seem Caddoan, because \\"it was the same sort of a place, with settlements like these, and of about the same size\\" as Quivira. They were probably the ancestors of the Pawnee.Winship, 235; Wedel, Waldo R., \\"Archeological Remains in Central Kansas and their Possible Bearing on the Location of Quivira\\". Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 101, No. 7, 1942, 1‚Äì24. Wedel lays the foundation for the location of Quivira, built on by many subsequent investigators. =Expedition end= V√°zquez de Coronado returned to the Tiguex Province in New Mexico from Quivira and was badly injured in a fall from his horse \\"after the winter was over\\", according to the chronicler Casta√±eda‚Äîprobably in March 1542. During a long convalescence, he and his expeditionaries decided to return to New Spain (Mexico). V√°zquez de Coronado and his expedition departed New Mexico in early April 1542, leaving behind two friars.Bolton, Herbert E. Coronado: Knight of Pueblo and Plains, Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1949, 330‚Äì334 His expedition had been a failure. Although he remained governor of Nueva Galicia until 1544, the expedition forced him into bankruptcy and resulted in charges of war crimes being brought against him and his field master, C√°rdenas. V√°zquez de Coronado was cleared by his friends on the Audiencia, but C√°rdenas was convicted in Spain of basically the same charges by the Council of the Indies. V√°zquez de Coronado remained in Mexico City, where he died of an infectious disease on September 22, 1554.Bolton, 406 He was buried under the altar of the Church of Santo Domingo in Mexico City. V√°zquez de Coronado caused a large loss of life among the Puebloans, both from the battles he fought with them in the Tiguex War and from the demands for food and clothing that he levied on their fragile economies. However, thirty-nine years later when the Spanish again visited the Southwestern United States, they found little evidence that V√°zquez de Coronado had any lasting cultural influences on the Indians except for their surprise at seeing several light-skinned and light-haired Puebloans. See: The Chamuscado and Rodriguez Expedition and Antonio de Espejo. Legacy In 1952, the United States established Coronado National Memorial near Sierra Vista, Arizona to commemorate his expedition. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade references the \\"Cross of Coronado\\". According to the film, this gold cross, discovered in a Utah cave system, was given to V√°zquez de Coronado by Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1521. Such an event never happened because V√°zquez de Coronado would have been 11 or 12 years old in 1521 and still living in Spain. In addition, when Indy captures the cross from robbers aboard a ship off the coast of Portugal, the ship can be seen to be named The Coronado. In 1992, underground found-footage filmmaker Craig Baldwin made the film \\"O No Coronado!\\" detailing the expedition of V√°zquez de Coronado through the use of recycled images from Westerns, conquest films, and The Lone Ranger television series. The song Hitchin' to Quivira from independent singer-songwriter Tyler Jakes's 2016 album Mojo Suicide is based on the story of V√°zquez de Coronado's expedition. The song Coronado And The Turk from singer-songwriter Steve Tilston's 1992 album Of Moor And Mesa is based on the story of V√°zquez de Coronado's expedition. There is a large hill just northwest of Lindsborg, Kansas, that is called Coronado Heights. The former owner of the land built a small castle atop the hill to commemorate V√°zquez de Coronado's 1541 visit to the area. The castle and the area around it is now a public camping and recreation area. The soft sandstone rocks at the peak of the hill are covered in the names of past visitors to the area. Coronado High Schools in Lubbock, Texas, El Paso, Texas, Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Scottsdale, Arizona, were named for V√°zquez de Coronado. Because a don is a name for a Spanish nobleman, the Coronado Don became the school mascot in Scottsdale. Bernalillo, New Mexico, calls itself the \\"City of Coronado\\" because he stayed there for two winters. Coronado Center, a two-story indoor shopping mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico is named after V√°zquez de Coronado. Coronado Road in Phoenix, Arizona, was named after V√°zquez de Coronado. Similarly, Interstate 40 through Albuquerque has been named the Coronado Freeway. Coronado, California is not named after Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado, but is named after Coronado Islands, which were named in 1602 by Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no who called them Los Cuatro Coronados (the four crowned ones) to honor four martyrs.Chauncey Adams, History of Coronado The mineral Coronadite is named after him. Family Within a year of arriving in New Spain, he married Beatriz de Estrada, called \\"the saint\\". Beatriz was the second daughter of Alonso de Estrada and Marina de la Caballer√≠a; niece of Diego de Caballeria. The Estrada-Coronado union was a carefully calculated political union that Francisco and Marina orchestrated. Through this marriage, Francisco became a wealthy man. Beatriz brought to the marriage the encomienda of Tlapa, the third largest encomienda in New Spain. This marriage was an important source of funding for Francisco's expedition.

Beatriz reported that her husband had died in great poverty, since their encomiendas had been taken away from them due to the New Laws, and that she and her daughters lived in misery too, a shame for the widow of a conqueror that had provided such valuable service to his majesty. This, as most reports from the early days of New Spain, both positive and negative and regarding all things, have been proven to be false, part of the power struggles among settlers and attempts to exploit the budding new system that tried to find a way to administer justice in land the king could not see nor the army reach. Francisco, Beatriz and their children actually ended their days comfortably.Shirley Cushing Flint \\"No Mere Shadows: Faces of Widowhood in Early Colonial Mexico\\" University of New Mexico Press 2013 pp 40 Ancestors References Sources * Winship, George Parker, translator and editor (1990) The Journey of Coronado 1540‚Äì1542.

In brief, this technique makes use of the Stark effect (or electrochromism) either to reveal information about the physiochemical or physical properties of a sample using a well-characterized electric field or to reveal information about an electric field using a reference sample with a well-characterized Stark effect. The use of the term \\"Stark effect\\" differs between the disciplines of chemistry and physics. Physicists tend to use the more classical definition of the term (see Stark effect), while chemists usually use the term to refer to what is technically electrochromism.Liptay, W. Berichte der Bunsengesellschaft f√ºr physikalische Chemie. 1974, 80, 207-217.; Liptay, W. Excited States. 129-159. In the former case, the applied electric field splits the atomic energy levels and is the electric field analog of the Zeeman effect. However, in the latter case, the applied electric field changes the molar absorption coefficient of the sample, which can be measured using traditional absorption or emission spectroscopic methods. This effect is known as electrochromism.

Published in 1852, the novel had a profound effect on attitudes toward African Americans and slavery in the U.S. and is said to have \\"helped lay the groundwork for the Civil War\\". Stowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, featured the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of other characters revolve. The sentimental novel depicts the reality of slavery while also asserting that Christian love can overcome something as destructive as enslavement of fellow human beings.Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Spark Publishers, 2002, p. 19, states the novel is about the \\"destructive power of slavery and the ability of Christian love to overcome it...\\"Laurie E.

De Rosa quotes Jane Tompkins that Stowe's strategy was to destroy slavery through the \\"saving power of Christian love.\\" This quote is from \\"Sentimental Power: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Politics of Literary History\\" by Jane Tompkins, from In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction, 1790‚Äì1860.

In that essay, Tompkins also writes: \\"Stowe conceived her book as an instrument for bringing about the day when the world would be ruled not by force, but by Christian love.\\" Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century and the second best-selling book of that century, following the Bible.\\"The Sentimental Novel: The Example of Harriet Beecher Stowe\\" by Gail K.

The quote is apocryphal; it did not appear in print until 1896, and it has been argued that \\"The long-term durability of Lincoln's greeting as an anecdote in literary studies and Stowe scholarship can perhaps be explained in part by the desire among many contemporary intellectuals ... to affirm the role of literature as an agent of social change.\\" The book and the plays it inspired helped popularize a number of stereotypes about black people.Hulser, Kathleen. \\"Reading Uncle Tom's Image: From Anti-slavery Hero to Racial Insult.\\" New-York Journal of American History 2003 65(1): 75‚Äì79. . These include the affectionate, dark-skinned \\"mammy\\"; the \\"pickaninny\\" stereotype of black children; and the \\"Uncle Tom\\", or dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress. In recent years, the negative associations with Uncle Tom's Cabin have, to an extent, overshadowed the historical impact of the book as a \\"vital antislavery tool.\\"Henry Louis Gates, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Africana: Arts and Letters: An A-to-Z Reference of Writers, Musicians, and Artists of the African American Experience, Running Press, 2005, p. 544. Sources Stowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, wrote the novel as a response to the passage, in 1850, of the second Fugitive Slave Act. Much of the book was composed in Brunswick, Maine, where her husband, Calvin Ellis Stowe, taught at his alma mater, Bowdoin College. An engraving of Harriet Beecher Stowe from 1872, based on an oil painting by Alonzo Chappel Stowe was partly inspired to create Uncle Tom's Cabin by the slave narrative The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself (1849). Henson, a formerly enslaved black man, had lived and worked on a 3,700-acre (15 km) tobacco plantation in North Bethesda, Maryland, owned by Isaac Riley.Susan Logue, \\"Historic Uncle Tom's Cabin Saved\\" , VOA News, January 12, 2006. Retrieved December 24, 2011. Henson escaped slavery in 1830 by fleeing to the Province of Upper Canada (now Ontario), where he helped other fugitive slaves settle and become self-sufficient, and where he wrote his memoirs. Stowe acknowledged in 1853 that Henson's writings inspired Uncle Tom's Cabin.Harriet Beecher Stowe, A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin 1853, p. 42, in which Stowe states: \\"A last instance parallel with that of Uncle Tom is to be found in the published memoirs of the venerable Josiah Henson]...\\" This also is cited in Debra J. Rosenthal, A Routledge Literary Sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Routledge, 2003, pp. 25‚Äì26. When Stowe's work became a best-seller, Henson republished his memoirs as The Memoirs of Uncle Tom and traveled on lecture tours extensively in the United States and Europe. Stowe's novel lent its name to Henson's home‚ÄîUncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site, near Dresden, Ontario, Canada‚Äîwhich since the 1940s has been a museum. The cabin where Henson lived while he was enslaved no longer exists, but a cabin on the Riley farm erroneously thought to be the Henson Cabin was purchased by the Montgomery County, Maryland, government in 2006.Annys Shin, \\"After buying historic home, Md. officials find it wasn't really Uncle Tom's Cabin\\", The Washington Post, October 3, 2010. It is now a part of the National Park Service National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program,Official Montgomery Parks Josiah Henson Park site and plans are underway to build a museum and interpretive center on the site. American Slavery as It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses, a volume co-authored by Theodore Dwight Weld and the Grimk√© sisters, is also a source of some of the novel's content.The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001‚Äì2005. Stowe said she based the novel on a number of interviews with people who escaped slavery during the time when she was living in Cincinnati, Ohio, across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state. In Cincinnati the Underground Railroad had local abolitionist sympathizers and was active in efforts to help runaway slaves on their escape route from the South. Stowe mentioned a number of the inspirations and sources for her novel in A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin (1853). This non-fiction book was intended to verify Stowe's claims about slavery.The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi- Media Archive. Retrieved April 20, 2007. However, later research indicated that Stowe did not read many of the book's cited works until after she had published her novel. Publication First appearance of Uncle Tom's Cabin as serialized in The National Era (June 5, 1851) Uncle Tom's Cabin first appeared as a 40-week serial in The National Era, an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter narrative that would run for only a few weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that several protests were sent to the Era office when she missed an issue. Because of the story's popularity, the publisher John P. Jewett contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read Uncle Tom's Cabin in book form, she eventually consented to the request. Convinced the book would be popular, Jewett made the unusual decision (for the time) to have six full-page illustrations by Hammatt Billings engraved for the first printing.First Edition Illustrations, Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 18, 2007. Published in book form on March 20, 1852, the novel sold 3,000 copies on that day alone, and soon sold out its complete print run.

Plot =Eliza escapes with her son; Tom sold \\"down the river\\"= Full-page illustration by Hammatt Billings for the first edition of Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). Eliza tells Uncle Tom that he has been sold and she is running away to save her child. The book opens with a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing the loss of his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent relationship with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them‚ÄîUncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza‚Äîto Mr. Haley, a coarse slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor. When Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby discussing plans to sell Tom and Harry, Eliza determines to run away with her son. The novel states that Eliza made this decision because she fears losing her only surviving child (she had already miscarried two children). Eliza departs that night, leaving a note of apology to her mistress. As Tom is sold, Mr. Haley takes him to a riverboat on the Mississippi River and from there Tom is to be transported to a slave market. While on board, Tom meets Eva, an angelic little white girl and quickly they become friends. Eva falls into the river and Tom dives into the river to save her life. Being grateful to Tom, Eva's father Augustine St. Clare buys him from Haley and takes him with the family to their home in New Orleans. Tom and Eva begin to relate to one another because of the deep Christian faith they both share. =Eliza's family hunted; Tom's life with St. Clare= Illustration of Tom and Eva by Hammatt Billings for the 1853 deluxe edition of Uncle Tom's Cabin During Eliza's escape, she meets up with her husband George Harris, who had run away previously. They decide to attempt to reach Canada. However, they are tracked by Tom Loker, a slave hunter hired by Mr. Haley. Eventually Loker and his men trap Eliza and her family, causing George to shoot him in the side. Worried that Loker may die, Eliza convinces George to bring the slave hunter to a nearby Quaker settlement for medical treatment. Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery with his Northern cousin Ophelia who, while opposing slavery, is prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, believes he is not biased, even though he is a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her. After Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she experiences a vision of heaven, which she shares with the people around her. As a result of her death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to throw off her personal prejudices against blacks, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Tom. =Tom sold to Simon Legree= Before St. Clare can follow through on his pledge, however, he dies after being stabbed outside a tavern. His wife reneges on her late husband's vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious plantation owner named Simon Legree. Tom is taken to rural Louisiana with other new slaves including Emmeline whom Simon Legree has purchased to use as a sex slave.

Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Legree beats Tom viciously and resolves to crush his new slave's faith in God. Despite Legree's cruelty, however, Tom refuses to stop reading his Bible and comforting the other slaves as best he can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another slave whom Legree used as sex slave. Cassy tells her story to Tom. She was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold. She became pregnant again but killed the child as she could not stand to have another child separated from her. At this point Tom Loker returns to the story. Loker has changed as the result of being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also obtained their freedom as Tom Loker helped them to cross over into Canada from Lake Erie. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late. =Final section= On their boat ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris' sister Madame de Thoux and accompany her to Canada. Madame de Thoux and George Harris were separated in their childhood. Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was sold as a child. Now that their family is together again, they travel to France and eventually Liberia, the African nation created for former American slaves. George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm, where after his father's death, he frees all his slaves. George Shelby urges them to remember Tom's sacrifice every time they look at his cabin. He decides to lead a pious Christian life just as Uncle Tom did. Major characters =Uncle Tom= Simon Legree assaults Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom, the title character, was initially seen as a noble, long-suffering Christian slave. In more recent years, however, his name has become an epithet directed towards African-Americans who are accused of selling out to whites. Stowe intended Tom to be a \\"noble hero\\"Debra J. Rosenthal, A Routledge Literary Sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Routledge, 2003, p. 31. and praiseworthy person. Throughout the book, far from allowing himself to be exploited, Tom stands up for his beliefs and is grudgingly admired even by his enemies. =Eliza= Eliza is a slave and personal maid to Mrs. Shelby who escapes to the North with her five-year-old son Harry after he is sold to Mr. Haley. Her husband, George, eventually finds Eliza and Harry in Ohio and emigrates with them to Canada, then France and finally Liberia. The character Eliza was inspired by an account given at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowe's husband Calvin, a professor at the school. According to Rankin, in February 1838 a young slave woman, Eliza Harris, had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley with her child in her arms and stayed at his house on her way further north.Hagedorn, Ann. Beyond The River: The Untold Story of the Heroes of the Underground Railroad. Simon & Schuster, 2002, pp. 135‚Äì139. =Eva= Uncle Tom and Little Eva, painting by Edwin Longsden Long (1866) Evangeline St. Clare is the daughter of Augustine St. Clare. Eva enters the narrative when Uncle Tom is traveling via steamship to New Orleans to be sold, and he rescues the five- or six-year-old girl from drowning. Eva begs her father to buy Tom, and he becomes the head coachman at the St. Clare house. He spends most of his time with the angelic Eva. Eva often talks about love and forgiveness, convincing the dour slave girl Topsy that she deserves love. She even touches the heart of her Aunt Ophelia. Eventually Eva falls terminally ill. Before dying, she gives a lock of her hair to each of the slaves, telling them that they must become Christians so that they may see each other in Heaven. On her deathbed, she convinces her father to free Tom, but because of circumstances the promise never materializes. A similar character, also named Little Eva, later appeared in the children's novel Little Eva: The Flower of the South by Philip J. Cozans‚Äîalthough this ironically was an anti-Tom novel. =Simon Legree= Simon Legree on the cover of the comic book adaptation of Uncle Tom's Cabin (Classic Comics No.15, November 1943) Simon Legree is a cruel slave owner‚Äîa Northerner by birth‚Äîwhose name has become synonymous with greed. He is arguably the novel's main antagonist. His goal is to demoralize Tom and break him of his religious faith; he eventually orders Tom whipped to death out of frustration for his slave's unbreakable belief in God. The novel reveals that, as a young man, he had abandoned his sickly mother for a life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed. He sexually exploits Cassy, who despises him, and later sets his designs on Emmeline. It is unclear if Legree is based on any actual individuals. Reports surfaced after the 1870s that Stowe had in mind a wealthy cotton and sugar plantation owner named Meredith Calhoun, who settled on the Red River north of Alexandria, Louisiana. Generally, however, the personal characteristics of Calhoun (\\"highly educated and refined\\") do not match the uncouthness and brutality of Legree. Calhoun even edited his own newspaper, published in Colfax (originally \\"Calhoun's Landing\\"), which was renamed The National Democrat after Calhoun's death. However, Calhoun's overseers may have been in line with the hated Legree's methods and motivations. Other characters These are the more notable of the secondary and minor characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin: * Arthur Shelby ‚Äì Tom's master in Kentucky. Shelby is characterized as a \\"kind\\" slaveowner and a stereotypical Southern gentleman. * Emily Shelby ‚Äì Arthur Shelby's wife. She is a deeply religious woman who strives to be a kind and moral influence upon her slaves and is appalled when her husband sells his slaves to a slave trader. As a woman, she has no legal way to stop this, as all property belongs to her husband. * George Shelby ‚Äì Arthur's and Emily's son, who sees Tom as a friend and as the perfect Christian. * Chloe ‚Äì Tom's wife and mother of his children. * Augustine St. Clare ‚Äì Tom's third owner and father of Eva. St. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit. After a rocky courtship he marries a woman he grows to hold in contempt, though he is too polite to let it show. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but is not willing to relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing. * Marie St. Clare ‚Äì Wife of Augustine, she is a self-absorbed woman without a hint of compassion for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom. * George Harris ‚Äì Eliza's husband. An intelligent and clever half-white slave who is fiercely loyal to his family. * Harry ‚Äì Eliza's son. He is supposed to be sold to Mr. Haley by Mr. Arthur Shelby. Eva and Topsy, an 1852 literary poster by British lithographer Louise Corbaux * Topsy ‚Äì A young slave girl. When asked if she knows who made her, she professes ignorance of both God and a mother, saying \\"I s'pect I growed. Don't think nobody never made me.\\" She is transformed by Eva's love. During the early-to-mid 20th century, several doll manufacturers created Topsy and Topsy-type dolls. The phrase \\"growed like Topsy\\" (later \\"grew like Topsy\\") passed into the English language, originally with the specific meaning of unplanned growth, later sometimes just meaning enormous growth. The Word Detective , issue of May 20, 2003. Retrieved February 16, 2007. * Miss Ophelia ‚Äì Augustine St. Clare's pious, hard- working, abolitionist cousin from Vermont. She displays the ambiguities towards African-Americans felt by many Northerners at the time. She argues against the institution of slavery yet, at least initially, feels repulsed by the slaves as individuals. * Cassy ‚Äì A light-skinned (quadroon) slave on Legree's plantation who has been sexually exploited by Legree. She is an embittered woman, pent on revenge, though somewhat softened by Uncle Tom's Christian faith. After Uncle Tom's death, she takes nonviolent revenge on Legree, suggesting to him that a building on his plantation is haunted, and thus contributing to his death. She is able to escape with Emmeline, a young slave girl, and finally finds her long-lost daughter, Eliza. * Prue ‚Äì A depressed slave who was forced to let her child starve to death. She takes up drinking in her misery, and is ultimately beaten and killed for it. * Quimbo and Sambo ‚Äì slaves of Simon Legree who act as overseers of the plantation. On orders from Legree, they savagely whip Tom but afterward tearfully repent of their deeds to Tom, who forgives them as he lies dying. * Mr. Haley ‚Äì A coarse slave trader who buys slaves from Mr. Arthur Shelby. * Tom Loker ‚Äì A slave hunter hired by Mr. Haley to catch Eliza and her son Harry. Major themes \\"The fugitives are safe in a free land.\\" Illustration by Hammatt Billings for Uncle Tom's Cabin, first edition. The image shows George Harris, Eliza, Harry, and Mrs. Smyth after they escape to freedom. Uncle Tom's Cabin is dominated by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery.Homelessness in American Literature: Romanticism, Realism, and Testimony by John Allen, Routledge, 2004, p. 24, where it states in regards to Uncle Tom's Cabin that \\"Stowe held specific beliefs about the 'evils' of slavery and the role of Americans in resisting it.\\" The book then quotes Ann Douglas describing how Stowe saw slavery as a sin. While Stowe weaves other subthemes throughout her text, such as the moral authority of motherhood and the redeeming possibilities offered by Christianity, she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery. Stowe sometimes changed the story's voice so she could give a \\"homily\\" on the destructive nature of slaveryDrawn With the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War by James Munro McPherson, Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 30. (such as when a white woman on the steamboat carrying Tom further south states, \\"The most dreadful part of slavery, to my mind, is its outrages of feelings and affections‚Äîthe separating of families, for example.\\").Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Vintage Books, Modern Library Edition, 1991, p. 150. One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery was how this \\"peculiar institution\\" forcibly separated families from each other.James Munro McPherson, Drawn With the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War, Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 29. One of the subthemes presented in the novel is temperance. Stowe made it somewhat subtle and in some cases she weaved it into events that would also support the dominant theme. One example of this is when Augustine St. Clare is killed, he attempted to stop a brawl between two inebriated men in a cafe and was stabbed. One other example is the death of the slave woman Prue who was whipped to death for being drunk on a consistent basis; however, her reasons for doing so is due to the loss of her baby. In the opening of the novel, the fates of Eliza and her son are being discussed between slave owners over wine. Considering that Stowe intended this to be a subtheme, this scene could foreshadow future events that put alcohol in a bad light. Because Stowe saw motherhood as the \\"ethical and structural model for all of American life\\"Elizabeth Ammons, \\"Stowe's Dream of the Mother-Savior: Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Women Writers Before the 1920s\\", in Eric J.

Through characters like Eliza, who escapes from slavery to save her young son (and eventually reunites her entire family), or Eva, who is seen as the \\"ideal Christian\\",Somatic Fictions: imagining illness in Victorian culture by Athena Vrettos, Stanford University Press, 1995, p. 101. Stowe shows how she believed women could save those around them from even the worst injustices. While later critics have noted that Stowe's female characters are often domestic clich√©s instead of realistic women,Mason I. Lowance, Jr., Ellen E. Westbrook, R. C. De Prospo, The Stowe Debate: Rhetorical Strategies in Uncle Tom's Cabin, University of Massachusetts Press, 1994, p. 132. Stowe's novel \\"reaffirmed the importance of women's influence\\" and helped pave the way for the women's rights movement in the following decades.Linda Eisenmann, Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States, Greenwood Press, 1998, p. 3. Stowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching theme‚Äîthe exploration of the nature of Christianity and how she feels Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.David L. Larsen, The Company of the Creative: A Christian Reader's Guide to Great Literature and Its Themes, Kregel Publications, 2000, pp. 386‚Äì387. This theme is most evident when Tom urges St. Clare to \\"look away to Jesus\\" after the death of St. Clare's beloved daughter Eva. After Tom dies, George Shelby eulogizes Tom by saying, \\"What a thing it is to be a Christian.\\"Larsen, The Company of the Creative (2000), p. 387.

Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: \\"I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing Uncle Tom's Cabin. I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child.\\"Janet Badia and Jennifer Phegley, Reading Women: Literary Figures and Cultural Icons from the Victorian Age to the Present, University of Toronto Press, 2005, p. 67.

Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name. Despite this positive reaction from readers, for decades literary critics dismissed the style found in Uncle Tom's Cabin and other sentimental novels because these books were written by women and so prominently featured \\"women's sloppy emotions.\\"Rosenthal, A Routledge Literary Sourcebook on Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (2003), p. 42.

However, in 1985 Jane Tompkins expressed a different view of Uncle Tom's Cabin with her book In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction. Tompkins praised the style so many other critics had dismissed, writing that sentimental novels showed how women's emotions had the power to change the world for the better. She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century, including Uncle Tom's Cabin, were remarkable for their \\"intellectual complexity, ambition, and resourcefulness\\"; and that Uncle Tom's Cabin offers a \\"critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better-known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville.\\" This view remains the subject of dispute. Writing in 2001, legal scholar Richard Posner described Uncle Tom's Cabin as part of the mediocre list of canonical works that emerges when political criteria are imposed on literature.Posner, R., Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline, Harvard University Press (2002), p. 239. .

Upon publication, Uncle Tom's Cabin ignited a firestorm of protest from defenders of slavery (who created a number of books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature. =Contemporary and world reaction= Stowe responded to criticism by writing A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin (1853), documenting the veracity of her novel's depiction of slavery.

The novel was also roundly criticized by slavery supporters. Acclaimed Southern novelist William Gilmore Simms declared the work utterly false,\\"Simms's Review of Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" by Charles S. Watson, American Literature, Vol. 48, No. 3 (November 1976), pp. 365‚Äì368 while others called the novel criminal and slanderous.Alfred L. Brophy, \\"Over and above ...

Reactions ranged from a bookseller in Mobile, Alabama, being forced to leave town for selling the novel to threatening letters sent to Stowe (including a package containing a slave's severed ear). Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe's novel.Joseph V. Ridgely, \\"Woodcraft: Simms's First Answer to Uncle Tom's Cabin\\", American Literature, Vol. 31, No. 4 (January 1960), pp. 421‚Äì433. Some critics highlighted Stowe's paucity of life- experience relating to Southern life, saying that it led her to create inaccurate descriptions of the region. For instance, she had never been to a Southern plantation. However, Stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in Cincinnati. It is reported that \\"She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed on the Ohio River, including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the emerging plot.\\"The Classic Text: Harriett Beecher Stowe. University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Library. Special collection page on traditions and interpretations of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Retrieved May 15, 2007. In response to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, an attempt to document the veracity of the novel's depiction of slavery. In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin and cites \\"real life equivalents\\" to them while also mounting a more \\"aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had.\\" Like the novel, A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin was a best-seller. However, while Stowe claimed A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin documented her previously consulted sources, she actually read many of the cited works only after the publication of her novel. A major part of the Key was Stowe's critique of how the legal system supported slavery and licensed owners' mistreatment of slaves. Thus, Stowe put more than slavery on trial; she put the law on trial. This continued an important theme of Uncle Tom's Cabin‚Äîthat the shadow of law brooded over the institution of slavery and allowed owners to mistreat slaves and then avoid punishment for their mistreatment. In some cases, as Stowe pointed out, it even prevented kind owners from freeing their slaves. Despite these criticisms, the novel still captured the imagination of many Americans. According to Stowe's son, when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln commented, \\"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\\" Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made.Uncle Tom's Cabin, introduction by Amanda Claybaugh, Barnes and Noble Classics, New York, 2003, p. xvii. Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement. Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement. A. M.

The scene‚Äîa runaway black slave and child attacked by dogs‚Äîwas inspired by Uncle Tom's Cabin. Uncle Tom's Cabin also created great interest in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, \\"The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance [of slavery], but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America‚Äîwe are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system‚Äîour Tories hate her democrats‚Äîour Whigs hate her parvenus‚Äîour Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy.\\"Nassau Senior, quoted in Ephraim Douglass Adams, Great Britain and the American Civil War (1958), p. 33. Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed.\\"Charles Francis Adams, Trans-Atlantic Historical Solidarity: Lectures Delivered before the University of Oxford in Easter and Trinity Terms, 1913, 1913, p. 79. Stowe sent a copy of the book to Charles Dickens, who wrote her in response: \\"I have read your book with the deepest interest and sympathy, and admire, more than I can express to you, both the generous feeling which inspired it, and the admirable power with which it is executed.\\" The historian and politician Thomas Babington Macaulay wrote in his diary, in 1852: \\"I finished 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' a powerful and disagreeable book; too dark and Spagnoletto-like for my taste, when considered as a work of art. But on the whole, it is the most valuable addition that America has made to English literature.\\" A French edition, translated by M. L. Carion (or by [Anne-]Louise Swanton-Belloc?, 1796‚Äì1881), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris.Its title was La Case de l'Oncle Tom, ou Sort des n√®gres esclaves.

See also which disagrees as to the translators name ‚Äì perhaps Carion was a pseudonym. By 1857, the novel had been translated into 20 languages, including two independent translations into Slovene just one year after its original publication, which started the since- then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers. Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and Amharic (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation).Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University Press, 1968), p. 122. The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado- masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.Gibson, Ian, The English Vice: Beating, Sex and Shame in Victorian England and After (1978) The passage which seems most likely to have interested them is the start of chapter 29. A short article which was published in the official newspaper of the Salvadoran government on July 22, 1853 praised Harriet Beecher Stowe and her book's success. Influenced by the literature of protest, Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei, current leader of Islamic Republic of Iran, addressing a number of Iranian intellectuals, remembered the novel as one of the most tragic works in the modern world depicting a morbid history of slavery in America. =Literary significance and criticism= As the first widely read political novel in the United States,Tompkins, Jane.

See chapter five, \\"Sentimental Power: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Politics of Literary History.\\" Uncle Tom's Cabin greatly influenced development of not only American literature but also protest literature in general. Later books which owe a large debt to Uncle Tom's Cabin include The Jungle by Upton Sinclair and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.Cindy Weinstein, The Cambridge Companion to Harriet Beecher Stowe, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 13. Despite this undisputed significance, Uncle Tom's Cabin has been called \\"a blend of children's fable and propaganda.\\" The novel has also been dismissed by a number of literary critics as \\"merely a sentimental novel,\\" while critic George Whicher stated in his Literary History of the United States that \\"Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel's enormous vogue; its author's resources as a purveyor of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable. She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos, and of these popular sentiments she compounded her book.\\" Other critics, though, have praised the novel. Edmund Wilson stated that \\"To expose oneself in maturity to Uncle Tom's Cabin may therefore prove a startling experience. It is a much more impressive work than one has ever been allowed to suspect.\\" Jane Tompkins states that the novel is one of the classics of American literature and wonders if many literary critics dismiss the book because it was simply too popular during its day. Uncle Tom and Eva, mass-market Staffordshire figure, England, 1855‚Äì1860, glazed and painted earthenware Over the years scholars have postulated a number of theories about what Stowe was trying to say with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel.Smylie, James H. \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin Revisited: the Bible, the Romantic Imagination, and the Sympathies of Christ.\\" American Presbyterians 1995 73(3): 165‚Äì175. . Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris?Bellin, Joshua D. \\"Up to Heaven's Gate, down in Earth's Dust: the Politics of Judgment in Uncle Tom's Cabin\\", American Literature 1993 65(2): 275‚Äì295.

Scholars have also seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the Free Will Movement.Grant, David, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Triumph of Republican Rhetoric\\", New England Quarterly 1998 71(3): 429‚Äì448.

In this view, the character of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During the course of the novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (three years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles. Feminist theory can also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a critique of the patriarchal nature of slavery.Riss, Arthur. \\"Racial Essentialism and Family Values in Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" American Quarterly 1994 46(4): 513‚Äì544. Fulltext in JSTOR. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society. The book has also been seen as an attempt to redefine masculinity as a necessary step toward the abolition of slavery.Wolff, Cynthia Griffin. \\"Masculinity in Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\" American Quarterly 1995 47(4): 595‚Äì618. .

In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other. George Orwell is his essay \\"Good Bad Books\\", first published in Tribune on 2 November 1945, claims that \\"perhaps the supreme example of the 'good bad' book is Uncle Tom's Cabin. It is an unintentionally ludicrous book, full of preposterous melodramatic incidents; it is also deeply moving and essentially true; it is hard to say which quality outweighs the other.\\" But he concludes \\"I would back Uncle Tom's Cabin to outlive the complete works of Virginia Woolf or George Moore, though I know of no strictly literary test which would show where the superiority lies.\\" James Baldwin described Uncle Tom's Cabin as, \\"a bad novel, having, in its self-righteousness, virtuous sentimentality\\". He argued that the novel lacked psychological depth, and that Stowe, \\"was not so much a novelist as an impassioned pamphleteer\\". Creation and popularization of stereotypes Illustration of Sam from the 1888 \\"New Edition\\" of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The character of Sam helped create the stereotype of the lazy, carefree \\"happy darky\\". Some modern scholars and readers have criticized the book for condescending racist descriptions of the black characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate.Smith; Jessie Carney; Images of Blacks in American Culture: A Reference Guide to Information Sources Greenwood Press. 1988. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the bookIllustrations, Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive. Retrieved April 18, 2007. and associated stage productions) was accused of playing a major role in permanently ingraining such stereotypes into the American psyche. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Black Power and Black Arts Movements attacked the novel, claiming that the character of Uncle Tom engaged in \\"race betrayal\\", and that Tom made slaves out to be worse than slave owners. Among the stereotypes of blacks in Uncle Tom's Cabin are the \\"happy darky\\" (in the lazy, carefree character of Sam); the light- skinned tragic mulatto as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); the affectionate, dark-skinned female mammy (through several characters, including Mammy, a cook at the St. Clare plantation); the pickaninny stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); the Uncle Tom, an African American who is too eager to please white people. Stowe intended Tom to be a \\"noble hero\\" and a Christ-like figure who, like Jesus at his crucifixion, forgives the people responsible for his death. The false stereotype of Tom as a \\"subservient fool who bows down to the white man\\", and the resulting derogatory term \\"Uncle Tom\\", resulted from staged \\"Tom Shows\\", which sometimes replaced Tom's grim death with an upbeat ending where Tom causes his oppressors to see the error of their ways, and they all reconcile happily. Stowe had no control over these shows and their alteration of her story. These negative associations have to some extent obscured the historical impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin as a \\"vital antislavery tool\\". James Baldwin, in a 1949 essay \\"Everybody's Protest Novel\\", called Uncle Tom's Cabin a \\"very bad novel\\" ... \\"ruined by its \\"self-righteous, virtuous sentimentality\\", and stated that Stowe was less a novelist than an \\"impassioned pamphleteer\\", i.e., a propagandist for the antislavery cause.Edward Rothstein, \\"Digging Through the Literary Anthropology of Stowe's Uncle Tom\\", The New York Times, October 23, 2006. Edward Rothstein has claimed that Baldwin missed the point and that the purpose of the novel was \\"to treat slavery not as a political issue but as an individually human one ‚Äì and ultimately a challenge to Christianity itself\\"; as a propaganda work it need not necessarily be great literature in order to succeed in its goals. In recent years, however, scholars such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. have re-examined Uncle Tom's Cabin, stating that the book is a \\"central document in American race relations and a significant moral and political exploration of the character of those relations\\". Anti-Tom literature Title page for Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Eastman, one of many examples of anti-Tom literature In response to Uncle Tom's Cabin, writers in the Southern United States produced a number of books to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a childlike peopleLinda Williams, Playing the Race Card: Melodramas of Black and White from Uncle Tom to O. J. Simpson, Princeton University Press, 2001, p. 113. unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.Joy Jordan-Lake, Whitewashing Uncle Tom's Cabin: nineteenth-century women novelists respond to Stowe, Vanderbilt University Press, 2005. Among the most famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz, with the last author having been a close personal friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published a few months after Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a Northern woman‚Äîthe daughter of an abolitionist, no less‚Äîwho marries a Southern slave owner. In the decade between the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin and the start of the American Civil War, between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published. Among these novels are two books titled Uncle Tom's Cabin as It Is (one by W. L. Smith and the other by C. H. Wiley) and a book by John Pendleton Kennedy. More than half of these anti-Tom books were written by white women, with Simms commenting at one point about the \\"Seemingly poetic justice of having the Northern woman (Stowe) answered by a Southern woman.\\"Henry Louis Gates, Figures in Black: words, signs, and the \\"racial\\" self, Oxford University Press, 1987, p. 134. \\"Professional racist\\" Thomas Dixon Jr. saw a dramatic version of the novel and, feeling that it was unfair to the South, wrote The Leopard's Spots (1902) as a reply. He uses characters from Stowe's work: Simon Legree, George Harris, Tim (for Arthur) and George Shelby, and Tom, converted into Tom Camp, a white former Confederate soldier. Dixon is a key figure in popularizing the myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. Dramatic adaptations =Plays and Tom shows= Even though Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story as a stage play or musical than read the book.\\"People & Events: Uncle Tom's Cabin Takes the Nation by Storm\\" , Stephen Foster ‚Äì The American Experience, PBS.

Eric Lott, in his book Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production, estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, ten times the book's first-year sales. Given the lax copyright laws of the time, stage plays based on Uncle Tom's Cabin‚Äî\\"Tom shows\\"‚Äîbegan to appear while the novel was still being serialized. Stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her work because of her distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see George L. Aiken's version and, according to Francis Underwood, was \\"delighted\\" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy).Lott, Eric, Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class.

Retrieved June 30, 2012. Stowe's refusal to authorize a particular dramatic version left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures. No international copyright laws existed at the time. The book and plays were translated into several languages; Stowe received no money, which could have meant as much as \\"three-fourths of her just and legitimate wages.\\" All of the Tom shows appear to have incorporated elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy.Henry Louis Gates, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Africana: arts and letters: an A-to-Z reference of writers, musicians, and artists of the African American Experience, Running Press, 2005, p. 44. These plays varied tremendously in their politics‚Äîsome faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery. Many of the productions featured demeaning racial caricatures of Black people, while a number of productions also featured songs by Stephen Foster (including \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\", \\"Old Folks at Home\\", and \\"Massa's in the Cold Ground\\"). The best-known Tom Shows were those of George Aiken and H.J. Conway. The version by Aiken is perhaps the best known stage adaptation, released just a few months after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece.Wilmeth, Don B. (ed.), Staging the Nation: Plays from the American Theater, 1787‚Äì1909. Boston: Bedford Books, 1998, p. 181. Most of Aiken's dialogue was taken verbatim from Stowe's novel, and his adaptation included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard.Aiken, George L. Uncle Tom's Cabin. New York: Garland, 1993. Another legacy of Aiken's version is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film.Gerould, Daniel C. (ed.), American Melodrama. New York: Performing Arts Journal Publications, 1983, p. 16. By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences.Gerould, American Melodrama (1983), p. 14. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery. The many stage variants of Uncle Tom's Cabin \\"dominated northern popular culture... for several years\\" during the 19th century, and the plays were still being performed in the early 20th century. One of the unique and controversial variants of the Tom Shows was Walt Disney's Mickey's Mellerdrammer, a United Artists film released in 1933. The title is a corruption of \\"melodrama\\", thought to harken back to the earliest minstrel shows, as a film short based on a production of Uncle Tom's Cabin by the Disney characters. In that film, Mickey Mouse and friends stage their own production of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Mickey Mouse was already black-colored, but the advertising poster for the film shows Mickey dressed in blackface with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers made out of cotton; and his trademark white gloves. =Films= Uncle Tom's Cabin has been adapted several times as a film.

This version was evidently similar to many of the \\"Tom Shows\\" of earlier decades and featured numerous stereotypes about blacks (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction). In 1910, a three- reel Vitagraph Company of America production was directed by J. Stuart Blackton and adapted by Eugene Mullin. According to The Dramatic Mirror, this film was \\"a decided innovation\\" in motion pictures and \\"the first time an American company\\" released a dramatic film in three reels. Until then, full- length movies of the time were 15 minutes long and contained only one reel of film. The movie starred Florence Turner, Mary Fuller, Edwin R.

The screenplay takes many liberties with the original book, including altering the Eliza and George subplot, introducing the Civil War and Emancipation, and combining the characters of Eliza and Emmeline. Another difference occurs after Tom dies: Simon Legree is haunted by an apparitional vision of the late Tom and falls to his death in a futile effort to attack the ghostly image. Black media outlets of the time praised the film, but the studio‚Äîfearful of a backlash from Southern and white film audiences‚Äîended up cutting out controversial scenes, including the film's opening sequence at a slave auction (in which a mother is torn away from her baby).Thomas Cripps, Slow Fade to Black: The Negro in American Film, 1900‚Äì1942, Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 48.

For several decades after the end of the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation.

It is a part of the Rhenish Massif ( or Rhenish Slate Mountains). Its highest elevation, at 657 m above sea level, is the Fuchskaute in the High Westerwald. Tourist attractions include the (394 metres), site of some Celtic ruins from La T√®ne times (5th to 1st century BC), found in the community of the same name, and Limburg an der Lahn, a town with a mediaeval centre. The geologically old, heavily eroded range of the Westerwald is in its northern parts overlaid by a volcanic upland made of Neogene basalt layers. It covers an area of some , and therefore roughly , making the Westerwald one of Germany's biggest mountain ranges by area. In areas of subsidence, it has in its flatter western part (Lower Westerwald) the characteristics of rolling hills. Typical for the economy of the Upper Westerwald, some 40% of which is actually wooded, are traditional slate mining, clay quarrying, diabase and basalt mining, pottery and the iron ore industry, and among other things mining in the (roughly \\"Siegerland Ore Grounds\\"). Despite its relatively slight elevation, the Westerwald has for a low mountain range a typical agreeable climate. Economically and culturally, it belongs among Germany's best known mountain ranges. The name \\"Westerwald\\" was first mentioned in 1048 in a document from the Electorate of Trier and described at that time the woodlands (Wald is German for \\"forest\\" or \\"woods\\") around the three churches in Bad Marienberg, Rennerod and Emmerichenhain, west of the royal court at Herborn. Only since the mid 19th century has the name come into common usage for the whole range. The High Westerwald has since the Middle Ages formed the heart of the (also or ) (\\"Lordship over the Westerwald\\"). This comprised the three court districts of Marienberg, Emmerichenhain and Neukirch. The Lordship later fell under the governance of the Lordship or County of Beilstein.  Geography  = Location = View of the northern Westerwald from the Otto Turm at Herkersdorf/Kirchen The Westerwald lies mostly southwest of the three-state common point shared by Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia in the districts of Altenkirchen, Lahn-Dill, Limburg-Weilburg, Neuwied, Rhein-Lahn, Rhein-Sieg, Westerwaldkreis and partly in Siegen-Wittgenstein. It is found south of the Rothaargebirge, southwest of the Lahn-Dill-Bergland (another low mountain range), north of the Taunus and east of the Middle Rhine and stretches more or less southwards from Siegen and Burbach, southwestwards from Haiger, northwestwards from Weilburg, northwards from Limburg an der Lahn, northeastwards from Koblenz, eastwards from Linz am Rhein, southeastwards from Wissen and southwards from Betzdorf. In its centre lie Bad Marienberg and Hachenburg. Clockwise, the Westerwald is bordered by the following river valleys: the Rhine between Koblenz and Linz, the Sieg as far as Betzdorf, the Heller, the Dill and from its mouth near Wetzlar, the Lahn up to Lahnstein. Geomorphologically, the Westerwald belongs to the Rhenish Massif, which forms the greater part of that range's eastern half on the Rhine's right bank. Likewise, the Gladenbach Uplands, lying east of the Dill, also belong to the Westerwald, whereas the mountains reaching up to near the Haiger Saddle () and east of Siegen are counted as part of the Rothaargebirge. = The Westerwald's regions = The Westerwald is divided by elevation into these three regions: * Unterer or Vorderer Westerwald, or Vorderwesterwald: : Translated here as Lower Westerwald, this region borders on the Rhine and Lahn river valley landscapes and manifests itself as the western and southwestern part of the Westerwald, a heavily truncated upland with elevations ranging from 200 to 400 m. The subsidence areas found within (Dierdorfer Senke, Montabaurer Senke) are known for their clay deposits. Indeed, the name for this small region is the Kannenb√§ckerland, or \\"Jug Bakers‚Äô Land\\", a reference to the traditional ceramics industry here. In the southwest, in the richly wooded Montabaur Heights (Montabaurer H√∂he) is found a monadnock made of quartzite, as well as the Malberg Conservation Area (Naturschutzgebiet Malberg). The Siebengebirge joining the range in the northwest near Bonn (reaching 464 m) is, however, regionally grouped with the Middle Rhine area. * Oberer Westerwald: : Translated here as Upper Westerwald, this is a partly wooded land of volcanic crests with major basalt layers, above all in the area of the Westerwald Lake Plateau (Westerw√§lder Seenplatte), with elevations ranging from some 350 to 500 m. To the south, as part of the Lahn valley, the hilly Limburg Basin abuts the Upper Westerwald. * Hoher Westerwald: :The High Westerwald is an undulating and basalt-rich tableland decked with woodlands, making for a highly moderated microclimate, especially against extreme warmth. It ranges from roughly 450 to 657 m in height. Here is found the Fuchskaute, the highest peak. = Places = District seats in the Westerwald are: Altenkirchen (Altenkirchen district), Montabaur (Westerwaldkreis) and Neuwied (Neuwied district). Furthermore, the Lahn-Dill-Kreis, the Mayen-Koblenz district, the Rhein-Lahn-Kreis and the Limburg-Weilburg district each have shares of the Westerwald. If Sieg is taken as the Westerwald's northernmost limit, then the Rhein-Sieg district likewise belongs here, at least in parts (for example the Siebengebirge and the communities of Eitorf and Windeck). = Transport connections = The Westerwald and its outer edges are crossed by stretches of 8, 42, 49, 54, 62, 255, 256, 277, 413 and 414, over which there are connections to the Autobahnen A 3 (Cologne‚ÄìFrankfurt), A 45 (Dortmund‚ÄìAschaffenburg) and A 48\\\\. The most notable railway is the Cologne- Frankfurt high-speed rail line with minor stops at Montabaur and Limburg an der Lahn. The High Westerwald is served by Siegerland Airport for private use and special touristic charters, south of Burbach.  Geology  Basalt columns at the Hummelsberg Geologically, the Westerwald is part of the Rhenish Massif, and likewise represents a heavily eroded remnant of a great Variscan mountain system which in the Mesozoic characterized a great deal of Europe. The Devonian bedrock is covered by volcanic masses from the Tertiary, particularly basalt and tuffs. Economically important, besides slate, limestone and clay quarrying, were, and still are, iron and its processing industry between Rheintal (Unkel, Linz) and the lower Wied, pumice gravel in the Neuwied Basin, various mineral springs and, once, brown coal mining. The whole Westerwald region lay under a tropically warm arm of the sea in the Palaeozoic (600 to 270 million years ago). This sea deposited layers of sediments many kilometres thick into the Variscan geosyncline, which were heavily folded in the orogeny that followed. The towns of Siegen and Koblenz on the Westerwald's north and southwest edges even gave two Lower Devonian layers, with their colourful slates, their names. The upper mountain layers are formed of volcanic strata made of basalt containing tuffs. Typical everyday Westerwald pottery In a few areas, slate and clay have long been quarried, the latter notably in the so- called Kannenb√§ckerland, but also in a few other places where the clay is worked into the salt-glazed grey Westerwald Pottery with cobalt blue decoration. The pottery industry is centred on H√∂hr-Grenzhausen. Exports, particularly to Italy, are also important (more than one million metric tons each year). In the mid 16th century, potters from Raeren in Belgium migrated into the Westerwald, bringing with them some of their moulds. This type of pottery was taken to the New World and was found in the early Chesapeake settlements. Today one finds not only highly crafted moulded vases and mugs but also a range of handcrafted utility ware, with hand-painted swirling floral motifs. In the eastern Westerwald (the part lying in Hesse) are found interesting limestone deposits from the most varied of geological times. Erdbach limestone from the Lower Carboniferous gave one small time period the name \\"Erdbachian\\". Near Breitscheid are found the remnants of an atoll from the subtropical Devonian sea that was here 380,000,000 years ago. Parts of this limestone formation are worked in open-pit mining; near Enspel, a \\"fossil conservation area\\" has been instituted, in which institutes from several colleges conduct research and excursions. A few karst caves are of interest to spelaeology and bring about the temporary disappearance and reappearance of the Erdbach.  Mountains  The Westerwald's highest mountain is the Fuchskaute in the High Westerwald, meaning \\"fox hollow\\". Many peaks and crests exceed the 600-metre level. Sorted by elevation above sea level, these are some of the Westerwald's highest elevations: * Fuchskaute (657 m), near Willingen, Westerwaldkreis, Rhineland-Palatinate * Stegskopf (654 m), near Emmerzhausen, Altenkirchen district, Rhineland-Palatinate * Salzburger Kopf (653 m), near Salzburg, Westerwaldkreis, Rhineland-Palatinate * H√∂llberg (643 m), near Driedorf, Lahn-Dill-Kreis, Hesse * Auf der Baar (618 m), near Driedorf/Breitscheid, Lahn-Dill-Kreis, Hesse * Barstein (614 m), near Breitscheid, Lahn-Dill-Kreis, Hesse * Knoten (605 m), near Driedorf, Lahn- Dill-Kreis, Hesse * Die H√∂h (598 m), near Burbach, Siegen-Wittgenstein, North Rhine-Westphalia * Alarmstange (542.2 m), near Horresen, Westerwaldkreis, Rhineland-Palatinate * K√∂ppel (540 m), near Montabaur, Westerwaldkreis, Rhineland-Palatinate * Hohenseelbachskopf (530 m), near Daaden, Siegen- Wittgenstein and Altenkirchen district, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland- Palatinate * Gr√§bersberg (513.1 m), near Alpenrod, Westerwaldkreis, Rhineland- Palatinate * Mahlscheid (509 m), near Herdorf, Siegen-Wittgenstein and Altenkirchen district, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate * Malberg (422 m), near √ñtzingen, Westerwaldkreis, Rhineland-Palatinate * Hummelsberg (389 m), near Linz am Rhein, Neuwied district, Rhineland- Palatinate * Beulskopf (388 m), near Altenkirchen, Altenkirchen district, Rhineland-Palatinate File:Westerwald H√∂llberg.jpgH√∂llberg File:Blick vom Knoten.jpgView from the Knoten File:Hummelsberg (Westerwald).jpgHummelsberg File:Oetzingen-Malberg.jpgMalberg  Waterways  = Flowing waters = The following are the Westerwald's rivers and streams: * Rivers whose valley systems border the range (clockwise):  Rhine ‚Äì southwest edge  Sieg ‚Äì north edge  Dill ‚Äì east edge, tributary to the Lahn  Lahn ‚Äì southeast edge * Smaller rivers within the range:  Mehrbach  Sayn (also known as Saynbach) ‚Äì in the southern (Lower) Westerwald, flows west to the Rhine  Wied (between Sieg und Sayn) ‚Äì flows west to the Rhine  Nister (in the northeast, boundary of Upper Westerwald) ‚Äì flows northwest to the Sieg  Elbbach (Sieg) ‚Äì near Wissen to the Sieg  Heller ‚Äì rises in northern Westerwald and flows through the Siegerland to Betzdorf and into the Sieg  Elbbach (Lahn) ‚Äì near Ailertchen to the Lahn  Daade ‚Äì empties between Alsdorf and Gr√ºnebach into the Heller * Greater streams and brooks:  Aubach, Brexbach, Dietzh√∂lze, Erdbach, Fockenbach, Gelbach, Hellerbach, Holzbach, Kerkerbach, Masselbach, Ulmbach. = Standing waters = * Breitenbach Reservoir (Rennerod) * Driedorf Reservoir * Gro√üer Weiher * Fischweiher * Heisterberger Weiher * Krombach Reservoir * Seeweiher near Mengerskirchen * Waagweiher * Waldsee Maroth * Westerwald Lake District  Brinkenweiher  Dreifelder Weiher (or Seeweiher)  Haidenweiher  Hausweiher  Hofmannsweiher  Postweiher  W√∂lferlinger Weiher * Wiesensee (reservoir) Weiher is a German word meaning \\"pond\\". History =Early times= Through prehistoric finds it can be determined that the Celts settled in the Westerwald and were using the iron ore deposits in the so-called Hallstatt times (Iron Age, roughly 750 to 500 BC). In all likelihood they came into the area from the Hunsr√ºck. From La T√®ne times come the Celtic ringwall-girded defensive and sheltering castles which may be found on, among other peaks, the Malberg. Already by La T√®ne times, Germanic peoples were thrusting in from the east and from the Sieg valley. They came about 380 BC into the Upper Westerwald, bypassing the High Westerwald, seeing it as nothing more than a trackless wooded wilderness, after which they eventually came up against the Rhine in the 2nd century. =Roman times= Even in the time when the Celts found themselves having to avoid the Germanic invaders by moving to the west, the Romans were also pushing in from the Rhine's left bank to the southwest. However, the Romans only managed to seize a strip of land on the Rhine's right bank and the so-called Rhine-Westerwald; the Westerwald itself lay outside the Roman-occupied area, for the Romans preferred to maintain a little-settled, most likely pathless wilderness as their border. =Chatti times= The Westerwald's permanent settlement and thereby its territorial history began with the Chatti (Hessians) pushing their way into the area after the Romans were driven out in the 3rd century. Placename endings such as ‚Äìar, ‚Äìmar and ‚Äìaha (\\"Haigraha\\" = Haiger) stemming from the Migration Period (\\"V√∂lkerwanderung\\") can still be found now. These lie around the forest's outer edges in basins and dales whose soils and climate were favourable to early settlers, and include, for instance, Hadamar, Lahr and Wetzlar. From the 4th to the 6th century, the settlements from the time of the taking of the land arose in formerly pathless areas, taking endings such as ‚Äìingen and ‚Äìheim, like Bellingen and Bladernheim; these lie on the broad, raised plains in the Upper Westerwald. =Frankish times= The Franks built their old settlements on the edge of the Westerwald in the central areas of their districts, to build up slowly and permanently strongholds in the interior. There arose places with names ending in ‚Äìrode, ‚Äìscheid, ‚Äìhahn, ‚Äìberg, ‚Äìtal and ‚Äìseifen. Once clearing settlements had been established and logging for iron ore smelting was under way, the widespread destruction of the forest began.\\"Der Westerwald\\" by Hermann-Josef Roth (DuMont) Between the 6th and 9th centuries came settlement expansion from the old settlements towards the edges, a process still witnessed in placename endings such as ‚Äìhausen, ‚Äìhofen, ‚Äìkirch, ‚Äìburg or ‚Äìtal.\\"Das Westerwaldbuch\\", p. 33 ff. from the Westerwaldverein =Middle Ages= The last settlement period in the Westerwald began in the 10th century and ended about 1300. Through Carolingian policy and therefore the Trier and Cologne mission, this area underwent Christianization. Trier advanced up the Lahn, Cologne to the Rhine and Sieg. Trier-Lothringian and Lower Rhine influences were nevertheless brought into the Westerwald. Among the witnesses to the art of building at that time is the monastery church at Limburg-Dietkirchen, in its oldest parts. After many changes in ownership between the Ottonian and Salian noble families, it was in the end the Counts of Sayn, Diez and Wied who managed to take hold of extensive landholdings. Particular importance was achieved by the Counts of Laurenburg, who later called themselves the Counts of Nassau. In the east, the Landgraves of Hesse put it about that they could beat the Archbishopric of Mainz on the battlefield. Moreover, the Counts of Wied, the Counts of Sayn- Wittgenstein and the Electorate of Trier were all prominent landlords. =Modern times= Political relations were simplified until the 16th century. Among the four greater powers' spheres of influence (Mainz, Cologne, Trier, Hesse), the House of Nassau managed to expand and strengthen its hold on its territory on the Dill between Siegen and Nassau. After the Napoleonic upheavals, Nassau had to share broad swathes of the Westerwald with the newly minted power Prussia. A sovereign Duchy of Nassau existed until it was annexed by Prussia in 1866. Nowadays, the Westerwald is shared among three German federal states: Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate.

The \\"Westerwaldlied\\" is also sung by the Chilean Armed Forces and is known as \\"Himno de la Secci√≥n\\". It is also the inspiration for the South Korean military song, \\"Our Nation Forever\\". In recent years it has become somewhat controversial in Germany due to its origins during the National Socialist era, with the German military ceasing performances of it in 2017.  Other  The standard German term for a Westerwald dweller is Westerw√§lder (; plural: same), but they are also popularly known as Basaltk√∂pp (‚ÄúBasalt Heads‚Äù), as they are said to be thickheaded, and they live in a basalt-rich region. W√§ller is another vernacular name for them. One of the 12 best-rated hiking trails in Germany is the Westerwaldsteig. The Westerwaldsteig crosses the Westerwald from east (Herborn) to west (Rhine).

Set in Thailand, it is the story of a young backpacker's search for a legendary, idyllic and isolated beach untouched by tourism, and his time there in its small, international community of backpackers. In 2000, it was adapted into a film directed by Danny Boyle and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2003, the novel was listed on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\\"BBC - The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003, Retrieved 31 October 2012 Plot summary In a cheap hotel on Khao San Road in Bangkok, Richard, a young British backpacker, meets a mentally disturbed Scots going by the alias of Daffy Duck, who gives him a hand-drawn map with directions to a beautiful island with a hidden lagoon and beach, located in the Gulf of Thailand and inaccessible to tourists. Shortly thereafter, Richard discovers that Daffy has died by suicide. Wanting company in his search, Richard befriends a travelling French couple, √âtienne and Fran√ßoise, and the trio sets out to find what they hope might be an untouched paradise. On their way to the island, Richard gives a copy of the map to Sammy and Zeph, two Americans he meets on Koh Samui. When the three finally reach the hidden beach ‚Äî after bribing a local boat pilot, swimming from an adjacent island, discovering a cannabis plantation in the jungle, and avoiding its armed owners, and eventually jumping over a waterfall ‚Äî they discover a group of approximately 30 backpackers who have largely shut off the outside world to live a slow-paced life of leisure under the de facto leadership of an American woman called Sal and her South African lover Bugs, who, along with Daffy, founded the community there in 1989. They reside in hand-built wooden huts and tents, located near a large, beautiful beach and lagoon that are encircled by cliffs and connected to the sea by underwater caves. When Richard, √âtienne, and Fran√ßoise arrive, it is already 1995, six years after the founders came to the beach. The founders have chosen only a small number of friends and acquaintances to come to the island, and thus newcomers are not welcome, but they are not sent away because doing so would jeopardize the secrecy of the community. The residents fear that if word gets out, the beach will become overrun with tourists and ruined, like many of Thailand's other beauty spots. They are also mindful of upsetting the Thai cannabis farmers, with whom they originally agreed to keep to separate territories but who have more recently warned them not to bring anyone new to the island, as the farmers fear discovery by the police. After initial suspicion, the group accepts the trio when they explain about Daffy's map and his death back on the mainland. As the community aims to be self-sufficient, work is divided into rosters for gardening, fishing, cooking, and carpentry. Richard, Fran√ßoise, and √âtienne become part of the fishing detail. For several months, Richard finds life on the island idyllic, fishing in the mornings and relaxing the rest of the time. He befriends a few other members of the community: Keaty, a fellow English hooked on his Game Boy; Gregorio, a Spaniard on his fishing detail; Unhygienix, the Italian head chef obsessed with soap, as he handles fish every day; Jesse and Cassie, two lovers; Ella, who works second-in-command to Unhygienix; and finally, Jed, the loner of the group whose mysterious job involves going alone into the jungle. Richard later discovers that Sal has assigned Jed to be the island's guardian: He watches the sea and shores of the neighboring islands for any signs of people attempting to discover the beach. Jed also has a sideline of stealing some cannabis from the Thai farmers' side of the island. One day, Unhygienix informs everyone that their rice supply has been infected by a fungus, and Sal announces an emergency rice run ‚Äî an occasional discreet trip to the mainland by boat to bulk-buy rice and other essentials. Due to the laborious nature of the task, no one volunteers for it except Jed, who, to the bewilderment of most others, always takes the job. Richard also volunteers, and so the two travel back to Koh Phangan for their supplies. It is during the rice run that Jed learns that Richard gave a copy of the map to Sammy and Zeph, when Jed coincidentally wanders past and overhears the two Americans relaying the urban legend of the beach to some Germans. The rice run goes without a hitch, but soon, accompanied by three Germans they met on the mainland, Zeph and Sammy make their way to the nearest island to the beach, which worries Richard, as he will be blamed if they successfully reach the community. Soon afterward, Sal reassigns Richard to the perimeter detail to partner with Jed and keep a close eye on the potential invaders. With a free spot in Gregorio's fishing detail, Keaty takes Richard's place. A few days later, he mistakenly catches a dead squid that gives severe food poisoning to most of the group. The few remaining healthy members struggle to nurse the sick residents back to health. Richard returns from his sentry duty to find that Bugs has punched Keaty in the face for his mistake. Richard, having never liked Bugs' arrogant nature, instigates a heated argument with him in front of the whole group, which leads to a division of the community into several cliques. On this day, only two of the fishing details are still in operation, and the best detail, comprising three Swedes ‚Äî Christo, Sten, and Karl ‚Äî who fish outside the safe lagoon area, is attacked by a shark. The camp only finds out about the shark attack upon the return of one of the three, Karl, in the early evening. Karl carries Sten on his back to the village, where Sten is discovered to have already bled to death. While Karl was not physically harmed by the shark, he suffers severe emotional trauma from having watched his friend die. He subsequently spends his time sitting in a dug-out hole on the beach and not talking to anyone, barely accepting food and water. Richard realizes that Christo is still missing and, at his own risk, retrieves him from partially submerged caves of the lagoon. Richard is praised for his heroic rescue of Christo, who at first seems fine but later collapses, owing to the internal bleeding from having been rammed by the shark. Due to Christo's grave wounds, he requires Jed's presence in the camp, because only Jed has the medical knowledge to tend to him. This leaves Richard to work the sentry detail alone. A few days later, a funeral is held for Sten near the jungle waterfall, and Sal gives a decisive speech that somewhat restores social harmony. She announces that it is 11 September, so they will thus be celebrating the Tet festival in three days' time. Spending long hours alone in the forest as he hikes between lookout spots, Richard begins to experience hallucinations in which Daffy appears: They converse and patrol together the part of the island that Richard refers to as the DMZ. Richard comes to appreciate that Daffy killed himself because he could neither endure the unravelling of his elitist vision of the beach as the group grew in size, nor bear the thought of a return to either backpacking or settled life, and notes that he is also falling prey to that way of thinking. Richard also realizes that Daffy gave him the map ‚Äî as well as spread rumors of the island all over Thailand ‚Äî so that many travelers would come looking for the beach, inevitably leading to its becoming a tourist destination. Daffy describes this act as \\"euthanizing\\" the community, and Richard realizes he was merely a pawn in Daffy's revenge plan. This comes to a head following the arrival of the American/German group by raft. Unlike Richard, √âtienne, and Fran√ßoise, who managed to overcome all obstacles in getting to the beach, the newcomers never make it past the most dangerous hurdle: the cannabis farmers. Richard witnesses them being first beaten violently and then dragged away. The sound of gunshots implies that the farmers have murdered the intruders. Richard returns to the community campsite to immediately inform Sal and Jed of what happened. He then goes to the beach to visit Karl, who attacks Richard, provoking Richard to attack him before he gets free and runs off into the jungle. On the day of the Tet festival, Sal obtusely asks Richard to kill Karl because of the threat he poses to the group's now-fragile social integrity, complaining that she constantly has to lift morale in the wake of the poisoning incident and Sten's death. Richard swims out to the cave where the group's only boat is kept, only to find that Karl has used it to escape to the mainland. √âtienne corners Richard, thereafter and Richard soon discovers that √âtienne, along with the rest of his clique, has become frightened of Richard's \\"doing things\\" for Sal. Disillusioned with the beach, Richard convinces √âtienne, Fran√ßoise, Jed, and a paranoid Keaty to leave the beach for good, and euthanizes the dying Christo. Now fully aware of what Sal is willing to do to protect the beach, they decide to spike the food for the Tet celebration and escape on the raft that the doomed backpackers used. Night falls, and the party begins. People are in a celebratory mood, drinking fermented coconut milk. Prior to dinner, Keaty and Richard spike the stew that Unhygienix cooked with a huge quantity of cannabis to immobilize the group. Richard and his friends are about to slip away when the cannabis farmers arrive, threatening all of them with guns, as they believe that the beach dwellers invited the recent arrivals. The farmers beat up Richard and leave the bloodied corpses of the American/German backpackers as a warning. At the sight of this, the extremely intoxicated group experiences a collective mental breakdown and starts to rip the corpses apart in a frenzy. Sal discovers that Richard has spread the secret of the beach when she picks up the map he drew for Zeph and Sammy. Upon hearing this, the now unstable community members attack Richard with sharp objects. Richard believes that he is about to die, but he is saved when Fran√ßoise, √âtienne, Keaty, and Jed return from the beach armed with their fishing spears to drive the others off, seriously wounding Sal and Bugs in the process. Richard and his rescuers make their planned escape on the raft. In the epilogue, it is revealed that the five friends got away and split up when they reached the mainland. It has been a year and one month since their departure from Thailand, and Richard has returned home to England. He hasn't heard from Fran√ßoise and √âtienne, but states he is likely to bump into them eventually, because \\"the world is a small place, and Europe is even smaller\\". He still maintains contact with Keaty and Jed. By chance, Keaty and Jed end up working new jobs in the same building, although for different companies; similar to how they both happened to stay in the same guest house years before they first met at the beach. Richard hears in a news report that Cassie has been arrested in Malaysia for smuggling a large amount of heroin and will be the first Westerner to be executed in the country in six years. He wonders whether anyone else got off the island, particularly Unhygienix, whom he liked. He believes that Bugs died and hopes that Sal died too, because he dislikes the idea of her \\"turning up on his doorstep\\". Richard finishes by saying that he is content with his life, although he carries a lot of scars: \\"I like the way that sounds. I carry a of scars\\". Characters =Main characters= * Richard ‚Äì a young English traveller and the main narrator of the novel. * Daffy (Mister Duck) ‚Äì A Scottish traveller and one of the three original founders of the beach; appears as a mental apparition in Richard's consciousness in the later parts of the novel after his suicide. * √âtienne and Fran√ßoise ‚Äì both French; two young lovers who befriended Richard during their initial encounter in Bangkok, and subsequently join him in searching for the beach after Richard shows them the map. * Keaty ‚Äì English; becomes close friends with Richard, and shares a Game Boy addiction. Invited by Sal and Bugs to the beach after they enjoy going on a jungle trek with him over the Burmese border. * Jed ‚Äì English; becomes close friends with Richard, and is the island's watchman. Turned up on the beach without a personal invitation, having overheard a rumor of the island while traveling in Vientiane. Daffy is the sole person in the community completely against his uninvited arrival. * Sal ‚Äì American; one of the three original founders of the beach, and the unofficial leader of the community. =Other characters= * Zeph and Sammy ‚Äì The two stoner Americans to whom Richard leaves a copy of the map to the beach. * Bugs ‚Äì South African; Sal's boyfriend, one of the three original founders of the beach, and the community's head carpenter; has a mutual dislike with Richard. * Gregorio ‚Äì Spanish; member of Richard's fishing detail. Invited by Daffy to the beach after a robbing incident in Sumatra. * Unhygienix ‚Äì Italian; the community's head chef and is friends with Richard. Invited by Bugs to the beach after cooking him an excellent meal in Srinagar. * Ella ‚Äì Works in the cooking detail next to Unhygienix. Invited by Sal to the beach after bonding over a backgammon game whilst on an eighteen-hour bus ride together. * Jean ‚Äì French; leader of the gardening detail. Invited by Bugs to the beach after working together picking grapes from a vineyard in Blenheim. * Cassie ‚Äì English; girlfriend of Jesse; works with Bugs in the carpentry detail. * Jesse ‚Äì New Zealander; boyfriend of Cassie, and works with Jean in the gardening detail. * Moshe ‚Äì Israeli; head of the second fishing detail. Invited by Daffy to the beach after catching a street thief attempting to steal his backpack in Manila. * The Yugoslavian Girls ‚Äì Two unnamed females from Sarajevo in which Richard comments their names are hard to spell out or even pronounce, and are thus dubbed as the Yugo Girls. He gets the impression that they are haughty and aloof, and never gets to know them very well. They work with Moshe exclusively in the second fishing detail, as Sal regrets inviting them to the beach seeing as they aren't capable of doing anything else. * Karl, Sten, and Christo (The Swedes) ‚Äì all Swedish; Considered the best fishing detail since only they are comfortable with swimming through the submerged caves to fish in the open water. Only Sten is fluent in English, with Christo having fair knowledge, and Karl knowing only a few words. Like Jed, the Swedes arrived uninvited, as they learned of the beach's existence after overhearing Sal discussing with Jean about the island during a Rice Run. * The cannabis farmers ‚Äì A small group of Thai farmers armed with assault rifles, who live and maintain a large illegal cannabis field on the far side of the island, presumably exporting it to the mainland for sale. They've been on the island longer than the backpackers, but Sal, Daffy and Bugs came to an agreement with them early in the community's history. Part of Jed's and later Richard's job is to periodically sneak into their field and steal cannabis off the plants for the village's supply. When Richard is assigned to watch duty alone, he takes to stalking the guards through the jungle simply for the thrill.  Influences  Although set in Thailand, Garland wrote the book while living in the Philippines and, in particular, was inspired by similar geography on the island of Palawan. Reception Novelist Nick Hornby referred to The Beach as \\"a Lord of the Flies for Generation X\\", and the Sunday Oregonian called it \\"Generation X's first great novel\\". The Washington Post wrote that it is \\"a furiously intelligent first novel\\" and \\"a book that moves with the kind of speed and grace many older writers can only day-dream about.\\" Film and television adaptations The Beach was adapted as a film released in 2000, directed by Danny Boyle, and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Robert Carlyle, Virginie Ledoyen, and Guillaume Canet. The novel was at one point reportedly being considered for adaptation to a television series by The Secret Circle developer Andrew Miller.

This school of thought was the intellectual progenitor of Conservative Judaism. Through his father, he was a descendant of the Vienna exiles of 1670 and of the famous rabbinical Spira family; on his mother's side he descended from the Fischel family, which has given the community of Prague a number of distinguished Talmudists. He received his early Jewish education at the yeshiva of Bezalel Ronsburg (Daniel Rosenbaum). In 1825 he went to Budapest, where he prepared himself for the university, from which he graduated in 1831. In the following year he was appointed district rabbi (Kreisrabbiner) of Litomƒõ≈ôice by the government, being the first rabbi in Bohemia with a modern education. He made Teplice his seat, where the congregation, the largest in the district, had elected him rabbi. He was called to Dresden in 1836 as chief rabbi, and was confirmed in this position by the Saxon government. In 1843 he was invited to become the chief rabbi at Berlin, which position had been vacant since 1800. However, after a long correspondence he declined, chiefly because the Prussian government, in accordance with its fixed policy, refused to officially recognize the office. He remained in Dresden until 1854, when he was called to the presidency of the Breslau seminary, where he remained until his death.  Religious attitude  Frankel held that reason based on scholarship, and not mere desire on the part of the laity, must be the justification for any reforms within Judaism. In this sense Frankel declared himself when the president of the Teplice congregation expressed the hope that the new rabbi would introduce reforms and do away with the \\"Missbr√§uche\\" (abuses). He stated that he knew of no abuses; and that if there were any, it was not at all the business of the laity to interfere in such matters (Brann, in his \\"Jahrbuch,\\" 1899, pp. 109 et seq.). He introduced some slight modifications in Jewish prayer services such as: the abrogation of some hymns, the introduction of a choir of boys, and the like. He was opposed to any innovation which was objectionable to Jewish sentiment. In this respect, his denunciation of the action of the \\"Landesrabbiner\\" Joseph Hoffmann of Saxe-Meiningen, who permitted Jewish high-school boys to write on the Sabbath, is very significant (\\"Orient,\\" iii. 398 et seq.). His position in the controversy on the new Hamburg prayer book (1842) displeased both parties; the liberals were dissatisfied because, instead of declaring that their prayer-book was in accord with Jewish tradition, he pointed out inconsistencies from the historical and dogmatic points of view; and the Orthodox were dissatisfied because he declared changes in the traditional ritual permissible (l.c. iii. 352-363, 377-384). A great impression was produced by his letter of 18 July 1845, published in a Frankfurt-am-Main journal, in which he announced his secession from the rabbinical conference then in session in that city. He said that he could not cooperate with a body of rabbis who had passed a resolution declaring the Hebrew language unnecessary for public worship. This letter made Frankel one of the leaders of the conservative element. In opposition to the rabbinical conferences, he planned conventions of scholars. His principles were enunciated in his monthly Journal of the Religious Interests of Judaism,German language name: \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr die Religi√∂sen Interessen des Judenthums\\" which he published from 1844 onward. But Frankel's conciliatory attitude was bound to create for him enemies on both liberal and orthodox sides, and such was the case with Abraham Geiger and Samson Raphael Hirsch, respectively.  Controversy  Frankel was chosen president of the new rabbinical seminary at Breslau (10 August 1854). Geiger, who had inspired Jonas Fr√§nkel, the president of his congregation, to found this institution, opposed the appointment vigorously, and when the examination questions given by Frankel to the first graduating class appeared, Geiger published them in a German translation with the evident intention of ridiculing his methods of Talmudic instruction as sophistry (Geiger, \\"J√ºd. Zeit.\\" i. 169 et seq.). Samson Raphael Hirsch, immediately on the opening of the seminary, addressed an open letter to Frankel, demanding a statement as to the religious principles which would guide the instruction at the new institution. Frankel ignored the challenge. When the fourth volume of Gr√§tz's history appeared, Hirsch impeached the orthodoxy of the new institution (1856), and his attacks became more systematic when Frankel in 1859 published his Hebrew introduction to the Mishnah. The first attack began with the letter of , rabbi of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, published in Hirsch's \\"Jeschurun\\", 1860. Hirsch himself began in the following year a series of articles in which he took exception to some of Frankel's statements, especially to his definition of rabbinical tradition, which he found vague; he further objected to Frankel's conception of the rabbinical controversies, which were, according to Frankel, improperly decided by certain devices common in parliamentary bodies. It can hardly be denied that Frankel evaded the clear definition of what \\"tradition\\" meant to him. He contented himself with proving from Rabbenu Asher that not everything called a \\"law\\", and reputed as given by Moses on Mount Sinai, was actually of Mosaic origin. Hirsch was seconded by various Orthodox rabbis, such as Ezriel Hildesheimer, Solomon Klein of Colmar, and Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach, while some of Frankel's supporters, like Salomon Juda Rappoport, were half- hearted.Hakirah.org Frankel but once published a brief statement in his magazine, in which, however, he failed to give an outspoken exposition of his views (\\"Monatsschrift\\", 1861, pp. 159 et seq.). The general Jewish public remained indifferent to the whole controversy, and Frankel's position was gradually strengthened by the number of graduates from the seminary who earned reputations as scholars and as representatives of conservative Judaism.  Literary activity  Frankel began his literary career rather late. His first independent publication was his work on the Jewish oath, Jewish Oaths in Theology and HistoryTranslated from the German title: Die Eidesleistung bei den Juden in Theologischer und Historischer Beziehung (Dresden, 1840, 2d ed. 1847). This work owed its origin to a political question. The law of 16 August 1838, had improved the position of the Jews in Saxony, but still discriminated with regard to the Jewish oath, which was to be taken under conditions which seemed to involve the supposition that a Jew could not fully be trusted in his testimony before a civil court. Frankel proved that no Jewish doctrine justified such an assumption, and owing to his work, a new regulation (13 February 1840) put the Jews on the same basis as Christians as regards testimony in court.  Biblical studies  His second great work was his Historical-Critical Studies on the Septuagint as Addition to the Targumim Contributions: Preliminary Studies for the SeptuagintTranslated from the German title: Historisch-Kritische Studien zu der Septuaginta Nebst Beitr√§gen zu den Targumim: Vorstudien zu der Septuaginta (Leipzig, 1841). To the same category belong three later works: On the Influence of Palestinian Exegesis on Alexandrian HermeneuticsTranslted from the German title: Ueber den Einfluss der Pal√§stinensischen Exegese auf die Alexandrinische Hermeneutik (Leipzig, 1851); About Palestinian and Alexandrian Writing ResearchTranslated from the German title: Ueber Pal√§stinensische und Alexandrinische Schriftforschung published in the program for the opening of the Breslau seminary (Breslau, 1854); and On the Targum of the ProphetsTranslated from the German title: Zu dem Targum der Propheten (Breslau, 1872). In all these works it was his object to show that the exegesis of the Alexandrian Jews, and with it that of the early Church Fathers, was dependent on Talmudic exegesis. In this investigation he became a pioneer, and many of his disciples followed him with similar investigations, not only of the Septuagint, but also of the Vulgate and of the Peshitta. A political motive was involved in his study on legal procedure, \\"Der Gerichtliche Beweis nach Mosaisch-Talmudischem Rechte: Ein Beitrag zur Kenntnis des Mosaisch-Talmudischen Criminal-und Civilrechts: Nebst einer Untersuchung √ºber die Preussische Gesetzgebung Hinsichtlich des Zeugnisses der Juden\\" (Berlin, 1846). The law of Prussia discriminated against the Jews insofar as the testimony of a Jew against a Christian was valid only in civil cases, and in these only when they involved a sum less than fifty thalers. It was due to Frankel's work, which was cited as an authority in the Prussian Diet, that the new law of 23 July 1847 referring to the Jews, abolished this discrimination.  Introduction to Mishnah  Frankel's duties as professor of Talmudic literature showed him the necessity of modern scientific text-books on rabbinical literature and archeology. To this necessity are due his introduction to the Mishnah, \\"Darkei ha-Mishnah\\" (Leipzig, 1859), with a supplement and index under the title \\"Tosafot u-Mafteah; le-Sefer Darkei ha-Mishnah\\" (1867). Of the storm which this book created mention has been made already. It is one of the most valuable attempts at a systematized exposition of the history of early rabbinical literature and theology, and has largely inspired subsequent works of that kind, as those of Jacob Br√ºll and Isaac H. Weiss. His outline of rabbinical marriage law, \\"Grundlinien des Mosaisch-Talmudischen Eherechts\\" (Breslau, 1860), was likewise meant to serve as a textbook on that subject, as was also his attempt at a history of the post-Talmudic literature of sophistry, \\"Entwurf einer Geschichte der Literatur der Nachtalmudischen Responsen\\" (Breslau, 1865), which, however, is considered the weakest of his works. Frankel's studies in the history of Talmudic literature had convinced him that the neglect of the Jerusalem Talmud was a serious drawback in the critical investigation of the development of Talmudic law. To this field he determined to devote the remainder of his life. In 1870 he published his introduction to the Jerusalem Talmud under the title \\"Mebo ha-Yerushalmi\\" (Breslau). He afterward began a critical edition of the Jerusalem Talmud, with a commentary, but only three treatises had appeared, Berakot and Peah (Vienna, 1874) and Demai (Breslau, 1875), when his death intervened. He wrote frequently for the two magazines which he edited, the Zeitschrift f√ºr die Religi√∂sen Interessen des Judenthums (Leipzig, 1844‚Äì46), and the Monatsschrift f√ºr die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums, begun in 1851, and which he edited until 1868, when Gr√§tz succeeded him as editor. Though a son of the rationalistic era which produced two of its most intense partisans, Peter Beer and Herz Homberg in his native city, Frankel developed, partly through opposition to shallow rationalism and partly through the romantic environments of the ancient city of Prague, that love and sympathy for the past that made him the typical expounder of the historical school which was known as the \\"Breslau school.\\" His marriage with Rachel Meyer was childless.  Zacharias Frankel College  Zacharias Frankel College in Berlin is named after him.http://zacharias-frankel- college.de/fileadmin/upload/News/ZSRS_Press_Release_v6.pdf In 2017, Nitzan Stein Kokin, who was German, became the first person to graduate from Zacharias Frankel College, which also made her the first Conservative rabbi to be ordained in Germany since before World War II.  Marriage  He married Rachel Maier of Teplice. Through her mother, she was the great-granddaughter of Isak Landesmann of Police u Jemnice, who was remembered as a notable victim of eighteenth century anti-Semitism.H.

White was among those who sailed with Richard Grenville in the first attempt to colonize Roanoke Island in 1585, acting as artist and mapmaker to the expedition. He would most famously briefly serve as the governor of the second attempt to found Roanoke Colony on the same island in 1587 and discover the colonists had mysteriously vanished. During his time at Roanoke Island he made several watercolor sketches of the surrounding landscape and the native Algonkin peoples. These works are significant as they are the most informative illustrations of a Native American society of the Eastern seaboard; the surviving original watercolors are now preserved in the print room of the British Museum. In 1587, White became governor of Sir Walter Raleigh's failed attempt at a permanent settlement on Roanoke Island, known to history as the \\"Lost Colony\\". This was the earliest effort to establish a permanent English colony in the New World. White's granddaughter Virginia Dare was the first English child born in the Americas. After the failure of the colony, White retired to Raleigh's estates in Ireland, reflecting upon the \\"evils and unfortunate events\\" which had ruined his hopes in America, though never giving up hope that his daughter and granddaughter were still alive. Early life John White's exact date of birth is unknown but it seems likely he was born sometime in the 1530s‚Äì1540s.John White at ncpedia.org . Retrieved March 2011 There is a record dated 22 February 1539, of a christening in the Church of St Augustine, London, of a \\"John White\\" on that same day; but there is no proof this is the same person. White is known to have attended church in the parish of St. Martin Ludgate in London. In 1566, he married Tomasyn Cooper; with whom he had a son, Thomas, who died young, and a daughter, Eleanor. Little is known of White's training as an artist but it is possible that he apprenticed as an illustrator under a London master. Career Roanoke Indians In the late sixteenth century efforts to establish an English colony in the New World began to gain momentum, and White soon became an enthusiastic supporter. In 1577, White may have accompanied Martin Frobisher to search for precious metals and a northwest passage to Asia on his Baffin Island and Greenland expeditions in 1577. Despite this, White was not mentioned by name. His drawings from this period were of the lands and people encountered on the voyage. In 1585, White accompanied the expedition led by Sir Ralph Lane to attempt to found the first English colony in North America. White was sent by Sir Walter Raleigh as Sir Richard Grenville's artist- illustrator on his first voyage to the New World; he served as mapmaker and artist to the expedition, which encountered considerable difficulties and returned to England in 1586 . Gentleman artist In 1585 White had been commissioned to \\"draw to life\\" the inhabitants of the New World and their surroundings.Article in Smithsonian Magazine by Abigal Tucker, December 2008. Retrieved March 2011 During White's time at Roanoke Island, he completed numerous watercolor drawings of the surrounding landscape and native peoples. These works are significant as they are the most informative illustrations of a Native American society of the Eastern seaboard, and predate the first body of \\"discovery voyage art\\" created in the late 18th century by the artists who sailed with Captain James Cook. They represent the sole-surviving visual record of the native inhabitants of America encountered by England's first settlers. White's enthusiasm for watercolor was unusual ‚Äì most contemporary painters preferred to use oil-based paints.Milton, p.199 White's watercolors would soon become a sensation in Europe; it was not long before the watercolors were engraved by the Flemish master engraver Theodore de Bry.Milton, p.200 Through the medium of print, the illustrations became widely known and distributed; they were published in 1590 under the title America. Governor of the Roanoke colony White's patron, Sir Walter Raleigh White's sketch of the Roanoke area c. 1585 After Lane's colonists returned to England in 1586, Sir Walter Raleigh, who held the land patent for the proposed English colony of Virginia, tasked White with the job of organising a new settlement in the Chesapeake Bay area, one which would be self-sustaining and which would include women and children. During 1586 White was able to persuade 113 prospective colonists to join Raleigh's expedition, including his daughter Eleanor and his son-in-law Ananias Dare, recently married at St Bride's Church in Fleet Street.Morgan, p.77 His efforts did not go unrewarded; on 7 January 1587, Raleigh named \\"John White of London Gentleman, to be the chief Governor\\" of the new colony. White, with thirteen others, were incorporated under the name of \\"The Governor and Assistants of the Cities of Raleigh of Virginia\\".Queen's College, Oxford, MSS 137](a). On the occasion, he was granted arms with eight-quarters. The 1st contained his new arms: Ermine, on a canton Gules, a fusil Argent. The 2nd contained the ancient arms of White of Truro. The remaining six quarters contained the arms of some of his ‚ÄúAssistants‚Äù. This marshalling, other than being unorthodox, produced minute detail unsuitable for the New World Tapestry canvas. Therefore White (ancient) of Truro is depicted (Poptarts of 1587). =Arrival at Roanoke= In May 1587 White's colonists sailed for Virginia in the Lion. They were guided by the Portuguese navigator Simon Fernandez, the same pilot who had led the 1585 expedition and who was given by his fellow sailors the unhappy nickname of \\"the swine.\\"Milton, p.201 The settlers' chosen destination was not Roanoke but the Chesapeake Bay. But, upon reaching Roanoke in late July, and allowing the colonists to disembark, Fernandez refused to let White's men re-board the ship. According to White's journal, Fernandez's deputy \\"called to the sailors in the pinesse, charging them not to bring any of the planters [settlers] back againe, but leave them on the island.\\"Milton, p.215 Faced with what amounted to a mutiny by his navigator, White appears to have backed down and acquiesced in this sudden change of plan. Despite the governor's protests, Fernandez held that \\"summer was farre spent [summer was almost over], wherefore hee would land all the planters in no other place.\\"Milton, p.216 This second colony at Roanoke set about repairing the structures left behind in 1585. They also searched for the fifteen men left behind by the previous expedition, but found only bones.Milton, p.217 From an early stage there were tensions with the local Algonkin Indians, though initially things went well. White quickly made contact with friendly natives led by Chief Manteo, who explained to him that the lost fifteen had been killed by hostile Secotan, Aquascogoc, and Dasamongueponke warriors,Milton, p.218 choosing a time and place of attack \\"of great advantage to the savages.\\"Milton, p.220 On 8 August 1587, White led a dawn attack on the Dasamongueponkes that went disastrously wrong. White and his soldiers entered the Dasamongueponke village in the morning \\"so early that it was yet dark,\\"Miller, Lee, p.131. Retrieved April 2011 but mistakenly attacked a group of hitherto friendly Indians, killing one and wounding many. \\"We were deceaved,\\" wrote White in his journal, \\"for the savages were our friendes.\\" Henceforth, relations with the local tribes would steadily deteriorate.Milton, p.235 =Virginia Dare= Baptism of Virginia Dare, wood- engraving, 1880 On 18 August 1587, there was happier news ‚Äì White became a grandfather. \\"Elenora, daughter to the governour and wife to Ananias Dare, one of the assistants, was delivered of a daughter in Roanoke.\\"Milton, p.239 The child was healthy and \\"was christened there the Sunday following, and because this child was the first Christian born in Virginia,Modern-day North Carolina she was named Virginia.\\" =White returns to England= However, the colonists' food supplies soon began to grow short, and in late 1587 the settlers pressed White to return to England \\"for the better and sooner obtaining of supplies, and other necessaries.\\"Milton, p240 Because the colony had been deposited in Roanoke rather than the Chesapeake area, supply ships from England ignorant of Fernandez's change of plan would most likely not land in Roanoke at all, and the settlement might not survive the coming winter.Miller, Lee, p.132. Retrieved April 2011 White was reluctant to abandon his colony, anxious that his enemies in England \\"would not spare to slander [him] falsely\\" should he leave,Milton, p.241 and worried that his \\"stuff and goods might be spoiled and most of it pilfered away.\\" Eventually the colonists agreed to stand surety for White's belongings and he was prevailed upon to sail, \\"much against his will,\\" to seek help.Milton, p.243 Misfortune struck White's return to England from the beginning. The anchor of the flyboat on which White was quartered could not be raised, and many crew members were severely injured during the attempt.Milton, p.244 Worse, their journey home was delayed by \\"scarce and variable winds\\" followed by \\"a storm at the north- east,\\" and many sailors starved or died of scurvy.Milton, p.245 On 16 October 1587 the desperate crew, at last, landed in Smerwicke, in the west of Ireland, and White was finally able to make his way back to Southampton.Milton, p.246 =Spanish Armada= The invincible Spanish Armada, later proved to be vincible Further bad news awaited White on his return to England. Just two weeks previously Queen Elizabeth I had issued a general \\"stay of shipping,\\" preventing any ships from leaving English shores.Milton, p.247 The reason was the \\"invincible fleetes made by the King of Spain, joined with the power of the Pope, for the invading of England\\" ‚Äì the Spanish Armada. White's patron Sir Walter Raleigh attempted to provide ships to rescue the colony but he was over-ruled by the Queen.Milton, p.248 =Brave and the Roe= pinnace In early 1588 White was able to scrape together a pair of small pinnaces, the Brave and the Roe, which were unsuitable for military service and could be spared for the expedition to Roanoke. Unluckily for White, they were barely suited for the Atlantic crossing and the governor endured further bad luck as the ships were intercepted by French pirates, who \\"playd extreemely upon us with their shot,\\" hitting White (to his great embarrassment) \\"in the side of the buttoke.\\"Milton, p.249. White and his crew escaped to England with their lives, but \\"they robbed us of all our victuals, powder, weapons and provision,\\" and the journey to Virginia had to be abandoned.Milton, p.250 By this stage White appears to have formed the view that he was born under \\"an unlucky star.\\" =Return to the \\"Lost Colony\\"= Finally, in March 1590, with the immediate threat of a Spanish invasion by now abated, Raleigh was able to equip White's rescue expedition. Two ships, the Hopewell and the Moonlight set sail for Roanoke.Milton, p.257 The return journey was prolonged by extensive privateering and several sea battles, and White's eventual landing at the Outer Banks was further imperiled by poor weather.Milton, p.260 The landing was hazardous and was beset by bad conditions and adverse currents. During the landing on Roanoke, of the mariners who accompanied White, \\"seven of the chiefest were drowned.\\"Milton, p.262 Governor White finally reached Roanoke Island on 18 August 1590, his granddaughter's third birthday, but he found his colony had been long deserted. The buildings had collapsed and \\"the houses [were] taken downe.\\"Milton, p.265 The few clues about the colonists' whereabouts included the letters \\"CRO\\" carved into a tree, and the word \\"CROATOAN\\" carved on a post of the fort. Croatoan was the name of a nearby island (likely modern-day Hatteras Island) and of a local tribe of Native Americans. Roanoke Island was originally not a planned location for the colony and the idea of moving elsewhere had been discussed. Before the Governor's departure, he and the colonists had agreed that a message would be carved into a tree if they had moved and would include an image of a Maltese Cross if the decision was made by force. White found no such cross and was hopeful that his family were still alive.Milton, p.266 True to their word, the colonists had looked after White's belongings, which had been carefully buried and hidden. However, local Indians had looted the hiding place, and White found \\"about the place many of my things spoyled and broken, and my books torne from the covers, the frames of some of my pictures and mappes rotten and spoyled with rayne, and my armour almost eaten through with rust.\\"Milton p.267 Due to the weather, which \\"grew to be fouler and fouler,\\"Milton, p.268 White had to abandon the search of adjacent islands for the colonists. The ship's captain had already lost three anchors and could not afford the loss of another. White returned to Plymouth, England, on 24 October 1590. The loss of the colony was a personal tragedy for White, from which he never fully recovered. He would never return to the New World, and in a letter to Richard Hakluyt he wrote that he must hand over the fate of the colonists and his family \\"to the merciful help of the Almighty, whom I most humbly beseech to helpe and comfort them.\\" Later life Little is known of White's life after the failure of the Roanoke Colony. He lived in Plymouth,as the will of his twin brother Robert White bequeathing him property in the city of Plymouth, referred to him as \\"of Plymouth\\"Transcripts of Robert White's will are in the same MSS [Queen's College, Oxford, MSS 137]; and in the New World Tapestry Library (as is the New World Tapestry) at the British Empire & Commonwealth Museum, Bristol, England. and also owned a house at Newtown, Kylmore (Kilmore, County Cork), Ireland. He appears to have been in Ireland living on the estates of Sir Walter Raleigh, making maps of land for Raleigh's tenants, and reflecting upon the \\"evils and unfortunate events\\" which had ruined his hopes in the New World, though never giving up hope that his daughter and granddaughter were still alive.Milton, p.269 The last surviving document related to White is a letter he wrote from Ireland in 1593 to the publisher of the prints of his Roanoke drawings. However, a record from May 1606 that Bridget White, who was appointed estate administrator for her brother \\"John White\\", may refer to him. Legacy White is chiefly remembered today for his watercolors, which represent a unique record of 16th-century Algonquian society. All of White's surviving works are now in the print room of the British Museum. In 2007, the British Museum placed the entire group of John White's watercolors on public display under the collection, \\"A New World: England's First View of America.\\" There are more than seventy watercolors in the travelling exhibit. There were plans to show the collection at the North Carolina Museum of History. The World War II Liberty ship was named in his honor. In popular culture * In the sixth season of American Horror Story, White is mentioned in the third episode.

Introduced in January 1985 at the CES in Las Vegas, it appeared three years after its predecessor, the bestselling Commodore 64. The C128 is a significantly expanded successor to the C64, with nearly full compatibility. The newer machine has 128 KB of RAM in two 64 KB banks, and an 80-column color video output. It has a redesigned case and keyboard. Also included is a Zilog Z80 CPU which allows the C128 to run CP/M, as an alternative to the usual Commodore BASIC environment. The presence of the Z80 and the huge CP/M software library it brings, coupled with the C64's software library, gives the C128 one of the broadest ranges of available software among its competitors. The primary hardware designer of the C128 was Bil Herd, who had worked on the Plus/4. Other hardware engineers were Dave Haynie and Frank Palaia, while the IC design work was done by Dave DiOrio. The main Commodore system software was developed by Fred Bowen and Terry Ryan, while the CP/M subsystem was developed by Von Ertwine. Technical overview The BASIC prompt for the Commodore 128 in 40-column mode, running Commodore BASIC V7.0 The C128's keyboard includes four cursor keys, an Alt key, Help key, Esc key, Tab key and a numeric keypad. None of these were present on the C64 which had only two cursor keys, requiring the use of the Shift key to move the cursor up or left. This alternate arrangement was retained on the 128, for use under C64 mode. The lack of a numeric keypad, Alt key, and Esc key on the C64 was an issue with some CP/M productivity software when used with the C64's Z80 cartridge. A keypad was requested by many C64 owners who spent long hours entering machine language type-in programs. Many of the added keys matched counterparts present on the IBM PC's keyboard and made the new computer more attractive to business software developers. While the 128's 40-column mode closely duplicates that of the C64, an extra 1K of color RAM is made available to the programmer, as it is multiplexed through memory address 1. The C128's power supply is improved over the C64's unreliable design, being much larger and equipped with cooling vents and a replaceable fuse. The C128 does not perform a system RAM test on power-up like previous Commodore machines. Instead of the single 6510 microprocessor of the C64, the C128 incorporates a two-CPU design. The primary CPU, the 8502, is a slightly improved version of the 6510, capable of being clocked at 2 MHz. The second CPU is a Zilog Z80 which is used to run CP/M software, as well as to initiate operating-mode selection at boot time. The two processors cannot run concurrently, thus the C128 is not a multiprocessing system. The C128's complex architecture includes four differently accessed kinds of RAM (128 KB main RAM, 16‚Äì64 KB VDC video RAM, 2 kNibbles VIC-II Color RAM, 2-kilobyte floppy-drive RAM on C128Ds, 0, 128 or 512 KB REU RAM), two or three CPUs (main: 8502, Z80 for CP/M; the 128D also incorporates a 6502 in the disk drive), and two different video chips (VIC-IIe and VDC) for its various operational modes.http://oldcomputers.net/c128d.html Early versions of the C128 occasionally experience temperature-related reliability issues due to the use of an electromagnetic shield over the main circuit board. The shield was equipped with fingers that contacted the tops of the major chips, ostensibly causing the shield to act as a large heat sink. A combination of poor contact between the shield and the chips, the inherently limited heat conductivity of plastic chip packages, as well as the relatively poor thermal conductivity of the shield itself, resulted in overheating and failure in some cases. The SID sound chip is particularly vulnerable in this respect. The most common remedy is to remove the shield, which Commodore had added late in development to comply with FCC radio-frequency regulations. The C128 has three operating modes. C128 Mode (native mode) runs at 1 or 2 MHz with the 8502 CPU and has both 40- and 80-column text modes available. CP/M Mode uses both the Z80 and the 8502Commodore CP/M Source code and programmers' manual. and is able to function in both 40- or 80-column text mode. C64 Mode is nearly 100 percent compatible with the earlier computer. Selection of these modes is implemented via the Z80 chip. The Z80 controls the bus on initial boot-up and checks to see if there is a CP/M disk in the drive, if there are any C64/C128 cartridges present, or if the Commodore key (which serves as the C64-mode selector) is being depressed on boot-up. Based on these conditions, it will switch to the appropriate mode of operation. =C128 mode= C128 main board In 1984, a year before the release of the Commodore 128, Commodore released the Plus/4. Although targeted at a low-end business market that could not afford the relatively high cost and training requirements of early IBM PC compatibles, it was perceived by the Commodore press as a follow-up to the 64 and would be expected to improve upon that model's capabilities. While the C64's graphics and sound capabilities were generally considered excellent, the response to the Plus/4 was one of disappointment. Upon the Plus/4's introduction, repeated recommendations were made in the Commodore press for a new computer called the \\"C-128\\" with increased RAM capacity, an 80-column display as was standard in business computers, a new BASIC programming language that made it easy for programmers to use the computer's graphics and sound without resorting to PEEK and POKEs, a new disk drive that improved upon the 1541's abysmal transfer rate, as well as total C64 compatibility. The designers of the C128 succeeded in addressing most of these concerns. A new chip, the VDC, provides the C128 with an 80-column color CGA-compatible display (also called RGBI for red- green-blue plus intensity). The then-new 8502 microprocessor is completely backward-compatible with the C64's 6510, but can run at double the speed if desired. The C64's BASIC 2.0 was replaced with BASIC 7.0, which includes structured programming commands from the Plus/4's BASIC 3.5, as well as keywords designed specifically to take advantage of the machine's capabilities. A sprite editor and machine language monitor were added. The screen-editor part of the Kernal was further improved to support an insert mode and other features accessed through ESC-key combinations, as well as a rudimentary windowing feature, and was relocated to a separate ROM. The VIC-II chip which controls the 40-column display can only operate at 1 MHz, so the 40-column display appears jumbled in \`FAST\` mode. In 80-column mode the editor takes advantage of VDC features to provide blinking and underlined text, activated through escape codes, in addition to the standard Commodore reverse text. The C128's 80-column mode can display lowercase characters along with PETSCII graphics characters; 40-column mode is subject to the same \\"upper- and lowercase\\" or \\"uppercase-plus-graphics\\" restriction as earlier Commodores. The 40- and 80-column modes are independent and both can be active at the same time. A programmer with both a composite and RGB display can use one of the screens as a \\"scratchpad\\" or for rudimentary multiple buffer support. The active display can be switched with ESC-X. A hardware reset button was added to the system. The keyboard, however, was not switched to the Selectric layout as had become standard, instead retaining the same ADM-3A-derived design as on Commodore's prior models. The back of the Commodore 128 The VDC chip is largely useless for gaming since it has no sprites or raster interrupts. NTSC C128s will work with any CGA-type monitor (TTL RGB @ 15 kHz/60 Hz) such as the IBM 5153. However, PAL models of the C128 operate at 50 Hz and aren't compatible with most CGA monitors, which expect a 60 Hz refresh rate. Pin 7 of the VDC output (normally unused on CGA monitors) produces a monochrome NTSC/PAL signal, but no cable was provided for it and interested users had to make their own or purchase one on the aftermarket. Two new disk drives were introduced in conjunction with the C128: the short-lived single-sided 1570 and the double-sided 1571. A dual-disk 1572 model was announced but never produced. Later on, the 3.5-inch 1581 was introduced. All of these drives are more reliable than the 1541 and promise much better performance via a new \\"burst mode\\" feature. The 1581 drive also has more on-board RAM than its predecessors, making it possible to open a larger number of files at one time. BASIC 7.0 includes \`DLOAD\` and \`DSAVE\` commands to support loading and saving to disk without using the \`,8\` or other device number, and also a \`DIRECTORY\` command that reads a disk's catalog information directly to screen memory without overwriting BASIC memory as in BASIC 2.0. In addition, the C128 introduces auto-booting of disk software, a feature standard on most personal computers, but absent from Commodore machines up to that point. Users no longer have to type \`LOAD\\"*\\",8,1\`. BASIC also added a COLLECT command for removing \\"splat\\" files (files that were not closed properly and truncated to zero length). All 1571 drives will normally start up in native mode on the C128. If the user switches to C64 mode by typing \\"GO 64\\", the drive remains in native mode. But if C64 mode is activated by holding the Commodore key down when powering-up, the 1571 then goes into 1541 mode. This routine is necessary for software that performs low-level drive access. The C128 has twice the RAM of the C64, a far higher proportion of which is available for BASIC programming, due to the new MMU bank-switching chip. This allows BASIC program code to be stored separately from variables, greatly enhancing the machine's ability to handle complex programs, speeding garbage collection and easing debugging for the programmer. An executing program can be \`STOP\`ped, its code edited, variable values inspected or altered in direct mode, and program execution resumed with the variable table intact using BASIC's \`GOTO\` command. Although other BASICs support the \`CONT\` command to restart execution without clearing variables, editing any code causes them to be cleared. Different memory configurations can be loaded using BASIC's \`BANK\` command. BASIC 7.0 has a full complement of graphics and sound-handling commands, as well as BASIC 4.0's disk commands and improved garbage cleanup, and support for structured programming via IF...THEN...ELSE, DO...WHILE, and WHILE...WEND loops. Programmable characters are still however not supported, so the programmer will have to manipulate them with PEEK and POKE as on the VIC-20 and C64. On the downside, BASIC 7.0 ran considerably slower than BASIC 2.0 unless 2 MHz mode was used due to its 28 KB size (a 250% increase over BASIC 2.0) and having to bank switch to access program variables and BASIC program text (if greater than 16k in length). The 128's ROM contains an easter egg: Entering the command \`SYS 32800,123,45,6\` in native mode reveals a screen with a listing of the machine's main developers followed by the message \`Link arms, don't make them.\\"\` Also, entering the keywords \`QUIT\` or \`OFF\` will produce an \`?UNIMPLEMENTED COMMAND ERROR\`. These commands are holdovers from the BASIC interpreter intended for a planned but never-produced LCD portable computer and had been intended to exit from the BASIC interpreter and to ignore keyboard input during sensitive program execution, respectively. The C128's greater hardware capabilities, especially the increased RAM, screen display resolution, and serial bus speed, made it a more capable platform than the C64 for running the GEOS graphical operating system. =CP/M mode= Using CP/M mode requires use of a boot diskette. The diskette was included with the computer, which did not include a disk drive. The second of the C128's two CPUs is the Zilog Z80, which allows the C128 to run CP/M. The C128 was shipped with CP/M 3.0 (a.k.a. CP/M Plus, which is backward-compatible with CP/M 2.2) and ADM31/3A terminal emulation. A CP/M cartridge had been available for the C64, but it was expensive and of limited use since the 1541 drive cannot read the MFM-formatted disks that CP/M software was distributed on. Software had to be made available on Commodore-specific disks formatted using the GCR encoding scheme. Commodore made versions of PerfectCalc and the EMACS-derived PerfectWriter available,Compute! April 1985 and Commodore user groups sometimes had a selection of CP/M diskettes, but the limited software availability negated one of CP/M's chief attractions‚Äîits huge software library. In addition, the cartridges only work on early model C64s from 1982 and are incompatible with later units. Since they were also incompatible with the C128, the design team decided to support CP/M by putting the Z80 on the main system board. The C128 runs CP/M noticeably slower than most dedicated CP/M systems, as the Z80 processor runs at an effective speed of only 2 MHz. This was because the C128's system bus was designed around the 65xx CPUs. These CPUs handle data and memory addressing very differently from the Z80. CP/M also ran more slowly due to the reasons mentioned below, such as needing to pass control to the 8502 for any I/O or interrupt processing. For these reasons, few users actually ran CP/M software on the C128. When the C128 is powered on, the Z80 is active first and executes a small boot loader ROM at $0-$FFF to check for the presence of a CP/M disk. If one is not detected, control is passed to the 8502 and C128 native mode is started. CP/M mode in practice requires a 1571 or 1581 drive to be useful, since a 1541 cannot read MFM disks and will run much slower due to not supporting the C128's burst mode. CP/M boot disks nonetheless must be in the drive's native GCR format; MFM disks cannot be booted from, only read once the user is already in CP/M. This is because the code necessary to operate the drive in MFM mode is loaded as part of the boot process. In addition, 80-column mode is generally required since most CP/M software expects an 80-column screen. The C128 emulates an ADM-3A terminal in CP/M mode, so software will have to be set up for that. Aside from the standard ADM-3A terminal commands, a number of extra ones are available to use the VIC-II and VDC's features, including setting the text and background color. The CP/M command interpreter (although not application software) includes a safeguard to prevent the user from issuing a control code to make the text and background the same color, which would render text invisible and force the user to reset the computer. If this happens, it will default to a gray background with brown text. In CP/M mode, it is possible to run MBASIC, Microsoft's release of BASIC-80 for CP/M. Compared with the native mode BASIC 7.0, MBASIC is terse and limited in its capabilities, requiring the use of terminal-style key combinations to edit program lines or move the text cursor and lacking any sound or graphics features. Although MBASIC has mathematical and calculation features that BASIC 7.0 lacks such as integer and double precision variable support, any speed advantage gained by the use of integer variables is rendered moot by the extremely slow performance of the computer in CP/M mode. Moreover, Commodore BASIC has 40-bit floating point which serves as a middle ground between MBASIC's 32-bit floating point and 64-bit double precision variables. MBASIC also offers only 34k of free program space against BASIC 7.0's approximately 90k. Other CP/M software such as Wordstar and Supercalc will also be significantly outperformed by native mode C128 equivalents like PaperClip, which also have an easier to use interface. The CP/M CBIOS (the part of CP/M that interfaces with the hardware) does not directly interface with the hardware like on most CP/M implementations, rather it calls the kernal routines for interrupt handing and I/O‚Äîwhen the kernal needs to be used, the Z80 uses routines at $FFD0-$FFEF to pass parameter data to the 8502, which is then activated and the Z80 deactivated. After the kernal routine is finished executing, control is passed back to the Z80. It was reported that the programmer in charge of porting CP/M to the C128 had intended to have the CBIOS interface with the hardware directly in Z80 machine language, but had great difficulty with the VDU chips as they were prone to overheating and self-destructing. The VDU also underwent numerous hardware revisions while the C128 was in development and the CP/M programmer was unable to get his code working properly, so the C128 engineering team requested instead that he simply rewrite the CBIOS to pass function calls to the 8502.https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2361/why-does-the- commodore-c128-perform-poorly-when-running-cp-m CP/M mode is very different from the operating environments familiar to Commodore users. While Commodore DOS is built into the ROM of Commodore disk drives and is usually accessed through BASIC, CP/M requires the use of a boot diskette and requires entry of terse commands inherited from minicomputer platforms. CP/M programs tend to lack the user-friendly nature of most Commodore applications. Intended to give the new computer a large library of professional-grade business software that Commodore lacked, CP/M was long past its prime by the mid-1980s, and so it was seldom used on the C128. =C64 mode= Photo from the 1980s showing a C128 set-up with two disk drives and two monitors displaying the independent 40- and 80-column screens. Many users continued to use the 1541 inherited from their C64 system as a second drive. By incorporating the original C64 BASIC and Kernal ROMs in their entirety (16 KB total), the C128 achieves almost 100 percent compatibility with the Commodore 64. The C64 mode can be accessed in one of three ways: * holding down the Commodore-logo key when booting the system * entering the \`GO 64\` command, then responding \`Y\` to the \`ARE YOU SURE?\` prompt, in BASIC 7.0 * booting with a C64 cartridge plugged in Grounding the cartridge port's /EXROM and/or /GAME lines will cause the computer to automatically start up in C64 mode. This feature faithfully duplicates the C64's behavior when a cartridge (such as Simons' BASIC) is plugged into the port and asserts either of these lines but, unlike an actual C64, where the memory-map-changing action of these lines is implemented directly in hardware, the C128's Z80 firmware startup code polls these lines on power-up and then switches modes as necessary. C128 native-mode cartridges are recognized and started by the kernal polling defined locations in the memory map. C64 mode almost exactly duplicates the features of a hardware C64. The MMU, Z80, and IEC burst mode are disabled in C64 mode, however all other C128 hardware features including the VDU and 2 MHz mode are still accessible. The extended keys of the C128 keyboard may be read from machine language, although the kernal routines only recognize the keys that exist on the C64. A few games are capable of detecting if a C128 is running and switching to 2 MHz mode during the vertical retrace for faster performance. On North American C128s, when in C64 mode, even the character (font) ROM changes from that of C128 mode. Early C128 prototypes had a single ROM, with a slightly improved character set over that of the C64. But some C64 programs read the character ROM as data, and will fail in various ways on a C128. Thus, the C128 was given a double-sized character ROM, which delivers the C128 font in C128 mode, and the C64 font in C64 mode. International models of the C128 use the unmodified C64 font in both modes, since the second half of the character ROM is instead dedicated to the international font (containing such things as accented characters or German umlauts). Some of the few C64 programs that fail on a C128 will run correctly when the \`caps lock\` key is pressed down (or the ASCII/National key on international C128 models). This has to do with the larger built-in I/O port of the C128's CPU. Whereas the \`SHIFT LOCK\` key found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left \`SHIFT\` key, the \`CAPS LOCK\` key on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the \`CAPS LOCK\` key in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue. A handful of C64 programs write to \`$D030 (53296)\`, often as part of a loop initializing the VIC-II chip registers. This memory-mapped register, unused in the C64, determines the system clock rate. Since this register is fully functional in C64 mode, an inadvertent write can scramble the 40-column display by switching the CPU over to 2‚ÄìMHz, at which clock rate the VIC-II video processor cannot produce a coherent display. Fortunately, few programs suffer from this flaw. In July 1986, COMPUTE!'s Gazette published a type-in program that exploited this difference by using a raster interrupt to enable fast mode when the bottom of the visible screen was reached, and then disable it when screen rendering began again at the top. By using the higher clock rate during the vertical blank period, standard video display is maintained while increasing overall execution speed by about 20 percent.jul86-64 ModeSpeedjul86-64 ModeSpeed An easy way to differentiate between a hardware C64 and a C128 operating in C64 mode, typically used from within a running program, is to write a value different from \`$FF (255)\` to memory address \`$D02F (53295)\`, a register which is used to decode the extra keys of the C128 (the numerical keypad and some other keys). On the C64 this memory location will always contain the value \`$FF\` no matter what is written to it, but on a C128 in C64 mode the value of the location‚Äîa memory-mapped register‚Äîcan be changed. Thus, checking the location's value after writing to it will reveal the actual hardware platform. =RAM setup= To handle the relatively large amounts of ROM and RAM (tenfold the size of 8502's 64 KB address space) the C128 uses the 8722 MMU chip to create different memory maps, in which different combinations of RAM and ROM would appear according to bit patterns written into the MMU's configuration register at memory address \`$FF00\`. Another feature of the memory management unit is to allow relocation of zero page and the stack. Although the C128 can theoretically support 256k of RAM in four blocks, the PCB has no provisions to add this extra RAM, nor can the MMU actually access more than 128k. Therefore, if the MMU is programmed to access blocks 2 or 3, all that results is a mirror of the RAM in blocks 0 and 1. Since the I/O registers and system ROMs can be disabled or enabled freely, as well as being locatable in either RAM bank and the VIC-II set to use either bank for its memory space, up to 256 memory configurations are possible, although the vast majority of them are useless (for example, unworkable combinations like the kernal ROM in bank 0 and the I/O registers in bank 1 are possible). Because of this, BASIC's BANK statement allows the user to select 15 of the most useful arrangements, with the power- on default being Bank 15. This default places the system ROMs, I/O registers, and BASIC program text in block 0, with block 1 being used by BASIC program variables. BASIC program text and variables can extend all the way to $FFEF. But since block 0 contains the ROMs and I/O registers from $4000 onward, BASIC uses an internal switching routine to read program text higher than $3FFF. The top and bottom 1k of RAM ($0‚Äì$3FF and $FF00-$FFFF) are \\"shared\\" RAM, visible from both blocks. The MMU allows either to be expanded in increments up to 16k. The $0‚Äì$3FF range contains the zero page and stack while $FF00-$FFFF contains the MMU registers and reset vectors. These areas are always shared and cannot be switched to non-shared RAM. Shared RAM is always the opposite bank from the one currently being used by the CPU, thus if bank 0 is selected, any read or write to shared RAM will refer to the corresponding locations in bank 1 and vice versa. The VIC-II can be set to use either RAM bank and from there, its normal 16k window. While on the C64, the VIC-II can only see the character ROM in banks 2 and 4 of its memory space, the C128, on the other hand, makes it possible to enable or disable the character ROM for any VIC-II bank via the register at $1. Also, there are two sets of color RAM‚Äîone visible to the CPU, the other to the VIC-II and the user may select what chip sees what. In CP/M mode, the Program Segment Prefix and Transient Program Area reside in Bank 1 and the I/O registers and CP/M system code in Bank 0. The C128's RAM is expandable from the standard 128 KB to 256, 512 or even 1,024 KB, either by using commercial memory expansion modules, or by making one based on schematics available on the internet.Memory expansions for the Commodore 128 Commodore's RAM Expansion Units use an external 8726 DMA controllerhttp://c64.saschakimmel.de/produkt-reu-1764.php to transfer data between the C128's RAM and the RAM in the expansion unit. Commodore 128D Commodore 128D on display at the Mus√©e Bolo, EPFL, Lausanne Commodore 128DCR switch-mode power supply, fitted with a 40 mm cooling fan Late in 1985, Commodore released to the European market a new version of the C128 with a redesigned chassis resembling the Amiga 1000. Called the Commodore 128D, this new European model featured a plastic chassis with a carrying handle on the side, incorporated a 1571 disk drive into the main chassis, replaced the built-in keyboard with a detachable one, and added a cooling fan. The keyboard also featured two folding legs for changing the typing angle. According to Bil Herd, head of the Hardware Team (a.k.a. the \\"C128 Animals\\"), the C128D was ready for production at the same time as the regular version. Working to release two models at the same time had increased the risk for on-time delivery and was apparent in that the main PCB has large holes in critical sections to support the C128D case and the normal case concurrently. In the latter part of 1986, Commodore released a version of the C128D in North America and parts of Europe referred to as the C128DCR, CR meaning \\"cost- reduced\\". The DCR model features a stamped-steel chassis in place of the plastic version of the C128D (with no carrying handle), a modular switched- mode power supply similar to that of the C128D, retaining that model's detachable keyboard and internal 1571 floppy drive. A number of components on the mainboard were consolidated to reduce production costs and, as an additional cost-reduction measure, the 40 millimeter cooling fan that was fitted to the D model's power supply was removed. However, the mounting provisions on the power supply subchassis were retained, as well as the two 12-volt DC connection points on the power supply's printed circuit board for powering the fan. The C128DCR mounting provision is for a 60mm fan. A significant improvement introduced with the DCR model was the replacement of the 8563 video display controller (VDC) with the more technically advanced 8568 VDC and equipping it with 64 kilobytes of video RAM‚Äîthe maximum amount addressable by the device. The four-fold increase in video RAM over that installed in the \\"flat\\" C128 made it possible, among other things, to maintain multiple text screens in support of a true windowing system, or generate higher-resolution graphics with a more flexible color palette. Little commercial software took advantage of these possibilities. The C128DCR is equipped with new ROMs dubbed the \\"1986 ROMs,\\" so-named from the copyright date displayed on the power-on banner screen. The new ROMs address a number of bugs that are present in the original ROMs, including an infamous off-by-one error in the keyboard decoding table, in which the 'Q' character would remain lower case when CAPS LOCK was active. Some software will only run on the DCR, due to dependencies on the computer's enhanced hardware features and revised ROMs. Despite the DCR's improved RGB video capabilities, Commodore did not enhance BASIC 7.0 with the ability to manipulate RGB graphics. Driving the VDC in graphics mode continues to require the use of calls to screen-editor ROM primitives or their assembly language equivalents, or by using third-party BASIC language extensions, such as Free Spirit Software's \\"BASIC 8\\", which adds high-resolution VDC graphics commands to BASIC 7.0. Market performance By January 1987 Info reported that \\"All of those rumors about the imminent death of the C128 may have some basis in fact.\\" Stating that Commodore wanted to divert resources to increasing 64C production and its PC clones, the magazine stated that, \\"The latest word online is that the last C128 will roll off the lines in December of 1987.\\" Compute! stated in 1989, \\"If you bought your 128 under the impression that 128-specific software would be plentiful and quick to arrive, you've probably been quite disappointed. One of the 128's major selling points is its total compatibility with the 64, a point that's worked more against the 128 than for it.\\" Because the 128 would run virtually all 64 software, and because the next-generation 32/16-bit home computers‚Äîprimarily the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST‚Äîrepresented the latest technology, relatively little software for the C128's native mode appeared (probably on the order of 100‚Äì200 commercial titles, plus the usual share of public domain and magazine type-in programs), leading some users to regret their purchase. While the C128 sold a total number of 4 million units between 1985 and 1989, its popularity paled in comparison to that of its predecessor. One explanation for these lower sales numbers may be because the C64 was sold to people primarily interested in video games, which the more expensive C128 didn't add much value towards improving. Some C64 software such as Bard's Tale III and Kid Niki ran in 128 mode without stating this in the documentation, using the autoboot and the 1571's faster disk access. Some Infocom text adventures took advantage of the 80-column screen and increased memory capacity. Some C64 games were ported to native mode like Kikstart 2 and The Last V8 from Mastertronic, which had separate C128 versions, and Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny from Origin Systems, which used extra RAM for music if running on the C128. Star Fleet I: The War Begins from Interstel had separate versions, and took advantage of 80-column display on the C128. The vast majority of games simply ran in C64 mode. By contrast, many C64 productivity software titles were ported to the C128, including the popular PaperClip and Paperback Writer series. This software used the extra memory, 80-column screen, enhanced keyboard and large-capacity disk drives to provide features that were considered essential for business use. With its advanced BASIC programming language, CP/M compatibility and \\"user-friendly\\" native software packages such as Jane, Commodore attempted to create a low-end business market for the C128 similar to its strategy with the Plus/4, even distancing itself from the home computer label by branding the C128 a \\"Personal Computer\\" on the case. Significantly, the C128 was the first Commodore computer to advertise its use of Microsoft BASIC, where the Microsoft name would have been a competitive asset. The C128 was certainly a better business machine than the C64, but not really a better gaming machine. People who wanted business machines bought IBM PC clones almost exclusively by the time the C128 was released. The availability of low-cost IBM compatibles like the Leading Edge Model D and Tandy 1000 that, in some cases, sold for less than a complete C128 system derailed Commodore's small business computer strategy. There was a professional-level CAD program, Home Designer by BRiWALL,RUN Magazine Issue 64 but again, most of this work was done on PCs by the C128's era. The main reason that the C128 still sold fairly well was probably that it was a much better machine for hobbyist programming than the C64, as well as being a natural follow-on model to owners with significant investments in C64 peripherals. But ultimately the C128 could not compete with the new 16/32-bit systems, which outmatched it and the rest of its 8-bit generation in nearly every aspect. When the C128(D/DCR) was discontinued in 1989, it was reported to cost nearly as much to manufacture as the Amiga 500, even though the C128D had to sell for several hundred dollars less to keep the Amiga's high-end marketing image intact. Bil Herd has stated that the design goals of the C128 did not initially include 100% compatibility with the C64. Some form of compatibility was always intended after Herd was approached at the Plus/4's introduction by a woman who was disappointed that the educational software package she had written for the C64 would not run on Commodore's new computer, but when Commodore's marketing department learned of this, they independently announced total compatibility. Herd gave the reason for the 128's inclusion of a Z80 processor as ensuring this \\"100% compatibility\\" claim, since supporting the C64's Z80 cartridge would have meant the C128 supplying additional power to the cartridge port. He also stated that the VDC video chip and Z80 were sources of trouble during the machine's design. Herd added that \\"I only expected the C128 to be sold for about a year, we figured a couple of million would be nice and of course it wouldn‚Äôt undercut Amiga or even the C64\\".In Memory Of The Commodore C128 After Commodore raised the price of the 64 for the first time by introducing the redesigned 64C in 1986, its profit from each 64C sold was reportedly much greater than that from the C128.

The scutellum is the small V-shaped area between the wing cases; it may show several small, irregular, white lines and marks. The underside of the beetle has a coppery colour, and its upper side is sometimes bronze, copper, violet, blue/black, or grey. Cetonia aurata should not be confused with the North American rose chafer, Macrodactylus subspinosus, or with the rarely seen noble chafer, Gnorimus nobilis, which is very similar to the rose chafer. One way to identify Cetonia aurata is to look at its scutellum; on the noble chafer the scutellum is an equilateral triangle, but on the rose chafer it is an isosceles triangle. Overview Rose chafers are capable of fast flight; they fly with their wing cases down. They feed on pollen, nectar, and flowers, especially roses. They can be found among roses on warm sunny days from May until June or July, and occasionally as late as September. Rose chafers are found in southern and central Europe and in the southern part of the United Kingdom, where they sometimes seem to be very localized. They can also be found in South East Asia, in the countryside and outlying islands of Hong Kong. They are a beneficial saprophagous species (detritivores). =Life cycle= The larvae are C‚Äìshaped and have a firm, wrinkled, hairy body, a small head, and tiny legs. The larvae overwinter wherever they have been feeding, which may be in compost, manure, leaf mould, or rotting wood. They grow very quickly and will have moulted twice before the end of autumn. They have a two-year life cycle. They pupate in June or July. Some adult beetles may emerge in autumn, but the main emergence is in spring, when the beetles mate. After mating, the female beetles lay their eggs in decaying organic matter and then die. Coloration The metallic green coloration of the beetle is created structurally, caused by the reflection of mostly circularly polarised light; like other scarabs this is left circularly polarised. When viewed through a right circular polariser, the beetle appears to be colorless. There are also different colors besides the common green; there is also copper, grey and black. A lot of specimens have white speckles while some have very few or none at all. It has been described as a left-hand narrow-band elliptical polarizer.Chirality-induced polarization effects in the cuticle of scarab beetles: 100 years after Michelson. 2012 Gallery Scara fg03.jpgLarva Cetoine global.jpgPupa Cetonia aurata (Linnaeus 1761).jpgAdult C√©toine dor√©e vol.jpgWith outspread wings; note the closed elytra Cetonia aurata take off composition 05172009.jpgFlight pattern Cetonia aurata MF.jpgColor variations Rose chafers (Cetonia aurata) on thistle (Carduus sp.).jpgon thistle See also *Scarab (disambiguation) *Scarab (artifact) References External links *La C√©toine Dor√©e (Cetonia aurata) (Col√©opt√®re Cetoniidae) *Photos of Cetonia aurata *Photos of Rose chafer - Cetonia aurata and other flower beetles. *Rose chafer Cetonia aurata, some life cycle photos. *Color of Cetonia aurata through 3D movie glasses, a 23-second YouTube video demonstrating the handedness of the shiny color of the beetle.

The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object- oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low- level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms. C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as C++17). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ is on a three-year release schedule, with C++20 the next planned standard (and then C++23).  History  Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, in his AT&T; New Jersey office c. 2000 In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on \\"\\", the predecessor to C++. The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T; Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML. Initially, Stroustrup's \\"C with Classes\\" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments. In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named \\"C++\\" (++ being the increment operator in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, Cfront. In 1984, Stroustrup implemented the first stream input/output library. The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy (who had previously suggested Unix pipes). In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard. The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year. In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991. New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type. A quiz on C++11 features being given in Paris in 2015 In 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update (C++03) was released in 2003. After C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C++17.https://herbsutter.com/2016/06/30/trip-report-summer-iso-c-standards- meeting-oulu/ \\"the next standard after C++17 will be C++20\\" The C++20 standard became technically finalized in February 2020, and a draft was approved on 4th September 2020; it is expected to be published by the end of 2020. C++ is now the fourth most popular programming language, behind Java, C, and Python.\\"Latest news.\\" TIOBE Index  TIOBE - The Software Quality Company. N.p., n.d.

On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering, \\"for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language\\".https://www.nae.edu/177355.aspx \\"Computer Science Pioneer Bjarne Stroustrup to Receive the 2018 Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering\\" = Etymology = According to Stroustrup, \\"the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C\\". This name is credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983) and was first used in December 1983. When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a tongue-in-cheek spirit. The name comes from C's ++ operator (which increments the value of a variable) and a common naming convention of using \\"+\\" to indicate an enhanced computer program. During C++'s development period, the language had been referred to as \\"new C\\" and \\"C with Classes\\" before acquiring its final name. = Philosophy = Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles: * It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs. * Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so). * Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++. * Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++. * It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well-defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts. * No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer). * User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types. * Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance). * There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language). * C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment. * If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control. = Standardization = Scene during the C++ Standards Committee meeting in Stockholm in 1996 { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" style=\\"margin-left: 1.5em;\\" +C++ standards - !scope=\\"col\\" Year !scope=\\"col\\" C++ Standard !scope=\\"col\\" Informal name - !scope=\\"row\\" 1998  ISO/IEC 14882:1998  C++98 - !scope=\\"row\\" 2003  ISO/IEC 14882:2003  C++03 - !scope=\\"row\\" 2011  ISO/IEC 14882:2011  C++11, C++0x - !scope=\\"row\\" 2014  ISO/IEC 14882:2014  C++14, C++1y - !scope=\\"row\\" 2017  ISO/IEC 14882:2017  C++17, C++1z - !scope=\\"row\\" 2020  to be determined  C++20, C++2a } C++ is standardized by an ISO working group known as JTC1/SC22/WG21. So far, it has published five revisions of the C++ standard and is currently working on the next revision, C++20. In 1998, the ISO working group standardized C++ for the first time as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which is informally known as C++98. In 2003, it published a new version of the C++ standard called ISO/IEC 14882:2003, which fixed problems identified in C++98. The next major revision of the standard was informally referred to as \\"C++0x\\", but it was not released until 2011. C++11 (14882:2011) included many additions to both the core language and the standard library. In 2014, C++14 (also known as C++1y) was released as a small extension to C++11, featuring mainly bug fixes and small improvements. The Draft International Standard ballot procedures completed in mid-August 2014. After C++14, a major revision C++17, informally known as C++1z, was completed by the ISO C++ Committee in mid July 2017 and was approved and published in December 2017.Trip report: Summer ISO C++ standards meeting (Toronto) As part of the standardization process, ISO also publishes technical reports and specifications: * ISO/IEC TR 18015:2006 on the use of C++ in embedded systems and on performance implications of C++ language and library features, * ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007 (also known as the C++ Technical Report 1) on library extensions mostly integrated into C++11, * ISO/IEC TR 29124:2010 on special mathematical functions, * ISO/IEC TR 24733:2011 on decimal floating point arithmetic, * ISO/IEC TS 18822:2015 on the standard filesystem library, * ISO/IEC TS 19570:2015 on parallel versions of the standard library algorithms, * ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 on software transactional memory, * ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 on a new set of library extensions, some of which are already integrated into C++17, * ISO/IEC TS 19217:2015 on the C++ concepts, integrated into C++20 * ISO/IEC TS 19571:2016 on the library extensions for concurrency * ISO/IEC TS 19568:2017 on a new set of general-purpose library extensions * ISO/IEC TS 21425:2017 on the library extensions for ranges, integrated into C++20 * ISO/IEC TS 22277:2017 on coroutines * ISO/IEC TS 19216:2018 on the networking library * ISO/IEC TS 21544:2018 on modules * ISO/IEC TS 19570:2018 on a new set of library extensions for parallelism More technical specifications are in development and pending approval, including static reflection.See a list at https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental visited 15 February 2019.  Language  The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as \\"a light- weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions\\"; and \\"offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages.\\" C++ inherits most of C's syntax. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output: #include int main() { std::cout << \\"Hello, world! \\"; } = Object storage = As in C, C++ supports four types of memory management: static storage duration objects, thread storage duration objects, automatic storage duration objects, and dynamic storage duration objects.ISO/IEC. Programming Languages ‚Äì C++11 Draft (n3797) ¬ß3.7 Storage duration [basic.stc]  Static storage duration objects  Static storage duration objects are created before \`main()\` is entered (see exceptions below) and destroyed in reverse order of creation after \`main()\` exits. The exact order of creation is not specified by the standard (though there are some rules defined below) to allow implementations some freedom in how to organize their implementation. More formally, objects of this type have a lifespan that \\"shall last for the duration of the program\\".ISO/IEC. Programming Languages ‚Äì C++11 Draft (n3797) ¬ß3.7.1 Static Storage duration [basic.stc.static] Static storage duration objects are initialized in two phases. First, \\"static initialization\\" is performed, and only after all static initialization is performed, \\"dynamic initialization\\" is performed. In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros; after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression (i.e. variables initialized with a literal or \`constexpr\`). Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data partition of the executable. Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless the function is marked with \`constexpr\`, in C++11). The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the compilation unit (i.e. the same file). No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.  Thread storage duration objects  Variables of this type are very similar to static storage duration objects. The main difference is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined.ISO/IEC. Programming Languages ‚Äì C++11 Draft (n3797) ¬ß3.7.2 Thread Storage duration [basic.stc.thread]  Automatic storage duration objects  The most common variable types in C++ are local variables inside a function or block, and temporary variables.ISO/IEC. Programming Languages ‚Äì C++11 Draft (n3797) ¬ß3.7.3 Automatic Storage duration [basic.stc.auto] The common feature about automatic variables is that they have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable. They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the reverse order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the stack. Local variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed RAII, which is widely used in C++. Member variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an \\"automatic object\\" then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members. Temporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated (usually at the \`;\` at the end of a statement).  Dynamic storage duration objects  These objects have a dynamic lifespan and can be created directly with a call to and destroyed explicitly with a call to .ISO/IEC. Programming Languages ‚Äì C++11 Draft (n3797) ¬ß3.7.4 Dynamic Storage duration [basic.stc.dynamic] C++ also supports \`malloc\` and \`free\`, from C, but these are not compatible with and . Use of returns an address to the allocated memory. The C++ Core Guidelines advise against using directly for creating dynamic objects in favor of smart pointers through for single ownership and for reference-counted multiple ownership, which were introduced in C++11. = Templates = C++ templates enable generic programming. C++ supports function, class, alias, and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile-time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by instantiation at compile-time. To instantiate a template, compilers substitute specific arguments for a template's parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance. Some substitutions are not possible; these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase \\"Substitution failure is not an error\\" (SFINAE). Templates are a powerful tool that can be used for generic programming, template metaprogramming, and code optimization, but this power implies a cost. Template use may increase code size, because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code: one for each set of template arguments, however, this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code was written by hand. This is in contrast to run-time generics seen in other languages (e.g., Java) where at compile- time the type is erased and a single template body is preserved. Templates are different from macros: while both of these compile-time language features enable conditional compilation, templates are not restricted to lexical substitution. Templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language, as well as all compile-time type definitions, and can perform high-level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly type-checked parameters. Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre-compilation text-substitution and text- inclusion/exclusion. In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre-defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols. Templates are a tool for static polymorphism (see below) and generic programming. In addition, templates are a compile time mechanism in C++ that is Turing-complete, meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a template metaprogram prior to runtime. In summary, a template is a compile-time parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it. After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction. = Objects = C++ introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) features to C. It offers classes, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. One distinguishing feature of C++ classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic destructors, which in turn provide support for the Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) concept.  Encapsulation  Encapsulation is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class (\\"friends\\"). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends. The object-oriented principle ensures the encapsulation of all and only the functions that access the internal representation of a type. C++ supports this principle via member functions and friend functions, but it does not enforce it. Programmers can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and they are allowed to make public entities not part of the representation of a type. Therefore, C++ supports not just object-oriented programming, but other decomposition paradigms such as modular programming. It is generally considered good practice to make all data private or protected, and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class. This can hide the details of data implementation, allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way.  Inheritance  Inheritance allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types. Inheritance from a base class may be declared as public, protected, or private. This access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class. Only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by \\"inheritance\\". The other two forms are much less frequently used. If the access specifier is omitted, a \\"class\\" inherits privately, while a \\"struct\\" inherits publicly. Base classes may be declared as virtual; this is called virtual inheritance. Virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph, avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance is a C++ feature not found in most other languages, allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class; this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships. For example, a \\"Flying Cat\\" class can inherit from both \\"Cat\\" and \\"Flying Mammal\\". Some other languages, such as C# or Java, accomplish something similar (although more limited) by allowing inheritance of multiple interfaces while restricting the number of base classes to one (interfaces, unlike classes, provide only declarations of member functions, no implementation or member data). An interface as in C# and Java can be defined in C++ as a class containing only pure virtual functions, often known as an abstract base class or \\"ABC\\". The member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class, not inherited implicitly. C++ virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called dominance. = Operators and operator overloading = { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0.5em 0 1em 2em;\\" + Operators that cannot be overloaded ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\"  Operator ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 9em\\"  Symbol - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\"  Scope resolution operator - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\"  Conditional operator - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\"  dot operator - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\"  Member selection operator - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\"  \\"sizeof\\" operator - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\"  \\"typeid\\" operator } C++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be overloaded for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access (\`.\` and \`.*\`) as well as the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types in C++ seem like built-in types. Overloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming techniques, such as smart pointers. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses (any operand may however be ignored by the operator, though it will be evaluated prior to execution). Overloaded \\"\`&&\`\\" and \\"\`\`\\" operators lose their short-circuit evaluation property. = Polymorphism = Polymorphism enables one common interface for many implementations, and for objects to act differently under different circumstances. C++ supports several kinds of static (resolved at compile-time) and dynamic (resolved at run-time) polymorphisms, supported by the language features described above. Compile- time polymorphism does not allow for certain run-time decisions, while runtime polymorphism typically incurs a performance penalty.  Static polymorphism  Function overloading allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments (i.e. ad hoc polymorphism). The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their formal parameters. Thus, the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used. The type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and would result in a compile-time error message. When declaring a function, a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a default value. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, in which case the default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters. Templates in C++ provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic, polymorphic code (i.e. parametric polymorphism). In particular, through the curiously recurring template pattern, it's possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions. Because C++ templates are type-aware and Turing-complete, they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through template metaprogramming. Contrary to some opinion, template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings.  Dynamic polymorphism  = Inheritance = Variable pointers and references to a base class type in C++ can also refer to objects of any derived classes of that type. This allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types (references cannot be directly held in containers). This enables dynamic (run- time) polymorphism, where the referred objects can behave differently, depending on their (actual, derived) types. C++ also provides the dynamic_cast operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference/pointer, to a more derived type: downcasting. The attempt is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced. (Upcasting, conversion to a more general type, can always be checked/performed at compile-time via static_cast, as ancestral classes are specified in the derived class's interface, visible to all callers.) dynamic_cast relies on run-time type information (RTTI), metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a dynamic_cast to a pointer fails, the result is the nullptr constant, whereas if the destination is a reference (which cannot be null), the cast throws an exception. Objects known to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with static_cast, bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type-checking of dynamic_cast, so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is, and will always be, valid. = Virtual member functions = Ordinarily, when a function in a derived class overrides a function in a base class, the function to call is determined by the type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called dynamic dispatch. Virtual member functions or methods allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using virtual function tables. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a fully qualified class name before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time. In addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual. As a rule of thumb, if any function in the class is virtual, the destructor should be as well. As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual. Nonetheless a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object. In such a case, a common solution is to create a clone() (or similar) virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called. A member function can also be made \\"pure virtual\\" by appending it with = 0 after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an abstract class. Objects cannot be created from an abstract class; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non-pure definition of it (and all other pure virtual functions) before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is ill- formed. = Lambda expressions = C++ provides support for anonymous functions, also known as lambda expressions, with the following form: [capture](parameters) -> return_type { function_body } If the lambda takes no parameters, the () can be omitted, that is, [capture] -> return_type { function_body } Also, the return type of a lambda expression can be automatically inferred, if possible, e.g.: [](int x, int y) { return x + y; } // inferred [](int x, int y) -> int { return x + y; } // explicit The [capture] list supports the definition of closures. Such lambda expressions are defined in the standard as syntactic sugar for an unnamed function object. = Exception handling = Exception handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled. It permits this to be done in a uniform manner and separately from the main code, while detecting all errors. Should an error occur, an exception is thrown (raised), which is then caught by the nearest suitable exception handler. The exception causes the current scope to be exited, and also each outer scope (propagation) until a suitable handler is found, calling in turn the destructors of any objects in these exited scopes. At the same time, an exception is presented as an object carrying the data about the detected problem. Some C++ style guides, such as Google's, LLVM's, and Qt's forbid the usage of exceptions. The exception-causing code is placed inside a try block. The exceptions are handled in separate catch blocks (the handlers); each try block can have multiple exception handlers, as it is visible in the example below. #include #include #include int main() { try { std::vector vec{3, 4, 3, 1}; int i{vec.at(4)}; // Throws an exception, std::out_of_range (indexing for vec is from 0-3 not 1-4) } // An exception handler, catches std::out_of_range, which is thrown by vec.at(4) catch (std::out_of_range &e;) { std::cerr << \\"Accessing a non-existent element: \\" << e.what() << ' '; } // To catch any other standard library exceptions (they derive from std::exception) catch (std::exception &e;) { std::cerr << \\"Exception thrown: \\" << e.what() << ' '; } // Catch any unrecognised exceptions (i.e. those which don't derive from std::exception) catch (...) { std::cerr << \\"Some fatal error \\"; } } It is also possible to raise exceptions purposefully, using the throw keyword; these exceptions are handled in the usual way. In some cases, exceptions cannot be used due to technical reasons. One such example is a critical component of an embedded system, where every operation must be guaranteed to complete within a specified amount of time. This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an exception to be handled. Unlike signal handling, in which the handling function is called from the point of failure, exception handling exits the current scope before the catch block is entered, which may be located in the current function or any of the previous function calls currently on the stack.  Standard library  The draft \\"Working Paper\\" standard that became approved as C++98; half of its size was devoted to the C++ Standard Library The C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types (vectors, lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), algorithms (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation support, smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression support, multi-threading library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that doesn't use C++ exceptions into C++ exceptions, a random number generator and a slightly modified version of the C standard library (to make it comply with the C++ type system). A large part of the C++ library is based on the Standard Template Library (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include containers as the collections of objects (such as vectors and lists), iterators that provide array-like access to containers, and algorithms that perform operations such as searching and sorting. Furthermore, (multi)maps (associative arrays) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the features of the library are accessed by using the #include directive to include a standard header. The C++ Standard Library provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated. The standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by Alexander Stepanov, who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as \\"STL\\", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.). Most C++ compilers, and all major ones, provide a standards-conforming implementation of the C++ standard library.  C++ Core Guidelines  The C++ Core Guidelines are an initiative led by Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, and Herb Sutter, the convener and chair of the C++ ISO Working Group, to help programmers write 'Modern C++' by using best practices for the language standards C++14 and newer, and to help developers of compilers and static checking tools to create rules for catching bad programming practices. The main aim is to efficiently and consistently write type and resource safe C++. The Core Guidelines were announced in the opening keynote at CPPCon 2015. The Guidelines are accompanied by the Guideline Support Library (GSL), a header only library of types and functions to implement the Core Guidelines and static checker tools for enforcing Guideline rules.  Compatibility  To give compiler vendors greater freedom, the C++ standards committee decided not to dictate the implementation of name mangling, exception handling, and other implementation-specific features. The downside of this decision is that object code produced by different compilers is expected to be incompatible. There were, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems (for example C++ ABI), though they seem to be largely abandoned now. = With C = C++ is often considered to be a superset of C but this is not strictly true. Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++ but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C allows implicit conversion from void* to other pointer types but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as new and class, which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program. Some incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard (C99), which now supports C++ features such as line comments (//) and declarations mixed with code. On the other hand, C99 introduced a number of new features that C++ did not support that were incompatible or redundant in C++, such as variable-length arrays, native complex-number types (however, the std::complex class in the C++ standard library provides similar functionality, although not code-compatible), designated initializers, compound literals, and the restrict keyword. Some of the C99-introduced features were included in the subsequent version of the C++ standard, C++11 (out of those which were not redundant). However, the C++11 standard introduces new incompatibilities, such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer, which remains valid C. To intermix C and C++ code, any function declaration or definition that is to be called from/used both in C and C++ must be declared with C linkage by placing it within an extern \\"C\\" {/*...*/} block. Such a function may not rely on features depending on name mangling (i.e., function overloading).  Criticism  Despite its widespread adoption, some notable programmers have criticized the C++ language, including Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Joshua Bloch, Ken Thompson,https://gigamonkeys.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/coders-c-plus-plus/ and Donald Knuth.https://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/an-interview- with-donald-knuth/228700500http://tex.loria.fr/litte/knuth-interview One of the most often criticised points of C++ is its perceived complexity as a language, with the criticism that a large number of non-orthogonal features in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: > I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold, and yet there > are a lot of people programming it. But what you do is you force people to > subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, ‚ÄúYes, > we‚Äôre using C++ but we‚Äôre not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and > we‚Äôre not using operator overloading.‚Äù There are just a bunch of features > that you‚Äôre not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is > too high. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good when you have to start doing that. You > lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else‚Äôs > code, which I think is such a good thing. Donald Knuth (1993, commenting on pre-standardized C++), who said of Edsger Dijkstra that \\"to think of programming in C++\\" \\"would make him physically ill\\": > The problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. > At the moment, it's impossible for me to write portable code that I believe > would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. > Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they > should solve some problem, they said \\"OK, we'll do them both\\". So the > language is too baroque for my taste. Ken Thompson, who was a colleague of Stroustrup at Bell Labs, gives his assessment: > It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it‚Äôs a bad > language. It does a lot of things half well and it‚Äôs just a garbage heap of > ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it‚Äôs personal > or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it‚Äôs not > a good language to transport an algorithm‚Äîto say, ‚ÄúI wrote it; here, take > it.‚Äù It‚Äôs way too big, way too complex. And it‚Äôs obviously built by a > committee. Stroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond > any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it > adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a > whip and a chair. And he said ‚Äúno‚Äù to no one. He put every feature in that > language that ever existed. It wasn‚Äôt cleanly designed‚Äîit was just the union > of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from > that. However Brian Kernighan, also a colleague at Bell Labs, disputes this assessment: > C++ has been enormously influential. ... Lots of people say C++ is too big > and too complicated etc. etc. but in fact it is a very powerful language and > pretty much everything that is in there is there for a really sound reason: > it is not somebody doing random invention, it is actually people trying to > solve real world problems. Now a lot of the programs that we take for > granted today, that we just use, are C++ programs. Stroustrup himself comments that C++ semantics are much cleaner than its syntax: \\"within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out\\".http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#really-say-that Other complaints may include a lack of reflection or garbage collection, long compilation times, perceived feature creep, and verbose error messages, particularly from template metaprogramming.

Origins of the WN family In real life a meteorite, called the Wold Cottage meteorite, fell near Wold Newton, Yorkshire, England, on December 13, 1795. Farmer suggested in two fictional biographies, Tarzan Alive: A Definitive Biography of Lord Greystoke (1972) and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life (1973) that this meteorite caused genetic mutations in the occupants of two passing coaches due to ionization. Many of their descendants were thus endowed with extremely high intelligence and strength, as well as an exceptional capacity and drive to perform good or, as the case may be, evil deeds. The progeny of these travellers are purported to have been the real-life originals of fictionalised characters, both heroic and villainous, over the last few hundred years. =Members of the WN family= As well as Tarzan and Doc Savage, both Lord Peter Wimsey and Sherlock Holmes are descendants of the original families. Other popular characters included by Farmer as members of the Wold Newton family are Solomon Kane; Captain Blood; The Scarlet Pimpernel; Sherlock Holmes's nemesis Professor Moriarty; Phileas Fogg; The Time Traveller (main character of The Time Machine by H. G. Wells); Allan Quatermain; A. J. Raffles; Professor Challenger; Richard Hannay; Bulldog Drummond; the evil Fu Manchu and his adversary, Sir Denis Nayland Smith; G-8; The Shadow; Sam Spade; Doc Savage's cousin Patricia Savage and one of his five assistants, Monk Mayfair; The Spider; Nero Wolfe; Mr. Moto; The Avenger; Philip Marlowe; James Bond; Lew Archer; Travis McGee; Monsieur Lecoq; and Ars√®ne Lupin. The Wold Newton Universe The Wold Newton Universe (or WNU) is a term coined by Win Scott Eckert to denote an expansion of Philip Jos√© Farmer's original Wold Newton Family concept (introduced in Tarzan Alive [1972]). Eckert introduced the term in 1997 on his website, An Expansion of Philip Jos√© Farmer's Wold Newton Universe. Eckert and others use Farmer's concept of the Wold Newton Family as a unifying device and expands the universe that the Wold Newton Family inhabits by including essays in the vein of the Sherlockian \\"Game,\\" in which theories are proposed and supported by supplying contextual background information and persuasive argument; by writing fiction authorized by Farmer and Farmer's Estate which adds elements and characters to the Wold Newton Family and/or the WNU; by writing other fiction which contains \\"Easter egg\\" references to the Wold Newton Family or the WNU, or which otherwise expands the overall mythos; and by documenting crossovers between fictional characters from various media and genres. Characters incorporated into the WNU are not necessarily blood relatives, descendants, or ancestors of the coach travelers present at the 1795 Wold Cottage meteor strike, but these characters all exist in the same shared fictional universe. Farmer himself penned a number of stories and novels set in what is now termed the Wold Newton Universe; not all characters in Farmer's Wold Newton fiction are core members of the Wold Newton Family, but all are linked into the larger WNU via connections with Farmer's primary Wold Newton Family works, Tarzan Alive and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life.Win Scott Eckert's Wold Newton Universe website. Accessed January 18, 2008 =Depowering superheroes= Among the membership of the WNU are comic book superheroes and supervillains whose published exploits, by their very nature, often prove difficult to reconcile with Farmer's original framework. But WNU‚Äôs root conceit has always been that characters known by the reader as fictional actually lived or are yet living, with their adventures based on true events embroidered by the genre authors who serve as their \\"biographers.\\" Therefore, in order for aspects of larger fictional universes to adhere to WNU‚Äôs overall continuity and believability, certain accounts of these new characters' lives have been labeled as a distortion of actual events or dismissed as complete fabrication. =Additional genres= Eckert and other post-Farmerian authors‚Äîadmirers of Farmer's Wold Newton biographies and fiction who write in Eckert‚Äôs vein‚Äîhave published numerous further fictional characters in many literary styles and media, including works emulating the aesthetics of the Renaissance, Romantic and Victorian eras; such subgenres of prose fiction as Gothic and steampunk; the fairy tale, mythology and folklore categories of traditional stories; publication formats like the graphic novel, the comic book, the pulp magazine and the penny dreadful; and the non-print media of motion pictures, television shows, radio programs and video games. WNU references The expanded WNU is documented in articles by WNU experts on the various WNU-themed websites; in Myths for the Modern Age: Philip Jos√© Farmer's Wold Newton Universe (edited by Win Scott Eckert, MonkeyBrain Books, 2005, a 2007 Locus Award finalist); in various issues of Farmerphile: The Magazine of Philip Jos√© Farmer, the prozine dedicated to and authorized by Farmer and published by Michael Croteau, webmaster of the Official Philip Jos√© Farmer Home Page ; and in various stories, novellas, and novels authorized by Farmer or by Farmer's Estate, such as Tales of the Wold Newton Universe (edited by Win Scott Eckert and Christopher Paul Carey, Titan Books, 2013) and various books published by Meteor House.Meteor House: Our Books. Accessed August 21, 2015 Going beyond the WNU is Eckert's Crossover Universe, published in book form by Black Coat Press in two volumes in 2010 as Crossovers: A Secret Chronology of the World, in which a massive continuity is created in a \\"six degrees\\" game of linked crossover stories. Eckert's Crossover Universe work is being carried forward by Sean Levin.The Crossover Universe.

Scott-Giles, an expert in heraldry who served as Fitzalan Pursuivant of Arms Extraordinary,The London Gazette: no. 41163. p. 5101. 30 August 1957 published a history of Lord Peter Wimsey's family, going back to 1066 (but describing the loss of the family tree going back to Adam and Eve); the book is based on material from Scott-Giles's correspondence with Dorothy L. Sayers, who wrote at least two of the family anecdotes in the book, one of them in mediaeval French. For details, see Duke of Denver. Warren Ellis's comic book series Planetary has a similar premise of fitting many different superhero, science fiction, and fantasy elements into the same universe. (For the most part, constrained by the needs of the story and copyright, Ellis does not use the originals but rather his own re-interpretations of the archetypes). Author Kim Newman has stated that his Anno Dracula series was partially inspired by the Wold Newton family.Anno Dracula: The Background The anthology series Tales of the Shadowmen edited by Jean-Marc Lofficier is also based on the Wold Newton concept and includes characters from French literature. Alan Moore did likewise in his The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comic book (and its sequels), in which various Victorian-era literary characters meet and join the eponymous League (though they are not descended from a single family). Over the course of the series, the world of the League incorporates many works of fiction from many different eras - not just Victorian literature - into its universe. Moore calls the Wold Newton stories \\"a seminal influence upon the League\\".Mondo Moore: Sinclair's Norton & Remembering Farmer References External links *The Official Philip Jos√© Farmer's Home Page *An Expansion of Philip Jos√© Farmer's Wold Newton Universe *Philip Jos√© Farmer's Wold Newton Family Category:Fictional families Category:Fictional elements introduced in 1972 ","title":"Wold Newton family"},{"id":"72067","text":"Champ is the short form of champion.

Charvaka holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism and rejects ritualism, and supernaturalism. It was a very popular belief system in India before the emergence of Jain and Buddhist tradition. Brihaspati is traditionally referred to as the founder of Charvaka or LokƒÅyata philosophy, although some scholars dispute this. During the Hindu reformation period in the 600 BCE, when Buddhism and Jainism arose, the philosophy was well documented and opposed by the new religions. Much of the primary literature of Charvaka, the Barhaspatya sutras, were lost either due to waning popularity or other unknown reasons. Its teachings have been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras, sutras, and the Indian epic poetry as well as in the dialogues of Gautama Buddha and from Jain literature. However, there is text that may belong to the Charvaka tradition, written by the skeptic philosopher JayarƒÅ≈õi Bha·π≠·π≠a, known as the Tattv√¥paplava-si·πÅha, that provides information about this school, albeit unorthodox. One of the widely studied principles of Charvaka philosophy was its rejection of inference as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and metaphysical truths. In other words, the Charvaka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional. Charvaka is categorized as a heterodox school of Indian philosophy. It is considered an example of atheistic schools in the Hindu tradition. Etymology and meaning The etymology of Charvaka (Sanskrit: ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï) is uncertain. Bhattacharya quotes the grammarian Hemacandra, to the effect that the word cƒÅrvƒÅka is derived from the root , ‚Äòto chew‚Äô : ‚ÄúA CƒÅrvƒÅka chews the self (carvatyƒÅtmƒÅna·πÉ cƒÅrvƒÅka·∏•). Hemacandra refers to his own grammatical work, U·πáƒÅdis≈´tra 37, which runs as follows: mavƒÅka-≈õyƒÅmƒÅka-vƒÅrtƒÅka-jyontƒÅka-g≈´vƒÅka-bhadrƒÅkƒÅdaya·∏•. Each of these words ends with the ƒÅka suffix and is formed irregularly.‚Äù This may also allude to the philosophy's hedonistic precepts of \\"eat, drink, and be merry\\". Others believe it to mean \\"agreeable speech\\" or pejoratively, \\"sweet-tongued\\", from Sanskrit's \\"agreeable\\" and \\"speech\\" (which becomes in the nominative singular and in compounds). Yet another hypothesis is that it is eponymous, with the founder of the school being Charvaka, a disciple of Brihaspati. =As Lokayata= According to claims of , the traditional name of Charvaka is Lokayata. It was called Lokayata because it was prevalent () among the people (), and meant the world-outlook of the people. The dictionary meaning of LokƒÅyata (‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§) signifies \\"directed towards, aiming at the world, worldly\\". In early to mid 20th century literature, the etymology of Lokayata has been given different interpretations, in part because the primary sources are unavailable, and the meaning has been deduced from divergent secondary literature. The name LokƒÅyata, for example, is found in Chanakya's Arthashastra, which refers to three ƒÅnvƒ´k·π£ikƒ´s (‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§ø‡§ï‡•Ä, literally, examining by reason, logical philosophies) ‚Äì Yoga, Samkhya and LokƒÅyata. However, LokƒÅyata in the Arthashastra is not anti-Vedic, but implies LokƒÅyata to be a part of Vedic lore. LokƒÅyata here refers to logic or science of debate (disputatio, \\"criticism\\"). Rudolf Franke translated Lokayata in German as \\"logisch beweisende Naturerkl√§rung\\", that is \\"logically proving explanation of nature\\". In 8th century CE Jaina literature, Saddarsanasamuccaya by Haribhadra, Lokayata is stated to be the Hindu school where there is \\"no God, no samsara (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin.\\" The Buddhist Sanskrit work Divyavadana (ca. 200‚Äì350 CE) mentions Lokayata, where it is listed among subjects of study, and with the sense of \\"technical logical science\\". Shantarakshita and Adi Shankara use the word lokayata to mean materialism, with the latter using the term LokƒÅyata, not Charvaka. In SilƒÅ·πÖka's commentary on S≈´tra-k·πõtƒÅ·πÖgna, the oldest Jain ƒÄgama Prakrt literature, he has used four terms for CƒÅrvƒÅka viz. (1) B·πõhaspatya (2) LokƒÅyata (3) Bh≈´tavƒÅdin (4) VƒÅmamƒÅrgin. Origin The tenets of the Charvaka atheistic doctrines can be traced to the relatively later composed layers of the Rigveda, while substantial discussions on the Charvaka is found in post- Vedic literature. The primary literature of Charvaka, such as the Brhaspati Sutra is missing or lost. Its theories and development has been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras (such as the Arthashastra), sutras and the epics (the Mahabharata and Ramayana) of Hinduism as well as from the dialogues of Gautama Buddha and Jain literature. Substantial discussions about the Charvaka doctrines are found in texts during 600 BCE because of emergence of competing philosophies such as Buddhism and Jainism. Bhattacharya posits that Charvaka may have been one of several atheistic, materialist schools that existed in ancient India during the 600 BCE. Though there is evidence of its development in Vedic era, Charvaka school of philosophy predated the ƒÄstika schools as well as a philosophical predecessor to subsequent or contemporaneous philosophies such as Aj√±ana, ƒÄjƒ´vika, Jainism and Buddhism in the classical period of Indian philosophy. The earliest Charvaka scholar in India whose texts still survive is Ajita Kesakambali. Although materialist schools existed before Charvaka, it was the only school which systematised materialist philosophy by setting them down in the form of aphorisms in the 6th century BCE. There was a base text, a collection s≈´tras or aphorisms and several commentaries were written to explicate the aphorisms. This should be seen in the wider context of the oral tradition of Indian philosophy. It was in the 600 BCE onwards, with the emergent popularity of Buddhism that ancient schools started codifying and writing down the details of their philosophy. E. W. Hopkins, in his The Ethics of India (1924) claims that Charvaka philosophy predated Jainism and Buddhism, mentioning \\"the old CƒÅrvƒÅka or materialist of the 6th century BC\\". Rhys Davids assumes that lokƒÅyata in ca. 500 BC came to mean \\"skepticism\\" in general without yet being organised as a philosophical school. This proves that it had already existed for centuries and had become a generic term by 600 BCE. Its methodology of skepticism is included in the Ramayana, Ayodhya kanda, chapter 108, where JabƒÅli tries to persuade RƒÅma to accept the kingdom by using nƒÅstika arguments (RƒÅma refutes him in chapter 109): There are alternate theories behind the origins of Charvaka. B·πõhaspati is sometimes referred to as the founder of Charvaka or LokƒÅyata philosophy, although other scholars dispute this. states that a philosopher named Charvaka lived in or about the 6th century BCE, who developed the premises of this Indian philosophy in the form of Brhaspati Sutra. These sutras predate 150 BC, because they are mentioned in the MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya (7.3.45). , citing the Buddhist Sama√±√±aphala Sutta, suggests six schools of heterodox, pre-Buddhist and pre-Jain, atheistic Indian traditions in 6th century BCE, that included Charvakas and Ajivikas. Charvaka was a living philosophy up to the 12th century in India's historical timeline, after which this system seems to have disappeared without leaving any trace. Philosophy The Charvaka school of philosophy had a variety of atheistic and materialistic beliefs. They held perception and direct experiments to be the valid and reliable source of knowledge. =Epistemology= The Charvaka epistemology holds perception as the primary and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either right or wrong and therefore conditional or invalid. Perceptions are of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt. Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that is suspect ‚Äì sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable means by which the efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established. Charvaka's epistemological argument can be explained with the example of fire and smoke. Kamal states that when there is smoke (middle term), one's tendency may be to leap to the conclusion that it must be caused by fire (major term in logic). While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. In this Indian philosophy such a method of reasoning, that is jumping to conclusions or inference, is prone to flaw. Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached when we know all observations, all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe. They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error. Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology. This epistemological proposition of Charvakas was influential among various schools of in Indian philosophies, by demonstrating a new way of thinking and re-evaluation of past doctrines. Hindu, Buddhist and Jain scholars extensively deployed Charvaka insights on inference in rational re-examination of their own theories. Comparison with other schools of Hinduism Charvaka epistemology represents minimalist pramƒÅ·πáas (epistemological methods) in Hindu philosophy. The other schools of Hinduism developed and accepted multiple valid forms of epistemology. To Charvakas, Pratyak·π£a (perception) was the one valid way to knowledge and other means of knowledge were either always conditional or invalid. Advaita Vedanta scholars considered six means of valid knowledge and to truths: Pratyak·π£a (perception), AnumƒÅna (inference), UpamƒÅna (comparison and analogy), ArthƒÅpatti (postulation), Anupalabdhi (non-perception, cognitive proof) and ≈öabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). While Charvaka school accepted just one, the valid means of epistemology in other schools of Hinduism ranged between 2 and 6. =Metaphysics= Since none of the means of knowing were found to be worthy to establish the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something else could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences. Therefore, Charvakas denied metaphysical concepts like reincarnation, an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of religious rites, other worlds (heaven and hell), fate and accumulation of merit or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Charvakas also rejected the use of supernatural causes to describe natural phenomena. To them all natural phenomena was produced spontaneously from the inherent nature of things. =Consciousness and afterlife= The Charvaka did not believe in karma, rebirth or an afterlife. To them, all attributes that represented a person, such as thinness, fatness etc., resided in the body. The Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha states the Charvaka position as follows, =Pleasure= Charvaka believed that there was nothing wrong with sensual pleasure. Since it is impossible to have pleasure without pain, Charvaka thought that wisdom lay in enjoying pleasure and avoiding pain as far as possible. Unlike many of the Indian philosophies of the time, Charvaka did not believe in austerities or rejecting pleasure out of fear of pain and held such reasoning to be foolish. The Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha states the Charvaka position on pleasure and hedonism as follows, =Religion= Charvakas rejected many of the standard religious conceptions of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Ajivakas, such as an afterlife, reincarnation, samsara, karma and religious rites. They were critical of the Vedas, as well as Buddhist scriptures. The Sarvadar≈õanasa·πÉgraha with commentaries by Madhavacharya describes the Charvakas as critical of the Vedas, materialists without morals and ethics. To Charvakas, the text states, the Vedas suffered from several faults ‚Äì errors in transmission across generations, untruth, self- contradiction and tautology. The Charvakas pointed out the disagreements, debates and mutual rejection by karmakanda Vedic priests and j√±ƒÅnakanda Vedic priests, as proof that either one of them is wrong or both are wrong, as both cannot be right. Charvakas, according to Sarvadar≈õanasa·πÉgraha verses 10 and 11, declared the Vedas to be incoherent rhapsodies whose only usefulness was to provide livelihood to priests. They also held the belief that Vedas were invented by man, and had no divine authority. Charvakas rejected the need for ethics or morals, and suggested that \\"while life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on ghee even though he runs in debt\\". The Jain scholar Haribhadra, in the last section of his text Saddarsanasamuccaya, includes Charvaka in his list of six dar≈õanas of Indian traditions, along with Buddhism, Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Jainism and Jaiminiya. Haribhadra notes that Charvakas assert that there is nothing beyond the senses, consciousness is an emergent property, and that it is foolish to seek what cannot be seen. The accuracy of these views, attributed to Charvakas, has been contested by scholars. =Public administration= An extract from Aaine-Akbari (vol.III, tr. by H. S. Barrett, pp217‚Äì218) written by Abul Fazl, the famous historian of Akbar's court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar's instance. The account is given by the historian Vincent Smith, in his article titled \\"The Jain Teachers of Akbar\\". Some Carvaka thinkers are said to have participated in the symposium. Under the heading \\"Nastika\\" Abul Fazl has referred to the good work, judicious administration and welfare schemes that were emphasised by the Charvaka law-makers. Somadeva has also mentioned the Charvaka method of defeating the enemies of the nation. Works No independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found except for a few s≈´tras composed by Brihaspati. The 8th century Tattvopaplavasimha of JayarƒÅ≈õi Bha·π≠·π≠a with Madhyamaka influence is a significant source of Charvaka philosophy. Shatdarshan Samuchay and Sarvadar≈õanasa·πÖÃágraha of Vidyaranya are a few other works which elucidate Charvaka thought. In the epic Mahabharata, Book 12 Chapter 39, a villain who dresses up like a scholar, appoints himself as spokesperson for all scholars, and who then advises Yudhishthira to act unethically, is named Charvaka. One of the widely studied references to the Charvaka philosophy is the Sarva-dar≈õana-sa·πÖgraha (etymologically all- philosophy-collection), a famous work of 14th century Advaita Vedanta philosopher MƒÅdhava VidyƒÅra·πáya from South India, which starts with a chapter on the Charvaka system. After invoking, in the Prologue of the book, the Hindu gods Shiva and Vishnu (\\"by whom the earth and rest were produced\\"), VidyƒÅra·πáya asks, in the first chapter: Sanskrit poems and plays like the Nai·π£adha-carita, Prabodha-candrodaya, ƒÄgama-dambara, Vidvanmoda-tara·πÖgi·πáƒ´ and KƒÅdambarƒ´ contain representations of the Charvaka thought. However, the authors of these works were thoroughly opposed to materialism and tried to portray the Charvaka in unfavourable light. Therefore, their works should only be accepted critically. =Loss of original works= There was no continuity in the Charvaka tradition after the 12th century. Whatever is written on Charvaka post this is based on second-hand knowledge, learned from preceptors to disciples and no independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found. Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Charvaka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of its ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition: > \\"Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India, > and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, > the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any > systematic work on materialism, nor any organised school of followers as the > other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other > schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of > Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.\\" =Controversy on reliability of sources= states that the claims against Charvaka of hedonism, lack of any morality and ethics and disregard for spirituality is from texts of competing religious philosophies (Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism). Its primary sources, along with commentaries by Charvaka scholars is missing or lost. This reliance on indirect sources raises the question of reliability and whether there was a bias and exaggeration in representing the views of Charvakas. Bhattacharya points out that multiple manuscripts are inconsistent, with key passages alleging hedonism and immorality missing in many manuscripts of the same text. The Skhalitapramathana Yuktihetusiddhi by ƒÄryadevapƒÅda, in a manuscript found in Tibet, discusses the Charvaka philosophy, but attributes a theistic claim to Charvakas - that happiness in this life, and the only life, can be attained by worshiping gods and defeating demons. Toso posits that as Charvaka philosophy's views spread and were widely discussed, non-Charvakas such as ƒÄryadevapƒÅda added certain points of view that may not be of the Charvakas'. Buddhists, Jains, Advaita Vedantins and NyƒÅya philosophers considered the Charvakas as one of their opponents and tried to refute their views. These refutations are indirect sources of Charvaka philosophy. The arguments and reasoning approach Charvakas deployed were significant that they continued to be referred to, even after all the authentic Charvaka/LokƒÅyata texts had been lost. However, the representation of the Charvaka thought in these works is not always firmly grounded in first-hand knowledge of Charvaka texts and should be viewed critically. Likewise, states Bhattacharya, the charge of hedonism against Charvaka might have been exaggerated. Countering the argument that the Charvakas opposed all that was good in the Vedic tradition, states, \\"It may be said from the available material that CƒÅrvƒÅkas hold truth, integrity, consistency, and freedom of thought in the highest esteem.\\" Commentators Aviddhakar·πáa, Bhavivikta, Kambalasvatara, Purandara and Udbhatabhatta are the five commentators who developed the Carvaka/Lokayata system in various ways.

In the text, the Mughal historian Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak summarizes the Charvaka philosophy as \\"unenlightened\\" and characterizes their works of literature as \\"lasting memorials to their ignorance\\". He notes that Charvakas considered paradise as \\"the state in which man lives as he chooses, without control of another\\", while hell as \\"the state in which he lives subject to another's rule\\". On state craft, Charvakas believe, states Mubarak, that it is best when \\"knowledge of just administration and benevolent government\\" is practiced.

Sayers, the eighth in her series featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. Plot Death Bredon arrives at Pym's Publicity Ltd, an advertising agency, to take up the post of junior copywriter. He is assigned the room of his predecessor Victor Dean, who has died in a fall down the office's iron spiral staircase. The doctor states that death was caused either by a broken neck, due to his landing on his head at the bottom of the stair, or by a wound of the right temple. The death appears suspicious, as the victim apparently made no attempt to save himself as he fell. In Dean's desk Bredon discovers a part-completed letter to the firm's proprietor, Mr Pym, telling him that something 'undesirable' had been going on in the office. Bredon befriends Pamela Dean, sister of the deceased, and takes her to a cocaine-fuelled fancy-dress party hosted by Dian de Momerie, a socialite with whom Dean had been associating. Disguised as Harlequin, Bredon attracts the attention of de Momerie and later meets her several times, always in disguise. His presence annoys de Momerie's companion Major Tod Milligan who is supplying her with drugs. It is revealed that Death Bredon is in fact Lord Peter Wimsey who has been brought in incognito by Pym to investigate. Various clues turn up: a catapult belonging to 'Ginger' Joe, the office boy; a carved stone scarab belonging to Dean; and ¬£50 in banknotes found in the desk of Mr Tallboy, group manager. After having a drink in a Covent Garden pub, newspaper reporter Hector Puncheon discovers that someone has slipped cocaine into his coat pocket. Chief Inspector Charles Parker, Wimsey's brother-in-law, suspects that Puncheon has stumbled on Milligan's drugs gang, but finds no further suspicious activity there. It appears that the cocaine is being distributed from a different pub each week. Puncheon follows a man from the pub, who soon dies after falling in front of a train. In his flat is found a phone book with the names of many pubs ticked off, including the one in Covent Garden. Wimsey realises what has been happening. One of Pym's major clients runs a newspaper advertisement every Friday, the headline for which is approved a few days earlier. The first letter of the headline is being used to indicate the pub for that week, with Tallboy covertly supplying the letter to the gang in advance. Milligan is killed in an 'accident'. But the gang is still operating, and the police want to catch the ringleaders during their next weekly drug distribution. Using the phone book, all they need to find the next pub is the letter for the week ‚Äì as provided by Tallboy. Wimsey is sure that Tallboy killed Victor Dean, but he does not want to act until the gang has been rounded up. On the night of the next drug distribution, Tallboy comes to Wimsey's flat to confess. He says that he was lured into the scheme with an innocent-sounding story and the offer of money, when he was in financial difficulty, but soon became trapped. Dean had found out and was blackmailing him, so Tallboy killed Dean, using Ginger Joe's catapult and the scarab, making it look like an accidental fall on the staircase. Wanting to spare his wife and child, Tallboy proposes suicide. Wimsey, seeing a gang member watching in the street below his window, suggests Tallboy leave, on foot, without looking behind him. Both know that the gang's killers are waiting, and Tallboy is knocked down and killed as he walks home.

Literary significance and criticism In their review of Crime novels (revised edition 1989), the US writers Barzun and Taylor called the novel \\"A superb example of Sayers' ability to set a group of people going. The advertising agency is inimitable, and hence better than the De Momerie crowd that goes with it. The murder is ingenious and Wimsey is just right\\".Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime. New York: Harper & Row. 1971, revised and enlarged edition 1989. Writing in 1993, the biographer Dorothy Reynolds noted that \\"Sayers herself disliked the novel, which she wrote quickly in order to fulfil her publisher's contract, and was unsure whether it would ring true with the reading public\\". Reynolds quotes a letter that Sayers wrote to her publisher Victor Gollancz on 14 September 1932: In her 1941 book The Mind of the Maker Sayers wrote: \\"I undertook (not very successfully) to present a contrast of two 'cardboard' worlds, equally fictitious‚Äîthe world of advertising and the world of the post-war 'Bright Young People'. (It was not very successful, because I knew and cared much more about advertising than about Bright Youth)\\". But she went on to quote a reader who pointed out that \\"Peter Wimsey, who represents reality, never appears in either world except in disguise\\". She commented, \\"It was perfectly true; and I had never noticed it. With all its defects of realism, there had been some measure of integral truth about the book's Idea, since it issued, without my conscious connivance, in a true symbolism\\". Background Most of the action of the novel takes place in an advertising agency, a setting with which Sayers was very familiar as she had herself been employed as a copywriter at S. H. Benson's agency, located at Kingsway from 1922 to 1931. In chapter 12 of the novel she quotes the slogan \\"Guinness is good for you\\", from her own jingle \\"If he can say as you can. / Guinness is good for you / How grand to be a Toucan / Just think what Toucan do\\". Her colleague Bobby Bevan was the inspiration for one of the characters in the novel, Mr Ingleby.Obituary of Natalie Bevan. The Independent. 29 August 2007. Adaptations Murder Must Advertise was adapted by Bill Craig for television in 1973 as a BBC TV mini- series starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey. A six-part radio adaptation by Alistair Beaton was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January 1979, again with Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey.

He probably sighted Resolution Island near Labrador in north-eastern Canada, before entering Frobisher Bay and landing on present-day Baffin Island. On his second voyage, Frobisher found what he thought was gold ore and carried 200 tons of it home on three ships, where initial assaying determined it to be worth a profit of ¬£5.20 per ton. Encouraged, Frobisher returned to Canada with an even larger fleet and dug several mines around Frobisher Bay. He carried 1,350 tons of the ore back to England, where, after years of smelting, it was realised that the ore was a worthless rock called hornblende. As an English privateer, he plundered riches from French ships. He was later knighted for his service in repelling the Spanish Armada in 1588. Early life Martin Frobisher was probably born in 1535 or 1536, the son of merchant Bernard Frobisher of Altofts, Yorkshire, and Margaret York of Gouthwaite. He was the third of five children when his father died prematurely in 1542. The family was left in the care of his uncle, Francis Frobisher. Little else is known of his early life in Yorkshire; his education appears to have been rudimentary. In hopes of better opportunity, young Frobisher was sent to London in 1549 to live with a maternal relative, Sir John York. York was a wealthy and influential member of the Merchant-Taylor Company and had important connections in the royal government. In 1553, Thomas Wyndham led the first English expedition to West Africa, comprising three ships and 140 men. York was an investor in the enterprise and Frobisher accompanied the fleet in an unknown capacity. After plundering Portuguese ships in the vicinity of Madeira, they made their most successful transactions on the Gold Coast, trading English cloth for 150 pounds of gold. Pushing further south they reached Benin and negotiated directly with the local leader, Oba Oroghbua for 80 tons of melegueta pepper. After some initial reluctance, Oroghbua agreed to a trade but while the pepper was being gathered, disease swept through the English crew killing many of them including the expedition leader, Wyndham. Lacking sufficient sailors to crew the entire fleet, they abandoned one ship and in their panic to leave even left behind some members of the expedition. The return voyage was extremely difficult for the sick and short-handed crew. Another ship was lost and when the one remaining ship returned to England only 40 of the original 140 crewmen were still alive. Frobisher was one of the survivors, perhaps a confirmation of York's assessment that Frobisher had \\"great spirit and bould courage, and natural hardnes of body.\\" Despite the loss of two ships and 100 lives, the 1553 voyage was considered a financial success and investors, including York, funded another trading expedition to Portuguese Guinea in 1554. Undaunted by his first experience, Frobisher joined the new expedition and served as an apprentice merchant working for York's trading representative, John Beryn. Three ships left Dartmouth in November 1554 under the command of John Lok. This may have been Frobisher's first acquaintance with the Lok family, a relationship that would play an important role in his future. After seven weeks sailing they made their first landfall near the Cestos River in present-day Liberia. They traded for a quantity of pepper and then proceeded to the Gold Cost, the center of the West African gold trade. The local governor refused to deal with the English until they provided a hostage to ensure negotiations in good faith. Frobisher volunteered to serve as the hostage and discussions were allowed to proceed. However, before they could conclude a deal, a Portuguese ship appeared offshore and fired on the English fleet. The expedition abandoned Frobisher and went elsewhere to trade, eventually returning to England with a valuable cargo of gold, pepper, and ivory. His African captors then handed Frobisher over to the Portuguese at their trading post of Mina, where he was imprisoned in the castle of S√£o Jorge da Mina. After nine months or so, the Portuguese authorities sent him to Portugal, whence he eventually made his way back to England about 1558. Privateer and pirate The circumstances and timing of Frobisher's return from Portugal are unclear. There is no indication of any diplomatic or financial effort to secure his release; perhaps the Portuguese simply saw no advantage to holding a low-ranking political prisoner any longer. Frobisher must have returned to the sea soon after his release. There is some evidence that by 1559 he led a voyage to the Barbary Coast to secure the release of an English hostage, Anthony Hammond. In September of the same year the well-known pirate, Henry Strangways, testified in court that Frobisher had been part of an aborted plot to attack and plunder the Portuguese fortress of Mina where Frobisher had been held captive in 1555. On 30 September 1559 Frobisher married a Yorkshire widow, Isobel Richard, who had two young children and a substantial settlement from her previous marriage to Thomas Rigatt of Snaith. Little is known of their domestic life, but having spent all her inheritance to finance his ventures, Frobisher seems to have left her and her children by the mid-1570s; Isobel's death in a poorhouse in 1588 went unremarked by the ambitious captain. In 1563, Frobisher became involved in a privateering venture with his brother, John Frobisher, and a fellow Yorkshireman, John Appleyard. Appleyard was licensed to seize ships of the French Catholic party and financed a fleet of three vessels. Martin Frobisher captained one vessel and may have been fleet commander. By May 1563, they had seized five French ships and brought them to Plymouth harbor. Frobisher was promptly arrested by officers of the Privy Council on the grounds that his ship had also participated in the seizure of a Spanish ship which resulted in the death of 40 Englishmen. The leader of this attack was the pirate Thomas Cobham, who gave Frobisher the Spanish cargo of tapestries and wine. Possession of these goods was sufficient evidence to land Frobisher in prison. Frobisher was released from prison in 1564 and in 1565 he purchased two ships, the Mary Flower and William Baxter. His stated intention was to outfit the ships for a trading expedition to the Guinea coast. Based on previous experience, officials were skeptical of his motives and when a storm drove him into Scarborough, he was seized along with the William Baxter. His brother, John Frobisher, was captain of the Mary Flower and escaped arrest. Martin Frobisher was once again imprisoned briefly by the admiralty court. On 31 October 1566, Frobisher was again set free on the condition that he refrain from going to sea without a license. In 1568 he commanded the Robert in service to the exiled Cardinal of Chatillon who licensed at least six vessels to prey on French shipping. For a brief time Frobisher associated with other notable privateers including John Hawkins and William Winter. However, Frobisher refused to limit his depredations to French Catholic vessels and also seized Protestant ships carrying English goods. In 1569 he was again arrested by admiralty officers and imprisoned first at Fleet prison and then at Marshalsea. He may have remained there for some time if not for the intervention of the lord admiral, Edward Fiennes de Clinton and the secretary of state, William Cecil. With their help, Frobisher was free again in March 1570.McDermott 1999 pp. 62-63 The terms of his release are unknown but it appears that Frobisher was required to undertake certain assignments at the direction of the Privy Council. In October 1571 he was commissioned to command four ships in the search for pirates and smugglers along the English coast. There is no indication that he had any success in this effort. In 1572 he was directed to the Irish coast to provide logistical support for the English campaign against the Desmond Rebellions.McDermott 1999 pp. 62-63 Starting in 1571 Frobisher was involved in various plots that ran counter to government interest. He possibly had the tacit approval of the Privy Council, suggesting that he may have been working as a double agent. He was briefly associated with a plan to help the Earl of Desmond flee England; then a proposal to lead a group of disaffected English mercenaries to seize Flushing for the Spanish king; and finally, in 1573 a plot to capture the English rebel, Thomas Stukley. According to the Dictionary of National Biography, the first direct notice of Frobisher apparently is an account in the State papers of two interrogations in 1566, \\"on suspicion of his having fitted out a vessel as a pirate\\". On 21 August 1571 Captain E. Horsey wrote to Lord Burghley from Portsmouth that he \\"has expedited the fitting out of a hulk for M. Frobisher\\"; this is the earliest mention of Frobisher being in the Crown's employ. Burghley, then chief minister of the Queen, became Lord High Treasurer in 1572. From the latter part of 1571 to 1572 Frobisher was in the public service at sea off the coast of Ireland. North-west passage Throughout much of the sixteenth century, the feasibility of a northern route to Cathay and the East Indies was debated and tested by England. In 1508 Sebastian Cabot led one of the first expeditions to search for a north-west passage. In the 1530s, Robert Thorne and Roger Barlow tried unsuccessfully to interest Henry VIII in a plan to sail directly over the North Pole to China. In 1551 a company of English merchants (later known as the Muscovy Company) was formed to search for a northeast passage to Cathay. The initiative failed to find a route but did establish a long-lasting trade relationship with Russia. In the 1560s Humphrey Gilbert was an influential advocate for seeking a north-west passage and penned a detailed treatise in support of the idea. Although Frobisher may have expressed interest in a search for the North-west Passage as early as 1560, it was only much later that he actively pursued the idea. In 1574, Frobisher petitioned the Privy Council for permission and financial support to lead an expedition to find a north-west passage to \\"the Southern Sea\\" (the Pacific Ocean) and thence to Cathay. Some of its members were intrigued by his proposal, but cautiously referred him to the Muscovy Company, an English merchant consortium which had previously sent out several parties searching for the North-east Passage around the Arctic coasts of Norway and Russia, and held exclusive rights to any northern sea routes to the East. =First voyage= Greenwich Palace, from a window of which Queen Elizabeth waved to the departing ships (by an unknown artist) In 1576, Frobisher persuaded the Muscovy Company to license his expedition. With the help of the company's director, Michael Lok (whose well-connected father William Lok had held an exclusive mercers' license to provide Henry VIII with fine cloths), Frobisher was able to raise enough capital for three barques: Gabriel and Michael of about 20‚Äì25 tons each, and an unnamed pinnace of ten tons, with a total crew of 35. Queen Elizabeth sent word that she had \\"good liking of their doings\\", and the ships weighed anchor at Blackwall on 7 June 1576. As they headed downstream on the Thames, Elizabeth waved to the departing ships from a window of Greenwich Palace, while cannons fired salutes and a large assembly of the people cheered. On 26 June, the little fleet reached the Shetland Islands, where it stopped to repair a leak in Michael hull and repair the barques' water casks. The ships hoisted sail the same evening and set course westwards, sailing west by north for three days until a violent storm rose and pounded them continuously through 8 July. On 11 July, they sighted the mountains of the southeastern tip of Greenland, which they mistook for the non-existent island called 'Friesland'. Crossing the Davis Strait, they encountered another violent storm in which the pinnace was sunk and Michael turned back to England, but Gabriel sailed on for four days until her crew sighted what they believed was the coast of Labrador. The landmass was actually the southernmost tip of Baffin Island; Frobisher named it \\"Queen Elizabeth's Foreland\\". The ship reached the mouth of Frobisher Bay a few days later, and because ice and wind prevented further travel north, Frobisher determined to sail westwards up the bay, which he believed to be the entrance to the North-west Passage, naming it Frobisher's Strait, to see \\"whether he might carry himself through the same into some open sea on the back side\\". Gabriel sailed north-westwards, keeping in sight of the bay's north shore. On 18 August, Burche's Island was sighted and named after the ship's carpenter who first spied it; there the expedition met some local Inuit. Having made arrangements with one of the Inuit to guide them through the region, Frobisher sent five of his men in a ship's boat to return him to shore, instructing them to avoid getting too close to any of the others. The boat's crew disobeyed, however, and five of Frobisher's men were taken captive. After days of searching, Frobisher could not recover the insubordinate sailors, and eventually took hostage the native man who had agreed to guide the Englishmen to see if an exchange for the missing boat's crew could be arranged. The effort was fruitless, and the men were never seen again by their fellows, but Inuit oral tradition tells that the men lived among them for a few years of their own free will until they died attempting to leave Baffin Island in a self-made boat. Frobisher turned homewards, and was well received by the Queen when he docked in London on 9 October. Among the things which had been hastily brought away by the men was a black stone \\"as great as a half-penny loaf\\" which had been found loose on the surface of Hall's Island off Baffin Island by the ship master, Robert Garrard, who took it to be sea coal, of which they had need.Garrard was one of the five men captured by the Inuit several days later. Frobisher took no account of the black rock but kept it as a token of possession of the new territory. Michael Lok said that Frobisher, upon his return to London from the Arctic, had given him the black stone as the first object taken from the new land. Lok brought samples of the stone to the royal assayer in the Tower of London and two other expert assayers, all of whom declared that it was worthless, saying that it was marcasite and contained no gold. Lok then took the \\"ore\\" to an Italian alchemist living in London, Giovanni Battista Agnello, who claimed it was gold-bearing. Agnello assayed the ore three times and showed Lok small amounts of gold dust; when he was challenged as to why the other assayers failed to find gold in their specimens, Agnello replied, \\"Bisogna sapere adulare la natura\\" (\\"One must know how to flatter nature\\"). Ignoring the negative reports, Lok secretly wrote to the Queen to inform her of the encouraging result, and used this assessment to lobby investors to finance another voyage. Subsequently the stone became the focus of intense attention by the Cathay enterprise's venturers, who saw in it the possibility of vast profits to be derived from mining the rocky islands of Meta Incognita; gossip spread in the court and from there throughout London about the gold powder Agnello was supposedly deriving from the rock. = Second voyage = In 1577, a much bigger expedition than the former was fitted out. The Queen lent the 200-ton Royal Navy ship Ayde to the Company of Cathay (Frobisher's biographer James McDermott says she sold it) and invested ¬£1000 in the expedition. Prior to 30 March, Frobisher petitioned the Queen to be confirmed as High Admiral of the north-western seas and governor of all lands discovered, and to receive five per cent of profits from trade. It is unknown if his request was ever granted. Michael Lok, meanwhile, was petitioning the queen for his own charter, by the terms of which the Company of Cathay would have sole rights to exploit the resources of all seas, islands and lands to the west and north of England, as well as any goods produced by the peoples occupying them; Frobisher would be apportioned a much smaller share of the profits. Lok's request was ignored and a charter never issued, nor was a royal license granted, creating corporate ambiguity that redounded to the Queen's benefit. Besides Ayde, the expedition included the ships Gabriel and Michael; Frobisher's second-in-command aboard Ayde was Lieutenant George Best (who later wrote the most informative account of the three voyages) with Christopher Hall as master, while the navigator Edward Fenton was in command of Gabriel. The learned John Dee, one of the preeminent scholars of England, acquired shares in the Cathay Company's venture, and instructed Frobisher and Hall in the use of navigational instruments and the mathematics of navigation, as well as advising them which books, charts, and instruments the expedition should purchase. The fleet left Blackwall on 27 May and headed down the Thames, ostensibly having, per the instructions of the Privy Council, a maximum complement of 120 men, including 90 mariners, gunners and carpenters to crew the ship, as well as refiners, merchants, and thirty Cornish miners; this figure included a group of convicts to be expatriated and put to use as miners in the new lands. Frobisher had exceeded the assigned quota of crewmen by at least twenty men, and perhaps by as many as forty. Letters from the Privy Council were waiting for him at Harwich, however, commanding him to trim the excess; consequently he sent the convicts and a number of seamen ashore at the harbour on May 31, and set sail northwards to Scotland. The fleet anchored at St Magnus Sound in the Orkney Islands on 7 June to take on water, and weighed anchor that evening. It enjoyed fair weather and favourable winds on its passage across the Atlantic, and \\"Friesland\\" (southern Greenland) was first sighted on 4 July. Hall and Frobisher each attempted landing in the ship's boat, but were driven back by fog and the certain knowledge of unseen ice in the water before them. John White On 8 July, presented with no opportunity to land, Frobisher set his course westwards. The ships were caught almost immediately in severe storms and separated, each of them lowering their sails for long intervals. They continued this way for several days, tracking before the wind until the weather cleared on 17 July and the fleet was able to regroup, a testament to the skill of the masters. A sailor aboard Ayde spied Hall's Island at the mouth of Frobisher Bay the same evening. The next day, Frobisher and a small party landed at Little Hall's Island in Ayde's pinnace to search for more samples of the black ore acquired originally by Robert Garrard, but found none. On 19 July, Frobisher and forty of his best men landed at Hall's Island and made their way to its highest point, which he dubbed Mount Warwick in honour of the Earl of Warwick, one of the principal investors in the expedition. There they piled a cairn of stones to mark possession of the new land, and prayed solemnly for the success of their venture. Several weeks were now spent in collecting ore, but very little was done in the way of discovery, Frobisher being specially directed by his orders from the Company of Cathay to \\"defer the further discovery of the passage until another time\\". There was much parleying and some skirmishing with the Inuit, and earnest but futile attempts were made to recover the five men captured the previous year. The expedition's return to England commenced on 23 August 1577, and Ayde reached Milford Haven in Wales on 23 September. Gabriel and Michael later arrived separately at Bristol and Yarmouth. Frobisher brought with him three Inuit who had been forcibly taken from Baffin Island: a man called Calichough, a woman, Egnock, and her child, Nutioc. All three died soon after their arrival in England, Calichough dying from a wound suffered when a rib was broken unintentionally during his capture and eventually punctured his lung. The Inuit's names are reported elsewhere as Kalicho, Arnaq and Nuttaaq. Frobisher was received and thanked by the queen at Windsor. Great preparations were made and considerable expense incurred for the assaying of the great quantity of \\"ore\\" (about 200 tons) brought home. This took much time and led to disputes among the various interested parties. =Third voyage= Printed text in German telling of Martin Frobisher's third voyage Meanwhile, the Queen and others in her retinue maintained a strong faith in the potential productivity of the newly discovered territory, which she herself named Meta Incognita (Latin: Unknown Shore). It was resolved to send out the largest expedition yet, with everything necessary to establish a colony of 100 men. Frobisher was again received by the queen, whereupon she threw a chain of fine gold around his neck. The expedition consisted of fifteen vessels: the flagship Ayde, Michael, and Gabriel, as well as Judith, Dennis or Dionyse, Anne Francis, Francis of Foy and Moon of Foy, Bear of Leycester, Thomas of Ipswich, Thomas Allen, Armenall,Sometimes conflated with the Admiral, a by-name for the flagship Aid. Soloman of Weymouth, Hopewell, and Emanuel of Bridgwater. There were over 400 men aboard the ships, with 147 miners, 4 blacksmiths, and 5 assayers in the crew. On 3 June 1578, the expedition left Plymouth and, sailing through the Channel, on 20 June reached the south of Greenland, where Frobisher and some of his men managed to land. On 2 July, the foreland of Frobisher Bay was sighted. Stormy weather and dangerous ice prevented the rendezvous, and, besides causing the wreck on an iceberg of the 100-ton barque Dennis, drove the fleet unwittingly up a waterway that Frobisher named 'Mistaken Strait'. He believed that the strait, now known as Hudson Strait, was less likely to be an entrance to the North-west Passage than Frobisher Bay ('Frobisher's Strait' to him). After proceeding about sixty miles up the new strait, Frobisher with apparent reluctance turned back, and after many buffetings and separations, the fleet at last came to anchor in Frobisher Bay. During this voyage, the vessel Emanuel claimed to have found the phantom Buss Island. Some attempt was made at founding a settlement, and a large quantity of ore was shipped, but dissension and discontent prevented the establishment of a successful colony. On the last day of August, the fleet set out on its return and reached England in the beginning of October, although the vessel Emanuel was wrecked en route at Ard na Caithne on the west coast of Ireland.Discovery of Martin Frobisher's Baffin Island \\"ore\\" in Ireland The ore was taken to a specially constructed smelting plant at Powder Mill Lane in Dartford; assiduous efforts to extract gold and further assays were made over five years, but the ore proved to be a valueless rock known as hornblende and was eventually salvaged for road metalling and wall construction.Ruby 2001 pp. 257-258 The Cathay Company went bankrupt and Michael Lok was ruined, being sent to debtors' prison several times. Anglo-Spanish War Sir Martin Frobisher (British School, Dulwich Picture Gallery) Finding his reputation as an adventurer-explorer damaged following the disastrous outcome of the Cathay Company venture, and that his services in that line were no longer required, Frobisher sought other employment. He applied to a major shareholder in the Arctic enterprise, Sir William Wynter, one of the Queen's most trusted naval commanders, who was leading a fleet of four heavily armed vessels to Ireland under orders to put down the Desmond rebellion against the English Crown. Frobisher secured an appointment as captain of Foresight and sailed in early March 1580; in November, he participated in the Siege of Smerwick at the Dingle Peninsula, a rocky promontory on the southwestern shore of Kerry, where Emanuel had wrecked two years previously. Frobisher joined Francis Drake on his 1585 raids of Spanish ports and shipping in the West Indies as vice- admiral of Drake's fleet, appointed to that position by the Queen; his flagship was the Primrose. Shortly after the voyage began, Frobisher was admitted to a select group of advisors to Drake (together with Christopher Carleill, Nichols, and Fenner). On 20 July, 1588, the Spanish Armada set sail from Corunna in Galicia with the purpose of escorting the Army of Flanders, led by the Duke of Parma, to invade England. Sir Francis Walsingham sent a dispatch to Whitehall stating that the Armada had been sighted in the chops (entrance) of the Channel that day. When the two navies first engaged, Frobisher was in command of Triumph, the Royal Navy's largest ship, leading a consort of the ships Merchant Royal, Margaret and John, Centurion, Golden Lion and Mary Rose. =Spanish Armada= Following a council of war, Lord Howard, the Lord High Admiral of the Fleet, reorganised the English fleet into four squadrons. Frobisher was made commander of one of these and assigned Triumph, as well as Lord Sheffield's White Bear, Lord Thomas Howard's Golden Lion, and Sir Robert Southwell's Elizabeth Jonas, all heavily armed vessels. On the morning of 21 July 1588, Frobisher in Triumph, Drake in Revenge, and Hawkins in Victory attacked the seaward wing of the Spanish defensive formation, damaging San Juan de Portugal, the ship of the Armada's vice-admiral, Juan Mart√≠nez de Recalde, and forcing his rescue by galleasses from the Bizcayan squadron. Later that day Frobisher and Hawkins engaged Pedro de Valdez, commander of the Andalusian squadron, who did not yield his ship, Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario (Our Lady of the Rosary), until Drake came to their assistance the next morning, much to his rival Frobisher's consternation. Three days later, the English fleet was reinforced by Lord Seymour's channel patrol of thirty-five or forty sail, and Frobisher assumed command of his newly formed squadron. Frobisher's squadron was close in shore at dawn on 25 July, the only one landwards of the Armada that morning; the sea was dead calm when he engaged the Duke of Medina Sidonia's flagship San Mart√≠n and gave her another pummeling like that of a few days past. A breeze rose from the south- west, however, allowing several Spanish galleons to move in and save their flagship. The other English ships withdrew in time, but Triumph was caught on the lee shore off Dunnose cape on the Isle of Wight, and more than thirty Armada ships bore down upon him. Frobisher used his boats to manoeuvre Triumph with good effect and managed to escape when the wind shifted again, allowing him the weather gage. Frobisher was knighted 26 July for valour by Lord Howard aboard his flagship Ark Royal, alongside Sheffield, Thomas Howard, and Hawkins. Two days later the English launched eight fire ships into the midst of the Armada at its moorings, forcing its captains to cut their anchors; the decisive action was fought 29 July on the shoals off Gravelines, where Frobisher, Drake, and Hawkins pounded the Spanish ships with their guns. Drake's squadron gave Medina Sidonia's flagship, San Martin, a single broadside and moved on; Frobisher, directly behind him in the English line, stayed with the San Martin at close range and poured cannon shot into her oaken flanks, but failed to take her. Five Spanish ships were lost. Following this defeat of the Spanish fleet, the Revenge was engaged in harassing Spanish shipping and it was Frobisher's flagship in 1590 when he commanded the efforts to intercept Spanish treasure galleons. Later life In 1590, Frobisher visited his native Altofts and found himself welcomed in the homes of the peers and landed gentry of Yorkshire county as an honoured guest. He paid particular attention to a daughter of Thomas, 1st Baron Wentworth, Dorothy Wentworth, 3 January 1601), recently widowed by the death of her husband, Paul Withypool of Ipswich; sometime before October she became Frobisher's second wife. In November 1591, he purchased from the Queen the leasehold of the manor of Whitwood in Yorkshire for an unstated sum, and of Finningley Grange in Nottinghamshire, which had belonged to the Mattersey Priory, for ¬£949. Frobisher made Whitwood his chief residence, befitting his new status as a landed proprietor, but found little leisure for a country life. The following year Frobisher took charge of an English fleet sent out to blockade the Spanish coast and rendezvous with the Spanish treasure fleet; it was fitted out by investors including the Queen, the Earl of Cumberland, Sir Walter Raleigh and his brother, and John Hawkins. Raleigh and Cumberland were the principal organisers of the expedition, and on 28 February Raleigh was commissioned to lead it; the Queen, however, was not eager to send her current favourite off to sea, and he, no great lover of sea life and with no experience in the command of fleets, recommended Frobisher take his place. The fleet was divided into two divisions, with Frobisher's squadron patrolling the waters off the coast of Portugal near the Burlings, while Sir John Burgh (Borrough) and John Norton's squadrons sailed for the Azores where they captured a rich prize, the Madre de Deus, much to the discomfiture of Frobisher when he learned the news. In September 1594, Frobisher led a squadron of ships that besieged Morlaix and forced its surrender. The following month he was engaged with the squadron in the siege and relief of Brest, where he received a gunshot wound to his thigh during the Siege of Fort Crozon, a Spanish-held fortress. The surgeon who extracted the ball left the wadding behind and an ensuing infection resulted in his death days later at Plymouth on 22 November. His heart was buried at St Andrew's Church, Plymouth, and his body was then taken to London and buried at St Giles-without- Cripplegate, Fore Street. Legacy Plaque in St Giles-without-Cripplegate, London =Britain= A destroyer was named during construction but was named when launched in 1915. It was scrapped in 1921. The Royal Navy was named after him. It was scrapped in 1949. A SR Lord Nelson class steam locomotive was named after him. Frobisher Crescent, part of the Barbican Estate in London, is named after Frobisher. A stained glass window placed in memory of him is located in All Saints' Church, Normanton, near his birthplace in Altofts, West Yorkshire.

He was one of the twelve official candidates in the 2007 French presidential election. He served in the European Parliament as a member of the European Greens in the 2009-2014 term, and also for the 2014-2019 term.  Early life  Jos√© Bov√© (Paris, May 2005) Jos√© Bov√© was born in Talence, near Bordeaux, but was raised in many different places. As a child he lived both inside and outside France, including the United States. Bov√© speaks English fluently, as his parents moved with him to Berkeley, California when he was three. They were invited to be researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. After they returned to France, they lived in Paris. Bov√© attended a Jesuit secondary school near Paris (from which he was expelled for being \\"faithless\\"). While at university, he associated with anarchists and pacifists. When asked to serve in the army, he fled France.  Anti-military activist  In 1976 Bov√© joined the Fight for the Larzac, a movement protesting the proposed expansion of a military camp on the Larzac plateau. It would have displaced regional sheep farmers and changed the ecology of the area. He joined a band of peasants occupying the threatened territory and illegally building a sheep barn. The protest eventually succeeded, and the government cancelled the military plan. As a result of that experience, Bov√© became a sheep farmer there, producing Roquefort cheese.  Agricultural unionist  Bov√© continued both as a farmer and an activist. In 1987, he formed the Conf√©d√©ration Paysanne, an agricultural union. It promotes the quality of life for humans and the environment, promoting organic farming. In opposition to many companies in the profit-oriented agro-industry, Bov√© is a prominent opponent of genetically modified organisms (GMO). In 1995 he joined Greenpeace on their ship, the Rainbow Warrior, in a voyage to protest nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Ocean. He has also been part of the anarchist organization Alternative Libertaire. Bov√© and the Conf√©d√©ration gained national and international attention in 1999 by dismantling a McDonald's franchise that was under construction in Millau (Aveyron). Considered by his supporters to be non-violent, Bov√© designed this protest against new US restrictions on importing Roquefort cheese and other products, which were harming the farmers who live from these products, and to raise awareness about McDonald's' use of hormone-treated beef. Bov√© was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for his role; he was imprisoned for 44 days and released early on 1 August 2002. Later, the European Union imposed restrictions on importing hormone-treated beef (see Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement). However, the World Trade Organization, of which both the US and France are members, disallowed this restriction. After the EU refused to comply and remove the restrictions, the United States placed punitive tariffs on the importation of certain European goods, including Roquefort cheese, in retaliation.  Alter-globalization activist  Jos√© Bov√© at an anti-GMO protest in March 2006 During an interview by Lynn Jeffress for Z magazine in June 2001, Bov√© explained why he destroyed the McDonald's, saying: \\"This is a fight against free trade global capitalism. It's about the logic of a certain economic system, not an American system. It can be a struggle against any country, this one or that one.\\" Bov√© has participated in numerous anti- globalization movements. In June 1997 he took part in the first anti-GM mowing. The same year that he took part in destruction of the McDonald's, he attended the protests in Seattle against the World Trade Organization meeting. Bov√© became a figure of anti-globalization. Since then, he has redoubled his efforts in the world peasant and anti-globalization movements. He has said that he does not oppose the WTO and global rules,Jose Bove, Le monde n'est pas une marchandise and agrees there is a need for such forms. But his resistance, as stated by his followers, is directed against the lack of democracy in how these rules are developed, approved and implemented. Bov√© is a founding member of ATTAC. In 2001 Bov√© took part in a major action destroying genetically modified crops in Brazil. In 2005 he campaigned for a \\"No\\" vote in the French referendum on the EU Constitution; the proposal was defeated.  Controversies  In April 2002 Bov√© was at the head of an activist group arriving in the West Bank to protest the massive Israeli Army operation (\\"Operation Defensive Shield\\" in official Israeli terminology) conducted at that time. It caused many Palestinian casualties. The group entered Yassir Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah, at the time besieged by Israeli forces. Bov√© joined with members of the newly established International Solidarity Movement (ISM), who were acting as \\"human shields\\" at the Palestinian Presidential Compound so as to deter the army from breaking in. After spending a day in the besieged headquarters, Bov√© came out and was promptly arrested and deported by Israeli police. Upon his return to France, he was met by dozens of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrators, who scuffled briefly at Paris' Orly airport. In an interview in 2002 with TV channel Canal Plus, Bov√© said he believed that the wave of attacks against French synagogues was being either arranged or fabricated by Mossad (the Israeli secret service). \\"Who profits from the crime?\\" Bov√© asked. \\"The Israeli government and its secret services have an interest in creating a certain psychosis, in making believe that there is a climate of antisemitism in France, in order to distract attention from what they are doing.\\" Considerable outrage was expressed after his remarks, and he later apologized for the statement. His visit to Arafat was denounced in a speech by the head of France's CRIF, an umbrella group for Jewish organisations. Bov√© has intervened to support the movements of the Tahitians and the Kanaks, the indigenous Melanesian people of New Caledonia. On 23 April 2004 he announced that he would join the People's Congress of Kurdistan (Kongra-Gel). This group has been classified as terrorist by both the European Union and the United States State Department.  Civil disobedience  In 1976, Bov√© was sentenced and served three weeks of imprisonment for having destroyed documents belonging to the military, when opposing extension of Larzac military camp. In 2002, Bov√© was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for his role in the 1999 destruction of a McDonald's franchise in Millau, Aveyron. He served 44 days and was released on 1 August 2002. On 22 June 2003 Bov√© began serving a sentence of ten months for the destruction of transgenic crops. ATTAC protested and called for him to be freed. A general pardon of prisoners issued for Bastille Day, together with an individual action in his case by President Jacques Chirac, reduced the sentence to seven months. Both supporters and opponents expressed dissatisfaction with the Presidential pardon, saying that it was entirely inadequate and wholly unjustified, respectively. On 15 November 2005 the Toulouse court of appeals sentenced Bov√© to 4 months in jail for having destroyed genetically engineered corn from a field. Other defendants, such as No√´l Mam√®re, got suspended sentences. In February 2006, Bov√© was stopped at entry by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at New York's JFK Airport. He was traveling to Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations for events sponsored by Cornell's Global Labor Institute. According to Bov√©, the Customs agents told him he was \\"ineligible\\" to enter the U.S. due to his past prosecutions for \\"moral crimes.\\" After being detained for several hours, Bov√© was placed on an Air France flight to Paris. On 11 October 2016, Bov√© was denied entry to Canada because of his convictions related to protests, notably against McDonald's. He was subsequently allowed to stay in the country for seven days.  Political life  15 April 2007 electoral meeting in Paris Following an appeal from his supporters, who gathered 40,000 signatures, in January 2007 Bov√© announced he would run as a candidate that year in the 2007 French presidential election. He formally declared on 1 February and in six weeks gained the required 500 signatures from elected officials necessary to be a candidate.

Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck, 8th Laird of Auchinleck (1706‚Äì1782) was a judge of the supreme courts of Scotland. He was the father of the author and biographer James Boswell, and grandfather of songwriter Sir Alexander Boswell. Alexander Boswell was the eldest son of James Boswell (ca. 1672-1749), 7th Laird of Auchinleck. He attended the University of Edinburgh, read Civil Law at the University of Leyden and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1727. Auchinleck House He was appointed Sheriff of Wigtown in 1748 but resigned the position in 1750 after inheriting the Auchinleck estate in Ayrshire on the death of his father. There he built the present Adam-style Auchinleck House. Alexander was nominated to the Court of Session in 1754, receiving the additional appointment to the High Court of Justiciary in the following year. As a judge he took the courtesy title Lord Auchinleck from the name of his estate, of which he was the 8th Laird. He is noted for rescuing of the Auchinleck manuscript in 1740 from a professor of the University of Aberdeen who was in the process of destroying it. He donated the manuscript to the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh. He is known for frequently arguing with his son, James Boswell, upon matters such as Boswell's career choice, his publishing methods and routes of travel, his friends and even his choice of wife. Family He married Euphemia Erskine (1718-1766) in 1738; their children included James, John (1743-1798) and (Thomas) David (1748-1826). John joined the Army but was obliged to resign on the grounds of insanity. Thomas David was a merchant trading with Spain before becoming head of the Prize Department of the Navy. After Euphemia's death in 1766 he married his cousin Elizabeth Boswell on the same day as his son James' marriage in 1769.

Clinical psychology is a field of applied psychology that focus on therapeutic methods. Other applied fields include counseling psychology and school psychology. Licensing and regulations can vary by state and profession. = Clinical psychology =  Education and training  In the United States and Canada, full membership in the American Psychological Association requires doctoral training (except in some Canadian provinces, such as Alberta, where a master's degree is sufficient). The minimal requirement for full membership can be waived in circumstances where there is evidence that significant contribution or performance in the field of psychology has been made. Associate membership requires at least two years of postgraduate studies in psychology or an approved related discipline.APA Membership information. Apa.org. Retrieved on 22 November 2011. The University of Pennsylvania was the first institution to offer formal education in clinical psychology. in U.S. Some U.S. schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a master's degree. Such programs can range from forty-eight to eighty-four units, most often taking two to three years to complete after the undergraduate degree. Training usually emphasizes theory and treatment over research, quite often with a focus on school, or couples and family counseling. Similar to doctoral programs, master's level students usually must fulfill time in a clinical practicum under supervision; some programs also require a minimum amount of personal psychotherapy.Antioch University. (2006). Master of Arts in Psychology Program Options & Requirements . While many graduates from master's level training go on to doctoral psychology programs, a large number also go directly into practice‚Äîoften as a licensed professional counselor (LPC), marriage and family therapist (MFT), or other similar licensed practice. There is stiff competition to gain acceptance into clinical psychology doctoral programs (acceptance rates of 2-5% are not uncommon). Clinical psychologists in the U.S. undergo many years of graduate training‚Äîusually five to seven years after the bachelor's degree‚Äîto gain demonstrable competence and experience. Licensure as a psychologist takes an additional one to two years post Ph.D./Psy.D. (licensure requires 3,000 hours of supervised training), depending on the state. Today in America, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in Ph.D. programs that emphasize research and are conducted by universities‚Äîwith the other half in Psy.D. programs, which have more focus on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law).Norcross, J. & Castle, P. (2002)..Appreciating the PsyD: The Facts. Eye on Psi Chi, 7(1), 22-26. Both types of doctoral programs (Ph.D. and Psy.D.) envision practicing clinical psychology in a research-based, scientifically valid manner, and most are accredited by the American Psychological Association. APA accreditation is very important for U.S. clinical, counseling, and school psychology programs because graduating from a non-accredited doctoral program may adversely affect employment prospects and present a hurdle for becoming licensed in some jurisdictions. Doctorate (Ph.D. and Psy.D.) programs usually involve some variation on the following 5 to 7 year, 90-120 unit curriculum: :*Bases of behavior‚Äîbiological, cognitive-affective and cultural-social :*Individual differences‚Äîpersonality, lifespan development, psychopathology :*History and systems‚Äîdevelopment of psychological theories, practices and scientific knowledge :*Clinical practice‚Äîdiagnostics, psychological assessment, psychotherapeutic interventions, psychopharmacology, ethical and legal issues :*Coursework in statistics and research design :* Clinical experience :Practicum‚Äîusually three or four years of working with clients under supervision in a clinical setting. Most practicum placements begin in either the first or second year of doctoral training :Doctoral internship‚Äîusually an intensive one or two-year placement in a clinical setting :* Dissertation‚ÄîPh.D. programs usually require original quantitative empirical research, while Psy.D. dissertations involve original quantitative or qualitative research, theoretical scholarship, program evaluation or development, critical literature analysis or clinical application and analysis. The dissertation typically takes 2-3 years to complete. :*Specialized electives‚Äîmany programs offer sets of elective courses for specializations, such as health, child, family, community or neuropsychology :* Personal psychotherapy‚Äîmany programs require students to undertake a certain number of hours of personal psychotherapy (with a non- faculty therapist) although in recent years this requirement has become less frequent. :* Comprehensive exams or master's thesis: A thesis can involve original data collection and is distinct from a dissertation Psychologists can be seen as practicing within two general categories of psychology: applied psychology which includes \\"practitioners\\" or \\"professionals\\", and research- orientated psychology which includes \\"scientists\\", or \\"scholars\\". The training models endorsed by the American Psychological Association (APA) require that applied psychologists be trained as both researchers and practitioners,See: Scientist‚Äìpractitioner model and Practitioner-scholar model and that they possess advanced degrees. Psychologists typically have one of two degrees: PsyD or PhD. The PsyD program prepares the student only for clinical practice (e.g., testing, psychotherapy). Depending on the specialty (industrial/organizational, social, clinical, school, etc.), a PhD may be trained in clinical practice as well as in scientific methodology, to prepare for a career in academia or research. Both the PsyD and PhD programs prepare students to take state licensing exams. Within the two main categories are many further types of psychologists as reflected by the 56 professional classifications recognized by the APA, including clinical, counseling, and school psychologists. Such professionals work with persons in a variety of therapeutic contexts. People often think of the discipline as involving only such clinical or counseling psychologists. While counseling and psychotherapy are common activities for psychologists, these applied fields are just two branches in the larger domain of psychology.What is Psychology? at everydaypsychology.com There are other classifications such as industrial, organizational and community psychologists, whose professionals mainly apply psychological research, theories, and techniques to \\"real-world\\" problems of business, industry, social benefit organizations, government,Spector, P.E (2011).

Most clinical who engage in research and teaching do so within a college or university setting. Clinical psychologists may also choose to specialize in a particular field. = Prescription privileges = Psychologists in the United States campaigned for legislative changes to enable specially trained psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medications. Legislation in Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, New Mexico, and Illinois has granted those who complete an additional master's degree program in psychopharmacology permission to prescribe medications for mental and emotional disorders.Louisiana Psychological Association . Louisianapsychologist.org. Retrieved on 22 November 2011. , Louisiana is the only state where the licensing and regulation of the practice of psychology by medical psychologists (MPs) is regulated by a medical board (the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners) rather than a board of psychologists. While other states have pursued prescriptive privileges, they have not succeeded. Similar legislation in the states of Hawaii and Oregon passed through their respective legislative bodies, but in each case the legislation was vetoed by the state's governor. In 1989, the U.S Department of Defense was directed to create the Psychopharmacology Demonstration Project (PDP). By 1997, ten psychologists were trained in psychopharmacology and granted the ability to prescribe psychiatric medications.  Licensure  The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States and Canada. Although each of the U.S. states is different in terms of requirements and licenses (see and for examples), there are three common requirements: # Graduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree # Completion of supervised clinical experience # Passing a written and/or oral examination All U.S. state, and Canada provincial, licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e. mental health law) examination or an oral examination. Most states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license. Licensees can obtain this through various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops. There are professions whose scope of practice overlaps with the practice of psychology (particularly with respect to providing psychotherapy) and for which a license is required.  Ambiguity of title  To practice with the title of \\"psychologist\\", in almost all cases a doctorate degree is required (a PhD or PsyD in the U.S.). Normally, after the degree, the practitioner must fulfill a certain number of supervised postdoctoral hours ranging from 1,500-3,000 (usually taking one to two years), and passing the EPPP and any other state or provincial exams.Kerewsky, Shoshana. (2000). Some US states also require additional requirements, such as an oral exam and extra coursework Beyond Internship: Helpful Resources for Obtaining Licensure. A professional in the U.S. must hold a graduate degree in psychology (MA, Psy.D., Ed.D., or Ph.D.), or have a state license to use the title psychologist.Becoming a psychologist or psychologist associate Ontario Psychological Association.\\"Currently, all (State) jurisdictions have laws that limit the use of the term psychologist to those who are licensed or who are specifically exempt, as in an exempt setting.\\" (Reference: American Psychological Association (APA) Division 14, Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP)) Additional regulations vary from state to state.  Differences with psychiatrists  Although clinical psychologists and psychiatrists share the same fundamental aim‚Äîthe alleviation of mental distress‚Äîtheir training, outlook, and methodologies are often different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians, and, as such, psychiatrists are apt to use the medical model to assess mental health problems and to also employ psychotropic medications as a method of addressing mental health problems. Psychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although in some jurisdictions they do have prescription privileges. In five US states (New Mexico, Louisiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Idaho), psychologists with post-doctoral clinical psychopharmacology training have been granted prescriptive authority for mental health disorders. Clinical psychologists receive extensive training in psychological test administration, scoring, interpretation, and reporting, while psychiatrists are not trained in psychological testing. In addition, psychologists (particularly those from Ph.D. programs) spend several years in graduate school being trained to conduct behavioral research; their training includes research design and advanced statistical analysis. While this training is available for physicians via dual MD/Ph.D. programs, it is not typically included in standard medical education, although psychiatrists may develop research skills during their residency or a psychiatry fellowship (post-residency). Psychologists from Psy.D. programs tend to have more training and experience in clinical practice (e.g. psychotherapy, testing) than those from Ph.D. programs. Psychiatrists, as licensed physicians, have been trained more intensively in other areas, such as internal medicine and neurology, and may bring this knowledge to bear in identifying and treating medical or neurological conditions that present with primarily psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or paranoia, e.g., hypothyroidism presenting with depressive symptoms, or pulmonary embolism with significant apprehension and anxiety. = Mental health professions = *Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT). An MFT license requires a doctorate or master's degree. In addition, it usually involves two years of post-degree clinical experience under supervision, and licensure requires passing a written exam, commonly the National Examination for Marriage and Family Therapists, which is maintained by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. In addition, most states require an oral exam. MFTs, as the title implies, work mostly with families and couples, addressing a wide range of common psychological problems.American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, Frequently Asked Questions on Marriage and Family Therapists Some jurisdictions have exemptions that let someone practice marriage and family therapy without meeting the requirements for a license. That is, they offer a license but do not require that marriage and family therapists obtain one. *Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). Similar to the MFT, the LPC license requires a master's or doctorate degree, a minimum number of hours of supervised clinical experience in a pre-doc practicum, and the passing of the National Counselor Exam. Similar licenses are the Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor (LCPC), and Clinical Counselor in Mental Health (CCMH). In some states, after passing the exam, a temporary LPC license is awarded and the clinician may begin the normal 3000-hour supervised internship leading to the full license allowing to practice as a counselor or psychotherapist, usually under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Some jurisdictions have exemptions that allow counseling to practice without meeting the requirements for a license. That is, they offer a license but do not require that counselors obtain one. *Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA) Twenty-six states offer a master's-only license, a common one being the LPA, which allows for the therapist to either practice independently, or, more commonly, under the supervision of a licensed psychologist, depending on the state. Common requirements are two to four years of post-master's supervised clinical experience and passing a Psychological Associates Examination. Other titles for this level of licensing include psychological technician (Alabama), psychological assistant (California), licensed clinical psychotherapist (Kansas), licensed psychological practitioner (Minnesota), licensed behavioral practitioner (Oklahoma), licensed psychological associate (North Carolina) or psychological examiner (Tennessee). *Licensed behavior analysts Licensed behavior analysts are licensed in five states to provide services for clients with substance abuse, developmental disabilities, and mental illness. This profession draws on the evidence base of applied behavior analysis and the philosophy of behaviorism. Behavior analysts have at least a master's degree in behavior analysis or in a mental health related discipline, as well as having taken at least five core courses in applied behavior analysis. Many behavior analysts have a doctorate. Most programs have a formalized internship program, and several programs are offered online. Most practitioners have passed the examination offered by the Behavior Analysis Certification Board.Behavior Analyst Certification Board The model licensing act for behavior analysts can be found at the Association for Behavior Analysis International's website. = Employment = In the United States, of 170,200 jobs for psychologists, 152,000 are employed in clinical, counseling, and school positions; 2,300 are employed in industrial-organizational positions, and 15,900 are in \\"all other\\" positions. The median salary in the U.S., in 2012, for clinical, counseling, and school psychologists was US$69,280 and the median salary for organizational psychologists was US$83,580.Clinical, Counseling, and School Psychologists. Bls.gov. Retrieved on 22 November 2011. Psychologists can work in applied or academic settings. Academic psychologists educate higher education students as well as conduct research, with graduate- level research being an important part of academic psychology. Academic positions can be tenured or non-tenured, with tenured positions being highly desirable.  International  To become a psychologist, a person often completes a degree in psychology, but in other jurisdictions the course of study may be different and the activities performed may be similar to those of other professionals.\\"What's the Difference Between a Counselor and a Psychologist?\\" Oregon Unlicensed Practitioners, 27 January 2015 = Australia = In Australia, the psychology profession, and the use of the title \\"psychologist\\", is regulated by an Act of Parliament, the Health Practitioner Regulation (Administrative Arrangements) National Law Act 2008, following an agreement between state and territorial governments. Under this national law, registration of psychologists is administered by the Psychology Board of Australia (PsyBA).Psychology Board of Australia. Psychologyboard.gov.au. Retrieved on 22 November 2011. Before July 2010, the professional registration of psychologists was governed by various state and territorial Psychology Registration Boards. The Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) oversees education standards for the profession. The minimum requirements for general registration in psychology, including the right to use the title \\"psychologist\\", are an APAC approved four-year degree in psychology followed by either a two-year master's program or two years of practice supervised by a registered psychologist. However, AHPRA (Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency) is currently in the process of phasing out the 4 + 2 internship pathway. Once the 4 + 2 pathway is phased out, a master's degree or PhD will be required to become a psychologist in Australia. This is because of concerns about public safety, and to reduce the burden of training on employers. There is also a '5 + 1' registration pathway, including a four-year APAC approved degree followed by one year of postgraduate study and one year of supervised practice. Endorsement within a specific area of practice (e.g. clinical neuropsychology, clinical, community, counselling, educational and developmental, forensic, health, organisational or sport and exercise) requires additional qualifications. These notations are not \\"specialist\\" titles (Western Australian psychologists could use \\"specialist\\" in their titles during a three-year transitional period from 17 October 2010 to 17 October 2013).Specialist titles - Transition provisions for Western Australia psychologists (Server error 404: Content not found), Membership with Australian Psychological Society (APS) differs from registration as a psychologist. The standard route to full membership (MAPS) of the APS usually requires four years of APAC-accredited undergraduate study, plus a master's or doctorate in psychology from an accredited institution. An alternate route is available for academics and practitioners who have gained appropriate experience and made a substantial contribution to the field of psychology. Restrictions apply to all individuals using the title \\"psychologist\\" in all states and territories of Australia. However, the terms \\"psychotherapist\\", \\"social worker\\", and \\"counselor\\" are currently self-regulated, with several organizations campaigning for government regulation.e.g. Australian Counseling Association and Psychotherapy and Counseling Federation of Australia = Belgium = Since 1933, the title \\"psychologist\\" has been protected by law in Belgium. It can only be used by people who are on the National Government Commission list. The minimum requirement is the completion of five years of university training in psychology (master's degree or equivalent). The title of \\"psychotherapist\\" is not legally protected. As of 2016, Belgian law recognizes the clinical psychologist as an autonomous health profession. It reserves the practice of psychotherapy to medical doctors, clinical psychologists and clinical orthopedagogists.Belgium: New Law On Mental Health Professions April 2018 = Canada = A professional in the U.S. or Canada must hold a graduate degree in psychology (MA, Psy.D., Ed.D., or Ph.D.), or have a state license to use the title psychologist. = Finland = In Finland, the title \\"psychologist\\" is protected by law.

There are about 6,200 licensed psychologists in Finland.Finnish Psychological Association - Welcome psyli.fi = Germany = In Germany, the use of the title Diplom- Psychologe (Dipl.-Psych.) is restricted by law, and a practitioner is legally required to hold the corresponding academic title, which is comparable to a M.Sc. degree and requires at least five years of training at a university. Originally, a diploma degree in psychology awarded in Germany included the subject of clinical psychology. With the Bologna-reform, this degree was replaced by a master's degree. The academic degree of Diplom-Psychologe or M.Sc. (Psychologie) does not include a psychotherapeutic qualification, which requires three to five years of additional training. The psychotherapeutic training combines in-depth theoretical knowledge with supervised patient care and self-reflection units. After having completed the training requirements, psychologists take a state-run exam, which, upon successful completion (Approbation), confers the official title of \\"psychological psychotherapist\\" (Psychologischer Psychotherapeut). After many years of inter-professional political controversy, non-physician psychotherapy was given an adequate legal foundation through the creation of two new academic healthcare professions.Vangermain D., Brauchle G.

It can only be used by people who hold a relevant license or certificate, which is issued by the Greek authorities, to practice as a psychologist. The minimum requirement is the completion of university training in psychology at a Greek university, or at a university recognized by the Greek authorities. Psychologists in Greece are legally required to abide by the Code of Conduct of Psychologists (2019). Psychologists in Greece are not required to register with any psychology body in the country in order to legally practice the profession. = India = In India, \\"clinical psychologist\\" is specifically defined in the Mental Health Act, 2017.Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, chap.

This procedure has been criticized by some stakeholders since clinical psychology is not limited to the area of rehabilitation. Titles such as \\"counselor\\" or \\"psychotherapist\\" are not protected at present. In other words, an individual may call themselves a \\"psychotherapist\\" or \\"counselor\\" without having earned a graduate degree in clinical psychology or another mental health field, and without having to register with the Rehabilitation Council of India.Raghuraman, Shruti.

Lokasenna (Old Norse: 'The Flyting of Loki', or 'Loki‚Äôs Verbal Duel') is one of the poems of the Poetic Edda. The poem presents flyting between the gods and Loki. It is written in the lj√≥√∞ah√°ttr metre, typical for wisdom verse. Loki, amongst other things, accuses the gods of moralistic sexual impropriety, the practice of sei√∞r (sorcery), and bias. Not ostensibly the most serious of allegations, these elements are, however, said ultimately to lead to the onset of Ragnar√∂k in the Eddic poem V√∂lusp√°. However, Lokasenna does not directly state that Loki's binding is as a consequence of the killing of Baldr. This is explicitly stated only in Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda. Lee M. Hollander, in his introduction to his translation of the poem, claims that it was in no sense a popular lay and suggests we should not necessarily believe that the accusations of the \\"sly god\\" were an accepted part of the lore. Plot The setting is a feast given by the sea god √Ügir. (In continuity, the prose introduction says: \\"√Ügir, also named Gymir, had made ale for the √Üsir, when he had received the great kettle of which was told\\" (see Hymiskvi√∞a). Thor did not attend, but his wife Sif came in his stead as did Bragi and his wife I√∞unn. Tyr, by this time one-handed as a consequence of his sacrifice of his hand in the shackling of Loki's son, the wolf Fenrisulfr, attended, as did Niord and his wife Ska√∞i, Freyr and Freyja, as well as Vidar, the son of Odin. Many other Vanir, √Üsir, and also elves were there. The servants of √Ügir, Fimafeng and Eldir, did a thorough job of welcoming the guests; Loki was jealous of the praise being heaped upon them and slew Fimafeng. The gods were angry with Loki and drove him out of the hall, before returning to their carousing. On returning Loki encountered Eldir. He threatened him and bade him reveal what the gods were talking about in their cups. Eldir's response was that they were discussing their might at arms, and that Loki was not welcomed. Loki then enters the hall of √Ügir after trading insults and threats with Eldir. A hush falls. Loki calls upon the rules of hospitality, demanding a seat and ale. Bragi then responds that he is unwelcome. Loki demands fulfillment of an ancient oath sworn with Odin that they should drink together. Odin asked his son Vidar to make a space for Loki. Vidar rises and pours a drink for Loki. Before Loki drains his draught, he utters a toast to the gods but pointedly excludes Bragi from it. Bragi offers Loki a horse, a ring and a sword to placate him; Loki, however, is spoiling for a fight, and insults Bragi by questioning his courage. Bragi's response is that it would be contrary to the rules of correct behaviour to fight within his hosts' hall, but were they back in Asgard then things would be different. I√∞unn, Bragi's wife, holds him back. Loki then insults I√∞unn, calling her sexually loose. Gefjon is the next to speak and then Loki turns his spite on her. Odin then attempts to take a grip, as do (in turn), Freyja, Njord, Tyr, Freyr and Byggvir. The exchanges between Odin and Loki are particularly vitriolic. Eventually Thor turns up at the party, and he is not to be placated, nor withheld. Alternating with Loki's insults to him, he says four times that he will use his hammer to knock Loki's head off if he continues. Loki replies that for Thor alone he will leave the hall, because his threats are the only ones he fears. He then leaves. Finally there is a short piece of prose summarizing the tale of Loki's binding, which is told in fuller form in the Gylfaginning section of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda.Ursula Dronke (ed. and trans.), The Poetic Edda Volume II: Mythological Poems, Oxford: Oxford University/Clarendon, 1997, repr. 2001, , p. 371. Loki is chased by the gods, and caught after an unsuccessful attempt at disguising himself as a salmon. The entrails of his son Nari are used to bind him to three rocks above which Ska√∞i places a serpent to drip venom on him. Loki's wife Sigyn remains by his side with a bowl to catch the venom; however, whenever she leaves to empty the bowl, venom falls on Loki, causing him to writhe in agony; this writhing was said to be the cause of earthquakes. The text says that Loki's other son, Narfi, was turned into a wolf, but does not make clear that he tears his brother apart; also in the Gylfaginning version it is a son of Loki named V√°li whom the √Üsir transform into a wolf and who kills Narfi.Dronke, pp. 371-72.\\"Nari and/or Narfi\\", John Lindow, Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs, Oxford/New York: Oxford University, 2001, , pp. 236-37, p. 237. Some editors have therefore chosen to read the names Nari and Narvi as a mistake in the manuscript, and transcribe Nari as V√°li. Nari and Narfi are otherwise considered to be variations of the same name. Excerpts Thorpe's Translation.Thorpe, Benjamin. (Trans.). (1866).

Historically, human population planning has been implemented with the goal of increasing the rate of human population growth. However, in the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about global population growth and its effects on poverty, environmental degradation and political stability led to efforts to reduce human population growth rates. More recently, some countries, such as China, Iran, and Spain, have begun efforts to increase their birth rates once again. While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, most notably the Chinese government's \\"one-child policy and two-child policy\\", have resorted to coercive measures. Types Three types of population planning goals pursued by governments can be identified: # Reducing the overall population growth rate # Decreasing the relative population growth of a less favored subgroup of a national population or ethnic group, such as people of low intelligence or people with disabilities. This is known as eugenics. # Instead of trying to control the rate of population growth per se, trying to arrange things so that all population groups of a certain type (e.g. all social classes within a society) have the same average rate of population growth. Methods While a specific population planning practice may be legal/mandated in one country, it may be illegal or restricted in another, indicative of the controversy surrounding this topic. =Reducing population growth= Population planning that is intended to reduce a population or sub- population's growth rates may promote or enforce one or more of the following practices, although there are other methods: * War (Wars that are done on purpose or in aggression can cause casualties that lower the population. For instance in the Iraq War approximately 1 million people died.)Baker, Luke, \\"Iraq conflict has killed a million Iraqis: survey\\", Reuters, January 30, 2008 * Higher taxation of parents who have too many children * Contraception * Pandemic * AbstinenceWorld infant mortality rates in 2012Infant Mortality Rates in 2012 , UNICEF, 2013. * Reducing infant mortality so that parents do not need to have many children to ensure at least some survive to adulthood.Lifeblood: How to Change the World One Dead Mosquito at a Time, Alex Perry p9 * Abortion * Changing status of women causing departure from traditional sexual division of labour. * Sterilization * One-child and Two- child policies, and other policies restricting or discouraging births directly. * Family planning * Migration from rural areas to urban areas:Urbanization: An Environmental Force to Be Reckoned With having more children is financially more beneficial (for farming families, ...) in rural areas than in urban areas * Create small family \\"role models\\" * Changes to immigration policies * Emigration . The method(s) chosen can be strongly influenced by the religious and cultural beliefs of community members. The failure of other methods of population planning can lead to the use of abortion or infanticide as solutions. = Increasing population growth = Population policies that are intended to increase a population or subpopulation growth rates may use practices such as: * Higher taxation of married couples who have no, or too few, children * Politicians imploring the populace to have bigger families * Tax breaks and subsidies for families with children * Loosening of immigration restrictions, and/or mass recruitment of foreign workers by the government History =Ancient times through Middle Ages= A number of ancient writers have reflected on the issue of population. At about 300 BC, the Indian political philosopher Chanakya (c. 350-283 BC) considered population a source of political, economic, and military strength. Though a given region can house too many or too few people, he considered the latter possibility to be the greater evil. Chanakya favored the remarriage of widows (which at the time was forbidden in India), opposed taxes encouraging emigration, and believed in restricting asceticism to the aged. In ancient Greece, Plato (427-347 BC) and Aristotle (384-322 BC) discussed the best population size for Greek city-states such as Sparta, and concluded that cities should be small enough for efficient administration and direct citizen participation in public affairs, but at the same time needed to be large enough to defend themselves against hostile neighbors. In order to maintain a desired population size, the philosophers advised that procreation, and if necessary, immigration, should be encouraged if the population size was too small. Emigration to colonies would be encouraged should the population become too large. Aristotle concluded that a large increase in population would bring, \\"certain poverty on the citizenry and poverty is the cause of sedition and evil.\\" To halt rapid population increase, Aristotle advocated the use of abortion and the exposure of newborns (that is, infanticide). Confucius (551-478 BC) and other Chinese writers cautioned that, \\"excessive growth may reduce output per worker, repress levels of living for the masses and engender strife.\\" Confucius also observed that, \\"mortality increases when food supply is insufficient; that premature marriage makes for high infantile mortality rates, that war checks population growth.\\" Ancient Rome, especially in the time of Augustus (63 BC-AD 14), needed manpower to acquire and administer the vast Roman Empire. A series of laws were instituted to encourage early marriage and frequent childbirth. Lex Julia (18 BC) and the Lex Papia Poppaea (AD 9) are two well-known examples of such laws, which among others, provided tax breaks and preferential treatment when applying for public office for those that complied with the laws. Severe limitations were imposed on those who did not. For example, the surviving spouse of a childless couple could only inherit one-tenth of the deceased fortune, while the rest was taken by the state. These laws encountered resistance from the population which led to the disregard of their provisions and to their eventual abolition. Tertullian, an early Christian author (ca. AD 160-220), was one of the first to describe famine and war as factors that can prevent overpopulation. He wrote: \\"The strongest witness is the vast population of the earth to which we are a burden and she scarcely can provide for our needs; as our demands grow greater, our complaints against Nature's inadequacy are heard by all. The scourges of pestilence, famine, wars, and earthquakes have come to be regarded as a blessing to overcrowded nations since they serve to prune away the luxuriant growth of the human race.\\" Ibn Khaldun, a North African polymath (1332‚Äì1406), considered population changes to be connected to economic development, linking high birth rates and low death rates to times of economic upswing, and low birth rates and high death rates to economic downswing. Khaldoun concluded that high population density rather than high absolute population numbers were desirable to achieve more efficient division of labour and cheap administration. During the Middle Ages in Christian Europe, population issues were rarely discussed in isolation. Attitudes were generally pro-natalist in line with the Biblical command, \\"Be ye fruitful and multiply.\\" =16th and 17th centuries= European cities grew more rapidly than before, and throughout the 16th century and early 17th century discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of population growth were frequent. Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, an Italian Renaissance political philosopher, wrote, \\"When every province of the world so teems with inhabitants that they can neither subsist where they are nor remove themselves elsewhere... the world will purge itself in one or another of these three ways,\\" listing floods, plague and famine. Martin Luther concluded, \\"God makes children. He is also going to feed them.\\" Jean Bodin, a French jurist and political philosopher (1530‚Äì1596), argued that larger populations meant more production and more exports, increasing the wealth of a country. Giovanni Botero, an Italian priest and diplomat (1540‚Äì1617), emphasized that, \\"the greatness of a city rests on the multitude of its inhabitants and their power,\\" but pointed out that a population cannot increase beyond its food supply. If this limit was approached, late marriage, emigration, and the war would serve to restore the balance. Richard Hakluyt, an English writer (1527‚Äì1616), observed that, \\"Through our longe peace and seldom sickness... we are grown more populous than ever heretofore;... many thousands of idle persons are within this realme, which, having no way to be sett on work, be either mutinous and seek alteration in the state, or at least very burdensome to the commonwealth.\\" Hakluyt believed that this led to crime and full jails and in A Discourse on Western Planting (1584), Hakluyt advocated for the emigration of the surplus population. With the onset of the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48), characterized by widespread devastation and deaths brought on by hunger and disease in Europe, concerns about depopulation returned. Population planning movement In the 20th century, population planning proponents have drawn from the insights of Thomas Malthus, a British clergyman and economist who published An Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798. Malthus argued that, \\"Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence only increases in an arithmetical ratio.\\" He also outlined the idea of \\"positive checks\\" and \\"preventative checks.\\" \\"Positive checks\\", such as diseases, wars, disasters, famines, and genocides are factors which Malthus believed could increase the death rate.Rosenberg, M. (2007, September 09)3-2. Thomas Malthus on Population. Retrieved June 20, 2009, from About.com \\"Geography Web site\\" \\"Preventative checks\\" were factors which Malthus believed could affect the birth rate such as moral restraint, abstinence and birth control. He predicted that \\"positive checks\\" on exponential population growth would ultimately save humanity from itself and he also believed that human misery was an \\"absolute necessary consequence.\\" Malthus went on to explain why he believed that this misery affected the poor in a disproportionate manner. World population growth rate 1950‚Äì2050 Finally, Malthus advocated for the education of the lower class about the use of \\"moral restraint\\" or voluntary abstinence, which he believed would slow the growth rate.Thomas Robert Malthus, 1766-1834 . Retrieved June 20, 2009, from The History of Economic Thought Website Paul R. Ehrlich, a US biologist and environmentalist, published The Population Bomb in 1968, advocating stringent population planning policies. His central argument on population is as follows: World population 1950‚Äì2010 World population 1800-2000 In his concluding chapter, Ehrlich offered a partial solution to the \\"population problem,\\" \\"[We need] compulsory birth regulation... [through] the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired family size\\". Ehrlich's views came to be accepted by many population planning advocates in the United States and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. Since Ehrlich introduced his idea of the \\"population bomb,\\" overpopulation has been blamed for a variety of issues, including increasing poverty, high unemployment rates, environmental degradation, famine and genocide. In a 2004 interview, Ehrlich reviewed the predictions in his book and found that while the specific dates within his predictions may have been wrong, his predictions about climate change and disease were valid. Ehrlich continued to advocate for population planning and co-authored the book The Population Explosion, released in 1990 with his wife Anne Ehrlich. However, it is controversial as to whether human population stabilization will avert environmental risks. Paige Whaley Eager argues that the shift in perception that occurred in the 1960s must be understood in the context of the demographic changes that took place at the time. It was only in the first decade of the 19th century that the world's population reached one billion. The second billion was added in the 1930s, and the next billion in the 1960s. 90 percent of this net increase occurred in developing countries. Eager also argues that, at the time, the United States recognised that these demographic changes could significantly affect global geopolitics. Large increases occurred in China, Mexico and Nigeria, and demographers warned of a \\"population explosion,\\" particularly in developing countries from the mid-1950s onwards. In the 1980s, tension grew between population planning advocates and women's health activists who advanced women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach. Growing opposition to the narrow population planning focus led to a significant change in population planning policies in the early 1990s. Population planning and economics Opinions vary among economists about the effects of population change on a nation's economic health. US scientific research in 2009 concluded that the raising of a child cost about $16,000 yearly ($291,570 total for raising the child to its 18th birthday). In the US, the multiplication of this number with the yearly population growth will yield the overall cost of the population growth. Costs for other developed countries are usually of a similar order of magnitude. Some economists, such as Thomas SowellThomas Sowell Julian Simon, combatant in a 200-year war Thomas Sowell, February 12, 1998 and Walter E. Williams,Population control nonsense Walter Williams, February 24, 1999 have argued that poverty and famine are caused by bad government and bad economic policies, not by overpopulation. In his book The Ultimate Resource, economist Julian Simon argued that higher population density leads to more specialization and technological innovation, which in turn leads to a higher standard of living. He claimed that human beings are the ultimate resource since we possess \\"productive and inventive minds that help find creative solutions to man‚Äôs problems, thus leaving us better off over the long run\\".Moore, S. (1998, March/April). Julian Simon Remembered: it's a Wonderful Life. Retrieved June 25, 2009, from CATO Institute Web site He also claimed that, \\"Our species is better off in just about every measurable material way.\\"Regis, E. (1997, February). The Doomslayer. Retrieved June 20, 2009, from Wired.com site Simon also claimed that when considering a list of countries ranked in order by population density, there is no correlation between population density and poverty and starvation. Instead, if a list of countries is considered according to corruption within their respective governments, there is a significant correlation between government corruption, poverty and famine. Views on population planning =Population increase reductions= Support As early as 1798, Thomas Malthus argued in his Essay on the Principle of Population for implementation of population planning. Around the year 1900, Sir Francis Galton said in his publication Hereditary Improvement: \\"The unfit could become enemies to the State if they continue to propagate.\\" In 1968, Paul Ehrlich noted in The Population Bomb, \\"We must cut the cancer of population growth\\", and \\"if this was not done, there would be only one other solution, namely the 'death rate solution' in which we raise the death rate through war-famine-pestilence, etc.‚Äù In the same year, another prominent modern advocate for mandatory population planning was Garrett Hardin, who proposed in his landmark 1968 essay Tragedy of the commons, society must relinquish the \\"freedom to breed\\" through \\"mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.\\" Later on, in 1972, he reaffirmed his support in his new essay \\"Exploring New Ethics for Survival\\", by stating, \\" We are breeding ourselves into oblivion.\\" Many prominent personalities, such as Bertrand Russell, Margaret Sanger (1939), John D. Rockefeller, Frederick Osborn (1952), Isaac Asimov, Arne N√¶ssNicholas Goodrick-Clarke (1998). Hitler's Priestess: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth, and Neo-Nazism. NY: New York University Press, and Jacques Cousteau have also advocated for population planning.

In 2007, Jeffrey Sachs gave a number of lectures (2007 Reith Lectures) about population planning and overpopulation. In his lectures, called \\"Bursting at the Seams\\", he featured an integrated approach that would deal with a number of problems associated with overpopulation and poverty reduction. For example, when criticized for advocating mosquito nets he argued that child survival was, \\"by far one of the most powerful ways,\\" to achieve fertility reduction, as this would assure poor families that the smaller number of children they had would survive.BBC.co.uk Bursting at the Seams Opposition The Roman Catholic Church has opposed abortion, sterilization, and artificial contraception as a general practice but especially in regard to population planning policies. Pope Benedict XVI has stated, \\"The extermination of millions of unborn children, in the name of the fight against poverty, actually constitutes the destruction of the poorest of all human beings.\\" The reformed Theology pastor Dr. Stephen Tong also opposes the planning of human population.

Pro- natalist policies In 1946, Poland introduced a tax on childlessness, discontinued in the 1970s, as part of natalist policies in the Communist government. From 1941 to the 1990s, the Soviet Union had a similar tax to replenish the population losses incurred during the Second World War. The Socialist Republic of Romania under Nicolae Ceau»ôescu severely repressed abortion, (the most common birth control method at the time) in 1966,.. and forced gynecological revisions and penalties for unmarried women and childless couples. The surge of the birth rate taxed the public services received by the decre≈£ei 770 (\\"Scions of the Decree 770\\") generation. A consequence of Ceau»ôescu's natalist policy is that large numbers of children ended up living in orphanages, because their parents could not cope. The vast majority of children who lived in the communist orphanages were not actually orphans, but were simply children whose parents could not afford to raise them. The Romanian Revolution of 1989 preceded a fall in population growth. =Balanced birth policies= Nativity in the Western world dropped during the interwar period. Swedish sociologists Alva and Gunnar Myrdal published Crisis in the Population Question in 1934, suggesting an extensive welfare state with universal healthcare and childcare, to increase overall Swedish birth rates, and level the number of children at a reproductive level for all social classes in Sweden. Swedish fertility rose throughout World War II (as Sweden was largely unharmed by the war) and peaked in 1946. Modern practice by country =Australia= Australia currently offers fortnightly Family Tax Benefit payments plus a free immunization scheme, and recently proposed to pay all child care costs for women who want to work. =China= One-child era (1979‚Äì2015) The most significant population planning system in the world was China's one-child policy, in which, with various exceptions, having more than one child was discouraged. Unauthorized births were punished by fines, although there were also allegations of illegal forced abortions and forced sterilization.Arthur E. Dewey, Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees and Migration Testimony before the House International Relations Committee Washington, DC December 14, 2004 As part of China's planned birth policy, (work) unit supervisors monitored the fertility of married women and may decide whose turn it is to have a baby.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0081) The Chinese government introduced the policy in 1978 to alleviate the social and environmental problems of China.Pascal Rocha da Silva, \\"La politique de l'enfant unique en R√©publique Populaire de Chine\\", 2006, Universit√© de Gen√®ve, pp. 22‚Äì28, cf. Sinoptic.ch According to government officials, the policy has helped prevent 400 million births. The success of the policy has been questioned, and reduction in fertility has also been attributed to the modernization of China. The policy is controversial both within and outside of China because of its manner of implementation and because of concerns about negative economic and social consequences e.g. female infanticide. In oriental cultures, the oldest male child has responsibility of caring for the parents in their old age. Therefore, it is common for oriental families to invest most heavily in the oldest male child, such as providing college, steering them into the most lucrative careers, and so on. To these families, having an oldest male child is paramount, so in a one-child policy, a daughter has no economic benefit, so daughters, especially as a first child, is often targeted for abortion or infanticide. China introduced several government reforms to increase retirement payments to coincide with the one-child policy. During that time, couples could request permission to have more than one child. According to Tibetologist Melvyn Goldstein, natalist feelings run high in China's Tibet Autonomous Region, among both ordinary people and government officials. Seeing population control \\"as a matter of power and ethnic survival\\" rather than in terms of ecological sustainability, Tibetans successfully argued for an exemption of Tibetan people from the usual family planning policies in China such as the one-child policy. Two-child era (2016-) Map of population density by country, per square kilometer In November 2014, the Chinese government allowed its people to conceive a second child under the supervision of government regulation. On October 29, 2015, the ruling Chinese Communist Party announced that all one-child policies would be scrapped, allowing all couples to have two children. The change was needed to allow a better balance of male and female children, and to grow the young population to ease the problem of paying for the aging population. The law enacting the two-child policy took effect on January 1, 2016, and replaced the previous one-child policy. =Hungary= The Second Orb√°n Government made saving the nation from the demographic abyss a key aspect and therefore has introduced generous breaks for large families and greatly increased social benefits for all families. Those with three or more children pay virtually no taxes. In just a couple years, Hungary went from being one of the countries that spend the least on families in the OECD to being one of those that do so the most.Visegrad Insight - The V4‚Äôs greatest existential threat - Demographic decline and an ageing population - Filip Mazurczak - August 5, 2014 In 2015, it was almost 4% of GDP.OECD - Public spending on family benefits =India= Only those with two or fewer children are eligible for election to a local government. Us two, our two (\\"Hum do, hamare do\\" in Hindi) is a slogan meaning one family, two children and is intended to reinforce the message of family planning thereby aiding population planning. Facilities offered by government to its employees are limited to two children. The government offers incentives for families accepted for sterilization. Moreover, India was the first country to take measures for family planning back in 1952. =Iran= After the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Iran encouraged married couples to produce as many children as possible to replace population lost to the war. Iran succeeded in sharply reducing its birth rate from the late 1980s to 2010. Mandatory contraceptive courses are required for both males and females before a marriage license can be obtained, and the government emphasized the benefits of smaller families and the use of contraception.Iran's Birth Rate Plummeting at Record Pace This changed in 2012, when a major policy shift back towards increasing birth rates and against population planning was announced. In 2014, permanent contraception and advertising of birth control were to be outlawed. =Israel= In Israel, Haredi families with many children receive economic support through generous governmental child allowances, government assistance in housing young religious couples, as well as specific funds by their own community institutions. Haredi women have an average of 6.7 children while the average Jewish Israeli woman has 3 children. =Japan= Japan has experienced a shrinking population for many years. The government is trying to encourage women to have children or to have more children ‚Äì many Japanese women do not have children, or even remain single. The population is culturally opposed to immigration. Some Japanese localities, facing significant population loss, are offering economic incentives. Yamatsuri, a town of 7 000 just north of Tokyo, offers parents $4 600 for the birth of a child and $460 a year for 10 years. =Myanmar= In Myanmar, the Population planning Health Care Bill requires some parents to space each child three years apart. The measure is expected to be used against the persecuted Muslim Rohingyas minority. = Russia = Russian President Vladimir Putin directed Parliament in 2006 to adopt a 10-year program to stop the sharp decline in Russia's population, principally by offering financial incentives and subsidies to encourage women to have children. = Singapore = Singapore has undergone two major phases in its population planning: first to slow and reverse the baby boom in the Post-World War II era; then from the 1980s onwards to encourage couples to have more children as the birth rate had fallen below the replacement-level fertility. In addition, during the interim period, eugenics policies were adopted. The anti-natalist policies flourished in the 1960s and 1970s: initiatives advocating small families were launched and developed into the Stop at Two programme, pushing for two-children families and promoting sterilisation. In 1984, the government announced the Graduate Mothers' Scheme, which favoured children of more well-educated mothers; the policy was however soon abandoned due to the outcry in the general election of the same year. Eventually, the government became pro-natalist in the late 1980s, marked by its Have Three or More plan in 1987. Singapore pays $3,000 for the first child, $9,000 in cash and savings for the second; and up to $18,000 each for the third and fourth. =Spain= In 2017, the government of Spain appointed Edelmira Barreira, as \\"minister for sex\\", in a pro-natalist attempt to reverse a negative population growth rate. =Turkey= In May 2012, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan argued that abortion is murder and announced that legislative preparations to severely limit the practice are underway. Erdogan also argued that abortion and C-section deliveries are plots to stall Turkey's economic growth. Prior to this move, Erdogan had repeatedly demanded that each couple have at least three children. =United States= Enacted in 1970, Title X of the Public Health Service Act provides access to contraceptive services, supplies and information to those in need. Priority for services is given to people with low incomes. The Title X Family Planning program is administered through the Office of Population Affairs under the Office of Public Health and Science. It is directed by the Office of Family Planning.Office of Population Affairs In 2007, Congress appropriated roughly $283 million for family planning under Title X, at least 90 percent of which was used for services in family planning clinics. Title X is a vital source of funding for family planning clinics throughout the nation, which provide reproductive health care, including abortion. The education and services supplied by the Title X-funded clinics support young individuals and low-income families. The goals of developing healthy families are accomplished by helping individuals and couples decide whether to have children and when the appropriate time to do so would be. Title X has made the prevention of unintended pregnancies possible. It has allowed millions of American women to receive necessary reproductive health care, plan their pregnancies and prevent abortions. Title X is dedicated exclusively to funding family planning and reproductive health care services. Title X as a percentage of total public funding to family planning client services has steadily declined from 44% of total expenditures in 1980 to 12% in 2006. Medicaid has increased from 20% to 71% in the same time. In 2006, Medicaid contributed $1.3 billion to public family planning. In the early 1970s, the United States Congress established the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future (Chairman John D. Rockefeller III), which was created to provide recommendations regarding population growth and its social consequences. The Commission submitted its final recommendations in 1972, which included promoting contraceptives and liberalizing abortion regulations, for example. Natalism in the United States In a 2004 editorial in The New York Times, David Brooks expressed the opinion that the relatively high birthrate of the United States in comparison to Europe could be attributed to social groups with \\"natalist\\" attitudes.. The article is referred to in an analysis of the Quiverfull movement.. However, the figures identified for the demographic are extremely low. Former US Senator Rick Santorum made natalism part of his platform for his 2012 presidential campaign. Many of those categorized in the General Social Survey as \\"Fundamentalist Protestant\\" are more or less natalist, and have a higher birth rate than \\"Moderate\\" and \\"Liberal\\" Protestants. However, Rick Santorum is not a Protestant but a practicing Catholic. =Uzbekistan= It is reported that Uzbekistan has been pursuing a policy of forced sterilizations, hysterectomies and IUD insertions since the late 1990s in order to impose population planning.Birth Control by Decree in Uzbekistan IWPR Institute for War & Peace Reporting, published 2005-11-18, accessed 2012-04-12BBC News: Uzbekistan's policy of secretly sterilising women BBC, published 2012-04-12, accessed 2012-04-12Crossing Continents: Forced Sterilisation in Uzbekistan BBC, published 2012-04-12, accessed 2012-04-12Uzbeks Face Forced Sterilization The Moscow Times published 2010-03-10, accessed 2012-04-12Shadow Report: UN Committee Against Torture United Nations, authors Rapid Response Group and OMCT, published November 2007, accessed 2012-04-12 See also * Antinatalism * Birth control * Eugenics * Human overpopulation * List of population concern organizations * Malthus' Dismal Theorem * Overconsumption * Steady-state economy * Pledge two or fewer (campaign for small families) * Planet of the Humans * Voluntary Human Extinction Movement =Fiction= * Logan's Run - State-mandated euthanasia at 21 for all people (30 in the film) to conserve resources * Make Room!

Many scholars underscore that this approach supported colonialism and eurocentrism, and devalued human agency in non-Western societies.Gilmartin, M. (2009). \\"Colonialism/Imperialism\\". Key concepts in political geography (pp. 115‚Äì123). London: SAGE. Jared Diamond, Jeffrey Herbst, Ian Morris, and other social scientists sparked a revival of the theory during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This \\"neo-environmental determinism\\" school of thought examines how geographic and ecological forces influence state-building, economic development, and institutions. A history of thought =Classical and medieval periods= Early theories of environmental determinism in Ancient China, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome suggested that environmental features completely determined the physical and intellectual qualities of whole societies. Guan Zhong (720‚Äì645 BC), an early chancellor in China, held that the qualities of major rivers shaped the character of surrounding peoples. Swift and twisting rivers made people \\"greedy, uncouth, and warlike\\".trans. Allyn Rickett (1998), in Guanzi: Political, Economic, and Philosophical Essays from Early China: A Study and Translation. Volume II. Princeton University Press, p. 106. The ancient Greek philosopher Hippocrates wrote a similar account in his treatise \\"Airs, Waters, Places\\".Benjamin Isaac, The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity Princeton: Princeton University Press. 2004 Writers in the medieval Middle East also produced theories of environmental determinism. The Afro-Arab writer al-Jahiz argued that the skin color of people and livestock were determined by the water, soil, and heat of their environments. He compared the color of black basalt in the northern Najd to the skin color of the peoples living there to support his theory. Ibn Khaldun, the Arab sociologist and polymath, similarly linked skin color to environmental factors. In his Muqaddimah (1377), he wrote that black skin was due to the hot climate of sub-Saharan Africa and not due to African lineage. He thereby challenged Hamitic theories of race that held that the sons of Ham (son of Noah) were cursed with black skin. Many writings of Ibn Khaldun were translated during the colonial era in order to advance the colonial propaganda machine.Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist, by Abdelmajid Hannoum ¬© 2003 Wesleyan University. Ibn Khaldun believed that the physical environment influenced non-physical factors in addition to skin color. He argued that soil, climate, and food determined whether people were nomadic or sedentary, and what customs and ceremonies they held. His writings may have influenced the later writings of Montesquieu during the 18th century through the traveller Jean Chardin, who travelled to Persia and described theories resembling those of Ibn Khaldun. =Western colonial period= Environmental determinism has been widely criticized as a tool to legitimize colonialism, racism, and imperialism in Africa, North America, South America, and Asia. Environmental determinism enabled geographers to scientifically justify the supremacy of white European races and the naturalness of imperialism.Painter & Jeffrey, \\"Political Geography\\", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.177. The scholarship bolstered religious justifications and in some cases superseded them during the late 19th century.J.A. Campbell & D.N. Livingstone, \\"Neo-Lemarckism and the Development of Geography in the United States and Great Britain,\\" Transactions of the Institute of British Geographersxbxs 8 (1983): 278 Many writers, including Thomas Jefferson, supported and legitimized African colonization by arguing that tropical climates made the people uncivilized. Jefferson argued that tropical climates encouraged laziness, relaxed attitudes, promiscuity and generally degenerative societies, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle and northern latitudes led to stronger work ethics and civilized societies. Adolf Hitler also made use of this theory to extol the supremacy of the Nordic race. Defects of character supposedly generated by tropical climates were believed to be inheritable under the Lamarckian theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, a discredited precursor to the Darwinian theory of natural selection. The theory begins with the observation that an organism faced with environmental pressures may undergo physiological changes during its lifetime through the process of acclimatization. Lamarckianism suggested that those physiological changes may be passed directly to offspring, without the need for offspring to develop the trait in the same manner.Lamarck, 1809: 124 in Ernst Mayr, \\"Lamarck Revisited,\\" Journal of the History of Biology 5 (1972): 79‚Äì80. Geographical societies like the Royal Geographical Society and the Soci√©t√© de g√©ographie supported imperialism by funding explorers and other colonial proponents.Gilmartin, M. (2009). \\"Colonialism/Imperialism\\". Key concepts in political geography (pg 117). London: SAGE. Scientific societies acted similarly. Acclimatization societies directly supported colonial enterprises and enjoyed their benefits. The writings of Lamarck provided theoretical backing for the acclimatization doctrines. The Soci√©t√© Zoologique d'Acclimatation was largely founded by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire‚Äîson of √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a close colleague and supporter of Lamarck.Osborne, Michael A. \\"Acclimatizing the World: A History of the Paradigmatic Colonial Science.\\" Osiris 15 (2000): 138, 143. Ellen Churchill Semple, a prominent environmental determinism scholar, applied her theories in a case study which focused on the Philippines, where she mapped civilization and wildness onto the topography of the islands. Other scholars argued that climate and topography caused specific character traits to appear in a given populations. Scholars thereby imposed racial stereotypes on whole societies. Imperial powers rationalized labor exploitation by claiming that tropical peoples were morally inferior.Shirlow, Peter, Gallaher, Carolyn, Gilmartin, Mary, \\"Key Concepts in Political Geography\\", SAGE Publications Ldt, 2009, pg.127. The role of environmental determinism in rationalizing and legitimizing racism, ethnocentrism and economic inequality has consequently drawn strong criticism.Painter & Jeffrey, \\"Political Geography\\", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.200. Many modern scientists have also critiqued classical environmental determinism as unscientific. Carl Sauer criticized the premature generalizations resulting from bias in environmentalism in 1924. He argued that to define geography as the study of environmental influences is to assume in advance that such influences do operate, and that science cannot be based upon or committed to preconceptions. Furthermore, since evolutionary change manifests over very long time periods, some argue that the ability to adequately correlate human behaviour with any specific environmental condition is speculative at best and impossible at worst. David Landes similarly condemns of what he terms the unscientific moral geography of Ellsworth Huntington. He argues that Huntington undermined geography as a science by attributing all human activity to physical influences so that he might classify civilizations hierarchically ‚Äì favoring those civilizations he considered best. =Late-20th-century growth of neo-environmental determinism= Environmental determinism was revived in the late-twentieth century as neo-environmental determinism. The new term coined by the social scientist and critic Andrew Sluyter. Sluyter argues that neo-environmental determinism does not sufficiently break with its classical and imperial precursors. Neo-environmental determinism examines how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular trajectories of economic and political development. It explores how geographic and ecological forces influence state-building, economic development, and institutions. It also addresses fears surrounding the effects of modern climate change. Jared Diamond was influential in the resurgence of environmental determinism due to the popularity of his book Guns, Germs, and Steel, which addresses the geographic origins of state formation prior to 1500 A.D. Neo-environmental determinism scholars debate how much the physical environment shapes economic and political institutions. Economic historians Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff argue that factor endowments greatly affected \\"institutional\\" development in the Americas, by which they mean the tendency to more free (democratic, free market) or unfree (dictatorial, economically restrictive) regimes. In contrast, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson underscore that the geographic factors most influenced institutional development during early state formation and colonialism. They argue that geographic differences cannot explain economic growth disparities after 1500 A.D. directly, except through their effects on economic and political institutions. Economists Jeffrey Sachs and John Luke Gallup have examined the direct impacts of geographic and climatic factors on economic development, especially the role of geography on the cost of trade and access to markets, the disease environment, and agricultural productivity. The contemporary global warming crisis has also impacted environmental determinism scholarship. Jared Diamond draws similarities between the changing climate conditions that brought down the Easter Island civilization and modern global warming in his book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. Alan Kolata, Charles Ortloff, and Gerald Huag similarly describe the Tiwanaku empire and Maya civilization collapses as caused by climate events such as drought. Peter deMenocal, Just as the earthworks in the deserts of the west grew out of notions of landscape painting, the growth of public art stimulated artists to engage the urban landscape as another environment and also as a platform to engage ideas and concepts about the environment to a larger audience. A scientist at the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, writes that societal collapse due to climate change is possible today.  Ecological and geographic impacts on early state formation  =Effects of species endowments, climate, and continental axes prior to 1500= In the Pulitzer Prize winning Guns, Germs, and Steel (1999), author Jared Diamond points to geography as the answer to why certain states were able to grow and develop faster and stronger than others. His theory cited the natural environment and raw materials a civilization was blessed with as factors for success, instead of popular century old claims of racial and cultural superiority. Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication. Diamond argues that early states located along the same latitude lines were uniquely suited to take advantage of similar climates, making it easier for crops, livestock, and farming techniques to spread. Crops such as wheat and barley were simple to grow and easy to harvest, and regions suitable for their cultivation saw high population densities and the growth of early cities. The ability to domesticate herd animals, which had no natural fear of humans, high birth rates, and an innate hierarchy, gave some civilizations the advantages of free labor, fertilizers, and war animals. The east‚Äìwest orientation of Eurasia allowed for knowledge capital to spread quickly, and writing systems to keep track of advanced farming techniques gave people the ability to store and build upon a knowledge base across generations. Craftsmanship flourished as a surplus of food from farming allowed some groups the freedom to explore and create, which lead to the development of metallurgy and advances in technology. While the advantageous geography helped to develop early societies, the close proximity in which humans and their animals lived led to the spread of disease across Eurasia. Over several centuries, rampant disease decimated populations, but ultimately led to disease resistant communities. Diamond suggests that these chains of causation led to European and Asian civilizations holding a dominant place in the world today. Diamond uses the Spanish conquistadors' conquering of the Americas as a case study for his theory. He argues that the Europeans took advantage of their environment to build large and complex states complete with advanced technology and weapons. The Incans and other native groups were not as blessed, suffering from a north‚Äìsouth orientation that prevented the flow of goods and knowledge across the continent. The Americas also lacked the animals, metals, and complex writing systems of Eurasia which prevented them from achieving the military or biological protections needed to fight off the European threat. Diamond's theory has not gone without criticism. * It was notably attacked for not providing enough detail regarding causation of environmental variables, and for leaving logical gaps in reasoning. Geographer Andrew Sluyter argued that Diamond was just as ignorant as the racists of the 19th century. Sluyter challenged Diamond's theory since it seemed to suggest that environmental conditions lead to gene selection, which then lead to wealth and power for certain civilizations. Sluyter also attacks environmental determinism by condemning it as a highly studied and popular field based entirely on Diamond's \\"quick and dirty\\" combination of natural and social sciences. * Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson similarly criticized Diamond's work in their book Why Nations Fail. They contend that the theory is outdated and can not effectively explain differences in economic growth after 1500 or the reasons why states that are geographically close can exhibit vast differences in wealth. They instead favored an institutional approach in which a society's success or failure is based on the underlying strength of its institutions. =Geography and pre-colonial African state-building =  The effects of climate and land abundance on the development of state systems  In his book States and Power in Africa, political scientist Jeffrey Herbst argues that environmental conditions help explain why, in contrast to other parts of the world such as Europe, many pre-colonial societies in Africa did not develop into dense, settled, hierarchical societies with strong state control that competed with neighboring states for people and territory. Herbst argues that the European state-building experience was highly idiosyncratic because it occurred under systemic geographic pressures that favored wars of conquest ‚Äì namely, passable terrain, land scarcity, and high-population densities. Faced with the constant threat of war, political elites sent administrators and armed forces from the urban centers into rural hinterlands to raise taxes, recruit soldiers, and fortify buffer zones. European states consequently developed strong institutions and capital-periphery linkages. By contrast, geographic and climatic factors in pre-colonial Africa made establishing absolute control over particular pieces of land prohibitively costly. For example, because African farmers relied on rain-fed agriculture and consequently invested little in particular pieces of land, they could easily flee rulers rather than fight. Some early African empires, like the Ashanti Empire, successfully projected power over large distances by building roads. The largest pre-colonial polities arose in the Sudanian Savanna belt of West Africa because the horses and camels could transport armies over the terrain. In other areas, no centralized political organizations existed above the village level. African states did not develop more responsive institutions under colonial rule or post-independence. Colonial powers had little incentive to develop state institutions to protect their colonies against invasion, having divided up Africa at the Berlin Conference. The colonizers instead focused on exploiting natural resources and exploitation colonialism.  The effect of disease environments  Dr. Marcella Alsan argues the prevalence of the tsetse fly hampered early state formation in Africa. Because the tsetse virus was lethal to cows and horses, communities afflicted by the insect could not rely on the agricultural benefits provided by livestock. African communities were prevented from stockpiling agricultural surplus, working the land, or eating meat. Because the disease environment hindered the formation of farming communities, early African societies resembled small hunter- gatherer groups and not centralized states. The relative availability of livestock animals enabled European societies to form centralized institutions, develop advanced technologies, and create an agricultural network. They could rely on their livestock to reduce the need for manual labor. Livestock also diminished the comparative advantage of owning slaves. African societies relied on the use of rival tribesman as slave labor where the fly was prevalent, which impeded long-term societal cooperation. Alsan argues that her findings support the view of Kenneth Sokoloff and Stanley Engerman that factor endowments shape state institutions. =Llamas, chu√±o and the Inca Empire= Carl Troll has argued that the development of the Inca state in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allow for the elaboration of the staple food chu√±o. Chu√±o, which can be stored for long times, is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern Peruvian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and dried potato is that other crops such as maize can also be preserved with only sun. Troll also argued that llamas, the Incas' pack animal, can be found in their largest numbers in this very same region. It is worth considering that the maximum extent of the Inca Empire coincided with the greatest distribution of alpacas and llamas. As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building. While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire, he opposed environmental determinism, arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization. Effects of geography on political regimes  Numerous scholars have argued that geographic and environmental factors affect the types of political regime that societies develop, and shape paths towards democracy versus dictatorship. = The disease environment = Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson have achieved notoriety for demonstrating that diseases and terrain have helped shape tendencies towards democracy versus dictatorship, and through these economic growth and development. In their book Why Nations Fail, as well as a paper titled The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors show that the colonial disease environment shaped the tendency for Europeans to settle the territory or not, and whether they developed systems of agriculture and labor markets that were free and egalitarian versus exploitative and unequal. These choices of political and economic institutions, they argue, shaped tendencies to democracy or dictatorship over the following centuries. =Factor endowments= In order to understand the impact and creation of institutions during early state formation, economic historians Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff examined the economic development of the Americas during colonization. They found that the beginnings of the success or failure of American colonies were based on the specific factor endowments available to each colony. These endowments included the climate, soil profitability, crop potential, and even native population density. Institutions formed to take advantage of these factor endowments. Those that were most successful developed an ability to change and adapt to new circumstances over time. For example, the development of economic institutions, such as plantations, was caused by the need for a large property and labor force to harvest sugar and tobacco, while smallholder farms thrived in areas where scale economies were absent. Though initially profitable, plantation colonies also suffered from large dependent populations over time as slaves and natives were given few rights, limiting the population available to drive future economic progress and technological development. Factor endowments also influenced political institutions. This is demonstrated by the plantation owning elite using their power to secure long lasting government institutions and pass legislation that lead to the persistence of inequality society. Engerman and Sokoloff found smallholder economies to be more equitable since they discouraged an elite class from forming, and distributed political power democratically to most land-owning males. These differences in political institutions were also highly influential in the development of schools, as more equitable societies demanded an educated population to make political decisions. Over time these institutional advantages had exponential effects, as colonies with educated and free populations were better suited to take advantage of technological change during the industrial revolution, granting country wide participation into the booming free-market economy. Engerman and Sokoloff conclude that while institutions heavily influenced the success of each colony, no individual type of institution is the source of economic and state growth. Other variables such as factor endowments, technologies, and the creation of property rights are just as crucial in societal development. To encourage state success an institution must be adaptable and suited to find the most economical source of growth. The authors also argue that while not the only means for success, institutional development has long lasting-economic and social effects on the state. Other prominent scholars contest the extent to which factor endowments determine economic and political institutions. American economists William Easterly and Ross Levine argue that economic development does not solely depend on geographic endowments‚Äîlike temperate climates, disease-resistant climates, or soil favorable to cash crops. They stress that there is no evidence that geographic endowments influence country incomes other than through institutions. They observe that states like Burundi are poor‚Äîdespite favorable environmental conditions like abundant rainfall and fertile soil‚Äîbecause of the damage wrought by colonialism. Other states like Canada with fewer endowments are more stable and have higher per capita incomes. Easterly and Levine further observe that studies of how the environment directly influences land and labor were tarred by racist theories of underdevelopment, but that does not mean that such theories can be automatically discredited. They argue that Diamond correctly stresses the importance of germs and crops in the very long-run of societal technological development. They find that regression results support the findings of Jared Diamond and David Landes that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine's findings most support the view that long- lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law. Jeffrey B. Nugent and James A. Robinson similarly challenge scholars like Barrington Moore who hold that certain factor endowments and agricultural preconditions necessarily lead to particular political and economic organizations. Nugent and Robinson show that coffee economies in South America pursued radically different paths of political and economic development during the nineteenth century. Some coffee states, like Costa Rica and Colombia, passed laws like the Homestead Act of 1862. They favored smallholders, held elections, maintained small militaries, and fought fewer wars. Smallholder arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like El Salvador and Guatemala produced coffee on plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a smallholder or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under colonialism‚Äînamely, legal statutes determining access to land, the background of the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition. Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone do not determine economic or political institutions. Direct effects of geography on economic development =Effects of terrain on trade and productivity= Historians have also noted population densities seem to concentrate on coastlines and that states with large coasts benefit from higher average incomes compared to those in landlocked countries. Coastal living has proven advantageous for centuries as civilizations relied on the coastline and waterways for trade, irrigation, and as a food source. Conversely, countries without coastlines or navigable waterways are often less urbanized and have less growth potential due to the slow movement of knowledge capital, technological advances, and people. They also have to rely on costly and time- consuming over-land trade, which usually results in lack of access to regional and international markets, further hindering growth. Additionally, interior locations tend to have both lower population densities and labor-productivity levels. However, factors including fertile soil, nearby rivers, and ecological systems suited for rice or wheat cultivation can give way to dense inland populations. Nathan Nunn and Diego Puga note that though rugged terrain usually makes farming difficult, prevents travel, and limits societal growth, early African states used harsh terrain to their advantage. The authors used a terrain ruggedness index to quantify topographic heterogeneity across several regions of Africa, while simultaneously controlling for variables such as diamond availability and soil fertility. The results suggest that historically, ruggedness is strongly correlated with decreased income levels across the globe and has negatively impacted state growth over time. They note that harsh terrain limited the flow of trade goods and decreased crop availability, while isolating communities from developing knowledge capital. However, the study also demonstrated that the terrain had positive effects on some African communities by protecting them from the slave trade. Communities that were located in areas with rugged features could successfully hide from slave traders and protect their homes from being destroyed. The study found that in these areas rugged topography produced long-term economic benefits and aided post-colonial state formation. =Effects of climate on productivity= The impact that climate and water navigability have on economic growth and GDP per capita was studied by notable scholars including Paul Krugman, Jared Diamond, and Jeffrey Sachs. By using variables to measure environmental determinism, such as climate, land composition, latitude, and the presence of infectious disease, they account for trends in worldwide economic development on local, regional and global scales. To do so, they measure economic growth with GDP per capita adjusted to purchasing power parity (PPP), while also taking into consideration population density and labor productivity.Gallup, John Luke, Jeffrey D. Sachs and Andrew D. Mellinger. \\"Geography and Economic Development.\\" International regional Science (1999 vol.22): 179‚Äì224. Print. Economic historians have found that societies in the Northern Hemisphere experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant transpiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones. Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital to invest in a sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of disease. =Climatic determinism and colonization= Climatic determinism, otherwise referred to as the equatorial paradox, is an aspect of economic geography. According to this theory, about 70% of a country's economic development can be predicted by the distance between that country and the equator, and that the further from the equator a country is located, the more developed it tends to be. The theory is the central argument of Philip M. Parker's Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth, in which he argues that since humans originated as tropical mammals, those who relocated to colder climates attempt to restore their physiological homeostasis through wealth-creation. This act includes producing more food, better housing, heating, warm clothes, etc. Conversely, humans that remained in warmer climates are more physiologically comfortable simply due to temperature, and so have less incentive to work to increase their comfort levels. Therefore, according to Parker GDP is a direct product of the natural compensation of humans to their climate. Political geographers have used climatic determinism ideology to attempt to predict and rationalize the history of civilization, as well as to explain existing or perceived social and cultural divides between peoples. Some argue that one of the first attempts geographers made to define the development of human geography across the globe was to relate a country's climate to human development. Using this ideology, many geographers believed they were able \\"to explain and predict the progress of human societies\\".Painter & Jeffrey, \\"Political Geography\\", Sage Publications, 2009, pg.177 This led to warmer climate zones being \\"seen as producing less civilized, more degenerate peoples, in need of salvation by western colonial powers.\\"Shirlow, Peter, Gallaher, Carolyn, Gilmartin, Mary, \\"Key Concepts in Political Geography\\", Sage Publications Ltd, 2009, pg.117. Ellsworth Huntington also travelled continental Europe in hopes of better understanding the connection between climate and state success, publishing his findings in The Pulse of Asia, and further elaborating in Civilization and Climate. Like the political geographers, a crucial component of his work was the belief that the climate of North-western Europe was ideal, with areas further north being too cold, and areas further south being too hot, resulting in lazy, laid-back populations. These ideas were powerful connections to colonialism, and may have played a role in the creation of the 'other' and the literature that many used to justify taking advantage of less advanced nations. Huntington also argued that climate can lead to the demise of even advanced civilizations through drought, food insecurity, and damages to economic production.

It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point,McLintock, A H, Ed. (1966) Cook Strait from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, updated 18-Sep-2007. Note: This is the distance between the North Island and Arapaoa Island; some sources give a slightly larger reading of around , that between the North Island and the South Island. and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.McLauchlan, Gordon (Ed.) (1987) New Zealand encyclopedia, Bateman, P. 121. . The strait is named after James Cook, the first European commander to sail through it, in 1770. p 99. In MƒÅori it has the name Raukawa or Te Moana- o-Raukawa (\\"The Sea of Raukawa\\"). Raukawa may mean \\"bitter leaves\\". History In MƒÅori legend, Cook Strait was discovered by Kupe the navigator. Kupe followed in his canoe a monstrous octopus called Te Wheke-a-Muturangi across Cook Strait and destroyed it in Tory Channel or at PƒÅtea. When Dutch explorer Abel Tasman first saw New Zealand in 1642, he thought Cook Strait was a bight closed to the east. He named it Zeehaen's Bight, after the Zeehaen, one of the two ships in his expedition. In 1769 James Cook established that it was a strait, which formed a navigable waterway. Cook Strait attracted European settlers in the early 19th century. Because of its use as a whale migration route, whalers established bases in the Marlborough Sounds and in the Kapiti area.McNab, Robert (1913) A History of Southern New Zealand from 1830 to 1840 Whitcombe and Tombs Limited. ASIN B000881KT4.Martin, Stephen (2001) The Whales' Journey: Chapter 4: The northerly migration Allen & Unwin. From the late 1820s until the mid-1960s Arapaoa Island was a base for whaling in the Sounds. Perano Head on the east coast of the island was the principal whaling station for the area. The houses built by the Perano family are now operated as tourist accommodation.Perano Homestead During the 1820s Te Rauparaha led a MƒÅori migration to, and the conquest and settlement of, the Cook Strait region. From 1840 more permanent settlements sprang up, first at Wellington, then at Nelson and at Whanganui (Petre). At this period the settlers saw Cook Strait in a broader sense than today's ferry-oriented New Zealanders: for them the strait stretched from Taranaki to Cape Campbell, so these early towns all clustered around \\"Cook Strait\\" (or \\"Cook's Strait\\", in the pre-Geographic Board usage of the times) as the central feature and central waterway of the new colony. Pelorus Jack Between 1888 and 1912 a Risso's dolphin named Pelorus Jack became famous for meeting and escorting ships around the Cook Strait. Pelorus Jack was usually spotted in Admiralty Bay between Cape Francis and Collinet Point, near French Pass, a channel used by ships travelling between Wellington and Nelson. Pelorus Jack is also remembered after he was the subject of a failed assassination attempt. He was later protected by a 1904 New Zealand law. At times when New Zealand feared invasion, various coastal fortifications were constructed to defend Cook Strait. During the Second World War, two gun installations were constructed on Wrights Hill behind Wellington. These gun could range across Cook Strait. In addition thirteen ( gun installations were constructed around Wellington, along the MƒÅkara coast, and at entrances to the Marlborough Sounds. The remains of most of these fortifications can still be seen. The Pencarrow Head Lighthouse was the first permanent lighthouse built in New Zealand. Its first keeper, Mary Jane Bennett, was the only female lighthouse keeper in New Zealand's history. The light was decommissioned in 1935 when it was replaced by the Baring Head Lighthouse. A number of ships have been wrecked with significant loss of life, such as the Maria in 1851,Disasters and Mishaps ‚Äì Shipwrecks, from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, originally published in 1966, updated 2007-09-18. the City of Dunedin in 1865,Steamer 'City of Dunedin'- Mysterious Sinking the St Vincent in 1869, the Lastingham in 1884, in 1909 and in 1968.  Geography  A view from the summit of Mount Kaukau across Cook Strait to the Marlborough Sounds in the distance. The strait runs in a general NW-SE direction, with the South Island on the west side and North Island on the east. At its narrowest point, separate Cape Terawhiti in the North Island from Perano Head on Arapaoa Island in the Marlborough Sounds. Perano Head is actually further north than Cape Terawhiti. In good weather one can see clearly across the strait. The west (South Island) coast runs along Cloudy Bay and past the islands and entrances to the Marlborough Sounds. The east (North Island) coast runs along Palliser Bay, crosses the entrance to Wellington harbour, past some Wellington suburbs and continues another to MƒÅkara Beach. The Brothers is a group of tiny islands in Cook Strait off the east coast of Arapaoa Island. North Brother island in this small chain is a sanctuary for the rare Brothers Island tuatara, while the largest of the islands is the site of the Brothers Island Lighthouse.

The beaches of Cloudy Bay, Clifford Bay, and Palliser Bay shoal gently down to , where there is a more or less extensive submarine plateau. The rest of the bottom topography is complex. To the east is the Cook Strait Canyon with steep walls descending eastwards into the bathyal depths of the Hikurangi Trench. To the north-west lies the Narrows Basin, where water is deep. Fisherman's Rock in the north end of the Narrows Basin rises to within a few metres of low tide, and is marked by waves breaking in rough weather. A relatively shallow submarine valley lies across the northern end of the Marlborough Sounds. The bottom topography is particularly irregular around the coast of the South Island where the presence of islands, underwater rocks, and the entrances to the sounds, create violent eddies. The strait has an average depth of . The South and North Islands were joined during the last ice age. Oceanography The waters of Cook Strait are dominated by strong tidal flows. The tidal flow through Cook Strait is unusual in that the tidal elevation at the ends of the strait are almost exactly out of phase with one another, so high water on one side meets low water on the other. Strong currents result, with almost zero tidal height change in the centre of the strait. Although the tidal surge should flow in one direction for six hours and then the reverse direction for six hours, a particular surge might last eight or ten hours with the reverse surge enfeebled. In especially boisterous weather conditions the reverse surge can be negated, and the flow can remain in the same direction through three surge periods and longer. This is indicated on marine charts for the region. Furthermore, the submarine ridges running off from the coast complicate the ocean flow and turbulence.Stevens, CL, M.J. Smith, B. Grant, C.L. Stewart,T. Divett, 2012, Tidal Stream Energy Extraction in a Large Deep Strait: the Karori Rip, Cook Strait, Continental Shelf Research, 33: 100‚Äì109. , DOI: 10.1016/j.csr.2011.11.012. There are numerous computer models of the tidal flow through Cook Strait. While the tidal components are readily realizable,Lunar tides in Cook Strait, New Zealand the residual flow is more difficult to model.Bowman, M.J., A.C. Kibblewhite, R. Murtagh, S.M. Chiswell and B.G. Sanderson (1983) Circulation and mixing in greater Cook Strait, New Zealand. Oceanologica Acta 6(4): 383‚Äì391 Tidal power In April 2008, Neptune Power was granted a resource consent to install a $10 million experimental underwater tidal stream turbine capable of producing one megawatt. The turbine was designed in Britain, and was to be built in New Zealand and placed in of water, due south of Sinclair Head, in waters known as the \\"Karori rip\\". The company claimed there is enough tidal movement in Cook Strait to generate 12 GW of power, more than one-and-a- half times New Zealand's current requirements.Renewable energy development: Tidal Energy: Cook Strait Harnessing the power of the sea Energy NZ, Vol 1, No 1, Winter 2007 Benign tides Energy NZ No.6, Spring 2008. Contrafed Publishing. Accessed 1 March 2009. In practice, only some of this energy could be harnessed.Radio New Zealand As of October 2016, this turbine had not been built and the Neptune Power website is a placeholder with no further announcements. On the other side of the strait, Energy Pacifica has applied for resource consent to install up to 10 marine turbines, each able to produce up to 1.2 MW, near the Cook Strait entrance to Tory Channel. The company claims that Tory Channel is an optimal site with a tidal current speed of and the best combination of bathymetry and accessibility to the electricity network. The power generated by tidal marine turbines varies as the cube of the tidal speed. Because the tidal speed doubles, eight times more tidal power is produced during spring tides than at neaps.  Cables  Electric power and communication cables link the North and South Islands across Cook Strait, operated by Transpower. Three submarine power cables cross Cook Strait between Oteranga Bay in the North Island and Fighting Bay in the South Island as part of the HVDC Inter-Island, which provides an electricity link between Benmore in the South island and Haywards in the North Island. Each cable operates at 350 kV, and can carry up to 500 MW, with Pole 2 of the link using one cable and Pole 3 using two cables. The link's total capacity is 1200 MW (500MW for Pole 2 and 700MW for Pole 3). The cables are laid on the seabed within a legally defined zone called the cable protection zone (CPZ). The CPZ is about wide for most of its length, narrowing where it nears the terminals on each shore. Fishing activities and anchoring boats are prohibited within the CPZ. Fibre optic cables carry telecommunications across Cook Strait, used by New Zealand's main telecommunication companies for domestic and commercial traffic and by Transpower for control of the HVDC link. Marine life Cook Strait is an important habitat for many cetacean species. Several dolphins (bottlenose, common, dusky) frequent the area along with killer whales and the endemic Hector's dolphins. Long-finned pilot whales often strand en masse at Golden Bay. The famous Pelorus Jack was a Risso's dolphin being observed escorting the ships between 1888 and 1912, though this species is not a common visitor to the New Zealand's waters. Large migratory whales attracted many whalers to the area in the winter. Currently, an annual survey of counting humpback whales is taken by Department of Conservation and former whalers help DOC to spot animals by using several vantage points along the strait such as on Stephens Island. Other occasional visitors include southern right whales, blue whales, sei whales and sperm whales. Giant squid specimens have been washed ashore around Cook Strait or found in the stomachs of sperm whales off Kaikoura. A colony of male fur seals has long been established near Red Rocks on the south Wellington coast.Cook Strait seal colonies Cook Strait offers good game fishing. Albacore tuna can be caught from January to May. Broadbill swordfish, bluenose, mako sharks and the occasional marlin and white shark can also be caught.The Marlborough Sounds Marlborough online. Retrieved 3 October 2008. Transport Cook Strait ferries in Wellington Harbour Regular ferry services run between Picton in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington, operated by KiwiRail (the Interislander) and Strait Shipping (Bluebridge). Both companies run services several times a day. Roughly half the crossing is in the strait, and the remainder within the Sounds. The journey covers and takes about three hours. The strait often experiences rough water and heavy swells from strong winds, especially from the south. New Zealand's position directly athwart the roaring forties means that the strait funnels westerly winds and deflects them into northerlies. As a result, ferry sailings are often disrupted and Cook Strait is regarded as one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. In 1968, the , a Wellington‚ÄìLyttelton ferry of the Union Company, foundered at the entrance to Wellington Harbour and capsized. Of the 610 passengers and 123 crew on board, 53 died.Initially the official toll was 51, but two names were added 22 and 40 years later respectively. In 2006, 14 metres waves resulted in the Interislander ferry DEV Aratere slewing violently and heeling to 50 degrees. Three passengers and a crew member were injured, five rail wagons were toppled and many trucks and cars were heavily damaged. Maritime NZ's expert witness Gordon Wood claimed that if the ferry had capsized most passengers and crew would have been trapped inside and would have had no warning or time to put on lifejackets.Cook Strait ferry Aratere 'nearly capsized' NZ Herald, 22 June 2006New rules for ferries after horror crossing Stuff, 31 January 2009. Air lines which operate or have operated flights across Cook Strait include Straits Air Freight Express, Air2there, CityJet and Sounds Air. Swimming According to oral tradition, the first woman to swim Cook Strait was Hine Poupou. She swam from Kapiti Island to d'Urville Island with the help of a dolphin.Polynesian History Other MƒÅori accounts tell of at least one swimmer who conquered the strait in 1831. In modern times, the strait was swum by Barrie Devenport in 1962. Lynne Cox was the first woman to swim it, in 1975. The most prolific swimmer of the strait is Philip Rush, who has crossed eight times, including two double crossings. Aditya Raut was the youngest swimmer at 11 years. Caitlin O'Reilly was the youngest female swimmer and youngest New Zealander at 12 years. Pam Dickson was the oldest swimmer at 55 years. John Coutts was the first person to swim the strait in both directions. By 2010, 74 single crossings had been made by 65 individuals, and three double crossings had been made by two individuals (Philip Rush and Meda McKenzie). In March 2016, Marilyn Korzekwa became the first Canadian and oldest woman, at 58 years old, to swim the strait. Crossing times are largely determined by the strong and sometimes unpredictable currents that operate in the strait.

KB (c. 1477 ‚Äì 12 March 1539), of Hever Castle in Kent, was an English diplomat and politician who was the father of Queen Anne Boleyn, from 1533 the second wife of King Henry VIII, and was thus the maternal grandfather of Queen Elizabeth I. By Henry VIII he was made a Knight of the Garter in 1523 and was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Rochford in 1525 and in 1529 was further enobled as Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond. Origins He was born in about 1477 at Blickling Hall in Norfolk, the son of Sir William Boleyn (1451‚Äì1505) of Blickling (purchased by Sir William's father Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, a wealthy mercer) by his wife Lady Margaret Butler (1454‚Äì1539), a daughter and co- heiress of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond. Marriage and issue At some time before 1499 he married Lady Elizabeth Howard, eldest daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk by his wife Elizabeth Tilney. Five children are attested, only three of whom survived childhood: * Thomas Boleyn the younger (c. 1500 ‚Äì ) died young; * Henry Boleyn (c. 1502/03 ‚Äì ) died young; *George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford (c.1504-1536), eldest surviving son and heir apparent who predeceased his father, having been executed in 1536 together with his sister the queen. From 1529 he used his father's junior title of Viscount Rochford as a courtesy title. * Mary Boleyn (c. 1499 ‚Äì 19 July 1543); Mary Carey (1520‚Äì1528); Mary Stafford (1534‚Äì1543); Mary's second husband, William Stafford, was knighted in 1545 ‚Äì two years after his wife's death in 1543. * Anne Boleyn (c. 1501/1507 ‚Äì 19 May 1536); later Marquess of Pembroke (1532‚Äì1536); later Queen Consort of England (1533‚Äì1536) Diplomatic career In 1503 Boleyn helped to escort Margaret Tudor north for her marriage to King James IV of Scotland. He was created a Knight of the Garter at the coronation of Henry VIII in 1509. His appointment as ambassador to the Low Countries brought him into contact with the regent Archduchess Margaret of Austria. Like Thomas, Margaret of Austria spoke French and Latin and they got along well enough for her to accept his daughter, Anne, as a maid of honour. Through his ability and the connections of his extended family, Thomas Boleyn became one of Henry VIII's leading diplomats. Known appointments and missions included: *1511 and 1517: Sheriff of Kent. *1512: One of a party of three envoys to the Netherlands. *1518‚Äì1521: ambassador to France, where he was involved in arrangements for the \\"Field of Cloth of Gold\\" meeting between Henry and the new French King Francis I in 1520. *1521 and 1523: Envoy to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. *1527: One of a large envoy to France. *1529: Envoy to a meeting of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Pope Clement VII, to seek support for the marriage annulment of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. This was followed by another envoy to France. Titles obtained Boleyn was invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1523.List of the Knights of the Garter (1348‚Äìpresent) Boleyn's claim to his other titles derived from his mother, Lady Margaret Butler who was the younger daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond. Thomas Butler, as an Irish peer, should only have sat in the Parliament of Ireland. However, as a personal friend of Henry VII he was summoned to the English parliament in November 1488 as \\"Thomas Ormond de Rochford, chevaler\\". At this time, he was already 8th Earl of Carrick and 7th Earl of Ormond. In English law, matrilineal descent is not considered valid for earldoms, and in Brehon law, then largely still in use in Ireland, new leaders were chosen by election. These customs were, in Boleyn's case, outweighed by a more important consideration ‚Äì he was the father of two daughters. Henry VIII had affairs first with Boleyn's elder daughter Mary, then with his younger daughter, Anne. Boleyn's ambition was so considerable that unsubstantiated rumours had it that he allowed his wife to have an affair with the king, but those rumours were intended to steer the king away from marrying Anne, and even suggested that she was his own daughter. When it was claimed that Henry had had an affair with both Anne's sister and mother, the king replied to the rumours, \\"Never with the mother.\\" In 1525, Henry VIII became enamoured of Anne and began pursuing her. Her father was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Rochford on 18 June 1525. The title referred to the \\"barony\\" of Rochford supposedly created in 1488 for his grandfather. The title had fallen into abeyance as Ormond had died without any male heir in 1515. Boleyn is often thought of as a power hungry, ambitious and scheming man who sacrificed his daughters for personal gain, but his biographer, Dr Lauren Mackay, has successfully argued that he enjoyed a highly successful career as an ambassador and courtier years before his daughters caught the King's eye. As Henry's passion for Anne intensified, so did her father's titles, though these rewards were not solely due to Anne but also Boleyn's own merit. Henry pressured the main claimant to the earldom of Ormond, Piers Butler, to renounce all his claims to the titles in 1529. Piers Butler was rewarded by being created Earl of Ossory five days later. Boleyn's claims to the Earldom of Wiltshire also depended upon his Irish relatives. This time, he had to go back to his maternal great-grandfather, James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, to establish a claim. While James Butler was indeed the 1st Earl of Wiltshire (of the third creation), on 1 May 1461 he lost his titles and his life when he was executed by the victorious Yorkists. The title was subsequently revived (in fourth and fifth creations) and bestowed on people unrelated to the Butlers of Ormond. This did not prevent the creation of the earldom for the 6th time. On 8 December 1529 Thomas Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, was created Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond. Also on 8 December 1529, the Earl of Wiltshire's only surviving son, George, was granted the courtesy title of Viscount Rochford. His title of Viscount, although initially a courtesy title, ceased to be a mere courtesy title sometime before 13 July 1530. On 17 May 1536, Lord Rochford was executed for treason, and all his titles were forfeited. His widow, Jane, Viscountess Rochford, however, continued to use the title after her husband's death. Lady Rochford was herself attainted for treason and beheaded at Tower Green (not Tower Hill) within the Tower of London on 13 February 1542 with Henry VIII's fifth wife, Queen Katherine Howard. Boleyn was appointed Lord Privy Seal in 1530. In 1532, his daughter Anne was granted a peerage, being created Marquess of Pembroke in her own right, before marrying Henry the following year and becoming queen consort. Boleyn acquiesced in Anne's judicial execution and that of her brother Lord Rochford when Henry discarded her in favour of his third wife, Queen Jane Seymour. At this point Boleyn was replaced as Lord Privy Seal and left in disgrace until his death a few years later. He suffered a final indignity when the claims of Piers Butler to the Earldom of Ormond were recognized and he again became Earl of Ormond from 22 January 1538. There were two earls of Ormond in the Kingdom until his death on 12 March 1539. Death and burial He died at Hever Castle on 12 March 1539 and was buried in St. Peter's Church, Hever, where survives his elaborate monumental brass. He is depicted dressed in full robes wearing the insignia of a Knight of the Garter, with the Badge on his left breast and the Garter around his left knee. His head rests on a helm surmounted by a crest of a falcon displayed (his daughter's heraldic badge) and his feet rest on a griffin.https://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/12-march-1539-death-thomas-boleyn- earl-wiltshire-father-anne-boleyn/ The inscription reads: Here lieth Sir Thomas Bullen, Knight of the Order of the Garter, Erle of Wilscher and Erle or Ormunde, which decessed the 12th dai of Marche in the iere of our Lorde 1538.1538 old style date, 1539 in modern style In popular culture Thomas Boleyn has been portrayed by Sir Michael Hordern in Anne of the Thousand Days (1969), by Benjamin Whitrow in Henry VIII, and by Jack Shepherd and Mark Rylance in the 2003 and 2008 film versions of The Other Boleyn Girl, respectively.

Work for hire is a statutorily defined term (17 U.S.C. ¬ß 101), so a work for hire is not created merely because parties to an agreement state that the work is a work for hire. It is an exception to the general rule that the person who actually creates a work is the legally recognized author of that work. According to copyright law in the United States and certain other copyright jurisdictions, if a work is \\"made for hire\\", the employernot the employeeis considered the legal author. In some countries, this is known as corporate authorship. The entity serving as an employer may be a corporation or other legal entity, an organization, or an individual. Author accreditation in the US  Accreditation has no impact on work for hire in the US. The actual creator may or may not be publicly credited for the work, and this credit does not affect its legal status. States that are party to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works recognize separately copyrights and moral rights, with moral rights including the right of the actual creators to publicly identify themselves as such, and to maintain the integrity of their work. For example, Microsoft hired many programmers to develop the Windows operating system, which is credited simply to Microsoft Corporation. By contrast, Adobe Systems lists many of the developers of Photoshop in its credits. In both cases, the software is the property of the employing company. In both cases, the actual creators have moral rights. Similarly, newspapers routinely credit news articles written by their staff, and publishers credit the writers and illustrators who produce comic books featuring characters such as Batman or Spider-Man, but the publishers hold copyrights to the work. However, articles published in academic journals, or work produced by freelancers for magazines, are not generally works created as a work for hire, which is why it is common for the publisher to require the copyright owner, the author, to sign a copyright transfer, a short legal document transferring specific author copyrights to the publisher. In this case the authors retain those copyrights in their work not granted to the publisher. Law in the United States The circumstances in which a work is considered a \\"work made for hire\\" is determined by the United States Copyright Act of 1976 as either The first situation applies only when the work's creator is an employee, not an independent contractor.US Copyright Office, Circular 9: Work-Made-For-Hire Under the 1976 Copyright Act. The determination of whether an individual is an employee for the purposes of the work made for hire doctrine is determined under the common law of agency, in which a court looks to a multitude of factors to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists. In the Supreme Court case affirming that the common law of agency should be used to distinguish employees from independent contractors in the work for hire context, Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid,Cmty. for Creative Non- Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 (1989) the Court listed some of these factors: > In determining whether a hired party is an employee under the general common > law of agency, we consider the hiring party's right to control the manner > and means by which the product is accomplished. Among the other factors > relevant to this inquiry are the skill required; the source of the > instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the duration of the > relationship between the parties; whether the hiring party has the right to > assign additional projects to the hired party; the extent of the hired > party's discretion over when and how long to work; the method of payment; > the hired party's role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the hiring > party is in business; the provision of employee benefits; and the tax > treatment of the hired party. See Restatement ¬ß 220(2) (setting forth a non- > exhaustive list of factors relevant to determining whether a hired party is > an employee).\\" On the other hand, if the work is created by an independent contractor or freelancer, the work may be considered a work for hire only if all of the following conditions are met: * the work must come within one of the nine limited categories of works listed in the definition above, namely (1) a contribution to a collective work, (2) a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, (3) a translation, (4) a supplementary work, (5) a compilation, (6) an instructional text, (7) a test, (8) answer material for a test, (9) an atlas; * the work must be specially ordered or commissioned; * there must be a written agreement between the parties specifying that the work is a work made for hire by use of the phrase \\"work for hire\\" or \\"work made for hire.\\" In other words, mutual agreement that a work is a work for hire is not enough. Any agreement not meeting all of the above criteria is not a valid work for hire agreement and all rights to the work will remain with the creator. Further, courts have held that the agreement must be negotiated, though not signed, before the work begins. Retroactive work for hire is not permitted.Schiller & Schmidt Inc. v. Nordisco Corp., 969 F2d 410 (1992) When relying on agreements in which creators transfer rights to a hiring party (Copyright transfer agreement), a hiring party often finds that it has only limited scope to alter, update, or transform the work. For example, a motion picture may hire dozens of creators of copyrightable works (e.g., music scores, scripts, sets, sound effects, costumes) any one of which would require repeated agreements with the creators if conditions for showing the film or creating derivatives of it changed. Failing to reach agreement with any one creator could prevent the showing of the film entirely. To avoid this scenario, producers of motion pictures and similar works require that all contributions by non-employees be works made for hire. On the other hand, a work for hire agreement is less desirable for creators than a Copyright transfer agreement. Under work for hire, the commissioning party owns all rights from the very start even if the contract is breached, whereas under a transfer of rights, the creator can hold back the rights until all terms of the contract are fulfilled. Holding back the rights can be a forceful tool when it is necessary to compel a commissioning party to fulfill its obligations. An author has the inalienable right to terminate a copyright transfer 35 years after agreeing to permanently relinquish the copyright. However, according to the US Copyright Office, Circular 9 \\"the termination provisions of the law do not apply to works made for hire.\\" These restrictions, in both the work for hire doctrine and the right of termination, exist out of recognition that artists frequently face unequal bargaining power in their business dealings. Nonetheless, failure to secure a work-for-hire agreement by commissioning organizations can create difficult situations. One such example is the artist Raymond Kaskey's 1985 statue Portlandia, an iconic symbol of the city of Portland, Oregon. Unlike most works of public art, Kaskey has put strong prohibitions on the use of images of the statue, located atop the main entrance to the famous Portland Building. He sued Paramount Pictures for including shots of the statue in the Madonna motion picture Body of Evidence. As a result, it is nearly impossible to film portions of one of downtown Portland's most vibrant neighborhoods, and the city has lost out on the potential to create merchandise and souvenirs from one of its most iconic landmarks. An author can grant his or her copyright (if any) to the hiring party. However, if not a work made for hire, the author or the author's heirs may exercise their right to terminate the grant. Termination of a grant cannot be effective until 35 years after the execution of the grant or, if the grant covers the right of publication, no earlier than 40 years after the execution of the grant or 35 years after publication under the grant (whichever comes first). The application of the law to materials such as lectures, textbooks, and academic articles produced by teachers is somewhat unclear. The near- universal practice in education has traditionally been to act on the assumption that they were not work for hire. Where start-up technology companies are concerned, some courts have considered that the traditional factors for finding that an author is an \\"employee\\" can be less important than in more-established companies, for example if the employee works remotely and is not directly supervised, or if the employee is paid entirely in equity without benefits or tax withholding. =Work for hire amendment= In 1999, a work for hire related amendment was inserted into the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999. It specified that sound recordings from musical artists could be categorized as works for hire from the recording studios. =Employer‚Äìemployee relationship under agency law= If a work is created by an employee, part 1 of the copyright code‚Äôs definition of a work made for hire applies. To help determine who is an employee, the Supreme Court in CCNV v. Reid identified certain factors that characterize an \\"employer-employee\\" relationship as defined by agency law: # Control by the employer over the work (e.g., the employer may determine how the work is done, has the work done at the employer's location, and provides equipment or other means to create work) # Control by employer over the employee (e.g., the employer controls the employee's schedule in creating work, has the right to have the employee perform other assignments, determines the method of payment, and/or has the right to hire the employee's assistants) # Status and conduct of employer (e.g., the employer is in business to produce such works, provides the employee with benefits, and/or withholds tax from the employee‚Äôs payment) Copyright duration =United States= In the United States a \\"work for hire\\" (published after 1978) receives copyright protection until 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever comes first. This differs from the standard U.S. copyright term, life of the author plus 70 years, because the \\"author\\" of a work for hire is often not an actual person, in which case the standard term would be unlimited, which is unconstitutional.Peter B. Hirtle, Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States, 1 January 2007. Works published prior to 1978 have no differentiation in copyright term between works made for hire and works with recognized individual creators. =European Union= In the European Union, even if a Member State provides for the possibility of a legal person to be the original rightholder (such as is possible in the UK),Section 11, UK Copyrights, Designs and Patents Act 1988 as amended to 2005.

If the natural author or authors are not identified, nor become known subsequently, then the copyright term is the same as that for an anonymous or pseudonymous work, i.e. 70 years from publication for a literary or artistic work; or, if the work has not been published in that time, 70 years from creation.Article 1, Directive harmonizing the term of copyright protection, Directive 93/98/EC. (Copyright durations for works created before 1993 may be subject to transitional arrangements).In the UK see for example Copyright law of the United Kingdom, and links from that page. An exception is for scientific or critical editions of works in the public domain. Per article 70 of the German copyright law, editions as the result of scholarly or scientific analysis have a copyright length of 25 years.

Time controls are typically enforced by means of a game clock, where the times below are given per player. Time pressure (or time trouble or Zeitnot) is the situation of having very little time on a player's clock to complete their remaining moves. Classification The amount of time given to each player to complete their moves will vary from game to game. However, most games tend to change the classification of tournaments according to the length of time given to the players. In chess, the categories of short time limits are: \\"bullet\\", \\"blitz\\", and \\"rapid\\". \\"Bullet\\" games are the fastest, with either a very short time limit per move (such as ten seconds) or a very short total time (such as one or two minutes). \\"Blitz\\" games typically give five to ten minutes per player, and \\"rapid\\" games give between ten and sixty minutes. By way of contrast, for Go, anything under twenty minutes could be considered \\"blitz\\". Methodology The exact approach to using a game clock to regulate games varies considerably. =Sudden death= This is the simplest methodology. Each player is assigned a fixed amount of time for the whole game. If a player's main time expires, they generally lose the game. =Overtime formats= Here the game time is separated into two basic domains: the main time and the overtime. To switch between the two requires some trigger event, often the expiration of the main time. In chess, reaching a fixed number of moves can trigger the gain of a fixed amount of extra time. This usually occurs in long games after the 40th move: e.g. 120 minutes to complete the first 40 moves, and another 30 minutes to complete the rest of the game. In go two common forms are: Byo- yomi This timing method is also used in shogi. The word is borrowed from Japanese; the term literally means \\"counting the seconds\\", or more generally, \\"countdown\\". After the main time is depleted, a player has a certain number of periods (for example five periods, each of thirty seconds). If a move is completed before the time expires, the time period resets and restarts the next turn. If a move is not completed within a time period, the time period will expire, and the next time period begins. This is written as \\\\+ of . Using up the last period means that the player has lost on time. In some systems, such as certain Go title matches, there is no main time; instead, the time used is rounded up to the nearest whole increment, such as one minute, and the actual counting of time occurs toward the end of one player's time. A typical time control is \\"60 minutes + 30 seconds byo-yomi\\", which means that each player may make as many or as few moves as he chooses during his first 60 minutes of thinking time, but after the hour is exhausted, he must make each move in thirty seconds or less. To enforce byo-yomi, a third person or a game clock with a byo-yomi option is necessary. In professional Go games and many amateur tournaments, a player has several byo-yomi periods, for example five periods of one minute each. If a player makes his move within a one-minute period, he retains all five periods for his future moves. If a player oversteps one minute, he starts the following move in the second rather than the first byo-yomi period. In effect, the player has one minute per move plus four extra one-minute packets which may be used as needed, e.g. four moves of two minutes each, or one move of five minutes, or any other combination. In higher-level tournaments, such as the Kisei tournament, the player's time is often composed entirely of byo-yomi periods (for example, in an eight-hour game, the player may have 480 periods of one minute each), rather than having a main block of thinking time. In this case, the actual counting of time (verbally) begins once the player falls below a certain threshold of time, such as 10 minutes; when the time is being counted, the player is informed at intervals how much time they have used in their current period, and how many extra periods they have left. (For example, the time may be called at 10-second intervals, and when 55 and 58 seconds have been used; during a player's final minute, the last 10 seconds are counted one by one.) Similarly, in the televised NHK Cup tournament, the player has 30 seconds per move plus 10 extra one-minute periods which may be used as needed. When analog game clocks are used to enforce byo-yomi, it is more convenient to assign additional time for a block of moves, rather than for each move. In Canadian byo-yomi, a player typically gets 5 minutes for 10 to 20 moves. The IGS Go server uses a similar system, but the byo-yomi time is variable and always covers 25 moves. Thus the time control \\"20 minutes + 15 minutes byoyomi\\" on IGS means that after the initial 20 minutes of thinking time are over, a player is granted 15 additional minutes, which may be spent however he chooses. If these minutes expire before he has made 25 more moves, he loses. If he makes 25 more moves in less than 15 minutes, he is granted another 15 minutes of byo-yomi, and so on indefinitely. Canadian byo-yomi imposes a certain average speed of play, but allows the player to spend more time to ponder on difficult moves. Several byo-yomi periods in one move per period variant (also known as Japanese byo-yomi, though that is a bit of tautology) serve essentially the same purpose, albeit to a lesser extent. Unused time during one byo-yomi period does not carry forward to future moves. This is in contrast to the Fischer clock often used in chess, with designations such as \\"5 minutes + 12 seconds per move\\". Under this time control each player has twelve seconds added to his clock after every move, starting from the first move, regardless of how much time he spends on each move. Thus if a player thinks for eight seconds before making his first move, he will have five minutes and four seconds on his clock after making it. Canadian overtime After using all of their main time, a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time  for example, twenty moves within five minutes. In Go, players stop the clock, and the player in overtime counts out the required number of stones and sets the remaining stones out of reach so as not to become confused, whilst the opponent sets the clock to the overtime period. If all the moves are made in time, then another period of overtime starts  another set of stones and the timer again reset to the overtime period. If all the moves are not made in time, the player has lost on time. This is written as \\\\+ in <time period>. The Origins of Canadian Byo- Yomi In Progressive Canadian Overtime the required rate of play alters in additional overtime periods  EG 1hour + 10 in 5, 20 in 5, 30 in 5, 40 in 5 etc. BGA Rules page =Increment and delay methods= These are the timing methods most often used in chess. In increment (also known as bonus and Fischer, after Bobby Fischer's patent on it), a specified amount of time is added to the player's main time after each move, unless the player's main time ran out before they completed their move. For example, if the time control is \\"G/90;inc30\\" (90 minutes of main time per player, with a 30-second increment each move), each player gets an additional 30 seconds added to their main time after each move, unless the player's main time ran out first. Under FIDE and US Chess rules, each player gets the increment for the first move as well. For example, with \\"G/3;inc2\\", each player starts with three minutes and two seconds on the first move. Not all digital chess clocks automatically give the increment for the first move; for those that don't, the increment time has to be added manually. In simple delay (also known as US delay), the clock waits for a fixed delay period during each move before the player's main time starts counting down. For example, if the delay is ten seconds, the clock waits for ten seconds each move before the main time starts counting down. Bronstein delay (named after David Bronstein, its inventor), like increment, adds a fixed amount of time after each move, but no more than the amount of time spent to make the move. For example, if the delay is ten seconds and a player uses ten or more seconds for a move, ten seconds are added after they complete their move. If the player uses five seconds, only those five seconds are returned to the clock. This ensures that the main time left on the clock can never increase even if a player makes fast moves. As with increment, under FIDE and US Chess rules, the delay time is applied to the first move. Simple and Bronstein delay are mathematically equivalent. The advantage of Bronstein delay is that the player can easily see how much time is remaining without mentally adding the delay to the main clock. The advantage of simple delay is that the player can always tell whether the delay time or the main time is counting down. Simple delay is the form of delay most often used in the United States, while Bronstein delay is more often used in most other countries. =Penalty formats= Such methods exact a points penalty, or fine, on the player who breaches their time limit. One example occurs in Go, where the Ing Rules enforce fines on breaches of main time and overtime periods. \\"Ing's SST Laws of Go\\" In tournament Scrabble, the time control is standardized to 25 minutes per side with a 10-point penalty for each minute or part thereof that is used in excess,http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/build/rules/rules2.html#r3c2 \\"NSA Official Tournament Rules\\", National Scrabble Association so that overstepping the allotted time by 61 seconds carries a 20-point penalty. =Hourglass= Each player's clock starts with a specified time (such as one minute or ten minutes). While one player is deciding a move, their clock time decreases and their opponent's clock time increases. This is analogous to an hourglass: sand empties from one container and fills the other. The sum of both clocks always remains the same, and slow moves give extra time to the opponent. There is no maximum amount of time allotted for a game with this timing method; if both players play quickly enough, the game will continue until its natural end. Use of this time control is uncommon.

He was born at Allington Castle near Maidstone in Kent, though the family was originally from Yorkshire. His family adopted the Lancastrian side in the Wars of Roses. His mother was Anne Skinner, and his father Henry had been a Privy Councillor of Henry VII and remained a trusted adviser when Henry VIII ascended the throne in 1509. Thomas followed his father to court after his education at St John's College, Cambridge. Entering the King's service, he was entrusted with many important diplomatic missions. In public life his principal patron was Thomas Cromwell, after whose death he was recalled from abroad and imprisoned (1541). Though subsequently acquitted and released, shortly thereafter he died. His poems were circulated at court and may have been published anonymously in the anthology The Court of Venus (earliest edition c.1537) during his lifetime, but were not published under his name until after his death; the first major book to feature and attribute his verse was Tottel's Miscellany (1557), printed 15 years after his death. Early life Thomas Wyatt was born at Allington, Kent in 1503, the son of Sir Henry Wyatt by Anne Skinner, the daughter of John Skinner of Reigate, Surrey.; . He had a brother Henry, assumed to have died an infant,. and a sister Margaret who married Sir Anthony Lee (died 1549) and was the mother of Queen Elizabeth's champion Sir Henry Lee.. =Education and diplomatic career= Wyatt was over six feet tall, reportedly both handsome and physically strong. He was an ambassador in the service of Henry VIII, but he entered Henry's service in 1515 as \\"Sewer Extraordinary\\", and the same year he began studying at St John's College, Cambridge. He accompanied Sir John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford to Rome to help petition Pope Clement VII to annul Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, freeing him to marry Anne Boleyn. According to some, Wyatt was captured by the armies of Emperor Charles V when they captured Rome and imprisoned the Pope in 1527, but he managed to escape and make it back to England. He was knighted in 1535 and appointed High Sheriff of Kent for 1536. He was elected knight of the shire (MP) for Kent in December 1541. =Marriage and issue= In 1520, Wyatt married Elizabeth Brooke (1503‚Äì1560).. A year later, they had son Thomas (1521‚Äì1554) who led Wyatt's rebellion many years after his father's death. In 1524, Henry VIII assigned Wyatt to be an ambassador at home and abroad, and he separated from his wife soon after on grounds of adultery.  Wyatt's poetry and influence  Wyatt's professed object was to experiment with the English language, to civilise it, to raise its powers to equal those of other European languages. A significant amount of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by Italian poet Petrarch; he also wrote sonnets of his own. He took subject matter from Petrarch's sonnets, but his rhyme schemes are significantly different. Petrarch's sonnets consist of an \\"octave\\" rhyming abba abba, followed by a \\"sestet\\" with various rhyme schemes. Wyatt employs the Petrarchan octave, but his most common sestet scheme is cddc ee. This marks the beginning of an English contribution to sonnet structure of three quatrains and a closing couplet.The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, pg. 647 Wyatt experimented in stanza forms including the rondeau, epigrams, terza rima, ottava rima songs, and satires, as well as with monorime, triplets with refrains, quatrains with different length of line and rhyme schemes, quatrains with codas, and the French forms of douzaine and treizaine. He introduced the poulter's measure form, rhyming couplets composed of a 12-syllable iambic line (Alexandrine) followed by a 14-syllable iambic line (fourteener), and he is considered a master of the iambic tetrameter. Wyatt's poetry reflects classical and Italian models, but he also admired the work of Geoffrey Chaucer, and his vocabulary reflects that of Chaucer; for example, he uses Chaucer's word newfangleness, meaning fickle, in They flee from me that sometime did me seek. Many of his poems deal with the trials of romantic love, and the devotion of the suitor to an unavailable or cruel mistress. Other poems are scathing, satirical indictments of the hypocrisies and pandering required of courtiers who are ambitious to advance at the Tudor court. Wyatt's poems are short but fairly numerous. His 96 love poems appeared posthumously (1557) in a compendium called Tottel's Misceallany. The most noteworthy are thirty-one sonnets the first in English. Ten of them were translations from Petrarch, while all were written in the Petrarchan form, apart from the couplet ending which Wyatt introduced. serious and reflective in tone, the sonnet shows some stiffness of construction and the metrical uncertainty indicative of difficulty Wyatt found in the new form. Yet their conciseness represents a great advance on the prolixity and uncouthness of much earlier poetry. Wyatt was also responsible for the most important introduction of the personal note into English. Poetry, for, though following his models closely, he wrote of his own experiences. His epigrams, songs and rondeaux are lighter than the sonnets, and they also reveal the care and the elegance that were typical of the new romanticism. His satires are composed in the Italian terza rima, once again showing the direction of the innovating tendencies. = Attribution = The Egerton ManuscriptEgerton Manuscript 2711, British Museum is an album containing Wyatt's personal selection of his poems and translations which preserves 123 texts, partly in his handwriting. Tottel's Miscellany (1557) is the Elizabethan anthology which created Wyatt's posthumous reputation; it ascribes 96 poems to him, 33 not in the Egerton Manuscript. These 156 poems can be ascribed to Wyatt with certainty on the basis of objective evidence. Another 129 poems have been ascribed to him purely on the basis of subjective editorial judgment. They are mostly derived from the Devonshire Manuscript CollectionThe Devonshire Maunscript Collection of Early Tudor poetry 1532‚Äì41, British Museum and the Blage manuscript.Blage MS, Trinity College, Dublin Rebholz comments in his preface to Sir Thomas Wyatt, The Complete Poems, \\"The problem of determining which poems Wyatt wrote is as yet unsolved\\". However, this statement is predicated on his preface's perfunctory rejection of the most significant contribution to its resolution, Richard Harrier's The Canon of Sir Thomas Wyatt's Poetry, which presents an analysis of the documentary evidence establishing a solid case for rejecting 101 of the 129 texts ascribed to Wyatt on no objective basis whatsoever. = Assessment = Critical opinions have varied widely regarding Wyatt's work. Eighteenth century critic Thomas Warton considered Wyatt \\"confessedly an inferior\\" to his contemporary Henry Howard, and felt that Wyatt's \\"genius was of the moral and didactic species\\" but deemed him \\"the first polished English satirist\\". The 20th century saw an awakening in his popularity and a surge in critical attention. His poems were found praisworthy by numerous poets, including Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, Yvor Winters, Basil Bunting, Louis Zukofsky and George Oppen. C. S. Lewis called him \\"the father of the Drab Age\\" (i.e. the unornate), from what he calls the \\"golden\\" age of the 16th century. Patricia Thomson describes Wyatt as \\"the Father of English Poetry\\".  Rumoured affair with Anne Boleyn  Anne Boleyn Many have conjectured that Wyatt fell in love with Anne Boleyn in the early- to mid-1520s. Their acquaintance is certain, but it is not certain whether the two shared a romantic relationship. George Gilfillan implies that Wyatt and Boleyn were romantically involved. In his verse, Wyatt calls his mistress Anna and might allude to events in her life: > And now I follow the coals that be quent, From Dover to Calais against my > mind '' Gilfillan argues that these lines could refer to Anne's trip to France in 1532 prior to her marriage to Henry VIII and could imply that Wyatt was present, although his name is not included among those who accompanied the royal party to France. Wyatt's sonnet \\"Whoso List To Hunt\\" may also allude to Anne's relationship with the King: > Graven in diamonds with letters plain, There is written her fair neck round > about, \\"Noli me tangere [Do not touch me], Caesar's, I am\\". '' In still plainer terms, Wyatt's late sonnet \\"If waker care\\" describes his first \\"love\\" for \\"Brunette that set our country in a roar\\"  clearly Boleyn.  Imprisonment on charges of adultery  In May 1536, Wyatt was imprisoned in the Tower of London for allegedly committing adultery with Anne Boleyn. He was released later that year thanks to his friendship or his father's friendship with Thomas Cromwell, and he returned to his duties. During his stay in the Tower, he may have witnessed Anne Boleyn's execution (19 May 1536) from his cell window, as well as the executions of the five men with whom she was accused of adultery; he wrote a poem which might have been inspired by that experience. Around 1537, Elizabeth Darrell was his mistress, a former maid of honour to Catherine of Aragon. She bore Wyatt three sons. Memorial in Sherborne Abbey By 1540, he was again in the king's favour, as he was granted the site and many of the manorial estates of the dissolved Boxley Abbey. However, he was charged again with treason in 1541; the charges were again lifted, but only thanks to the intervention of Queen Catherine Howard and on the condition of reconciling with his wife. He was granted a full pardon and restored once again to his duties as ambassador. After the execution of Catherine Howard, there were rumours that Wyatt's wife Elizabeth was a possibility to become Henry VIII's next wife, despite the fact that she was still married to Wyatt. He became ill not long after and died on 11 October 1542 around age 39. He is buried in Sherborne Abbey.  Descendants and relatives  Long after Wyatt's death, his only legitimate son Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger led a thwarted rebellion against Henry's daughter Mary I, for which he was executed. The rebellion's aim was to set the Protestant- minded Elizabeth on the throne, the daughter of Anne Boleyn. His sister Margaret Wyatt was the mother of Henry Lee of Ditchley, from whom descended the Lee family of Virginia, including Robert E. Lee. Wyatt was an ancestor of Wallis Simpson, wife of King Edward VIII, later Duke of Windsor.Vickers, Hugo (2011). Behind Closed Doors: The Tragic, Untold, Story of the Duchess of Windsor.

He is known for his expressive colourisations, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent marine paintings. He left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 works on paper. He was championed by the leading English art critic John Ruskin from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting. Turner was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London, to a modest lower-middle-class family. He lived in London all his life, retaining his Cockney accent and assiduously avoiding the trappings of success and fame. A child prodigy, Turner studied at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1789, enrolling when he was 14, and exhibited his first work there at 15. During this period, he also served as an architectural draftsman. He earned a steady income from commissions and sales, which due to his troubled, contrary nature, were often begrudgingly accepted. He opened his own gallery in 1804 and became professor of perspective at the academy in 1807, where he lectured until 1828, although he was viewed as profoundly inarticulate. He travelled to Europe from 1802, typically returning with voluminous sketchbooks. Intensely private, eccentric and reclusive, Turner was a controversial figure throughout his career. He did not marry, but fathered two daughters, Eveline (1801‚Äì1874) and Georgiana (1811‚Äì1843), by his housekeeper Sarah Danby. He became more pessimistic and morose as he got older, especially after the death of his father, after which his outlook deteriorated, his gallery fell into disrepair and neglect, and his art intensified. In 1841 Turner rowed a boat into the Thames so he could not be counted as present at any property in that year's census. He lived in squalor and poor health from 1845, and died in London in 1851 aged 76. Turner is buried in Saint Paul's Cathedral, London.  Biography  = Early life = Maiden Lane where Turner was born, c.1850s Joseph Mallord William Turner was born on 23 April 1775 and baptised on 14 May. He was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, in London, England. His father, William Turner (1745 - 21 September 1829), was a barber and wig maker. His mother, Mary Marshall, came from a family of butchers. A younger sister, Mary Ann, was born in September 1778 but died in August 1783. Turner's mother showed signs of mental disturbance from 1785 and was admitted to St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics in Old Street in 1799 and was moved in 1800 to Bethlem Hospital, a mental asylum, where she died in 1804. Turner was sent to his maternal uncle, Joseph Mallord William Marshall, in Brentford, then a small town on the banks of the River Thames west of London. The earliest known artistic exercise by Turner is from this period‚Äîa series of simple colourings of engraved plates from Henry Boswell's Picturesque View of the Antiquities of England and Wales. Around 1786, Turner was sent to Margate on the north-east Kent coast. There he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area that foreshadowed his later work. By this time, Turner's drawings were being exhibited in his father's shop window and sold for a few shillings. His father boasted to the artist Thomas Stothard that: \\"My son, sir, is going to be a painter\\". In 1789, Turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to Sunningwell in Berkshire (now part of Oxfordshire). A whole sketchbook of work from this time in Berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of Oxford. The use of pencil sketches on location, as the foundation for later finished paintings, formed the basis of Turner's essential working style for his whole career. Many early sketches by Turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective, and it is known that, as a young man, he worked for several architects including Thomas Hardwick, James Wyatt and Joseph Bonomi the Elder. By the end of 1789, he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman Thomas Malton, specialised in London views. Turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade, copying and colouring outline prints of British castles and abbeys. He would later call Malton \\"My real master\\". Topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies. = Royal Academy = Modern Rome ‚Äì Campo Vaccino, 1839 Turner entered the Royal Academy of Art in 1789, aged 14, and was accepted into the academy a year later by Sir Joshua Reynolds. He showed an early interest in architecture, but was advised by Thomas Hardwick to focus on painting. His first watercolour, A View of the Archbishop's Palace, Lambeth was accepted for the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1790 when Turner was 15. As an academy probationer, Turner was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures. From July 1790 to October 1793, his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times. In June 1792, he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models. Turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout Britain, particularly to Wales, where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours. These particularly focused on architectural work, which used his skills as a draughtsman. In 1793, he showed the watercolour titled The Rising Squall ‚Äì Hot Wells from St Vincent's Rock Bristol (now lost), which foreshadowed his later climatic effects. Cunningham in his obituary of Turner wrote that it was: \\"recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipidities...[and] evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated\\". Fishermen at Sea, exhibited in 1796 was the first oil painting exhibited by Turner at the Royal Academy. In 1796, Turner exhibited Fishermen at Sea, his first oil painting for the academy, of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the Needles off the Isle of Wight, an image of boats in peril. Wilton said that the image was \\"a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century\\". and shows strong influence by artists such as Claude Joseph Vernet, Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter Monamy and Francis Swaine, who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings. The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner's reputation as both an oil painter of maritime scenes. = Early career = Charles Turner, c. 1840, Portrait of J. M. W. Turner, making his sketch for the celebrated picture of 'Mercury & Argus' (exhibited in 1836) Turner traveled widely in Europe, starting with France and Switzerland in 1802 and studying in the Louvre in Paris in the same year. He made many visits to Venice. Important support for his work came from Walter Ramsden Fawkes of Farnley Hall, near Otley in Yorkshire, who became a close friend of the artist. Turner first visited Otley in 1797, aged 22, when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area. He was so attracted to Otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career. The stormy backdrop of Hannibal Crossing The Alps is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the Chevin in Otley while he was staying at Farnley Hall. Turner was a frequent guest of George O'Brien Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, at Petworth House in West Sussex and painted scenes that Egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the Sussex countryside, including a view of the Chichester Canal. Petworth House still displays a number of paintings. = Personal life = As Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant. His father's death in 1829 had a profound effect on him, and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression. He never married but had a relationship with an older widow, Sarah Danby (1760 or 1766 (christened) ‚Äì1861). He is believed to have been the father of her two daughters Evalina Dupois (1801‚Äì1874) and Georgiana Thompson (1811‚Äì1843). Linnell (1838) Turner formed a relationship with Sophia Caroline Booth (1798‚Äì1875) after her second husband died, and he lived for about 18 years as \\"Mr Booth\\" in her house in Chelsea. Turner was a habitual user of snuff; in 1838, Louis Philippe I, King of the French presented a gold snuff box to him. Of two other snuffboxes, an agate and silver example bears Turner's name, and another, made of wood, was collected along with his spectacles, magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper. Turner formed a short but intense friendship with the artist Edward Thomas Daniell. The painter David Roberts wrote of him that, \\"He adored Turner, when I and others doubted, and taught me to see & to distinguish his beauties over that of others ... the old man really had a fond & personal regard for this young clergyman, which I doubt he ever evinced for the other\\". Daniell may have supplied Turner with the spiritual comfort he needed after the deaths of his father and friends, and to \\"ease the fears of a naturally reflective man approaching old age\\". After Daniell's death in Lycia at the age of 38, he told Roberts he would never form such a friendship again. Before leaving for the Middle East, Daniell commissioned his portrait from John Linnell. Turner had previously refused to sit for the artist, and it was difficult to get his agreement to be portrayed. Daniell positioned the two men opposite each other at dinner, so that Linnell could observe his subject carefully and portray his likeness from memory. = Death = Turner died of cholera at the home of Sophia Caroline Booth, in Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, on 19 December 1851. He is buried in St Paul's Cathedral, where he lies near to Sir Joshua Reynolds.David Blayney Brown, 'Joseph Mallord William Turner 1775‚Äì1851', artist biography, December 2012, in David Blayney Brown (ed.), J.M.W. Turner: Sketchbooks, Drawings and Watercolours, Tate Research Publication, December 2012, , accessed 18 December 2017. Apparently his last words were \\"The Sun is God\\", though this may be apocryphal. Turner's friend, the architect Philip Hardwick (1792‚Äì1870), son of his tutor, Thomas Hardwick, was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew Turner to tell them at the time of his death that, \\"I must inform you, we have lost him.\\" Other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral, Henry Harpur IV (benefactor of Westminster ‚Äì now Chelsea & Westminster ‚Äì Hospital), Revd. Henry Scott Trimmer, George Jones RA and Charles Turner ARA.  Art  = Style = Turner's talent was recognised early in his life. Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely; his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. According to David Piper's The Illustrated History of Art, his later pictures were called \\"fantastic puzzles\\". Turner was recognised as an artistic genius: the influential English art critic John Ruskin described him as the artist who could most \\"stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of Nature\\".(Piper 321) Turner's work drew criticism from contemporaries, in particular from Sir George Beaumont, a landscape painter and fellow member of the Royal Academy, who described his paintings as 'blots'. Turner's imagination was sparked by shipwrecks, fires (including the burning of Parliament in 1834, an event which Turner witnessed first-hand, and transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches), and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen in Dawn after the Wreck (1840) and The Slave Ship (1840). Turner's major venture into printmaking was the Liber Studiorum (Book of Studies), seventy prints that he worked on from 1806 to 1819. The Liber Studiorum was an expression of his intentions for landscape art. The idea was loosely based on Claude Lorrain's Liber Veritatis (Book of Truth), where Lorrain had recorded his completed paintings; a series of print copies of these drawings, by then at Devonshire House, had been a huge publishing success. Turner's plates were meant to be widely disseminated, and categorised the genre into six types: Marine, Mountainous, Pastoral, Historical, Architectural, and Elevated or Epic Pastoral. His printmaking was a major part of his output, and a museum is devoted to it, the Turner Museum in Sarasota, Florida, founded in 1974 by Douglass Montrose-Graem to house his collection of Turner prints. His early works, such as Tintern Abbey (1795), stay true to the traditions of English landscape. In Hannibal Crossing the Alps (1812), an emphasis on the destructive power of nature has already come into play. His distinctive style of painting, in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints, created lightness, fluency, and ephemeral atmospheric effects.Piper 321 In Turner's later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour. A prime example of his mature style can be seen in Rain, Steam and Speed ‚Äì The Great Western Railway, where the objects are barely recognisable. The intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed Turner's work in the vanguard of English painting but exerted an influence on art in France; the Impressionists, particularly Claude Monet, carefully studied his techniques. He is also generally regarded as a precursor of abstract painting. High levels of volcanic ash (from the eruption of Mt. Tambora) in the atmosphere during 1816, the \\"Year Without a Summer\\", led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, and were an inspiration for some of Turner's work. John Ruskin said that an early patron, Thomas Monro, Principal Physician of Bedlam, and a collector and amateur artist, was a significant influence on Turner's style: > His true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron > and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was > disciplined by him and companioned by his friend Girtin, the healthy and > constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the > greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate. Together with a number of young artists, Turner was able, in Monro's London house, to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing. But the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of John Robert Cozens's watercolours, some of which were present in Monro's house, went far further than the neat renderings of topography. The solemn grandeur of his Alpine views were an early revelation to the young Turner and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium, conveying mood instead of information. = Materials = Turner experimented with a wide variety of pigment. He used pigments like carmine, despite knowing that they were not long-lasting, and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments. As a result, many of his colours have now faded. Ruskin complained at how quickly his work decayed; Turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied. By 1930, there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading.

He planned an almshouse at Twickenham with a gallery for some of his works. His will was contested and in 1856, after a court battle, his first cousins, including Thomas Price Turner, received part of his fortune. Another portion went to the Royal Academy of Arts, which occasionally awards students the Turner Medal. His finished paintings were bequeathed to the British nation, and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them. This did not happen due to disagreement over the final site. Twenty-two years after his death, the British Parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside London, and so began the process of scattering the pictures which Turner had wanted to be kept together. In 1910, the main part of the Turner Bequest, which includes unfinished paintings and drawings, was rehoused in the Duveen Turner Wing at the National Gallery of British Art (now Tate Britain). In 1987, a new wing at the Tate, the Clore Gallery, was opened to house the Turner bequest, though some of the most important paintings remain in the National Gallery in contravention of Turner's condition that they be kept and shown together. Increasingly paintings are lent abroad, ignoring Turner's provision that they remain constantly and permanently in Turner's Gallery. St. Mary's Church, Battersea added a commemorative stained glass window for Turner, between 1976 and 1982. St Paul's Cathedral, Royal Academy of Arts and Victoria & Albert Museum all hold statues representing him. A portrait by Cornelius Varley with his patent graphic telescope (Sheffield Museums & Galleries) was compared with his death mask (National Portrait Gallery, London) by Kelly Freeman at Dundee University 2009‚Äì10 to ascertain whether it really depicts Turner. The city of Westminster unveiled a memorial plaque at the site of his birthplace at 21 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden 2 June 1999. Selby Whittingham founded The Turner Society at London and Manchester in 1975. After the society endorsed the Tate Gallery's Clore Gallery wing (on the lines of the Duveen wing of 1910), as the solution to the controversy of what should be done with the Turner Bequest, Selby Whittingham resigned and founded the Independent Turner Society. The Tate created the prestigious annual Turner Prize art award in 1984, named in Turner's honour, and 20 years later the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours founded the Winsor & Newton Turner Watercolour Award. A major exhibition, \\"Turner's Britain\\", with material (including The Fighting Temeraire) on loan from around the globe, was held at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery from 7 November 2003 to 8 February 2004. In 2005, Turner's The Fighting Temeraire was voted Britain's \\"greatest painting\\" in a public poll organised by the BBC.  Portrayal in culture  Leo McKern played Turner in The Sun is God, a 1974 Thames Television production directed by Michael Darlow. The programme aired on 17 December 1974, during the Turner Bicentenary Exhibition in London. British filmmaker Mike Leigh wrote and directed Mr. Turner, a biopic of Turner's later years, released in 2014. The film starred Timothy Spall as Turner, Dorothy Atkinson, Marion Bailey and Paul Jesson, and premiered in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, with Spall taking the award for Best Actor. The Bank of England announced that a portrait of Turner, with a backdrop of The Fighting Temeraire, would appear on the ¬£20 note beginning in 2020. It is the first ¬£20 British banknote printed on polymer. It came into circulation on Thursday 20 February 2020.  Notes   References   Sources   * Finberg, A. J. The Life of J. M. W. Turner, R.A.

He was Lord Protector of England from 1547 to 1549 during the minority of his nephew King Edward VI (1547‚Äì1553). Despite his popularity with the common people, his policies often angered the gentry and he was overthrown. Origins and early career Edward Seymour was born c. 1500, the son of Sir John Seymour (1474‚Äì1536), feudal baron of Hatch Beauchamp in Somerset, by his wife Margery Wentworth, eldest daughter of Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, Suffolk, and descended from Edward III. In 1514, aged about 14, he received an appointment in the household of Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and was enfant d‚Äôhonneur at her marriage with Louis XII. Seymour served in the Duke of Suffolk's campaign in France in 1523, being knighted by the duke on 1 November, and accompanied Cardinal Wolsey on his embassy to France in 1527. Appointed Esquire of the Body to Henry VIII in 1529, he grew in favour with the king, who visited his manor at Elvetham in Hampshire in October 1535. Rise under Henry When Seymour's sister, Jane, married King Henry VIII in 1536, Edward was created Viscount Beauchamp on 5 June 1536, and Earl of Hertford on 15 October 1537. He became Warden of the Scottish Marches and continued in royal favour after his sister's death on 24 October 1537. In 1541, during Henry's absence in the north, Hertford, Thomas Cranmer and Thomas Audley had the chief management of affairs in London. In September 1542 he was appointed Warden of the Scottish Marches, and a few months later Lord High Admiral, a post which he almost immediately relinquished in favour of John Dudley, the future duke of Northumberland. In March 1544 he was made lieutenant-general of the north and instructed to punish the Scots for their repudiation of the treaty of marriage between Prince Edward and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots. He landed at Leith on 3 May 1544, captured and pillaged Edinburgh, and returned by land burning villages and castles along the way. In July 1544 he was appointed lieutenant of the realm under the queen regent during Henry's absence at Boulogne, but in August he joined the king and was present at the surrender of the town. In the autumn he was one of the commissioners sent to Flanders to keep Charles V to the terms of his treaty with England, and in January 1545 he was placed in command at Boulogne, where on the 26th he repelled an attempt of Marshal de Biez to recapture the town. In May he was once more appointed lieutenant-general in the north to avenge the Scottish victory at the Battle of Ancrum Moor; this he did by a savage foray into Scotland in September. In March 1546 he was sent back to Boulogne to supersede the Earl of Surrey, whose command had not been a success; and in June he was engaged in negotiations for peace with France and for the delimitation of the English conquests. From October to the end of Henry's reign he was in attendance on the king, engaged in the struggle for predominance which was to determine the complexion of the government during the coming minority. Personal, political and religious rivalry separated him and Baron Lisle from the Howards, and Surrey's hasty temper precipitated his own ruin and that of and his father, the duke of Norfolk. They could not acquiesce in the Imperial ambassador's verdict that Hertford and Lisle were the only noblemen of fit age and capacity to carry on the government; and Surrey's attempt to secure the predominance of his family led to his own execution and to his father's imprisonment in the Tower of London. Seymour's Protectorate =Council of Regency= Upon the death of Henry VIII (28 January 1547), Seymour's nephew became king as Edward VI. Henry VIII's will named sixteen executors, who were to act as Edward's Council until he reached the age of 18. These executors were supplemented by twelve men \\"of counsail\\" who would assist the executors when called on.; The final state of Henry VIII's will has occasioned controversy. Some historians suggest that those close to the king manipulated either him or the will itself to ensure a shareout of power to their benefit, both material and religious. In this reading, the composition of the Privy Chamber shifted towards the end of 1546 in favour of the Protestant faction. In addition, two leading conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power. Stephen Gardiner was refused access to Henry during his last months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; on 24‚Äì25 December, he offered his vast estates to the Crown making them available for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London., incorrectly dates the surrender to 12 January, the date of Norfolk's final confession of treason; see also . In his letter offering his lands, now lost but quoted in Herbert of Cherbury, Henry the Eight (1649), 566, Norfolk asserted that he was as innocent as \\"the childe that was born this night\\", the Christ child born on Christmas Day. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion had non- religious causes, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the council, and that the radicalism of men such as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable.. In addressing these views, Loach cites, among others: G. Redworth, In Defence of the Church Catholic: the Life of Stephen Gardiner (Oxford, 1990), 231‚Äì37; Susan Brigden, \\"Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and the Conjoured League\\", Historical Journal, xxxvii (1994), 507‚Äì37; and Eric Ives, \\"Henry VIII's Will: A Forensic Conundrum\\", Historical Journal (1992), 792‚Äì99. Whatever the case, Henry's death was followed by a lavish hand-out of lands and honours to the new power group. The will contained an \\"unfulfilled gifts\\" clause, added at the last minute, which allowed Henry's executors to freely distribute lands and honours to themselves and the court,; David Starkey describes this distribution of benefits as typical of \\"the shameless back-scratching of the alliance\\"; G. R. Elton calls the changes to the will \\"convenient\\". particularly to Seymour (then known as Earl of Hertford), who became the Lord Protector of the Realm and Governor of the King's Person, and who created himself Duke of Somerset. Henry VIII's will did not provide for the appointment of a Protector. It entrusted the government of the realm during his son's minority to a Regency Council that would rule collectively, by majority decision, with \\"like and equal charge\\".; The existence of a council of executors alongside the Privy Council was rationalised in March when the two became one, incorporating the executors and most of their appointed assistants and adding Thomas Seymour, who had protested at his exclusion from power. Nevertheless, a few days after Henry's death, on 4 February, the executors chose to invest almost regal power in Edward Seymour.; Thirteen out of the sixteen (the others being absent) agreed to his appointment as Protector, which they justified as their joint decision \\"by virtue of the authority\\" of Henry's will.; Seymour may have done a deal with some of the executors, who almost all received hand-outs.; He is known to have done so with William Paget, private secretary to Henry VIII,In 1549, Paget was to remind Seymour: \\"Remember what you promised me in the gallery at Westminster before the breath was out of the body of the king that dead is. Remember what you promised immediately after, devising with me concerning the place which you now occupy ... and that was to follow mine advice in all your proceedings more than any other man's\\". Quoted in and to have secured the support of Sir Anthony Browne of the Privy Chamber. Seymour's appointment was in keeping with historical precedent,; Uncles of the king had been made Protector in 1422 and 1483 during the minorities of Henry VI and Edward V (though not also Governor of the King's Person, as Hertford's brother Thomas, who coveted the role for himself, pointed out). and his eligibility for the role was reinforced by his military successes in Scotland and France. He was senior to his ally Lisle in the peerage, and was the new king's closest relative. In March 1547, he secured letters patent from King Edward granting him the almost monarchical right to appoint members to the Privy Council himself and to consult them only when he wished. ; In 1549, William Paget described him as king in all but name. In the words of historian G. R. Elton, \\"from that moment his autocratic system was complete\\". He proceeded to rule largely by proclamation, calling on the Privy Council to do little more than rubber-stamp his decisions. Seymour's takeover of power was smooth and efficient. The imperial ambassador, Francis Van der Delft, reported that he \\"governs everything absolutely\\", with Paget operating as his secretary, though he predicted trouble from John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, who had recently been raised to Earl of Warwick in the share-out of honours.; In fact, in the early weeks of his Protectorate, Seymour met opposition only from the Chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, whom the Earldom of Southampton had evidently failed to buy off, and from his own brother. Wriothesley, a religious conservative, objected to Seymour's assumption of monarchical power over the council. He then found himself abruptly dismissed from the chancellorship on charges of selling off some of his offices to delegates.; In his first parliament, which met in November 1547, he procured the repeal of all the heresy laws and nearly all the treason laws passed since Edward III. He sought to win over the Scots by those promises of autonomy, free trade, and equal privileges with England. But the Scots were not to be won over yet, and would not be persuaded; the protector led another army into Scotland in September 1547, and won the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh on 10 September. He trusted to the garrisons he established throughout the Lowlands to wear down Scottish opposition; but their pressure was soon weakened by troubles in England and abroad, and Mary was transported to France to marry Francis II in 1557. Seymour also attempted to bring uniformity to forms of worship, and in 1549 the first Act of Uniformity introduced a Book of Common Prayer that attempted to compromise between different forms of learning; it was replaced by a more severe form in 1552 after his fall. =Thomas Seymour= Thomas Seymour, Lord Admiral and brother of Edward Seymour Edward Seymour faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother Thomas, who has been described as a \\"worm in the bud\\". As King Edward's uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the king's person and a greater share of power. Seymour tried to buy his brother off with a barony, an appointment to the Lord Admiralship, and a seat on the Privy Council‚Äîbut Thomas was bent on scheming for power. He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that the Duke of Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a \\"beggarly king\\". He also urged him to throw off the Protector within two years and \\"bear rule as other kings do\\"; but Edward, schooled to defer to the council, failed to co-operate.; In April 1547, using King Edward's support to circumvent his brother's opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly married Henry VIII's widow Catherine Parr, whose Protestant household included the 11-year-old Lady Jane Grey and the 13-year- old Princess Elizabeth. In summer 1548, a pregnant Catherine Parr discovered Thomas Seymour embracing Princess Elizabeth. As a result, Elizabeth was removed from Catherine Parr's household and transferred to Sir Anthony Denny's. That September, Catherine Parr died in childbirth, and Thomas Seymour promptly resumed his attentions to Elizabeth by letter, planning to marry her. Elizabeth was receptive, but, like Edward, unready to agree to anything unless permitted by the council. In January 1549, the council had Thomas Seymour arrested on various charges, including embezzlement at the Bristol mint. King Edward himself testified about the pocket money.; Most importantly, Thomas Seymour had sought to officially receive the governorship of King Edward, as no earlier Lord Protectors, unlike Edward Seymour, had ever held both functions. Lack of clear evidence for treason ruled out a trial, so Thomas was condemned instead by an Act of Attainder and beheaded on 20 March 1549. =War= Edward Seymour's only undoubted skill was as a soldier, which he had proved on his expeditions to Scotland and in the defence of Boulogne in 1546. From the first, his main interest as Protector was the war against Scotland.; After a crushing victory at the Battle of Pinkie in September 1547, he set up a network of garrisons in Scotland, stretching as far north as Dundee. His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction, as his aim of uniting the realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic. The Scots allied with France, who sent reinforcements for the defence of Edinburgh in 1548, while Mary, Queen of Scots, was removed to France, where she was betrothed to the dauphin.; The dauphin was the future Francis II of France, son of Henry II of France. The cost of maintaining the Protector's massive armies and his permanent garrisons in Scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on the royal finances. A French attack on Boulogne in August 1549 at last forced Seymour to begin a withdrawal from Scotland. =Rebellion= During 1548, England was subject to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose mainly from the imposition of church services in English, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protestors believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.; For example, in Hereford, a man was recorded as saying that \\"by the king's proclamation all enclosures were to be broken up\\". The same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, not only in Norfolk and the west. The origin of the popular view of Edward Seymour as sympathetic to the rebel cause lies partly in his series of sometimes liberal, often contradictory, proclamations.; Some proclamations expressed sympathy for the victims of enclosure and announced action; some condemned the destruction of enclosures and associated riots; another announced pardons for those who had destroyed enclosures by mistake (\\"of folly and of mistaking\\") after misunderstanding the meaning of proclamations, so long as they were sorry. and partly in the uncoordinated activities of the commissions he sent out in 1548 and 1549 to investigate grievances about loss of tillage, encroachment of large sheep flocks on common land, and similar issues. Seymour's commissions were led by the evangelical M.P. John Hales, whose socially liberal rhetoric linked the issue of enclosure with Reformation theology and the notion of a godly commonwealth.; Local groups often assumed that the findings of these commissions entitled them to act against offending landlords themselves.\\"Their aim was not to bring down government, but to help it correct the faults of local magistrates and identify the ways in which England could be reformed.\\" King Edward wrote in his Chronicle that the 1549 risings began \\"because certain commissions were sent down to pluck down enclosures\\". Whatever the popular view of the Duke of Somerset, the disastrous events of 1549 were taken as evidence of a colossal failure of government, and the Council laid the responsibility at the Protector's door. In July 1549, Paget wrote to Seymour: \\"Every man of the council have misliked your proceedings ... would to God, that, at the first stir you had followed the matter hotly, and caused justice to be ministered in solemn fashion to the terror of others ...\\". =Fall from power= The sequence of events that led to Seymour's removal from power has often been called a coup d'√©tat. By 1 October 1549, Seymour had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat. He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king's person, and withdrew for safety to the fortified Windsor Castle, where Edward wrote, \\"Me thinks I am in prison\\". Meanwhile, a united Council published details of Seymour's government mismanagement. They made clear that the Protector's power came from them, not from Henry VIII's will. On 11 October, the council had Seymour arrested and brought the king to Richmond. Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his Chronicle: \\"ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc.\\"Quoted in . By \\"Newhaven\\" is meant Ambleteuse, near Boulogne. In February 1550, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, emerged as the leader of the Council and, in effect, as Seymour's successor. Although Seymour was released from the Tower and restored to the council in early 1550, in October 1551 he was sent to the Tower on an exaggerated charge of treason. Instead, he was executed for felony (that of seeking a change of government) in January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley's regime.; Edward noted his uncle's death in his Chronicle: \\"the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o'clock in the morning\\". Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset was interred at St. Peter ad Vincula, Tower of London. =Historiography= Historians have contrasted the efficiency of Edward Seymour's takeover of power in 1547 with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule.; By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. Until recent decades, Seymour's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class.; . In the early 20th century this line was taken by the influential A. F. Pollard, to be echoed by Edward VI's 1960s biographer W. K. Jordan. A more critical approach was initiated by M. L. Bush and Dale Hoak in the mid-1970s. Since then, the first Duke of Somerset has often been portrayed as an arrogant ruler, devoid of the political and administrative skills necessary for governing the Tudor state.David Loades, \\"The reign of Edward VI: An historiographical survey\\" Historian 67#1 (2000): 22+ online Marriages and progeny thumb200pxMonument to Lord Edward Seymour (d.1593), and to his son and daughter-in-law, Berry Pomeroy Church. *Top step: Lord Edward Seymour (d. 1593) *Middle step: Sir Edward Seymour, 1st Baronet (d. 1613) *Bottom step: Elizabeth Champernowne, wife of 1st Baronet *Base: Children of Sir Edward and Elizabeth Edward Seymour married twice: *Firstly in about 1527, to Catherine Fillol (or Filliol) (c. 1507‚Äì1535), a daughter and co-heiress of Sir William Fillol (1453‚Äì1527), of Fillol's Hall, Essex and Woodlands, Horton, Dorset.Vivian, Heraldic Visitations of Devon, 1895, p.702, pedigree of Seymour Catherine bore two sons, whose paternity however was questioned by her husband after it was alleged that she had had an affair (possibly with her father-in- law, Sir John Seymour), which resulted in both being excluded in 1540 from their paternal and maternal inheritances and all their claims to their father's dignities being postponed to his children by his second wife.Locke, A. Audrey, The Seymour Family: History and Romance, London, 1911, p.193 Ironically these two sons remained faithful to their father during his misfortunes and both were imprisoned with him in the Tower of London:  John Seymour (1527 ‚Äì 19 December 1552), sent to the Tower of London where he died in December 1552,Locke, A. Audrey, The Seymour Family: History and Romance, London, 1911, p.193 having survived his father by 11 months. He successfully petitioned Parliament for the restoration of his maternal inheritance, but as her lands had been sold, he was awarded compensation in the form of the estate of Maiden Bradley, an Augustinian Priory in Wiltshire granted to his father at the Dissolution of the Monasteries by King Henry VIII, which had descended to his half-siblings.Locke, A. Audrey, The Seymour Family: History and Romance, London, 1911, p.194 However, he did not live to enjoy the grant and bequeathed it with all his other lands and goods to his younger brother Lord Edward Seymour.  Lord Edward Seymour (1529‚Äì1593)His name was officially Lord Edward Seymour, being not the designation of a baron but the courtesy title of the son of a duke. Per Vivian, Herald's Visitations of Devon, 1895, p.702, pedigree of Seymour of Berry Pomeroy, as confirmed by the inscription on his monument in Berry Pomeroy Church: Here lyeth the bodies of the Honorable Lord Edward Seymour, knight, sonne unto th Right Honorable Edward Seymour Duke of Somerset... of Berry Pomeroy, Devon, Sheriff of Devon.The Complete Peerage vol.XIIpI, p.84 He was sent to the Tower of London in 1551 but was later released, and became heir to his elder brother, from whom he inherited Maiden Bradley, today the seat of his descendant, the present Duke of Somerset. Anne Stanhope *Secondly, before 9 March 1535, to Anne Stanhope (c. 1510‚Äì1587), only child and sole heiress of Sir Edward Stanhope (1462‚Äì1511) by his wife Elizabeth Bourchier (c. 1473‚Äì1557), daughter of Fulk Bourchier, 10th Baron FitzWarin (1445‚Äì1479). Seymour's suspicions about the fathering of Catherine Fillol's sons led him to pass an Act of Parliament in 1540, entailing his estates away from the children of his first wife in favour of the children of Anne Stanhope. By Anne, he had ten children: Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp of Hache (12 October 15371539), known by the courtesy title of one of his father's subsidiary titles. He died as a two-year old infant and predeceased his father. Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (22 May 15391621), in 1559 created Earl of Hertford and Baron Beauchamp of Hatch by Queen Elizabeth I, the half-sister of King Edward VI. He married three times: firstly in November 1560, Lady Catherine Grey, by whom he had two sons; secondly in 1582 to Frances Howard, daughter of Baron Howard of Effingham; thirdly in 1601 to Frances Prannell. Lady Anne Seymour (1538‚Äì1588), who married twice: firstly to John Dudley, 2nd Earl of Warwick; secondly to Sir Edward Unton, MP, by whom she had issue. Lord Henry Seymour (1540‚Äì?) married Lady Joan Percy, daughter of Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland Lady Margaret Seymour (born 1540) a noted Elizabethan author Lady Jane Seymour (1541‚Äì1561) Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth I, also a noted Elizabethan author Lady Catherine Seymour Lord Edward Seymour (1548‚Äì1574), died unmarried and without issue Lady Mary Seymour (born 1552) married twice: *Firstly (as his second wife) to Andrew Rogers (died c. 1599), MP, of Bryanstone, Dorset; without progeny. Her nephew Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (1561‚Äì1612) later married Andrew's \\"notorious\\" sister Honora Rogers, despite the strong opposition of his father Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (1539‚Äì1621). Honora was referred to as \\"a baggage\\", and Lord Beauchamp had originally intended to have \\"but a night‚Äôs lodging with her\\". Honora's son was William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset (1588‚Äì1660) *Secondly she married Sir Henry Peyton, and thirdly Francis Cosby. Lady Elizabeth Seymour (1552 ‚Äì 3 June 1602), who married Sir Richard Knightley, of Fawsley, Northamptonshire. Her monument with effigy survives in All Saints church, Norton, Northamptonshire.See image :File:LadyElizabethSeymour Died1602 WifeOf SirRichardKnightley NortonChurch Northamptonshire.jpg The male line of Edward Seymour and Anne Stanhope died out with the seventh Duke of Somerset in 1750, when the descendants of Edward Seymour by his first wife, Catherine Fillol, inherited the Somerset dukedom in accordance with the Private Act of 1541. However, the female line continued, and Queen Elizabeth II is descended from Somerset through his grandchild by Catherine Grey.

In Sk√≠rnism√°l, Freyr sneaks into Hli√∞skj√°lf when he looks into J√∂tunheimr and sees the beautiful giant maiden Ger√∞r, with whom he instantly falls in love. Prose Edda In Gylfaginning, Snorri mentions the high seat on four occasions. In the first instance he seems to refer to it rather as a dwelling place: \\"There is one abode called Hli√∞skj√°lf, and when Allfather sat in the high seat there, he looked out over the whole world and saw every man's acts, and knew all things which he saw.\\" However, later he explicitly refers to it as the high seat itself: \\"Another great abode is there, which is named Valaskj√°lf. Odin possesses that dwelling. The gods made it and thatched it with sheer silver, and in this hall is the Hli√∞skj√°lf, the high seat so called. Whenever Allfather sits in that seat, he surveys all lands.\\" The third mention made of Hli√∞skj√°lf is during Snorri's recounting of the wooing of Gerd, quoted by him from Sk√≠rnism√°l. Lastly, Snorri relates how Odin used the high seat to find Loki after he fled from the scene of his murder of Baldr.

As a predicate or complement \\"nothing\\" is the absence of meaning, value, worth, relevance, standing, or significance (\\"It is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/ Signifying nothing\\"; \\"The affair meant nothing\\"; \\"I'm nothing in their eyes\\").\\"Nothing\\", Merriam-Webster Dictionary \\"Nothingness\\" is a philosophical term for the general state of nonexistence, sometimes reified as a domain or dimension into which things pass when they cease to exist or out of which they may come to exist, e.g., God is understood to have created the universe ex nihilo, \\"out of nothing\\".definition of suffix \\"-ness\\" - \\"the state of being\\", Yourdictionary.com, [www.yourdictionary.com/ness-suffix] Philosophy =Western philosophy= Some would consider the study of \\"nothing\\" to be foolish. A typical response of this type is voiced by Giacomo Casanova (1725‚Äì1798) in conversation with his landlord, one Dr. Gozzi, who also happens to be a priest: However, \\"nothingness\\" has been treated as a serious subject for a very long time. In philosophy, to avoid linguistic traps over the meaning of \\"nothing\\", a phrase such as not-being is often employed to make clear what is being discussed. Parmenides One of the earliest Western philosophers to consider nothing as a concept was Parmenides (5th century BC), who was a Greek philosopher of the monist school. He argued that \\"nothing\\" cannot exist by the following line of reasoning: To speak of a thing, one has to speak of a thing that exists. Since we can speak of a thing in the past, this thing must still exist (in some sense) now, and from this he concludes that there is no such thing as change. As a corollary, there can be no such things as coming-into-being, passing-out-of-being, or not- being.Russell, pp. 66‚Äì70. Parmenides was taken seriously by other philosophers, influencing, for instance, Socrates and Plato.Russell, pp. 66‚Äì67. Aristotle gives Parmenides serious consideration but concludes, \\"Although these opinions seem to follow logically in a dialectical discussion, yet to believe them seems next door to madness when one considers the facts.\\"Aristotle, On Generation and Corruption, I:8, 350 BC, translator H. H. Joachim, The Internet Classics Archive, retrieved 24 January 2009.Russell, p. 85Walter E. Wehrle, The Myth of Aristotle's Development and the Betrayal of Metaphysics, p. 77, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2001 . In modern times, Albert Einstein's concept of spacetime has led many scientists, including Einstein himself, to adopt a position remarkably similar to Parmenides.Karl Popper, The World of Parmenides: Essays on the Presocratic Enlightenment, p. 172, Routledge, 2013 . On the death of his friend Michele Besso, Einstein consoled his widow with the words, \\"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That signifies nothing. For those of us that believe in physics, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\\" Gary Mar, \\"G√∂del's ontological dream\\", ch. 36 in Shyam Wuppuluri, Giancarlo Ghirardi (eds), Space, Time and the Limits of Human Understanding, p. 469, Springer, 2016 . Leucippus Leucippus (early 5th century BC), one of the atomists, along with other philosophers of his time, made attempts to reconcile this monism with the everyday observation of motion and change. He accepted the monist position that there could be no motion without a void. The void is the opposite of being. It is not-being. On the other hand, there exists something known as an absolute plenum, a space filled with matter, and there can be no motion in a plenum because it is completely full. But, there is not just one monolithic plenum, for existence consists of a multiplicity of plenums. These are the invisibly small \\"atoms\\" of Greek atomist theory, later expanded by Democritus (c. 460‚Äì370 BC), which allows the void to \\"exist\\" between them. In this scenario, macroscopic objects can come-into-being, move through space, and pass into not-being by means of the coming together and moving apart of their constituent atoms. The void must exist to allow this to happen, or else the \\"frozen world\\" of Parmenides must be accepted. Bertrand Russell points out that this does not exactly defeat the argument of Parmenides but, rather, ignores it by taking the rather modern scientific position of starting with the observed data (motion, etc.) and constructing a theory based on the data, as opposed to Parmenides' attempts to work from pure logic. Russell also observes that both sides were mistaken in believing that there can be no motion in a plenum, but arguably motion cannot start in a plenum.Russell, pp. 85‚Äì87. Cyril Bailey notes that Leucippus is the first to say that a \\"thing\\" (the void) might be real without being a body and points out the irony that this comes from a materialistic atomist. Leucippus is therefore the first to say that \\"nothing\\" has a reality attached to it.Cyril Bailey, The Greek Atomists and Epicurus: A Study, pp. 75‚Äì76, The Clarendon Press, 1928. Aristotle, Newton, Descartes Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC) provided the classic escape from the logical problem posed by Parmenides by distinguishing things that are matter and things that are space. In this scenario, space is not \\"nothing\\" but, rather, a receptacle in which objects of matter can be placed. The true void (as \\"nothing\\") is different from \\"space\\" and is removed from consideration.Aristotle, Categories, I:6, 350 BC, translator, E. M. Edghill, The Internet Classics Archive retrieved 24 January 2009.Aristotle, Categories, III:7, 350 BC, translator, J. L. Stocks, The Internet Classics Archive retrieved 24 January 2009. This characterization of space reached its pinnacle with Isaac Newton who asserted the existence of absolute space. Ren√© Descartes, on the other hand, returned to a Parmenides- like argument of denying the existence of space. For Descartes, there was matter, and there was extension of matter leaving no room for the existence of \\"nothing\\".Russell, p. 87. The idea that space can actually be empty was generally still not accepted by philosophers who invoked arguments similar to the plenum reasoning. Although Descartes views on this were challenged by Blaise Pascal, he declined to overturn the traditional belief, horror vacui, commonly stated as \\"nature abhors a vacuum\\". This remained so until Evangelista Torricelli invented the barometer in 1643 and showed that an empty space appeared if the mercury tube was turned upside down. This phenomenon being known as the Torricelli vacuum and the unit of vacuum pressure, the torr, being named after him. Even Torricelli's teacher, the famous Galileo Galilei had previously been unable to adequately explain the sucking action of a pump.Pieper, pp. 237‚Äì238. John the Scot John the Scot, or Johannes Scotus Eriugena (c. 815‚Äì877) held many surprisingly heretical beliefs for the time he lived in for which no action appears ever to have been taken against him. His ideas mostly stem from, or are based on his work of translating pseudo-Dionysius. His beliefs are essentially pantheist and he classifies evil, amongst many other things, into not-being. This is done on the grounds that evil is the opposite of good, a quality of God, but God can have no opposite, since God is everything in the pantheist view of the world. Similarly, the idea that God created the world out of \\"nothing\\" is to be interpreted as meaning that the \\"nothing\\" here is synonymous with God.Russell, pp. 396‚Äì401. G. W. F. Hegel Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770‚Äì1831) is the philosopher who brought the dialectical method to a new pinnacle of development. According to Hegel in Science of Logic, the dialectical methods consists of three steps. First, a thesis is given, which can be any proposition in logic. Second, the antithesis of the thesis is formed and, finally, a synthesis incorporating both thesis and antithesis. Hegel believed that no proposition taken by itself can be completely true. Only the whole can be true, and the dialectical synthesis was the means by which the whole could be examined in relation to a specific proposition. Truth consists of the whole process. Separating out thesis, antithesis, or synthesis as a stand-alone statement results in something that is in some way or other untrue. The concept of \\"nothing\\" arises in Hegel right at the beginning of his Logic. The whole is called by Hegel the \\"Absolute\\" and is to be viewed as something spiritual. Hegel then has:Russell, pp. 701‚Äì704. * Thesis: the absolute is pure being * Antithesis: the absolute is nothing * Synthesis: the absolute is becoming Existentialists The most prominent figure among the existentialists is Jean-Paul Sartre, whose ideas in his book Being and Nothingness (L'√™tre et le n√©ant) are heavily influenced by Being and Time (Sein und Zeit) of Martin Heidegger, although Heidegger later stated that he was misunderstood by Sartre.Heidegger, \\"Letter on 'Humanism'\\", Pathmarks (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 250‚Äì251. Sartre defines two kinds of \\"being\\" (√™tre). One kind is √™tre-en-soi, the brute existence of things such as a tree. The other kind is √™tre-pour-soi which is consciousness. Sartre claims that this second kind of being is \\"nothing\\" since consciousness cannot be an object of consciousness and can possess no essence.Robert C. Solomon, From Hegel to Existentialism, pp. 286‚Äì287, Oxford University Press US, 1989, . Sartre, and even more so, Jaques Lacan, use this conception of nothing as the foundation of their atheist philosophy. Equating nothingness with being leads to creation from nothing and hence God is no longer needed for there to be existence.Conor Cunningham, A Genealogy of Nihilism: Philosophies of Nothing and the Difference of Theology, pp. 251‚Äì255, Routledge, 2002 . =Eastern philosophy= The understanding of 'nothing' varies widely between cultures, especially between Western and Eastern cultures and philosophical traditions. For instance, ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ (emptiness), unlike \\"nothingness\\", is considered to be a state of mind in some forms of Buddhism (see Nirvana, mu, and Bodhi). Achieving 'nothing' as a state of mind in this tradition allows one to be totally focused on a thought or activity at a level of intensity that they would not be able to achieve if they were consciously thinking. A classic example of this is an archer attempting to erase the mind and clear the thoughts to better focus on the shot. Some authors have pointed to similarities between the Buddhist conception of nothingness and the ideas of Martin Heidegger and existentialists like Sartre,Steven William Laycock, Nothingness and Emptiness: A Buddhist Engagement with the Ontology of Jean-Paul Sartre, SUNY Press, 2001 .Charles B. Guignon, The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger, pp. 293‚Äì325, Cambridge University Press, 2006 . although this connection has not been explicitly made by the philosophers themselves. In some Eastern philosophies, the concept of \\"nothingness\\" is characterized by an egoless state of being in which one fully realizes one's own small part in the cosmos. The Kyoto School handles the concept of nothingness as well. Computing In computing, \\"nothing\\" can be a keyword (in VB.Net) used in place of something unassigned, a data abstraction. Although a computer's storage hardware always contains numbers, \\"nothing\\" symbolizes a number skipped by the system when the programmer desires. Many systems have similar capabilities but different keywords, such as \\"null\\" (e.g. SQL), \\"NUL\\", \\"nil\\", and \\"None\\" (Python). To instruct a computer processor to do nothing, a keyword such as \\"NOP\\" may be available. This is a control abstraction; a processor that executes NOP will behave identically to a processor that does not process this directive.NOP ‚Äì ARM Software Developer Toolkit Reference Guide.

Having taught himself the trumpet at school, Lyttelton became a professional musician, leading his own eight-piece band, which recorded a hit single, \\"Bad Penny Blues\\", in 1956. As a broadcaster, he presented BBC Radio 2's The Best of Jazz for forty years, and hosted the comedy panel game I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue on Radio 4, becoming the UK's oldest panel game host. Lyttelton was also a cartoonist, collaborating on the long-running Flook series in the Daily Mail, and a calligrapher and president of The Society for Italic Handwriting. Early life and career Lyttelton was born at Eton College, (then in Buckinghamshire), where his father, George William Lyttelton (second son of the 8th Viscount Cobham), was a house master. (As a male-line descendant of Charles Lyttelton, Lyttelton was in remainder to both the Viscountcy Cobham and the Barony of Lyttelton.) From Sunningdale Preparatory School, Lyttelton duly progressed to Eton College. He was a cousin of the 10th Viscount Cobham and a great-nephew of the politician and sportsman Alfred Lyttelton, the first man to represent England at both football and cricket, both of whom also attended Eton. At Eton, Lyttelton fagged for Lord Carrington and formed his love of jazz. He was inspired by the trumpeters Louis Armstrong (who subsequently referred to Lyttelton as \\"that cat in England who swings his ass off\\")Obituary: Humphrey Lyttelton at BBC.co.uk; published April 25, 2008; retrieved August 13, 2014 and Nat Gonella. He taught himself the instrument, and formed a quartet at the school in 1936 that included the future journalist Ludovic Kennedy on drums. After leaving school, Lyttelton spent some time at the Port Talbot steel plate works in South Wales, an experience which led to his becoming what he termed a \\"romantic socialist\\". After being called up for war service, he was commissioned in the Grenadier Guards as a second lieutenant on 29 November 1941 alongside future politician Mark Bonham Carter, and saw action at Salerno, Italy, during Operation Avalanche, when he came ashore with his pistol in one hand, and his trumpet in the other. On VE Day, 8 May 1945, Lyttelton joined in the celebrations by playing his trumpet from a wheelbarrow, inadvertently giving his first broadcast performance; the BBC recording still survives. Following demobilisation after World War II, he attended Camberwell Art College for two years. In 1949, he joined the Daily Mail as a cartoonist, where he remained until 1956. He was one of the collaborators with Wally Fawkes on the long- running cartoon strip Flook. The jazzman Lyttelton received a grant for further study. He went to Camberwell School of Art, where he met Wally Fawkes, a fellow jazz enthusiast and clarinet-player, also known as the cartoonist \\"Trog\\". In 1949, Fawkes helped him to get a job with the Daily Mail writing the words for Flook, Fawkes's comic strip. They had both joined the George Webb Dixielanders in 1947. Webb was an important catalyst in the British postwar jazz boom. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Lyttelton was prominent in the British revival of traditional jazz forms from New Orleans, recording with Sidney Bechet in 1949. To do so he had to break with the Musicians' Union restrictive practices which forbade working with jazz musicians from the United States. In 1956, he had his only pop chart hit, with the Joe Meek- produced recording of \\"Bad Penny Blues\\", which was in the UK Singles Chart for six weeks. Over time, Lyttelton gradually shifted to a more mainstream approach favoured by American musicians such as trumpeter Buck Clayton. By 1953 he had begun to add saxophonists to the lineup. On one occasion in that year, the development did not meet with the approval of his fans. At a Birmingham Town Hall concert at which alto saxophonist Bruce Turner debuted, a banner with the words \\"Go Home Dirty Bopper!\\" was prominently unfolded. Occasionally, with the help of Eddie Harvey, he assembled a big band for BBC broadcasts and records. In 1957 and 1958 blues singer Jimmy Rushing toured England with the band, as did Clayton, Vic Dickenson and Big Joe Turner in 1965. Clayton recorded with Lyttelton in the early 1960s and toured with the band on numerous occasions. Clayton considered himself and Lyttelton to be brothers. He also recorded with visiting Americans Al Casey, Buddy Tate, and Kenny Davern. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1958 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. By now his repertoire had expanded, including not only lesser known Duke Ellington pieces, but even \\"The Champ\\" from Dizzy Gillespie's band book. The Lyttelton band ‚Äî he saw himself primarily as a leader ‚Äî helped develop the careers of many now prominent British musicians, including Tony Coe and Alan Barnes. In 1983, Lyttelton formed Calligraph Records, which reissued some of his old recordings, all future recordings by his band, and recordings by band members. On 11 March 2008, he announced that he would cease presenting BBC Radio 2's Best of Jazz. On 23 July 2008, Lyttelton was posthumously named BBC Radio 2 Jazz Artist of the Year, voted by radio listeners. Humphrey Lyttelton Band For several years during the postwar period at 100 Oxford Street his regular band included Wally Fawkes, the Christie brothers, Pat Hawes and Johnny Parker. From 1958, Lyttelton's favoured line up was an eight‚Äìpiece band with three saxophones, (alto, tenor and baritone) although this was reduced to seven occasionally to save money. But he would sometimes add the baritone again for broadcasts and recordings. Lyttelton's mainstream band usually included such established musicians as Jimmy Skidmore, Joe Temperley, Kathy Stobart, Jimmy Hastings, Mike McKenzie, John Barnes, Roy Williams and Pete Strange along with new talent such as Tony Coe, Alan Barnes, John Picard, Karen Sharpe, and Jo Fooks. Lyttelton regarded his band as a family, with some members returning to the fold after periods away and/or staying for long periods (Bruce Turner, Stan Greig, Adrian Macintosh, Stobart, Hastings). The band maintained a busy schedule, frequently performing sold-out shows across the country. Performances occasionally included a guest singer, or a collaboration with another band. During the 1990s the band toured with Helen Shapiro in a series of Humph and Helen concerts. They also featured in several Giants of British Jazz tours with Acker Bilk and George Melly and John Chilton's Feetwarmers. Lyttelton had a long established professional relationship with UK singer Elkie Brooks. After working together in the early 1960s they rekindled their working partnership in early 2000 with a series of sold-out and well-received concert performances. In late 2000, they played on the track \\"Life in a Glasshouse\\" on Radiohead's album Amnesiac, released the following year. In 2003, they released the critically acclaimed album Trouble in Mind and continued to perform occasional concerts. Lyttelton introduced American vocalist Stacey Kent to British audiences. Lyttelton's last band featured, apart from himself on trumpet and clarinet: Ray Wordsworth on trombone; Jimmy Hastings on alto sax, clarinet and flute; Jo Fooks on tenor saxophone and flute; Rob Fowler on tenor sax, baritone sax and clarinet; Ted Beament on piano; John Rees-Jones on double bass and Adrian Macintosh on drums. His last formal recordings, one track each on trumpet and clarinet, appeared on his last CD 'Cornucopia 3', (CLG CD 46) all of which he supervised. Trumpet on the other tracks was played by Tony Fisher. He made some recordings as a vocalist. After his death, part of Lyttelton's appearance with his 2007 Band, (with Karen Sharpe instead of Robert Fowler), at the Brecon Jazz Festival, in which he was joined by American tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton was shown by BBCtv as a tribute, (Humph's Last Stand). The band continues to give concerts performing his music. The trumpet part is played by Tony Fisher with occasional guest spots by singer Sue Richardson and ex‚ÄìLytteltonians such as Karen Sharp. Radio personality From 1967 until April 2007, Lyttelton presented The Best of Jazz on BBC Radio 2, a programme that featured his idiosyncratic mix of recordings from all periods of the music's history, including current material. In 2007 he chose to cut his commitment to two quarterly seasons per year, in order to spend more time on other projects. Humphrey Lyttelton and producer Jon Naismith at the 2005 Edinburgh Fringe In 1972 Lyttelton was chosen to host the comedy panel game I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue (ISIHAC) on BBC Radio 4. The show was originally devised as a comedic antidote to traditional BBC panel games (both radio and television), which had come to be seen as dull and formulaic, and in keeping with the staid middle-class \\"Auntie Beeb\\" image. Lyttelton continued in this role until shortly before he died, and was known for both his deadpan, disgruntled, and occasionally bewildered style of chairmanship, and for his near-the-knuckle doubles entendres and innuendo which, despite always being open to an innocent interpretation, was, according to William Rushton, \\"the filthiest thing on radio\\". The programme's success had considerable influence on the manner in which comedy was presented on radio, and Lyttelton's persona was a significant part of that success: he was a straight man surrounded by mayhem. At the time of his death, Lyttelton was the oldest active panel game host in the UK, being two and a half years older than his closest rival, Nicholas Parsons. As well as his other activities, Lyttelton was a keen calligrapher and President of The Society for Italic Handwriting. He named his own record label \\"Calligraph\\" after this extracurricular interest. This label, founded in the early 1980s, not only issues his own albums and those of associates, but also re-issues (on CD) his analogue recordings for the Parlophone label in the 1950s. He is reported to have turned down a knighthood in 1995. Personal life Lyttelton was married twice. His first wife was Patricia Mary (Pat) Braithwaite (born 1929), whom he married on 19 August 1948. They had one daughter, Henrietta (born 1949). In 1952, following his divorce, he married (Elizabeth) Jill Richardson (1933‚Äì2006), with whom he had two sons and a daughter, Stephen (born 1955) and David (born 1958), and Georgina (born 1963). Despite his celebrity, he was intensely private. He designed his house in Arkley, Hertfordshire, with blank walls on the outside and the windows opening onto an internal courtyard. He hated using the telephone and kept his number ex-directory, changing it if anybody else discovered it. Given his dislike of the telephone, he communicated by post, including letters hiring and firing members of his band. He twice refused state honours which were offered to him. One occasion was in 1976, and in 1994 he declined the knighthood offered by Downing Street: his son Stephen later wrote that \\"Accepting it was never an option but he still felt sick to the stomach. He kept it from all of us, especially my mother who would have exerted a lot of pressure on him to accept, seeing it as recognition for all his work.\\" Illness and death On 18 April 2008, Jon Naismith, the producer of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, announced cancellation of the spring series owing to Humphrey Lyttelton's hospitalisation to repair an aortic aneurysm. Rob Brydon and others were asked to deputise for Lyttelton during the tour shows, but Lyttelton postponed his operation and managed to perform on all but the last night. A further email on 21 April 2008 reported that the BBC were \\"unclear precisely how long Humph's recovery period will be\\" but Lyttelton was \\"otherwise fine and in very good spirits\\". On 22 April 2008, Lyttelton and the I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue team were booked to appear in the stage version of the programme at the Pavilion Theatre, Bournemouth. Because of his illness, his place was taken by Rob Brydon, but a pre-recorded message from Lyttelton was played to the audience (\\"I'm sorry I can't be with you today as I am in hospital ‚Äî I wish I'd thought of this sooner!\\"). The panellists on that night were Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, Barry Cryer and Jeremy Hardy. Lyttelton died peacefully following his surgery on 25 April 2008 with his family around him. As soon as news of his death became known, members of the public, apparently spontaneously, began leaving flowers at Mornington Crescent station. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 1995 episode of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue as a tribute on Sunday 27 April, and a retrospective programme presented by Kenneth Clarke on Wednesday 30 April 2008. Radio 4 celebrated Humphrey Lyttelton Day on Sunday 15 June 2008, including a new profile of ISIHAC by Stephen Fry called Chairman Humph ‚Äî A Tribute. After his death, the controller of Radio 4, Mark Damazer, said: \\"He's just a colossally good broadcaster and possessed of this fantastic sense of timing. [...] It's a very, very sad day but we should celebrate and be very grateful for how much he did for Radio 4, really terrific.\\" Responding to news of Lyttelton's death, Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood wrote on the band's website: \\"We were all sorry to hear of Humphrey Lyttelton's death ‚Äî he was an inspiring person to record with, and without his direction, we'd never have recorded/released \\"Life in a Glasshouse\\". So go and find \\"Bad Penny Blues\\", and celebrate his life with some hot jazz.\\" Lyttelton is survived by his four children: a daughter from his first marriage to Pat Braithwaite, and two sons and a daughter from his second marriage to Jill Richardson. Richardson, to whom he had been married since 1952, predeceased him in 2006. His Humanist funeral took place on 6 May 2008 at the St Marylebone Crematorium (which shares grounds with East Finchley Cemetery) in East Finchley, north London. Lyttelton regarded himself as a Humanist. On 25 April 2010, two years after Lyttelton's death, a celebratory concert entitled \\"Humphrey Lyttelton ‚Äî A Celebration Concert\\" was held at the Hammersmith Apollo to celebrate his life, works and contribution to music. Singer Elkie Brooks and many prominent British jazz musicians appeared at the concert, along with panellists from I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. The event was organised and hosted by his son Stephen Lyttelton, who is also the founder and Chairman of The Humph Trust, an organisation set up after his death to support young up and coming jazz musicians and to provide sponsorship and support. The event was opened by the 2010 winner of the Humphrey Lyttelton Royal Academy Of Music Jazz Award, Tom Walsh, who played Horace Silver's \\"Song for my Father\\" with his quintet from the Royal Academy of Music. The Lyttelton Arms pub, opposite Mornington Crescent station in Camden, is named after Lyttelton. It was formerly named The Southampton Arms.

It is found in the coast ranges of California and the Sierra Nevada foothills, from Siskiyou County to Santa Barbara and Madera Counties. Trillium chloropetalum is a perennial herbaceous plant that blooms from late February to early or mid April. The petal color is variable, from dark red to white. Like other Trillium species the leaves and flowers are grouped in threes. It is clump-forming and prefers a shady woodland habitat. Taxonomy Two infraspecific names are accepted: * Trillium chloropetalum var. chloropetalum * Trillium chloropetalum var. giganteum (Hook. & Arn.) Munz The petals of T. chloropetalum var. chloropetalum always show yellow pigments, which are often masked with purple or other pigments. In contrast, the petals of T. chloropetalum var. giganteum lack yellow pigments. The latter variety, with its deep maroon flower petals, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. In the San Francisco Bay Area, a white-petaled form of T. chloropetalum var. giganteum is often confused with T. albidum, which also has white petals. The former is distinguished by the purple pigment in its anthers, a character lacking in T. albidum.

( , ; ‚Äì August 18, 472) was a Romanized Germanic general who effectively ruled the remaining territory of the Western Roman Empire from 461 until his death in 472, with a brief interlude in which he contested power with Anthemius. Deriving his power from his position as magister militum of the Western Empire, Ricimer exercised political control through a series of puppet emperors. Ricimer's military office and his dominance over the empire led historians such as J. B. Bury to conclude that he was a link between previous magistri militum, such as the Vandal Stilicho, and the Germanic King of Italy, Odoacer.J. B. Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire (London: Macmillan, 1889), vol. 1 p. 241 Odoacer deposed the Western Emperor Romulus Augustulus in 476, in an act often considered to mark the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Lineage The date of Ricimer's birth is unknown. Some scholars have dated it as late as the early 430s, which would have made him unusually young when he rose to power. A birthdate of around 418 is more likely. The names of his parents are also unknown. In his panegyric to Anthemius, given in 468, the poet Sidonius Apollinaris claimed that Ricimer was Suevic on his father's side and Visigothic on his mother's, specifying that his maternal grandfather was Wallia, King of the Visigoths, who died in 418. It has been suggested that his Suevic father may have been a son of Hermeric, the king of the Suevi around 418, or else possibly Hermegarius, a Suevic war leader who died in 429.Andrew Gillett, \\"The Birth of Ricimer\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 44, 3 (1995), pp. 380‚Äì84. It has been surmised that Ricimer was the offspring of a marriage alliance between the ruling Suevic and Gothic houses. Such an alliance has been suggested as occurring in the year 431, but a more likely date is anterior to Wallia's death in 418. Wallia's successors as leader of the Visigoths were not his close relatives and may have become hostile toward the family members of the deceased king. As entry into the Western Empire's military was a frequent option for \\"losers of struggles for leadership among the barbarians\\", Ricimer's family may have entered the service of Rome.Sister: Herwig Wolfram, History of the Goths, (1979) 1988:33, following Martindale, Prosopography, 2:524f; daughter: Wolfram 1988:202. Ricimer's younger sister later married Gondioc, the king of the Burgundians. Rise to power According to Sidonius Apollinaris, Ricimer served under the magister militum Flavius Aetius alongside the comes domesticorum Majorian, whom he befriended.Sidonius, Carmen V, 266-268; translated by W. B. Anderson, Sidonius: Poems and Letters (Harvard: Loeb Classical Library, 1980), vol. 1 p. 83 A power vacuum was created in the Western Empire after the events of 454 and 455, which saw the consecutive murders of Aetius and of the Western Emperor Valentinian III, who had been responsible for the magister militum's assassination. After the assassinations, the Roman Senator Petronius Maximus proclaimed himself emperor. Petronius, however, was killed by a Roman mob immediately prior to the Vandal sacking of the city in 455. After the sack, the Visigothic King Theodoric II proclaimed as Emperor Avitus, the Roman military commander in Gaul. In return for Theodoric's support, Avitus agreed to allow the Visigoths to enter Suevi-controlled Hispania. Theodoric consented to Avitus's offers and the new emperor, with the Visigoths under his command, marched on Rome to secure the throne. Avitus named the Visigoth Remistus as magister militum, a position which had been vacant since Aetius's death. Following the arrival of Avitus in Rome, Majorian gave his support, albeit reluctantly, to the new emperor. Avitus subsequently appointed Ricimer as a comes, or count of the empire, a prominent military position. By this point, however, the Western Empire encompassed only the Italian Peninsula and portions of southern Gaul, a mere fraction of the territory held by Rome in previous centuries. Ricimer raised an army and navy from the Germanic mercenaries available to him, and commenced campaigns directed against \\"barbarian\\" tribes in conflict with the empire. Ricimer achieved his first important victory in 456, when he defeated the Vandals in the Battle of Agrigentum and the Battle of Corsica. Although Priscus wrote that Avitus had sent him to Sicily to engage the Vandals, Hydatius states he defeated the Vandals near Corsica.Priscus, fragment 24; translated by C.D. Gordon, The Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), p. 115. Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, vol. 1 p. 236 After his Mediterranean victory, Ricimer was appointed by Avitus as magister militum praesentalis, the commander of the Western Empire's field army in Italy and effectively the second-highest rank available to a general of the West. Ricimer used his new position to assist his colleague Majorian in plotting against Avitus, who had not yet been recognized as Emperor of the West by Marcian, the Eastern Emperor. Ricimer and Majorian convinced the Roman Senate to authorize a military expedition against Avitus, who had established himself at the imperial capital of Ravenna. The two led an army against an imperial force commanded by the magister militum Remistus and defeated it at Piacenza on October 16, 456. They then besieged Avitus in Ravenna, which fell. Avitus was captured, forced to assume the bishopric of Piacenza, and finally executed.John of Antioch, fragment 202; translated by C.D. Gordon, Age of Attila, p. 116 With the Western throne vacant, the new Eastern Emperor, Leo I, granted Ricimer the title of patrician and the rank of magister militum on February 28, 457. Leo appointed Majorian to replace Ricimer in his Italian command. Without a Western Emperor, Leo hoped to use Ricimer as his effective viceregent in the West. Magister militum =Majorian (457‚Äì461)= As a Germanic tribesman of Arian faith, Ricimer was felt to be ineligible the imperial throne himself, but as magister militum he gained influence over the Germanic peoples occupying Gaul, Hispania, and Northern Africa. He was left with the options of dissolving the Western Empire and ruling as an official viceroy of Leo in Constantinople or exerting his power over the West through a puppet emperor. Though he had hoped to take the first option, the Roman aristocracy refused to consent to this step and Ricimer was forced to take the latter. With a vacant Western throne, the Alamanni invaded Italy. They moved from Raetia and managed to penetrate Italy, reaching Lake Maggiore. Majorian led his field army north to fight the Alamanni, defeating them. Majorian was proclaimed emperor by his troops in a place called ad Columellas on April 1, 457.Sidonius, Carmina; Letters. Translation: Anderson, W.B., Sidonius. Poems and Letters, 2 vols. (Loeb, 1936‚Äì1965) Realizing Majorian's potential as a puppet, Ricimer induced Leo to give his consent to this arrangement. Though Ricimer had expected to control his friend, Majorian proved to be a capable ruler and soon distanced himself from his magister militum. Majorian demonstrated his military skill through his re-conquest of Gaul and his campaigns in Hispania. Majorian's campaigns effectively subdued the Visigoths and returned them to their pre-Avitus foederati status, greatly increasing his standing among the senate and army. Majorian then prepared for a campaign against the Vandals of Genseric. With Majorian in Hispania, Ricimer was left in Italy. Majorian was defeated by Genseric, possibly through treachery, near modern-day Valencia, Spain, while organizing a mercenary army. During his absence, Ricimer convinced the senate to turn against the emperor, who soon disbanded his army and returned to Italy. Learning that the emperor was in Tortona, Ricimer led a detachment there and arrested him. Deposing Majorian on August 3, 461, Ricimer had the emperor tortured and finally beheaded on August 7.Priscus, fragment 27, John of Antioch, fragment 203; both translated by C. D. Gordon, Age of Attila, pp. 116f =Libius Severus (461‚Äì465)= Ricimer's murder of Majorian did not sit well with some portions of the military establishment, especially the commanding general in Gaul, Aegidius, and the commanding general in Dalmatia, Marcellinus, who ruled their respective domains independent from imperial authority. These two generals entered open hostilities with Ricimer and refused to recognize Ricimer's position. Ricimer ruled the West without an emperor for three months. Facing pressure from the senate and Italian aristocracy, Ricimer named the undistinguished Senator Libius Severus as his puppet emperor. Though Severus was recognized by the senate, the Eastern Emperor Leo I refused to recognize him as his Western counterpart. Though he faced open military opposition from Western generals, with the docile Severus as emperor, Ricimer was master of Rome. The principal problems facing Ricimer during Severus' \\"reign\\" were military opposition from the Vandals and political opposition from the Eastern Empire. The Vandals had continuously raided the Italian coast since the assassination of Valentinian III in 455, wreaking havoc upon the Italian economy. At the same time, because Leo did not recognize Severus as Western Emperor, he refused to provide assistance to the Western government. Constantinople had made peace with Genseric in 462, but had refused to intervene in the Vandal raids. Due to diminished tax revenues and with the key armies of the West under opposition control, Ricimer needed assistance from the East in order to maintain order in the West. As such, Severus, despite his docile nature, represented an obstacle to Ricimer's power. Upon Severus' death in 465‚Äîrumored, according to Cassiodorus, to have been poisoned by RicimerCassiodrus, Chronicle, 1280, quoted in Oost, \\"D. N. Libivs Severvs P. F. AVGA\\", Classical Philology, 65 (1970), p. 229‚ÄîRicimer proceeded to rule the West for eighteen months without an emperor as he waited for Leo to name Severus' successor. =Anthemius (467‚Äì472)= The Vandals saw the vacant Western throne as an opportunity to influence imperial politics. Genseric supported Olybrius' candidacy for emperor. Genseric had family ties with Olybrius as both Olybrius and Genseric's son Huneric had married the two daughters of Valentinian III. With Olybrius on the throne, Genseric would become the real power behind the throne in the West, replacing Ricimer. The Vandals extended their attacks on Sicily and Italy to the territories of the Eastern Empire to put Leo under pressure. They started sacking and enslaving people living in Illyricum, the Peloponnese and other parts of Greece. In 467 Leo, faced with increased Vandal impingement, named Anthemius, the commanding general of the Illyrian Army, as Western Emperor. Leo sent Anthemius to Italy with an army led by the commanding general of the Dalmatian Army, Marcellinus, who had previously rebelled against Ricimer. Anthemius was to secure the Western throne and recapture North Africa from the Vandals. Ricimer must have initially viewed Anthemius' appointment as undermining his position. Unlike Libius Severus, Anthemius had a proven history of military success and had family ties to the Theodosian Dynasty. However, needing the support of the Eastern Empire, Ricimer was forced to accept him. To solidify his connections with the new emperor, Ricimer diplomatically married Anthemius' daughter Alypia,Ralph W. Mathisen, \\"Anthemius (12 April 467 - 11 July 472 AD.)\\" and for some time lived in peace with Anthemius. Soon after assuming the Western throne, Anthemius granted Marcellinus the rank of patrician in an effort to counterbalance the authority of Ricimer. In the East, it was established practice for there to be two supreme commanders where in the West it had become common to only have one. With his experience with the Eastern military structure, this may have been an attempt by Anthemius to introduce the Eastern structure and rule like an Eastern Emperor using the successful and trustworthy Marcellinus as supreme co-commander with Ricimer. Both Leo and Anthemius had seen the difficulty Western Emperors had in maintaining control over the Western military with the existence of a single unchallenged supreme commander. In 468, Leo organized a grand campaign against the Vandals in North Africa, to which the East and West would commit substantial forces. The commanding general of the Thracian Army, Basiliscus, brother-in-law of Leo, assumed supreme command over the joint East-West assault, with Marcellinus commanding the Western forces. The plan called for a three-pronged attack led by Basiliscus, Marcellinus, and Heraclius of Edessa, the comes militaris (Military Count) of Egypt.Hussey (1967), p. 426 Basiliscus was to land at a distance from Carthage with the main army (transported by an armada of over 1,000 ships) and then link up with Heraclius, advancing from Tripolitania. Marcellinus was to secure Sicily and Sardinia and then sail on to Carthage.Stephen Williams and Gerard Friell, The Rome That Did Not Fall: Survival of the East in the fifth century, pp 178 Ricimer, under the overall command of Marcellinus, commanded a large portion of the Western forces in the expedition. Ricimer's behavior raised suspicions that he secretly wanted the expedition to fail, which it ultimately did following the disastrous Battle of Cape Bon. Most of the joint armada was destroyed, with Marcellinus himself being assassinated by his own soldiers while in Sicily, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer. The failed joint expedition against the Vandals bankrupted the Western and Eastern Empires and greatly reduced their military might. Upon hearing of the disastrous defeat, the Visigoths resumed their wars of expansion against the West and the Vandals resumed raids on Italy. Additionally, with Marcellinus dead, Ricimer was left as the sole Supreme Commander of the West. Marcellinus had been Anthemius' favorite of the two generals, and his death served to widen the divide between the emperor and Ricimer. The tipping point of their relationship was the trial of Romanus, the imperial chancellor (magister officiorum) and supporter of Ricimer, whom Anthemius accused of treachery and condemned to death in 470.Cassiodorus, Chronicon, 1289; Paul the Deacon, Historia Romana, xv.2; John of Antioch, fragments 209.1‚Äì2, 207, translated by C.D. Gordon, The Age of Attila (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), pp. 122f Following the execution of Romanus by Anthemius, Ricimer moved north to Mediolanum with a force of several thousand soldiers. Relations between the two deteriorated to the point that Epiphanius of Pavia, bishop of Milan, was asked to negotiate peace between them.Related in Ennodius, Vita Epifanius, 51-75; translated in Sr. Genevieve Marie Cook, The Life of Saint Epiphanius by Ennodius: A translation with an introduction and commentary (Washington: Catholic University of America, 1942), pp. 53-63. Despite the bishop's efforts, open warfare broke out between Ricimer and Anthemius again in 472. Ricimer, along with his barbarian mercenary units (including the soldiers of Odoacer), marched on Rome. Besieged, Anthemius took refuge in St. Peter's Basilica. Leo dispatched Olybrius to mediate a truce between Ricimer and Anthemius but, according to John Malalas, had sent a secret letter to Anthemius, urging him to kill Olybrius. Ricimer intercepted the letter, showed it to Olybrius, and had him proclaimed emperor.John Malalas, Chronographica, 373‚Äì374. The siege lasted for five months. Ricimer finally entered the city and succeeded in separating the port on the Tiber from the Palatine, starving the supporters of the emperor.John of Antioch, fragment 209.1‚Äì2; translated by C.D. Gordon, The Age of Attila, pp. 122f Both sides appealed to the field army in Gaul, but the Burgundian commanding general of Gaul, Gundobad, supported his uncle Ricimer. Anthemius held out until his supporters deserted him. Disguised as a beggar, the emperor was caught attempting to flee the city at the Church of Santa Maria in Trastevere, where he was beheaded on July 11, 472.John of Antioch, fragment 209, translated by C.D Gordon, Age of Attila, pp. 122f Ricimer then proclaimed Olybrius as emperor, who was the candidate for emperor that he and Genseric had once favored. Death Ricimer's rule lasted until his death from a hemorrhage on August 18, 472, six weeks after deposing Anthemius. His title of patrician and position as supreme commander were assumed by his nephew Gundobad. Without a powerful figure to guide it, the Western Roman Empire experienced an even more rapid succession of emperors, none of whom were able to effectively consolidate power. The line of Western Roman Emperors ended arguably in either 476 (with Odoacer's deposition of Romulus Augustulus) or 480 (with Julius Nepos's death), concentrating the remaining imperial power in far-off Constantinople. Appearances in opera Ricimer's life was used as a subject of opera libretti in the 17th and 18th centuries, embellishing his biography with romantic and political intrigues. The earliest setting was Matteo Noris's Ricimero re de' Vandali (set by Carlo Pallavicino, 1684), which focuses on the installation of Anthemius in Rome and the promise of marriage to his daughter Domizia. A better-known setting was Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati's libretto Flavio Anicio Olibrio, set by Francesco Gasparini (1708), Nicola Porpora (1711), Leonardo Vinci (1728), and Niccol√≤ Jommelli (1740). This libretto is based on Ricimer's siege of Rome and his relationship with Olybrius and their loves.

It has produced a literary genre which is variously called alternate history, speculative history, or hypothetical history. One goal is to estimate the relative importance of a specific event, incident or person. For instance, to the counterfactual claim \\"What would have happened had Hitler drunk coffee instead of tea on the afternoon he committed suicide?\\", the timeline would have remained unchanged‚ÄîHitler in all likelihood still would have committed suicide on April 30, 1945, regardless of what he had to drink that afternoon. However, to the counterfactual \\"What would have happened had Hitler died in the July 1944 assassination attempt?\\", all sorts of possibilities become readily apparent, starting with the assumption that the German generals, had they been able to consolidate power over remaining Nazi functionaries such as Goebbels and Himmler, would probably have sued for peace, bringing an early end to World War II. (Historians generally feel popular support for the Party was still very strong in July 1944, and the party apparatus of Himmler, Goebbels, Speer, Bormann, G√∂ring etc. would survive even an assassination of Hitler.) Thus, the counterfactual brings into sharp relief the question of how important Hitler was as an individual and how his personal fate shaped the course of the war and, ultimately, of world history. Development Although there are Victorian examples of counterfactual history, it was not until the very late 20th century that the major interest for exploration of counterfactuals in history began. An early example is If It Had Happened Otherwise (1931) which features a contribution by Winston Churchill who examined what would have happened had Robert E. Lee won at the Battle of Gettysburg. Although this volume is notable for featuring imagined histories by serious historians, the histories are presented in narrative form (in most cases with a fairly whimsical tone) without any analysis of the reasoning behind these scenarios, so they fall short of modern standards for serious counterfactual history and are closer to the fictional alternate history genre. A significant foray into treating counterfactual scenarios seriously was made by the economic historian Robert Fogel. In his 1964 book Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History, Fogel tried to use quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 had there been no railroads.Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History ‚Äì Book Reviews Fogel hypothesizes that, in the absence of the railroad, America‚Äôs large canal system would have been expanded and its roads would have been improved through pavement; both of these improvements would take away from the social impact of the railroad. He estimates that ‚Äúthe level of per capita income achieved by January 1, 1890 would have been reached by March 31, 1890, if railroads had never been invented.‚Äù Few further attempts to bring counterfactual history into the world of academia were made until the 1991 publication of Plausible Worlds: Possibility and Understanding in History and the Social Sciences by the Cambridge sociologist Geoffrey Hawthorn, who carefully explored three different counterfactual scenarios. This work helped inspire Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian Niall Ferguson. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as Marxism, and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of \\"What If?\\" books edited by Robert Cowley presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about \\"how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time.\\" Some scholars argue that a counterfactual is not as much a matter of what happened in the past but it is the disagreement about which past events were most significant. For example, William Thompson employs a sequence of counterfactuals for eight lead economies that have driven globalization processes for almost a thousand years. From Song dynasty in China to Genoa, Venice, Portugal, the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, and claims that each actor in succession played an unusually critical role in creating a structure of leadership that became increasingly global in scope across time.Thompson. W. The Lead Economy Sequence in World Politics (From Sung China to the United States): Selected Counterfactuals. Journal of Globalization Studies. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2010. pp. 6‚Äì28 =Differences from alternate history= Counterfactual history is neither historical revisionism nor alternate history. Counterfactual history distinguishes itself through its interest in the very incident that is being negated by the counterfactual, thus seeking to evaluate the event's relative historical importance. Such historians reason arguments for each change, outlining changes in broad terms only, as befits a mere byproduct of the exercise. An alternate history writer, on the other hand, is interested precisely in the hypothetical scenarios that flow from the negated incident or event. A fiction writer is thus free to invent very specific events and characters in the imagined history. The line is sometimes blurred as historians may invent more detailed timelines as illustrations of their ideas about the types of changes that might have occurred. But it is usually clear what general types of consequences the author thinks are reasonable to suppose would have been likely to occur, and what specific details are included in an imagined timeline only for illustrative purposes. The line is further blurred by novelists such as Kim Stanley Robinson, whose alternate-history novel The Years of Rice and Salt has a character talking of historians' use of counterfactuals, within the novel's alternate history. He dismisses this as \\"a useless exercise\\". Criticism Most historians regard counterfactual history as perhaps entertaining, but not meeting the standards of mainstream historical research due to its speculative nature. Advocates of counterfactual history often respond that all statements about causality in history contain implicit counterfactual claims‚Äîfor example, the claim that a certain military decision helped a country win a war presumes that if that decision had not been made, the war would have been less likely to be won, or would have been longer. Since counterfactual history is such a recent development, a serious, systematic critique of its uses and methodologies has yet to be made, as the movement itself is still working out those methods and frameworks. Aviezer Tucker has offered a range of criticism of this approach to the study of the past both in his review of Ferguson's Virtual History in History and Theory and in his book Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography, as has Richard J. Evans in his book Altered Pasts. See also * Jonbar hinge * Stalin's Missed Chance * What If? (essays) References Further reading * Bresnahan, James C.

Groud, 2007 Children in the military are children (defined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child as people under the age of 18) who are associated with military organisations, such as state armed forces and non-state armed groups. Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been involved in military campaigns. For example, thousands of children participated on all sides of the First World War and the Second World War.Norman Davies, Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw, Pan Books 2004 p.603 Children may be trained and used for combat, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, or used for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda. Children are easy targets for military recruitment due to their greater susceptibility to influence compared to adults. Some are recruited by force while others choose to join up, often to escape poverty or because they expect military life to offer a rite of passage to maturity. Child recruits who survive armed conflict frequently suffer psychiatric illness, poor literacy and numeracy, and behavioral problems such as heightened aggression, leading to a high risk of poverty and unemployment in adulthood. Research in the UK and US has also found that the enlistment of adolescent children, even when they are not sent to war, is accompanied by a higher risk of attempted suicide, stress-related mental disorders, alcohol abuse, and violent behavior. A number of treaties have sought to curb the participation of children in armed conflicts. According to Child Soldiers International these agreements have helped to reduce child recruitment, but the practice remains widespread and children continue to participate in hostilities around the world. Some economically powerful nations continue to rely on military recruits aged 16 or 17, and the use of younger children in armed conflict has increased in recent years as militant movements and the groups fighting them recruited children in large numbers. History History is filled with children who have been trained and used for fighting, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, used as sex slaves, or recruited for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda. In 1814, for example, Napoleon conscripted many teenagers for his armies.Michael Leggiere, The Fall of Napoleon: The Allied Invasion of France 1813‚Äì1814, pg.99‚Äì100 Thousands of children participated on all sides of the First World War and the Second World War. Children continued to be used throughout the 20th and early 21st century on every continent, with concentrations in parts of Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Only since the turn of the millennium have international efforts begun to limit and reduce the military use of children. Current situation = State armed forces = Since the adoption in 2000 of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC) the global trend has been towards restricting armed forces recruitment to adults aged 18 or over, known as the Straight-18 standard. Most states with armed forces have opted in to OPAC, which also prohibits states that still recruit children from using them in armed conflict. Nonetheless, Child Soldiers International reported in 2018 that children under the age of 18 were still being recruited and trained for military purposes in 46 countries; of these, most recruit from age 17, fewer than 20 recruit from age 16, and an unknown, smaller number, recruit younger children. States that still rely on children to staff their armed forces include the world's three most populous countries (China, India, and the United States) and the most economically powerful (all G7 countries apart from Italy and Japan). The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and others have called for an end to the recruitment of children by state armed forces, arguing that military training, the military environment, and a binding contract of service are not compatible with children's rights and jeopardize healthy development during adolescence. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hired child soldiers from Sudan (especially from Darfur) to fight against Houthis during the Yemeni Civil War (2015‚Äìpresent). = Non-state armed groups = These include non-state armed Paramilitary organisations, using children such as militias, insurgents, terrorist organizations, guerrilla movements, ideologically or religiously- driven groups, armed liberation movements, and other types of quasi-military organisation. In 2017 the United Nations identified 14 countries where children were widely used by such groups: Afghanistan, Colombia, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.http://middleeastinst.libsyn.com/child-soldiers-in-the-middle- east?fbclid=IwAR23lG06WtH794cMztuoTzcLTS5PkdOsw5YCJ0mpj-mllInSNdZNqfqBskI Not all armed groups use children and approximately 60 have entered agreements to reduce or end the practice since 1999. For example, by 2017, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the Philippines had released nearly 2,000 children from its ranks, and in 2016, the FARC-EP guerrilla movement in Colombia agreed to stop recruiting children. Other countries have seen the reverse trend, particularly Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria, where Islamist militants and groups opposing them have intensified their recruitment, training, and use of children. = Global estimate = In 2003 P. W. Singer of the Brookings Institution estimated that child soldiers participate in about three-quarters of ongoing conflicts. In the same year the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) estimated that most of these children were aged over 15, although some were younger. Today, due to the widespread military use of children in areas where armed conflict and insecurity prevent access by UN officials and other third parties, it is difficult to estimate how many children are affected. In 2017 Child Soldiers International estimated that several tens of thousands of children, possibly more than 100,000, were in state- and non-state military organisations around the world, and in 2018 the organisation reported that children were being used to participate in at least 18 armed conflicts. Rationale for the use of children Despite children's physical and psychological underdevelopment relative to adults, there are many reasons why state- and non-state military organisations seek them out. Cited examples include: * Peter W. Singer has suggested that the global proliferation of light automatic weapons, which children can easily handle, has made the use of children as direct combatants more viable. * Rom√©o Dallaire has pointed to the role of overpopulation in making children a cheap and accessible resource for military organisations. *Roger Rosenblatt has suggested that children are more willing than adults to fight for non-monetary incentives such as religion, honour, prestige, revenge and duty. * Several commentators, including Bernd Beber, Christopher Blattman, Dave Grossman, Michael Wessels, and McGurk and colleagues, have argued that since children are more obedient and malleable than adults, they are easier to control, deceive and indoctrinate. * David Gee and Rachel Taylor have found that in the UK, the army finds it easier to attract child recruits starting from age 16 than adults from age 18, particularly those from poorer backgrounds. * Some leaders of armed groups have claimed that children, despite their underdevelopment, bring their own qualities as combatants to a fighting unit, often being remarkably fearless, agile and hardy. While some children are forcibly recruited, deceived, or bribed into joining military organisations, others join of their own volition. There are many reasons for this. In a 2004 study of children in military organisations around the world, Rachel Brett and Irma Specht pointed to a complex of factors that incentivise enlisting, particularly: * Background poverty including a lack of civilian education or employment opportunities * The cultural normalization of war * Seeking new friends * Revenge (for example, after seeing friends and relatives killed) * Expectations that a \\"warrior\\" role provides a rite of passage to maturity The following testimony from a child recruited by the Cambodian armed forces in the 1990s is typical of many children's motivations for joining up: > I joined because my parents lacked food and I had no school... I was worried > about mines but what can we do‚Äîit's an order [to go to the front line]. Once > somebody stepped on a mine in front of me‚Äîhe was wounded and died... I was > with the radio at the time, about 60 metres away. I was sitting in my > hammock and saw him die... I see young children in every unit... I'm sure > I'll be a soldier for at least a couple of more years. If I stop being a > soldier I won't have a job to do because I don't have any skills. I don't > know what I'll do...  Impact on children  The scale of the impact on children was first acknowledged by the international community in a major report commissioned by the UN General Assembly, Impact of Armed Conflict on Children (1996), which was produced by the human rights expert Gra√ßa Machel. The report was particularly concerned with the use of younger children, presenting evidence that many thousands of children were being killed, maimed, and psychiatrically injured around the world every year. Since the Machel Report further research has shown that child recruits who survive armed conflict face a markedly elevated risk of debilitating psychiatric illness, poor literacy and numeracy, and behavioural problems. Research in Palestine and Uganda, for example, has found that more than half of former child soldiers showed symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder and nearly nine in ten in Uganda screened positive for depressed mood. Researchers in Palestine also found that children exposed to high levels of violence in armed conflict were substantially more likely than other children to exhibit aggression and anti-social behaviour. The combined impact of these effects typically includes a high risk of poverty and lasting unemployment in adulthood. Further harm is caused when child recruits are detained by armed forces and groups, according to Human Rights Watch. Children are often detained without sufficient food, medical care, or under other inhumane conditions, and some experience physical and sexual torture. Some are captured with their families, or detained due to the activity of one of their family members. Lawyers and relatives are frequently banned from any court hearing. Other research has found that the enlistment of children, including older children, has a detrimental impact even when they are not used in armed conflict until they reach adulthood. Military academics in the US have characterized military training (at all ages) as \\"intense indoctrination\\" in conditions of sustained stress, the primary purpose of which is to establish the unconditional and immediate obedience of recruits. The academic literature has found that adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to a high-stress environment, such as that of initial military training, particularly those from a background of childhood adversity. Enlistment, even before recruits are sent to war, is accompanied by a higher risk of attempted suicide in the US, higher risk of mental disorders in the US and the UK, higher risk of alcohol misuse and higher risk of violent behaviour, relative to recruits' pre-enlistment background. Military settings are also characterised by elevated rates of bullying and sexual harassment. Military recruitment practices have also been found to exploit the vulnerabilities of children in mid-adolescence. Specifically, evidence from Germany, the UK and the US has shown that recruiters disproportionately target children from poorer backgrounds using marketing that omits the risks and restrictions of military life. Some academics have argued that marketing of this kind capitalises on the psychological susceptibility in mid-adolescence to emotionally-driven decision-making. International law = Recruitment and use of children =  Definition of child  The Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as any person under the age of 18. The Paris Principles define a child associated with an armed force or group as: > ...any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used > by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited > to children, boys and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, messengers, > spies or for sexual purposes. The document is approved by the United Nations > General Assembly. It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has > taken a direct part in hostilities.  Children aged under 15  The Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions (1977, Art. 77.2), the convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (2002) all forbid state armed forces and non-state armed groups from using children under the age of 15 directly in armed conflict (technically \\"hostilities\\"). This is now recognised as a war crime.  Children aged under 18  Most states with armed forces are also bound by the higher standards of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC) (2000) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (1999), which forbid the compulsory recruitment of those under the age of 18. OPAC also requires governments that still recruit children (from age 16) to \\"take all feasible measures to ensure that persons below the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities\\". In addition, OPAC forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting children under any circumstances, although the legal force of this is uncertain. The highest standard in the world is set by the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which forbids state armed forces from recruiting children under the age of 18 under any circumstances. Most African states have ratified the Charter.  Limitations and loopholes  States that are not a party to OPAC are subject to the lower standards set by Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which allows armed forces to use children over the age of fifteen in hostilities, and possibly to use younger children who have volunteered as spotters, observers, and message-carriers:ICRC Commentary on Protocol I: Article 77 website of the ICRC ¬∂ 3183‚Äì3191 also ¬∂ 3171 The International Committee of the Red Cross had proposed that the Parties to the conflict should \\"take all necessary measures\\", which became in the final text, \\"take all feasible measures\\", which is not a total prohibition because feasible is understood as meaning \\"capable of being done, accomplished or carried out, possible or practicable\\". During the negotiations over the clause \\"take a part in hostilities\\" the word \\"direct\\" was added to it, opening up the possibility that child volunteers could be involved indirectly in hostilities, such as by gathering and transmitting military information, helping in the transportation of arms and munitions, provision of supplies, etc. However, Article 4.3.c of Protocol II, additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, adopted in 1977, states \\"children who have not attained the age of fifteen years shall neither be recruited in the armed forces or groups nor allowed to take part in hostilities\\". = Standards for the release and reintegration of children = OPAC requires governments to demobilise children within their jurisdiction who have been recruited or used in hostilities and to provide assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration. Under war, civil unrest, armed conflict and other emergency situations, children and youths are also offered protection under the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict. To accommodate the proper disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former members of armed groups, the United Nations started the Integrated DDR Standards in 2006. =War crimes= Opinion is currently divided over whether children should be prosecuted for war crimes.Lauren McCollough, The Military Trial of Omar Khadr: Child Soldiers and the Law , Crimes of War Project 10 March 2008 International law does not prohibit the prosecution of children who commit war crimes, but Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child limits the punishment that a child can receive: \\"Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offenses committed by persons below eighteen years of age.\\"  Example: Sierra Leone  In the wake of the Sierra Leone Civil War, the UN mandated the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) to try former combatants aged 15 and older for breaches of humanitarian law, including war crimes. However, the Paris Principles state that children who participate in armed conflict should be regarded first as victims, even if they may also be perpetrators: This principle was reflected in the Court's statute, which did not rule out prosecution but emphasised the need to rehabilitate and reintegrate former child soldiers. David Crane, the first Chief Prosecutor of the Sierra Leone tribunal, interpreted the statute in favour of prosecuting those who had recruited children, rather than the children themselves, no matter how heinous the crimes they had committed.  Example: Omar Khadr  In the US, prosecutors charged Omar Khadr, a Canadian, for offences they allege he committed in Afghanistan while under the age of 16 and fighting for the Taliban against US forces. These crimes carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment under US law. In 2010, while under torture and duress, Khadr pleaded guilty to murder in violation of the laws of war, attempted murder in violation of the laws of war, conspiracy, two counts of providing material support for terrorism, and spying. The plea was offered as part of a plea bargain, which would see Khadr deported to Canada after one year of imprisonment to serve seven further years there. Omar Khadr remained in Guantanamo Bay and the Canadian government faced international criticism for delaying his repatriation. Khadr was eventually transferred to the Canadian prison system in September 2012 and was freed on bail by a judge in Alberta in May 2015. As of 2016, Khadr was appealing his US conviction as a war criminal. Before sentencing the Special Representative to the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict wrote to the US military commission at Guantanamo appealing unsuccessfully for Khadr's release into a rehabilitation program. In her letter she said that Khadr represented the \\"classic child soldier narrative: recruited by unscrupulous groups to undertake actions at the bidding of adults to fight battles they barely understand\\". The role of the United Nations = Background = Children's rights advocates were left frustrated after the final text of the convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) did not prohibit the military recruitment of all children under the age of 18, and they began to call for a new treaty to achieve this goal. As a consequence the newly formed Committee on the Rights of the Child made two recommendations: first, to request a major UN study into the impact of armed conflict on children; and second, to establish a working group of the UN Commission on Human Rights to negotiate a supplementary protocol to the convention. Both proposals were accepted. Responding to the committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN General Assembly acknowledged \\"the grievous deterioration in the situation of children in many parts of the world as a result of armed conflicts\\" and commissioned the human rights expert Gra√ßa Machel to conduct a major fact-finding study. The Machel Report, Impact of armed conflict on children, was published in 1996. The report noted: > Clearly one of the most urgent priorities is to remove everyone under 18 > years of age from armed forces. Meanwhile, the UN Commission on Human Rights established a working group to negotiate a treaty to raise standards with regard to the use of children for military purposes. After complex negotiations and a global campaign, the new treaty was agreed in 2000 as the Optional Protocol to the convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. The treaty prohibits the direct participation of children in armed conflict, but not their recruitment by state armed forces from age 16. The UN has identified 14 countries where children have been widely used as soldiers. These countries are Afghanistan, Colombia, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The use of child soldiers spans the globe. In an article for the Middle East Institute, the authors Mick Mulroy, Zack Baddorf and Eric Oehlerich, all former military and special operations, state that this issue of child soldiers happens in many locations where the world's superpowers have deployed their own military forces. Therefore, \\"those superpowers have a responsibility to help end this practice of child exploitation\\".https://www.mei.edu/publications/begin-children-child-soldier- numbers-doubled-middle- east-2019?fbclid=IwAR0Fx_gUKvLO4nAsKY9SWSIAcs5-r56XSKyKJX4p8Ye6w-GVj8BTTBXDGSU = Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict = The Machel Report led to a new mandate for a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (SRSG- CAAC). Among the tasks of the SRSG is to draft the Secretary-General's annual report on children and armed conflict, which lists and describes the worst situations of child recruitment and use from around the world. = Security Council = The United Nations Security Council convenes regularly to debate, receive reports, and pass resolutions under the heading \\"Children in armed conflict\\". The first resolution on the issue, Resolution 1261, was passed in 1999. In 2004 Resolution 1539 was passed unanimously, condemning the use of child soldiers and mandating the UN Secretary-General to establish a means of tracking and reporting on the practice, known as the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism. = United Nations Secretary-General = The Secretary-General publishes an annual report on children and armed conflict. The 2017 report identified 14 countries where children were widely used by armed groups during 2016 (Afghanistan, Colombia, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) and six countries where state armed forces were using children in hostilities (Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Syria). In 2011 United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon raised the issue of children in conflict areas who are involved in violent activities according to the Extreme Measures report. Children in the military today‚Äîby region and country This section covers the use of children for military purposes today. For historical cases, see History of children in the military. =Africa= In 2003, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that up to half of children involved with state armed forces and non-state armed groups worldwide were in Africa. In 2004, Child Soldiers International estimated that 100,000 children were being used in state and non-state armed forces on the continent;Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview, Child Soldiers International . and in 2008 an estimate put the total at 120,000 children, or 40 percent of the global total. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (1990), which has been ratified by most African states, prohibits all military recruitment of children aged under 18. Nonetheless, according to the UN, in 2016 children were being used by armed groups in seven African countries (Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan) and by state armed forces in three (Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan). International efforts to reduce the number of children in military organisations in Africa began with the Cape Town Principles and Best Practices, developed in 1997. The Principles proposed that African governments commit to OPAC, which was being negotiated at the time, and raise the minimum age for military recruitment from 15 to 18. The Principles also defined a child soldier to include any person under the age of 18 who is \\"part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or group in any capacity ... including girls recruited for sexual purposes...\\" In 2007, the Free Children from War conference in Paris produced the Paris Principles, which refined and updated the Cape Town Principles, applied them globally, and outlined a practical approach to reintegrating current child soldiers.[1] , UNICEF press release Children of the Omo Valley in Ethiopia Central African Republic The use of children by armed groups in the Central African Republic has historically been common. Between 2012 and 2015 as many as 10,000 children were used by armed groups in the nationwide armed conflict and children were still being used. The mainly Muslim S√©l√©ka coalition of armed groups and the predominantly Christian Anti-balaka militias have both used children in this way; some are as young as eight. In May 2015 at the Forum de Bangui (a meeting of government, parliament, armed groups, civil society, and religious leaders), a number of armed groups agreed to demobilize thousands of children. In 2016 a measure of stability returned to the Central African Republic and, according to the United Nations, 2,691 boys and 1,206 girls were officially separated from armed groups. Despite this, the recruitment and use of children for military purposes increased by approximately 50 percent over that year, mostly attributed to the Lord's Resistance Army. A group of demobilized child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Democratic Republic of the Congo Thousands of children serve in the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as well as in various rebel militias. It has been estimated that at the height of the Second Congo War more than 30,000 children were fighting with various parties to the conflict. It was claimed in the film Kony 2012 that the Lord's Resistance Army recruited this number. Currently the DRC has one of the highest proportions of child soldiers in the world. The international court has passed judgment on these practices during the war. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, one of the warlords in the DRC, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison because of his role in the recruitment of child soldiers between 2002 and 2003. Lubanga directed the Union of Congolese Patriots and its armed wing Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo. The children were forced to fight in the armed conflict in Ituri. Somalia A report published by the Child Soldiers International in 2004 estimated that 200,000 children had been recruited into the country's militias against their will since 1991. In 2017 UN Secretary- General Ant√≥nio Guterres commented on a UN report which estimated that over 50 percent of Al-Shabaab's membership in the country was under the age of 18, with some as young as nine being sent to fight. The report verified that 6,163 children had been recruited in Somalia between 1 April 2010 and 31 July 2016, of which 230 were girls. Al-Shabaab accounted for seventy percent of this recruitment, and the Somali National Army was also recruiting children. Sudan A child soldier of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (2007).In 2004 approximately 17,000 children were being used by the state armed forces and non-state armed groups. As many as 5,000 children were part of the main armed opposite group at the time, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Some former child soldiers were sentenced to death for crimes committed while they were soldiers. In 2006, children were also recruited from refugee camps in Chad, and thousands were used in the conflict in Darfur. In 2005 the government ratified the OPAC treaty and by 2008 the military use of children had reduced in the country, but both state armed forces and the SPLA continued to recruit and use them. The use of children has continued to diminish, but in 2017 the UN was still receiving reports of children as young as 12 in government forces. Zimbabwe In 2003, the Guardian reported multiple human rights violations by the National Youth Service, a state- sponsored youth militia in Zimbabwe. Originally conceived as a patriotic youth organisation, it became a paramilitary group of youth aged between 10 and 30, and was used to suppress dissent in the country. The organisation was finally banned in January 2018. =Americas= Bolivia In 2001 the government of Bolivia acknowledged that children as young as 14 may have been forcibly conscripted into the armed forces during recruitment sweeps.Global March Against Child Labour: Bolivia 2001 About 40% of the Bolivian army was believed to be under the age of 18, with half of those below the age of 16. , Bolivia invites children to begin their adult conscription early, from age 17. Canada In Canada, people may join the reserve component of the Canadian Forces at age 16 with parental permission, and the regular component at 17 years of age, also with parental permission. They may not volunteer for a tour of duty until reaching age 18. Colombia In the Colombian armed conflict, from the mid-1960s to present, one fourth of non-state combatants have been and still are under 18 years old. In 2004 Colombia ranked fourth in the world for the greatest use of child soldiers. There are currently 11,000‚Äì14,000 children in armed groups in the country. In negotiations with the government, armed groups have offered to stop the recruitment of minors as a bargaining chip, but they have not honoured these offers. Bj√∏rkhaug argues that most child soldiers were recruited through some combination of voluntary participation and coercion. In 1998 a Human Rights Watch press release indicated that 30 percent of some guerrilla units were made up of children and up to 85 percent of some of the militias, which are considered to serve as a \\"training ground for future guerrilla fighters\\", had child soldiers In the same press release it was estimated that some of the government-linked paramilitary units consisted of up to 50 percent children, including some as young as 8 years old. In 2005 an estimated 11,000 children were involved with left- or right-wing paramilitaries in Colombia. \\"Approximately 80 percent of child combatants in Colombia belong to one of the two left-wing guerrilla groups, the FARC or ELN. The remainder fight in paramilitary ranks, predominately the AUC.\\" According to P. W. Singer the FARC attack on the Guatape hydroelectric facility in 1998 involved militants as young as eight years old and a 2001 FARC training video depicted boys as young as 11 working with missiles. The group has also taken in children from Venezuela, Panama, and Ecuador. The Colombian government's security forces do not officially recruit children as the legal age for both compulsory and voluntary recruitment has been set at 18. However, students were allowed to enroll as cadets in military secondary schools and 16- or 17-year-olds could enter air force or national army training programs, respectively. In addition, captured enemy child combatants were employed by the Colombian military for intelligence gathering purposes in potential violation of legal prohibitions. The demobilisation efforts targeted toward the FARC in 2016‚Äì2017 have provided hope that the conflict will come to an end, limiting the number of children involved in violence. However, other armed groups have yet to be demobilised, and conflict is not yet resolved. Cuba In Cuba compulsory military service for both boys and girls starts at age 17. Male teenagers are allowed to join the Territorial Troops Militia prior to their compulsory service. Rebel Salvadoran soldier boy combatant in Perquin, El Salvador 1990, during the Salvadoran Civil War. Haiti In Haiti an unknown number of children participate in various loosely organised armed groups that are engaged in political violence. United States In the United States 17-year-olds may join the armed forces with the written agreement of parents. As of 2015 approximately 16,000 17-year-olds were being enlisted annually. The US army describes outreach to schools as the 'cornerstone' of its approach to recruitment, and the No Child Left Behind Act gives recruiters the legal right of access to all school students' contact details. Children's rights bodies have criticised the US' reliance on children to staff its armed forces. The committee on the Rights of the Child has recommended that the US raise the minimum age of enlistment to 18. In negotiations on the OPAC treaty during the 1990s the US joined the UK in strongly opposing a global minimum enlistment age of 18, and as a consequence the treaty specified a minimum age of 16. The US ratified the treaty in 2002 (but as of 2018 has not ratified the convention on the Rights of the Child itself). Per OPAC, US military personnel are normally prohibited from direct participation in hostilities until the age of 18, but they are eligible for 'forward deployment', which means that may be posted to a combat zone to perform support tasks. The committee on the Rights of the Child has called on the US to change this policy and ensure that no minor can be deployed to a forward operating area in a combat zone. In 2003 and 2004 approximately 60 underage personnel were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq in error. The Department of Defense subsequently stated that \\"the situations were immediately rectified and action taken to prevent recurrence.\\"Department of Defense, Information Paper regarding the application of child soldiers protocols, provided to Senator Barbara Boxer, November 2004. In 2008 President George W. Bush signed the Child Soldiers Protection Act into law. The law criminalises leading a military force which recruits child soldiers. It also prohibits arms sales to countries where children are used for military purposes. The law's definition of child soldiers includes \\"any person under 18 years of age who takes a direct part in hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces.\\" In 2014 President Barack Obama announced he was waiving the Child Soldiers Protection Act ban on aid and arms sales to nations that use child soldiers. =Middle East= The UN Office for Children and Armed Conflict found that the number of children either forcibly or voluntarily fighting in the various conflicts in the Middle East and Africa doubled in number in 2019. In an article for the Middle East Institute, the former deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East, Michael Mulroy, said that this is not a new trend and \\"that this should shock and alarm the international community. The growth has come in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen ‚Äî all Middle Eastern countries embroiled in intense conflict with no peace in sight.\\" Bahrain Military cadets, NCO trainees and technical personnel can enlist in the Bahrain Defence Force from the age of 15. Iran An Iranian child soldier after the Liberation of Khorramshahr Current Iranian law officially prohibits the recruitment of those under 16. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, children were drafted into the Basij army where, according to critics of the Iranian government, they \\"were sent to the front as waves of human shields\\". Other sources have estimated the total number of all Iranian casualties to be in the 200,000‚Äì600,000 range.Hammond Atlas of the 20th Century (1999) P. 134‚Äì35Dunnigan, A Quick and Dirty Guide to War (1991)Dictionary of Twentieth Century World History, by Jan Palmowski (Oxford, 1997)Clodfelter, Michael, Warfare and Armed Conflict: A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1618‚Äì1991Chirot, Daniel: Modern Tyrants: The Power and Prevalence of Evil in Our Age (1994)\\"B&J;\\": Jacob Bercovitch and Richard Jackson, International Conflict: A Chronological Encyclopedia of Conflicts and Their Management 1945‚Äì1995 (1997) p. 195 One source estimates that 3% of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War's casualties were under the age of 14. There were Iranian children who left school and participated in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War without the knowledge of their parents, including Mohammad Hossein Fahmideh. Iraqi officers claimed that they sometimes captured Iranian child soldiers as young as eight years old. As of 2018 the Iranian government has been recruiting children from Iran and Afghanistan to fight in the Syrian Civil War on the side of forces loyal to the Assad government. Israel and Palestine Jihad Shomaly, in a report entitled Use of Children in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, published in 2004 for the Defence for Children International/Palestine Section, concludes the report by stating that a handful of children perceive martyrdom a way to strike a blow against those they hold responsible for their hopeless situation, and that they have been recruited by Palestinian paramilitary groups to carry out armed attacks. However, Shomaly goes on to state that there is no systematic recruitment and that senior representatives of the groups and of the Palestinian community are against the recruitment of children as a political strategy. Shomaly gave the opinion that the political leadership of the Palestinians could do more to discourage the use of children by paramilitaries by requesting that the leadership of the paramilitaries sign a memorandum forbidding the training and recruitment of children. Hamas, the Palestinian organisation governing the Gaza strip, has been known to indoctrinate child soldiers with controversial ideologies, such as inciting violence against Israeli occupation forces. William O'Brien, a professor of Georgetown University, wrote about the active participation of Palestinian children in the First Intifada: \\"It appears that a substantial number, if not the majority, of troops of the intifada are young people, including elementary schoolchildren. They are engaged in throwing stones and molotov cocktails and other forms of violence.\\"Law and Morality in Israel's War With the PLO, New York Arab journalist Huda Al-Hussein wrote in a London Arab newspaper on 27October 2000: In 2002 the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) said that, \\"while there are reports of children participating in hostilities, there is no evidence of systematic recruitment by armed groups\\".Jihad Shomaly, et al.

In 2004, however, the organisation reported that there were at least nine documented suicide attacks involving Palestinian minors between October 2000 and March 2004, Child Soldiers International p. 292 stating: In May 2008 a Child Soldiers International report highlighted Hamas and Islamic Jihad for having \\"used children in military attacks and training\\" in its Iranian section. On 23 May 2005 Amnesty International reiterated its calls to Palestinian armed groups to put an immediate end to the use of children in armed activities: \\"Palestinian armed groups must not use children under any circumstances to carry out armed attacks or to transport weapons or other material.\\"Israel/Occupied Territories: Palestinian armed groups must not use children 23 May 2005 Turkey (PKK) During the Kurdish-Turkish conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has actively recruited and kidnapped children. The organization has been accused of abducting more than 2,000 children by Turkish Security Forces. The independent reports by the Human Rights Watch (HRW), the United Nations (UN) and the Amnesty International have confirmed the recruitment and use of child soldiers by the organization and its armed wings since the 90's. In 2001, it was reported that the recruitment of the children by the organization has been systematic. Several reports have reported about the organization's battalion, called Tabura Zaroken Sehit Agit, which has been formed mainly for the recruitment of children. It was also reported that the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) had recruited children. According to the Turkish Security Forces, the PKK has abducted more than 983 children aged between 12 and 17, and more than 400 children have fled from the organization and surrendered to the security forces. The United Nations Children's Fund report, published in 2010, saw the recruitment of the children by the PKK concerning and dangerous. In 2016, the Human Rights Watch, accused the PKK of committing war crimes by recruiting child soldiers in the Shingal region of Iraq and in neighboring countries. Throughout the Syrian Civil War multiple media outlets including Human Rights Watch have confirmed that the YPG, an organization linked to the PKK, has been recruiting and deploying child soldiers. Despite a claim by the group that it would stop using children, which has been violation of international law, the group has continued the recruitment and use of children. In 2018, the annual UN report on children in armed conflict found 224 cases of child recruitment by the People's Protection Units and its women's unit in 2017, an almost fivefold increase from the 2016. Seventy-two of the children, nearly one-third, were girls. The group was also reported to had abducted children to enlist them. Lebanon Many different sides in the Lebanese Civil War used child soldiers. A May 2008 Child Soldiers International report stated that Hezbollah trains children for military services. In 2017, the UN reported that armed groups, suspected to be Islamist militants, were recruiting children in the country. Syria Symbolic Syrian boy soldiers, fans of the Syrian Army During the ongoing Syrian Civil War children have joined groups opposed to Bashar al Assad. In 2012 the UN received allegations of rebels using child soldiers, but said they were unable to verify these. In June 2014 a United Nations report said that the opposition had recruited children in military and support roles. While there seemed to be no policy of doing so, the report said, there were no age verification procedures.U.N. Report Details Abuse of Children in Syrian War , NYT 4 February 2014 Human Rights Watch reported in 2014 that rebel factions have been using children in support and combatant roles, ranging from treating the wounded on battlefields, ferrying ammunition and other supplies to frontlines while fighting raged, to acting as snipers. Kurdish forces have also been accused of using this tactic. In 2015 Human Rights Watch claimed that 59 children, 10 of them under 15 years old, were recruited by or volunteered for the YPG or YPJ since July 2014 when the Kurdish militia leaders signed a Deed of Commitment with Geneva Call. President Assad passed a law in 2013 prohibiting the use of child soldiers (anyone under 18), the breaking of which is punishable by 10‚Äì20 years of 'penal labour.' Whether or not the law is actually enforced on government's forces has not been confirmed, and there have been allegations of children being recruited to fight for the Syrian government against rebel forces. Iranian government is recruiting children from Iran and Afghanistan to fight in the Syrian Civil War on the side of Assad's regime's forces. Yemen U.N. Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict Radhika Coomaraswamy stated in January 2010 that \\"large numbers\\" of teenage boys are being recruited in Yemeni tribal fighting. NGO activist Abdul-Rahman al- Marwani has estimated that as many as 500‚Äì600 children are either killed or wounded through tribal combat every year in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hired child soldiers from Sudan (especially from Darfur), and Yemen to fight against Houthis during the Yemeni Civil War (2015‚Äìpresent). British SAS special forces are allegedly involved in training child soldiers in Yemen. Reportedly at least 40% of soldiers fighting for the Saudi-led coalition are children. Saudi Arabia is also hiring Yemeni child soldiers to guard Saudi border against Houthis. During an interview by Lawfare, the former Deputy Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Mick Mulroy explained that the U.S. has a law called the Child Soldiers Prevention Act that was passed unanimously by Congress. This banned the U.S. from providing military assistance or arms to countries that use children as soldiers, but the president may waive the application for specific countries if it is deemed to be in the national interest. Hogg, Charu Lata (28 March 2016). \\"The Loophole That Lets the U.S. Government Fund the Use of Child Soldiers\\". Open Society Foundations. Retrieved 22 November 2017. Mulroy criticized the U.S. for providing a waiver for Saudi Arabia and said that the U.S. had an obligation to hold its partners to at least the same standard as it holds its adversaries. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-childsoldiers- exclusive/exclusive-overruling-his-experts-pompeo-keeps-saudis-off-us-child- soldiers-list-idUSKCN1TJ25H https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast- yemens-ongoing-tragedy He further explained there are an estimated 100,000 children fighting in over 18 countries around the world and that child soldiers use in the Middle East Doubled in 2019. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-children-soldiers/global-count- finds-cases-of-child-soldiers-more-than-doubling-idUSKCN1Q12HQ Mulroy said, \\"this is a problem that every adult should care about\\". https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-yemens-ongoing-tragedy =Asia= Young Khmer Rouge fighters In 2004 the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) reported that in Asia thousands of children are involved in fighting forces in active conflict and ceasefire situations in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Government refusal of access to conflict zones has made it impossible to document the numbers involved. In 2004 Myanmar was unique in the region as the only country where government armed forces forcibly recruited and used children between the ages of 12 and 16. Child Soldiers International pp. 18,159‚Äì161 Johnny and Luther Htoo, twin brothers who jointly led the God's Army guerrilla group, were estimated to have been around ten years old when they began leading the group in 1997. Afghanistan Militias recruited thousands of child soldiers during the Afghan civil war over three decades. Many are still fighting now, for the Taliban. Some of those taken from Islamic religious schools, or madrassas, are used as suicide bombers and gunmen. A propaganda video of boys marching in camouflage uniform and using slogans of martyrdom was issued in 2009 by the Afghan Taliban's leadership. This included a eulogy to a 14-year-old Taliban fighter who allegedly killed an American soldier. Burma/Myanmar The State Peace and Development Council has asserted that all of its soldiers volunteered and that all of those accepted are 18 or over. According to Human Rights Watch as many as 70,000 boys serve in Burma/Myanmar's national army, the Tatmadaw, with children as young as 11 being forcibly recruited off the streets. Desertion, the group reported, leads to punishments of three to five years in prison or even execution. The group has also stated that about 5,000‚Äì7,000 children serve with a range of different armed ethnic opposition groups, most notably in the United Wa State Army. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a report in June 2009 mentioning \\"grave violations\\" against children in the country by both the rebels and the government. The administration announced on 4August that they would send a team into Burma/Myanmar to press for more action. India In India volunteers can join the Navy from the age of 16 and a half, and the Air Force from the age of 17. These soldiers are not deployed until after training by which time they are 18 years or older. Nepal An estimated 6,000‚Äì9,000 children serve in the Communist Party of Nepal forces. As of 2010, child soldiers of the CPN has since been demobilized The Philippines Islamist and communist armed groups fighting the government have routinely relied on child recruits. In 2001 Human Rights Watch reported that an estimated 13 percent of the 10,000 soldiers in the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) were children, and that some paramilitary forces linked to the government were also using children. In 2016 the MILF allowed 1,869 children to leave and committed not to recruit children any more. In the same year, however, the UN reported that other armed groups in the Philippines continue to recruit children, mainly between the ages of 13 and 17. =Europe= According to Child Soldiers International the trend in Europe has been towards recruiting only adults from age 18; most states only allow adult recruitment, and as of 2016 no armed groups were known to be using children. one country, the United Kingdom, was enlisting children from age 16, and five were enlisting from age 17 (Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, and Netherlands). Of these, the UK recruits children in the greatest numbers; in 2016, approximately a quarter of new recruits to the British army were aged under 18. All European states have ratified the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and so child recruits are not typically used in hostilities until they reach adulthood. Children were used as combatants in the First Chechen War during the 1990s. The brave Righetto (1851). Replica of the Giovanni Strazza statue in the lobby of the grand staircase in Palazzo Litta.

Austria Austria invites children to begin their adult compulsory military service one year early, at age 17, with the consent of their parents. Cyprus Cyprus invites children to begin their adult compulsory military service two years early, at age 16, with the consent of their parents. France France enlists military personnel from age 17, and students for military technical school from age 16; 3% of its armed forces' intake is aged under 18. Germany Germany enlists military personnel from age 17; in 2015 6% of its armed forces' intake was aged under 18. Netherlands The Netherlands enlists military personnel from age 17; in 2014 5% of its armed forces' intake was aged under 18. Ukraine During the armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine in 2014 Justice for Peace at Donbas documented 41 verified individual cases of child recruitment into armed formations. Of those 37 concerned the participation of children in armed formations on territory not controlled by Ukraine and 4 on territory controlled by Ukraine. There were 31 further reports of child recruitment which could not be verified. Of the 37 verified cases on territory not controlled by Ukraine, 33 were boys and 4 were girls; 57% were aged 16‚Äì17, 35% were under 15, and age could not be determined in 8% of cases. United Kingdom Children from age 16 in the British army, on parade at the Army Foundation College, Harrogate, UK The British armed forces enlist from age 16 and accept applications from children aged 15 years, 7 months. approximately one-quarter of enlistees to the British army were aged under 18. As per the OPAC the UK does not routinely send child recruits to participate in hostilities, and it requires recruiters to seek parental consent prior to enlistment. Children's rights bodies have criticised the UK's reliance on children to staff its armed forces. Although the UK normally prohibits deployment to war zones until recruits turn 18, it does not rule out doing so. It inadvertently deployed 22 personnel aged under 18 to Iraq and Afghanistan between 2003 and 2010. The committee on the Rights of the Child has urged the UK to alter its policy so as to ensure that children cannot take part in hostilities under any circumstances. In negotiations on the OPAC during the 1990s the UK joined the US in opposing a global minimum enlistment age of 18. In 2014, a group of 17-year-old army recruits alleged that 17 instructors had maltreated them during their training over nine days in June 2014. It was reported as the British army's largest ever investigation of abuse. Among the allegations were that the instructors assaulted recruits, smeared cattle dung into their mouths, and held their heads under water. The court martial began in 2018, but soon collapsed after the judge ruled that the Royal Military Police (RMP) had abused the investigatory process and that a fair trial would therefore not be possible. =Oceania= Australia The Australian Defence Force allows personnel to enlist with parental consent from the age of 17. Personnel under the age of 18 cannot be deployed overseas or used in direct combat except in extreme circumstances where it is not possible to evacuate them. New Zealand As of 2018, the minimum age for joining the New Zealand Defence Force was 17. Movement to end military use of children 2008 poster by Rafaela Tasca and Carlos Latuff The military use of children has been common throughout history; only in recent decades has the practice met with informed criticism and concerted efforts to end it. Progress has been slow, partly because many armed forces have relied on children to fill their ranks, and partly because the behaviour of non-state armed groups is difficult to influence. = Recent history =  1970s‚Äì1980s  International efforts to limit the participation of children in armed conflict began with the Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977 (Art. 77.2). The new Protocols prohibited the military recruitment of children aged under 15, but continued to allow state armed forces and non-state armed groups to recruit children from age 15 and use them in warfare. Efforts were renewed during negotiations on the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), when Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) campaigned for the new treaty to outlaw child recruitment entirely. Some states, whose armed forces relied on recruiting below the age of 18, resisted this, so the final treaty text of 1989 only reflected the existing legal standard: the prohibition of the direct participation of children aged under 15 in hostilities.  1990s  In the 1990s NGOs established the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) to work with sympathetic governments on a campaign for a new treaty to correct the deficiencies they saw in the CRC. After a global campaign lasting six years, the treaty was adopted in 2000 as the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC). The treaty prohibits child conscription, ensures that military recruits are no younger than 16, and forbids the use of child recruits in hostilities. The treaty also forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for any purpose. Although most states negotiating OPAC supported a ban on recruiting children, some states, led by the US in alliance with the UK, objected to this. As such, the treaty does not ban the recruitment of children aged 16 or 17, although it allows states to bind themselves to a higher standard in law.  2000s‚Äìpresent  Red Hand Day, the International Day Against Use of Child Soldiers, is often marked by displaying red handprints. After the adoption of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, a campaign for global ratification made swift progress. As of 2018 OPAC had been ratified by 167 states. The campaign also successfully encouraged many states not to recruit children at all. In 2001 83 states only allowed adult enlistment, by 2016 this had increased to 126, which is 71 percent of countries with armed forces. Approximately 60 non-state armed groups have also entered agreements to stop or scale back their use of children, often brokered by the UN or the NGO Geneva Call. Child Soldiers International reports that the success of the OPAC treaty, combined with the gradual decline in child recruitment by state armed forces, has led to a reduction of children in military organisations worldwide. the recruitment and use of children remains widespread. In particular, militant Islamist organisations such as ISIS and Boko Haram, as well as armed groups fighting them, have used children extensively. In addition, the three most populous states ‚Äì China, India and the United States ‚Äì still allow their armed forces to enlist children aged 16 or 17, as do five of the Group of Seven countries: Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, again. = Events = Red Hand Day (also known as the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers) on 12February is an annual commemoration day to draw public attention to the practice of using children as soldiers in wars and armed conflicts. The date reflects the entry into force of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. = Countering the militarisation of childhood = A United States Army sergeant drills high school students at Jackson High School in Georgia, US. Many states which do not allow their armed forces to recruit children have continued to draw criticism for marketing military life to children through the education system, in civic spaces and in popular entertainment such as films and videogames. Some commentators have argued that this marketing to children is manipulative and part of a military recruitment process and should therefore be evaluated ethically as such. This principle has led some groups to campaign for relations between military organisations and young people to be regulated, on the grounds of children's rights and public health. Examples are the Countering the Militarization of Youth programme of War Resisters' International, the Stop Recruiting Kids campaign in the US, and the Military Out of Schools campaign in the UK. Similar concerns have been raised in Germany and Israel. Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers Child Soldiers International defines reintegration as: \\"The process through which children formerly associated with armed forces/groups are supported to return to civilian life and play a valued role in their families and communities\\" Programs that aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate child soldiers, such as those sponsored by UNICEF, often emphasise three components: family reunification/community network, psychological support, and education/economic opportunity.Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit. \\"Child Soldiers: Prevention, Demobilization, and Reintegration\\" May 2002 These efforts take a minimum commitment of 3 to 5 years in order for programs to be successfully implemented. Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family. Reintegration efforts can become challenging when the child in question has committed war crimes because in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated. In situations such as these, it is important that the child's needs are balanced with a sense of community justice. These situations should be addressed immediately because if not, many children face the threat of re-enlistment. There are also two areas of reintegration that warrant special consideration: female child soldiers and drug use among child soldiers. Child soldiers under the influence of drugs or who have contracted sexually transmitted diseases require additional programmes specific to their needs.

The term is partially interchangeable with the hacker term lamer. It can also signify a layman with only user account privileges, as opposed to a power user or administrator, who has knowledge of, and access to, superuser accounts; for example, an end luser who cannot be trusted with a root account for system administration. This term is popular with technical support staff who have to deal with lusers as part of their job, often metaphorically employing a LART (Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool, also known as a clue-by-four, cluestick, or cluebat), meaning turning off the user's access to computer resources and the like. History The Jargon File states that the word was coined around 1975 at MIT. Under ITS, when a user first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed control-Z to get the computer's attention, it printed out some status information, including how many people were already using the computer. A patch to the system was then written to print \\"14 losers\\" instead of \\"14 users\\", as a joke. For a while, several hackers who disagreed on the appropriateness of the change struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the backs of the others; any time a user logged into the computer it was equally probable that a user would see, say, \\"users\\" or \\"losers\\". Finally, someone tried the compromise \\"lusers\\", and it stuck. Later, ITS also had the command \\"luser\\", which attempted to summon assistance from a list of designated helpers. Although ITS ceased to be used in the mid-1990s, use of the term continued to spread, partly because in Unix-style computer operating systems, \\"user\\" designates all unprivileged accounts, while the superuser, or root, is the special user account used for system administration. \\"root\\" is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions (to all files and programs) in all modes (single- or multi-user). The usage lives on, however, and the term \\"luser\\" is often seen in program comments and on Usenet. On IRC, \`/lusers\` (which abbreviates \\"list users\\") is a common command to get the number of users connected to a server or network.

His base of power was the largest circulation newspaper in the world, the Daily Express, which appealed to the conservative working class with intensely patriotic news and editorials. During the Second World War, he played a major role in mobilising industrial resources as Winston Churchill's Minister of Aircraft Production. The young Max Aitken had a gift for making money and was a millionaire by 30. His business ambitions quickly exceeded opportunities in Canada and he moved to Britain. There he befriended Bonar Law and with his support won a seat in the House of Commons at the December 1910 United Kingdom general election. A knighthood followed shortly after. During the First World War he ran the Canadian Records office in London, and played a role in the removal of H. H. Asquith as prime minister in 1916. The resulting coalition government (with David Lloyd George as prime minister and Bonar Law as Chancellor of the Exchequer) rewarded Aitken with a peerage and, briefly, a Cabinet post as Minister of Information. Postwar, the now Lord Beaverbrook concentrated on his business interests. He built the Daily Express into the most successful mass- circulation newspaper in the world, with sales of 2.25 million copies a day across Britain. He used it to pursue personal campaigns, most notably for tariff reform and for the British Empire to become a free trade bloc. Beaverbrook supported the governments of Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain throughout the 1930s and was persuaded by another long standing political friend, Winston Churchill, to serve as his Minister of Aircraft Production from May 1940. Churchill and others later praised his ministerial contributions. He resigned due to ill-health in 1941 but later in the war was appointed Lord Privy Seal. Beaverbrook spent his later life running his newspapers, which by then included the Evening Standard and the Sunday Express. He served as Chancellor of the University of New Brunswick and developed a reputation as a historian with his books on political and military history. Early life Aitken was born in Maple, Ontario, Canada, in 1879, one of the ten children of William Cuthbert Aitken, a Scottish-born Presbyterian minister, and Jane (Noble), the daughter of a prosperous local farmer and storekeeper. When he was a year old, the family moved to Newcastle, New Brunswick, which Aitken later considered to be his hometown. It was here, at the age of 13, that he set up a school newspaper, The Leader. Whilst at school, he delivered newspapers, sold newspaper subscriptions and was the local correspondent for the St. John Daily Star. Aitken took the entrance examinations for Dalhousie University, but because he had declined to sit the Greek and Latin papers he was refused entry. He registered at the King's College Law School, but left after a short while. This was to be his only formal higher education. Aitken worked in a shop, then borrowed some money to move to Chatham, New Brunswick, where he worked as a local correspondent for the Montreal Star, sold life insurance and collected debts. Aitken attempted to train as a lawyer and worked for a short time in the law office of R B Bennett, a future prime minister of Canada. Aitken managed Bennett's successful campaign for a place on Chatham town council. When Bennett left the law firm, Aitken moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where he again sold life insurance before moving to Calgary where he helped to run Bennett's campaign for a seat in the legislative assembly of the North-West Territories in the 1898 general election. After an unsuccessful attempt to establish a meat business, Aitken returned to Saint John and to selling insurance.; Early business career In 1900, Aitken made his way to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where John F. Stairs, a member of the city's dominant business family, gave him employment and trained him in the business of finance. In 1904, when Stairs launched the Royal Securities Corporation, Aitken became a minority shareholder and the firm's general manager. Under the tutelage of Stairs, who would be his mentor and friend, Aitken engineered a number of successful business deals and was planning a series of bank mergers. Stairs' unexpected early death in September 1904 led to Aitken acquiring control of the company and moving to Montreal, then the business capital of Canada. There he bought and sold companies, invested in stocks and shares and also developed business interests in both Cuba and Puerto Rico. He started a weekly magazine, the Canadian Century in 1910, invested in the Montreal Herald and almost acquired the Montreal Gazette. In 1907 he founded the Montreal Engineering Company. In 1909, also under the umbrella of his Royal Securities Company, Aitken founded the Calgary Power Company Limited, now the TransAlta Corporation, and oversaw the building of the Horseshoe Falls hydro station. In 1910‚Äì1911 Aitken acquired a number of small regional cement plants in Canada, including Sir Sandford Fleming's Western Canada Cement Co. plant at Exshaw, Alberta, and amalgamated them into Canada Cement, eventually controlling four-fifths of the cement production in Canada. Canada was booming economically at the time, and Aitken had a monopoly on the material. There were irregularities in the stock transfers leading to the conglomeration of the cement plants, resulting in much criticism of Aitken, as well as accusations of price-gouging and poor management of the cement plants under his company's control. Aitken sold his shares, making a large amount of money. Aitken had made his first visit to Britain in September 1908, and when he returned there in the spring of 1910, in an attempt to raise money to form a steel company, he decided to make the move permanent, but not before he led the underwriting, with a preponderance of British money, of an amalgamation of smaller units into the Steel Company of Canada. Very shortly later Aitken moved his family to the UK. Move to Britain Cherkley Court In 1910, Aitken moved to Britain and he became friends with Bonar Law, a native of New Brunswick and the only Canadian to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The two men had a lot in common: they were both sons of the manse from Scottish-Canadian families and both were successful businessmen. Aitken persuaded Bonar Law to support him in standing for the Unionist Party in the December 1910 general election at Ashton-under- Lyne. Aitken was an excellent organiser and, with plenty of money for publicity, he won the seat by 196 votes. Aitken rarely spoke in the House of Commons, but did promise substantial financial support to the Unionist Party, and in 1911 he was knighted by King George V. Aitken's political influence grew when Bonar Law replaced A.J. Balfour as leader of the Unionist party late in 1911. Aitken bought Cherkley Court near Leatherhead and entertained lavishly there. In 1913 the house was offered as a venue for negotiations between Bonar Law and the Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith, over Ulster and Irish home rule. Later in life Aitken wrote about his early political efforts: Aitken continued to grow his business interests while in Parliament, and also began to build a British newspaper empire. After the death of Charles Rolls in 1910, Aitken bought his shares in Rolls-Royce Limited, and over the next two years gradually increased his holding in the company. However, Claude Johnson, Rolls-Royce's Commercial managing director, resisted his attempt to gain control of the company, and in October 1913 Aitken sold his holding to James Buchanan Duke of the American Tobacco Company. In January 1911 Aitken secretly invested ¬£25,000 in the failing Daily Express. An attempt to buy the Evening Standard failed, but he did gain control of another London evening paper, The Globe. In November 1916 a share deal worth ¬£17,500, with Lawson Johnson, landed Aitken a controlling interest in the Daily Express, but again he kept the deal secret. First World War Lord Beaverbrook Due to the outbreak of the First World War, Aitken was able to show off his great organisational skills. He was innovative in the employment of artists, photographers, and film makers to record life on the Western Front. Aitken also established the Canadian War Memorials Fund, which evolved into a collection of art works by the premier artists and sculptors in Britain and Canada. In accordance with establishing these works, he also was instrumental in creating the Canadian War Records Office in London and arranged for stories about Canadian forces appearing in newspapers. His visits to the Western Front, with the honorary rank of colonel in the Canadian Army, resulted in his 1916 book Canada in Flanders, a three-volume collection that chronicled the achievements of Canadian soldiers on the battlefields. Aitken also wrote several books after the war, including Politicians and the Press in 1925 and Politicians and the War in 1928. Aitken became increasingly hostile towards Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, whom he considered to be mismanaging the war effort. Aitken's opinion of Asquith did not improve when he failed to get a post in the Cabinet reshuffle of May 1915. An attempt by Bonar Law to secure the KCMG for Aitken was also blocked by Asquith. Aitken was happy to play a small part, which he greatly exaggerated, as a go-between when Asquith was forced from office and replaced by David Lloyd George in December 1916. Lloyd George offered to appoint Aitken as President of the Board of Trade. At that time, an MP taking a cabinet post for the first time had to resign and stand for re-election in a by-election. Aitken made arrangements for this, but then Lloyd George decided to appoint Albert Stanley instead. Aitken was a friend of Stanley and agreed to continue with the resignation, so that Stanley could take Aitken's seat in Parliament and be eligible for ministerial office. In return, Aitken received a peerage on 23 January 1917 as the 1st Baron Beaverbrook, the name \\"Beaverbrook\\" being adopted from a small community near his boyhood home. He had initially considered \\"Lord Miramichi\\", but rejected it on the advice of Louise Manny as too difficult to pronounce. The name \\"Beaverbrook\\" also had the advantage of conveying a distinctive Canadian ring to the title. Beaverbrook's controlling stake in the Daily Express became public knowledge later in 1917, and he was criticised by parts of the Conservative Party for financing a publication they regarded as irresponsible and often unhelpful to the party. In February 1918, Beaverbrook became the first Minister of Information in the newly formed Ministry of Information, was also made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and was sworn of the Privy Council. Beaverbrook became responsible for propaganda in Allied and neutral countries and Lord Northcliffe (owner of the Daily Mail and The Times) became Director of Propaganda with control of propaganda in enemy countries. Beaverbrook established the British War Memorials Committee within the Ministry, on lines similar to the earlier Canadian war art scheme, but when he established a private charity that would receive income from BWMC exhibitions, it was regarded as a conflict of interest and he dropped the scheme. Beaverbrook had a number of clashes with the Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour over the use of intelligence material. He felt that intelligence should become part of his department, but Balfour disagreed. Eventually the intelligence committee was assigned to Beaverbrook but they then resigned en masse to be re-employed by the Foreign Office. In August 1918, Lloyd George became furious with Beaverbrook over a leader in the Daily Express threatening to withdraw support from the government over tariff reform. Beaverbrook increasingly came under attack from MPs who distrusted a press baron being employed by the state. He survived but became increasingly frustrated with his limited role and influence, and in October 1918 he resigned due to ill-health. A tooth had become infected with actinomycosis and the often fatal disease progressed into his throat; his English doctors were unable to discover a cure, and it was a Portuguese medic who cured him by administering iodine solution orally until the fungus was arrested. A. J. P. Taylor later wrote that Beaverbrook was a pathbreaker who \\"invented all the methods of publicity\\" used by Britain to promote the war, including the nation's first war artists, the first war photographers, and the first makers of war films. He was especially effective in promoting the sales of war bonds to the general public. Nevertheless, he was widely disliked and distrusted by the political elite, who were suspicious of all they sneeringly called \\"press lords.\\" Press baron Lord Beaverbrook, August 1941 After the war, Beaverbrook concentrated on running the Daily Express. He turned the dull newspaper into a glittering and witty journal with an optimistic attitude, filled with an array of dramatic photo layouts. He hired first-rate writers such as Francis Williams and the cartoonist David Low. He embraced new technology and bought new presses to print the paper in Manchester. In 1919 the circulation of the Daily Express was under 40,000 a day; by 1937 it was 2,329,000 a day, making it the most successful of all British newspapers and generating huge profits for Beaverbrook whose wealth was already such that he never took a salary. After the Second World War, the Daily Express became the largest-selling newspaper in the world, with a circulation of 3,706,000. Beaverbrook launched the Sunday Express in December 1918, but it only established a significant readership after John Junor became its editor in 1954. In 1923, in a joint deal with Lord Rothermere, Beaverbrook bought the Evening Standard. Beaverbrook acquired a controlling stake in the Glasgow Evening Citizen, and in 1928 he launched the Scottish Daily Express. Consolidation was rampant. James Curran and Jean Seaton state: Beaverbrook purchased The Vineyard, Fulham, a \\"tiny Tudor house in Hurlingham Road\\" where ... \\"far from the centre of London I was relieved of casual callers and comparatively free of long- winded visitors. I provided facilities by means of private telephone lines without any direct contact with the Telephone Exchanges. Thus the political conferences held there were safeguarded against interruption.\\" Powerful friends and acquaintances such as Asquith, Lloyd George, Churchill, Frederick Edwin Smith, Philip Sassoon, Diana and Duff Cooper, Balfour and Tim Healy were guests at both Cherkley and the Vineyard. The circle included Valentine Castlerosse, H. G. Wells and Rudyard Kipling, who was godfather to Beaverbrook's youngest son Peter, but this did nothing to repair the rift that developed between them when Beaverbrook endorsed Irish Home Rule. Beaverbrook, the first baron of Fleet Street, was often denounced as excessively powerful because his newspapers supposedly could make or break almost anyone. Beaverbrook enjoyed using his papers to attack his opponents and to promote his friends. From 1919 to 1922 he attacked David Lloyd George and his government on several issues. He began supporting independent Conservative candidates and campaigned for fifteen years to remove Stanley Baldwin from the leadership of the Conservative Party. He very shrewdly sold the majority of his share holdings before the 1929 crash and in the resulting depression launched a new political party to promote free trade within the British Empire. Empire Free Trade Crusade candidates had some success. An Independent Conservative who supported Empire Free Trade won the Twickenham by-election in 1929. The Empire Free Trade candidate won the South Paddington by-election in October 1930. In February 1931, Empire Free Trade lost the Islington East by- election and by splitting the vote with the Conservatives allowed Labour to hold a seat they had been expected to lose. Duff Cooper's victory for the Conservatives in St. George's Westminster by-election in March 1931 marked the end of the movement as an electoral force. On 17 March 1931, during the St. George's Westminster by-election, Stanley Baldwin described the media barons who owned British newspapers as having \\"Power without responsibility ‚Äì the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages.\\" In the 1930s, while personally attempting to dissuade King Edward VIII from continuing his affair with American divorcee, Wallis Simpson, Beaverbrook's newspapers published every titbit of the affair, especially allegations about pro-Nazi sympathies. Beaverbrook supported the Munich Agreement and hoped the newly named Duke of Windsor would seek a peace deal with Germany. Testifying before a Parliamentary inquiry in 1947, former Express employee and future MP Michael Foot alleged that Beaverbrook kept a blacklist of notable public figures who were to be denied any publicity in his papers because of personal disputes. Foot said they included Sir Thomas Beecham, Paul Robeson, Haile Selassie and No√´l Coward. Beaverbrook himself gave evidence before the inquiry and vehemently denied the allegations; Express Newspapers general manager E. J. Robertson denied that Robeson had been blacklisted, but did admit that Coward had been \\"boycotted\\" because he had enraged Beaverbrook with his film In Which We Serve, for in the opening sequence Coward included an ironic shot showing a copy of the Daily Express floating in the dockside rubbish bearing the headline \\"No War This Year\\".Movie 'In Which We Serve' at 0:05:57; In the late 1930s, Beaverbrook used his newspapers to promote the appeasement policies of the Chamberlain government. The slogan 'There will be no war' was used by the Daily Express. Second World War Lord Beaverbrook during the Second World War During the Second World War, in May 1940, his friend Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, appointed Beaverbrook as Minister of Aircraft Production. With Churchill's blessing, Beaverbrook overhauled all aspects of war-time aircraft production. He increased production targets by 15% across the board, took control of aircraft repairs and RAF storage units, replaced the management of plants that were underperforming, and released German Jewish engineers from internment to work in the factories. He seized materials and equipment destined for other departments and was perpetually at odds with the Air Ministry. His appeal for pots and pans \\"to make Spitfires\\" was afterwards revealed by his son Sir Max Aitken to have been nothing more than a propaganda exercise. Still, a Time Magazine cover story declared, \\"Even if Britain goes down this fall, it will not be Lord Beaverbrook's fault. If she holds out, it will be his triumph. This war is a war of machines. It will be won on the assembly line.\\" Under Beaverbrook, fighter and bomber production increased so much so that Churchill declared: \\"His personal force and genius made this Aitken's finest hour.\\" Beaverbrook's impact on wartime production has been much debated but he certainly energised production at a time when it was desperately needed. However, it has been argued that aircraft production was already rising when Beaverbrook took charge and that he was fortunate to inherit a system which was just beginning to bear fruit. Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, Head of Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain wrote that \\"We had the organization, we had the men, we had the spirit which could bring us victory in the air but we had not the supply of machines necessary to withstand the drain of continuous battle. Lord Beaverbrook gave us those machines, and I do not believe that I exaggerate when I say that no other man in England could have done so.\\" Beaverbrook resigned on 30 April 1941 and, after a month as Minister of State, Churchill appointed him to the post of Minister of Supply. Here Beaverbrook clashed with Ernest Bevin who, as Minister of Labour and National Service, refused to let Beaverbrook take over any of his responsibilities. In February 1942, Beaverbrook became Minister of War Production and again clashed with Bevin, this time over shipbuilding. In the face of Bevin's refusal to work with him, Beaverbrook resigned after only twelve days in the post. In September 1943 he was appointed Lord Privy Seal, outside of the Cabinet, and held that post until the end of the war. In 1941, Beaverbrook headed the British delegation to Moscow with his American counterpart Averell Harriman. This made Beaverbrook the first senior British politician to meet Soviet leader Joseph Stalin since Adolf Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union. Much impressed by Stalin and the sacrifice of the Soviet people, he returned to London determined to persuade Churchill to launch a second front in Europe to help draw German resources away from the Eastern Front to aid the Soviets. Despite their disagreement over the second front, Beaverbrook remained a close confidant of Churchill throughout the war, and could regularly be found with Churchill until the early hours of the morning. Clement Attlee commented that \\"Churchill often listened to Beaverbrook's advice but was too sensible to take it.\\" In addition to his ministerial roles, Beaverbrook headed the Anglo- American Combined Raw Materials Board from 1942 to 1945 and accompanied Churchill to several wartime meetings with President Roosevelt. He was able to relate to Roosevelt in a different way to Churchill and became close to Roosevelt during these visits. This friendship sometimes irritated Churchill who felt that Beaverbrook was distracting Roosevelt from concentrating on the war effort. For his part Roosevelt seems to have enjoyed the distraction. Later life Beaverbrook devoted himself to Churchill's 1945 general election campaign, but a Daily Express headline warning that a Labour victory would amount to the 'Gestapo in Britain' (adapted from a passage in a radio election speech by Churchill on 4 June) was a huge mistake and completely misjudged the public mood. Beaverbrook renounced his British citizenship and left the Conservative Party in 1951, but remained an Empire loyalist throughout his life. He opposed both Britain's acceptance of post-war loans from America and Britain's application to join the European Economic Community in 1961. In 1953 he became chancellor-for-life of the University of New Brunswick through an Act of the local legislature. He became the university's greatest benefactor, fulfilling the same role for the city of Fredericton and the province as a whole. He would provide additional buildings for the university, scholarship funds, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Beaverbrook Skating Rink, the Lord Beaverbrook Hotel, with profits donated to charity, the Playhouse, Louise Manny's early folklore work, and numerous other projects. He bought the archive papers of both Bonar Law and David Lloyd George and placed them in the Beaverbrook Library within the Daily Express Building. Personal life Gladys Drury, sometime before her marriage On 29 January 1906, in Halifax, Aitken married Gladys Henderson Drury, daughter of Major-General Charles William Drury CBE (a first cousin of Admiral Sir Charles Carter Drury) and Mary Louise Drury (n√©e Henderson). They had three children before her death on 1 December 1927. Their son Max Aitken Jr. became a fighter pilot with 601 Squadron, rising to Wing Commander with 16 victories in World War II. Beaverbrook remained a widower for many years until 1963 when he married Marcia Anastasia Christoforides (1910‚Äì1994), the widow of his friend Sir James Dunn. Beaverbrook was rarely a faithful husband, and even in old age was often accused of treating women with disrespect. In Britain he established the then- married Jean Norton as his mistress at Cherkley. Aitken left Norton for a Jewish ballet dancer named Lily Ernst whom he had rescued from pre-war Austria. Historian After the First World War, Beaverbrook had written Politicians and the Press in 1925, and Politicians and the War in two volumes, the first in 1928 and the second in 1932, republished in one volume in 1960. Upon their original publication, the books were largely ignored by professional historians and the only favourable reviews were in Beaverbrook's own newspapers. However, when the combined edition of Politicians and the War came out, the reviews were more positive. A. J. P. Taylor said it was \\"Tacitus and Aubrey rolled into one\\". Later Taylor said: \\"The enduring merits of the book are really beyond cavil. It provides essential testimony for events during a great political crisis...It contains character sketches worthy of Aubrey. On a wider canvas, it displays the behaviour of political leaders in wartime. The narrative is carried along by rare zest and wit, yet with the detached impartialty of the true scholar\\". Sir John Elliot in 1981 said the work \\"will remain, despite all carping, the authoritative narrative; nor does the story want in the telling thereof\\". Men and Power 1917‚Äì1918 was published in 1956. It is not a coherent narrative, but is divided by separate episodes centred on one man, such as Carson, Robertson, Rothermere and others. The reviews were favourable, with Taylor's review in The Observer greatly pleasing Beaverbrook. The book sold over 23,000 copies. When The Decline and Fall of Lloyd George was published in 1963, favourable reviewers included Clement Attlee, Roy Jenkins, Robert Blake, Lord Longford, Sir C. P. Snow, Lady Violet Bonham Carter, Richard Crossman and Denis Brogan. Kenneth Young said the book was \\"the finest of all his writing\\". Beaverbrook was both admired and despised in Britain, sometimes at the same time: in his 1956 autobiography, David Low quotes H.G. Wells as saying of Beaverbrook: \\"If ever Max ever gets to Heaven, he won't last long. He will be chucked out for trying to pull off a merger between Heaven and Hell after having secured a controlling interest in key subsidiary companies in both places, of course.\\" Beaverbrook was of an imperialist mindset, with the quote, \\"There are countries so underdeveloped today that the gift of independence is like the gift of a razor to a child\\" attributed to him in a panel discussion on Canadian TV. Death Bust of Lord Beaverbrook, where his ashes are deposited, in the town square of Newcastle, Miramichi, New Brunswick (IR Walker 2008) Beaverbrook House, formerly the Old Manse Library, and earlier the boyhood home of Aitken, in Newcastle, Miramichi, New Brunswick (IR Walker 1983) Lord Beaverbrook died in Leatherhead in 1964, aged 85. He had recently attended a birthday banquet organised by fellow Canadian press baron, Lord Thomson of Fleet, where he was determined to be seen on his usual good form, despite suffering from cancer. A bust of him by Oscar Nemon stands in the park in the town square of Newcastle, New Brunswick, not far from where he sold newspapers as a young boy. His ashes are in the plinth of the bust. The Beaverbrook Foundation continues his philanthropic interests. In 1957, a bronze statue of Lord Beaverbrook was erected at the centre of Officers' Square in Fredericton, New Brunswick, paid for by money raised by children throughout the province.

Waugh later lampooned his employer by portraying him as Lord Copper in Scoop and as Lord Monomark in both Put Out More Flags and Vile Bodies. The Kinks recorded \\"Mr Churchill Says\\" for their 1969 album Arthur, which contains the lines: \\"Mr Beaverbrook says: 'We've gotta save our tin/And all the garden gates and empty cans are gonna make us win...'.\\" Beaverbrook was one of eight notable Britons cited in Bj√∏rge Lillelien's famous \\"Your boys took a hell of a beating\\" commentary at the end of an English football team defeat to Norway in 1981, mentioned alongside British Prime Ministers Churchill, Thatcher and Attlee. In the alternate history novel Dominion by C. J. Sansom, Beaverbrook serves as the collaborationist Prime Minister of a Nazi-occupied Britain.

It simulates the 1967 Grand Prix season. Gameplay The game offers several modes in which the player can race alone or against AI opponents. The game also features multiplayer via LAN. Many parameters affecting the skill and aggressiveness of the AI drivers can be specified. Development Inspired by the 1966 film Grand Prix, the developers chose to base the game on the 1967 Formula 1 Grand Prix season because during that period tracks were narrow and lined with trees, houses, and other elements that in a video game can serve as backgrounds to enhance the sensation of speed. In addition, the more primitive suspension of cars of the time meant that the car physics could be more visually dramatic. However, the amount of time that has passed since the 1967 Grand Prix season meant that some of the tracks the designers wanted to recreate no longer existed in their original form. The team visited town halls to get blueprints for defunct tracks. Licensing could also be difficult. Papyrus co-founder Dave Kaemmer commented, \\"It's not a pleasant thing to call someone on the phone and say that you want to license their dead son's name, but people have been very helpful.\\" Reception =Sales= Grand Prix Legends was a commercial failure; Andy Mahood of PC Gamer US described its sales as \\"abysmally poor\\". In 2003, writer Mark H. Walker reported that \\"the game sold only a few thousand copies\\" in the United States, which he attributed to the general unpopularity of Formula One racing in the country. He noted that its \\"steep learning curve kept many fans away\\" in European markets. GameSpot's Gord Goble attributed its performance to the \\"combination of treacherous gameplay, sometimes glacial frame rates, and esoteric subject matter\\". It ultimately totaled 200,000 sales by 2004. =Reviews= The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. GameSpot said, \\"Grand Prix Legends will reward you with arguably the most intense racing experience ever seen on a personal computer.\\" Grand Prix Legends was the runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1998 \\"Best Driving\\" award, which ultimately went to Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit. The editors wrote of Grand Prix Legends, \\"Arguably the most ambitious and realistic driving simulation to date‚Äîmodeling the thrills and difficulties of Grand Prix racing circa 1967‚Äîit is also perhaps the toughest to play. It's an awesome game for those who can handle it.\\" Grand Prix Legends won Computer Games Strategy Pluss 1998 \\"Sports Game of the Year\\" award. The editors wrote, \\"Racing games are always popular, and there are a lot of them, but few if any approach Grand Prix Racings level of sophistication and uncompromising detail.\\" In 1999, Next Generation listed Grand Prix Legends as number 47 on their \\"Top 50 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"Not only does it have the most realistic physics model yet in a racing game [...] a brilliant premise, and the best drive AI we've seen, but GPL enables players to do something they simply never could in the real world.

Early life  Pole was born at Stourton Castle, Staffordshire, on 12 March 1500, the third son of Sir Richard Pole and Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury. He was named after the now Blessed Reginald of Orleans, O.P. His maternal grandparents were George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Isabella Neville, Duchess of Clarence; thus he was a great-nephew of kings Edward IV and Richard III and a great-grandson of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick. Pole received his early education nursery at Sheen Priory. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1512, and at Oxford was taught by William Latimer and Thomas Linacre, graduating with a BA on 27 June 1515. In February 1518, King Henry VIII granted him the deanery of Wimborne Minster, Dorset; after which he was Prebendary of Salisbury and Dean of Exeter in 1527. He was also a canon in York, and had several other livings, although he had not been ordained a priest. Assisted by Bishop Edward Foxe, he represented Henry VIII in Paris in 1529, researching general opinions among theologians of the Sorbonne about the annulment of Henry's marriage with Catherine of Aragon. In 1521, Pole went to the University of Padua, where he met leading Renaissance figures, including Pietro Bembo, Gianmatteo Giberti (formerly Pope Leo X's datary and chief minister), Jacopo Sadoleto, Gianpietro Carafa (the future Pope Paul IV), Rodolfo Pio, Otto Truchsess, Stanislaus Hosius, Cristoforo Madruzzo, Giovanni Morone, Pier Paolo Vergerio the younger, Peter Martyr Vermigli and Vettor Soranzo. The last three were eventually condemned as heretics by the Catholic Church, with Vermigli‚Äîas a well-known Protestant theologian‚Äîhaving a significant share in the Reformation in Pole's native England. Pole's studies in Padua were partly financed by his election as a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, with more than half of the cost paid by Henry VIII himself on 14 February 1523, which allowed him to study abroad for three years.  Pole and Henry VIII  Pole returned home in July 1526, when he went to France, escorted by Thomas Lupset. Henry VIII offered him the Archbishopric of York or the Diocese of Winchester if he would support the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Pole withheld his support and went into self-imposed exile in France and Italy in 1532, where he continued his studies in Padua and Paris. After his return he held the benefice of vicar of Piddletown, Dorset, between 20 December 1532 and about January 1535/1536. In May 1536, Reginald Pole finally and decisively broke with the King. In 1531, he had warned of the dangers of the Boleyn marriage; he had returned to Padua in 1532, and received a last English benefice in December. Eustace Chapuys, the imperial ambassador to England, had suggested to Emperor Charles V that Pole marry Henry's daughter Mary and combine their dynastic claims; Chapuys also communicated with Reginald through his brother Geoffrey. At this time Pole was not definitively in Holy Orders. The final break between Pole and Henry followed upon Thomas Cromwell, Cuthbert Tunstall, Thomas Starkey and others addressing questions to Pole on behalf of Henry. He answered by sending the king a copy of his published treatise Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione, which, besides being a theological reply to the questions, was a strong denunciation of the king's policies that denied Henry's position on the marriage of a brother's widow and denied the royal supremacy; Pole also urged the princes of Europe to depose Henry immediately. Henry wrote to Pole's mother, the Countess of Salisbury, who in turn sent her son a letter reproving him for his \\"folly\\".ODNB, \\"Reginald Pole\\"; \\"Geoffrey Pole\\". Pole and his hagiographers gave several later accounts of Pole's activities after Henry met Anne Boleyn. These are not consistent; and if ‚Äì as he claimed at one point ‚Äì Pole rejected the annulment in 1526 and refused the Oath of Supremacy in 1531, he received benefits from Henry for a course of action for which others were sentenced to death.

He also became papal legate to England in February 1536/1537. Pope Paul III put him in charge of organising assistance for the Pilgrimage of Grace (and related movements), an effort to organise a march on London to demand Henry replace his ‚Äòreformist‚Äô advisers with more traditional, Catholic minds; neither Francis I of France nor the Emperor supported this effort, and the English government tried to have Pole assassinated. In 1539, Pole was sent to the Emperor to organise an embargo against England ‚Äì the sort of countermeasure he had himself warned Henry was possible. The king, with Pole himself out of his reach, took revenge on Pole's family for engaging in treason by word against the king. This later became known as the Exeter Conspiracy. The leading members were arrested, and all their properties seized. The action destroyed the Pole family.Ronald Fritze, ed., 'Historical Dictionary of Tudor England, 1485-1603 (1991) pp. 191-92. Sir Geoffrey Pole was arrested in August 1538; he had been corresponding with Reginald, and the investigation of Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter (Henry VIII's first cousin and the Countess of Salisbury's second cousin) had turned up his name; he had appealed to Thomas Cromwell, who had him arrested and interrogated. Under interrogation, Sir Geoffrey said that Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, and Exeter had all been parties to his correspondence with Reginald. Montagu, Exeter, and Lady Salisbury were arrested in November 1538, together with Henry Pole and other family members, on charges of treason, although Cromwell had previously written that they had \\"little offended save that he [Reginald Pole] is of their kin\\". They were committed to the Tower of London and, with the exception of Geoffrey Pole, they were all eventually executed. In January 1539, Sir Geoffrey was pardoned, and Montagu and Exeter were tried and executed for treason, while Reginald Pole was attainted in absentia. In May 1539, Montagu, Exeter, Lady Salisbury, and others were also attainted, as her father had been; this meant that they lost their lands ‚Äì mostly in the South of England, conveniently located to assist any invasion according to the crown ‚Äì and titles, and those still alive in the Tower were also sentenced to death, so could be executed at the King's will. As part of the evidence given in support of the Bill of Attainder, Cromwell produced a tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, symbolising Lady Salisbury's support of traditional Catholicism; the supposed discovery, six months after her house and effects had been searched when she was arrested, is likely to be a fabrication. Margaret Pole was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years under severe conditions; she, her grandson (Montagu's son), and Exeter's son were held together and supported by the King. In 1540, Cromwell himself fell from favour and was himself executed and attainted. She was finally executed in 1541, protesting her innocence until the last ‚Äì a highly publicised case which was considered a grave miscarriage of justice both at the time and later. Pole is known to have said that he would \\"never fear to call himself the son of a martyr\\". Some 350 years later, in 1886, Margaret was beatified by Pope Leo XIII. Aside from the aforementioned oppositional treatise, King Henry's harshness towards the Pole family might have derived from the fact that Pole's mother, Margaret, was one of the last surviving members of the House of Plantagenet. Under some circumstances, that descent could have made Reginald ‚Äì until he definitely entered the clergy ‚Äì a possible contender for the throne itself. In 1542 he was appointed as one of the three papal legates to preside over the Council of Trent, in 1549 he was appointed by Pope Paul III abbot of Gavello or Canalnuovo, and after the death of Pope Paul III in 1549 Pole, at one point, had nearly the two-thirds of the vote he needed to become pope himself at the papal conclave of 1549‚Äì50. His personal belief in justification by faith over works had caused him problems at Trent and accusations of heresy at the conclave. Thomas Hoby, visiting Rome to be present during the conclave, recorded that Pole failed to be elected 'by the Cardinall of Ferrara his meanes the voice of manie cardinalls of the French partie, persuading them that Cardinall Pole was both Imperiall and also a verie Lutherian'. Edward Chaney, The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance (London, 2nd ed. 2000), pp. 64, 92 and 109  Later years  Pole as a cardinal The death of Edward VI on 6 July 1553 and the accession of Mary I to the throne of England hastened Pole's return from exile, as papal legate to England (which he served as until 1557). In 1554, Cardinal Pole came to England to receive the kingdom back into the Catholic fold. However, Queen Mary I and Emperor Charles V delayed him until 20 November 1554, due to apprehension that Pole might oppose Mary's forthcoming marriage to Charles's son, Philip of Spain. As Papal Legate, Pole negotiated a papal dispensation allowing the new owners of confiscated former monastic lands to retain them, and in return Parliament enabled the Revival of the Heresy Acts in January 1555. This revived former measures against heresy: the letters patent of 1382 of Richard II, an Act of 1401 of Henry IV, and an Act of 1414 of Henry V. All of these had been repealed under Henry VIII and Edward VI. On 13 November 1555, Thomas Cranmer was officially deprived of the See of Canterbury. The Pope appointed Pole a cardinal-priest and administrator of the See of Canterbury on 11 December 1555. Under Mary's rule, Pole, whose attainder was reversed in 1554, was finally ordained as a priest on 20 March 1556 and consecrated as archbishop of Canterbury two days later, an office he would hold until his death. He was also chancellor of both Oxford and Cambridge universities in 1555 and 1555/1556 respectively. As well as his religious duties, he was in effect the Queen's chief minister and adviser. Many former enemies, including Cranmer, signed recantations affirming their religious belief in transubstantiation and papal supremacy. Despite this, which should have absolved them under Mary's own Revival of the Heresy Acts, the Queen could not forget their responsibility for the annulment of her mother's marriage. In 1555, Queen Mary began permitting the burning of Protestants for heresy, and some 220 men and 60 women were executed before her death in 1558. These persecutions contributed to the ultimate victory of the English Reformation, though Pole's involvement in these heresy trials is disputed. Pole was in failing health during the worst period of persecution, and there is some evidence that he favoured a more lenient approach: \\"Three condemned heretics from Bonner's diocese were pardoned on an appeal to him; he merely enjoined a penance and gave them absolution.\\" As the reign wore on, an increasing number of people turned against Mary and her government, and some people who had been indifferent to the English Reformation began turning against Catholicism. Writings such as John Foxe's 1568 Book of Martyrs, which emphasised the sufferings of the reformers under Mary, helped shape popular opinion against Catholicism in England for generations. Pole's tomb at Canterbury Cathedral Pole died in London, during an influenza epidemic, on 17 November 1558, at about 7:00 pm, nearly 12 hours after Queen Mary's death.p. 24 May 9 History Today, an excerpted article taken from Eamon Duffy's \\"Fires of Faith: Catholic England under Mary Tudor,\\" published by Yale University Press- History Today Vol 59 (5) May 2009, pp 24‚Äì29 He was buried on the north side of the Corona at Canterbury Cathedral.  Author  Pole was the author of De Concilio and of treatises on the authority of the pope and the Anglican Reformation of England, and of many important letters, full of interest for the history of the time, edited by Angelo Maria Quirini.five volumes, Brescia, 1744‚Äì57 He is known for his strong condemnation of Machiavelli's book The Prince, which he read in Italy, and on which he commented: \\"I found this type of book to be written by an enemy of the human race.

Dwyer  In popular culture  Cardinal Pole is a major character in the historical novels The Time Before You Die by Lucy Beckett and The Trusted Servant by Alison Macleod, and features in Hilary Mantel's novel The Mirror and the Light, the third and last of her novels on the life of Thomas Cromwell. In Season 3 of Showtime's series The Tudors, Cardinal Pole is portrayed by Canadian actor Mark Hildreth. In the mini-series The Virgin Queen he is played by Michael Feast; he is last seen leading Mary's servants out of Greenwich Palace as Elizabeth I arrives as queen.

This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names. A surname, family name, or last name is the portion (in some cultures) of a personal name that indicates a person's family (or tribe or community, depending on the culture). Depending on the culture, the family name may be placed at either the start of a person's full name, as the forename, or at the end; the number of surnames given to an individual also varies between cultures. As the surname indicates genetic inheritance, all members of a family unit may have identical surnames or there may be variations based on the cultural rules. Using names has been documented in even the oldest historical records. Examples of 'surnames' are documented in the 11th century by the barons in England. Surnames began as a way of identifying a certain aspect of that individual, such as by trade, father's name, location of birth, or physical features. It was not until the 15th century that surnames were used to denote inheritance, and today many cultures continue to use surnames as a regular practise, however this is not universal across all cultures. For those cultures that do use surnames, it is common to see two or more words in a surname, such as in compound surnames. Compound surnames can be composed of separate names, such as in traditional Spanish culture, they can be hyphenated together, or may contain prefixes.  Cultural differences  In the English-speaking world, a surname is commonly referred to as a last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's full name, after any given names. In many parts of Asia, as well as some parts of Europe and Africa, the family name is placed before a person's given name. In most Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking countries, two surnames are commonly used and in some families even three or more are used (often due to a family claim to nobility). Surnames have not always existed and today are not universal in all cultures. This tradition has arisen separately in different cultures around the world. In Europe, the concept of surnames became popular in the Roman Empire and expanded throughout the Mediterranean and Western Europe as a result. During the Middle Ages this practice died out as Germanic, Persian, and other influences took hold. During the late Middle Ages surnames gradually re-emerged, first in the form of bynames (typically indicating an individual's occupation or area of residence) and gradually evolving into modern surnames. In China surnames have been the norm since at least the 2nd century BC. A family name is typically a part of a person's personal name which, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from one or both of their parents' family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, with each culture having its own rules as to how these names are formed, passed and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is far from universal (see ¬ßHistory below). In many cultures, it is common for people to have one name or mononym, with some cultures not using family names. In most Slavic countries, as well as other countries including Greece, Lithuania and Latvia, for example, there are different family name forms for male and female members of the family. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a newborn child, on the adoption of a common family name on marriage, on renouncing of a family name and on changing of a family name. Surname laws vary around the world. Traditionally in many European countries for the past few hundred years, it was the custom or law that a woman would, upon marriage, use the surname of her husband, and that any children born would bear the father's surname. If a child's paternity was not known, or if the putative father denied paternity, the new-born child would have the surname of the mother. That is still the custom or law in many countries. The surname for children of married parents is usually inherited from the father.Kelly, 99 W Va L Rev at 10; see id. at 10 n 25 (The custom of taking the father's surname assumes that the child is born to parents in a \\"state-sanctioned marriage.\\" The custom is different for children born to unmarried parents.). Cited in Doherty v. Wizner, Oregon Court of Appeals (2005) In recent years there has been a trend towards equality of treatment in relation to family names, with women being not automatically required or expected, or in some places even forbidden, to take the husband's surname on marriage, and children not automatically being given the father's surname. In this article, family name and surname both mean the patrilineal surname, handed down from or inherited from the father, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, the term \\"maternal surname\\" means the patrilineal surname which one's mother inherited from either or both of her parents. For a discussion of matrilineal ('mother-line') surnames, passing from mothers to daughters, see matrilineal surname. It is common for women in the entertainment industry (like celebrities) to keep their maiden name after they get married, especially if they achieved their fame before marriage. The same can be said for women who achieved their fame during a previous marriage; For example: Kris Jenner (born Kris Houghton) was married to her second spouse Caitlyn Jenner when she rose to prominence in the reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians and singer Britney Spears has been married twice after she rose to prominence, but she still used her maiden name while married. In English-speaking cultures, family names are often used by children when referring to adults but are also used to refer to someone in authority, the elderly, or in a formal setting, and are often used with a title or honorific such as Mr., Mrs., Ms., Miss, Doctor, and so on. Generally the given name is the one used by friends, family, and other intimates to address an individual. It may also be used by someone who is in some way senior to the person being addressed. This practice also differs between cultures; see T‚ÄìV distinction. The study of proper names (in family names, personal names, or places) is called onomastics. A one-name study is a collection of vital and other biographical data about all persons worldwide sharing a particular surname.  Order of names  In many cultures (particularly in European and European-influenced cultures in the Americas, Oceania, etc., as well as West Asia/North Africa, South Asia, and most Sub- Saharan African cultures), the surname or family name (\\"last name\\") is placed after the personal, forename (in Europe) or given name (\\"first name\\"). In other cultures the surname is placed first, followed by the given name or names. The latter is often called the Eastern naming order because Europeans are most familiar with the examples from the East Asian cultural sphere, specifically, Greater China, Korea (Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Japan, and Vietnam. This is also the case in Cambodia, Laos, parts of South India, Sri Lanka, and Madagascar. But there are parts of Europe that also follow the Eastern Order, such as Hungary, Austria and adjacent areas of Germany (that is, Bavaria), Albania, Kosovo, and Romania. Since family names are normally written last in European societies, the terms last name or surname are commonly used for the family name, while in Japan (with vertical writing) the family name may be referred to as upper name (). When people from areas using Eastern naming order write their personal name in the Latin alphabet, it is common to reverse the order of the given and family names for the convenience of Westerners, so that they know which name is the family name for official/formal purposes. Reversing the order of names for the same reason is also customary for the Baltic Fennic peoples and the Hungarians, but other Uralic peoples traditionally did not have surnames, perhaps because of the clan structure of their societies. The Samis saw no change or a transformation of their name. For example: some Sire became Siri, H√¶tta J√°hko≈° √Åsslat became Aslak Jacobsen H√¶tta ‚Äî as was the norm. Recently, integration into the EU and increased communications with foreigners prompted many Samis to reverse the order of their full name to given name followed by surname, to avoid their given name being mistaken for and used as a surname. Indian surnames may often denote caste, profession, and village and are invariably mentioned along with the personal names. However, hereditary last names are not universal. In Indian passports the surname is shown first. In telephone directories the surname is used for collation. In North Indian states the surname is placed after given names where it exists. In parts of south India, especially in Telugu-speaking families, surname is placed before personal name and in most cases it is only shown as an initial (for example 'S.' for Suryapeth). In English and other languages like Spanish‚Äîalthough the usual order of names is \\"first middle last\\"‚Äîfor the purpose of cataloging in libraries and in citing the names of authors in scholarly papers, the order is changed to \\"last, first middle,\\" with the last and first names separated by a comma, and items are alphabetized by the last name.\\"Filing Rules\\" on the American Library Association website\\"MLA Works Cited Page: Basic Format\\" on the Purdue Online Writing Lab website, Purdue University In France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Latin America, administrative usage is to put the surname before the first on official documents.  History  While the use of given names to identify individuals is attested in the oldest historical records, the advent of surnames is a relatively recent phenomenon.

A four-year study led by the University of the West of England, which concluded in 2016, analysed sources dating from the 11th to the 19th century to explain the origins of the surnames in the British Isles. The study found that over 90% of the 45,602 surnames in the dictionary are native to Britain and Ireland, with the most common in the UK being Smith, Jones, Williams, Brown, Taylor, Davies, and Wilson. The findings have been published in the Oxford English Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland, with project leader, Professor Richard Coates calling the study \\"more detailed and accurate\\" than those before. He elaborated on the origins; \\"Some surnames have origins that are occupational ‚Äì obvious examples are Smith and Baker. Other names can be linked to a place, for example Hill or Green, which relates to a village green. Surnames which are 'patronymic' are those which originally enshrined the father's name ‚Äì such as Jackson, or Jenkinson. There are also names where the origin describes the original bearer such as Brown, Short, or Thin ‚Äì though Short may in fact be an ironic 'nickname' surname for a tall person.\\" By 1400, most English and some Scottish people used surnames, but many Scottish and Welsh people did not adopt surnames until the 17th century, or later. Henry VIII (ruled 1509‚Äì1547) ordered that marital births be recorded under the surname of the father. In England and cultures derived from there, there has long been a tradition for a woman to change her surname upon marriage from her birth name to her husband's family name. (See Maiden and married names.) The first known instance in the United States of a woman insisting on the use of her birth name was that of Lucy Stone in 1855; and there has been a general increase in the rate of women using their birth name. This has gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women. As of 2006, more than 80% of American women adopted the husband's family name after marriage.\\"American Women, Changing Their Names\\", National Public Radio. Retrieved 10 April 2013. Many cultures have used and continue to use additional descriptive terms in identifying individuals. These terms may indicate personal attributes, location of origin, occupation, parentage, patronage, adoption, or clan affiliation. These descriptors often developed into fixed clan identifications that in turn became family names as we know them today. In China, according to legend, family names started with Emperor Fu Xi in 2852 BC. His administration standardised the naming system in order to facilitate census-taking, and the use of census information. Originally, Chinese surnames were derived matrilineally,linguistics.berkeley.edu (2004). http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/~rosemary/55-2004-names.pdf, \\"Naming practices\\". A PDF file with a section on \\"Chinese naming practices (Mak et al., 2003)\\". Archived at WebCite https://www.webcitation.org/5xd5YvhE3?url=http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/%7Erosemary/55-2004-names.pdf on 1Apr11. although by the time of the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BCE) they had become patrilineal. (The first few sentences are accessible online via JSTOR at https://www.jstor.org/stable/2743616, i.e., p.753.) Chinese women do not change their names upon marriage. They can be referred to either as their full birth names or as their husband's surname plus the word for wife. In the past, women's given names were often not publicly known and women were referred in official documents by their family name plus the character \\"Shi\\" and when married by their husband's surname, their birth surname, and the character \\"Shi\\". In Japan, family names were uncommon except among the aristocracy until the 19th century. In Ancient Greece, during some periods, formal identification commonly included place of origin. At other times clan names and patronymics (\\"son of\\") were also common, as in Aristides Lysimachu. For example, Alexander the Great was known as Heracleides, as a supposed descendant of Heracles, and by the dynastic name Karanos/Caranus, which referred to the founder of the dynasty to which he belonged. In none of these cases, though, were these names considered essential parts of the person's name, nor were they explicitly inherited in the manner that is common in many cultures today. In the Roman Empire, the bestowal and use of clan and family names waxed and waned with changes in the various subcultures of the realm. (See Roman naming conventions.) The nomen, which was the gens name, was inherited much like last names are, but their purposes were quite different. In later Europe, last names were developed to distinguish between individuals. The nomen were to identify group kinship. The praenomen was the \\"forename\\" and was originally used like a first name today. In later times, praenomen became less useful for distinguishing individuals as it was often passed down for males along with the nomen (like an entire culture where \\"John Smith, Jr.\\" was the norm), and females, were often given no praenomen at all or functional names like Major and Minor (\\"Older\\" and \\"Younger\\") or Maxima, Maio, and Mino (\\"Biggest,\\" \\"Middle,\\" \\"Littlest\\") or ordinal numbers rather than what we might think of as names: Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, etc. Around this time, the nomen became followed by one or more additional names called cognomen. It became usual that one of these cognomen was inherited, but as the praenomen and nomen became more rigidly used and less useful for identifying individuals, additional personal cognomen were more often used, to the point that the first the praenomen and then the nomen fell out of use entirely. With the gradual influence of Greek and Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes put in front of traditional cognomen, but eventually, people reverted to single names. By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the Eastern Roman Empire. In Western Europe, where Germanic culture dominated the aristocracy, family names were almost non-existent. They would not significantly reappear again in Eastern Roman society until the 10th century, apparently influenced by the familial affiliations of the Armenian military aristocracy. The practice of using family names spread through the Eastern Roman Empire and gradually into Western Europe, although it was not until the modern era that family names came to be explicitly inherited as they are today. In Ireland, the use of surnames has a very old history. Ireland was the first country in Europe to use fixed surnames. In England, the introduction of family names is generally attributed to the preparation of the Domesday Book in 1086, following the Norman conquest. Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by affixing 'de' (of) before the name of their village in France. This is what is known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. In medieval times in France, such a name indicated lordship, or ownership, of the village. Some early Norman nobles in England chose to drop the French derivations and call themselves instead after their new English holdings. Surnames were uncommon prior to the 12th century, and still somewhat rare into the 13th; most European surnames were originally occupational or locational, and served to distinguish one person from another if they happened to live near one another (e.g., two different people named John could conceivably be identified as 'John Butcher' and 'John Chandler'). This still happens, in some communities where a surname is particularly common. In the Middle Ages, when a man from a lower-status family married an only daughter from a higher-status family, he would often adopt the wife's family name. In the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, bequests were sometimes made contingent upon a man's changing (or hyphenating) his family name, so that the name of the testator continued. It is rare but not unknown for an English-speaking man to take his wife's family name, whether for personal reasons or as a matter of tradition (such as among matrilineal Canadian aboriginal groups, such as the Haida and Gitxsan); it is exceedingly rare but does occur in the United States, where a married couple may choose an entirely new last name by going through a legal change of name. As an alternative, both spouses may adopt a double-barrelled name. For instance, when John Smith and Mary Jones marry each other, they may become known as \\"John Smith-Jones\\" and \\"Mary Smith-Jones\\". A spouse may also opt to use their birth name as a middle name. An additional option, although rarely practiced, is the adoption of a last name derived from a blend of the prior names, such as \\"Simones\\", which also requires a legal name change. Some couples keep their own last names but give their children hyphenated or combined surnames.Daniella Miletic (20 July 2012) Most women say 'I do' to husband's name. The Age. In medieval Spain, a patronymic system was used. For example, √Ålvaro, the son of Rodrigo would be named √Ålvaro Rodr√≠guez. His son, Juan, would not be named Juan Rodr√≠guez, but Juan √Ålvarez. Over time, many of these patronymics became family names and are some of the most common names in the Spanish-speaking world. Other sources of surnames are personal appearance or habit, e.g. Delgado (\\"thin\\") and Moreno (\\"dark\\"); geographic location or ethnicity, e.g. Alem√°n (\\"German\\"); or occupations, e.g. Molinero (\\"miller\\"), Zapatero (\\"shoe-maker\\") and Guerrero (\\"warrior\\"), although occupational names are much more often found in a shortened form referring to the trade itself, e.g. Molina (\\"mill\\"), Guerra (\\"war\\"), or Zapata (archaic form of zapato, \\"shoe\\"). = Modern era = During the modern era, many cultures around the world adopted family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the age of European expansion and particularly since 1600. Notable examples include the Netherlands (1795‚Äì1811), Japan (1870s), Thailand (1920), and Turkey (1934). Nonetheless, their use is not universal: Icelanders, Burmese, Javanese, and many people groups in East Africa do not use family names. Family names sometimes change or are replaced by non-family- name surnames under political pressure to avoid persecution. Examples are the cases with Chinese Indonesians and Chinese Thais after migration there during the 20th century, or the Jews who fled to different European countries to avoid persecution from the Nazis during World War II. The United States followed the naming customs and practices of English common law and traditions until recent times. Beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, traditional naming practices, writes one commentator, were recognized as \\"com[ing] into conflict with current sensitivities about children's and women's rights\\".Richard H. Thornton, The Controversy Over Children's Surnames: Familial Autonomy, Equal Protection and the Child's Best Interests, 1979 Utah L Rev 303. Those changes accelerated a shift away from the interests of the parents to a focus on the best interests of the child. The law in this area continues to evolve today mainly in the context of paternity and custody actions.Joanna Grossman, Whose Surname Should a Child Have, FindLaw's Writ column (12 August 2003), (last visited 7 December 2006). Upon marriage to a woman, men in the United States can easily change their surnames to that of their wives, or adopt a combination of both names with the federal government, through the Social Security Administration. Men may face difficulty doing so on the state level in some states. In some places, civil rights lawsuits or constitutional amendments changed the law so that men could also easily change their married names (e.g., in British Columbia and California). Qu√©bec law permits neither spouse to change surnames.Qu√©bec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name , by Marianne White, CanWest News Service, 8 August 2007 . Retrieved 3 November 2013. = UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women = In 1979, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (\\"CEDAW\\"), which declared in effect that women and men, and specifically wife and husband, shall have the same rights to choose a \\"family name\\", as well as a profession and an occupation.UN Convention, 1979. \\"Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women\\". Archived at WebCite on 1 Apri1 2011. For a further description of and treatment of this convention, see Matriname. In France, until 1 January 2005, children were required by law to take the surname of their father. Article 311-21 of the French Civil code now permits parents to give their children the family name of either their father, mother, or a hyphenation of both ‚Äì although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, the father's name applies. This brought France into line with a 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requiring member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was echoed by the United Nations in 1979. Similar measures were adopted by West Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983) and Spain (1999). The European Community has been active in eliminating gender discrimination. Several cases concerning discrimination in family names have reached the courts. Burghartz v. Switzerland challenged the lack of an option for husbands to add the wife's surname to his surname, which they had chosen as the family name, when this option was available for women.Burghartz v. Switzerland, no. 16213/90, 22 February 1994. Losonci Rose and Rose v. Switzerland challenged a prohibition on foreign men married to Swiss women keeping their surname if this option was provided in their national law, an option available to women.Losonci Rose and Rose v. Switzerland, no. 664/06, 9 November 2010. √únal Tekeli v. Turkey challenged prohibitions on women using their surname as the family name, an option only available to men.√únal Tekeli v Turkey, no. 29865/96, 16 November 2004. The Court found all these laws to be in violation of the convention. = Classification of European Surnames = Basil Cottle classifies European surnames under four broad categories, depending on their origin: given name (patronymics), occupational name, local name (toponymics), and nickname.Cottle, Basil. Penguin Dictionary of Surnames. Baltimore, MD: Penguin Books, 1967. No ISBN. This classification can be extended to surnames originating elsewhere. Other name etymologists use a fuller classification, but these four types underlie them.  Derived from a given name  These are the oldest and most common type of surname. They may be a first name such as \\"Wilhelm\\", a patronymic such as \\"Andersen\\", a matronymic such as \\"Beaton\\", or a clan name such as \\"O'Brien\\". Multiple surnames may be derived from a single given name: e.g. there are thought to be over 90 Italian surnames based on the given name \\"Giovanni\\".Hanks, Patrick and Hodges, Flavia. A Dictionary of Surnames. Oxford University Press, 1989. . A family tree showing the Icelandic patronymic naming system. The Icelandic system, formerly used in much of Scandinavia, does not use family names. A person's last name indicates the first name of their father (patronymic) or in some cases mother (matronymic). Many common family names in other Scandinavian countries are a result of this naming practice, such as Hansen (son of Hans), Johansen (son of Johan) and Olsen (son of Ole/Ola), the three most common surnames in Norway.Statistics Norway name statistics, 2009 This also occurs in other cultures: Spanish and Portuguese (L√≥pez or Lopes, son of Lope; √Ålvarez or √Ålvares, son of √Ålvaro; Dom√≠nguez or Domingues, son of Domingo or Domingos; etc.); Armenian (Gregoryan, son of Gregor; Petrossyan, son of Petros; etc.); in English (Johnson, son of John; Richardson, son of Richard), etc. Patronymic name conventions are similar in some other nations, including Malaysia (see Malaysian name) and other Muslim countries, among most people of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala (unlike another Indian state Andhra Pradesh, where ancestral origin village names have become surnames for the people), in Mongolia and in the Scottish Gaelic personal naming system. In Russia and Bulgaria, both patronymic and family name are obligatory parts of one's full name: e.g. if a Russian is called Ivan Andreyevich Sergeyev, that means that his father's name is Andrey and his family name is Sergeyev. A similar system is used in Greece. In Ethiopia and Eritrea, a child adopts the given name of one of their parents, usually the father, as a pseudo-surname. For example, Abraham Mesfin's father's first name would have been Mesfin, while Abraham Mesfin's child might be called \\"Netsanet Abraham\\". Just as in Iceland, referring to Abraham Mesfin as \\"Mr Mesfin\\" would be erroneous: the correct term would be \\"Mr Abraham\\". Very rarely do children adopt their mother's given name, who in any case would retain their \\"pseudo-surname\\". In traditional Hebrew patronymic names, a male's given name is followed by ben (, son of), and the father's name, e.g. Ben Adam () or Abraham ben Abraham. A woman's given name is similarly followed by bath, \\"daughter of\\" (also transcribed as bat), as in \\"Elishevah bath Shemuel,\\" where Elishevah's father's given name is Shemuel. Ben also forms part of Hebrew names, e.g. Benjamin. Some modern Israeli last names are formed by using the Aramaic version of ben, Bar-, e.g. Meir Bar-Ilan. In Israel, traditional patronymic forms have become European- style patrilineal surnames. For example, Yoram ben Yehudah or Hannah Bar-Ilan may not be literally the son and daughter of Yehudah and Ilan, but rather the male and female descendants of men called, respectively, ben Yehudah and Bar- Ilan. * Patronymics, matronymics or ancestral, often from a person's given name. e.g., from male name: Richardson, Stephenson, Jones (Welsh for John), Williams, Jackson, Wilson, Thompson, Benson, Johnson, Harris, Evans, Simpson, Willis, Fox, Davies, Reynolds, Adams, Dawson, Lewis, Rogers, Murphy, Morrow, Nicholson, Robinson, Powell, Ferguson, Davis, Edwards, Hudson, Roberts, Harrison, Watson, or female names Molson (from Moll for Mary), Madison (from Maud), Emmott (from Emma), Marriott (from Mary) or from a clan name (for those of Scottish origin, e.g., MacDonald, Forbes, Henderson, Armstrong, Grant, Cameron, Stewart, Douglas, Crawford, Campbell, Hunter) with \\"Mac\\" Gaelic for son.Katherine M. Spadaro, Katie Graham (2001) Colloquial Scottish Gaelic: the complete course for beginners p.16. Routledge, 2001 * Patronal from patronage (Hickman meaning Hick's man, where Hick is a pet form of the name Richard) or strong ties of religion Kilpatrick (follower of Patrick) or Kilbride (follower of Bridget). There is a wide range of family name affixes with a patronymic function. Some are prefixes (e.g., Gaelic mac) but more are suffixes. Occupational surname Occupational names include such simple examples as Smith (for a smith), Miller (for a miller), Farmer (for tax farmers or sometimes farmers), Thatcher (for a thatcher), Shepherd (for a shepherd), Potter (for a potter), and so on, as well as non-English ones, such as the German Eisenhauer (iron hewer, later Anglicized in America as Eisenhower) or Schneider (tailor) ‚Äì or, as in English, Schmidt (smith). There are also more complicated names based on occupational titles. In England it was common for servants to take a modified version of their employer's occupation or first name as their last name, adding the letter s to the word, although this formation could also be a patronymic. For instance, the surname Vickers is thought to have arisen as an occupational name adopted by the servant of a vicar,Reaney, P.H., and Wilson, R.M. A Dictionary of English Surnames. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. Rev. 3rd ed. . while Roberts could have been adopted by either the son or the servant of a man named Robert. A subset of occupational names in English are names thought to be derived from the medieval mystery plays. The participants would often play the same roles for life, passing the part down to their oldest sons. Names derived from this may include King, Lord and Virgin. The original meaning of names based on medieval occupations may no longer be obvious in modern English (so the surnames Cooper, Chandler, and Cutler come from the occupations of making barrels, candles, and cutlery, respectively). = Examples = Archer, Bailey, Bailhache, Baker, Brewer, Butcher, Carpenter, Carter, Chandler, Clark or Clarke, Collier, Cooper, Cook or Cooke, Dempster, Dyer, Farmer, Faulkner, Fisher, Fletcher, Fowler, Fuller, Gardener, Glover, Hayward, Hawkins, Head, Hunt or Hunter, Judge, Knight, Mason, Miller, Mower, Page, Palmer, Parker, Porter, Potter, Reeve or Reeves, Sawyer, Shoemaker, Slater, Smith, Stringer, Taylor, Thatcher, Turner, Walker, Weaver, Woodman and Wright (or variations such as Cartwright and Wainwright). Toponymic surname Location (toponymic, habitation) names derive from the inhabited location associated with the person given that name. Such locations can be any type of settlement, such as: homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds or cottages. One element of a habitation name may describe the type of settlement. Examples of Old English elements are frequently found in the second element of habitational names. The habitative elements in such names can differ in meaning, according to different periods, different locations, or with being used with certain other elements. For example, the Old English element t≈´n may have originally meant \\"enclosure\\" in one name, but can have meant \\"farmstead\\", \\"village\\", \\"manor\\", or \\"estate\\" in other names. Location names, or habitation names, may be as generic as \\"Monte\\" (Portuguese for \\"mountain\\"), \\"G√≥rski\\" (Polish for \\"hill\\") or \\"Pitt\\" (variant of \\"pit\\"), but may also refer to specific locations. \\"Washington\\", for instance, is thought to mean \\"the homestead of the family of Wassa\\", while \\"Lucci\\" means \\"resident of Lucca\\". Although some surnames, such as \\"London\\", \\"Lisboa\\", or \\"Bia≈Çystok\\" are derived from large cities, more people reflect the names of smaller communities, as in √ì Creachmhaoil, derived from a village in County Galway. This is thought to be due to the tendency in Europe during the Middle Ages for migration to chiefly be from smaller communities to the cities and the need for new arrivals to choose a defining surname.Bowman, William Dodgson. The Story of Surnames. London, George Routledge & Sons, Ltd., 1932. No ISBN. In Portuguese-speaking countries, it is uncommon, but not unprecedented, to find surnames derived from names of countries, such as Portugal, Fran√ßa, Brasil, Holanda. Surnames derived from country names are also found in English, such as \\"England\\", \\"Wales\\", \\"Spain\\". Many Japanese surnames derive from geographical features; for example, Ishikawa (Áü≥Â∑ù) means \\"stone river\\", Yamamoto (Â±±Êú¨) means \\"the base of the mountain\\", and Inoue (‰∫ï‰∏ä) means \\"above the well\\". Arabic names sometimes contain surnames that denote the city of origin. For example, in cases of Saddam Hussein al Tikriti, meaning Saddam Hussein originated from Tikrit, a city in Iraq. This component of the name is called a nisbah. * Habitation (place) names e.g., Burton, Hamilton, London, Leighton, Murray, Sutton, Flint, Laughton * Estate names For those descended from land-owners, the name of their holdings, castle, manor or estate, e.g. Ernle, Windsor, Staunton * Topographic names (geographical features) e.g., Bridge, Camp, Hill, Bush, Lake, Lee, Wood, Grove, Holmes, Forest, Underwood, Hall, Brook or Brooks, Fields, Stone, Morley, Moore, Perry Derived from a nickname This is the broadest class of surnames, encompassing many types of origin. These include names, also known as eke-names,\\"Claro Family Crest and History\\" on the House of Names website based on appearance such as \\"Schwartzkopf\\", \\"Short\\", and possibly \\"Caesar\\", and names based on temperament and personality such as \\"Daft\\", \\"Gutman\\", and \\"Maiden\\", which, according to a number of sources, was an English nickname meaning \\"effeminate\\". * Personal characteristics e.g., Short, Brown, Black, Whitehead, Young, Long, White =Ornamental surname= Ornamental names used as surnames are more common in communities which adopted (or were forced to adopt) surnames in the 18th and 19th centuries. They occur commonly in Scandinavia, among Sinti and Roma and Jews in Germany and Austria. Examples include \\"Steinbach\\" (\\"derived from a place called Steinbach\\"), \\"Rosenberg\\" (\\"rose mountain\\"), and \\"Winterstein\\" (derived from a place called Winterstein). Forced adoption in 19th century is the source of German, Polish and even Italian ornamental surnames for Latvians such as \\"RozentƒÅls (Rosental)\\" (\\"rose valley\\"), \\"Eizenbaums (Eisenbaum\\") (\\"steel wood\\"), \\"Freibergs (Freiberg)\\" (\\"free mountain\\"). In some cases, such as Chinese Indonesians and Chinese Thais, certain ethnic groups are subject to political pressure to change their surnames, in which case surnames can lose their family-name meaning. For instance, Indonesian business tycoon Liem Swie Liong (ÊûóÁªçËâØ) \\"indonesianised\\" his name to Sudono Salim. In this case \\"Liem\\" (Êûó) was rendered by \\"Salim\\", a name of Arabic origin, while \\"Sudono\\", a Javanese name with the honorific prefix \\"su-\\" (of Sanskrit origin), was supposed to be a rendering of \\"Swie Liong\\". During the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade many Africans lost their native names and were forced by their owners to take the owners' surnames and any given name the \\"owner\\" or slave master desired. In the Americas, the family names of many African-Americans have their origins in slavery (i.e. slave name). Many of them came to bear the surnames of their former owners. Many freed slaves either created family names themselves or adopted the name of their former master. = Gender-specific versions of surname = In some cultures and languages, especially most of Slavic languages (such as Bulgarian, Russian, Slovak, Czech, etc.) and some other nations ‚Äì Greece, Iceland, Latvia and Lithuania ‚Äì surnames change form depending on the gender of the bearer. Some Slavic cultures distinguished originally daughter surnames from wife surnames by different suffixes, but this distinction is mostly abandoned. In Slavic languages, substantivized adjective surnames have commonly symmetrical adjective variants for males and females (Podwi≈Ñski/Podwi≈Ñska in Polish, Nov√Ω/Nov√° in Czech or Slovak etc.). In case of nominative and quasi-nominative surnames, the female variant is derived from the male variant by a possessive suffix (Nov√°k/Nov√°kov√°, Hromada/Hromadov√°). In Czech and Slovak, the pure possessive would be Nov√°kova, Hromadova, but the surname evoluted to a more adjectivized form Nov√°kov√°, Hromadov√°, to suppress the historical possessivity. Some rare types of surnames are universal and gender-neutral: in Czech language e.g. Jan≈Ø, Martin≈Ø, Fojt≈Ø, Kov√°≈ô≈Ø etc., which are archaic form of possessive, related to plural name of the family. Such rare surnames are also often used for transgender persons during transition, because most of common surnames are gender-specific. Some Czech dialects (Southwest-Bohemian) use the form \\"Nov√°kojc\\" as informal for both genders. In culture of Sorbs (Lusatians), Sorbian used different female form for unmarried daughters (Jordanojc, Nowcyc, Kuba≈°ec, Markulic), and different form for wives (Nowakowa, Budarka, Nowcyna, Markulina). In Polish, typical daughter surnames ended -√≥wna, -anka or -ianka, while wife surnames used possessive suffixes -ina or -owa. Informal dialectal female form in Polish and Czechs dialects was also -ka (Pawlaczka, Kube≈°ka). Polish language tends to abandon both form of feminized surnames. In Czech language, a trend to use male surnames for women is popular among cosmopolitans or celebrities, but is often criticized from patriotic views and can be seen as ridiculous and as degradation and disruption of Czech grammar. Adaptation of surnames of foreign women by suffix \\"-ov√°\\" is currently a hot linguistic and political question in Czechia; is massively advocated as well as criticized and opposed. Generally, inflected languages use names and surnames as living words, not as static identifiers. Thus, the pair or the family can be named by plural form which can differ from the singular male and female form. E.g., when the male form is Nov√°k and the female form Nov√°kov√°, the family name is Nov√°kovi in Czech and Nov√°kovci in Slovak. When male form is Hrub√Ω and female form is Hrub√°, the plural family name is Hrub√≠ (or \\"rodina Hrub√Ωch\\"). In Greece, if a man called Papadopoulos has a daughter, she will likely be named Papadopoulou (if the couple have decided their offspring will take his surname), the genitive form, as if the daughter is \\"of\\" a man named Papadopoulos. In Lithuania, if the husband is named Vilkas, his wife will be named Vilkienƒó and his daughter will be named Vilkaitƒó. Male surnames have suffixes -as, -is, -ius, or -us, unmarried girl surnames aitƒó, -ytƒó, -i≈´tƒó or -utƒó, wife surnames -ienƒó. Latvian uses strictly feminized surnames for women, even in case of foreign names. The function of the suffix is purely grammar. Male surnames ending -e or -a need not to be modified for women. An exception is: 1) the female surnames which correspond to nouns in the sixth declension with the ending \\"-s\\" ‚Äì \\"Iron\\", (\\"iron\\"), \\"rock\\", 2) as well as surnames of both genders, which are written in the same nominative case because corresponds to nouns in the third declension ending in \\"-us\\" \\"Grigus\\", \\"Markus\\"; 3) surnames based on an adjective have indefinite suffixes typical of adjectives \\"-s, -a\\" (\\"Stalts\\", \\"Stalta\\") or the specified endings \\"-ais, -ƒÅ\\" (\\"ƒåaklais\\", \\"ƒåaklƒÅ\\") (\\"diligent\\"). In Iceland, surnames have a gender- specific suffix (-d√≥ttir = daughter, -son = son). Finnish language used gender-specific sufix up to 1929, when the Marriage Act forced women to use the husband's form of surname. In 1985, this sentence was released from the act. = Other = The meanings of some names are unknown or unclear. The most common European name in this category may be the English (Irish derivative) name Ryan, which means 'little king' in Irish. Also, Celtic origin of the name Arthur, meaning 'bear'. Other surnames may have arisen from more than one source: the name De Luca, for instance, likely arose either in or near Lucania or in the family of someone named Lucas or Lucius; in some instances, however, the name may have arisen from Lucca, with the spelling and pronunciation changing over time and with emigration. The same name may appear in different cultures by coincidence or romanization; the surname Lee is used in English culture, but is also a romanization of the Chinese surname Li. Surname origins have been the subject of much folk etymology. In French Canada until the 19th century, several families adopted surnames that followed the family name in order to distinguish the various branches of a large family. Such a surname was preceded by the word dit ('so-called,' lit.'said') and was known as a nom- dit ('said-name'). (Compare with some Roman naming conventions.) While this tradition is no longer in use, in many cases the nom-dit has come to replace the original family name. Thus the Bourbeau family has split into Bourbeau dit Verville, Bourbeau dit Lacourse, and Bourbeau dit Beauchesne. In many cases Verville, Lacourse, or Beauchesne has become the new family name. Likewise, the Rivard family has split into the Rivard dit Lavigne, Rivard dit Loranger and Rivard dit Lanoie. The origin of the nom-dit can vary. Often it denoted a geographical trait of the area where that branch of the family lived: Verville lived towards the city, Beauchesne lived near an oak tree, Larivi√®re near a river, etc. Some of the oldest noms-dits are derived from the war name of a settler who served in the army or militia: Tranchemontagne ('mountain slasher'), Jolic≈ìur ('braveheart'). Others denote a personal trait: Lacourse might have been a fast runner, Legrand was probably tall, etc. Similar in German it is with \\"genannt\\" ‚Äì \\"Vietinghoff genannt Scheel\\".  Compound surnames  While in many countries surnames are usually one word, in others a surname may contain two words or more, as described below. = Spanish compound surnames = In traditional Spanish culture, and as is still the case in many Spanish-speaking countries, an individual does not have only a single surname. Instead an individual inherits the surnames of all of their ancestors, in particular their father and mother. In practice individuals mostly use only the two surnames of their parents. For instance, Spanish ex- premier Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero has Jos√© Luis as his given name, Rodr√≠guez as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Zapatero as his second (i.e. maternal) surname. But in reality an individual can be referred to by any number of his or her surnames as the occasion may require. For example, Rodr√≠guez Zapatero could also be referred to as :Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero Garc√≠a Valero Garc√≠a Asensio Additional surnames refer to grandmothers, great- grandmothers, and so forth. The number of surnames a person has is theoretically unlimited though it is rare to use more than a few (and indeed an individual may not know more than a few of his or her ancestors' names). This custom is not seen in the Hispanic world as being a true compound surname system per se, since it is widely understood that the first surname denotes one's father's family, and the second surname denotes one's mother's family. So \\"Rodr√≠guez Zapatero\\" is not considered one surname; it is two distinct surnames. Given that it is not a true compound surname, his children do not inherit the \\"compound\\" surname \\"Rodr√≠guez Zapatero\\". Only the paternal surname of both father and mother are passed on. The father's paternal surname becomes the child's own paternal surname, while the mother's paternal surname becomes the child's second surname (as the child's own maternal surname). Thus, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero would pass on only Rodr√≠guez to his children as their first (i.e. paternal) surname. An additional complication is introduced by marriage. Rodr√≠guez Zapatero's wife was born Sonsoles Espinosa D√≠az. Under Spanish tradition she is still known by that name, even after marriage. But she may also be known as :Sonsoles Espinosa D√≠az de Rodr√≠guez :Sonsoles Espinosa de Rodr√≠guez :Sonsoles de Rodr√≠guez These other forms, particularly the last, are becoming less common as they are increasingly seen as sexist (i.e. that a wife is expected to take her husband's name but not the other way around). Additionally, in Spain and some other countries it is becoming more common, in law and in practice, to allow placing the mother's name before the father's in a child's surname rather than insisting that the privilege belongs exclusively to the father.  True compound surnames  Beyond this seemingly \\"compound\\" surname system in the Hispanic world, there are also true compound surnames in the Spanish-speaking countries. These true compound surnames are passed on and inherited as compounds. For instance, former Chairman of the Supreme Military Junta of Ecuador, General Luis Telmo Paz y Mi√±o Estrella, has Luis as his first given name, Telmo as his middle name, the true compound surname Paz y Mi√±o as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Estrella as his second (i.e. maternal) surname. Luis Telmo Paz y Mi√±o Estrella is also known more casually as Luis Paz y Mi√±o, Telmo Paz y Mi√±o, or Luis Telmo Paz y Mi√±o. He would never be regarded as Luis Estrella, Telmo Estrella, or Luis Telmo Estrella, nor as Luis Paz, Telmo Paz, or Luis Telmo Paz. This is because \\"Paz\\" alone is not his surname (although other people use the \\"Paz\\" surname on its own). In this case, Paz y Mi√±o is in fact the paternal surname, being a true compound surname. His children, therefore, would inherit the compound surname \\"Paz y Mi√±o\\" as their paternal surname, while Estrella would be lost, since the mother's paternal surname becomes the children's second surname (as their own maternal surname). \\"Paz\\" alone would not be passed on, nor would \\"Mi√±o\\" alone. To avoid ambiguity, one might often informally see these true compound surnames hyphenated, for instance, as Paz- y-Mi√±o. This is true especially in the English-speaking world, but also sometimes even in the Hispanic world, since to many Hispanics unfamiliar with this and other compound surnames, \\"Paz y Mi√±o\\" might be inadvertently mistaken as \\"Paz\\" for the paternal surname and \\"Mi√±o\\" for the maternal surname. Although Mi√±o did start off as the maternal surname in this compound surname, it was many generations ago, around five centuries, that it became compounded, and henceforth inherited and passed on as a compound. Other surnames which started off as compounds of two or more surnames, but which merged into one single word, also exist. An example would be the surname Pazmi√±o, whose members are related to the Paz y Mi√±o, as both descend from the \\"Paz Mi√±o\\" family of five centuries ago. √Ålava, Spain is known for its incidence of true compound surnames, characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic (i.e. from the Castilian language) or more unusually a Basque language patronymic, followed by the preposition \\"de\\", with the second part of the surname being a local toponymic surname from √Ålava. = English compound surnames = Compound surnames in English and several other European cultures feature two (or occasionally more) words, often joined by a hyphen or hyphens. However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the British Conservative Party, whose surname is \\"Duncan Smith\\". A surname with the prefix \\"Fitz\\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, as in \\"Fitz William\\", as well as \\"FitzWilliam\\" or \\"Fitzwilliam\\". Like, for example, Robert FitzRoy. = Scottish and Irish compound surnames = Irish surnames are the oldest surnames in Europe. The common prefixes \\"√ì\\" and \\"Mac\\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, yielding \\"√ì Briain\\" or \\"Mac Millan\\" as well as the anglicized \\"O'Brien\\" and \\"MacMillan\\" or \\"Macmillan\\". = Chinese compound surnames = Some Chinese surnames use more than one character.  Culture and prevalence  Rank and frequency of some US surnames In the United States, 1,712 surnames cover 50% of the population, and about 1% of the population has the surname Smith,Genealogy , U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division (1995). which is also the most frequent English name and an occupational name (\\"metal worker\\"), a contraction, for instance, of blacksmith or other metalsmiths. Several American surnames are a result of corruptions or phonetic misappropriations of European surnames, perhaps as a result of the registration process at the immigration entry points. Spellings and pronunciations of names remained fluid in the United States until the Social Security System enforced standardization. Approximately 70% of Canadians have surnames that are of English, Irish, French, or Scottish derivation. According to some estimates, 85% of China's population shares just 100 surnames. The names Wang (Áéã), Zhang (Âº†) and Li (Êùé) are the most frequent.LaFraniere S. Name Not on Our List? Change It, China Says. New York Times. 20 April 2009.  Spanish-speaking world  In Spain and in most Spanish-speaking countries, the custom is for people to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from the father and the second from the mother, but it could be the other way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be the mother's first surname. For example, if Jos√© Garc√≠a Torres and Mar√≠a Acosta G√≥mez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo Garc√≠a Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames. In some instances, when an individual's given name and first family name are too common (such as in Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero and Mario Vargas Llosa), both family names are used (though not necessarily both given names). A person could even take the maternal name for informal situations instead of the paternal name, for personal preferences or if the maternal name is somehow \\"special\\" (Jos√© Lu√≠s Rodr√≠guez Zapatero is known in Spanish as \\"Jos√© Luis Zapatero\\" or just as \\"Zapatero\\"). In Spain, a new law approved in 1999 allows an adult to change the order of his/her family names, and parents can also change the order of their children's family names if they (and the child, if over 12) agree. Note: Google auto translation of title into English‚ÜíRoyal Decree 193/2000, of 11 February, to amend certain articles of the Civil Registration Regulations in the field on the name and order. In Spain, especially Catalonia, the paternal and maternal surnames are often combined using the conjunction y (\\"and\\" in Spanish) or i (\\"and\\" in Catalan), see for example the economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin or painter Salvador Dal√≠ i Dom√®nech. In Spain, a woman does not change her legal surnames when she marries. In some Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, a woman may, on her marriage, drop her mother's surname and add her husband's surname to her father's surname using the preposition de (\\"of\\"), del (\\"of the\\", when the following word is masculine) or de la (\\"of the\\", when the following word is feminine). For example, if \\"Clara Reyes Alba\\" were to marry \\"Alberto G√≥mez Rodr√≠guez\\", the wife could use \\"Clara Reyes de G√≥mez\\" as her name (or \\"Clara Reyes G√≥mez\\", or, rarely, \\"Clara G√≥mez Reyes\\". She can be addressed as Sra. de G√≥mez corresponding to \\"Mrs G√≥mez\\"). In some countries, this form may be mainly social and not an official name change, i.e. her name would still legally be her birth name. This custom of adding the husband's surname is slowly fading. Sometimes a father transmits his combined family names, thus creating a new one e.g., the paternal surname of the son of Javier (given name) Reyes (paternal family name) de la Barrera (maternal surname) may become the new paternal surname Reyes de la Barrera. De is also the nobiliary particle used with Spanish surnames. This can not be chosen by the person, as it is part of the surname, for example \\"Puente\\" and \\"Del Puente\\" are not the same surname. Children take the surnames of both parents, so if the couple above had two children named \\"Andr√©s\\" and \\"Ana\\", then their names would be \\"Andr√©s G√≥mez Reyes\\" and \\"Ana G√≥mez Reyes\\". In Spain, a 1995 reform in the law allows the parents to choose whether the father's or the mother's surname goes first, although this order must be the same for all their children. For instance, the name of the son of the couple in the example above could be either \\"Andr√©s G√≥mez Reyes\\" or \\"Andr√©s Reyes G√≥mez\\".Art. 55 Ley de Registro Civil ‚Äì Civil Register Law (article in Spanish) Sometimes, for single mothers or when the father would or could not recognize the child, the mother's surname has been used twice: for example, \\"Ana Reyes Reyes\\". In Spain, however, children with just one parent receive both surnames of that parent, although the order may also be changed. In 1973 in Chile, the law was changed to avoid stigmatizing illegitimate children with the maternal surname repeated. Some Hispanic people, after leaving their country, drop their maternal surname, even if not formally, so as to better fit into the non- Hispanic society they live or work in. Dropping the paternal surname is not unusual when it is a very common one. For instance, painter Pablo Ruiz Picasso and Spanish Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero are known by their maternal surnames as \\"Picasso\\" and \\"Zapatero\\". Similarly, Anglophones with just one surname may be asked to provide a second surname on official documents in Spanish-speaking countries. When none (such as the mother's maiden name) is provided, the last name may simply be repeated. Traditionally in most countries, and currently in some Spanish-speaking countries, women, upon marrying, keep their own family names. It is considered impolite towards her family for a woman to change her name. The higher class women of Cuba and Spain traditionally never change their names. In certain rare situations, a woman may be addressed with her paternal surname followed by her husband's paternal surname linked with de. For example, a woman named Ana Garc√≠a D√≠az, upon marrying Juan Guerrero Mac√≠as, could be called Ana Garc√≠a de Guerrero. This custom, begun in medieval times, is decaying and only has legal validity in Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru, Panama, and to a certain extent in Mexico (where it is optional but becoming obsolete), but is frowned upon by people in Spain, Cuba, and elsewhere. In Peru and the Dominican Republic, women normally conserve all family names after getting married. For example, if Rosa Mar√≠a P√©rez Mart√≠nez marries Juan Mart√≠n De la Cruz G√≥mez, she will be called Rosa Mar√≠a P√©rez Mart√≠nez de De la Cruz, and if the husband dies, she will be called Rosa Mar√≠a P√©rez Mart√≠nez Vda. de De la Cruz (Vda. being the abbreviation for viuda, \\"widow\\" in Spanish). The law in Peru changed some years ago, and all married women can keep their maiden last name if they wish with no alteration. In some churches, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where the family structure is emphasized, as well as legal marriage, the wife is referred to as \\"hermana\\" [sister] plus the surname of her husband. And most records of the church follow that structure as well. A new trend in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American born English-speakers are not aware of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the individual for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban √Ålvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban √Ålvarez Cobos, would become Esteban √Ålvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names. In Spanish villages in Catalonia, Galicia, and Asturias and in Cuba, people are often known by the name of their dwelling or collective family nickname rather than by their surnames. For example, Remei Pujol i Serra who lives at Ca l'Elvira would be referred to as \\"Remei de Ca l'Elvira\\"; and Adela Barreira L√≥pez who is part of the \\"Provisores\\" family would be known as \\"Adela dos Provisores\\". In the case of Cantabria the family's nickname is used instead of the surname: if one family is known as \\"√ëecos\\" because of an ancestor who was known as \\"√ëecu\\", they would be \\"Jos√© el de √ëecu\\" or \\"Ana la de √ëecu\\" (collective: the √ëeco's). Some common nicknames are \\"Rubiu\\" (blonde or ginger hair), \\"Roju\\" (reddish, as referred to ginger hair), \\"Chiqui\\" (small), \\"Jinchu\\" (big), and a bunch of names about certain characteristics, family relationship or geographical origin (pasiegu, masoniegu, sobanu, llebaniegu, tresmeranu, pejinu, naveru, merachu, tresneru, troule, mallavia, marotias, llamoso, lipa, √±ecu, tarugu, trapajeru, lich√≥n, andar√≠vel).  Portuguese-speaking countries  In the case of Portuguese naming customs, the main surname (the one used in alphasorting, indexing, abbreviations, and greetings), appears last. Each person usually has two family names: though the law specifies no order, the first one is usually the maternal family name, whereas the last one is commonly the paternal family name. In Portugal, a person's full name has a minimum legal length of two names (one given name and one family name from either parent) and a maximum of six names (two first names and four surnames ‚Äì he or she may have up to four surnames in any order desired picked up from the total of his/her parents and grandparents' surnames). The use of any surname outside this lot, or of more than six names, is legally possible, but it requires dealing with bureaucracy. Parents or the person him/herself must explain the claims they have to bearing that surname (a family nickname, a rare surname lost in past generations, or any other reason one may find suitable). In Brazil there is no limit of surnames used. In general, the traditions followed in countries like Brazil, Portugal and Angola are somewhat different from the ones in Spain. In the Spanish tradition, usually the father's surname comes first, followed by the mother's surname, whereas in Portuguese-speaking countries the father's name is the last, mother's coming first. A woman may adopt her husband's surname(s), but nevertheless she usually keeps her birth names, or at least the last one. Since 1977, a husband can also adopt his wife's surname. When this happens, usually both spouses change their name after marriage. The custom of a woman changing her name upon marriage is recent. It spread in the late 19th century in the upper classes, under French influence, and in the 20th century, particularly during the 1930s and 1940, it became socially almost obligatory. Nowadays, fewer women adopt, even officially, their husbands' names, and among those who do so officially, it is quite common not to use it either in their professional or informal life. The children usually bear only the last surnames of the parents (i.e., the paternal surname of each of their parents). For example, Carlos da Silva Gon√ßalves and Ana Lu√≠sa de Albuquerque Pereira (Gon√ßalves) (in case she adopted her husband's name after marriage) would have a child named Lucas Pereira Gon√ßalves. However, the child may have any other combination of the parents' surnames, according to euphony, social significance or other reasons. For example, is not uncommon for the first born male to be given the father's full name followed by \\"J√∫nior\\" or \\"Filho\\" (son), and the next generation's first born male to be given the grandfather's name followed by \\"Neto\\" (grandson). Hence Carlos da Silva Gon√ßalves might choose to name his first born son Carlos da Silva Gon√ßalves J√∫nior, who in turn might name his first born son Carlos da Silva Gon√ßalves Neto, in which case none of the mother's family names are passed on. In ancient times a patronymic was commonly used ‚Äì surnames like Gon√ßalves (\\"son of Gon√ßalo\\"), Fernandes (\\"son of Fernando\\"), Nunes (\\"son of Nuno\\"), Soares (\\"son of Soeiro\\"), Sanches (\\"son of Sancho\\"), Henriques (\\"son of Henrique\\"), Rodrigues (\\"son of Rodrigo\\") which along with many others are still in regular use as very prevalent family names. In Medieval times, Portuguese nobility started to use one of their estates' names or the name of the town or village they ruled as their surname, just after their patronymic. Soeiro Mendes da Maia bore a name \\"Soeiro\\", a patronymic \\"Mendes\\" (\\"son of Hermenegildo ‚Äì shortened to Mendo\\") and the name of the town he ruled \\"Maia\\". He was often referred to in 12th-century documents as \\"Soeiro Mendes, senhor da Maia\\", Soeiro Mendes, lord of Maia. Noblewomen also bore patronymics and surnames in the same manner and never bore their husband's surname. First-born males bore their father's surname, other children bore either both or only one of them at their will. Only during the Early Modern Age, lower-class males started to use at least one surname; married lower-class women usually took up their spouse's surname, since they rarely ever used one beforehand. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Portuguese authorities realized the benefits of enforcing the use and registry of surnames. Henceforth, they became mandatory, although the rules for their use were very liberal. Until the end of the 19th century it was common for women, especially those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only by their first names. A woman would then adopt her husband's full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames. During the mid-20th century, under French influence and among upper classes, women started to take up their husbands' surname(s). From the 1960s onwards, this usage spread to the common people, again under French influence, this time, however, due to the forceful legal adoption of their husbands' surname which was imposed onto Portuguese immigrant women in France. From the 1974 Carnation Revolution onwards the adoption of their husbands' surname(s) receded again, and today both the adoption and non-adoption occur, with non-adoption being chosen in the majority of cases in recent years (60%). Also, it is legally possible for the husband to adopt his wife's surname(s), but this practice is rare.

She was the daughter of George, Duke of Clarence, the brother of kings Edward IV and Richard III. Margaret was one of two women in 16th- century England to be a peeress in her own right with no titled husband.ODNB; the other was Anne Boleyn, Marquess of Pembroke. The ODNB does not qualify the assertion, but is discussing sixteenth-century usage; sources which apply modern law retroactively will consider some women peeresses in their own right when their husbands sat in Parliament with their father's style and precedence. One of the few surviving members of the Plantagenet dynasty after the Wars of the Roses, she was executed in 1541 at the command of Henry VIII, who was the son of her first cousin Elizabeth of York. Pope Leo XIII beatified her as a martyr for the Catholic Church on 29 December 1886.DWYER, J. G. \\"Pole, Margaret Plantagenet, Bl.\\" New Catholic Encyclopedia. 2nd ed. Vol. 11. Detroit: Gale, 2003. pp. 455‚Äì56. Early life Margaret was born at Farleigh Hungerford Castle in Somerset, the only surviving daughter of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and his wife Isabel Neville, who was the elder daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and his wife Anne de Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick. Her maternal grandfather was killed fighting against her uncle, Edward IV, at the Battle of Barnet. Her father, already Duke of Clarence, was then created Earl of Salisbury and of Warwick. Edward IV declared that Margaret's younger brother Edward should be known as Earl of Warwick as a courtesy title, but no peerage was ever created for him. Margaret would have had a claim to the Earldom of Warwick, but the earldom was forfeited on the attainder of her brother Edward.ODNB. Margaret's mother died when she was three, and her father had two servants killed whom he thought had poisoned her. George plotted against Edward IV, and was attainted and executed for treason; his lands and titles were forfeited. Edward IV died when Margaret was ten, and her uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester, declared that Edward's marriage was invalid, his children illegitimate, and that Margaret and her brother Edward were debarred from the throne by their father's attainder. Married to Anne Neville, younger sister to Margaret's mother Isabel, Richard assumed the throne himself as Richard III. Richard III sent the children to Sheriff Hutton Castle in Yorkshire. He was defeated and killed in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth by Henry Tudor, who succeeded him as Henry VII. The new king married Margaret's cousin Elizabeth of York, Edward IV's daughter, and Margaret and her brother were taken into their care. Soon young Edward, a potential York claimant to the throne, was moved to the Tower of London. Edward was briefly displayed in public at St Paul's Cathedral in 1487 in response to the presentation of the impostor Lambert Simnel as the \\"Earl of Warwick\\" to the Irish lords. Shortly thereafter, probably in November 1487, Henry VII gave Margaret in marriage to his cousin, Sir Richard Pole, whose mother was half-sister of the king's mother, Margaret Beaufort. When Perkin Warbeck impersonated Edward IV's presumed-dead son Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, in 1499, Margaret's brother Edward was attainted and executed for involvement in the plot. Richard Pole held a variety of offices in Henry VII's government, the highest being Chamberlain for Arthur, Prince of Wales, Henry's elder son. When Arthur married Catherine of Aragon, Margaret became one of her ladies-in-waiting, but her entourage was dissolved when the teenaged Arthur died in 1502. Margaret as a child When her husband died in 1505, Margaret was a widow with five children, a limited amount of land inherited from her husband, no other income and no prospects. Henry VII paid for Richard's funeral. To ease the situation, Margaret devoted her third son Reginald Pole to the Church, where he was to have an eventful career as a papal Legate and later Archbishop of Canterbury. Nonetheless, he was to resent her abandonment of him bitterly in later life. Additionally, Margaret, without adequate means to support herself and her children, was forced to live at Syon Abbey among Bridgettine nuns after her husband's death. She was to remain there until she returned to favour at the ascension of Henry VIII in 1509. Countess of Salisbury When Henry VIII came to the throne in 1509, he married Catherine of Aragon himself. Margaret was again appointed one of her ladies-in-waiting. In 1512, Parliament restored to her some of her brother's lands of the earldom of Salisbury (only), for which she paid 5000 marks (¬£2666.13s.4d). Henry VII had controlled them, first during her brother's minority and then during his imprisonment, and had confiscated them after his trial. The same Act also restored to Margaret the Earldom of Salisbury.ODNB, which argues that the restoration was a tacit admission of her brother's innocence; however, lands and titles had been restored to the heirs of guilty peers during the previous century. The Warwick and Spencer [Despencer] lands remained crown property.TNA, minsters' accounts, SC6/HENVIII. As Countess of Salisbury, Margaret managed her lands well, and by 1538, she was the fifth richest peer in England. She was a patron of the new learning, like many Renaissance nobles; Gentian Hervet translated Erasmus' de immensa misericordia Dei (The Great Mercy of God) into English for her. Her first son, Henry Pole, was created Baron Montagu, another of the Neville titles; he spoke for the family in the House of Lords. Her second son, Arthur Pole, had a generally successful career as a courtier, becoming one of the six Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber. He suffered a setback when his patron Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, was convicted of treason in 1521, but he was soon restored to favour. He died young about 1526, having married the heir of Roger Lewknor; the Countess and her son Henry pressed Arthur's widow to a vow of perpetual chastity to preserve her inheritance for her Pole children. Margaret's daughter Ursula married the Duke of Buckingham's son, Henry Stafford, but after the Duke's fall, the couple was given only fragments of his estates. Margaret's third son, Reginald Pole, studied abroad in Padua; he was dean in Exeter and Wimborne Minster, Dorset as well as canon in York. He had several other livings, although he had not been ordained a priest. He represented Henry VIII in Paris in 1529, persuading the theologians of the Sorbonne to support Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon.ODNB, Reginald Pole Her youngest son Geoffrey Pole married well, to Constance, daughter of Edmund Pakenham, and inherited the estate of Lordington in Sussex. Margaret's own favour at Court varied. She had a dispute over land with Henry VIII in 1518; he awarded the contested lands to the Dukedom of Somerset, which had been held by his Beaufort great-grandfather‚Äîand were now in the possession of the Crown. In 1520, Margaret was appointed governess to Henry's daughter Mary; the next year, when her sons were mixed up with Buckingham, she was removed, but she was restored by 1525. When Mary was declared a bastard in 1533, Margaret refused to give Mary's gold plate and jewels back to Henry. Mary's household was broken up at the end of the year, and Margaret asked to serve Mary at her own cost, but was not permitted. The Imperial Ambassador Eustace Chapuys suggested two years later that Mary be handed over to Margaret, but Henry refused, calling her \\"a fool, of no experience\\". When Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn, was arrested, and eventually executed, in 1536, Margaret was permitted to return to Court, albeit briefly.ODNB; quotation as given there. Fall In 1531, Reginald Pole warned of the dangers of the Boleyn marriage. He returned to Padua in 1532, and received a last English benefice in December of that year. Chapuys suggested to Emperor Charles V that Reginald marry Mary and combine their dynastic claims. Chapuys also communicated with Reginald through his brother Geoffrey. Reginald replied to books Henry sent him with his own pamphlet, pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione, or de unitate, which denied Henry's position on the marriage of a brother's wife and denied the royal supremacy. Reginald also urged the princes of Europe to depose Henry immediately. Henry wrote to Margaret, who in turn wrote to her son a letter reproving him for his \\"folly\\".ODNB, \\"Reginald Pole\\"; \\"Geoffrey Pole\\". Pole and his hagiographers gave several later accounts of Pole's activities after Henry met Anne Boleyn. These are not consistent; and if‚Äîas he claimed at one point‚ÄîPole rejected the Divorce in 1526 and refused the Oath of Supremacy in 1531, he received benefits from Henry for a course of action for which others were sentenced to death. In May 1536, Reginald finally and definitively broke with the king. In 1537, Reginald (still not ordained) was created a Cardinal. Pope Paul III put him in charge of organising assistance for the Pilgrimage of Grace (and related movements), an effort to organise a march on London to install a conservative Catholic government instead of Henry's increasingly Protestant-leaning one. Neither Francis I of France nor the Emperor supported this effort, and the English government tried to have him assassinated. In 1539, Reginald was sent to the Emperor to organise an embargo against England‚Äîthe sort of countermeasure he had himself warned Henry was possible.ODNB, Reginald Pole. As part of the investigations into the so-called Exeter Conspiracy, Geoffrey Pole was arrested in August 1538; he had been corresponding with Reginald, and the investigation of Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter (Henry VIII's first cousin and Geoffrey's second cousin) had turned up his name. Geoffrey had appealed to Thomas Cromwell, who had him arrested and interrogated. Under interrogation, Geoffrey said that his eldest brother, Lord Montagu, and the Marquess had been parties to his correspondence with Reginald. Montagu, Exeter, and Margaret were arrested in November 1538. In January 1539, Geoffrey was pardoned, but Margaret's son Henry, Baron Montagu (and cousin Exeter) were later executed for treason after trial. In May 1539, Henry, Margaret, Exeter and others were attainted, as Margaret's father had been. This conviction meant they lost their titles and their lands‚Äîmostly in the South of England, conveniently located to assist any invasion. As part of the evidence for the bill of attainder, Cromwell produced a tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, symbolising Margaret's support for Catholicism and the rule of her son Reginald and the king's Catholic daughter Mary. The supposed discovery, six months after her house and effects were searched at her arrest, is likely to have been a fabrication. She was sentenced to death, and could be executed at the king's will. Margaret Pole, as she now was styled, was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years. She, her grandson Henry (son of her own son Henry), and Exeter's son were held together and supported by the king. She was attended by servants and received an extensive grant of clothing in March 1541. In 1540, Cromwell himself fell from favour and was attainted and executed. Execution The following poem was found carved on the wall of her cell: On the morning of 27 May 1541, Margaret was told she was to die within the hour. She answered that no crime had been imputed to her. Nevertheless, she was taken from her cell to the place within the precincts of the Tower of London where a low wooden block had been prepared instead of the customary scaffold. As she was of noble birth, she was not executed before the populace. Two written reports survive of her execution, both being eyewitnesses: by Marillac, the French ambassador; and by Chapuys, ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor. Their accounts differ slightly, with Marillac's report, dispatched two days afterwards, recording that the execution took place in a corner of the Tower with so few people present that in the evening news of her execution was doubted. Chapuys wrote two weeks after the execution that 150 witnesses had been present including the Lord Mayor of London. He wrote that, \\"at first, when the sentence of death was made known to her, she found the thing very strange, not knowing of what crime she was accused, nor how she had been sentenced\\" and that, because the main executionerThis was not, as some say, Cratwell, who had himself been executed three years earlier had been sent north to deal with rebels, the execution was performed by \\"a wretched and blundering youth who literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner\\". An apocryphal account, described in Burke's Peerage as an invention to explain the appalling circumstances of her death, states that Margaret refused to lay her head on the block, declaiming, \\"So should traitors do, and I am none\\"; according to the account, she turned her head \\"every which way\\", instructing the executioner that, if he wanted her head, he should take it as he could.The Complete Peerage, v. XII p. II, p. 393 Margaret was buried in the chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula within the Tower of London.Profile of Margaret, Lady Salisbury, Regina (online) Her son, Reginald Pole, said that he would \\"never fear to call himself the son of a martyr\\". She was later regarded by Catholics as such and was beatified on 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII.Camm, Bede, Lives of the English martyrs declared blessed by Pope Leo XIII in 1886 and 1895 (Burns and Oates Limited, 1904), ix. Family When not at Court, Margaret lived chiefly at Warblington Castle in Hampshire and Bisham Manor in Berkshire. She and her husband were parents to five children: * Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu (c. 14929 January 1539), notable as one of the peers in the trial of Anne Boleyn; married Jane Neville, daughter of George Nevill, 5th Baron Bergavenny, and Joan FitzAlan (also known as Joan of Arundel); beheaded by order of Henry VIII. A great-grandson of Henry Pole was Sir John Bourchier, a regicide of King Charles I of England, who was a great-great-grandnephew of Henry VIII. * Arthur Pole (before 1499before 1532), Lord of the Manor of Broadhurst in Sussex; married Jane Lewkenor, daughter of Sir Roger Lewkenor and the former Eleanor Tuchet, herself daughter of the 6th Baron Audley and the former Anne Echingham. * Reginald Pole (c. 150017 November 1558), cardinal, papal legate in various regions, including England, and the last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. * Geoffrey Pole (c. 1501‚Äì1558), Lord of the Manor of Lordington in Sussex, suspected of treason by King Henry VIII and accused of conspiring with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor; lived in exile in Europe; married Constance Pakenham, granddaughter and heir of Sir John Pakenham. John Pakenham was ancestor to Sir Edward Pakenham, brother-in-law to the Duke of Wellington. * Ursula Pole (c. 150412 August 1570), married Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford. Cultural depictions Margaret appears in William Shakespeare's 16th century play Richard III as the young daughter of the murdered Duke of Clarence. The character of Lady Salisbury in the Showtime series The Tudors, played by Kate O'Toole in 2007 and 2009, is loosely based on Margaret Pole. Janet Henfrey portrays Margaret in Episode 4 (\\"The Devil's Spit\\") of Wolf Hall, the 2015 BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's novels Wolf Hall (2009) and Bring Up the Bodies (2012). Margaret is the main character of Philippa Gregory's 2014 novel The King's Curse. She also appears in Gregory's 2013 novel The White Princess as well as The Kingmaker's Daughter, and was portrayed by Rebecca Benson in the television adaptation of The White Princess. Margaret is portrayed by Laura Carmichael in the miniseries The Spanish Princess, a sequel to The White Princess. Margaret is the main character of Samantha Wilcoxson's 2016 novel, Faithful Traitor.

During the war, he was involved in several operations, including the removal from power of Hungarian Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy and the Gran Sasso raid which rescued Benito Mussolini from captivity. Skorzeny led Operation Greif in which German soldiers infiltrated Allied lines by using their opponents' uniforms, equipment, language and customs. He was charged for that at the Dachau Military Tribunal with breaching the 1907 Hague Convention, but was acquitted after a former British SOE agent F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas testified that he and his operatives had worn German uniforms behind enemy lines. Skorzeny escaped from an internment camp in 1948, hiding out on a Bavarian farm for 18 months and spent time in Paris and Salzburg before eventually settling in Francoist Spain. In 1953 he became a military advisor to Egyptian President Mohammed Naguib and recruited a staff of former SS and Wehrmacht officers to train the Egyptian Army, staying on to advise President Gamal Abdel Nasser. He spent time in Argentina, where he acted as an advisor to President Juan Per√≥n and as a bodyguard for Eva Per√≥n. In 1962 or 1963, Skorzeny was allegedly recruited by the Mossad and conducted operations for the agency. Skorzeny died of lung cancer on 5 July 1975 in Madrid at the age of 67. Pre-war years Otto Skorzeny was born in Vienna into a middle-class Austrian family which had a long history of military service. His surname is of Polish origin, and Skorzeny's distant ancestors came from a village called Skorzƒôcin in Greater Poland region.Otto Skorzeny, My Commando Operations: The Memoirs of Hitler's Most Daring Commando, p. 40 In addition to his native German, he spoke excellent French and was proficient in English. In his teens, Skorzeny once complained to his father about the austere lifestyle the family was enduring; his father replied, \\"There is no harm in doing without things. It might even be good for you not to get used to a soft life.\\" He was a noted fencer as member of a German-national Burschenschaft as a university student in Vienna. He engaged in fifteen personal combats. The tenth resulted in a wound that left a dramatic dueling scar‚Äîknown in academic fencing as a Schmiss (German for \\"smite\\" or \\"hit\\")‚Äîon his cheek. In 1931 Skorzeny joined the Austrian Nazi organization and soon became a member of the Nazi SA. A charismatic figure, Skorzeny played a minor role in the Anschluss on 12 March 1938, when he saved the Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas from being shot by Austrian Nazis. Eastern Front After the 1939 invasion of Poland, Skorzeny, then working as a civil engineer, volunteered for service in the German Air Force (the Luftwaffe), but was turned down because he was considered too tall at and too old (31 years in 1939) for aircrew training. He then joined Hitler's bodyguard regiment, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). Skorzeny took part in the invasion of the Soviet Union with the SS Division Das Reich and subsequently fought in several battles on the Eastern Front. In October 1941, he was in charge of a \\"technical section\\" of German forces during the Battle of Moscow. His mission was to seize important buildings of the Communist Party, including the NKVD headquarters at Lubyanka, and the central telegraph office and other high priority facilities, before they could be destroyed. He was also ordered to capture the sluices of the Moscow-Volga Canal because Hitler wanted to turn Moscow into a huge artificial lake by opening them.Ganzenm√ºller, J√∂rg (18 July 2011). Blockade Leningrads: Hunger als Waffe. Zeit Online; retrieved 6 November 2011 (in German). The missions were canceled as German forces failed to capture the capital of Russia. Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal special forces unit, 1943 In December 1942, Skorzeny was hit in the back of the head by shrapnel; he was evacuated to the rear for treatment. He was awarded the Iron Cross. While recuperating from his injuries he was given a staff role in Berlin, where he developed his ideas on unconventional commando warfare. Skorzeny's proposals were to develop units specialized in such warfare, including partisan-like fighting deep behind enemy lines, fighting in enemy uniform, sabotage attacks, etc. In April 1943 Skorzeny's name was put forward by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the new head of the RSHA, and Skorzeny met with Walter Schellenberg, head of Amt VI, Ausland-SD (the SS foreign intelligence service department of the RSHA). Schellenberg charged Skorzeny with command of the schools organized to train operatives in sabotage, espionage, and paramilitary techniques. Skorzeny was appointed commander of the recently created Waffen Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal stationed near Berlin (the unit was later renamed SS Jagdverband 502, and in November 1944 again to SS Combat Unit \\"Center\\", expanding ultimately to five battalions). The unit's first mission was in mid-1943, Operation Fran√ßois. Skorzeny sent a group by parachute into Iran to make contact with the dissident mountain tribes to encourage them to sabotage Allied supplies of material being sent to the Soviet Union via the Trans-Iranian Railway. However, commitment among the rebel tribes was suspect, and Operation Fran√ßois was deemed a failure.Skorzeny, Otto (1950), Skorzeny's Secret Missions, New York: EP Dutton and Company Inc. Operations by Skorzeny * Operation Fran√ßois ‚Äì Co-ordination of guerrilla operations in Iran. * Operation Oak (Unternehmen Eiche, September 1943) ‚Äì rescue of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. * Operation Long Jump ‚Äì A planned operation to assassinate the \\"Big Three\\" (Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt) during the 1943 Tehran Conference. The plot was uncovered before its inception. Skorzeny denied any plan existed. * Operation Knight's Leap (Unternehmen R√∂sselsprung, May 1944) ‚Äì An attempt to capture Josip Broz Tito alive. * Operation Armoured Fist (Unternehmen Panzerfaust a.k.a. Unternehmen Eisenfaust, October 1944) ‚Äì kidnapping of Mikl√≥s Horthy Jr. to force his father, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, to resign as Regent of Hungary in favor of Ferenc Sz√°lasi, the pro-Nazi leader of the Arrow Cross Party. * Operation Griffin (Unternehmen Greif, December 1944) ‚Äì A false flag operation to spread disinformation during the Battle of the Bulge. * Werwolf SS ‚Äì A planned Nazi underground resistance movement in Allied-occupied Europe. =Liberation of Mussolini= Skorzeny (centre, binoculars hanging from neck) with the liberated Mussolini ‚Äì 12 September 1943 On the night between 24 and 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the Allied invasion of Sicily and bombing of Rome, the Italian Grand Council of Fascism voted a motion of no confidence (Ordine del Giorno Grandi) against Mussolini. On the same day, the king replaced him with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and had him arrested. Hitler's common procedure was to give similar orders to competing organisations within the German military. So he ordered Skorzeny to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation. Mussolini was being transported around Italy by his captors (first to Ponza, then to La Maddalena, both small islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea). Intercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by the agents and informants (counterfeit British bank notes with a face value of ¬£100,000 forged under Operation Bernhard were used to help obtain information) of SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Herbert Kappler to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned at Campo Imperatore Hotel, a ski resort at Campo Imperatore in Italy's Gran Sasso massif, high in the Apennine Mountains. On 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the Fallschirmj√§ger to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten DFS 230 gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by Henschel Hs 126 planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the Pratica di Mare Air Base near Rome. The leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-Oberleutnant Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch entered the first glider, Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close by Alban Hills the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skozeny's two units arrived first over the target. Meanwhile, the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major Otto-Harald Mors, who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05 the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; only one crashed, causing injuries. The Fallschirmj√§ger and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors (200 well-equipped Carabinieri guards) without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General of the Polizia dell' Africa Italiana, who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, being followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45 Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini. Fieseler Fi 156 Storch used to rescue Mussolini Subsequently, Mussolini was to be flown out by a meanwhile arrived Fieseler Fi 156 STOL plane. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted to accompany Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful lift-off, they flew to Pratica di Mare. There they continued immediately, flying in a Heinkel He 111 to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the Hotel Imperial. The next day he was flown to Munich and on September 14 he met Hitler at the Wolf's Lair F√ºhrer Headquarters near Rastenburg.Erich Kuby: Verrat auf deutsch. Wie das Dritte Reich Italien ruinierte. Hoffmann und Campe, Hamburg 1982, . The landing at Campo Imperatore was in fact led by First Lieutenant Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch, commanded by Major Otto-Harald Mors and under orders from General Kurt Student, all Fallschirmj√§ger (German air force paratroop) officers; but Skorzeny stewarded the Italian leader right in front of the cameras. After a pro-SS propaganda coup at the behest of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler and propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Skorzeny and his Special Forces (SS-Sonderverband z. b. V. \\"Friedenthal\\") of the Waffen-SS were granted the majority of the credit for the operation. =Operation Long Jump= Skorzeny (2nd from left), 3 October 1943 \\"Operation Long Jump\\" was the alleged codename given to a plot to assassinate the \\"Big Three\\" (Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt) at the 1943 Tehran Conference. Hitler supposedly gave the command of the operation to Ernst Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA, who, in turn, ceded the mission to Skorzeny. Knowledge of the whole scheme was presented to the Western Allies by Stalin's NKVD at the Tehran conference. The Soviets said they had learned about its existence from counter espionage activities against German intelligence. Their agents had found out the Nazis knew the time and place of this meeting because they had cracked a US naval code. According to the NKVD the assassination plot was foiled after they identified the German spies in Iran forcing Skorzeny to call off the mission due to inadequate intelligence. Following Tehran, the story was treated with incredulity by the British and Americans who dismissed it as Soviet propaganda. Skorzeny supported this view by stating in his post-war memoirs that no such operation ever existed. He said the story about the plans being leaked to Soviet spy Nikolai Kuznetsov by an SS Sturmbannf√ºhrer named Hans Ulrich von Ortel was a complete Soviet invention; Hans Ulrich von Ortel never existed. Skorzeny claimed his name was used only to add credibility to the story because the NKVD knew his renowned record as an SS commando would make the existence of such an operation more plausible. =Raid on Drvar= In early 1944, Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal was re-designated SS-J√§ger-Bataillon 502 with Skorzeny staying on as commander. They were assigned to Operation R√∂sselsprung, known subsequently as the Raid on Drvar. R√∂sselsprung was a commando operation meant to capture the Yugoslav commander-in-chief, Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had also recently been recognized by the Allies as the Yugoslav prime minister. Marshal Tito led the Yugoslav Partisan resistance army from his headquarters near the Bosnian town of Drvar, in the center of a large area held by the Partisans.Eyre, Wayne D. Operation R√∂sselsprung and the Elimination of Tito, 25 May 1944: A Failure in Planning and Intelligence Support. http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a403840.pdf, p. 6 Hitler knew Tito was receiving Allied support and was aware that either British or American troops might land in Dalmatia along the Adriatic coastline with support from the Partisans. Killing or capturing Tito would not only hinder this, it would give a badly needed boost to the morale of Axis forces engaged in occupied Yugoslavia. Skorzeny was involved in planning R√∂sselsprung and was intended to command it. However, he argued against implementation after he visited Zagreb and discovered that the operation had been compromised through the carelessness of German agents in the Nazi-affiliated Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslav territory. R√∂sselsprung was put into action nonetheless, but it was a complete disaster. The first wave of paratroopers, following heavy bombardment by the Luftwaffe, jumped between Tito's hideout in a cave and the town of Drvar; they landed on open ground and many were promptly shot by members of the Tito Escort Battalion, a unit numbering fewer than a hundred soldiers. The second wave of paratroopers missed their target and landed several miles out of town. Tito was gone long before paratroopers reached the cave; a trail at the back of the cave led to the railway tracks where Tito boarded a train that took him safely to Jajce. In the meantime, the Partisan 1st Brigade, from the 6th Lika Partisan Division, arrived after a twelve-mile (nineteen-kilometer) forced march and attacked the Waffen-SS paratroopers, inflicting heavy casualties. =Hungary and Operation Panzerfaust= Otto Skorzeny (left), Adrian von F√∂lkersam (middle), SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer Walter Girg (right) in Budapest, October 16, 1944. In October 1944, Hitler sent Skorzeny to Hungary after receiving word that the Regent of Hungary, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, was secretly negotiating with the Red Army. The surrender of Hungary would have cut off the million German troops still fighting in the Balkan peninsula. Skorzeny, in a daring \\"snatch\\" codenamed Operation Panzerfaust (known as Operation Eisenfaust in Germany), kidnapped Horthy's son Mikl√≥s Horthy Jr. and forced his father to resign as head of state. A pro-Nazi government under dictator Ferenc Sz√°lasi was then installed in Hungary. In April 1945, after German and Hungarian forces had already been driven out of Hungary, Sz√°lasi and his Arrow Cross Party-based forces continued the fight in Austria and Slovakia. The success of the operation earned Skorzeny promotion to Obersturmbannf√ºhrer.Prof. Nikolaus von Preradovich: √ñsterreichs h√∂here SS-F√ºhrer. Vowinckel, Berg am See 1987; , p. 317. =Operation Greif and the German defeat= Skorzeny in Pomerania visiting the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, February 1945. As part of the German Ardennes offensive in late 1944 (Battle of the Bulge), Skorzeny's English-speaking troops were charged with infiltrating American lines disguised in American uniforms in order to produce confusion to support the German attack. For the campaign, Skorzeny was the commander of a composite unit, the 150th SS Panzer Brigade. As planned by Skorzeny, Operation Greif involved about two dozen German soldiers, most of them in captured American Jeeps and disguised in American uniforms, who would penetrate American lines in the early hours of the Battle of the Bulge to cause disorder and confusion. Skorzeny was well aware that under the Hague Convention of 1907, any of his men captured while wearing U.S. uniforms would be executed as spies and this possibility caused much discussion with Generaloberst Jodl and Field Marshal von Rundstedt. A handful of his men were captured and spread a rumour that Skorzeny personally was leading a raid on Paris to kill or capture General Eisenhower, who was not amused by having to spend Christmas 1944 isolated for security reasons. Eisenhower retaliated by ordering an all-out manhunt for Skorzeny, with \\"Wanted\\" posters distributed throughout Allied-controlled territories featuring a detailed description and a photograph.Lee, p. 32 In all, twenty-three of Skorzeny's men were captured behind American lines and eighteen were executed as spies for contravening the rules of war by wearing enemy uniforms. Skorzeny spent January and February 1945 commanding regular troops as an acting major general, taking part in the defence of the German provinces of East Prussia and Pomerania, and at the Defence of Schwedt Bridgehead. On 17 March, he received orders to sabotage the last remaining intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen following its capture by the Allies, but the bridge collapsed that same day, and the naval demolitions squad prepared instead unsuccessfully attacked a nearby Allied pontoon bridge between Kripp and Linz. Hitler awarded him one of Germany's highest military honours, the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross. Postwar =Dachau trials= Waiting in a cell as a witness at the Nuremberg trials ‚Äì 24 November 1945 Skorzeny was interned for two years before being tried as a war criminal at the Dachau trials in 1947 for allegedly violating the laws of war during the Battle of the Bulge. He and nine officers of the Panzerbrigade 150 were tried before a US Military Tribunal in Dachau on 18 August 1947. They faced charges of improper use of US military insignia, theft of US uniforms, and theft of Red Cross parcels from U.S. POWs. The trial lasted over three weeks. The charge of stealing Red Cross parcels was dropped for lack of evidence. Skorzeny admitted to ordering his men to wear US uniforms, but his defence argued that as long as enemy uniforms were discarded before combat started, such a tactic was a legitimate ruse de guerre. On the final day of the trial, 9 September, F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, a former British SOE agent, testified that he and his operatives wore German uniforms behind enemy lines; the Tribunal acquitted the ten defendants. The Tribunal drew a distinction between using enemy uniforms during combat and for other purposes including deception and were unable to prove that Skorzeny had given any orders to actually fight in U.S. uniforms. =Escape from prison = Skorzeny was detained in an internment camp at Darmstadt awaiting the decision of a denazification court. On 27 July 1948 he escaped from the camp with the help of three former SS officers dressed in US Military Police uniforms who entered the camp and claimed that they had been ordered to take Skorzeny to Nuremberg for a legal hearing. Skorzeny afterwards maintained that the US authorities had aided his escape, and had supplied the uniforms.Lee, pp. 42-43 Skorzeny hid out at a farm in Bavaria which had been rented by Countess Ilse L√ºthje, the niece of Hjalmar Schacht (Hitler's former finance minister), for around 18 months, during which time he was in contact with Reinhard Gehlen, and together with Hartmann Lauterbacher (former deputy head of the Hitler Youth) recruited for the Gehlen Organization.Lee, pp. 43-44 Skorzeny was photographed at a caf√© on the Champs Elys√©es in Paris on 13 February 1950. The photo appeared in the French press the next day, causing him to move to Salzburg, where he met up with German veterans and also filed for divorce so that he could marry Ilse L√ºthje.Lee, p. 45 Shortly afterwards, with the help of a Nansen passport issued by the Spanish government, he moved to Madrid, where he set up a small engineering business. On April 1950 the publication of Skorzeny's memoirs by the French newspaper Le Figaro caused 1500 communists to riot outside the journal's headquarters. = Military advisor = Otto Skorzeny (left) and Juan Per√≥n (center). In 1952 Egypt was taken over by General Mohammed Naguib. Skorzeny was sent to Egypt the following year by former General Reinhard Gehlen (who was now working indirectly for the CIA) to act as Naguib's military advisor. Skorzeny recruited a staff made up of former SS and Wehrmacht officers to train the Egyptian army. Among these officers were former Wehrmacht generals Wilhelm Fahrmbacher and Oskar Munzel; the head of the Gestapo Department for Jewish Affairs in Poland Leopold Gleim; and Joachim Daemling, former chief of the Gestapo in D√ºsseldorf. In addition to training the army, Skorzeny also trained Arab volunteers in commando tactics for possible use against British troops stationed in the Suez Canal zone. Several Palestinian refugees also received commando training, and Skorzeny planned their raids into Israel via the Gaza Strip in 1953-1954. One of these Palestinians was Yasser Arafat.Infield, Glenn B. Skorzeny: Hitler's Commando, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1981. He stayed on to serve as an adviser to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.John S. Craig. \\"Peculiar liaisons: in war, espionage, and terrorism in the twentieth century\\", Algora Publishing, 2005; /. pg. 163 According to some authors, he traveled between Spain and Argentina, where he acted as an advisor to President Juan Per√≥n and as a bodyguard for Eva Per√≥n, while fostering an ambition for the \\"Fourth Reich\\" to be centered in Latin America.InfieldWechsberg, pp. 81, 116 = Alleged recruitment by Mossad = The Israeli security and intelligence magazine Matara published an article in 1989 claiming that Skorzeny had been recruited by Mossad in 1963 to obtain information on German scientists who were working on an Egyptian project to develop rockets to be used against Israel. Reporting on the Matara story, the major Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronot said that it had confirmed the story from their own senior Mossad source. Former Mossad head Isser Harel confirmed the story that former Nazis were recruited to provide intelligence on Arab countries. Ian Black and Benny Morris wrote in 1991 that Skorzeny may not have known for whom he was working, but in 2010, Tom Segev published in his biography of Simon Wiesenthal that Skorzeny had offered to help only if Wiesenthal removed him from his list of wanted war criminals. Wiesenthal refused, but Skorzeny finally agreed to help anyway. Segev gave as his main source the senior Mossad agent Rafi Meidan to whom Segev attributes the primary role in the recruitment of Skorzeny. Further details of the story were published by Yossi Melman and Dan Raviv in 2016. According to their information, a Mossad team had started to develop a plan to kill Skorzeny, but chief Isser Harel decided to attempt to recruit him instead, as a man on the inside would greatly enhance their ability to target Nazis who were providing military assistance to Egypt. He allegedly was recruited and conducted operations for Mossad from 1962, working with Avraham Ahituv and Rafi Eitan. Other unnamed sources asserted Skorzeny was recruited after Mossad visited his home in Spain, where he expected that he would be assassinated. After undergoing instruction and training in the Mossad's facilities in Israel, the rumoured work for Mossad included assassinating German rocket scientist Heinz Krug who was working for the Egyptian government and mailing a letter bomb which killed five Egyptians at the Egyptian military rocket site Factory 333. He also allegedly supplied the names and addresses of German scientists working for Egypt and the names of European front companies supplying military hardware to Egypt. No confirmed source can explain Skorzeny's motives for working with Israel, but he may have craved adventure and intrigue and feared assassination by Mossad.Otto Skorzeny:Hitler‚Äôs scarfaced henchman-Irish farmer and Mossad hitman: Posted on 17 October 2016 under History, Ireland, Mossad, Nazi, Post WWII, World War 2- Retrieved 2017-04-15 An article featured in Der Spiegel on 22 January 2018 raised doubts as to the involvement of Skorzeny in Krug's death, stating that Mossad boss Isser Harel ordered the murder. =Other activities= Like thousands of other former Nazis, Skorzeny was declared entnazifiziert (denazified) in absentia in 1952 by a West German government arbitration board, which meant that he could now travel from Spain into other Western countries, on a special Nansen passport for stateless persons with which he visited Ireland in 1957 and 1958. In late 1958, he qualified for an Austrian passport and in 1959, he purchased Martinstown House, a farm in County Kildare. Although Skorzeny could not be refused entry without due cause, he was refused a residency visa by the Irish government and had to limit his stays to six weeks at a time, and he was monitored by G2. He rarely visited after 1963 and sold Martinstown House in 1971. At 6 ft 4 in (193 cm) and weighing , along with his scar, he was easily recognizable and caused speculation among the English and Irish press as to why he was in Ireland. One Kildare resident recalled Skorzeny as someone who \\"wasn't particularly friendly and [who] didn't really mix with local people\\". Skorzeny also owned property on Majorca. In the 1960s, Skorzeny set up the Paladin Group, which he envisioned as \\"an international directorship of strategic assault personnel [that would] straddle the watershed between paramilitary operations carried out by troops in uniform and the political warfare which is conducted by civilian agents\\". Based near Alicante, Spain, the Paladin Group specialized in arming and training guerrillas. Some of its operatives were recruited by the Spanish Interior Ministry to wage a clandestine war against the terrorist group ETA.Lee, p. 185 Skorzeny was a founder and an advisor to the leadership of the Spanish neo-Nazi group CEDADE, established in 1966.Lee, p. 186 It is rumored that under the cover names Robert Steinbacher and Otto Steinbauer and supported by either Nazi funds or (according to some sources) by Austrian intelligence, Skorzeny set up a secret organization named Die Spinne (English: \\"The Spider\\"), which helped as many as 600 former SS men escape from Germany to Spain, Argentina, and from there to other countries. Over the years, Skorzeny, Gehlen, and their network of collaborators supposedly gained enormous influence in Europe and Latin America. Death In 1970, a cancerous tumour was discovered on Skorzeny's spine. Two tumours were later removed while he was staying at a hospital in Hamburg, but the surgery left him paralyzed from the waist down. Vowing to walk again, Skorzeny spent long hours with a physical therapist; and, within six months, he was back on his feet. Skorzeny died of lung cancer on 5 July 1975 in Madrid. He was 67 years old.Deutsche Biographische Enzyklop√§die, volume 9 Schmidt - Theyer, K.G. Sauer, Munich 1998; At no point in his life did Skorzeny ever denounce Nazism. He was given a Roman Catholic funeral Mass in Madrid on 7 August 1975. His body was cremated afterwards, and his ashes were later taken to Vienna to be interred in the Skorzeny family plot at D√∂blinger Friedhof. His funeral \\"was attended by dozens of German military veterans and wives, who did not hesitate to give the one-armed Nazi salute\\", according to former Mossad agents who also attended the funeral.How a famous former Nazi officer became a hitman for Israel- Retrieved 2017-03-15 Awards *Iron Cross (1939) 2nd Class (26 August 1941) & 1st Class (12 September 1943)Thomas 1998, p. 329. * Knights Cross of the Iron Cross, 13 September 1943; Oakleaves, 9 April 1945 (826th) In fiction Like many other prominent World War II figures, Skorzeny has been portrayed in several works of fiction, such as the Worldwar tetralogy by Harry Turtledove, 1945 by Newt Gingrich, and others. In The Eagle Has Landed by Jack Higgins, the rescue of Mussolini inspires a plan to kidnap Winston Churchill. The Atomic Robo comic book includes Skorzeny.

With his brother, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector of England, he vied for control of their nephew, the young King Edward VI (). In 1547 Seymour became the fourth husband of Catherine Parr, who had been the sixth and last wife and queen of Henry VIII. During his marriage to Catherine Parr, Seymour involved the future Queen Elizabeth I (then 14 years old), who resided in his household, in flirtatious and possibly sexual behaviour. Family Thomas Seymour was the son of Sir John Seymour and Margaret Wentworth. He was the younger brother of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (1500‚Äì1552). He grew up at Wulfhall, the Seymour family home, in Wiltshire, a county in southwest England. The Seymours were a family of country gentry, who, like most holders of manorial rights, traced their ancestry to a Norman origin. Because Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, did not have a son (Henry hoped for a male heir), his interests turned elsewhere, to Thomas Seymour's sister Jane, one of Anne's ladies in waiting. Henry married Jane eleven days after Anne's execution in May 1536, and the Seymour brothers saw their fortunes rise, as they became part of the royal family. In October of the following year, Jane gave birth to a son, Edward Tudor, who would become King Edward VI. Her two brothers, Edward and Thomas, were therefore uncles to the baby Edward, heir to the throne. Less than two weeks later, Queen Jane died from complications related to childbirth. Thomas Seymour's other royal connection was with Catherine Parr, Henry VIII's sixth wife, whom Seymour would later marry, after Henry's death. In 1543 Catherine Parr established herself as part of Princess Mary's household, where she caught the attention of the King. Although she had already begun a romantic relationship with Thomas Seymour, she saw it as her duty to accept Henry's proposal. Foreign affairs In 1538, Thomas Seymour was sent to the embassy at the French court. He was one of those appointed to meet Anne of Cleves, King Henry's fourth wife, at Calais on 13 December 1539. cites Chron. of Calais, pp. 168, 173. A few weeks later he was sent to King Ferdinand I of Hungary, brother of Emperor Charles V, to enlist support for Henry against France and Scotland. He arrived at Vienna in July, and remained there two years. In May 1543, he was appointed ambassador to the Habsburg court in Brussels. cites State Papers, Henry VIII, vol. ix. passim. He was given this posting to remove him from King Henry's court, for the King's marriage to Catherine Parr. War breaking out between England and France, Seymour was made marshal of the English army in the Netherlands on 26 June, being second in command to Sir John Wallop. On 24 July 1543, with a strong detachment, he captured and destroyed the castles of Rinquecen and Arbrittayne near the French city of Boulogne. cites State Papers, Henry VIII, vol. ix. 452. For a short time, he held the chief command during Wallop's illness. cites State Papers, Henry VIII, vol. ix. 460‚Äì2 et seq. Due to his position of privilege as a royal uncle and as a reward for his services, Thomas was made Master-General of the Ordnance in 1544 and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1545, both very senior military positions. Regency Council and marriage to Catherine Parr Melton Constable or Hastings portrait of Queen Catherine. He returned to court just before King Henry VIII died in January 1547, leaving Catherine one of the wealthiest women in England. According to the King's will, a regency council was constituted to rule on behalf of the 9-year-old orphaned King Edward. Thomas Seymour became 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley. Edward became Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, and is often, therefore, referred to as \\"Somerset\\". In addition, Thomas Seymour saw his brother rise, in the contentious and dangerous politics of the English Reformation, to the position of chief councillor with an approved title of \\"Protector\\" regent, referred to unofficially as Lord Protector of England, in effect, ruler of the realm as Regent for his nephew, the king. Thomas Seymour, unsurprisingly, began to resent his brother and the relationship between them began to dissolve. Although Thomas Seymour was named Lord High Admiral as a concession, he was consumed by jealousy of his brother's power and influence and worked to unseat and replace his brother as Lord Protector. Thomas Seymour sought to over-turn his brother's position on the regency council by his personal influence over the young king, and also possibly, by making a royal marriage. Although his name had been linked to Mary Howard, Duchess of Richmond, he was still unmarried at the time of the King's death. He had previously shown some interest in marrying either of Henry's daughters, Elizabeth or Mary; however, within weeks of Henry's death, Thomas Seymour had rekindled the affair with Catherine Parr, and they were secretly married in April or May 1547, too soon after the king's death to suit many. Anne Stanhope, Somerset's proud wife, disliked Catherine and Thomas and began to turn many people in court against them. To demonstrate her hatred, Anne kept the Queen's jewels, which by right were Catherine's. In turn, Catherine was annoyed at the appointment of Edward Seymour (Duke of Somerset) as Protector regent, since as King Edward's stepmother, she had expected to be appointed regent.. Relationship with Elizabeth The Lady Elizabeth in about 1546, by an unknown artist Upon their marriage, Seymour moved into his wife's house, at Chelsea Manor in London, where she lived with her step-daughter, the 14-year-old Elizabeth. Seymour was the uncle of Elizabeth's half-brother, and the newly wed husband of her step- mother. Now, living under the same roof as Elizabeth, Thomas Seymour began to molest Elizabeth, tickling her, and slapping her on her behind as she lay in her bed, or coming into her room in his nightclothes. Her governess, Kat Ashley, thought this scandalous, and reported it to Catherine. Indignant, Seymour retorted, 'By God's precious soul, I mean no evil, and I will not leave it!' At first, Catherine dismissed the behaviour as just innocent fun, and even joined in the \\"romps\\" on a few occasions. Elizabeth's feelings regarding this behaviour are unknown, but it was said that she bore Thomas some degree of affection. And though her governess, Kat Ashley, \\"bade him go away in shame,\\" she found him more amusing than dangerous. When Catherine was pregnant in the spring of 1548, she had become concerned enough about her husband's flirtatious relationship with Elizabeth that she sent Elizabeth away to live with Anthony Denny and his wife, Joan Champernowne (Kat Ashley's sister), in Hertfordshire. In June 1548, Catherine and Thomas Seymour moved their household from London to Sudeley Castle, the property granted to Seymour when he became Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In September 1548, Catherine gave birth to a daughter, Mary Seymour. In the following days, she became uncharacteristically hostile and delusional. Thomas lay in bed with her to quiet her, but she did not get better, and died of complications due to childbirth, just before Elizabeth's 15th birthday. Upon her death, Catherine bequeathed all of her possessions to Thomas, making him one of the richest men in England. He said he was \\"amazed\\" at her death; yet it opened up new opportunities to him, as his eye returned to Elizabeth. From fear or shrewdness, she avoided him, returning, with her governess, Kat Ashley, to her childhood home, Hatfield House. Relationship with Edward VI The 9-year-old Edward VI Despite his great wealth and high position, Thomas Seymour could not come to terms with his brother's appointment as protector; and in his struggle with Somerset, he tried to ingratiate himself with the king, who was just a little boy. He sought the 9-year-old Edward to write a letter on his behalf in support of his marriage to the dowager queen, Catherine Parr. The letter was obviously dictated by Thomas for Edward's signature and only enraged Somerset. He began to visit Edward frequently, secretly giving him an extravagant allowance of coins, so that Edward might be satisfied in feeling more grown-up and more king-like, giving gifts to his servants, teachers, and friends. Even though he lived in sumptuous splendor, and wanting for nothing, no provisions had been made for Edward's pocket money and he became accustomed to these regular payments and began to ask Seymour freely for his allowance. Thomas continued his manipulation of the king. In trying to get a bill through Parliament making him Edward's personal governor, Seymour requested Edward's royal signature on the bill. But Edward was uncertain, and reluctant to go behind the back of the protector, Somerset, and of the regency council, and he would not sign it. Seymour persistently pressured Edward, until Edward felt threatened. But Seymour did not give up. He tried to persuade Edward that he did not need a protector, getting Edward to admit that it might be better for Somerset to die. It is not known what the king meant by this, but it was probably uttered innocently. Seymour intended that the king's royal signature and personal support would destabilize Somerset's position as protector, and as a member of the regency council. In his frustration and inability to gain any significant influence over the king, Thomas Seymour began to think in terms of open rebellion. Although he was a boy, King Edward did not seem completely na√Øve regarding any of this. Downfall When Somerset, the Protector, invaded Scotland in the summer of 1547 and was absent from court, his brother, Thomas Seymour, fomented opposition to his authority, voicing open disapproval of his brother's administrative skills. Because his activities seemed suspicious, several members of the nobility advised him to be content with his position, but he would not listen. As Lord High Admiral, he was able to control the English navy, and he openly asked for support in case of a rebellion. He entered into relations with pirates on the western coasts, whom it was his duty as Lord High Admiral to suppress, with a view to securing their support. Thomas seems also to have hoped to finance a rebellion through crooked dealings with the vice-treasurer of the Bristol Mint, Sir William Sharington. By 1548, the regency council was becoming aware of Thomas's bid for power. Somerset tried to save his brother from ruin, calling a council meeting so that Thomas might explain himself. However, Thomas did not appear. On the night of 16 January 1549, for reasons that are not clear (perhaps to take the young king away in his own custody), Seymour was caught trying to break into the King's apartments at Hampton Court Palace. He entered the privy garden and awoke one of the King's pet spaniels. In response to the dog's barking, he shot and killed it. The next day, he was arrested and sent to the Tower of London. The incident, being caught outside the king's bedroom, at night, with a loaded pistol, was interpreted in the most menacing light, even casting suspicion on Elizabeth's involvement with Thomas. On 18 January, the council sent agents to question everyone associated with Thomas, including Elizabeth. On 22 February, the council officially accused him of thirty-three charges of treason. He was convicted of treason, and condemned to death and executed on 20 March 1549. Aftermath When he was arrested for treason, Seymour's associates were also cast under suspicion, including 15-year-old Elizabeth. She did not realize her own danger until her servants, including her governess Kat Ashley, were also arrested. Upon realizing that Thomas would probably be executed, she was noticeably disconsolate, trying to free herself and her servants from suspicion. The regency council was sure of her complicity with Thomas, and sought to bully an easy confession from her. She was interrogated for weeks. But the council found itself in a sharply defined game of wits with Elizabeth, who proved to be a master of logic, defiance, and shrewdness. The embarrassing details of the flirtatious incidents with Seymour came to light. But there was no evidence that Elizabeth had conspired with him. After his execution, all of Thomas Seymour's property was seized by the Crown. His attainder was reversed by Parliament in 1550, although the property was not returned to Mary Seymour, his only child; Mary is believed to have died at about the age of two years soon afterward. To his contemporaries, he appeared as forceful and reckless, and also, very attractive to women. Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, a boyhood friend of King Edward, described Thomas Seymour as \\"hardy, wise and liberal ... fierce in courage, courtly in fashion, in personage stately, in voice magnificent, but somewhat empty of matter.\\" In popular culture In the 1953 movie Young Bess, Stewart Granger was cast as Seymour. The plot, largely a romance between him and Princess Elizabeth (played by 24-year-old Jean Simmons), had very little historical accuracy. In the Showtime television show The Tudors, Andrew McNair portrays Seymour. He appears in seasons three and four. He is a character in the CJ Sansom novel Revelation, featuring Sansom's fictional lawyer/detective Matthew Shardlake. He is portrayed as a hot-headed military man, with designs on Catherine Parr, in the months before the latter's marriage to Henry VIII. He reappears as a secondary character in the next two novels in the series, Heartstone and Lamentation. Norah Lofts, in her biography of Walter Raleigh Here Was a Man, suggests that Elizabeth was attracted to Raleigh because he reminded her of Seymour.

The nickname \\"Hotspur\\" was given to him by the Scots as a tribute to his speed in advance and readiness to attack. The heir to a leading noble family in northern England, Hotspur was one of the earliest and prime movers behind the deposition of King Richard II in favour of Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. He later fell out with the new regime and rebelled, being slain at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 at the height of his career.  Career  Arms of Hotspur Henry Percy was born 20 May 1364 at either Alnwick Castle or Warkworth Castle in Northumberland, the eldest son of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and Margaret Neville, daughter of Ralph de Neville, 2nd Lord Neville of Raby, and Alice de Audley.; . He was knighted by King Edward III in April 1377, together with the future Kings Richard II and Henry IV.; ; . In 1380, he was in Ireland with the Earl of March,. and in 1383, he travelled in Prussia.; . He was appointed warden of the east march either on 30 July 1384 or in May 1385, and in 1385 accompanied Richard II on an expedition into Scotland. \\"As a tribute to his speed in advance and readiness to attack\\" on the Scottish borders, the Scots bestowed on him the name 'Haatspore'. In April 1386, he was sent to France to reinforce the garrison at Calais and led raids into Picardy. Between August and October 1387, he was in command of a naval force in an attempt to relieve the siege of Brest. In appreciation of these military endeavours he was made a Knight of the Garter in 1388. Reappointed as warden of the east march, he commanded the English forces against James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas, at the Battle of Otterburn on 10 August 1388, where he was captured, but soon ransomed for a fee of 7000 marks. During the next few years Percy's reputation continued to grow. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Cyprus in June 1393 and appointed Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine (1394‚Äì98) on behalf of John of Gaunt, Duke of Aquitaine. He returned to England in January 1395, taking part in Richard II's expedition to Ireland, and was back in Aquitaine the following autumn. In the summer of 1396, he was again in Calais. Percy's military and diplomatic service brought him substantial marks of royal favour in the form of grants and appointments, but despite this, the Percy family decided to support Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV, in his rebellion against Richard II. On Henry's return from exile in June 1399, Percy and his father joined his forces at Doncaster and marched south with them. After King Richard's deposition, Percy and his father were 'lavishly rewarded' with lands and offices. Under the new king, Percy had extensive civil and military responsibility in both the east march towards Scotland and in north Wales, where he was appointed High Sheriff of Flintshire in 1399. In north Wales, he was under increasing pressure as a result of the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr. In March 1402, Henry IV appointed Percy royal lieutenant in north Wales, and on 14 September 1402, Percy, his father, and the Earl of Dunbar and March were victorious against a Scottish force at the Battle of Homildon Hill. Among others, they made a prisoner of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas.  Rebellion, death and exhumation  In spite of the favour that Henry IV showed the Percys in many respects, they became increasingly discontented with him. Among their grievances were: * The king's failure to pay the wages due to them for defending the Scottish border * The king's favour towards Dunbar * The king's demand that the Percys hand over their Scottish prisoners * The king's failure to put an end to Owain Glynd≈µr's rebellion through a negotiated settlement * The king's increasing promotion of his son's (Prince Henry) military authority in Wales * The king's failure to ransom Henry Percy's brother-in-law, Sir Edmund Mortimer, whom the Welsh had captured in June 1402; ; ; ; ; . Spurred on by these grievances, the Percys rebelled in the summer of 1403 and took up arms against the king. According to J. M. W. Bean, it is clear that the Percys were in collusion with Glynd≈µr. On his return to England shortly after the victory at Homildon Hill, Henry Percy issued proclamations in Cheshire accusing the king of 'tyrannical government'. Joined by his uncle, Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, Percy marched to Shrewsbury, where he intended to do battle against a force there under the command of the Prince of Wales. The army of his father, however, was slow to move south and it was without the assistance of his father that Henry Percy and Worcester arrived at Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403, where they encountered the king with a large army. The ensuing Battle of Shrewsbury was fierce, with heavy casualties on both sides but, when Henry Percy himself was struck down and killed, his own forces fled. The circumstances of Percy's death differ in accounts. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham stated, in his Historia Anglicana that \\"while he led his men in the fight rashly penetrating the enemy host, [Hotspur] was unexpectedly cut down, by whose hand is not known\\". Another account states that Percy was struck in the face by an arrow when he opened his vizor for a better view.Campaign Chronicles series. The legend that he was killed by the Prince of Wales seems to have been given currency by William Shakespeare, writing at the end of the following century. Shortly after Henry died in battle, his uncle was executed. An attainder was issued and the family's property, including Wressle Castle in Yorkshire, was confiscated by the Crown. The Earl of Worcester was executed two days later.. King Henry, upon being brought Percy's body after the battle, is said to have wept. The body was taken by Thomas Neville, 5th Baron Furnivall to Whitchurch, Shropshire for burial. However, when rumours circulated that Percy was still alive, the king \\"had the corpse exhumed and displayed it, propped upright between two millstones, in the market place at Shrewsbury\\". That done, the king dispatched Percy's head to York, where it was impaled on the Micklegate Bar (one of the city's gates). His four-quarters were sent to London, Newcastle upon Tyne, Bristol, and Chester before they were finally delivered to his widow. She had the body buried in York Minster in November of that year.. In January 1404, Percy was posthumously declared a traitor, and his lands were forfeited to the Crown.  Marriage and issue  Henry Percy married Elizabeth Mortimer, the eldest daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, and his wife, Philippa, the only child of Lionel, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Elizabeth de Burgh, Countess of Ulster.. By her he had two children: Sometime after 3 June 1406, Elizabeth Mortimer married, as her second husband, Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys, by whom she had a son, Sir Roger Camoys.; .

The family Scarabaeidae, as currently defined, consists of over 30,000 species of beetles worldwide; they are often called scarabs or scarab beetles. The classification of this family has undergone significant change in recent years. Several subfamilies have been elevated to family rank (e.g., Pleocomidae, Glaresidae, Glaphyridae, Ochodaeidae, and Geotrupidae), and some reduced to lower ranks. The subfamilies listed in this article are in accordance with those in Bouchard (2011).  Description  Sacred scarab in a cartouche of Thutmosis III from Karnak temple of Amun-Ra, Egypt Scarabs are stout-bodied beetles, many with bright metallic colours, measuring between 1.5 and 160 mm. They have distinctive, clubbed antennae composed of plates called lamellae that can be compressed into a ball or fanned out like leaves to sense odours. The front legs of many species are broad and adapted for digging. In some groups males (and sometimes females) have prominent horns on the head and/or pronotum to fight over mates or resources. A scarab beetle grub from Australia. The C-shaped larvae, called grubs, are pale yellow or white. Most adult beetles are nocturnal, although the flower chafers (Cetoniinae) and many leaf chafers (Rutelinae) are active during the day. The grubs mostly live underground or under debris, so are not exposed to sunlight. Many scarabs are scavengers that recycle dung, carrion, or decaying plant material. Others, such as the Japanese beetle, are plant-eaters. Some of the well-known beetles from the Scarabaeidae are Japanese beetles, dung beetles, June beetles, rose chafers (Australian, European, and North American), rhinoceros beetles, Hercules beetles and Goliath beetles. Several members of this family have structurally coloured shells which act as left-handed circular polarisers; this was the first-discovered example of circular polarization in nature.  Ancient Egypt  In Ancient Egypt, the dung beetle now known as Scarabaeus sacer (formerly Ateuchus sacer) was revered as sacred. Egyptian amulets representing the sacred scarab beetles were traded throughout the Mediterranean world.bugguide.net Family Scarabaeidae - Scarab Beetles  See also  * List of genera of Scarabaeidae * Scarab artifact * Grapevine beetle * Dung beetle - Scarabaeidae dung beetles play an important role in temperate and tropical environments  References   Further reading  * RU Ehlers.

Using, for the most part, his own compositions, it exemplifies the types of verse forms used in Old Norse poetry. Snorri took a prescriptive as well as descriptive approach; he has systematized the material, and often notes that \\"the older poets did not always\\" follow his rules. Most of the forms depend on number of syllables per line, as well as assonance, consonance, and alliteration. Although end rhyme is represented, it does not function in the ways most modern English speakers expect (forms include AAAAAAAA, and AAAABBBB), and plays a very minor role. Understanding this work will be much easier if the First Grammatical Treatise is also available to hand. Many scholars have suggested that the form of H√°ttatal suggests a classical influence deriving from the traditions of Christian learning to which Snorri was doubtlessly exposed. Others have argued that this is a result of using a logical approach, within the framework of a dialog, and that some aspects of the work prove that it was not directly influenced by classical writings.

Vanaheimr is attested in the Poetic Edda; compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda and (in euhemerized form) Heimskringla; both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Vanaheimr is described as the location where the god Nj√∂r√∞r was raised. Attestations Vanaheimr is mentioned a single time in the Poetic Edda; in a stanza of the poem Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l. In Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l, Gagnr√°√∞r (the god Odin in disguise) engages in a game of wits with the j√∂tunn Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir. Gagnr√°√∞r asks Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir whence the Van god Nj√∂r√∞r came, for, though he rules over many hofs and h√∂rgrs, Nj√∂r√∞r was not raised among the √Üsir. Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir responds that Nj√∂r√∞r was created in Vanaheimr by \\"wise powers\\" and references that Nj√∂r√∞r was exchanged as a hostage during the √Üsir-Vanir War. In addition, Vaf√ær√∫√∞nir comments that, when the world ends (Ragnar√∂k), Nj√∂r√∞r will return to the \\"wise Vanir\\" (Bellows here anglicizes Vanir to Wanes): > { :Benjamin Thorpe translation: :In Vanaheim wise powers him created, > :and to the gods a hostage gave. :At the world's dissolution, :he will > return to the wise Vanir.Thorpe (1866:16).  :Henry Adams Bellows > translation: :In the home of the Wanes did the wise ones create him, :And > gave him as a pledge to the gods; :At the fall of the world shall he far > once more :Home to the Wanes so wise.Bellows (1923:79). } In chapter 23 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High says that Nj√∂r√∞r was raised in Vanaheimr, but was later sent as a hostage to the √Üsir.Byock (2005:33). The Heimskringla book Ynglinga saga records an euhemerized account of the origins of Norse mythology. In chapter 1, \\"Van Home or the Home of the Vanir\\" is described as located around the Don River (which Snorri writes was once called \\"Tana Fork\\" or \\"Vana Fork\\").Hollander (2007:6). Chapter 4 describes the √Üsir-Vanir War, noting that during a hostage exchange, the √Üsir sent the god H≈ìnir to Vanaheim and there he was immediately made chieftain.Hollander (2007:8). In chapter 15, the king Sveig√∞ir is recorded as having married a woman named Vana in \\"Vanaland\\", located in Sweden. The two produced a child, who they named Vanlandi (meaning \\"Man from the Land of the Vanir\\"McKinnell (2005:70)).Hollander (2007:15). Theories An attempt to illustrate Norse cosmology by Henry Wheaton (1831) The existence of Nine Worlds receive mention in some Old Norse texts. These worlds are nowhere specifically listed in sequence, but are generally assumed to include Vanaheimr. Henry Adams Bellows considers the other eight to be Asgard, √Ålfheimr, Midgard, J√∂tunheimr, Svart√°lfaheimr, Niflheim, M√∫spellsheimr, and possibly Ni√∞avellir.Bellows (1923:3). Hilda Ellis Davidson comments that exactly where Vanaheimr fall among the Nine Worlds isn't clear, since \\"the chief gods Freyr and Njord with a number of others, are represented along with the √Üsir in Asgard, but it seems probable that it was in the underworld.\\" Davidson notes a connection between the Vanir and \\"the land-spirits who dwelt in mounds and hills and in water [...].Davidson (1993:70). Rudolf Simek claims that Snorri \\"unquestionably\\" invented the name Vanaheimr as a Vanir counterpart to Asgard, but does not mention the Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l reference.Simek (2007:350).

A 20th-century Chinese novelist, cultural critic, and the Minister of Culture (1949‚Äì65), he is one of the most celebrated left-wing realist novelists of modern China. His most famous works are Ziye, a novel depicting life in cosmopolitan Shanghai, and Spring Silkworms. He also wrote many short stories. He adopted \\"Mao Dun\\" (), meaning \\"contradiction\\", as his pen name to express the tension in the conflicting revolutionary ideology in China in the unstable 1920s. His friend Ye Shengtao changed the first character from to , which literally means \\"thatch\\". Early life His father, Shen Yongxi () taught and designed the curriculum for his son, but he died when Mao Dun was ten. Mao Dun's mother Chen Aizhu () then became his teacher. He mentions in his memoirs that \\"my first instructor is my mother\\". Through learning from his parents, Mao Dun developed great interest in writing during his childhood. Mao Dun had already started to develop his writing skills when he was still in primary school. In one examination the examiner commented on Mao Dun's script: '12 year old young child, can make this language, not says motherland nobody'. There were other similar comments which indicate that Mao Dun had been a brilliant writer since his youth. While Mao Dun was studying in secondary school in Hangzhou, extensive reading and strict writing skills training filled his life. He read the Wen Xuan, Shishuo Xinyu, and a large number of classical novels, which influenced his writing style. Mao Dun entered the three-year foundation school offered by Peking University in 1913, in which he studied Chinese and Western literature. Due to financial difficulties, he had to quit in the summer of 1916, before his graduation. The trainings in Chinese and English as well as knowledge of Chinese and Western literature provided by the fifteen years of education Mao Dun received had prepared him to show up in the limelight of the Chinese journalistic and literary arena. Journalistic career After graduation, Mao Dun soon got his first job in the English editing and translation sections of the Commercial Press (), Shanghai branch. At the age of 21, he was invited to be the assistant editor of Xuesheng Zazhi () (Students' Magazine) under the Commercial Press, which had published many articles about the new ideologies that had emerged in China at that time. Apart from editing, Mao Dun also started to write about his social thoughts and criticisms. To some extent, he was inspired by the famous magazine New Youth. Like in 1917 and 1918, he wrote two editorials for Xuesheng Zazhi: Students and Society (Â≠∏ÁîüËàáÁ§æÊúÉ) and The Students of 1918, those were significant in stimulating political consciousness among the young educated Chinese. At 24 years of age, Mao Dun was already renowned as a novelist by the community in general, and in 1920, he and a group of young writers took over the magazine Xiaoshuo Yuebao (), which translated means \\"fiction monthly\\", to publish literature by western authors, such as Tolstoy, Chekhov, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, Byron, Keats, Shaw, etc., and make new theories of literature better known. Despite the fact that he was a naturalistic novelist, he admired writers like Leo Tolstoy, for their great artistic style. In 1920, he was invited to edit a new column: Xiaoshuo Xinchao () (The Fiction-New-Waves) in Xiaoshuo Yuebao. He even took up the post of Chief Editor of the Monthly in the same year and was obliged to reform it thoroughly, in response to the New Cultural Movement (). His young writer friends in Beijing supported him by submitting their creative writings, translating Western literature and their views on new literature theories and techniques to the magazines. Wenxue Yanjiuhui () (Literature Study Group) was formed partly because of this. The reformed Monthly was proved to be a success. It had facilitated the continuation of the New Cultural Movement by selling ten thousand copies a month and more importantly by introducing Literature for life, a brand new realistic approach to Chinese literature. In this period, Mao Dun had become a leading figure of the movement in the southern part of China. On the notion of content reformation, both the innovative and conservative parties in the Commercial Press could not make a compromise. Mao Dun resigned from the Chief Editor of Fiction Monthly in 1923, but in 1927 he became the chief columnist of the Minguo yuebao. He wrote more than 30 editorials for this newspaper to criticize Chiang Kai-shek, and to support revolutions. Political life Inspired by the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia, Mao Dun took part in the May Fourth Movement in China. In 1920, he joined the Shanghai Communist Team, and helped to establish the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. At first, he worked as a liaison for the party. He also wrote for the party magazine The Communist Party (). At the same time, Mao Dun participated in Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition (1926‚Äì28), the main purpose was to unite the country. He quit, however, when Chiang's Kuomintang broke with the Communists. In July 1928, he went to Japan in order to take refuge. As he returned to China in 1930, he joined the League of Left-Wing Writers. Later, China went to war with Japan and he actively engaged in resisting the Japanese attack in 1937. In 1949, the communist government took over and he was responsible for working as Mao Zedong's secretary and Culture Minister until 1964. As a literary man Xiaoshuo Yuebao Reform was Mao Dun's first contribution to Chinese literature. The magazine then became a place where \\"New Literature\\" circulated. Many famous writers like Lu Xun, Xu Dishan, Bing Xin, Ye Shengtao, had their works published through it. Mao Dun supported movements such as \\"New Literature\\" and \\"New Thinking\\". He believed that Chinese literature should have a place in the world. The experience of political conflict broadened his horizon in literature, therefore the theme of his later writing was mostly based on this. He then helped to found the League of Left-Wing Writers in 1930. After that, he worked together with Lu Xun to fight for the right of the society and the revolutionary movement in literature. The harvest period of Mao Dun's writing is considered to have been from 1927 to 1937. Shi, the first actual novel written by Mao Dun, was composed of three volumes, Huanmie (1927), Dongyao (1928), and Zhuiqiu (1928). It is the story of a generation of young intellectuals, who are caught up in the world of revolutionary fervor without a true understanding of the nature of social change. Mao Dun participated in Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition (1926‚Äì28) in an attempt to unite China, but this failed and he fled to Kuling, when the Kuomintang dissolved relations with the Chinese Communist Party. In the 1930s he was one of the key founders of the League of Left-Wing Writers, which was dissolved in a quarrel in 1936. Mao Dun's next major work was Hong (1929), which became famous for having no less than 70 main characters and numerous plot twists and turns. In 1933 came his next work, Midnight, which gained great popularity, to a point that it was also published in French and English, and it allowed to develop a sense of revolutionary realism. He left a work unfinished, the trilogy Shuangye Hongsi Eryuehua (1942). After the initiation of the Sino-Japanese War War in 1937, Mao traveled to many places and started a literary magazine in Wuhan. He edited the periodical Literary Front and the literary page of the newspaper Libao in Hong Kong and worked as a teacher. After 1943 Mao Dun did not produce any major works, but still wrote some articles and essays. In 1946 he visited the Soviet Union. In 1927, he published his first novel, Disillusion (). His most famous and important novel, Midnight (), was published in 1933. It is a naturalistic novel exploring the commercial world of Shanghai in detail. In addition, his fiction offered a sympathetic portrayal of working-class life and praise of revolution. When the People's Republic of China was established by the Communist Party of China in 1949, he became active on several committees and he worked as the Secretary and then the Minister of Culture for Mao Zedong until 1964. He started the monthly literary journal Chinese Literature, which became the most popular for western readers. He was dismissed from his position as minister in 1964 due to the ideological upheavals. Despite this fact, Mao Dun survived the Cultural Revolution and was afterwards rehabilitated. In the 1970s he became an editor of a children's magazine, and began working on his memoirs, which were serialized in the Party publication, the quarterly Xinwenxue Shiliao () (Historical Materials on New Literature), but he died on March 27, 1981 before he could finish it. His influence on Chinese literature continues to the present day because he used his savings to set up a fund called the Mao Dun Literature Scholarship to promote an atmosphere for writing fiction. Mao Dun's achievements in literature were also seen at his 50th birthday, which was also the 25th anniversary of his literary life. More than five hundred guests came to celebrate with him. Russian and American friends also joined the celebration. Wong Roufei wrote an essay as congratulations on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. Mao Dun's influence and achievements in the literary field were witnessed. On the other hand, he was twice elected as the chairman and then once elected as the vice-chairman of the China Literary Arts Representative Assembly. His status in the literary field has been highly recognized. Although he suffered great pain from illness in his old age, he still kept writing his memoirs, called The Road I Walked (). Besides his achievements, Mao Dun also had great influence on Chinese literature. The Mao Dun Literature Prize () was created due to Mao Dun's wish that outstanding novels should be encouraged and communist literature should be promoted. It is one of the most honorable literature awards in China. Many famous modern Chinese literary authors like Wei Wei () and Zhou Ke-qin () have received the prize.

He co-founded with Andr√© Breton and Philippe Soupault the surrealist review Litt√©rature. He was also a novelist and editor, a long-time member of the Communist Party and a member of the Acad√©mie Goncourt.  Early life (1897‚Äì1939)  Louis Aragon was born in Paris. He was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother, believing them to be his sister and foster mother, respectively. His biological father, Louis Andrieux, a former senator for Forcalquier, was married and thirty years older than Aragon's mother, whom he seduced when she was seventeen. Aragon's mother passed Andrieux off to her son as his godfather. Aragon was only told the truth at the age of 19, as he was leaving to serve in the First World War, from which neither he nor his parents believed he would return. Andrieux's refusal or inability to recognize his son would influence Aragon's poetry later on. Having been involved in Dadaism from 1919 to 1924, he became a founding member of Surrealism in 1924, with Andr√© Breton and Philippe Soupault under the pen-name \\"Aragon\\". In the 1920s, Aragon became a fellow traveller of the French Communist Party (PCF) along with several other surrealists, and joined the Party in January 1927. In 1933 he began to write for the party's newspaper, L'Humanit√©, in the \\"news in brief\\" section. He would remain a member for the rest of his life, writing several political poems including one to Maurice Thorez, the general secretary of the PCF. During the World Congress of Writers for the Defence of Culture (1935), Aragon opposed his former friend Andr√© Breton, who wanted to use the opportunity as a tribune to defend the writer Victor Serge, associated with Leon Trotsky's Left Opposition. Nevertheless, Aragon was also critical of the USSR, particularly after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1956) during which Joseph Stalin's personality cult was denounced by Nikita Khrushchev. The French surrealists had long claimed Lewis Carroll as one of their own, and Aragon published his translation of The Hunting of the SnarkLa Chasse au Snark, Pierre Seghers, Paris 1949 in 1929, \\"shortly before he completed his transition from Snarxism to Marxism\\", as Martin Gardner puts it.The Annotated Snark, edited by Martin Gardner, Penguin Books, 1974 Witness the key stanza of the poem in Aragon's translation: Gardner, who calls the translation \\"pedestrian\\" and deems the rest of Aragon's writings on Carroll's nonsense poetry full of factual errors, says that there is no evidence that Aragon intended any of it as a joke. = The Commune (1933‚Äì1939) = Apart from working as a journalist for L'Humanit√©, Louis Aragon also became, along with Paul Nizan, editor secretary of the journal Commune, published by the Association des √âcrivains et Artistes R√©volutionnaires (Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists), which aimed at gathering intellectuals and artists in a common front against fascism. Aragon became a member of the directing committee of the Commune journal in January 1937, along with Andr√© Gide, Romain Rolland and Paul Vaillant-Couturier. The journal then took the name of \\"French literary review for the defence of culture\\" (¬´ revue litt√©raire fran√ßaise pour la d√©fense de la culture ¬ª). With Gide's withdrawal in August 1937, Vaillant-Couturier's death in autumn 1937 and Romain Rolland's old age, Aragon became its effective director. In December 1938, he called as chief editor the young writer Jacques Decour. The Commune journal was strongly involved in the mobilization of French intellectuals in favor of the Spanish Republic. = Director of Ce soir (1937‚Äì1953) = In March 1937, Aragon was called on by the PCF to head the new evening daily, Ce soir, which he was charged with launching, along with the writer Jean-Richard Bloch. Ce soir attempted to compete with Paris-Soir. Outlawed in August 1939, Ce soir was re-opened after the Liberation, and Aragon again became its lead, first with Bloch then alone after Bloch's death in 1947. The newspaper, which counted Emile Dano√´n among its collaborators, closed in March 1953.  World War II (1939‚Äì1945)  In 1939 he married Russian-born author Elsa Triolet, the sister of Lilya Brik, a mistress and then partner of Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. He had met her in 1928, and she became his muse starting in the 1940s. Aragon and Triolet collaborated in the left-wing French media before and during World War II, going underground for most of the German occupation. Aragon was mobilized in 1939, and awarded the Croix de guerre (War Cross) and the military medal for acts of bravery. After the May 1940 defeat, he took refuge in the Southern Zone. He was one of several poets, along with Ren√© Char, Francis Ponge, Robert Desnos, Paul √âluard, Jean Pr√©vost, Jean-Pierre Rosnay, etc., to join the Resistance, both through literary activities and as an actual organizer of Resistance acts. Otto Abetz was the German governor, and produced a series of \\"black lists\\" of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi Occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. Aragon and Andr√© Malraux were both on these \\"Otto Lists\\" of forbidden authors.Moorehead, Caroline. 2011. A Train in Winter. Pages 21‚Äì22. During the war, Aragon wrote for the underground press Les √âditions de Minuit and was a member of the National Front Resistance movement. His poetry was published along texts by Vercors (Jean Bruller), Pierre Seghers or Paul Eluard in Switzerland in 1943 after being smuggled out of occupied France by his friend and publisher Fran√ßois Lachenal. He participated with his wife in the setting-up of the National Front of Writers in the Southern Zone. This activism led him to break his friendly relationship with Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, who had chosen Collaborationism. Along with Paul √âluard, Pierre Seghers and Ren√© Char, Aragon would maintain the memory of the Resistance in his post-war poems. He thus wrote, in 1954, Strophes pour se souvenir in commemoration of the role of foreigners in the Resistance, which celebrated the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans de la Main d'Oeuvre Immigr√©e (FTP-MOI). The theme of the poem was the Red Poster affair, mainly the last letter that Missak Manouchian, an Armenian- French poet and Resistant, wrote to his wife M√©lin√©e before his execution on 21 February 1944.M√©lin√©e Manouchian: Manouchian, EFR, Paris 1954 This poem was then set to music by L√©o Ferr√©.  After the war  At the Liberation, Aragon became one of the leading Communist intellectuals, assuming political responsibilities in the Comit√© national des √©crivains (National Committee of Writers). He celebrated the role of the general secretary of the PCF, Maurice Thorez, and defended the Kominform's condemnation of the Titoist regime in Yugoslavia. Sponsored by Thorez, Aragon was elected, in 1950, to the central committee of the PCF. His post, however, did not protect him from all forms of criticism. Thus, when his journal, Les Lettres fran√ßaises, published a drawing by Pablo Picasso on the occasion of Stalin's death in March 1953, Aragon was forced to make excuses to his critics, who judged the drawing iconoclastic. Through the years, he had been kept informed of Stalinist repression by his Russian-born wife, and so his political line evolved. = Les Lettres fran√ßaises (1953‚Äì1972) = In the days following the disappearance of Ce soir, in March 1953, Aragon became the director of L'Humanit√© 's literary supplement, Les Lettres fran√ßaises. Assisted by its chief editor, Pierre Daix, Aragon started in the 1960s a struggle against Stalinism and its consequences in Eastern Europe. He published the writings of dissidents such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or Milan Kundera. The monetary loss caused by Les Lettres fran√ßaises led to its ceasing publication in 1972. It was later re-founded. In 1956, Aragon supported the Budapest insurrection, provoking the dissolution of the Comit√© national des √©crivains, which Vercors quit. The same year, he was nevertheless granted the Lenin Peace Prize. He now harshly condemned Soviet totalitarianism, opened his magazines to dissidents, and condemned show trials against intellectuals (in particular the 1966 Sinyavsky-Daniel trial). He strongly supported the student movement of May '68, although the PCF was skeptical about it. The crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968 led him to a critical preface published in a translation of one of Milan Kundera's books (La Plaisanterie).French: ¬´ Et voil√† qu'une fin de nuit, au transistor, nous avons entendu la condamnation de nos illusions perp√©tuelles... ¬ª Despite his criticisms, Aragon remained an official member of the PCF's central committee until his death. = The publisher = Beside his journalistic activities, Louis Aragon was also CEO of the Editeurs fran√ßais r√©unis (EFR) publishing house, heir of two publishing houses founded by the Resistance, La Biblioth√®que fran√ßaise and Hier et Aujourd'hui. He directed the EFR along with Madeleine Braun, and in the 1950s published French and Soviet writers commonly related to the \\"Socialist Realism\\" current. Among other works, the EFR published Andr√© Stil's Premier choc, which owed to the future Goncourt Academician the Stalin Prize in 1953. But they also published other writers, such as Julius Fuƒç√≠k, V√≠tƒõzslav Nezval, Rafael Alberti, Y√°nnis R√≠tsos or Vladimir Mayakovsky. In the beginning of the 1960s, the EFR brought to public knowledge the works of non-Russian Sovietic writers, such as Tchinguiz A√Øtmatov, or Russian writers belong to the Khrushchev Thaw, such as Galina Nicola√´va, Yevgeny Yevtushenko's Babi Iar in 1967, etc. The EFR also published the first novel of Christa Wolf in 1964, and launched the poetic collection Petite sir√®ne, which collected works by Pablo Neruda, Eug√®ne Guillevic, Nicolas Guillen, but also less known poets such as Dominique Grandmont, Alain Lance or Jean Ristat. = Back to surrealism = Free from both his marital and editorial responsibilities (having ended publication of Les Lettres Fran√ßaises ‚Äî L'Humanit√©'s literary supplement ‚Äì in 1972), Aragon was free to return to his surrealist roots. During the last ten years of his life, he published at least two further novels: Henri Matisse Roman and Les Adieux. Louis Aragon died on 24 December 1982, his friend Jean Ristat sitting up with him. He was buried in the parc of Moulin de Villeneuve, in his property of Saint-Arnoult-en-Yvelines, alongside his wife Elsa Triolet. He was and still is a popular poet in France because many of his poems have been set to music and sung by various singers : Lino L√©onardi, H√©l√®ne Martin, L√©o Ferr√© (the first one to dedicate an entire LP to Aragon, with his 1961 breakthrough Les Chansons d'Aragon album), Jean Ferrat, Georges Brassens, Alain Barri√®re, Isabelle Aubret, Nicole Rieu, Monique Morelli, Marc Ogeret, et al. Many of his poems put into music by Jean Ferrat have been translated into German by Didier Caesar (alias Dieter Kaiser) and are sung by his Duo.

R. Skelton from Stories of Beowulf. Grendel is described as \\"Very terrible to look upon.\\" Grendel is a character in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf (AD 700‚Äì1000). He is one of the poem's three antagonists (along with his mother and the dragon), all aligned in opposition against the protagonist Beowulf. Grendel is feared by all in Heorot but Beowulf. A descendant of Cain, Grendel is described as \\"a creature of darkness, exiled from happiness and accursed of God, the destroyer and devourer of our human kind\\". He is usually depicted as a monster or a giant, although his status as a monster, giant, or other form of supernatural being is not clearly described in the poem and thus remains the subject of scholarly debate. The character of Grendel and his role in the story of Beowulf have been subject to numerous reinterpretations and re-imaginings. Story Beowulf's author often uses various substitute phrases for Grendel's name like this one, the mearc stapa (\\"mark-stepper\\"), an inhabitant of the borderland. Grendel is a character in the poem Beowulf, preserved in the Nowell Codex. Grendel, being cursed as the descendant of the Biblical Cain, is \\"harrowed\\" by the sounds of singing that come every night from the mead-hall of Heorot built by King Hrothgar. He is unable to bear it any more and attacks Heorot. Grendel continues to attack the Hall every night for twelve years, killing its inhabitants and making this magnificent mead-hall unusable. To add to his monstrous description the poet details how Grendel consumes the men he kills; \\"now that he could hope to eat his fill.\\" Beowulf hears of these attacks and leaves his native land of the Geats to destroy Grendel. He is warmly welcomed by King Hrothgar, who gives a banquet in celebration. Afterwards Beowulf and his warriors bed down in the mead hall to await the inevitable attack of the creature. Grendel stalks outside the building for a time, spying the warriors inside. He then makes a sudden attack, bursting the door with his fists and continuing through the entry. The first warrior Grendel finds is still asleep, so he seizes the man and devours him. Grendel grabs a second warrior, but is shocked when the warrior grabs back with fearsome strength. As Grendel attempts to disengage, the reader discovers that Beowulf is that second warrior. Beowulf uses neither weapon nor armor in this fight. He also places no reliance on his companions and had no need of them. He trusts that God has given him strength to defeat Grendel, whom he believes is God's adversary. Finally Beowulf tears off Grendel's arm, mortally wounding the creature. Grendel flees but dies in his marsh den. There, Beowulf later engages in a fierce battle with Grendel's mother, over whom he triumphs. Following her death, Beowulf finds Grendel's corpse and removes his head, which he keeps as a trophy. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the \\"ninth hour\\" (l. 1600, \\"n≈çn\\", about 3 pm). He returns to Heorot, where a grateful Hrothgar showers him with gifts. Scholarship =Tolkien= In 1936, J. R. R. Tolkien's Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics discussed Grendel and the dragon in Beowulf.Tolkien, J. R. R. \\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics.\\" In Daniel Donoghue (ed.), Beowulf a Verse Translation. Norton, 2002, pp. 103‚Äì130. Tolkien argues that \\"the evil spirits took visible shape\\" in Grendel and the dragon; however, the author's concern is focused on Beowulf.Tolkien, 2002, p. 119 He points out that while Grendel has Christian origins as the descendant of Cain, he \\"cannot be dissociated from the creatures of northern myth.\\"Tolkien, 2002, p. 122 He also argues for the importance of Grendel's role in the poem as an \\"eminently suitable beginning\\" that sets the stage for Beowulf's fight with the dragon: \\"Triumph over the lesser and more nearly human is cancelled by defeat before the older and more elemental.\\"Tolkien, 2002, p. 128. This essay was the first work of scholarship in which Anglo- Saxon literature was seriously examined for its literary merits ‚Äì not just scholarship about the origins of the English language, or what historical information could be gleaned from the text, as was popular in the 19th century. Tolkien wrote his own translation of Beowulf, entitled Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary together with Sellic Spell, between 1920 and 1926. =Physical description= During the decades following Tolkien's essay, the exact description of Grendel was debated by scholars. Indeed, because his exact appearance is never directly described in Old English by the original Beowulf poet, part of the debate revolves around what is known, namely his descent from the biblical Cain (the first murderer in the Bible). Grendel is called a sceadugenga ‚Äì \\"shadow walker\\", in other words \\"night goer\\" ‚Äì given that the monster was repeatedly described to be in the shroud of darkness.Thorpe, Anglo-Saxon Poems, p. 48Heyne, Beowulf, p. 129; p. 228, s.v. \\"genga\\"; p. 298, s.v. \\"scadu-genga\\" A visual interpretation is the depiction of Grendel in Robert Zemeckis's 2007 film Beowulf. Interpretations Some scholars have linked Grendel's descent from Cain to the monsters and giants of the Cain tradition. Seamus Heaney, in his translation of Beowulf, writes in lines 1351‚Äì1355 that Grendel is vaguely human in shape, though much larger: Heaney's translation of lines 1637‚Äì1639 also notes that Grendel's disembodied head is so large that it takes four men to transport it. Furthermore, in lines 983‚Äì989, when Grendel's torn arm is inspected, Heaney describes it as being covered in impenetrable scales and horny growths: Alfred Bammesgerber looks closely at line 1266 where Grendel's ancestry is said to be the \\"misbegotten spirits\\"Beowulf. Translated by Seamus Heaney. Norton Anthology of English Literature, 9th ed., vol. A, edited by Stephen Greenblatt, Norton, 2012, pp. 41‚Äì108 that sprang from Cain after he was cursed. He argues that the words in Old English, geosceaftgasta, should be translated \\"the great former creation of spirits\\".Bammesberger, Alfred. \\"Grendel's Ancestry\\". Notes & Queries, vol. 55, is. 3, 1 September 2008, pp. 257‚Äì260. . Peter Dickinson (1979) argued that seeing as the considered distinction between man and beast at the time the poem was written was simply man's bipedalism, the given description of Grendel being man-like does not necessarily imply that Grendel is meant to be humanoid, going as far as stating that Grendel could easily have been a bipedal dragon.Dickinson, Peter. The Flight of Dragons ch. 10 \\"Beowulf\\". New English Library, 1979. Other scholars such as Kuhn (1979) have questioned a monstrous description, stating: O'Keefe has suggested that Grendel resembles a berserker, because of numerous associations that seem to point to this possibility.Berserker Sonya R. Jensen argues for an identification between Grendel and Agnar, son of Ingeld, and suggests that the tale of the first two monsters is actually the tale of Ingeld, as mentioned by Alcuin in the 790s. The tale of Agnar tells how he was cut in half by the warrior Bothvarr Bjarki (Warlike little Bear), and how he died \\"with his lips separated into a smile\\". One major parallel between Agnar and Grendel would thus be that the monster of the poem has a name perhaps composed of a combination of the words gren and daelan. The poet may be stressing to his audience that Grendel \\"died laughing\\", or that he was gren- dael[ed] or \\"grin-divid[ed]\\", after having his arm torn off at the shoulder by Beowulf, whose name means bee-wolf or bear. Depictions Grendel appears in many other cultural works. Notes References * Jack, George. Beowulf : A Student Edition. Oxford University Press: New York, 1997. * Jensen, S R.

The cathedral is regarded as one of the leading examples of early English Gothic architecture. Its main body was completed in 38 years, from 1220 to 1258. Since 1549, the cathedral has had the tallest church spire in the United Kingdom, at . Visitors can take the \\"Tower Tour\\", in which the interior of the hollow spire, with its ancient wooden scaffolding, can be viewed. The cathedral has the largest cloister and the largest cathedral close in Britain at . It contains a clock which is among the oldest working examples in the world, and has the best surviving of the four original copies of Magna Carta. In 2008, the cathedral celebrated the 750th anniversary of its consecration. The cathedral is the mother church of the Diocese of Salisbury and is the seat of the Bishop of Salisbury, currently Nick Holtam. History Sculpture on the west front of the cathedral of Richard Poore who oversaw the early years of its construction, beginning in 1220. He is holding a model of the cathedral Plan showing the double transepts with aisles and extended east end, but not the cloisters or chapter house As a response to deteriorating relations between the clergy and the military at Old Sarum Cathedral, the decision was taken to re-site the cathedral, with the seat of the bishopric being moved to New Sarum, or Salisbury.Evans, p. 10-11 The move occurred during the tenure of Richard Poore, a rich man who gave the land on which the new cathedral was built. Construction was paid for by donations, principally from the canons and vicars of southeast England, who were asked to contribute a fixed annual sum until the building was completed.Evans, p. 13 A legend tells that the Bishop of Old Sarum shot an arrow in the direction he would build the cathedral; the arrow hit a deer, which died in the place where Salisbury Cathedral is now. The cathedral crossing, Old Sarum, and Stonehenge are reputed to be aligned on a ley line, although Clive L. N. Ruggles asserts that the site, on marshland, was chosen because a preferred site several miles to the west could not be obtained.Ruggles, Ancient Astronomy: An Encyclopedia of Cosmologies and Myth, 2005:225 \\"A notorious example...a ley line joining Stonehenge (third millennium B.C.E.), Old Sarum (first millennium B.C.E.), and Salisbury cathedral (C.E. 1220).\\" The foundation stones were laid on 28 April 1220 by William Longesp√©e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury and by Ela of Salisbury, 3rd Countess of Salisbury.The life of Ela, Countess of Salisbury Wiltshire and Swindon History CentreEvans, p. 15 Much of the freestone for the cathedral came from the Teffont Evias Quarry.Sylvanus Urban, wd., The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle (1830), p. 105 online at books.google.com As a result of the high water table on the new site, the cathedral was built on foundations only deep, and by 1258 the nave, transepts, and choir were complete. The only major sections begun later were the cloisters, added in 1240, the chapter house in 1263, the tower and spire, which at dominated the skyline from 1320. Because most of the cathedral was built in only 38 years, it has a single consistent architectural style, Early English Gothic. In total, 70,000 tons of stone, 3,000 tons of timber and 450 tons of lead were used in the construction of the cathedral. Although the spire is the cathedral's most impressive feature, it has proved troublesome. Together with the tower, it added 6,397 tons (6,500 tonnes) to the weight of the building. Without the addition of buttresses, bracing arches and anchor irons over the succeeding centuries, it would have suffered the fate of spires on other great ecclesiastical buildings (such as Malmesbury Abbey, 1180 to 1500; Lincoln Cathedral, 1311 to 1549; and Chichester Cathedral, 1402 to 1861) and fallen down; instead, Salisbury became the tallest church spire in the country on the collapse at Lincoln in 1549. The large supporting pillars at the corners of the spire are seen to bend inwards under the stress. The addition of reinforcing tie-beams above the crossing, designed by Christopher Wren in 1668, halted further deformation. The beams were hidden by a false ceiling installed below the lantern stage of the tower. Significant changes to the cathedral were made by the architect James Wyatt in 1790, including the replacement of the original rood screen and demolition of a bell tower which stood about northwest of the main building. Salisbury is one of only three English cathedrals to lack a ring of bells, the others being Norwich Cathedral and Ely Cathedral. However, its medieval clock does strike the time with bells every 15 minutes. = 21st century = In February 2016, the cathedral chapter placed Sophie Ryder's sculpture The Kiss straddling a path on the grounds where it was to remain until July. After only a few days, the work had to be moved, as pedestrians kept bumping into it while texting. On 25 October 2018, there was an attempted theft of Magna Carta from the cathedral; the alarms were triggered and a 45-year-old man was later detained on suspicion of attempted theft, criminal damage and possession of an offensive weapon. The outer layer of a double-layered glass case containing the document was broken, but the document suffered no damage. In January 2020 the perpetrator, Mark Royden, aged 47, from Kent, was found guilty of the attempted theft, which caused ¬£14,466 of damage, and guilty of criminal damage. Building and architecture =West front= The west front is of the screen-type, clearly deriving from that at Wells. It is composed of a stair turret at each extremity, with two niched buttresses nearer the centre line supporting the large central triple window. The stair turrets are topped with spirelets, and the central section is topped by a gable which contains four lancet windows topped by two round quatrefoil windows surmounted by a mandorla containing Christ in Majesty. At ground level there is a principal door flanked by two smaller doors. The whole is highly decorated with quatrefoil motifs, columns, trefoil motifs and bands of diapering. The west front was almost certainly constructed at the same time as the cathedral. This is apparent from the way in which the windows coincide with the interior spaces. The entire facade is about high and wide. It has been said that the front was built on a scale smaller than was initially planned. It lacks full- scale towers and/or spires as can be seen, for example at Wells, Lincoln, Lichfield, etc. The facade was disparaged by Alec Clifton-Taylor, who considered it the least successful of the English screen facades and a travesty of its prototype (Wells). He found the composition to be uncoordinated, and the Victorian statuary \\"poor and insipid\\". The front accommodates over 130 shallow niches of varying sizes, 73 of which contain a statue. The line of niches extends round the turrets to the north, south and east faces. There are five levels of niches (not including the mandorla) which show, from the top, angels and archangels, Old Testament patriarchs, apostles and evangelists, martyrs, doctors and philosophers and, on the lower level, royalty, priests and worthy people connected with the cathedral. The majority of the statues were placed during the middle of the 19th century, however seven are from the 14th century and several have been installed within the last decade. =Nave= The nave, with William Pye's decorative font visible in the foreground Salisbury Cathedral is unusual for its tall and narrow nave, which has visual accentuation from the use of light grey Chilmark stone for the walls and dark polished Purbeck marble for the columns. It has three levels: a tall pointed arcade, an open gallery and a small clerestory. Lined up between the pillars are notable tombs such as that of William Longesp√©e, half brother of King John and the illegitimate son of Henry II, who was the first person to be buried in the cathedral. Another unusual feature of the nave is an unconventional modern font, installed in September 2008. Designed by the water sculptor William Pye, it is the largest working font in any British cathedral, and replaced an earlier portable neo-Gothic Victorian font. The font is cruciform in shape, and has a 10-foot-wide vessel filled to its brim with water, designed so that the water overflows in filaments through each corner into bronze gratings embedded in the cathedral's stone floor. The project cost ¬£180,000 and was funded entirely by donations. Some parishioners reportedly objected to the new font, considering it 'change for change's sake', although Pye argued that the majority opinion was in favour: \\"I would say 90 per cent are in happy anticipation, five per cent are nervously expectant and five per cent are probably apoplectic\\". =Chapter house and Magna Carta= The medieval clock The chapter house is notable for its octagonal shape, slender central pillar and decorative medieval frieze. It was redecorated in 1855‚Äì9 by William Burges. The frieze, which circles the interior above the stalls, depicts scenes and stories from the books of Genesis and Exodus, including Adam and Eve, Noah, the Tower of Babel, and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The chapter house displays the best-preserved of the four surviving original copies of Magna Carta. This copy came to Salisbury because Elias of Dereham, who was present at Runnymede in 1215, was given the task of distributing some of the original copies. Elias later became a canon of Salisbury and supervised the construction of the cathedral. = Clock = The Salisbury Cathedral clock, which dates from about AD 1386, is supposedly the oldest working modern clock in the world. The clock has no face; all clocks of that date rang out the hours on a bell. It was originally located in a bell tower that was demolished in 1792. Following this demolition, the clock was moved to the Cathedral Tower, where it was in operation until 1884. The clock was then placed in storage and forgotten until it was discovered in an attic of the cathedral in 1928. It was repaired and restored to working order in 1956. In 2007, remedial work and repairs were carried out. Depictions in art, literature and television Salisbury Cathedral by John Constable, ca. 1825 \\"Salisbury cathedral\\" (2018) by Stephan Wolf The cathedral is the subject of famous paintings by John Constable. As a gesture of appreciation for John Fisher, Bishop of Salisbury, who commissioned this painting, Constable included the bishop and his wife in the canvas (bottom left). The view depicted in the paintings has changed very little in almost two centuries. The cathedral is apparently the inspiration for William Golding's novel The Spire, in which the fictional Dean Jocelin makes the building of a cathedral spire his life's work. The construction of the cathedral is an important plot point in Edward Rutherfurd's historical novel Sarum, which explores the historical settlement of the Salisbury area. The cathedral has been mentioned by the author Ken Follett as one of two models for the fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral in his historical novel The Pillars of the Earth. It was also used for some external shots in the 2010 miniseries based on Follett's book and was shown as it is today in the final scene. The cathedral was the setting for the 2005 BBC television drama Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle, written by Rhidian Brook and directed by Susanna White. Kevin McCloud climbed the cathedral in his programme called Don't Look Down! in which he climbed high structures to conquer his fear of heights. The cathedral was the subject of a Channel 4 Time Team programme which was first broadcast on 8 February 2009.

The artwork below the stained glass window is the temporary exhibition of Nicholas Pope installation called \\"The Apostles Speaking in Tongues Lit By Their Own Lamps\\", shown at Salisbury Cathedral from 8 June until 4 August 2014 =Organ= The cathedral's current organ was built in 1877 by Henry Willis & Sons. Walter Alcock, who was organist of the cathedral from 1916, oversaw a strictly faithful restoration of the famous Father Willis organ, completed in 1934,Webb, Stanley & Hale, Paul. \\"Alcock, Sir Walter\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 1 March 2012 even going to such lengths as to refuse to allow parts of the instrument to leave the cathedral in case any unauthorised tonal alterations were made without his knowledge,Alcock, W. G. \\"Salisbury Cathedral Organ\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 75, No. 1098 (August 1934), pp. 730‚Äì732 while allowing some discreet additions in the original style of the organ (as well as modernisation of the organ's actions) by Henry Willis III, the grandson of Father Willis.National Pipe Organ Register N10312 An earlier organ by Samuel Green was presented by George III in 1792 and was installed on top of the stone screen, which, unusually, did not divide the choir from the nave, but rather came from an unknown location in the cathedral. The organ was later taken out and moved to St Thomas's Church.Cathedrals; 2nd ed. London: Great Western Railway, 1925; p. 33. =Organists= It is recorded that in 1463 John Kegewyn was organist of Salisbury Cathedral. Among the notable organists of more recent times have been a number of composers and well-known performers including Bertram Luard-Selby, Charles Frederick South, Walter Alcock, David Valentine Willcocks, Douglas Albert Guest, Christopher Dearnley, Richard Godfrey Seal and the BBC presenter Simon Lole. =Choir= Salisbury Cathedral Choir holds annual auditions for boys and girls aged 7‚Äì9 years old for scholarships to Salisbury Cathedral School, which housed in the former Bishop's Palace. The boys' choir and the girls' choir (each 16 strong) sing alternate daily Evensong and Sunday Matins and Eucharist services throughout the school year. There are also many additional services during the Christian year particularly during Advent, Christmas, Holy Week, and Easter. The Advent From Darkness to Light services are the best known. Choristers come from across the country and some board. Six lay vicars (adult men) comprise the rest of the choir, singing tenor, alto and bass parts. In 1993, the cathedral was the venue for the first broadcast of Choral Evensong (the long-running BBC Radio 3 programme) to be sung by a girls' cathedral choir. Cathedral constables The cathedral previously employed five cathedral constables (known as \\"Close Constables\\"), whose duties mainly concerned the maintenance of law and order in the cathedral close. They were made redundant in 2010 as part of cost-cutting measures and replaced with \\"traffic managers\\". The constables were first appointed when the cathedral became a liberty in 1611 and survived until the introduction of municipal police forces in 1835 with the Municipal Corporations Act. In 1800 they were given the power, along with the city constables, to execute any justices' or court orders requiring the conveyance of prisoners to or from the county jail (at Fisherton Anger, then outside the city of Salisbury) as if it were the city jail (and, in so doing, they were made immune from any legal action for acting outside their respective jurisdictions). The right of the cathedral, as a liberty, to maintain a separate police force was conclusively terminated by the Local Government Act 1888.section 48(3) , Local Government Act 1888section 119(4) , Local Government Act 1888 Peregrine falcons Between 1864 and 1953, there were records of peregrine falcons being present at the cathedral. More arrived in 2013, and have been hatching every year since, with their nests on the cathedral's tower.
