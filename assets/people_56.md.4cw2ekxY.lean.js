Like the original Repository of 1810, Part Second used the four-shape system of Little and Smith in The Easy Instructor (Philadelphia, PA: 1801) to appeal to a wider audience; but its pioneering inclusion American folk tunes influenced all subsequent folk hymn, camp meeting, and shape note collections. Musicologist Warren Steel sees Wyeth's Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second as marking \\"the end of the age of New England composer-compilers (1770-1810) and the beginning of the age of southern collector-compilers (1816-1860).\\"David Warren Steel, \\"John Wyeth and the Development of Southern Folk Hymnody\\", Music from the Middle Ages Through the 20th Century: Essays in Honor of Gwynn McPeek, Carmelo P. Comberiati and Matthew C. Steel, eds. (London: Gordon & Breach, 1988), pp. 357-374. Available on-line at Biography John Wyeth was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the son of Ebenezer Wyeth, II, who fought at Bunker Hill, and Mary Wyeth, and the younger brother (by 12 years) of Joshua Wyeth who at the age of 16 participated in the Boston Tea Party. He learned printing through an apprenticeship. He worked as a printer in Santo Domingo. With the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution in 1791, he moved to Philadelphia, and finally settled in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In 1792 he became the publisher of a newspaper, The Oracle of Dauphin (Dauphin County).\\"The first number of _The Oracle of Dauphin and Harrisburg Advertiser_ was issued October 20, 1792, by John W. Allen and John Wyeth.\\" The bulk of the article relates to _The Harrisburgh Journal and the Weekly Advertiser_ , which preceded the _Oracle of Dauphin_ as the first Harrisburgh newspaper. The following year he was appointed postmaster by George Washington, but in 1798 John Adams, who saw a conflict of interest in having a newspaper man also act as postmaster, dismissed him, although they were both Federalists. There is no record of Wyeth having any musical training or activity, but he discovered a market for tunebooks (with printed music) of sacred music at a time when \\"hymnal\\" referred to a book with words only. In 1810 when he published Joseph Doll's Der leichte Unterricht in der Vokal Musik for the German-speaking market, and Wyeth’s Repository of Sacred Music, for moderate evangelical Christians. In 1813 he published a Second Part of the Repository of Sacred Music, containing songs for Methodists and Baptists. In 1818 he published Choral Harmonie enthaltend Kirchen-Melodien for German Lutherans. His wife was Louisa Wyeth (Weiss), together they had three children. His son Louis Wyeth (1812-1889) became a county judge of Marshall County, Alabama. Wyeth's Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second Although published in the north, Wyeth's Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second (1813), had a profound influence on Southern shape note tune-books. Of the 41 folk-hymns introduced here, 10 were used by Ananias Davisson in the Kentucky Harmony (1816), 20 by William Walker in the Southern Harmony (1835), and six in the Sacred Harp (1844).Recordings of one such anonymous folk tune, \\"Vienna\\" (p. 105 in Part Two) can be found on YouTube by searching for \\"Shenandoah Harmony 321b Vienna\\". The tune, now known as \\"Nettleton,\\" with the words \\"Come Thou Font Of Every Blessing\\" first appears here on page 112 in two parts (tenor and bass); it is now used in 397 hymnals. Note that the tune name used in the Repository is \\"Hallelujah,\\" which, being used in countless other tunes, was replaced by a distinctive name at some later time. One element of Part Second, the appearance of English hymnody, such as the ten tunes attributed to Martin Madan, was part of an on-going trend in the northern states,Irving Lowens, \\"Introduction\\" to Wyeth's Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second Irving Lowens, ed. (New York: Da Capo Press, 1964), p. xiv. but ignored by Southern tunebook compilers, who increasingly turned to regional folk tunes as sources of inspiration. Lack of musical training John Wyeth describes his musical qualifications in the last sentence of the Preface to the first part of the Repository: > In short, if many years attention to the charms of church music, if an > extensive acquaintance with the taste of teachers of the first emininence in > the United States, and with the possession of some thousand pages of > selected music to cull from, be considerations, which may added to the merit > of the editor's undertaking... Wyeth does not claim any musical training or attendance at one of the singing schools typical of the time; he limits himself to (1) liking church music; (2) knowing the \\"taste\\" of teachers (but not studying under them), and (3) owning a collection of books from which to cull. Musicologist Irving Lowens suggests that his motivations may have been strictly business.Irving Lowens, \\"Introduction\\" to Wyeth's Repository of Sacred Music, Irving Lowens, ed. (New York: Da Capo Press, 1974), p. vii. Ross Ellison mentions the shrewdness in discovering a newly emerging musical market (revival music and camp meeting songs) as the significance of Wyeth's his contribution to American music.\\"John Wyeth has earned a niche in the history of American music not because he was a musician, but rather because he was a shrewd enough publisher to recognize the cultural and musical forces at work in Pennsylvania...\\" Ross W. Ellison, \\"John Wyeth, Early American Tunebook Publisher\\", The American Music Teacher, Vol. 25, No. 1, (Sep 1, 1975), p. 22. Warren Steel qualifies this assessment by drawing attention to the fact that Wyeth grew up in the Boston-Cambridge area at a time when singing-schools were popular, and when William Billings and others were creating American choral music. The lack of musical skills did not matter for the original Repository, in which Wyeth merely reprinted material from earlier, successful publications. The innovative aspects of Part Second are attributed Elkanah Kelsey Dare, who was hired as music-editor, and contributed 16 of his own compositions (his entire known work). Dare may have been assisted by others, but their names have not been recorded.  References  External links * John Wyeth page on ChoralWiki.

Russell Dermond was found dead on May 6, 2014, in the garage of the house he owned next to Lake Oconee in Putnam County, Georgia. His body had been decapitated when it was found, and his head could not be found in the house. Russell's wife, Shirley Dermond, could not be located in the house either. More than a week later, her body was discovered at the bottom of Lake Oconee, about five miles from her house. She appeared to have died from a blow to her head, and her body had been weighted down with concrete blocks. Unlike her husband, she had not been decapitated. At the time of their deaths, Russell was 88 years old and Shirley was 87. As of August 2020, the murders have remained unsolved, and Russell's head still had not been found.  Background  Russell Dermond was originally from Hackensack, New Jersey. He served in the United States Navy during World War II. He married Shirley on December 15, 1950. They went on to have four children and nine grandchildren. After working in the fast food industry, including owning several Hardee's locations in Atlanta, he retired in 1994. Russell and Shirley went on to move to the Great Waters Reynolds Lake Oconee gated community, about 12 miles northeast of Eatonton. In 2000, their oldest son Mark was killed in Atlanta while attempting to purchase crack cocaine. Investigators believe that there is no connection between this crime and the subsequent murder of Mark's parents. Russell Dermond was last seen alive on May 1, 2014, running errands at a grocery store and bank in Eatonton. Along with Shirley, he spoke with his son, Brad, over the phone later that day. Russell and Shirley were expected to attend a party for the 2014 Kentucky Derby the following weekend with their neighbors, who grew concerned when the Dermonds did not show up. On May 6, one of their neighbors went to the Dermonds' house to check on them. The neighbor found the door unlocked and went on to enter the house. Russell's dead, decapitated body was found on the floor of his two-car garage, lying in a small pool of blood. When police were unable to locate Shirley at the house, they initially suspected that she had been kidnapped. Ten days later, her body was found by fishermen on Lake Oconee. A subsequent autopsy found that she had died from either two or three deep wounds to the head from a blunt object.  Investigations  Initially, investigators were pursuing multiple potential leads to find the perpetrator (or perpetrators) and their motive for killing the Dermonds. However, this eventually led nowhere, and over time the leads gradually declined in frequency. Although the perpetrator and motive remain unknown, Putnam County sheriff Howard Sills has said he is convinced that multiple people were involved. Because gunshot residue was found on Russell's collar, Sills also believes that Russell was decapitated after having been shot in the head in an attempt to prevent police from finding the bullet, and that the perpetrators went to the Dermonds' home intending to obtain money, despite the fact that nothing in the home was stolen.

It has smooth grey bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine, white flowers and cylindrical to urn-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus rowleyi is a mallee that grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth grey to tan, and cream-coloured when new. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are dull bluish green, egg-shaped, up to long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, mostly long and wide. The flower buds are borne in groups of seven or nine on a thickened peduncle long, the individual flowers on pedicels long. Mature buds are club-shaped, wide with a conical operculum long. The flowers are white and the fruit are cylindrical to urn-shaped, long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus rowleyi was first formally described in 2012 by Dean Nicolle and Malcolm E. French from material collected north of Newman by Ian Brooker in 1983. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (rowleyi) honours Bruce Rowley, an expert desert traveller who first discovered the Little Sandy Desert population of this species. Distribution and habitat This mallee usually grows on broad floodplains or in open mallee vegetation. It is only known from the area between Marble Bar, Newman and the Rudall River National Park in the Little Sandy Desert and Pilbara biogeographic regions. Conservation status This mallee is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

Birch (born Leann Elsie Traub; – ) was an American developmental psychologist, best known for her research on children's eating behaviours.  Biography  Birch was born in Owosso, Michigan, and grew up primarily in Southern California. She obtained a bachelor's degree in psychology from California State University at Long Beach in 1971. She completed her graduate studies in psychology at the University of Michigan, earning a master's degree in 1973 and a PhD in 1975. From 1972 to 1992, Birch was a faculty member at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where she headed the Department of Human Development and Family Studies. In 1992, she became a professor and department head at Pennsylvania State University, where she remained for 21 years. At Penn State, she was the director of the Center for Childhood Obesity Research. In 2014, she joined the faculty at the Department of Foods and Nutrition at the University of Georgia. Birch authored more than 250 publications that have been cited over 51,000 times. She served on a number of committees dedicated to obesity prevention, including a term as the chair of the Committee on Obesity Prevention Policies for Young Children at the Institute of Medicine from 2009 to 2011. Her research program is credited for its influence on policy and position statements from scientific and professional bodies, such as the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Healthy Eating Research program. Birch was married to Karl Newell and had two children, Charlotte and Spencer. She died on May 26, 2019, in Durham, North Carolina, at the age of 72.  Research  Birch is credited with being a pioneer in the field of childhood eating behavior. She conducted research on a number of subtopics within this area, including selective eating, parental influences on eating behaviors, and psychological aspects of obesity, from infancy through adolescence. One line of Birch's research examined children's food-related neophobia, the fear or dislike of novel items. She demonstrated that with repeated exposure, children can learn to like previously rejected foods, such as vegetables. Birch co-led a project evaluating an intervention designed to teach first-time parents effective ways to respond to their infants' needs, aside from feeding. At three years old, children in the intervention group had lower BMIs, compared to children in a control group, and a smaller proportion who could be categorized as overweight or obese. This research was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

He was prolific even while he was behind bars many times.Choi, Jaebong. “Deceased Cho Taeil, Who Resisted Dictatorship with His Bold Yet Poetic Voice,” Hankyoreh Shinmun. September 9, 1999. He published a poetry collection, Gukto (국토 National Territory) in 1975, but it was banned right away. In 1977, he led the publication of Yang Seongu's poetry collection, Gyeoulgonghwaguk (겨울 공화국 Winter Republic) where Park Chung- hee's dictatorship was compared with a winter republic, for which he and Ko Un were arrested.Jeong, Sunhyeong. “Late Cho Taeil Who Lived Like a Wild Flower Unyielding to Irrationality,” Gimhae News. January 15, 2019. http://www.gimhaenews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25894 In 1978, the banned poetry collection, National Territory, was translated into Japanese and published by Likasyobo as part of the series of Korean modern poetry, which made him famous for a resistance poet. In 1979 when he had a drinking bout on a rooftop and loudly criticized Park Chunghee and the Yushin dictatorship, he was arrested and put in jail. He was released after 29 days and this has been referred to as Cho Taeil's rooftop event.Lee, Eunbong. “Cho Taeil,” Literary History through a Biographic Sketch, Vol 2. Somyeong, 2008. In 1980, he tried to issue a statement to request the lifting of martial law but he was sentenced 2 years in prison for violation of martial law.“Dismissal of Appeal for Cho Taeil Who Violated Martial Law,” Dong-A Ilbo.

After he became a professor of creative writing in Gwangju University since 1989, he worked on writing poetry as well as poetic theories. Hedied of liver cancer in 1999.Wikipedia. https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A1%B0%ED%83%9C%EC%9D%BC That year, he received a posthumous award. In 2001, the memorial stone for the poem, “Pulssi (Grass Seed)” was set up in Gwangju, and in 2003, Cho Taeil Poetry Literature Hall was built. In 2004, an anthology, Naneun noraega doieotta (나는 노래가 되었다 I Became a Song), edited by Shin Kyeongrim was published. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of his death, the Cho Taeil Literary Award was founded in 2019.Ko, Seonju. “Literary Award Established to Commemorate Cho Taeil,” Kwangnam Ilbo.

Representing his earlier poetry, Theory of Kitchen Knife was considered as a remarkable accomplishment of the 1970s’ poetry that reflected the society.Yu, Seongho. Encyclopedia of Korean Culture. https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/SearchNavi?keyword=%EC%A1%B0%ED%83%9C%EC%9D%BC&ridx;=2&tot;=4 The kitchen knife is a tool to fight against the lack of political freedom as well as a tool to raise self-awareness. At the same time, it does not belong to one person but it is a weapon that can be shared.Doopedia. https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1208028&cid;=40942&categoryId;=39201 He considered the public to be an agent of historical development and focused on the public awareness. In that regards, the series of “Theory of Kitchen Knife” particularly shed light on the rage of the public. The rage of the public is ethical conduct that can be justified as lawful resistance of the oppressed.Lim, Jiyeon. “The Concept of People’ s Poetry and Its Masculinity of Cho Tae-il,” Research on Korean Language and Literature, Vol 61, Society of Korean Language and Literature, 2018: 152-155. Through the poetry collection, National Territory (1975), he bluntly criticized the filthy reality compared with the national territory that is filled with freedom and love. In “Gukto seosi (국토 서시 National Territory Prologue),” the grass and stones refer to the public and he depicts the endless vitality of the public.Mun, Heungsul. “Criticism on Irrational Reality and Pursuit of Primitive Living World: The Study on Jo Tae-Il's Poems,” Literature and Environment, Vol. 6 No. 1, Association for the Study of Literature and Environment, 2007: 40-41. Indirect Criticism and Nature-Oriented Tendency His straightforward criticism during the Yushin era turned into a metaphorical form in Gageodo (가거도 Gageodo Island) (1983). He said “The spring has not come yet” in “Bomsomun (봄소문 A Rumor of Spring)” as the Yushin dictatorship was replaced with another military dictatorship. In 1980, witnessing the brutal massacre in Gwangju, he described his rage and frustration that was “burning from deep inside” in a low tone (“Sorideul bunnohanda (소리들 분노한다 Voices Enraged)”).Mun, Heungsul. “Criticism on Irrational Reality and Pursuit of Primitive Living World: The Study on Jo Tae-Il's Poems,” Literature and Environment, Vol. 6 No. 1, Association for the Study of Literature and Environment, 2007: 42~45. His poetry of the late 1980s remarkably changed to highlight communion with nature in an effort to sublimate anguish.Kim, Kwangho. “Cho Taeil, a Poet Who Led Resistance to Yushin, Passed Away,” Kyunghyang Shinmun.

Fluent in all areas of the Talmud, halakha (Jewish law), and hashkafa (Orthodox Jewish worldview), he was the general editor of the 73-volume Schottenstein Edition of the Babylonian Talmud published by ArtScroll. After making aliyah to Israel, he became the Rav of Beis Tefillah Yonah Avraham, an English-speaking congregation for Anglo olim in Ramat Beit Shemesh, which he led for 17 years. Early life and education Chaim Zev Malinowitz was born in 1952 on the Lower East Side of New York City. His father, Rabbi Avrohom Aharon Malinowitz, had been a student of Aharon Kotler in Kletsk, Poland (now Belarus). Malinowitz was a gifted student at Rabbi Jacob Joseph School. After his bar mitzvah, he was accepted to the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia where, albeit younger than the other students, he skipped two grades and was accepted to the beth midrash (undergraduate-level) program under Rabbi Mendel Kaplan. His desire to have more time for study led him to begin awakening at 4 a.m. and praying vasikin, the pre-dawn prayer, a practice he maintained for the rest of his life. He next studied at Yeshivas Iyun HaTalmud in Monsey, New York, under Rabbi Abba Berman, a main disciple of Rabbi Yerucham Levovitz. He remained at this yeshivah for six years, until his marriage in 1976, whereupon he entered the kollel. In 1980, he was appointed by Berman to take over as rosh kollel when Berman made aliyah to Israel. In the early 1970s, Malinowitz also studied the Tanya in a late-night shiur given by Chabad rabbi Yoel Kahn. Rabbinic career After receiving rabbinic ordination from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Malinowitz served as a dayan (rabbinical court judge) for the rabbinical court of Kollel HaRabbanim in Monsey. In this role, he became known as a \\"world authority on gittin\\" (Jewish divorce) and also dealt with cases of agunos. He staunchly opposed the 1992 New York Get Law proposed by Jewish activist groups, which would penalize husbands who refused to grant their wives a get by making it difficult for them to arrange a civil divorce. Malinowitz contended that the coercive element of the penalty could halakhically invalidate all divorces in New York. Ultimately, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach's decision on the matter, which agreed with Malinowitz's position, eroded support for the law. In 1992 Malinowitz was appointed, along with Rabbi Yisrael Simcha Schorr, as general editor of the Schottenstein Edition of the Babylonian Talmud published by ArtScroll. The English-language Schottenstein Talmud spanned 73 volumes and was completed over a period of 15 years. Malinowitz was responsible for approving \\"every single line and every single footnote\\" of the translation and commentary of the Talmud submitted by the editorial staff for both the English and Hebrew editions. According to a senior editor on the project, Rabbi Eliezer Herzka: \\"His role was to learn through the sugya [topic] with the ArtScroll commentary to probe it to find its weak points\\". Herzka explained that Malinowitz's knowledge of the Talmud was so broad that he would know when the present sugya inadequately covered important opinions by the classic Talmudic commentators that were cited in similar sugyas elsewhere in Talmud. Nothing was considered final until Malinowitz approved the finished draft. Malinowitz also worked on ArtScroll's elucidated Mishnah project. He continued his association with ArtScroll after making aliyah in 1997. Upon moving to Israel, Malinowitz began to teach at Yeshivat Aish HaTorah. In 2002, he was hired as Rav of Beis Tefillah Yonah Avraham in Ramat Beit Shemesh, an English-speaking congregation catering to Anglo olim. As a community rav, Malinowitz introduced many shiurim to the synagogue schedule, including classes on different subjects and at different levels for men, women, and children. He also studied one-on-one with many congregants. Personal qualities Malinowitz was fluent in all areas of the Talmud, halakha (Jewish law), and hashkafa (Orthodox Jewish worldview). He combined this knowledge with \\"fearlessness\\" to act on his convictions and a strong desire for truth. At the same time, he was regarded as a friendly, \\"down to earth\\" personality who cared for others. Personal life Malinowitz married Simi Maza, daughter of Rabbi Dovber Maza, a Torah educator, in 1976. The couple had six sons and four daughters. After making aliyah, they resided in Jerusalem. Malinowitz died in Jerusalem on November 21, 2019 at the age of 67. He was buried in the Rechovot cemetery near his parents.

He was a professor of medicine for decades, and after he retired, he actively published poetry collections and received many literary awards. His poems contemplate nature, reason history and explore the source of existence.  Life  =Youth= He was born in 1932 in Daegu. When he was a teenager, he wanted to be a physicist after seeing a Japanese physicist, Hideki Yukawa, receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering neutrons, determined to surpass Japan as a scientist. But he faced his own limitation and gave up on physics and went to a medical school, instead. He became seriously interested in literature as he took a literary class at college. What made him attracted to poetry was the fact that it allowed him to explore a world beyond the cause-and-effect relationship, as opposed to pathology that is a mechanism separating self and the other. Particularly, he was immerged in reading Rilke’s poems and studied the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, deeply plunging into existentialism.Jo, Yongho. “The Power of Poetry is in Isolation – Appreciation to the edge of Mind,” Segye Ilbo. June 25, 2018. http://www.segye.com/newsView/20180625004491?OutUrl=naver =Works after his debut= He debuted as a poet in 1957 when he received recommendation for his poems “Gwasil (과실 Fruits),” “Nalgae (날개 Wings)” and “Kkot (꽃 Flowers).” But after his first poetry collection, Haejo (해조 Seaweeds) was published in 1969, he stopped writing poems for about 30 years. It was because he focused on his career as a professor of a medical school while doing research on pathology for decades after he graduated from college with honors. When he retired from the professorship, he actively began to release poetry colletions.Jo, Yongho. “The Power of Poetry is in Isolation – Appreciation to the edge of Mind,” Segye Ilbo. June 25, 2018. As soon as his second collection, Bineun sujikeuro seoseo jungneunda (비는 수직으로 서서 죽는다 Rain Falls Plumb Down), was released in 1999, he received favorable comments from the literary critics and the media and won many literary awards for his collections he published for the next 3–4 years.Yun, Yeojin “Heo Manha’s 7th Collection: More Passionate for Writing Poetry Right Before He Becomes 90,” Busan Ilbo. July 17, 2018. He published many poetry collections including Yasaengui kkot (야생의 꽃 Wild Flowers) (2006), Badaui seongbun (바다의 성분 What the Ocean Consists of) (2009) and an essay collection titled Cheongmapunggyeong (청마풍경 Landscape with a Blue Horse) (2005).  Writing  =Science meets art= The basic of pathology, observation and analysis, is the framework of Heo’s poetry.Heo, Manja. Book Review in Camels Can Smell Water from Far Away. Sol, 2000. His poems often use a motif of vast nature, such as a stratum, cliff, slope, fossil and the ocean, which has been preserved from time immemorial. In the poem, “Haejo (해조 Seaweed)” in Seaweeds (1969), he is reminded of the time when he served in the Korean War while seeing the seaweeds that has dried up on rocks. In another poem, “Jicheung (지층 Strata),” he traces the chronicle of human beings who have fought with stone axes since the primitive ages.Choi, Rayoung. “A Study on the Poetics of Hur Man-Ha - Focused on ‘the World with Will’ and the ‘Aesthetic Intuition’” Comparative Literature, Vol. 77, 2019. His imagination that arises from his observing nature and tracing the history back to the origins is supported by a wealth of scientific knowledge. For example, in “Donggiui bawi (동기의 바위 Sibling’s Rock)” in Wild Flowers (2006), he illustrates rocks in association with siblings based on the proportion of silicon in his blood. And given the fact that the iron in human’s blood is red, he says that the sunset of the Paleozoic era flows in his blood vessel. Like this, Heo has established a distinguished poetic world of his own based on scientific knowledge and his literary imagination beyond that.Choi, Rayoung. \\"A Study on the Poetics of Hur Man-Ha - Focused on 'the World with Will' and the 'Aesthetic Intuition'\\" Comparative Literature, Vol. 77, 2019. =Language of verticality= As time passes, nature is continuously created and disappears. Rain Falls Plumb Down (1999) illustrates his sense of futility as anything on earth is present temporarily and ceases to exist after all. However, raindrops disappear in vain, yet, leave rain prints behind on rocks. In “Ujue mongmareum (우주의 목마름 Thirst of the Universe)” the poets reads the last will of life carved by raindrops as he watches rain prints from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era. And by capturing the ephemeral existence of an object, the poet tries to give meaning to the things becoming extinct. Just like a bird that soars up vertically against gravity, he also dreams of poetic ascent beyond the principle of causality of this world.Song, Seungwhan. \\"A Study on Heo Man Ha's Poetry,\\" The Studies of Korean Literature, Vol. 26, 2009. In order to penetrate into an object and testify its fundamental being, a poet needs to discover a new language. Heo rules out cliché and an ordinary language and explores existence by defamiliarizing language.Heo, Manha. Book Review in Starlight before Language, Sol, 2018 In the title poem, \\"Siui gyejeoleun gyeoulida (시의 계절은 겨울이다 The Season of Poetry is Winter)\\" of the poetry collection with the same title, the poet describes himself as a “fragile language that seeks for the world’s extreme.” It is natural that “the season of poetry is winter” because poetry always leaves its center to be headed for the periphery. However, the poet believes that his language sprouts out just like grass in spring.Heo, Manha.

At the end of 2008 he was appointed Chief Rabbi of the Netherlands, this appointment includes all the municipalities of the Netherlands, except the cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague.  Biography  Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs is a descendant of an old Dutch Jewish family. His parents were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, his two parents were survivors of the Shoah and World War II. After completing his secondary education, Jacobs studied at the yeshiva (Talmudic academy) of Brunoy in France. Jacobs obtained his semicha (rabbinical ordination) from Rabbi Isser Yehuda Unterman, the Chief Rabbi of Eretz Israel, the highest rabbinical authority in Jewish law (Halacha), and Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg, a prominent rabbi in Israel. Jacobs is the Chief Rabbi of the Netherlands, the president of the rabbinical school of the Netherlands, and the rabbi of the Sinai Center located in Amstelveen, the only Jewish psychiatric center in Europe, with more than 3,000 patients. When on March 17, 2019, the victims of the terrorist and Islamophobic attacks against two mosques located in Christchurch, New Zealand, were commemorated at the Dam Square in Amsterdam, Jacobs was one of the speakers, when he spoke, a small group of pro- palestinian protesters turned their backs on him. The Chief Rabbi is a member of the Chabad-Lubavitch chassidim. They are known for their openness to the non-religious Jewish community. Jacobs is vice president of the local cheder, a traditional Jewish school located in Amsterdam. An abuse case took place at this school in 2012, which in 2018 resulted in the conviction of a teacher involved in the events. When the case broke out, the municipalities of Rotterdam and The Hague supported Jacobs, as well as the supreme rabbinate. Since then, relations with the rabbinate have improved due to several changes in municipal management. After May 4, 2019, the chief rabbi advocated the appointment of a national coordinator against antisemitism. Jacobs has been able to build an extensive network of friendship and cooperation with several churches, especially with the christian community: Orthodox, protestant and roman catholic alike. Jacobs has participated in the organization of many exhibitions about Judaism On April 27, 2012, the Chief Rabbi Jacobs was appointed officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau.

Image 15. 5 October 1922, p. 15. '''  History  Finkenberg’s Sons Furniture Inc. was a furniture department store chain founded in Manhattan in 1870, and by 1940, the company expanded across New York City, becoming one of the largest furniture retail chains in the New York metropolitan area. After Adolph Finkenberg’s death in 1914, the firm was managed by his four eldest sons: Edward, Sam, Frederick, and Israel. In 1919, access to the corporate headquarters, located on 2279 Third Avenue, was impeded by the closure of the ferry line between Yorkville, Manhattan and Queens. As a result, the company’s President, Frederick Finkenberg, was appointed to the board of the Triborough Bridge and tasked with creating an additional gateway into Manhattan. A decade later, as the Triborough Bridge’s Reception Committee Chairman, Finkenberg assisted in the organization of the bridge’s dedication ceremony, attended by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, and Governor Herbert Lehman. Finkenberg’s Sons opened its flagship store in 1927, which encompassed a five-story building that expanded the entire block across from Bloomingdale's. “A. Finkenberg’s Sons to Open New 59th St. Store To-day.” New York Herald Tribune. 26 Nov 1927, p. 9. It was at this location that the first Jumbo Philco, billed as the world's largest radio, was on display for public viewing. Finkenberg’s Sons Furniture continued to thrive despite the Great Depression. In 1938, the company opened a store across the Hudson River, and a year later, an expansive outlet was added to the chain's mantel, located on 36th Street and Eighth Avenue. Finkenberg’s Sons introduced a novel layaway plan to the United States and was known for its motto: “Friendly credit since 1870.” During a 1941 broadcast on Philco Playhouse Network, Finkenberg’s Sons Inc. was recognized for its innovative financing. “The Corner Store: Spanish Harlem Furniture Store Provides Credit, Plus High Prices and Hard Dunning.” Wall Street Journal, 28 Aug. 1970, p. 24.“Retailers Hear Attack on Costs of Government: W. Reyburn Asks Association to Compel Economics as Business Aid Holds Veterans Need Aid Commence Idea For Study; Questions View of Young.” New York Tribune, 6 Feb. 1931, p. 19. In 1948, Finkenberg’s Sons was sold and renamed Finkenberg’s Furniture Co, and the furniture chain's midtown location, between 58th and 59th Streets and Lexington and Third Avenues, was transformed into Alexander's Department Store. Adolph Finkenberg was a founding member of New York City’s Temple Israel, contributed to helping orphans, “Jewish Charities Fund Increased to 84,437,000.\\" New York Herald Tribune. 2 Dec 1931, p.8. and sheltered African Americans during New York City's race riots in the early 1900s.

Bashkir encyclopedia.  Biography  Family tree of Akmulla Census form with data of Akmulla, 1850 Born 14 December 1831 in the village of Tuhanbay, Kulil-Minsk volost Belebeyovskiy uyezd Orenburg province (currently the Miyakinsky district of the Republic of Bashkortostan). According to the census documents of the 19th century, the father is Kamaletdin Iskuzhin (born in 1805), the designated imam, and his mother is Bibiummugulsum Salimyanova (born in 1809), both are Bashkirs - the heirs of the Kulil-Minsky volost Belebeyevsky uyezd] (from the Bashkir clan Meng). According to Kazakh researchers, the father of Akmulla is Kazakh Muhammedyar. Riza Fakhretdin writes that the father of Akmulla was a Bashkir, and his mother was from “Kazan citizens” (one of the names of the Tatars)». The future poet received primary education in his native village, studied in madrasah of the neighboring villages of Menouztamak and Anyasovo. In the mid-1850s he was a shakird of a madrassah (school) in the village of Sterlibashevo, where he received lessons from the famous Sufi poet Shamsetdin Zeki. Subsequently, Akmulla lived and worked in different places. He taught children, was engaged in various crafts, in particular, worked as a carpenter, and also became known as a talented poet-improviser. Friendship with a Muslim religious figure Zaynulla Rasulev played a large role in his formation as a philosopher. Unable to live in one place, at 25 he went to travel. In 1859 Miftakhetdin still lived in his father’s family at the age of 28 . Then Akmulla traveled to the south of the historical Bashkortostan, and then to the Trans-Urals. Miftahetdin Akmulla on his cart, in special compartments of which he kept books and manuscripts, carpentry and other tools, roamed the Bashkir villages of the upper reaches of the Ural River, the Agideli River, the Miass River Valley, and also in the steppes Kazakhstan, distributing among people humanistic ideas, including the views of Tatar enlighteners.To the 185th anniversary of the birth of the outstanding poet and educator Bashinform news Agency. 2016-12-14 All year round he traveled from one village to another, on Sabantuy competed with famous sesens (poets) in the art of poetic improvisation, and also read his poems to the people (Turkic peoples are very fond of poetry). According to the denunciation of the Kazakh Batuch Isyangildin was he convicted of evading military service in the imperial army and for four years (1867–1871) was in Trinity Prison. Akmulla created many well-known works in prison: “My place is in prison” ( “Maekamym mineng - zindan” ) and others. The reason for Miftahetdin’s imprisonment was, according to researchers, the fact that he was considered to be a Bashkir hiding from military service among Kazakhs. Only the intercession of the rich Kazakh Mukhamedyar helped him to be released. Among Kazakhs, Miftakhetdin was known as a sage and akyn (poet), was engaged in craft, taught children. He participated in aitysh (poetry competitions), which were arranged among the Kazakhs. Miftahetdin was twice married. The first wife died in his native village, after which Akmulla left his native village. The second wife of the poet was Safia daughter of Yuldybai from the village of Suleiman (Uchalinsky district of Bashkortostan). The young woman suffered from a lack of her own housing, constant moving, and when they ended up in her native land, she ran away from her husband. A Muslim court allowed a woman to leave her husband because he led the life of a wanderer. Akmulla’s death was unexpected and tragic. On the night of on the road from Troitsk to Zlatoust near the Miass Plant near the railway station Syrostan was killed. Buried in a Muslim cemetery Miass.Tatar electronic library  Creativity  According to Bashkir scholars, Akmulla created most of his works in Bashkir and Kazakh languages, as well as in the Türkic language, which served as a common language for the Türkic peoples. According to researchers of Old Tatar literature, the language of most Akmullah's works is mixed Kazakh-Tatar, since it combines elements of both languages. Before the October Revolution 1917, his books were published in Tatar, with frequent inclusion of individual Bashkir and Kazakh words and phrases, idiomatic expressions and comparisons, traditional images from Bashkir and Kazakh folklore. Akmulla preached enlightening ideas, considered poetry as a means of direct communication with the people. Akmulla wrote his poems for the most part in the classical form rubyi, but he also used other poetic forms. Miftahetdin’s work was permeated by the humanistic ideas of that time, and included advanced trends in the social life of Russia. In his work, he preached enlightening ideas, affirmed the human desire for progress. He deserved recognition among the population, and also had a strong influence on the development of literature on the development of literature of many Turkic- speaking peoples. His pseudonym Akmulla means \\"bright, righteous teacher.\\" The views, ideals, philosophical ideas of Akmulla were born in the struggle against religious fanaticism and the manifestations of medieval scholasticism, against oppression of the people. He saw the main way to make life easier for the common people in education, in mastering knowledge, in eradicating ignorance. The central place in Akmulla's worldview was occupied by the question of the place of knowledge in the life of society. He adhered to the positions idealism and in understanding the laws of social development, he believed that the social problems can be eliminated through education.Rashit Shakur. Thr great poet-educator and mentor of the bashkir people This is reflected, for example, in the poem \\"Edification.\\" For Akmulla, the central place in the system of his values was occupied by knowledge and upbringing, the inner purity of man, problems of moral and moral order. Akmulla's creativity formed a whole poetic school. His works influenced poetry Gabdulla Tukai, Mazhit Gafuri, Shaehzada Babich, Daut Yulti, Shafik Aminev-Tamyani, Sayfi Kudash and others. Miftahetdin Akmulla is widely known not only in Bashkortostan and the Russian Federation, but also in the countries of the former USSR. In 1892, the elegy “In Memory of Şihabetdin Märcani” was published in Kazan. This small book was the first and last lifetime edition of the poet's works. Not all of Akumulla’s creative heritage has been preserved. In 1981, in connection with the anniversary of the poet, the Bashkir Book Publishing House published in Bashkir the one-volume works. This book, which is the most complete in comparison with previous collections of Akmullah, includes more than three thousand lines. However, many of the poet’s works are either not yet found, or possibly completely lost. The reason for this was that Akmulla kept most of his works in memory. Poems of the poet were distributed orally or in manuscript. Who is enlightened and trained in craft, He is glorious, proud, not boring in communication, The source of wisdom is available to him, A ignoramus is inseparable with humiliation.

One is that a coachman used to carry his tools, including a hammer, with him underneath his seat to perform repairs to a carriage should it break down on the road. Another is that the \\"hammer\\" portion is a corruption of the word \\"hamper\\", and meant to suggest that the cloth covered a hamper which might contain food for the passengers or coachman.

This cultivar is extensively grown in New Mexico where it was developed and is popular in New Mexican cuisine. Sandia peppers picked while still green are typically roasted to produce green chili. When ripened, this variety can be dried and ground to make chili powder. Sandia peppers grown and consumed in New Mexico are most commonly used to make red or green posole, green chili stew, and carne adovada. History The Sandia pepper cultivar was developed at New Mexico State University by Dr. Roy Harper in 1956 by cross breeding a Numex No. 9 type (originally developed by Dr. Fabian Garcia) with a Californian Anaheim-type chile. This variety of chili pepper is of moderate heat and is widely grown and consumed in New Mexico. Sandia peppers are consumed both as green chili as well as ripe red chilies, and are also dried into ristras. They are considered high yielding with relatively large fruits. In common with most New Mexico chili cultivars, Sandia peppers are somewhat variable in their fruiting and produce individual peppers of varying heat, with most of the peppers being mild (5,000 SHU), and an occasional extremely hot pepper (30,000 SHU). Removing the seeds from the peppers before cooking or consuming them significantly reduces the heat of this variety of pepper.

Beethoven composed it as part of a collection of lieder on texts by Gelllert, which was published in 1803, known as Gellert Lieder. \\"Die Himmel rühmen des Ewigen Ehre\\" became famous in arrangements for choir, \\"'Die Himmel rühmen!\\" by Joseph Dantonello and \\"The Heavens are Telling\\" by Virgil Thomson.  History  Beethoven wrote the lied for voice and piano as the fourth of a collection of six lieder on texts by Gellert. Gellert's poem in six stanzas, \\"\\", appeared first in his 1757 collection Geistliche Oden und Lieder (Spiritual odes and songs). It is a paraphrase of Psalm 19 (\\"The heavens declare the glory of God\\"). Like the psalm, the poem speaks of the Creator's magnificence showing in the wonders of nature, which suited natural theology, popular during Gellert's lifetime. The poem was set to music for voice and continuo in Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's Gellert Odes and Songs. in 1758, among several others. Beethoven set the first two stanzas of the poem. It was published as No. 4 in a collection of six lieder by Beethoven on texts by Gellert in 1803. In the collection, it bears the same title as the poem and begins \\"\\". Beethoven's setting was arranged for four- part choir, organ and orchestra by and became one of the most popular spiritual songs. It was arranged for organ and choir as \\"The Heavens are Telling\\" in 1925 by Virgil Thomson while he was a student at Harvard University, and became popular in the United States. Thomas Doss wrote a transcription for wind band with optional choir. An English version, \\"The heavens are telling the Lord's endless glory\\", with Beethoven's melody has appeared in four hymnals.  Song collection  In the collection Op. 48, Beethoven set six texts by Gellert, all with religious themes, entitled: # Bitten # Die Liebe des Nächsten (Of the love of one's neighbour) # Vom Tode (Of death) # Die Ehre Gottes aus der Natur (The glory of God from nature) # Gottes Macht und Vorsehung (God's power and providence # Bußlied (Penitential song) Five songs are marked in German, while only the last one has a conventional Italian marking. The first song begins \\"Gott, deine Güte reicht so weit\\" (God, your mercy reaches far), alluding to Psalm 108:4. It is marked Feierlich und mit Andacht (Solemnly and with devotion). The second song, \\"So jemand spricht: Ich liebe Gott!\\" (If someone says: I love God), is marked Lebhaft doch nicht zu sehr (Lively but not too much). The third song, \\"Meine Lebenszeit verstreicht\\" (My life time is passing by) is marked Mässig und eher langsam als geschwind (Moderately and rather slow than fast). The fifth song claims \\"Gott ist mein Lied!\\" (God is my song), marked Mit Kraft und Feuer (With strength and fire). The final penitential song begins \\"An dir allein, an dir hab ich gesündigt\\" (Against you alone, against you have I sinned) and is marked Poco adagio (Somewhat slow). Beethoven dedicated the collection to Count Johann Georg von Browne.  Die Himmel rühmen  = Text = Gellert's text is close to the beginning of Psalm 19 in the first two stanzas, which are the only ones that Beethoven used. = Music = Beethoven ignored the two stanzas of the poem, structuring the text differently as a ternary form, ABA. He used the first two lines for a solemn A section; the following four (two from the first stanza and two from the second) for a softer, narrating middle section, beginning with \\"Ihn rühmt der Erdkreis\\" (The circle of the world praises Him); and the final two lines for a slightly modified repeat of the beginning, with the text \\"Sie kommt und leuchtet\\" (It comes and illuminates), the second half of the second stanza. The music in C major and alla breve time is marked \\"Majestätisch und erhaben\\" (Majestic and sublime). The music opens with two measures of solemn chords by the piano. The motif of a downward broken major triad is also found in other compositions by Beethoven dealing with solemn topics, such as the Dona nobis pacem from his Missa solemnis.  Die Himmel rühmen!  Beethoven's song and its adaptations became part of music collections, concerts and recordings, with Die Himmel rühmen! sometimes chosen as the title. The German pop singer Heino chose the song as the title and motto of four church concert series in Germany.  References  Cited sources       External links   C. F.

Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press on behalf of the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals The purchase was made in August: in the previous month Bendyshe had voted in for the Liberal John Stuart Mill, leading (this was an open ballot) to his expulsion from the Conservative Club. Mill had attended the March 1865 meeting called to decide what to do with the failing paper. According to James, there was as well Bendyshe's failed The Reflector. He had trouble getting the printers to accept his copy. He also offended in a review Robert Gordon Latham, author of The Natural History of Varieties of Men, associated with the Ethnological Society. Over Christmas 1868, A. C. Swinburne stayed at King's College as Bendyshe's guest. According to Edmund Gosse, who calls Bendyshe a \\"fantastic character\\" in his essay \\"A Poet among the Cannibals\\", they had been introduced by Richard Burton at The Cannibal Club. They studied together the French translation of the Mahabharata by Hippolyte Fauche. Works Bendyshe's major work, from 1865, was The Anthropological Treatises of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach for the Anthropological Society. It was an edition in translation of Latin works by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach. Included also, in translation, were: a biographical memoir by Karl Friedrich Heinrich Marx; another memoir, by Jean Pierre Flourens; an account of the \\"Blumenbachian Museum\\", by Rudolf Wagner; and a dissertation from 1775 by John Hunter M.D. on the \\"varieties of man\\". Blumenbach's 1775 doctoral dissertation De varietatis humani varietate nativa is accompanied by its third edition from 1795, both as translated by Bendyshe. The dissertation by Hunter actually takes a different line from Blumenbach's later views, Hunter on the matter of human diversity being \\"staunchly monogenist and environmentalist\\".Aris Sarafianos, The Natural History of Man and the Politics of Medical Portraiture in Manchester, The Art Bulletin Vol. 88, No. 1 (Mar. 2006), pp. 102–118, at p. 118 note 55. Published by: CAA Blumenbach, noted for his theory of racial classification, began with the rejection of polygenist and chain of being views of race, regarding environmental forces as key; but later cited a nisus formativus (:de:Bildungstrieb) tracing back to Immanuel Kant's vitalism of 1773. Bendyshe disagreed with the interpretation of Flourens, that Blumenbach was a monogenist, calling that view a \\"singular mistake\\" in terms of the \\"unity of the human genus\\". The English translations from Blumenbach were not the first, and their value has been put in question, with Michael asserting that uncritical use of Bendyshe's edition has led to incorrect conclusions detrimental to Blumenbach's reputation. Michael argues that two translators worked on them, and one of those introduced some systematic errors in the language used in the English version. In particular he states that an article by Stephen Jay Gould, proposing that Blumenbach's work on race was undermined by aesthetic views, is flawed in ways including the use made of Bendyshe's edition. In the Memoirs of the Anthropological Society, Bendyshe wrote in 1863, the year of the Society's foundation, \\"The History of Anthropology\\". For the Memoirs he also translated the 1721 dissertation Dissertatio critica de hominibus orbis nostri incolis specie et ortu by Vincentius Rumpf (which has been incorrectly attributed to Johann Albert Fabricius). It argued for the inheritance of acquired characters, in connection with climatic variation of race.Conway Zirkle, The Early History of the Idea of the Inheritance of Acquired Characters and of Pangenesis, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society Vol. 35, No. 2 (Jan. 1946), pp. 91–151, at p. 105. Published by: American Philosophical Society Views Bendyshe wrote in 1864 in the Society's Anthrological Review an article \\"On the Extinction of Races\\". His view on the Aboriginal Australians was that their population decline was caused by \\"promiscuous intercourse, artificial abortion, infanticide, wars, diseases, and poverty\\". James Hunt of the Society concurred. Lorimer considers this an example of the joint use of racist and Malthusian arguments. According to Adrian Desmond, Bendyshe, Hunt and James McGrigor Allan were major proponents of the views of the polygenist Carl Vogt. Bendyshe was impressed by the diversity of African skulls, but did not conclude that the Africans were a different species of human, making his attitude more nuanced than some others. He dissented at length from Hunt's negative position stated in 1864 as an address \\"On the Negro's Place in Nature\\" on civilisation.James Hunt, On the Negro's Place in Nature, Journal of the Anthropological Society of London Vol. 2 (1864), pp. xv–lvi from p. xxxiv.

After the defeat of the Girondists, he was imprisoned but soon released and allowed to return home. There, he found himself persecuted and detained by Jacob von Sievers, a deputy of Empress Catherine the Great. In 1794, he joined the Kościuszko Uprising; becoming a member of the Provisional Council of the Duchy of Masovia and the Supreme National Council. When the uprising collapsed, he was taken into house arrest in Saint Petersburg. He was released following an amnesty in 1795 and, in 1797, he once again went to Paris. He remained there until 1802, then established himself at what is now known as the Mostowski Palace, which he had inherited in 1795. He also resumed his publishing enterprise, with the latest equipment brought in from Paris. He was in France again for much of 1812. Later that year, he became the Minister of the Interior for the Duchy of Warsaw. From 1815 to 1830, he served as the presiding minister for the Government Commission for Internal Affairs of Congress Poland. While in that position, he helped promote construction of the Augustów Canal and established the (Agronomic Institute) in Marymont.

When the uprising had been quashed, the Russian authorities allowed him to emigrate to France, where he owned lands inherited from his father. He died there ten years later, and was interred at Montmartre Cemetery. His first wife was the writer, Anna Olimpia Przeździecka, whom he married in 1787 and divorced in 1804. He was her second husband and they had no children. His second marriage, to Marianną Potocką (1780-1837), a member of the noble Potocki family, produced five children.

A 2.04-metre ruckman who can also play as a key forward, he played in several state leagues before being drafted by Geelong as a mature-age recruit. He made his AFL debut in round 9 of the 2019 season.  Junior and state-league career  From Geelong, Victoria, Fort originally played for South Barwon as a junior and represented the Geelong Falcons in the TAC Cup. Ahead of the 2012 AFL draft he was little-noticed by recruiters until a match with South Barwon in the Geelong Football League, when he rucked competitively against Brad Ottens, a triple-premiership player for Geelong, despite his size and experience deficit. Over his 10 TAC Cup matches for the season, Fort averaged 10 disposals, 3.5 marks, 26 hitouts and 3.4 tackles; the Herald Sun reported that he was regarded as among the best ruckmen in the competition, highlighted Fort's tackling, tenacity and follow- up effort as strengths, and predicted he would be drafted in the late second or early third round (pick 40-50). Fort was nevertheless overlooked at the 2012 draft (a snub the Geelong Advertiser called \\"inexplicable\\") and entered a stint in the Victorian Football League (VFL) with Werribee. He played four matches of the 2013 season before moving to Footscray. Fort played eleven matches and kicked eight goals over the next two years, then switched to South Australian National Football League club Central District ahead of the 2016 season. At this point, he was playing as a ruckman with stints as a key defender. Over the next three years, Fort kicked 29 goals in 52 games as he began to take on a forward-line role. Fox Sports claimed he \\"might be the best mature-age ruck prospect in Australia\\" after he averaged 31.5 hitouts for Central District in 2018; journalist Callum Twomey also highlighted Fort as a possible selection in the 2018 AFL draft.  AFL career  Fort (centre) is hugged by teammates Gary Rohan, Tom Hawkins and Gryan Miers after kicking his first AFL goal. Fort was drafted by Geelong with pick 65 in the 2018 national draft, quitting his job as a civil engineer to play for the club. He followed Orren Stephenson (2011) and Ryan Abbott (2016) as mature-age ruckmen selected by the club. Fort began his time with Geelong competing with Abbott, Rhys Stanley and Zac Smith for the ruckman position. The proliferation of ruckmen led to him spending more time as a key forward in Geelong's VFL reserves, where he kicked eight goals in four matches and displayed strong marking ability while rucking alongside Abbott. After Stanley withdrew late from Geelong's round 9 match against the , Fort replaced him for his first AFL match. He notched 17 hitouts and kicked three goals in combination with Abbott. He played two more matches to complete the 2019 season.

He is considered a specialist in hematopoiesis.  Biography  William Vainchenker is Director of Research at Inserm, Hematopoiesis and Stem Cells Unit, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif. William Vainchenker is best known for his discoveries in the field of malignant blood diseases and the genetic mechanisms responsible for predisposition to myeloproliferative syndromes and leukaemias. William Vainchenker studied medicine from 1966-1971 in Paris VII University and passed his medical thesis in 1977. At the same time he completed his bachelor's degree in science, then a DEA (master 2) and a postgraduate thesis in science in 1978 in Paris VI University. He was appointed to the Paris Hospital Boarding School in 1971 and did his hospital internships from 1971 to 1978 with an interruption as a technical assistance cooperator. William Vainchenker then worked as an intern at the Inserm unit headed by Professor Jean Rosa at Henri Mondor Hospital (Créteil) in the team of Mrs Jeanine Breton Gorius where he started working on megacaryocyte differentiation. In 1981 he returned to a university hospital activity in hemato-immunology as head of the clinic in the department of Professor Maxime Seligmann. In 1983 William Vainchenker was recruited as research director at Inserm in Professor Jean Rosa's unit. In 1993, he took over the management of an Inserm unit at the Gustave Roussy Institute on the theme of experimental haematology, which he managed until 2010. William Vainchenker then remained until now as a researcher in the same Inserm unit at Gustave Roussy. Until now, he has kept a hematology consultation at Saint Louis Hospital.  Scientific contributions  William Vainchenker has always worked on megacaryocyte differentiation with the objective of characterizing the mechanisms that regulate this normal that leads to platelet formation and then transposing these data to human pathology. This allowed him to be the first team to identify and characterize the progenitor of the megacaryocyte line,Vainchenker W, Bouguet J, Guichard J, Breton-Gorius J., « Megakaryocyte colony formation from human bone marrow precursors », Blood, 1979 oct;54(4), p. 940-5 then to define its different steps and apply these data to the characterization of leukaemias.

The hospital originally did not have an ambulance system and relied on \\"funeral homes' ambulance services to get patients to emergency care\\". Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare was ranked 91 of the top 100 best companies to work for in 2018. The healthcare system has been criticized for its pursuit of payment from poor patients. In July 2007, Carrie Barrett went to the emergency room at Methodist University Hospital complaining about shortness of breath, swelling of legs and black discoloration of her toes.

An English translation of his work on eggshells was published by Cyril Tyler in 1964.  Life  Wilhelm was the sixth of eight children of the industrialist Johann Gottlob Nathusius and Luise née Engelhard (1787–1875). A maternal great grandfather was the historian Johann Christoph Gatterer. Wilhelm's brothers included Hermann von Nathusius and Heinrich von Nathusius. = Childhood and adolescence = Nathusius was born in the Hundisburg castle but grew up in the neighboring estate of Althaldensleben where he received private tuition from Julius Carl Elster (1803-1881). His interest in science was kindled by his brother Hermann. = Training = From the age of 14, he was introduced to his father's earthenware industries where he was given administrative tasks. He was trained by the porcelain expert Alexandre Brongniart. Nathusius studied chemistry in Paris from 1838 under Jean-Baptiste Dumas. After some time in military service in 1840 he began to study in Berlin. He then decided to work in agriculture as porcelain did not appear viable. = Königsborn = The castle at Königsborn near Magdeburg was bought by Wilhelm's father in 1834 and taken over by Wilhelm after the death of his father in 1843. Wilhelm married Marie Johanne von Meibom in Magdeburg on 6 June 1844. The couple lived in the castle and had six children. Numerous guests visited and stayed with them including the poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, a friend of Wilhelm who met Marie's friend Elvira Detroit. The couple were known for their piety and charity, and established a school, an orphan home and a shelter for the old. = Farmer and breeder = Nathusius' estate included about 500 hectares of land. He conducted experiments on different varieties of crops and tested out new farm machinery. He also bred horses and conducted studies on the diseases of livestock. = Oologist = Nathusius's most influential study was on the shells of bird eggs. He was a collector of bird eggs and published several notes in ornithology journals. His chemical analysis of eggshells, experiments with polarized light and speculations on the structure of eggs were pioneering and bold for his time. His egg collections were donated to the museum in Berlin. He collaborated with the Halle paleontologist Christoph Gottfried Giebel. He compared the shells of molluscs, crustaceans, and those of eggs but he refused to accept the idea of biological evolution and was an avowed \\"Anti-Darwinist\\". = Public offices = Nathusius was influential in agriculture and was a member of various government bodies. He was a member of the Royal Prussian State Economics College from 1852 until 1878. He was a founding member of the German Agricultural Society. For his achievements he was raised to the Prussian nobility on October 18, 1861.

He has been a member of both the French Academy of Sciences and the French Academy of Medicine since 18 November 2003.  Biography  Vincent was born in Libourne, located in the Gironde department of Bordeaux. He is the only son of a Freemason wine broker. He studied in Sainte-Foy-la-Grande (Gironde) at a Protestant college whose master intended him to study literature at the École normale supérieure, then at the Lycée Michel-Montaigne in Bordeaux.Chercher - Jours après jours, les aventuriers du savoir, éditions Autrement, 2000, , . His parents, wine brokers and Protestants, encouraged him to undertake medical studies at the École du Service de Santé des Armées de Bordeaux.Entretien avec Jean-Didier Vincent dans Le Tête-à-tête de Frédéric Taddeï sur France Culture le 22 janvier 2012. He majored in physics, chemistry and biology. As an intern in clinical services, he met the neuropsychiatrist Jacques Faure, who encouraged him to do research in this field.Interview de Jean Didier Vincent par Jacques Paugam sur Canal Académie, 27 février 2011 Vincent was a hospital biologist in physiology and functional explorations at the CHRU of Bordeaux (1966-1977), Professor without a chair (1973-1978) and professor of physiology at the Bordeaux Faculty of Medicine (1979-1992).

He has carried out research in neurobiology in the United States (postdoctoral fellowship at the Brain Institute of the University of California, Los Angeles) and then in France (CNRS, Inserm). Jean-Didier Vincent has been President of the National Council of Programmes at the Ministry of National Education since 2002, member of the CNRS Ethics of Science Committee (COMETS) and the INRA (Institut National de Recherché en Agronomie) Ethics and Precaution Committee for Agricultural Research Applications (COMEPRA). A member of the Executive Board of the Foundation for Political Innovation until 23 January 2009, he has been President of the Association pour l'Université Numérique Francophone Mondiale (UNFM) since October 2005.  Scientific contributions  Vincent has contributed significantly to the development of neuroendocrinology, which includes the study of interactions between hormones and the nervous system, the brain being also considered as an endocrine gland. He has a more pessimistic vision than his colleague Boris Cyrulnik about what predetermines human behaviour and believes in the primacy of the biological over reason, stating in 2013 in the film La Possibilité d'être humain : \\"L'homme est libre, oui, mais en liberté surveillée\\". He has published numerous books on theory of biology, for example Biologie des passions, La Chair et le diable.Sébastien Lemerle, « Les habits neufs du biologisme en France », Actes de la recherche en sciences sociale, nos 176-177, 2009, p. 75 In his book he defends a dynamic above all sexual dynamics of love (Eros). He lists the sexual practices that are omnipresent in nature and suggests that the notion of women's property was born during the sedentarization of the Neolithic era. It also details the complexity of sexual systems, which are often designed to frame the reproductive rules of each species. In his book Bienvenue en Transhumanie, he takes a sceptical look at transhumanism, denouncing a lack of morality that is necessary around this radical transformation of the genome. He fears a disconnection between reproduction and sexuality, and that sexuality is virtualized by directly stimulating the affected parts of the brain.

Her murder was instigated by her mother-in-law, 70-year-old Bachan Kaur Athwal, in collusion with Surjit's husband, Sukhdave Singh Athwal. Surjit had found a new partner and started divorce proceedings against her abusive husband. A divorce would bring shame onto the Athwals, so Bachan Kaur lured Surjit to India, leading her to believe that if she attended two weddings in Punjab, the family would consent to a divorce. Instead, she was killed there and her body has never been found. This case marked the first conviction, in a British court, of an honour killing committed outside of the UK. Background Surjit was born in Coventry, England, in 1971 and grew up in the Foleshill suburb of the city. In 1988, at age 16, she married Sukhdave Singh Athwal in a forced marriage. He was ten years older than Surjit and they'd met only once before they were married and she moved in with his family. Both Sukhdave and Surjit's family are Sikhs, of Punjabi origin. Bachan Kaur Athwal was the matriarch of the family, she was described as \\"controlling\\" by her daughter-in-law and said to treat Surjit like a slave. Keen for some independence, Surjit found work as a customs agent with HM Customs and Excise at London Heathrow Airport; she began to dress in western-style clothing, wore make-up and socialised with her colleagues. Both Bachan Kaur and Sukhdave beat and abused her to try and get her to conform to their standards and Sukhdave started spying on her while she was out with her workmates, eventually spotting her with another man. She'd formed a relationship with someone she'd met at work and was having an affair, when this was discovered she sought a divorce. At the time of her disappearance, Surjit and Sukhdave resided in Hayes, London Borough of Hillingdon; they lived next door to Sukhdave's mother, his brother Hardave Athwal and sister-in-law Sarbjit Athwal and had two children. Crime In December 1998, a meeting was held at the home of Bacham Kaur Athwal, in attendance were her daughter, Bhajam Kaur Bhinder, her two sons and her daughter-in-law, Sarbjit. It is claimed that Bacham Kaur told the other attendees that she intended to \\"get rid of\\" Surjit and would be taking her to India, where plans had already been made to achieve this aim. Meanwhile, after initially refusing to agree to a divorce, Bachan Kaur told Surjit that a divorce could go ahead if she accompanied her to two weddings in India; the pair flew to Delhi on 4 December 1998. They were met at the airport by Bacham Kaur's brother, Darshan Singh, and on 5 and 6 December attended two weddings in rural Punjab. After the weddings Surjit went to a travel agent to try and secure an earlier flight home but was unable to do so, and she didn't return on 18 December as originally scheduled. When Surjit failed to return and questions were asked about her whereabouts, Bachan Kaur and Sukhdave wove a web of deceit to cover up her disappearance; they claimed that she'd run away with another man in India and Sukhdave claimed to have spoken to her on the phone to confirm that she wasn't coming back, yet he told someone else she'd \\"passed away\\"; they forged letters purporting to be from the Metropolitan Police which they sent to the Indian Police to put them off investigating, and they forged conveyancing documents so they could transfer Surjit's financial share of the family home to themselves. It also transpired that Sukdave had taken out a life insurance policy on Surjit the day she flew to India, he then petitioned for a divorce, claiming desertion. In reality, Bachan and Sukhdave had conspired to have Surjit murdered in India. She was taken by two men - one of whom was, allegedly, the brother of Bachan Kaur - she was drugged and strangled, her body deposited in the Ravi River and never recovered. Investigation The day after Surjit flew to Delhi her sister-in-law, Sarbjit Athwal, claims to have contacted Crimestoppers UK, leaving an answerphone message about her concerns for Surjit's safety but didn't receive a response. When Surjit failed to return to the UK on 18 December, she sent an anonymous letter to the local police station repeating her concerns. In May 2000, Bachan Kaur, Sukhdave Athwal and two other family members were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder but were released without charge. The evidence was deemed purely circumstantial. Sarbjit described the years following Surjit's disappearance as living \\"in a constant climate of fear\\", she was effectively coerced and threatened into silence. It wasn't until 2004, when she was taken into hospital with a life-threatening, stress-related condition, that she decided to try and free herself from the Athwal family. When she left hospital she went back to her parents home, where she told her father everything that had happened and he eventually managed to persuade her to go back to the police and make a statement. Sarbjit and her family were subjected to death threats, intimidation and were shunned within the locak Sikh community as a result. In 2005, after Sarbjit had given a police statement, British authorities re-opened the murder case. Sarbjit's statement referenced the family meeting at which the plot to \\"get rid of\\" Surjit was discussed and it also alleged that Bachan Kaur had explicitly told her that Surjit had been killed in India and thrown in the river. On 3 November 2005, one of Bachan Kaur's daughters' was arrested and quizzed about the family meeting of December 1998; she denied being at the meeting, but she did acknowledge that her mother had told her that Surjit had been killed. She later backtracked and claimed not to remember anything about such a conversation, but was compelled to testify as a hostile witness at the trial. Metropolitan Police officers, led by DCI Clive Driscoll, travelled to India to gather evidence and interview suspects and, after a complex investigation, Bachan Kaur and Sukhdave Athwal were charged with conspiracy to murder in November 2005 and with murder in August 2006. =Legal Proceedings= Bachan Kaur Athwal and Sukhdave Athwal stood trial at the Old Bailey in Spring 2007, the trial lasted for three months. Sarbjit spent three-and-a-half days giving evidence and being cross-examined; she was the first person to testify against their own family members in an open court, in a British honour killing trial. Both Bachan Kaur and Sukhda Athwal were found guilty of murder; Bachan Kaur was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 20 years; Karen McVeigh of The Guardian stated that Bachan was \\"one of the oldest women in criminal history to be jailed for life\\"; she was aged 70 at the time of sentencing. Sukhdave received a life sentence with a minimum term of 27 years. In March 2009, Bachan Kaur appealed against both her conviction and sentence. Her appeal against conviction was dismissed, but her minimum tariff was reduced to 15 years. It was deemed that the original sentence was \\"manifestly excessive\\" due to her advanced age and the \\"grave cultural difficulties (Bachan) will encounter\\" in jail. Sukdave appealed against his sentence but not his conviction, the minimum tarriff was duly reduced to 20 years. =Aftermath= Surjit's children were taken into the care of Social Services when their father was arrested. In January 2008, a confiscation order was issued to recoup proceeds obtained by Bachan Kaur and Sukhdave Athwal when they fraudulently transferred ownership of Surjit's previous home to themselves. Sukdave had forged Surjit's signature on the documentation in 2004 and the house was sold in 2007, the money was deposited into Bachan Kaur's account and then quickly transferred out into the bank accounts of various family members. After being forced to return what would've been Surjit's portion of the proceeds, it was awarded to her two children via a compensation order. Surjit's brother, Jagdeesh, who campaigned relentlessly for action after his sister's disappearance, continued to pursue his quest to have those directly responsible for Surjit's murder prosecuted; in 2013, he wrote to British Prime Minister, David Cameron, asking that he \\"press the Indian Prime Minister\\" to have the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of India reinvestigate the case. In response, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated: \\"We cannot interfere in another country's legal procedures, just as they cannot interfere in ours\\". Surjit's killers remain free. Donal MacIntyre, a journalist covering the criminal sphere, made a documentary about the case. (CBS Reality: Murder Files. Series 1, Episode 7) Really (TV channel) crime series, \\"The Killer in My Family\\" (Season 1, Episode 5 - Bachan Kaur Athwal) also covered the case.

Elastic comes in four forms forms of construction, each with costs and benefits. The component which performs the actual stretching is made of either rubber or a synthetic material such as spandex; this stretching component is then covered with polyester, cotton, nylon, or a combination of these or other fibers which allow it to be attached to clothing. High-quality elastic is able to be stretched to twice its original length and then return to its unflexed state without showing appreciable wear. Purpose Elastics may be either braided, knitted, woven, or transparent. Braided elastic, the most common form of elastic, becomes more narrow as it stretches. Stitching or piercing this kind of elastic causes it to quickly lose its ability to return to its original shape (a ball-point sewing needle will minimize this damage). It has distinct parallel ribs along its surface, and is used for hems, swimwear, and leg bands. Knitted elastic is considered soft, lightweight, and quite strong. It does not narrow when stretched, and piercing it with a needle does not affect its ability to return to its original shape. It is considered practical for lightweight fabrics. Woven elastic is very strong, and is thicker than other forms of elastic. It is used for items such as upholstery and car covers. It has both crosswise and lengthwise ribs, making it resemble a window pane. It does not narrow when stretched nor is it affected by being pierced. Transparent elastic is actually transparent polyurethane and it is not braided, knitted, or woven. It can stretch to three or four times its original length with complete recovery to its former shape. Because rubber is made of latex, some elastics are now made without rubber, particularly those used in the medical fields. The most common elastics, however, are made from latex-based rubber and polyester fibers— these forms tend to hold up well to being worn and washed regularly. Elastics made with nylon tend to have a soft luster to them, and are used for lingerie and some swimwear. They do not tolerate high heat, and should not be exposed to high temperatures inside a dryer. Other elastics are made with cotton, which tends to shrink slightly after being worn and washed but is very versatile and is an all-natural alternative to man-made fibers.

Albanian faith in Serbian) was a 14th century Serbian antonomasic denunciation of Catholic Albanians in Shkodër, Zeta, Kosovo, Macedonia and other regions modern day Northern Albania. In the Dušan's Code, the Albanians were mentioned as \\"latin believers\\", \\"heretic latins\\" or \\"non- believers\\". The term was first used by Pjetër Bogdani in 1685 in his Cvnevs Prophetarum when he mentioned the \\"shkietë\\" (Slavs) using the term to describe the Albanian faith. The term helped create a necessary differentiation of Christian Albanian culture through out the centuries. Other similar ethnonyms for the Albanians were \\"Arbanaš\\", \\"arbanaški\\", \\"jezik\\" or \\"latins\\" as it is mentioned in the year 1300 in the village of Shën Gjergj to Skopje. Serbian historian Dimitrije Bogdanović writes that Andrea Bogdani, nephew of Pjeter, wrote in 1662 a report to the Propagation of the Faith mentioning that the core of the Catholics in Serbia are the Albanians and that the Catholic faith in Serbia is called \\"Arbanaska vera\\". Albanian archeologist and historian Edi Shukriu writes that the existence of the denunciation proves that the Albanians at the time were subjects of an ethnocultural assimilation policy initiated by the Serbian medieval state. In 1927, Midhat Frashëri published an article in the Albanian paper Dituria where he writes that the Serbian medieval despots used to denounce the Catholic faith as \\"Arbanaska vera\\". In Latin, the term was \\"La fede albanese\\". Lutfi Aliu writes that the term may also be another word for the Albanian besa.

Leung ran as an independent localist in the 2019 District Council elections and won his seat with 50.69% of the vote. Career Leung developed an interest in politics at high school, and took part in Hong Kong's 2014 Umbrella Movement as a teenager. He studied biomedicine at the University of Hong Kong, where he served as the external affairs secretary of the student union. In July 2019, Leung was spurred by the ongoing Hong Kong protests to run for a position on his local District Council. As a first-time candidate competing against the incumbent Yeung Hoi-wing, Leung won the seat in Kwun Lung, which had been considered a pro-establishment stronghold, represented by the same political party since 2007. His election win was amid record voter turnout throughout the city, which Leung described as \\"a milestone in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement\\". In June 2020, Leung announced his intention to run in the 2020 Hong Kong legislative election. He connected with fellow localist candidates Sam Cheung and Owen Chow, where they signed a joint statement agreeing to promote the protest movement's demands if elected. In the pro-democracy primaries for the Hong Kong Island constituency, Leung took third place with 14,743 votes, after Ted Hui and Tiffany Yuen, securing him a nomination spot in the general election. On 30 July, weeks before the general election, the government stated that Leung was among a dozen pro-democracy candidates whose nominations were 'invalid'. His disqualification was determined by an opaque process where returning officers nominally assessed whether Leung had objected to the enactment of the national security law, and was sincere in statements made disavowing separatism.

The game was written and directed by Kazutaka Kodaka, better known as the creator of the Danganronpa series. Synopsis Death Come True is an interactive film adventure game in which the player is tasked with finding clues and uncovering the truth of the protagonist's actions. The player has the ability to \\"time leap\\" with Karaki, who can be sent to the past. Story The game's plot follows Makoto Karaki (Kanata Hongō) as he wakes up in a strange hotel room after having lost all of his memories. When turning on the television, he finds out that he is a serial killer. As Karaki investigates the hotel, he finds it impossible to leave as all of the exits are sealed. He also meets two police investigators, Akane Sachimura (Chiaki Kuriyama) and Nozomu Kuji (Win Morisaki) who are investigating him on the suspicion that he is a serial killer wanted for strangling numerous women. However, Karaki finds himself inexplicably drawn to Sachimura. After dying several times in the course of his investigations, Karaki eventually begins to recover some of his memories and confronts the hotel Concierge (Yuki Kaji), questioning if the hotel is even real. The Concierge reveals that the hotel is actually a virtual reality space created by the \\"Come True\\" system, which is capable of recreating memories from living or deceased individuals that others can view through virtual reality reconstruction. While intended for the treatment of mental illnesses, the Come True is secretly being used for police investigations. Karaki himself is actually another Investigator who connected the real Karaki and Sachimura, both deceased in the real world, to find the truth behind Sachimura's death. The Concierge then warns the Investigator that an unknown party is hacking Come True in an attempt to delete the hotel, which also caused the Investigator to lose his memories and mistakenly believe himself to be Karaki. The Concierge suggests that the Investigator escape the hotel, which he always had the choice to do whenever he dies. However, the Investigator continues his search for the truth. With more of his memories coming back, he and Sachimura confront Kuji, suspecting him to be Sachimura's real killer. Sachimura suspected Kuji of corruption, so he made a deal with Karaki to murder her in return for passage out of the country, but Kuji betrayed him and killed him instead. The hacker, the real Kuji, then appears and admits that he is indeed guilty. However, he gives the Investigator a proposition. Rather than return to the real world and reveal Kuji's crimes, he can instead stay in the virtual world with Sachimura forever. If the Investigator chooses to stay in the virtual world, Kuji escapes, though he warns the pair not to leave the hotel since the virtual world outside is unknown. The Investigator and Sachimura decide to leave the hotel, and live happily together in an unstable virtual world created from Sachimura's memories. If the Investigator chooses to leave the virtual world, he follows clues left behind by Sachimura to find the evidence she gathered proving Kuji's corruption. As a result, Kuji is arrested and investigated for his involvement in Sachimura's murder and the killings performed by Karaki. Development and release Death Come True was developed by Too Kyo Games and Esquadra and published by IzanagiGames, written and directed by Kazutaka Kodaka with music by Masafumi Takada. Esquadra was responsible for the primary development work. It was released for Android, iOS, and Nintendo Switch on June 24 in Japan, June 25 in North America, June 26 in Europe, and June 27, 2020 in Australia.

This kind of therapy is especially applied during couple therapy. Carl Whitaker and Virginia Satir are credited as the founders of co-therapy. Co-therapy dates back to the early twentieth century in Vienna, where psychoanalytic practices were first taking place. It was originally named \\"multiple therapy\\" by Alfred Alder, and later introduced separately as \\"co-therapy\\" in the 1940s. Co-therapy began with two therapists of differing abilities, one essentially learning from the other, and providing the opportunity to hear feedback on their work.  Advantages of co-therapy  = An active support system = Co-therapy has recently been discussed more thoroughly, and its advantageous aspects have been analysed. Researchers, namely Bowers & Gauron, suggest that co-therapy provides each therapist with a \\"support system\\" in their partner. This allows for appropriate communication and the ability to lean on each other when \\"in the face of the power of the group\\". Bowers & Gauron are supported by other researchers in this aspect of co-therapy. Russell and Russell also suggest that both therapists are sources of support for each other. This can be in the case of clients (either singular, couples, or families) who express delusional systems or aspects of psychopathy that may be difficult to deal with alone. A co-therapeutic design is more beneficial in these situations as therapists act objectively in each others' aid. This situation highlights an additional advantage of the amount of emotional draining experienced by each therapist individually. Support of both therapists is carried through - if one is absent, there will always be someone available to collect information and continue with the sessions. = An educational model = Additionally, researchers suggest that a co-therapy relationship is beneficial as an educational model. Cividini and Klain proposed three models of co-therapy education. These three designs all incorporated differing levels of skill in each therapist, for example: situation one, having one experienced and one inexperienced therapist; situation two, including two inexperienced therapists; and situation three, involving two experienced therapists. All models are said to be advantageous, as they all provide educational benefits, such as an inexperienced therapist gaining confidence whilst alongside one with more experience, and in an inexperienced model, the likeliness of a therapist overruling a session is wildly reduced. Moreover, a co-therapist relationship can \\"compensate for individual weaknesses\\", meaning that more rounded conclusions can be drawn from therapy sessions as research has shown that co-therapeutic relationships provide greater insight into a client's analysis. Russell & Russell add to this notion by mentioning that conjoint therapeutic relationships can be valuable within the realm of education in order to \\"role-model didactically\\", suggesting that it is extremely beneficial for a more inexperienced therapist to learn in a conjoint environment. = A respected role model = Although therapists can and have been seen to role-model for each other, they are simultaneously acting as examples of good practice for the clients themselves. Researchers Peck & Schroeder suggested that co-therapists could act as alternative powers where necessary. For example, absent parents. This would benefit clients greatly as they can relate to situations created by therapists and discover healthy ways to react and process. Bowers & Gauron furthered this by mentioning that a healthy relationship between co-therapists can act as an effective role model to patients. This is extremely beneficial in situations such as couples therapy, for example. Therapists must also be actively aware of the notion that they are constantly being watched and act accordingly. Natalie Shainess described this situation as 'do as I tell you, but not as I do', suggesting that clients need to also be aware of the imperfect representation that could occur, signalling that they should copy what is said, rather than what they see.  Disadvantages of co-therapy  Although advantages exist (as above), the disadvantages of co-therapy and the issues that may arise for both clients and therapists have also been explored. Dangers can impact clients, therapists and spouses of therapists alike. Fabrizio Napolitani described co-therapy as not only lacking advantages, but also not being free of hazards. The requirement for therapists is ever- increasing, with some suggesting that using two therapists when not extremely necessary is a waste of resources and adds to the expense of therapy provision. Therapists are less likely to be paired thoughtfully, and are usually randomly placed together. This could increase the likeliness of tension during sessions, and could create unnecessary competition. Alternatively, if the therapists form an amicable relationship, there is also the risk of their attention being diverted from the client, which leads to a negative impact on the session where the treatment of the patient is compromised. = Spouse involvement = A widely debated topic within co- therapy is the involvement of spouses. This could refer to both a spouse of a therapist or a co-therapy relationship that consists of spouses themselves. Many issues can arise as a result of this, for example, jealousy of a third- party relationship. Dickes and Dunn suggested that voyeurism was an intricate part of co-therapy, where therapists gain sexual attraction to their partner as a result of competition in diagnoses. Bowers & Gauron go into more detail on the issue, describing how a therapist and their spouse may disagree about the amount of time one spends with their co-therapist, and how their spouse may become insecure about this as they feel they are not of primary importance. Co-therapists are required to spend a lot of time together outside of therapy sessions to discuss diagnoses and analyses of patients which, although seen in one sense as an advantage, can cause issues in the personal relationships of the therapists themselves.

The title, The Armageddon Network, refers to this group of people and the possible threat they pose to \\"U.S. national security and world peace\\".Saba, M. (1984). The Armageddon Network. Amana Books. Cover Copy. On March 9, 1978, Michael Saba was waiting to meet someone in the coffee shop of the Madison Hotel in Washington D.C.. As he sat reading a newspaper, the three Hebrew-speaking men, later identified as Israeli officials,Saba, M. (1984). The Armageddon Network. Amana Books. pg.261 Stern: United States Justice Department, Criminal Division, Memo. sitting at an adjacent table were joined by a fourth who was introduced as \\"Stephen Bryen of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\\". What he overheard soon led to an FBI investigation, and took Saba \\"down a path of inquiry which would reveal to me the activities of a small group of influential U.S. policy-makers who used their positions to shape American policy - regardless of the economic and strategic costs - so as to favor the military interests of the Israeli Government.\\"Saba, M. (1984). The Armageddon Network. Amana Books. pg.16. The conversation between Stephen Bryen and the Israeli officials covered the following subjects: :* The West Bank: Bryen advised the Israelis that to win U.S. support for annexation of the West Bank they should make the case in terms of national security rather than on biblical grounds. :* U.S. armaments and jet fighters: How to prevent Israel's Arab enemies from acquiring them and how to get more for Israel. Bryen advised the Israelis that some sort of bargain in the National Security Council needed to be struck in order to prevent a proposed sale of F-15s to Egypt and Saudi Arabia. :* Israel's capacity to build their own aircraft. :* Military bases: Bryen offered to show the Israelis \\"the Pentagon document on the bases, which you are welcome to see\\".Saba, M. (1984). The Armageddon Network. Amana Books. Appendix A, Affidavit of Michael P. Saba This remark would put Bryen under suspicion of passing secret documents to a foreign power and became a primary focus of the following FBI investigation. The document concerned was a titled \\"DOD Analysis of Saudi Request to Purchase f-15 Fighter Aircraft\\" and was stamped \\"Secret  NoForn\\"Saba, M. (1984). The Armageddon Network. Amana Books. pg.93 meaning it was secret and not to be shown to foreigners. Among other things, it contained details about the new Saudi Arabian airbase at Tabuk. Bryen eventually admitted to making the offer to the Israelis but claimed he intended only to show them an unclassified summary of the document. On April 1, 1978 the Associated Press broke the story about Stephen Bryen's meeting with the Israeli officials. Five days later the Washington Post mentioned the affair and noted that Bryen was leaving his position at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in order to \\"prepare for his upcoming wedding.\\" Saba is later informed by a reporter that Bryen didn't actually leave his job with the committee until February 9, 1979 when he took a position with the Coalition for a Democratic Majority. Bryen's career up till then had been spent on the Republican side of the aisle. The investigation As the Justice Department investigation into Stephen Bryen continued, Saba took up his own investigation of Stephen Bryen and his colleagues. The Coalition for a Democratic Majority was founded by Senator Henry M. Jackson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and other hawkish Democrats. This coalition was home to many public figures who came to be known as neoconservatives who were basically social liberals who favored a high military budgets and interventionist foreign policies in order to benefit Israel. Bryen's lawyer insisted on many preconditions controlling the subject matter of any questions he would be willing to answer in sworn deposition with the Justice Department. The Justice Department investigators, John Davitt and Joel Lisker, considered these conditions to be too restrictive and, in a memo to their supervisor, Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, Philip Heymann, said \\"we urge strongly\\" completing the inquiry before an investigative grand jury.Saba, M. (1984). The Armageddon Network. Amana Books. pg.104. The memo goes on to state: > Some of the unresolved questions thus far, which suggest that Bryen is (a) > gathering classified information for the Israelis, (b) acting as their > unregistered foreign agent and (c) lying about it, are as follows: > [Following five-and-one-half pages blacked out]Saba, M. (1984). The > Armageddon Network. Amana Books. pg.104. For the months following Davitt and Lisker's fruitless negotiations with Bryen's attorney to get Bryen to submit to an interview under oath, Phillip B. Heymann appointed Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Keuch to take over for them. Bryen's attorney continued to insist that, among other things, Justice Department investigators be barred from asking Bryen about his relations with the Israel lobby. Eventually, Keuch also failed to come to terms with Bryen's attorney on a sworn deposition of his client. Keuch, like Davitt and Lisker, came to the conclusion that Bryen should be brought before a grand jury. He wrote a memo to Heymann recommending this course of action.Saba, M. (1984). The Armageddon Network. Amana Books. pg.106. Despite two recommendations to bring the case to a grand jury, Deputy Attorney General Phillip Heymann, after further communications with Bryen's lawyer, decided to allow the suspected foreign agent to go ahead with a sworn deposition instead - a restricted deposition that would bar any questions about any matters beyond those specified by Bryen's lawyer, including Bryen's connections to the Israel lobby. As Joel Lisker, Chief of the Registration Unit at the Justice Department, turned his attention to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he encountered some more difficulties. The Committee counsel, Patrick Shea, demanded he be allowed to attend all interviews of committee staff. A Defense Week article quoted an unnamed source in the Justice Department as saying the presence of the committee lawyer had a chilling effect on the interviewees. Senator Richard Stone, a committee member, insisted on screening all documents investigators requested. Before all the requested documents were received Heymann ordered Lisker to go ahead with the deposition of Stephen Bryan. Stephen Bryen, Bryen's lawyer Nathan Lewin, and his employer Senator Clifford Case of New jersey, and demanded and were granted the right to screen all requested documents and assert privilege over those authored by Bryen or Case. Heymann insisted Lisker proceed with the deposition prior to being allowed to review the Foreign Relations Committee documents. Apparently Bryen's deposition or a description of it was not included in the many government documents the Saba acquired via FOIA requests, upon which much of The Armageddon Report is based. The Justice Department closed the case in October 1979 before Lisker received any Senate documents or finished deposing Stephen Bryen. Investigation compromised Saba reveals a troubling undisclosed relationship between Phillip Heymann, the deputy attorney general who refused to take the Stephen Bryen case to a grand jury, and Nathan Lewin, Stephen Bryen's attorney. Heymann and Lewin were old friends. Both attended Harvard Law School at the same time where Lewin was editor of the Harvard Law Review for two years prior to Heymann becoming editor while Lewin became treasurer. Heyman clerked for Supreme Court Justice John Harlan from 1960-1961 and Lewin clerked for him from 1961-62. In fact both men's careers follow an identical pattern: After the Supreme Court, Heymann joined the Justice Department's Office of Solicitor General and after his stint at the Court, Lewin joined the very same office. Heyman then moved to the State Department's Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs where he became administrator, He was joined by Lewin, who became deputy administrator in 1965. Heymann then went bact to Harvard to teach law, and sure enough Lewin a few years later did the same. Saba cites a source who says when Heymann returned to Washington to work again at the Justice Department in 1978, he stayed as a house guest of Nathan Lewin. The extensive relationship between Phillip Heymann and Nathan Lewin raises the question of why Heymann did not recuse himself from the Stephen Bryen investigation. The decision not to go to a grand jury and the subsequent concessions made to Nathan Lewin by Heymann reside under the suspicion of undue influence. Post investigation The suspicion of disloyalty cast upon him by the exposure of the meeting in the coffee shop of the Madison Hotel did not seem to do any harm to Bryen's career in government as, after a short stint as Executive Director of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), Bryen took a position as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense under Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy Richard Perle during the Reagan administration. Perle was well known as a Jewish nationalist partisan in the corridors of power in Washington. Like Bryen, Perle fell under suspicion of spying for Israel when he was caught on an FBI phone tap discussing classified material, evidently supplied to him by Kissinger aide Helmut Sonnenfeldt, with someone in the Israeli embassy.Ibid., pg.34 Perle also failed to disclose his work as a consultant for an Israeli arms manufacturer whose fee of fifty thousand dollars he received the same month he started work as Assistant Secretary for International Security Policy at the Pentagon. He then wrote a memo recommending the company as a supplier of mortars.Ibid., Pg.123-125 The National Association of Arab-Americans, for whom Saba once worked, sent letters warning numerous members of Congress and government officials of the security threat Bryen posed. No one on the Senate Armed Services Committee asked about Bryen or Perle's attachment to a certain foreign country in the Levant. After the hearing Senator Jeremiah Denton asked requested in writing that Perle answer several questions regarding the Bryen espionage investigation. Perle denied Bryen's involvement in any espionage and vouched for his loyalty and integrity. Senator James Exon went so far as to place a hold on Perle's confirmation until he could review Bryen's file, but was convinced to lift the hold by other senators.Ibid., Pgs.57-59. Richard Perle and Stephen Bryen were confirmed in their Assistant Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretary positions at the Pentagon on August 3, 1981. One of the investigators who worked the Stephen Bryen case for the Justice Department said: > I was watching the television one night when Bryen came on the screen. I > almost fell out of my chair when I saw that he was the Deputy Assistant > Secretary of Defense.

It has been referred to as a revolt, a civil war, as well as various other terms. It began in late 1925, and near the end of that year the Zaraniq would win a major battle against the Yemeni government. Over the next 2 years, large-scale fighting stagnated, with the only fighting taking place in the form of occasional raids. The rebels received arms supplies from Britain through the Ghulaifiqa port. By 1928, the rebels controlled an area stretching from Mansuriyah to Zabid. In June 1928, the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd sent 500 troops to aid the rebels. In October 1928, the Yemeni government dispatched an army to quell the rebellion, under the command of Sayf al-Islam Ahmad. Sayf marched from Sana'a to Bajil. At Bajil, he gave out that he intended to attack the Zaraniq capital of Bayt al-Faqih. However, this was merely a feint: Sayf instead attacked and captured the important rebel port of al-Ta'if. Despite the fall of al-Ta'if, rebel fortunes would see a temporary resurgence: A second army marching from al-Mukha was surprised and routed by the rebels. Bayt al-Faqih also resisted Sayf's attacks for most of 1929. These successes convinced the leader of the Zaraniq, Ahmed el Fiteini, to submit an appeal to the League of Nations for formal recognition as an independent state. However, the government's superior firepower would prove to be an insurmountable problem for the rebels, and in early October 1929 Bayt al-Faqih fell to the government and the Zaraniq surrendered, ending the rebellion. After the quelling of the revolt, a tract of land was expropriated by the Imam and the Al Hudaydah canal was constructed from the point where the wadi emerged onto a coastal plain to irrigate this tract of land. Although this new upstream canal initially took a small quantity of water, it took water throughout the year, thereby violating the principle that new lands should not be irrigated with low flows. The precedent created was used by landowners on the south bank to abstract the low flow as well. As their canals were much larger, they took the entire low flow at the expense of the downstream users.

It was made by the monks Sintram, as scribe, and Tuotilo for the treasure binding, a cover with carved ivory plaques and metal fittings. The Latin book of gospel-pericopes in format 398 x 235 mm was used to preach the gospels during mass. Today, the original evangeliary is located in the Abbey library of Saint Gall and can be found in the Codex Sangallensis under Cod. 53. It belongs to the permanent exhibition of the abbey library. It is available online as part of the “e-codices”-project of the University of Fribourg.  History  The Evangelium longum is arguably the best documented book of the Middle Ages. Not only are the patron and the artists that were involved in its creation known by name, but also the year of production of the manuscript can be exactly determined. During a dendrochronological investigation, the date when a tree was felled is calculated by means of its growth rings. Such an examination was conducted on the wooden parts of the book cover in the 1970s. Dating to the year 894 is confirmed by a tale about the origin of the Evangelium longum that was written around 1050 and belongs to the Casus Sancti Galli by Ekkehard IV. Front of the cover of the Evangelium longum The story of the manuscript begins with the ivory plaques measuring over 500 cm2 that were incorporated into the book cover. In the Casus Sancti Galli, Ekkehard comments on these plates as follows: \\"These were, however, former wax tablets to write on, like the ones that Charlemagne, according to his biographer, usually placed beside his bed when he went to sleep\\". These plates, which were formerly used by Charlemagne as writing pads, were probably bequeathed by the Emperor to the archbishopric of Mainz and thence came into the possession of Hatto, at that time Archbishop of Mainz (891–913). When Hatto had to accompany King Arnulf (850-899) to Italy, he asked his friend, Abbot Salomo of Saint Gall (890-920), to keep his treasure save during his absence. However, instead of guarding it as promised, Salomo III soon spread a rumour about Hatto’s death and took possession of his treasure. Whereas he donated most of it to the poor and gifted another part to the Minster of Constance, he also incorporated part of the treasure, for instance the two ivory plates, into the Saint Gall monastery treasure. Then he commissioned his most talented artist, the monk Tuotilo († 913) with the adornment of the plates and the monk Sintram, who was known to be a talented penman, to write an evangeliary. As Johannes Duft and Rudolf Schnyder explain, for a long time it was falsely believed that Tuotilo had only ornamented one of the two plates, as Ekkehard writes in his report that \\"one of these [ivory plates] was delightfully adorned with imagery; the other was of most delicate smoothness, and precisely that one Salomo gave Tuotilo to carve\\". Examinations with regard to the age of the carvings revealed, however, that they derive from the same time and the same hand, namely that of Tuotilo. The Evangelium longum, whose name is derived from its extraordinary oblong format, was supposed to serve as a showpiece evangeliary (dt. “Prachtevangelistar”) for important events such as the major church festivals or the arrival of guests of high-rank. Interestingly, the pericopes that form the content of the book, were created for the cover, not vice versa.  Description  = Cover = Back of the cover of the Evangelium longum The crucial element of the Evangelium longum’s cover are the two ivory plaques that were carved by Tuotilo. Now as then, their size is considered extraordinary. Ekkehard writes that the plaques are of a dimension, \\"as if the elephant furnished with such teeth had been a giant compared to his conspecifics\\". Pieces of bone were used in order to mend holes in the ivory. The front plaque of the Evangelium longum (320 x 155 mm, 9 to 12 mm thick) has Christ in Majesty in the middle; Christ is depicted in the Mandorla (almond-shaped halo), holding the Book of Life in his right hand. An alpha and an omega are engraved on both sides of his head. Moreover, Christ is flanked by two Seraphs as well as lighthouses with torches. In the corners of the frame, the evangelists (John, Matthew, Mark and Lucas) are depicted, while their symbols (eagle, winged man, lion and bull) are situated directly around Christ. According to Anton von Euw, the four evangelists represent the \\"Quadriga Virtutum\\" from Alcuin’s Doctrine of Virtue on whom man is supposed to soar up to the throne of heaven. Finally, the sun and the moon, personified by Sol and Luna, are depicted at the upper border of the image, while at the bottom, the ocean and the earth are represented by Oceanus and Tellus mater. The narrative picture field in the middle of the plate is framed by ornamental parts above and below that are separated by two bars. The bars bear the following inscription: HIC RESIDET XPC VIRTVTVM STEMMATE SEPTVS (Here Christ sits enthroned, surrounded by the wreath of virtues). The back plaque (320 x 154 mm, 9 to 10 mm thick), also called “Gall plate”, depicts the Assumption of Mary and the story of Gall and the bear, the most familiar part of Saint Gall’s founding myth. At the top, the back plate also exhibits an ornamental part and the three parts are again divided by bars. The inscription on the upper bar says ASCENSIO S[AN]C[TA]E MARI[A]E (\\"The Assumption of the holy Mary\\"), whereas the inscription on the lower bar reads S[ANCTVS] GALL[VS] PANE[M] PORRIGIT URSO (Saint Gallus hands some bread to the bear). The two ivory plaques are placed in an oak wood frame, which is mounted with fittings made of precious metal. The creation of this frame, embellished with gold and jewels from Bishop Hatto’s treasure, can also be ascribed to the monk Tuotilo. According to new research, the metal on the front plate was replaced in the 10th century. This fact could be connected to an episode reported in Ekkehard’s Casus Sancti Galli in Chapter 74 which says that in the year 954, at the reception of Abbot Craloh at the abbey, a monk did not want to present the Evangelium longum to his abbot to kiss. Instead he threw it towards him, whereby it fell to the ground and the front side was damaged. = Text = Text page of the Evangelium longum (p. 8) with golden capitals at the beginning of every sentence The text of the Evangelium longum was written by the monk Sintram, of whom Ekkehard says that \\"his fingers were admired by all the world\\" and that his \\"elegant writing’s consistency is captivating\\". Johannes Duft and Rudolf Schnyder likewise comment on the \\"admirably uniform, astonishingly steady and even hand\\". The pages were carefully ruled with a stylus and inscribed with the so-called Hartmut minuscule that was typically used in Saint Gall in the 9th century. Abbot Hartmut (872-883) himself developed this late Carolingian minuscule in and for Saint Gall. Every sentence in the Evangelium longum begins with a golden painted capital letter resulting in a total of twenty to thirty of these capitals per page. On some pages there are moreover golden initials, two of which, namely the \\"L\\" and \\"C\\" on pages 7 and 11, according to Ekkehard, were painted and gilded by Abbot Salomo himself. However, on closer examination, the initials were evidently created by the same hand as the rest of the manuscript, namely by Sintram’s. As Anton von Euw remarks, Ekkehard’s comment thus has to be interpreted as an empty phrase of praise (dt. “Ruhmesfloskel”) for the benefit of Abbot Salomo. When including the two mirror blades attached to the front and back book cover as well as the two endpapers, the Evangelium longum consists of 154 parchment sheets. Beginning at the first endpaper, the sheets were paginated by the abbey librarian Ildefons von Arx with Arabic numbers (1-304) in red ink. The average size of a page is 395 x 230 mm, the written space measures 275 x 145/165 mm and each written page consists of 29 lines.  Content  The Evangelium longum contains the gospel-pericopes which were supposed to be sung by the deacon during mass. Pages 6 and 7 are adorned with two magnificent initials: While page 6 exhibits the golden and silver painted initial \\"I\\" and the capitals IN EXPORTV S[AN]C[TA]E GENITRICIS D[EI] MARIAE, page 7 is inscribed with the bright golden capitals INITIV[M] S[AN]C[T]I EUANG[ELII] SE[CVN]D[V]M MATHEV[M] und LIBER GENERATIONIS IHV XPI. From pages 6 to 10, the Evangelium longum recounts the first chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, including Jesus’s lineage and his birth from the Virgin Mary. Page 10, which displays the initials \\"I\\" and \\"C\\" as well as the capitals INCIPIVNT LECTIONES EVANGELIOR[VM] PER ANNI CIRCVLVM LEGENDAE, commences a new part of the text: pages 11 to 233 contain the pericopes taken from the gospels which are used for the so-called Temporale, i.e. for the feasts of the Lord as well as for all the Sundays, including Wednesday and Friday, of the church year. A short appendix furthermore entails pericopes for Trinity Sunday and the votive masses from Monday to Saturday. On page 234, the second part of the Evangelium longum begins with the inscription INCIPIVNT LECTIONES EVANGELIOR[VM] DE SINGVLIS FESTIVITATIBVS S[AN]C[T]ORVM. Pages 234 to 290 thus consist of the so-called Sanctorale, meaning the pericopes for the feasts of the saints of the church year.  Subsequent history and relevance of the manuscript  Nowadays, the interior of the manuscript is still in surprisingly good condition, which indicates, according to Anton von Euw, that it was never or only rarely been opened. In contrast, Duft and Schnyder remark that the cover of the Evangelium longum has experienced at least two restorations. Before 1461, the bindings of the book block were restored, the book spine replaced and the golden applications on the front plate repaired. Probably in the 18th century, another restoration was conducted, in the course of which the book spine as well as the front gold lining were again renovated. Several factors distinguish the oblong evangeliary that is being kept in Saint Gall. Firstly, the Evangelium longum was definitely produced not only as another book, but as a showpiece evangeliary. Thus, Ekkehard writes that it is a one of a kind evangeliary, \\"of which in our opinion there will not be another one\\". The material value left aside, the Evangelium longum is moreover one of the manuscripts whose development history is the most closely documented (from before 900 until today), which makes it a work of the highest documentary value. Finally, the Evangelium longum symbolises, according to David Ganz, the connection of Saint Gall’s monastery chronicle to the court of Charlemagne as well as the then close bond between the abbey and the Archbishopric of Mainz.

In 1943, she became the first commander of a women's expeditionary force, the 149th WAAC Post Headquarters Company, which served in General Eisenhower's North African headquarters. Before her military service, she held management posts in women's organizations; afterwards, she did volunteer work for women's groups, including serving as a United Nations observer for Altrusa International. She died on August 4, 1984 in New York City.  Early life, education, and marriage  Frances Eleanor Keegan was born on October 15, 1896, in West Newbury, Massachusetts, the third daughter among the four children of John L. Keegan and Margaret E. Costello. Her parents were first generation Irish: the Costellos from Tipperary and the Keegans from Kildare. John Keegan had a career as superintendent of machine tool manufacturing. At age eighty, he came out of retirement to help the war effort in World War II. Marquis graduated from high school in West Newbury in 1911. Because she was only fourteen, Simmons College would not allow her to matriculate without a one-year wait. She graduated with a BA in 1916, the youngest in her class. Her college yearbook listed Marquis among the class' Brightest, Best Student, and Most Promising. Marquis later took courses in economics at the University of Illinois and philosophy at Columbia University. In 1931 she met and married Harry Goshen Marquis, a ginger-ale salesman at the time; it was a second marriage for each of them. Articles profiling his wife called him a New York businessman and World War I veteran left home alone to carry on as she went off to war.  Career in women's organizations  Marquis held a number of executive positions, often relating to women's issues or women's improvement. She managed Boston's Franklin Square House, a non-profit residence hotel providing housing and social services for some 700 unmarried women students and wage earners. At Franklin Square House, women in a wide range of professions from all over country lived under one roof. From 1919 through 1933, Frances Keegan Marquis fundraised for and then was a manager at The Town Hall in New York City. The Town Hall was an offshoot of New York's women's suffrage movement, specifically the League for Political Education. This wealthy and influential group determined to construct a public forum for debate that would overcome the kind of \\"ignorance and prejudice\\" that impeded the women's vote. The Town Hall hosted not only important speakers (including birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, who was arrested when attempting to speak there in November 1921) but also many musical performances, for which Marquis served as concert manager. Later, between 1935 and 1941, Marquis served as the assistant director in charge of education and recreation programs of the American Woman's Association. Founded by Anne Morgan and other prominent New Yorkers, the American Woman's Association was created as a place where a working woman with drive and energy could network and develop leadership skills. In Morgan's view, although no women of the time were equipped to head a large corporation, \\"in time there will be plenty of such women—it requires only evolution.\\" By 1930, when it constructed its own building in New York City, the association (which was non-sectarian and was said to include every nationality) had a membership of some 4,000, representing over 150 businesses and professions. Along with a roof garden, numerous parlors, meeting rooms, and residential space, the association's building featured a premier fitness center including a swimming pool. In 1941, Marquis became executive secretary of the Women's City Club of New York. Like The Town Hall, the club had roots in the suffrage movement and owned a series of impressive clubhouses in Manhattan, moving during Marquis' tenure to the same building that housed the all-male City Club. Luminaries including Eleanor Roosevelt led the club, which advocated for civic betterment and particularly women's issues such as women's employment, birth control, and maternity care. As war raged abroad during Marquis' time as executive secretary, the Women's City Club turned to women's duty to contribute to defense and the war effort.  Military service during World War II  On July 20, 1942, Frances Keegan Marquis joined the first Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) officer training class at the Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School. Chosen from some 30,000 applicants, she was one of 440 in her class, of whom 90% had attended college and 99% had successful civilian careers. She said she joined because \\"for eight years ... this country had neglected its obligations and 'when there was an opportunity to do something, I felt that I who had talked so much about it, had to do it.'\\" Upon graduation on August 29, 1942, at age 46 Marquis entered the military and was assigned to WAAC headquarters in Washington, D.C. = Command of first expeditionary WAACs = Over the 1942 Christmas holidays, Marquis became the first woman to command a troop train, which carried the newly-formed 149th WAAC Post Headquarters Company now under her command from the Second WAAC Training Center in Daytona, Florida, to the New York area. From there, this company of almost 200 sailed to North Africa, reporting to General Dwight Eisenhower's headquarters in Algiers on January 27, 1943. Women of the 149th, who volunteered for service abroad, comprised a hand-picked cadre of linguists and specialists who assumed secretarial, postal, switchboard, and other duties. Describing the 149th, Ernie Pyle stated, \\"When a WAC takes over a switchboard from a soldier, efficiency goes up about 1000 percent.\\" As the first to command an American women's expeditionary force, Frances Keegan Marquis became the subject of considerable attention. In the summer of 1943, she met with England's King George VI, discussing the work of the WAACs and British-American relations after the war. Nationwide news reports carried her photo; discussed her appearance (curly brown hair in a bob, twinkling blue eyes), demeanor (\\"dignity of assurance,\\" \\"undertone of confidence,\\" emphasis on a sense of humor), feminine attributes (nose powdering, lemon pie making); and mentioned her prior career. Deployment abroad compounded start-up problems facing the WAACs. Upon arrival in Algiers, it was discovered that the 149th's vehicles had been issued to a male unit and items ranging from kitchen equipment to typewriters had disappeared. Army historian Mattie Treadwell stated that an obvious problem was the auxiliary system itself. It was infeasible to deny Army commanders the ability to command the women working for them and to apply differing rules for women. Army men in a war zone received such additional benefits as extra pay, government life insurance, veteran's medical care if injured. WAACs in the war theater did not. Pressing issues were incapable of resolution within a meaningful time frame. A staff member commented, \\"The Corps was placed in the position of a small businessman who overnight was told he must increase his business more than eight times, and to do it at once even before he knew what he was to produc[e], out of what materials, when or how the product was to be made, and with practically no organization to assist.\\" = Transition to Women's Army Corps = Although headlines asserted that Marquis was a popular commander, this was not universally so. Hoping for a familiar officer, at least some of her troops would not have chosen her: they were \\"quite surprised at the designation of this 'stranger.'\\" According to Sergeant Vida Ganoni's memoir, a little over two weeks after their arrival in Algiers, on February 11, 1943, an announcement of promotions caused an uproar. Those not promoted felt that Marquis' decisions were based on favoritism, not ability. With the July 1, 1943 enactment of legislation converting the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps to the Women's Army Corps (WACs), the women were given the summer to decide whether to apply to join the Army upon the September 1943 changeover. During this time, changes such as more dispersed housing assignments and the unit's absorption into the 6666th or 6667th Hq Co, WAC—which applied to all women in the theater—caused significant unhappiness in the ranks that identified themselves as close-knit 149ers. The final break occurred when a popular sergeant was suddenly relieved of her duties. Some sided with the sergeant, others with the commander: the \\"unity of the 149th collapsed.\\" Treadwell's Army history attributed the situation to administrative difficulties and the lack of a WAAC staff director for the theater—a one-time mistake. When General Eisenhower learned that a large number of the 149th did not plan to continue as WACs, he requested that a highly competent senior WAAC officer be sent immediately. In view of the troops' state of mind, this officer, then-Major Westray Boyce, acted swiftly. \\"The previous company officers and key cadre were returned to the United States in a body, since it appeared impossible to place individual responsibility or to restore the women's lost confidence; all later proved successful in a variety of duties in the United States.\\" Noting \\"the almost insurmountable difficulties attendant upon life and conditions in an active theater of war\\" that confronted Marquis upon arrival in North Africa, Colonel R.Q. Brown, commander of the Headquarters Special Troops, highly recommended Marquis for any future position, staff or command. \\"Through the first months of adjusting the routine and movement of the WAACs in a foreign country under difficult conditions, Captain Marquis performed her duties in a superior manner. She was always willing and ready to accept recommendations both as to personnel and living conditions and to place such recommendations into effect in her company. As a result the company was able to adapt itself to existing conditions and was soon considered an integral part of Allied Force Headquarters.\\" = Recruiting tour = Upon her return to the States in October 1943, Marquis was assigned to assist in the WAC recruiting drive with speeches and interviews describing her time in North Africa. Myriad problems ranging from counterproductive messaging to active obstruction from the War Manpower Commission afflicted WAC recruiting, but a slander campaign proved a largely unstoppable blow. Although many sources spawned and fed bad jokes and ugly rumors about military women, contemporaneous and historicalAnn Pfau, Miss Yourlovin: GIs, Gender, and Domesticity during World War II (Columbia University Press, 2008), chap. 2, online \\"Forced to retract his allegations, O'Donnell and his publisher remained determined to discredit the corps. Soon after this incident, O'Donnell was discovered 'canvassing Army general hospitals.' He sought [to] ascertain the number of Waacs hospitalized for pregnancy and thus defend his reputation with undeniable proof of promiscuity.\\" Footnote omitted. accounts have focused on the work of syndicated columnist John O'Donnell. According to an Army history, even with its hasty retraction, O'Donnell's June 8, 1943, \\"Capitol Stuff\\" column did \\"incalculable damage.\\" That column began, \\"Contraceptives and prophylactic equipment will be furnished to members of the WAACS, according to a super secret agreement reached by the high ranking officers of the War Department and the WAAC chieftain, Mrs. William Pettus Hobby….\\" This followed O'Donnell's June 7 column discussing efforts of women journalists and congresswomen to dispel \\"the gaudy stories of the gay and careless way in which the young ladies in uniform … disport themselves….\\" Of particular concern for Marquis and the 149th, that column repeated the admittedly unsubstantiated falsehood that large numbers of WACs had been sent home pregnant from North Africa. While still abroad, Marquis participated in a counteroffensive with newspaper and radio interviews discussing her troops' life in the military, including their commitment as volunteers, qualifications and training, assignments, long work hours, supervised social life, and housing in a convent. In one of her first press conferences upon returning to New York, Marquis told fascinating stories of the WACs in North Africa and responded with a strong denial when asked \\"how many WACs were really sent home for disorderly conduct and pregnancy.\\" In truth, the only pregnant 149er was married to an Army officer—she had not discovered her condition until after she arrived in the theater, at which point she returned home. Marquis was sent on a well-publicized nationwide tour, speaking to women's groups, WAC trainees, college women, and business groups about the WACs' overseas experiences.thumbright Insignia of 1st Regiment of Zouaves, awarded to Capt. Frances Marquis - Courtesy of West Newbury Historical Society Marquis later attended the Command and General Staff School. She was awaiting reassignment when, at the war's end, she was discharged late in 1945. = Medals = On April 9, 1943, Colonel J.C. Gross, commandant of the 1st Regiment Zouaves (\\"valient of the valients\\") awarded Marquis the medal insignia of that regiment, making her an honorary member. Around the time Marquis' WAACs arrived in Algiers, Zouave forces (with roots as local North Africans in the French Army), were the first to stop the Nazi advance at Medjez-El-Bab in Tunisia. Vastly outnumbered and equipped with World War I era rifles, the Zouaves beat back German and Italian forces in a 36-hour battle. When this North African victory helped turn the tide for the French, the Americans promised them modern supplies. By November 1943, a modernized, American- equipped French Army—notably including the Zouaves—was ready to invade Europe from North Africa. During this period, the WAACs played a part in strengthening ties with the French: in July General Henri Giraud, commander of the French forces, reviewed Marquis' troops (finding them \\"inspiring\\") and later in the summer of 1943, the WACs and their French counterparts (one of whose officers was the wife of Colonel Gross) paraded together with a 1st Regiment Zouave color guard. Along with her WAC and overseas service ribbons, Marquis' Zouave medal became part of her uniform.Bonne Volontḗ Franco- Amḗricaine Medal, awarded to Capt. Frances Marquis - Courtesy of West Newbury Historical Society On the eve of her departure from Algiers in late September 1943, the Franco-American Goodwill Society (Bonne Volontḗ Franco-Amḗricaine) held a luncheon to honor Marquis. At this event, the society's board of directors presented her with a medal honoring her contributions to French- American friendship.  Post-war volunteer work  After leaving the military, Marquis undertook volunteer work. Having previously served Altrusa (an organization of professional women's clubs focused on community service) as president of the New York City chapter and publicity chairman of the international organization of clubs, Marquis became Altrusa International's official United Nations observer and traveled about the country giving speeches on the workings of the United Nations. She served in that role, participating with U.N. observer status, for seven years. Marquis was also active in such organizations as Camp Fire Girls, serving as the president of the Council of Greater New York and representing New York on the National Council.  Death and legacy  Frances Keegan Marquis died on August 4, 1984 at her home in Manhattan, leaving no immediate survivors. She maintained ties to friends in her home town of West Newbury throughout her life, however. Marquis became a life member of the West Newbury Historical Society in 1960 and later donated some of her papers and medals to that organization. In 1987 the West Newbury Historical Society mounted an exhibit of her military artifacts.

Biography and Career Son of Emanuele and Aloisa Bassano, at the age of ten was admitted to the conservatorio S. Maria di Loreto where he studied music for twelve years under :de:Gian Carlo Cailò. With the support of Alessandro Scarlatti, Alborea became member of the Regia Cappella di Napoli until 1727. In the same year, he moved to Vienna, where was employed as cellist at the imperial court, with a salary of 1260 florins, until his death. Alborea was one of the first virtuoso soloist cellists.

At the end of the piece, Scarlatti declared that only an angel, in human form, could play in such a charming way. Alborea was praised, among others, by Johann Joachim Quantz, Franz Benda and Martin Berteau, who, according to Fétis, left the viola da gamba for the cello after hearing Alborea playing.

She is remembered in particular for introducing ear training into the curriculum of the Royal Danish Academy of Music and related institutions. She adapted and expanded the approach she had learnt in Rome, Berlin and Paris by publishing textbooks and demonstrating it to students in Sweden and the Netherlands. Thanks to Borup, ear training became a key aspect of education offered by her students, including the organist Ebba Nielsen and the pianist Merete Westergaard. Biography Born on 25 February 1867 in Horsens, Emilie Marie Dagmar Alexandersen was the daughter of the house painter Peder Alexandersen (1830–1904) and Helene Stockholm (1877–1896). Together with her two sisters, she was raised in a warm bourgeois home. After entering the Royal Academy in 1886, she met the violinist Julius Borup (1865–1938) whom she married in 1896. She also became a close friend of Carl Nielsen and his wife Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen. She was a fine pianist, frequently performing at concerts with her husband. Borup had to abandon her career as a pianist when she began to suffer from a nerve disorder in her arms. When she was 58, she attended solfège classes at the Paris Conservatoire, drawing on the works of Albert Lavignac including Solfèges des solfèges. While the aural approach had been practised in schools, it had not been used in higher education. Borup succeeded in having it adopted by the Royal Danish Ballet school where she was teaching in 1927 and in 1930, she had it included in the curriculum of the Royal Music Academy where she taught from 1930 to 1936. She trained some 40 of her students in the aural method at the academy and used the ballet school as a practical setting for examining those who intended to become academics. Dagmar Borup died in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen on 14 January 1959.

His work is embedded in the Catholic current. He wrote both historical novels related to the History of Poland as well as contemporary novels. Biography Władysław Jan Grabski was born on 21 October 1901 in Warsaw to Władysław Grabski, Prime Minister of Poland who served three times, and Katarzyna née Lewandowska. He spent his childhood as described in the autobiographical novel Scarves of Childhood in Borów and St. Petersburg. In the years of 1912–1914, he attended the Konopczyński Junior High School. After the outbreak of World War I, he went with his parents to St. Petersburg, where he studied at the Moscow School of the Order of St Catherine, with a six-month break, when, after the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in mid-1917, she and her mother and siblings moved to Feodosia in Crimea. In April 1918, after the conclusion of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the whole family returned to Warsaw. In 1920, he graduated from the Adam Mickiewicz Gymnasium in Vilnius. In July, he volunteered for the Volunteer Army, served in the 24th Uhlan Regiment and took part in operations in Central Lithuania. After the demobilization on November 25, 1920, he started studying at the Faculty of Law of the University of Warsaw. After graduating in 1924, he went to Sorbonne, where he studied the history of economic doctrines as well as the history of the Middle Ages, then returned to the University of Warsaw and obtained a doctorate in 1927 for his work on Charles Fourier. Because his father gave him part of his estate in Grabkowo in the spring of 1927. He completed several months of gardening practices, among others was Jean Dybowski in Puławy. In November 1927, he married Zofia Wojciechowska who was a painter and daughter of the President of Poland Stanisław Wojciechowski and First Lady Maria Wojciechowska. After their marriage, they settled in a house built for them by his father in Grabków, where they lived until their death. From 1927 to 1929, Grabski worked at the Economic Office of the National Bank of Poland. In 1929, he was diagnosed with Advanced Pulmonary Tuberculosis. After long-term treatment in sanatoriums in Zakopane, Vienna Woods and Davos he returned to Grabków, but the consequences of the disease were to accompany him for the rest of his life. Since then, he devoted himself to writing and journalism. He was associated with the national movement. He did journalism in the magazines such as the ABC daily and the Prosto z mostu artistic and literary weekly edited by the national activist and journalist Stanisław Piasecki with whom he was friends with. Through him, he made contact with Bolesław Piasecki and the emerging National Radical Camp. He was among the people who signed the Principles of the National Radical Program in 1937, but soon became discouraged as a result of this movement joining the sanation Obóz Zjednoczenia Narodowego (OZN), as well as their radical anti-Semitism, which he expressed by publishing a poem in 1937 entitled Przytyk pogrom. From 1938, he was a member of the Trade Union of Polish Writers. At that time, he began studies in Paris on the history of Western Slavs in the early days of Poland and the Middle Ages, which he used in his later work. He participated in the September campaign as a volunteer in the Chełm Regiment Zborny, he took part in the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski. Together with his regiment, he was surrounded by the Red Army near Kamionka Strumiłłowa on the bug. He managed to return to Grabków on October 17, after taking off his uniform. During the occupation, he was a member of the Home Army for the Polish Underground State. He also hid Jews and survived the war with his family in Grabków. In March 1945, he was persuaded by Edward Ochab, who was then the government's representative for the Regained Territories, to become his scientific adviser. This work, which at Grabski's request was not related to remuneration, continued in the newly created Ministry of Regained Territories. He wrote the brochure distributed to displaced persons Poland on the Oder, Neisse and Pasłęka and prepared a historical guide of the history of the cities of Western lands titled 200 cities return to Poland in 1947, in which his father- in-law helped the author. In 1948, he left the ministry in protest against the position represented by the authorities against the so-called native people. Cardinal August Hlond appointed him to the Primate's Council for the Reconstruction of Warsaw Churches, where he led the propaganda section and wrote the text for the album Churches of Warsaw in Reconstruction, which, however, was granted censorship permission for printing only in 1956. He also published in Tygodnik Warszawski and Tygodnik Powszechny. From the end of 1950, the censorship \\"record\\" began to apply to him, which in practice deprived him of the possibility of publishing. The harassment also extended to his sons. In June 1955, a peer court of the Union of Polish Writers deleted him from the list of members for writing an unpublished Catholic Ballade, which was impressed by Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński, with whom he had been friends since the time of cooperation with Prosto z Mostu. In support of the ruling, it was stated that the ideological atmosphere of the song was \\"deeply contradictory to humanistic ideas\\" in force in the Związek Literatów Polskich (ZLP) and \\"works to violate the patriotic unity of our nation\\". Fearful of a search at home, he destroyed several manuscripts, including most of the already completed novel Cale God. Her remaining fragment was published in 1961 in the short story Tartak started. The trial was a great shock for Grabski, traces of which can be found in the introduction to the Scar of Childhood and in the poem To a friend of Ballada , published in the volume of poetry Świat na podararu (1958). Half a year after the trial, the aftermath of tuberculosis was renewed. During his several months in hospital, the political climate in Poland began to change and in June 1956, the plenum of the Polish People's Party reactivated him as a member, however, he did not see rehabilitation. During his first stay in the Union after a break, in September 1956, at the election meeting of delegates, he advocated for imprisoned Primate Stefan Wyszyński. Later, he held certain functions in the Board of the Association. He was also an active member of the PEN Club. After 1956, he established cooperation with the PAX Publishing Institute, but he was not a member himself, in which he published his subsequent books. He was the first president of the Krąg literary club publishing house . He wrote for the weekly \\"Kierunki\\" and \\"Wrocław Weekly Catholic\\", published by PAX. In 1967 there was another renewal of the disease and final exclusion from public life. After a two-year stay in the hospital, he returned home for a year and finished work on the Scar of childhood (1971). In August 1970 he was taken to the hospital again, where he died on November 1970, at the age of 68. He is buried in Powązki Cemetery. Zofia and Władysław's grave in Powązki Cemetery Creativity He made his debut in 1923 with the poetic volume 'Russia. Pictures and thoughts with a poem \\"created under the influence of the author's experiences during the October Revolution. During his stay in France, he published a volume of sonnets \\"Three Wreaths\\" by the Polish Society of Book Friends in Paris. Part of the edition was published in a numbered bibliophile edition illustrated with engravings signed by their authors such as Wacław Zawadowski, Franciszek Prochaska and Konrad Brandel. The first novel, Brothers, who initiated the three-volume series, presenting critically the political situation in Poland in the period from the assassination of President Narutowicz to the time after the May Revolution. It first appeared in episodes, often confiscated by censorship, in the national daily ABC (1933), and the later (1934) book edition of the Rój Publishing Society was also \\"decorated\\" with white pages by censorship. Among other things, a text describing the meeting of President Stanisław Wojciechowski with Józef Piłsudski on the Poniatowski Bridge during the May Coup in 1926. He did not want to publish further volumes of the series swarm for political reasons, but the Poznań Printing and Bookstore of St. Wojciech. In 1935, it appeared in the same publication Lie, and the following year the last volume cycle on the edge. He also wrote several novels in episodes under pseudonyms, including in Dziennik Poznański, the crime story Bloody Traces, and under his own name Rust of life, which, however, he did not later publish in book form due to anti- Semitic accents appearing in it and in the meantime. In the years 1937–1938, he gave up political issues, and in his work, there was a fundamental shift towards universally understood Christianity.

The movement organized an ongoing series of peaceful demonstrations to protest against the right-wing surge in the country and, more specifically, against the political rhetoric of right-wing leader Matteo Salvini. The name \\"Sardines\\" came from the idea of organizing their rallies with high numbers of participants, packed together like sardines in a shoal. While the movement de facto ended after the centre-left victory in the January 2020 election in Emilia-Romagna, it formally ended in May.Sardine verso l'addio, Santori \\"Ci prendiamo una pausa di riflessione, Corriere Della Sera History =Birth in Emilia-Romagna= The Sardines movement started as a flash mob on 14 November 2019, organized in Piazza Maggiore, the main square of Bologna, Emilia-Romagna. The aim of the event was to contrast the launch of Matteo Salvini's electoral campaign for the 2020 regional election at the PalaDozza in Bologna. The slogan of the event was \\"Bologna non si Lega\\", which literally translates to \\"Bologna does not tie itself up\\", but it also plays with the name of Salvini's party, Lega. The flash mob, which was named \\"6,000 Sardines against Salvini\\" (\\"\\"), was joined by almost 15,000 people, surprising the whole country and receiving a large media coverage. The movement rose up during the electoral campaign for the 2020 Emilia-Romagna regional election, which has been considered as the first competitive one in the history of the region. Emilia-Romagna has been a stronghold of left-wing parties since the end of the World War II, but in the 2018 general election the centre-right coalition became the largest political force in the region. The Sardines movement started its activity with the aim of preventing a right-wing victory in the January 2020 election. The first Sardines' rally was warmly welcomed by the Democratic Party (PD), especially by its secretary Nicola Zingaretti, its president and former Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Emilia-Romagna incumbent governor Stefano Bonaccini. Former Prime Minister and PD's founding father, Romano Prodi, stated that the Sardines are \\"formidable\\", adding that they must not be neither \\"colonized\\" nor \\"exploited\\" by any party. On 18 November, a second Sardines' rally gathered Piazza Grande in Modena, with more than 7,000 people taking part in the event. =Spreading through the country= Sardine's rally in Modena In December, the movement spread outside Emilia-Romagna. On 1 December, more than 25,000 people participated in a rally in Piazza Duomo in Milan, while on the previous day, almost 30,000 gathered Piazza della Repubblica in Florence. On 10 December, 40,000 people demonstrated in Turin in Piazza Castello. Other protests have been staged in Naples and Palermo. On 14 December, one month after their first rally, Sardines organized a demonstration in Rome at Piazza San Giovanni. According to the organizers almost 100,000 people joined the rally. During Rome's demonstration, Sardines' de facto leader, Mattia Santori, presented the movement's proposals to politics, which included, among others, political transparency, condemnation of hate speech, laws against verbal violence and a new immigration policies. Santori especially asked to Giuseppe Conte's government to abolish the so-called \\"Salvini Decree\\", a law approved by the previous government, which contained a series of hardline measures that abolished key forms of protection for migrants and made it easier for them to be deported. The decree also suspended the refugee application process of those who were considered \\"socially dangerous\\" or who had been convicted of a crime. On the same day, smaller demonstrations also took place in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. On 19 January, the movement returned in Bologna, with more than 40,000 people attending a rally in Piazza VIII Agosto. It was the last demonstration before the January 26 regional election and was named \\"Welcome back to open sea\\". The rally was characterized by a 6-hour long concert with singers and artists like Afterhours, Subsonica, Marracash, Matilda De Angelis, Skiantos, Casa del vento, Bandabardò, Modena City Ramblers, Marlene Kuntz and Pif.Bentornati in mare aperto On 26 January, at the Emilia-Romagna regional election, the PD's candidate Stefano Bonaccini – endorsed by the sardines movement – won with 51.4% of the votes, with a 7.7% margin above the League's candidate Lucia Borgonzoni. Some attributed part of Bonaccini's success to the movement's support and activity. Ideology The movement declares itself not linked to any party and to mainly pursue the ideals of anti-fascism and the fight against racial discrimination, as well as the rejection of right-wing populism and verbal violence in Italian politics, which they claim should be legally considered as physical violence. The Sardines movement has been generally considered on the left-wing of the political spectrum and has been compared to Girotondi and Purple People, two grassroots movements which rose up in the 2000s to protest against then Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. According to some political commentators, the movement would be limited only to a generic critique of the right-wing, with its open opposition to Matteo Salvini, who is depicted as an authoritarian and undemocratic leader. Moreover critics accused the Sardines of supporting the ruling centre-left government of Giuseppe Conte.Chi sono le \\"sardine\\": storia di un movimento e del suo nome Notes References Category:2019 establishments in Italy Category:2019 protests Category:December 2019 events in Italy Category:November 2019 events in Italy Category:Protests in Italy Category:Social movements in Europe ","title":"Sardines movement"},{"id":"62598043","text":"Thomas Bergman (born 9 February 1960) is a former Swedish football player.

It is named after the company \\"Siemens & Halske\\", which built the route independently between 1927 and 1929. It is almost four and a half kilometers long and has been out of service since the Reichsbahner strike in September 1980. There are plans to reactivate the route by 2025.  Description  The Siemensbahn starts at Jungfernheide station, where it is connected to the Ringbahn. From there it runs west and branches off at approximately the same height as the Ringbahn from the Hamburger Bahn. Unlike this, however, it takes the route north across the Spree and first reaches Wernerwerk station. After the station, it makes an extensive 90-degree angle, runs briefly to the west, where the Siemensstadt station is located (both in the district of Siemensstadt), and then to the northwest. After a good kilometer it reaches the terminus Gartenfeld in the locality of the same name. This was additionally equipped with an equestrian signal box and a six-track parking facility. Almost the entire length of the route is designed as a viaduct railway, only the terminus at Gartenfeld is at ground level. Its grounds and buildings have since been used by a garden center that has been abandoned since 2012.  History  In 1905, the Siemens group had its own train station set up for its employees so that they could get to work faster. The station opened on the Hamburg and Lehrter Bahn as Fürstenbrunn (later: Siemensstadt- Fürstenbrunn) initially had high passenger numbers, but was still unfavorable on the site. Since the factory center also moved to northern Siemensstadt in the 1920s, the factory management was looking for an alternative solution. In 1925 Siemens and the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) agreed to build a new route. The construction of the route and the equipment of the stations took over the Siemens Bauunion. The company provided the site. The Reichsbahn was only supposed to ensure operation. This arrangement was also possible because CEO Carl Friedrich von Siemens was also President of the Board of Directors of the DRG. Construction began in 1927 and was completed in two years. On December 18, 1929, traffic began. The trains were electric, the great electrification of the Berlin city, ring and suburban railways was just in full swing. In the first few years the trains ran to Neukölln or Papestrasse. Passenger numbers rose significantly, with the route being largely used by workers at the Siemens plants. Of the roughly 90,000 employees that Siemens employed in Siemensstadt at the time, around 17,000 used the S-Bahn to and from their workplace every five minutes. A development plan by Albert Speer provided for a transfer station at the end of the route. The route was damaged in the Second World War. So the Spree Bridge was destroyed just behind the junction. Already on September 17, 1945 it could be replaced by a makeshift bridge. At this point, the Siemens freight railway had already been provisionally connected to the Gartenfeld S-Bahn station via a wooden ramp, since the Wehrmacht had blown up the Spree Bridge. The second track was delivered to the Soviet Union as a reparation payment. Up to April 28, 1948, freight traffic took place predominantly in the night hours on the S-Bahn track. The connection remained until March 1950 because Siemens repaired S-Bahn cars for the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The two-track operation was resumed on December 3, 1956 after the new Spree Bridge was built. The previous number of users was no longer achieved because the Siemens group had moved its headquarters to Munich. From then on, the route was one of the least used in the entire Berlin S-Bahn network. As a result, the trains were pulled back to Jungfernheide, and mostly older vehicles of the ET 168 and ET 165 series were used, which last ran every 20 minutes with 30 to 40 passengers.  Closing  After the Reichsbahner strike in September 1980, traffic was stopped. With the Siemensdamm and Rohrdamm stations on the U7 underground line, which opened in October 1980, Siemensstadt had an alternative to the Wernerwerk and Siemensstadt stations. In August 1995, the section of the route between the district border to Spandau and the Gartenfeld station was listed. In 2005, when the Charlottenburg lock was built, the Spree was relocated, partially removing the railway embankment between the junction of the ring railway and the southern bank of the Spree and demolishing the foreland bridge of the Spree bridge. In 2007 the Berlin Senate objected to the deconstruction of the railway site requested by the Federal Railway Authority. Negotiations between the Deutsche Regionalale and Deutsche Bahn to take over the infrastructure between Wernerwerk and Gartenfeld were unsuccessful in 2008. Since the decommissioning, Deutsche Bahn AG or the districts of Spandau and Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, in which the railway line runs, have carried out only a few maintenance works on the decaying and overgrown track systems, the substructure and the train stations. The Deutsche Bahn estimated its costs for securing the route at 500,000 euros annually. Later she estimated the effort for three years (2013-2015) to only 133,000 euros.  Reactivation and expansion plans  In 2014, the architect and lecturer at the Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences Rebecca Chestnutt-Niess worked with students to develop designs for subsequent use. The re-urbanization project of the Siemensbahn included the establishment of a swimming lane on a section of the route, the targeted greening of the viaduct and the setting up of a foot and cycle path. The proposals were issued in July 2014 at Halemweg 21, a former Schlecker branch. The Siemensbahn is still included in the Berlin land use plan from November 2017. After that, it should also be possible to extend it beyond Gartenfeld via Daumstraße (Wasserstadt Oberhavel) to Hakenfelde. The route would run along the old Berlin-Spandau shipping canal, through the beaver protection area and parallel to Rhenaniastraße to a new Daumstraße station and then cross or cross the Havel to the new terminus at Hakenfelde on Streitstraße, south of the Goltzstraße intersection. In the course of the early public participation of the new building project \\"Neues Gartenfeld\\", the Senate Administration presented a line deviating from the land use plan: The Gartenfeld island would have been crossed underneath and the route north along the Rohrbruchtich to Daumstrasse would have been led. According to this planning, the Gartenfeld station would have to be relocated to the Gartenfeld island. How much the restart would cost has not yet been estimated. After Siemens AG decided in October 2018 to build a campus in Siemensstadt for research purposes, the group and the Senate spoke out in favor of reactivating the Siemensbahn. In combination with the further expansion of the water city and the new construction of the island of Gartenfeld, the need to reactivate the Siemens Railway is increasing. The Berlin Senate wish to be reactivated by 2025, it said. The reconstruction was subsequently included in the i2030 transport project of the two federal states of Berlin and Brandenburg and the DB AG. In November 2019, DB Netz AG tendered for the creation of a feasibility study for the second construction phase Gartenfeld - Hakenfelde across Europe. The study includes various route options for a two-track extension for a maximum speed of 100 km/h with the intermediate stops \\"Gartenfeld\\", \\"Wasserstadt Oberhavel\\" and \\"Hakenfelde\\".

Life  Suzanne Masson was hired as a designer at the Rateau factory (now Alstom) in La Courneuve, a northern suburb of Paris, where from the mid-1920s, she was an industrial design technician, the only woman at this level of qualification at the factory. In 1926 she became a member of a local labor group, abbreviated CGT. In February 1934 she joined the French communist party. In 1938 she was released from the turbine factory because of her involvement in strikes there with the federation of the French Communist Party of the Seine. She took part in solidarity actions with republican Spain fighters and their anti-fascism efforts. In 1939, after the French Communist Party was banned, she continued to work for it illegally. After German troops occupied Paris on June 14, Masson distributed leaflets and organized peoples' committees. In La Courneuve, she was instrumental in setting up the local resistance group and with her CGT comrades who had gone underground. On February 5, 1942, she was discovered and fled to her house at 95, boulevard Macdonald in Paris where she was arrested by the police of the French Vichy government who were cooperating with German occupiers. First interned in the women's prison at Petite-Roquette ND then at the \\"Health\\" prison called La Santé in France, she was finally delivered to the Gestapo who deported her to Germany. On May 18, 1942, she was sent to Karlsruhe and later transferred to Anrath. In June 1943 at Lauerhof prison, she was tried for possession of weapons, her calls for resistance against the German occupiers, and her clandestine connections with the French Communist Party. As a result, she was sentenced to death. She was given the opportunity to plea for mercy but she refused to do so, declaring in court that it was her duty as a French patriot and communist to fight for humanity. On November 1, 1943, she was guillotined in the Hamburg prison courtyard. Commemorative plaque on the back of the Holstenglacis remand center in Hamburg.  Honors  In 1946, Masson was posthumously given the French Order of Merit and appointed Knight of the French Legion of Honor by Ambroise Croizat, Minister of Labor and Social Security. In October 1950, a Paris trade union educational institution, the Suzanne Masson Center (in the 12th arrondissement of Paris), was named after her. Each year, the Center commemorates May 8, 1945, the \\"date of the victory of freedom against barbarism\\" and to \\"pay tribute to those who fought Nazism at the risk of their lives, such as Suzanne Masson.\\" In 2005, a street (the rue de la Gare), near the La Courneuve - Aubervilliers railway station, was renamed rue Suzanne- Masson. On the site of the Hamburg prison, a plaque on the back wall of the detention center commemorates the two fighters who were killed there. A translation of the inscription reads: > France Bloch-Sérazin, February 21, 1913  February 12, 1943 Suzanne Masson, > July 10, 1901 - November 1, 1943 These two French women were beheaded with a > guillotine in this prison because of their resistance to National Socialist > tyranny in occupied France.

Life  Born in Budapest, Eibenschütz was the daughter of a merchant. She studied singing at the Konservatorium Wien Privatuniversität with Josef Gänsbacher and Marianne Brandt.

In 1896, Arthur resigned in protest at the appointment of an assistant general secretary, J. Lamb. Lamb soon fell into conflict with the union's new general secretary, Michael Deller. After only three months, Thomas Otley replaced Lamb in the role, and worked closely with Deller. Deller died in January 1906, and Otley was appointed as acting general secretary. He easily won election to the permanent post, in which he focused on administration and made few changes. The union was struggling financially, and in 1909 the assistant general secretary was made redundant. He did arrange for the purchase of a new head office, at 37 Albert Street in London. From 1910, membership began increasing again, the Cork City Society of Plasterers joining the union, and the National Health Insurance Act 1911 giving it a key welfare role in the industry. The union also became a founder member of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives, and Otley served on its Emergency Committee. In July 1922, while on holiday, Otley went sea swimming.

He took the society into the Amalgamated Union of Upholsterers (AUU), and in 1894 he became the secretary of a new branch of the union, catering for piece workers.

He was able to increase membership sufficiently that, by 1901, he became the union's first full-time general secretary. As leader of the union, Leckie affiliated it to the Labour Representation Committee. He also tried to arrange a merger between it, the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association (NAFTA), the Amalgamated Union of Cabinetmakers and the Amalgamated Society of French Polishers, but discussions in both 1909 and 1913 failed as agreement could not be reached on levels of membership fees and benefits.

It was one of the first 'Mixed' regiments in which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated into the unit's personnel. It defended West Yorkshire and the North Midlands against aerial attack until it became the first Mixed anti-aircraft (AA) unit to serve overseas, defending Brussels against V-1 flying bombs. Organisation Auxiliary Territorial Service cap badge By 1941, after almost two years of war Anti-Aircraft Command, tasked with defending the UK against air attack, was suffering a manpower shortage. In April its commander-in- chief, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile, proposed to overcome this by utilising the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The ATS was by law a non-combatant service, but it was decided that Defence Regulations permitted the employment of women in anti-aircraft (AA) roles other than actually firing the guns. They worked the radar and plotting instruments, range-finders and predictors, ran command posts and communications, and carried out many other duties. With the increasing automation of heavy AA (HAA) guns, including gun-laying, fuze-setting and ammunition loading under remote control from the predictor, the question of who actually fired the gun became blurred as the war progressed. The ATS rank and file, if not always their officers, took to the new role with enthusiasm and 'Mixed' batteries and regiments with the ATS supplying two-thirds of their personnel quickly proved a success.Pile's despatch.Collier, Chapter XVII.Routledge, pp. 399–400.Routledge, pp. 338, 407.

Shortly after Operation Overlord was launched on D Day, the Luftwaffe began launching V-1 flying bombs, codenamed 'Divers', against London from Northern France. AA Command had planned for this and Operation Diver was put into effect, with large numbers of AA units moving to South East England. 139th (M) HAA Regiment came under the temporary command of 41 AA Bde, which took over additional responsibilities for units left in the North Midlands until 63 AA Bde HQ returned. The first 'Diver' offensive ended when the launching sites in Normandy were overrun by 21st Army Group. A second campaign of air-launched missiles coming in from the North Sea led to a second redeployment by AA Command to East Anglia, but again 139th (M) HAA Rgt was unaffected by the moves.Collier, Chapter XXIV.Routledge, pp. 407–18, Table LXX, p. 423.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. Brussels 'X' deployment 3.7-inch HAA gun of 484/139 (M) HAA Rgt, Belgium, 11 January 1945. Once 21st Army Group had liberated Brussels and Antwerp, these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within Germany, and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established. The missiles' small size, high speed and awkward height presented a severe problem for AA guns. AA Command's experience had shown that the power-operated, remotely controlled static Mk IIC 3.7-inch HAA gun, which had power traverse and automatic fuze-setting, accompanied by the most sophisticated Radar No 3 Mark V (the SCR-584 radar set) and No 10 Predictor (the all-electric Bell Labs AAA Computer), were required to deal effectively with V-1s, but 21st Army Group's mobile HAA units did not have experience with this equipment. 139th (M) HAA Regiment was the first Mixed unit sent from AA Command to reinforce the Brussels 'X' defences.Routledge, pp. 336–8. The regiment was still deployed around Nottingham in early November 1944 when it was ordered to move overseas at war establishment. This meant leaving behind one battery (518, which became independent) and finding 200 ATS reinforcements to bring the other three up to the required strength. Fortunately there was no shortage of volunteers from other units. The regiment's advance parties arrived in Antwerp on 18 November and spent an uncomfortable week in temporary accommodation under V-1 attack before moving on to Brussels. Here they reconnoitred six new 4-gun sites for occupation by 16 December. These sites lacked all provision for a static HAA gun position: there were no gun platforms, access roads, water supply, drainage or accommodation. The Royal Canadian Engineers erected a few huts for the ATS, while the men slept in tents despite the cold weather. The gun platforms required 2000 tons of rubble to be tipped onto soft ground, with another 800 tons for hardstandings, although the access roads were built as single tracks that were blocked by the gun transporters. On arrival the 15-ton static guns had to be lowered precisely onto holdfasts dug into the ground. All other facilities, including cookhouses and latrines, had to be built from scratch. The Brussels city authorities helped with telephone lines, transport and bathing facilities. Two gun positions were ready for action on 22 December and on 28 December 484 (M) HAA Bty fired its first rounds at incoming missiles. Several other Mixed HAA regiments followed over succeeding weeks.Routledge, p. 338. ATS women of a mixed HAA battery off duty in a Nissen hut, November 1944. The Brussels 'X' defences under 101 AA Brigade involved an outer line of Wireless Observer Units sited to in front of the guns to give 8 minutes' warning, then Local Warning (LW) stations positioned half way, equipped with radar to begin plotting individual missiles. Finally there was an inner belt of Observation Posts (OPs), about in front of the guns to give visual confirmation that the tracked target was a missile. The LW stations and OPs were operated by teams from the AA regiments. Radar-controlled searchlights were deployed to assist in identification and engagement of missiles at night. Unlike the anti-Diver guns firing over the English Channel or North Sea, VT Proximity fuzes could not be employed by the HAA batteries at Brussels because of the risk of casualties to troops and civilians under the missiles' flightpath. The success rate of the Brussels X defences had been low at first, but after the arrival of Mk IIC guns and experienced crews from AA Command the results improved considerably, with best results in February and March 1945. (101 AA Bde handed over command to 50 AA Bde for the last few weeks.) The number of missiles launched at Brussels dropped rapidly as 21st Army Group continued its advance, and in the last week the AA defences destroyed 97.5 per cent of those reaching the defence belt.Routledge, pp. 333–4, 338–41, Map 31. Royal Artillery collar badge By 27 April, 139th (Mixed) HAA Regiment had been stood down,Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. and on 3 May its personnel were back at Ticknall, near Derby, where the regiment and its three batteries were disbanded, five days before the war in Europe ended on VE Day. Insignia While the male members of the regiment wore the Royal Artillery's 'gun' cap badge, the women wore the ATS cap badge, but in addition they wore the RA's 'grenade' collar badge as a special badge above the left breast pocket of the tunic. Both sexes wore the white RA lanyard on the right shoulder.Sainsbury, Plate 9, p. 7.

History PT-20 was commissioned by the United States Navy and laid down on 14 October 1940 at the Elco Works of the Electric Launch Company (now Electric Boat Company) at their Bayonne, New Jersey shipyard; launched on 14 Mar 1941; and completed on 9 June 1941. On 20 June 1941, she was commissioned and attached to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Two (MTBRON 2) under the command of Lt. Comdr. Earl S. Caldwell and assigned to patrol the Panama Canal Zone. On 13 August 1941, she was transferred to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron One (MTBRON 1) under the command of Lt. William C. Specht and assigned to Pearl Harbor. During the attack on Pearl Harbor, PT-20 was moored at berth S-13 awaiting loading on the replenishment oiler USS Ramapo (AO-12) for MTBRON 1's assignment to the Philippines. All 12 boats of the squadron fired on the attacking Japanese aircraft with one, PT-23, credited with shooting down two Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo bombers. In May 1942, the squadron was reassigned to Lt. Clinton McKellar Jr. and tasked with the defense of Midway Island being lead by Marine Corps Colonel Harold D. Shannon. The squadron made the 1,385 mile trip under their own power, then the longest made by PT boats to date refueling at Necker Island, French Frigate Shoals, and Lisianski Island. 11 of the 12 PT boats of MTBRON 1 made it to Midway (PT-23 had broken a crankshaft en route and was forced to return to Pearl Harbor). PT-20 along with PT-21, PT-22, PT-24, PT-25, PT-26, PT-27, PT-28, PT-42 were assigned to Midway Island while PT-29 and PT-30 were assigned to nearby Kure Atoll (55 miles west). During the Battle of Midway, they were tasked with providing anti-aircraft support (PT-21 and PT-22 were credited with downing a Mitsubishi A6M \\"Zero\\" fighter), patrolling the perimeter of the island, and the rescuing of downed pilots. After the battle, the squadron was sent to attack the remainder of the Japanese task force but was unable to locate the target. On 15 July 1942, the squadron returned to Pearl Harbor and then was divided: PT-21, PT-23, PT-25, and PT-26 (along with motor torpedo boat tender ') were deployed to Palmyra Atoll; PT-22, PT-24, PT-27, and PT-28 were deployed to Adak Island in the Aleutians; while PT-20, PT-29, PT-30, and PT-42 remained at Pearl Harbor. On 22 December 1944, PT-20 was struck from the Navy list due to obsolescence. Her fate is unknown.

Mares is a researcher at University College London, a member of the Royal Historical Society, and a research associate at Oxford University. In his most important works, Mares re-examined the subject of The Golden Age of Piracy from the perspective of British colonial and imperial history, introducing a theory of mutual contribution between illicit realm of piracy and legal realm of imperial and colonial administration. Mares also holds a degree in English Literature and Philosophy, exploring writers from the Victorian period through the classical philosophical concepts of Aristotle. In 2016, Mares published a widely-popular article about STAR WARS: The Force Awakens, discussing the movie on the basis of Disney's use of psychological appeal on the principle of nostalgia.  Life and career  Mares was born on July 30, 1987 to a British father and Czech mother. He was educated at Czech gymnasiums and a boarding school in Stowe, Buckinghamshire. He went on to study at Masaryk University, Brno, while spending the academic year 2007 in New York as an exchange student. He completed his Master of Arts (MA) degree in 2013, while he simultaneously undertook Humanities studies at Anglo-American University, graduating in 2015. Between 2013 and 2016, Mares had resided with his wife in New York, where he utilised this opportunity to conduct his further archival research on the history of maritime piracy in Northern America. He then moved to England, where he undertook History & Research program at Birkbeck, University of London. In 2016, he received Andersson Bequest Fund grant for his work on the Golden Age of Piracy. In 2017, he was granted a membership in the Royal Historical Society. In 2018, he joined University College London (UCL) as a doctoral researcher. Mares is also a member of the Society for Nautical Research, a UK-based learned and dining society focused on maritime history and research. Mares also serves as one of the curators and contributors of Ancient History Encyclopedia.  History  Mares' specialization is the early modern period with an expertise in the history of maritime piracy. In 2015, Mares first introduced his theory of 'mutual contribution' in The British Contribution to the Development of Piracy in the Golden Age of Piracy, supporting his secondary argument that the longer periodization of this era should be understood as an uninterrupted and continuous process with its points of peaks and regressions. From the economical perspective, these ideas were later expanded by Nicolás Rodríguez Arosemena. Later, Mares expanded some of his ideas in The Role of Jamaica in Fostering Maritime Piracy In the Atlantic Ocean, 1655-1702, presenting pirates as an integral element of British imperial endeavour by an implementation of a complex framework of relations between influential members involved in Jamaican colonial administration and prominent individuals of pirate crews. Dmitry A. Pautov in an article entitled \\"Pirate republic in the Bahamas: the causes and the impact on the system of government\\" highlighted Mares' interpretation of the 17th/18th centuries piracy as an \\"alternative and free society\\" operating on the peripheries of the normative society and engaging in political experiments oscillating between democracy and anarchy. In his historiographical study, Pautov emphasized the importance of Mares' arguments for the understanding of \\"the Pirate Republic as the unique experience of social and territorial self- organization, leaving a bright mark in the development of not only the colonial system but also in world history, as a whole, becoming yet another evidence of the viability of one or another local alternative political model, without a support of influential geopolitical forces and factors.\\" While Mares' works on piracy have been generally regarded as well-researched and objective, however his rhetorical arguments in favor of British aggressive expansionist policy through piracy have been likened to \\"the rhetoric and the reasoning used by General Zod\\", a fictional Kryptonian archvillain and Superman's main antagonist. In 2018, Mares has published an academic article about James Hunt, one of the understudied British proponents of Victorian scientific racism, presenting Hunt as one of the most influential figures for the later development of racist beliefs. In a publication A reconsideration of James Africanus Beale Horton of Sierra Leone (1835–1883) and his legacy, Odile Georg praised Mares' ability to recognize important nuances in Hunt's everlasting impact on popular British racial discourse in the second half of the 19th century.  Philosophy  In 2014, Mares published his work 'The Art of Creating a Free City: A Philosophical Analysis with Special Focus on Ancient Societies', making the case that modern societies, compared to ancient Greeks, are driven by the dogmatic beliefs in the economics as an ultimate governing force, which separates and fragments the civic society into entrenched groups, crippling the democracy itself. By contrast, Mares uses the examples of Greek city states, agoras and Plato's concept of justice as fairness to propose a different model for thinking about the civic society. In his 2016 scholarly article \\"Kleos, Nostos and Ponos in the Homeric Tradition\\", Mares defended the concept of a traditional heroism against postmodernist critiques, arguing that achieving an eternal glory (kleos) through an ordeal (ponos) with a successful homecoming (nostos) should be viewed as a clear manifestation of one's meaningful existence - imprinting of hero's legacy. Mares illustrated this understanding by using examples of Achilles, Odysseus and Diomedes, presenting them as different avatars of such heroic qualities. Brazilian scholar Flavia R. Monteiro later used Mares' interpretation for her work on tragic heroes in Shakespeare's plays.  Other contributions  Mares has also been active in a number of fields, including popular history, game journalism and pop-culture criticism. Since the late 2000s, Mares has contributed to various historical magazines and periodicals, including Živá Historie (Living History), York Historian, HISTORY Revue, Honey History, LEVEL Magazine, ABC, Excalibur or 'Pevnost'. = Writing = In 2012, Mares had co- authored an illustrated children's book Pirates. = Artwork = Mares is an avid hobbyist painter, working with both traditional and digital mediums, depicting mostly fantasy and nautical motifs. He has illustrated retellings of classic Czech folktales \\"The Old Scratch and His Gambit\\" (2010). Mares also did the watercolour illustrations and pencil sketches for the 2012 Gemini edition of Ancient Greek Myths. = Historical fencing = Mares is a member of a historical European martial arts group Schola Gladiatoria based in London. The fencing school is involved in both theoretical and practical (sparring, drilling) activities. In 2007 Mares joined New York Jedi, a lightsaber academy inspired by Star Wars saga, practicing lightsaber techniques and fighting. Admitted with a rank of \\"Jedi Master\\" and later holding the title \\"Battlemaster\\" (2012), Mares has focused primarily on dueling, utilizing traditional combat forms with single lightsaber and dual lightsabers.https://newyorkjedi.com/about-ny-jedi/  Public image  In December 2015, Mares was listed on the \\"Top 30-Handsome Academics\\" list, featuring international selection of scholars. Since 2013, Mares has regularly attended the St. Luke Fundraiser for Haiti, an annual charity evening organized by fashion designer Kenneth Cole and Brazilian model Adriana Lima, taking place in New York. Mares is known for his support of several African wildlife protection and conservation organisations, including David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, an orphanage for elephants based in Kenya. Mares' frequent travels to Africa led him to join a group of academics, supporting the preservation of dying African Yaaku language. In 2019, Mares took a part in Emilia Clarke's SameYou charity campaign, participating in the Great North Run, the annual half marathon taking place in Newcastle. Since 2019 Mares has contributed to Five Books, a project for sharing lists of five book recommendations by experts. Mares has been generally supportive of \\"more balanced scholarship\\", compiling a list entitled Great Books on Maritime History by Female Writers. According to Mares, the list \\"should shed more light on high-quality female contribution to this subject\\" because this discipline \\"has been predominantly shaped by male scholars and authors.\\" According to LittleSis, a watchdog database of who-knows-who at the heights of business and government, Martin Mares has been linked through social ties to the persons from the high-management of Atlas Merchant Capital and Cambridge Analytica. Despite these social connections, no professional or ethical conflict of interest has been suggested so far as Mares' only publication concerning Brexit \\"The City of London and Brexit\\" shows no signs of the use of mass data collecting in Mares' employed research methods or bias argumentation. Concerning Cambridge Analytica interlocks, Mares also holds membership in Historic Royal Palaces, an independent charity that manages some of the United Kingdom's unoccupied royal palaces, which had received 60,000 USD grant money in 2014 from Mercer Family Foundation, a philanthropic organization founded by Robert Mercer, a founder of Cambridge Analytica.https://pdf.guidestar.org/PDF_Images/2014/201/982/2014-201982204-0c290f3a-F.pdf  Media & TV  In 2017, Mares served as an editor and consultant for the National Geographic documentary Drain the Sunken Pirate City, focusing on the history and maritime archeology of Port Royal, Jamaica.  Technology  Martin Mares and mathematician Christopher Kasso have registered several bionic and artificial intelligence patents, leading up to several prototypes of bionic prosthetics. The bionic hands with artificial intelligence has been experimentally tested with patients since 2015.

This article outlines the history of children's television programming on Telemundo including the various blocks and notable programs that have aired throughout the television network's history.  History  = Nickelodeon en Telemundo (1998–2001) = On September 15, 1998, Telemundo entered into a programming agreement with Nickelodeon to carry the cable channel's programming as part of a morning children's program block, \\"Nickelodeon en Telemundo\\" (\\"Nickelodeon on Telemundo\\"). The block, which debuted on November 9, 1998 and was considered a sub-block of Telemundo Infantil, consisted of Spanish dubs of Nickelodeon's animated series aimed at older children and preschool-oriented programs aired by the channel's Nick Jr. block (such as Rugrats, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, Hey Arnold!, Rocko's Modern Life and Blue's Clues). The block ran on weekday mornings until September 5, 2000, when it was relegated to Saturday and Sunday mornings in order to make room for Hoy En El Mundo (lit. \\"Today in the World\\" or \\"In the World Today\\"). Nickelodeon's contract with Telemundo ended in November 2001, following the network's acquisition by NBC; Hey Arnold! continued to be aired sporadically for a few years afterward. = Telemundo Kids (2005–2006) = On September 17, 2005, Telemundo launched a weekend morning block that turned out to be a revival of the \\"Telemundo Kids” block, but branded differently. The block consisted of Spanish dubs of various Nickelodeon and Canadian shows including All Grown Up, Wimzie's House, Hey Arnold!, Dora the Explorer and Jacob Two- Two. Following the sale of Telemundo to NBC in 2001 and the CBS/Viacom split in early 2006, the block was discontinued September 2, 2006. However, Jacob Two-Two carried over to the block’s direct successor Qubo, which premiered the following week. = Qubo on NBC/Telemundo (2006–2012) = In May 2006, NBC Universal and Ion Media Networks announced plans to form Qubo, a joint venture in conjunction with Scholastic Corporation, Classic Media and Corus Entertainment subsidiary Nelvana. The multi-platform programming endeavor, aimed at children between 4 and 8 years of age, would comprise children's program blocks airing on NBC, Spanish-language sister network Telemundo and Ion Media's i: Independent Television (now Ion Television), as well as a 24-hour digital multicast channel on i's owned-and-operated stations (alternatively known as Qubo Channel), video on demand services and a branded website. The reasoning why the name \\"qubo\\" was chosen for the endeavor, or why its logo is a cube, has not been publicly explained by any of the partners, although general manager Rick Rodriguez stated in an interview with Multichannel News that the name was intended to be something that sounded fun, and be a brand that could easily be uniformally used in English and Spanish. = MiTelemundo (2012–2017) = On March 28, 2012, NBC announced that the three-hour children's programming time period allocated by the network on Saturday mornings would be taken over by Sprout (which had become a sister television property to NBC following parent company NBC Universal's 2010 majority purchase by Comcast; NBC later took full ownership of the network, whose owners previously included Sesame Workshop and HIT Entertainment) and launch a new Saturday morning block called NBC Kids, which is aimed at preschoolers and grade school-aged children ages 2 to 9. Sprout also produced a Spanish-language sister block for Telemundo known as MiTelemundo. NBC Kids debuted on July 7, 2012, one week after the Qubo block ended its run on both NBC and Telemundo on June 30 (leaving Ion Television as the only network to retain a Qubo-branded children's block, as Ion Media Networks is now sole owner of the Qubo properties including the flagship Qubo Channel television service). = MiTelemundo (Litton Entertainment) (2018–present) = On February 24, 2016 and March 1, 2016, NBC and Telemundo announced that it would lease its Saturday morning lineup to Litton Entertainment, The More You Know beginning October 2016 on NBC and January 2018 on Telemundo. Named after NBC's series of public service campaigns, the three-hour Saturday morning block is programmed by Litton Entertainment, and features live-action programming aimed at teens, all of which is dubbed in Spanish. Despite the change of programming, it did not change the name of the block, which remains as MiTelemundo.

She is best known for singing at the Metropolitan Opera House from 1923 to 1932 and as one of the first American singers to establish operatic career without studying in Europe. She produced music for the Girls Scouts of America.  Life  Nanette Guilford, named at birth Nanette Gutman, was born in Harlem, New York on 17 August 1903. She was singing musical comedies at the age of 13 and at 18. She studied privately with Albert Jeannote and in 1921 started her musical theater career in a musical The Midnignt Rounders of 1921 at the Century Promenade theater. In 1928 Guilford married Max Rosen, who was a recognized concert violinist of the first rank. The couple knew each other for three years before marriage and were engaged for six months keeping secret the news of the engagement to escape publicity. Guilford and Rosen made recordings together. The marriage was over after fifteen months, in 1930 when Guilford filled the suit for divorce on the grounds of incompatibility of temperament. Nanette Guilford died of an intestinal infection on 17 March 1990 at St. Vincent Hospital in New York City. She was 86 years old.  Career  = Metropolitan Opera = In May 1923 Guilford signed her first contract with the Metropolitan Opera. Her debut was in a minor role in Rigoletto. She sang small roles until March 1926, when she appeared as Ginerva in La Cena Delle Beffe by Umberto Giordano. Other sources claim that her first prima donna role was in Giordano’s The Jest, after which she was known as the “baby star” of the Met. Guilford was called “the baby star” because when signing her first contract with the Metropolitan Opera, she wrote that she was 18 years old. Among her other roles at the Met are Aida, Liu in Turandot and Musetta in La Boheme. The audience greeted cordially her scenes with Gigli, Tibbett, Miss Dalossy and the others heard previously.

A musical romance Caviar opened on 7 June 1934 and was on at Forest Theatre till 23 June. Guilford sang in Caviar the principal role of Elena, who wanted to marry a Russian prince solely because of his title, but finally felt in love with him. Caviar, that managed less than three weeks in Broadway, despite of strong voice of Metropolitan soprano Nanette Guilford was received by critics as a quick failure. = Nanette Guilford Corporation = In 1960s Nanette Guilford produced music under the label “Nanette Guiford Corporation”.

It is the second of four novels featuring the Prizzis, a powerful family of Mafiosi in New York City. In all four novels the main protagonist is a top member of the family named Charley Partanna. It is a prequelNew York Times interview with Richard Condon prior to the publication of Prizzi's Family at to the very successful Prizzi's Honor of 1982, which was also adapted into an award-winning film. Plot summary The time is 1969, about ten years before the events of Prizzi's Honor. Charley Panaretta, the top hitman for Don Carraro's family, meets an enormous, but very beautiful blonde dancer in one of the Family's nightclubs. She calls herself Mardell La Tour and says that she is English and is partially guided through life by radio waves emanating from Buckingham Palace. The tough but gullible Charley is ignorant enough to believe her. Actually she Grace Willand Crowell, daughter of an immensely wealthy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs whose family lives in Georgetown. To help a friend of hers who is striving for a master's degree in sociology, Mardell, an aspiring actress, has assumed a number of off-beat real-life identities in the last year in order to provide insights about different levels of society for her friend. Her latest role is that of a naive showgirl trying to get established in nightclubs. At the same time that Charley begins a highly emotional but also sexual affair with Mardell, Maerose Prizzi, a granddaughter of the powerful Don, has been mapping out her future career in which she aims to become the first female Don of a family. A key element in her plans, for both tactical and strategic reasons, is marriage to Charley. She soon begins a sexual affair with the hapless Charley, who is now buffeted between the increasingly strident emotional demands of the two women—as well as carrying out his primary duties, that of eliminating various people across the United States seen as threats to various high-ranking members of the Prizzi family. Events come to a surreal semi-climax at an enormous engagement party that Don Carraro has organized for Maerose and Charley—to the stupefaction of her family, Maerose becomes embarrassingly drunk and runs off to Mexico City with one of the male guests. After that, it only remains for Charley to carry out another multiple homicide for the family, to bring back four thumbs to the Don, and to allow Mardell to withdraw herself from his life. Condon's style Condon attacked his targets, usually gangsters, financiers, and politicians, wholeheartedly but with a uniquely original style and wit that made almost any paragraph from one of his books instantly recognizable. Reviewing one of his works in the International Herald Tribune, the well-known playwright George Axelrod (The Seven-Year Itch, Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter), who had collaborated with Condon on the screenplay for the film adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate, wrote: > \\"The arrival of a new novel by Richard Condon is like an invitation to a > party.... the sheer gusto of the prose, the madness of his similies, the > lunacy of his metaphors, his infectious, almost child-like joy in composing > complex sentences that go bang at the end in the manner of exploding cigars > is both exhilarating and as exhausting as any good party ought to be.\\" In Prizzi's Honor, Condon's normal exuberance was somewhat curbed by choosing to narrate the events through the viewpoints of its various semi-literate gangsters, which limited the scope of his imagery. In Family, however, he returns to being his usual omniscient narrator and we have: A description of Maerose's father, Vincent Prizzi, son of the Don, and Boss of the family: \\"Vincent conspired with his own ignorance. He was a perpetually baffled man who chewed on pieces of himself and then spat them out at the world.\\" The Don makes a speech to an enormous family gathering: \\"The way he did this was whisper into Vincent's ear in Sicilian, then Vincent spoke it into the microphone in Brooklynese, dumping the words out of the depths of his stomach the way a piled wheelbarrow is emptied by upending it.\\" Charley makes love for the first time with Maerose: \\"It was like being locked in a mailbag with eleven boa constrictors.\\" Real-life names in the book All of Condon's books have, to an unknown degree, the names of real people in them as characters, generally very minor or peripheral. The most common, which appears in most of his books, is some variation of Franklin M. Heller. The real-life Heller was a television director in New York City in the 1950s, '60s, and 70s, who initially lived on Long Island and then moved to a house on Rockrimmon Road in Stamford, Connecticut.Remembrance of Frank Heller, by Ira Skutch, at In this book Franklin Heller is the mayor of New York. A.H. Weiler, a film critic for The New York Times, was another friend of Condon's who in this book is Dr. Abraham Weiler, the best orthopedic surgeon in the Northwest. Reception Publishers Weekly liked it: > Obsessed with Mardell yet pulled by loyalty and lust to Maerose, Charley is > trapped between them, all the while carrying out his regular duties as the > Prizzi enforcer. Condon serves up this zesty mix with good humor, broadside > slams at politicians and evangelism, and generous helpings of Sicilian > food.Publishers Weekly, October 1, 1986, at Kirkus Reviews had mixed feelings about it: > ...the sketches of Mafia viciousness and hypocrisy are often deliciously > mordant; and, with those movie characterizations to bolster Charley and > Maerose in the reader's mind, there's enough dark whimsy and oafish pathos > here to provide earthy, quirky, fast-moving entertainment.Kirkus Review, > September 23, 1986, at Jimmie Breslin, however, in The New York Times, definitely did not like it: > At first the prequel seemed to be satire and then appeared to be heading > toward spoof.

The plebiscite was held on February 22, 2001, and the results were announced on February 26, 2001. The plebiscite was supervised and officiated by the COMELEC pursuant to Resolution No. 3577. Background Attempts to create a new province from Zamboanga del Sur date as far back as the 1960s. Several bills were filed in the Philippine Congress, but remained unacted until the start of the 2000s. The creation of a province named Zamboanga Sibugay was proposed by George Hofer, former Zamboanga del Sur congressman. The proposed province was to compose all municipalities of Zamboanga del Sur under the 3rd legislative district at that time. Republic Act No. 8973, a law proposed by Congressman Hofer, was signed into law by President Joseph Estrada and was enacted on November 7, 2000. Because of this, the province is the newest in the country, carved out from the western part of Zamboanga del Sur. A plebiscite was held on February 22, 2001, to ratify the law. A majority vote of those who participated in the plebiscite was required to approve or disapprove of the creation of Zamboanga del Sur. Registered voters of Zamboanga del Sur and Pagadian City at the time of the plebiscite were eligible to vote. The results of the plebiscite were announced by the COMELEC on February 26, 2001. 70 percent of those who voted favored the creation of the new province. Aftermath Pursuant to Republic Act No. 8973, Ipil was designated as the capital of the new province.

It encompasses the building of the Bourse of Antwerp, which has been described as \\"the mother of all stock exchanges\\". From 1531 to 1661 it was the site of the world's first dedicated commodity exchange, and after extensive renovations it housed the Antwerp stock exchange from 1872 until 1997. After the 1997 merger of the Antwerp stock exchange with the Brussels stock exchange, and the advent of online trading, the exchange building in Antwerp fell into disuse, with various proposals to redevelop the building going nowhere for fifteen years.

It was organised as the first 'Mixed' regiment in which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated into the unit's personnel, though it later reverted to an all-male organisation. It defended the United Kingdom against aerial attack for two years. Organisation Auxiliary Territorial Service cap badge By 1941, after two years of war Anti-Aircraft Command, tasked with defending the UK against air attack, was suffering a manpower shortage. In April its commander-in- chief, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile, proposed to overcome this by utilising the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The ATS was by law a non-combatant service, but it was decided that Defence Regulations permitted the employment of women in anti-aircraft (AA) roles other than actually firing the guns. They worked the radar and plotting instruments, range-finders and predictors, ran command posts and communications, and carried out many other duties. With the increasing automation of heavy AA (HAA) guns, including gun-laying, fuze-setting and ammunition loading under remote control from the predictor, the question of who actually fired the gun became blurred as the war progressed. The ATS rank and file, if not always their officers, took to the new role with enthusiasm and 'Mixed' batteries and regiments with the ATS supplying two-thirds of their personnel quickly proved a success.Pile's despatch.Collier, Chapter XVII.Routledge, pp. 399–400.Routledge, p. 338. 3.7-inch HAA gun battery, December 1942, wearing the 1st AA Division shoulder patch. The first of these new batteries took over an operational gun site in Richmond Park, south-west London, in August 1941, and the first full regiment of converted batteries soon followed: 131st (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, whose regimental headquarters (RHQ) formed at Bitterne, near Southampton, on 25 August. On 4 September it was joined by three existing HAA batteries that had been converted to the Mixed organisation:Frederick, pp. 756–7, 785. * 251 (Buckinghamshire) HAA Bty from 80th (Berkshire) HAA Rgt – left on 7 October and reverted to all-male organisation; later served in West AfricaJoslen, p. 490. * 310 (M) HAA Bty, from 72nd (Hampshire) HAA Rgt * 368 (M) HAA Bty, from 116th HAA Rgt Following the departure of 251 HAA Bty, 458 HAA Bty (an unmixed unit) joined on 28 October 1941. It served with the regiment until 2 April 1942 when it was reduced to a cadre to form the basis of a mixed battery at 205th HAA Training Rgt, Arborfield, but once it had completed conversion 458 (M) HAA Bty did not return to the regiment and instead joined a new 160th (M) HAA Rgt forming at Fort Fareham, Hampshire. 428 HAA Battery, also all-male, joined 131st (M) HAA Rgt from 54th (City of London) HAA Rgt on 29 December 1941.Frederick, pp. 759, 791.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81. 131st HAA Regiment supplied a cadre to 207th HAA Training Rgt at Devizes as the basis of a new 520 (M) HAA Bty formed on 15 January 1942; this joined 152nd (M) HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 760.

After formation, 131st (M) HAA Rgt was assigned to 35th Anti-Aircraft Brigade, part of 5th Anti-Aircraft Division tasked with defending Southampton and Portsmouth. However, 310 and 368 (M) HAA Btys came under the control of 8th Anti-Aircraft Division defending the area west of Southampton. In late 1941 and early 1942 RHQ only had 428 and 458 HAA Btys under its direct command, and lost its 'Mixed' designation. The Blitz had ended in May 1941 and there were fewer air raids thereafter. Even during the Baedeker Blitz of 1942, the Luftwaffe avoided heavily defended targets such as Portsmouth and Southampton. Southampton was raided on 17 April and 21 June, Portsmouth on 20 August.Collier, Appendix XXXVIII. After 458 HAA Bty left for conversion, and 428 Bty came under the control of 72nd (Hampshire) HAA Rgt, RHQ had no batteries under its direct command until it was joined on 10 July 1942 by another all-male battery, 376 HAA Bty from 97th (London Scottish) HAA Rgt. The regiment and its four batteries (310, 368, 376, and 428), now all-male, left for 37 AA Bde in 6th Anti-Aircraft Division in July 1942. 37 AA Brigade operated the 'Thames North' AA layout in Essex, a key part of the AA defences of London against raiders flying up the Thames Estuary; 376 HAA Bty was under the operational command of 71 AA Bde, which was newly forming in 6 AA Division. However, this deployment did not last long, and in August 1942 the regiment moved again, to 70 AA Bde in 4th Anti-Aircraft Division in North West England, with 376 and 428 HAA Btys attached to 33 (Western) AA Bde in Liverpool, 376 later coming under 44 AA Bde at Manchester.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82. Brass collar badge of the Royal Artillery In October 1942, 4th AA Division had been replaced by 4 AA Group and by March 1943 the regiment had moved to 53 AA Bde within that group. North West England was hardly threatened by the Luftwaffe by this stage of the war, and AA Command began redeploying its inadequate manpower to other sectors. First 310 and then 428 HAA Btys were attached for a time to 5 AA Group in North East England and then on 3 August 1943 the regiment began to disperse. The four batteries became independent on 6 August and RHQ completed its disbandment by 31 August.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83.

Originally laid out as St. James Square in 1848, local newspapers dubbed the site a park in 1885, shortly after a fountain was installed in the center of the area. St. James Park was the site of a notorious lynching in 1933 of the two who were accused of kidnapping and murdering Brooke Hart. Since then, the park has been bisected by a road and light rail tracks; it is now a focus of the homeless population of San Jose. History St. James Square was mapped in 1848 as part of the official survey of the city by Charles Lyman, but not further developed until after Trinity Episcopal Church was erected next to the square in 1863; the Square was developed in the late 1860s, starting with a fence erected in 1866. William O'Donnell landscaped the park under contract to the city of San Jose. It was one of three public squares in San Jose at the time, alongside Washington Square (site of present-day San Jose State) and Market Plaza (now Plaza de César Chávez); O'Donnell was responsible for all three. Under O'Donnell's plan, the landscaping effort was in planting hundreds of trees to provide shade, a rarity in downtown San Jose at the time. At the time, no paths were known to exist, based on the earliest photograph of the park, dating to 1870. Although oral histories indicate that Frederick Law Olmsted was involved in the initial design of the park, his formal participation has not been confirmed. A hole deep was dug to provide a city well, but without success, and the effort was abandoned in 1879. One of the first major features was a fountain at the park's center; it was built in 1885 and the area began to be called St. James Park instead of St. James Square at about this time. According to contemporary photographs, the fountain contained a standing female figure, with water spilling from an urn held over the statue's head. The fence was removed in 1886. In 1887, Rudolph Ulrich was given a contract to re-landscape all three public squares. Simultaneously, local merchants advocated for an extension of North Second Street through the park. Ulrich is credited with adding rows of palm trees along North First and Third streets to provide a more formal border between the park and encroaching downtown businesses. By 1891, formal diagonal and curvilinear paths had been laid through the park, according to contemporary photographs and that year's Sanborn Fire Insurance Map. President William McKinley visited San Jose on May 13, 1901 en route to San Francisco; plans for his welcome included a giant bouquet of cut flowers tall and in circumference at the western entrance to St. James Park, billed as the largest bouquet ever made. After his assassination in September 1901, citizens of San Jose held a memorial service at St. James Park and began planning a permanent monument. The McKinley Memorial dates back to 1903. The William McKinley statue was placed on its base in December 1902. On February 21, 1903, the statue was unveiled on the site where the president had spoken to the public during his visit to the city in May 1901. The standing bronze sculpture, mounted on a granite pedestal, was executed by Rupert Schmid at a cost of , paid through private donations. A brass cannon is at the foot of the McKinley monument; it has been the site of vigilante justice, including a 1918 incident in which George Koetzer, a brewery employee, was accused of making pro-German remarks, for which he was tarred and feathered, then chained to the cannon. The city made its first drawing of the park in 1920, showing an overhead view of the park's layout. Diagonal paths connect the corners of the park with the central fountain plaza; additional paths cutting east-west and north-south through the center of the park are also present, along with a meandering path connecting all four corners slightly in from the park's perimeter. The 1885 fountain was demolished in a remodel that occurred under a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project to renovate the park in the 1930s. Various WPA projects brought a new post office to the park's western edge and restrooms at the northern and southern ends of the park; the restrooms were removed in the 1950s. During the construction of the post office, Harold Thurmond and John Holmes were lynched in St. James Park for the kidnapping and murder of Brooke Hart in November 1933. Construction materials from the post office were used to storm the city jail where the men were being held; the trees in the park from which the men were hanged (not far from the McKinley memorial) were removed shortly afterward to deter souvenir-seekers. Other memorials within St. James Park honor Henry Morris Naglee (erected 1915 by his daughters) and Robert F. Kennedy (1970). Kennedy had spoken at St. James Park on March 23, 1968 while running for president; he was assassinated later that year. In 1994, the Memorial Bell for San Jose firefighters was moved to the park from Plaza de César Chávez; it was subsequently relocated to Old Fire Station 1 in 2001. Voters narrowly passed an initiative to extend North Second Street through the center of the park in 1952 to accommodate increased traffic, and the extension was completed in 1955, bisecting it; a later proposal to remove North Second in 1976 failed. A senior center was constructed in 1973 in the northeast quadrant of the park, using modular structures that were intended to be temporary. The St. James Square Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 27, 1979. It encompasses the original St. James Square (now St. James Park) along with several bordering properties. A replacement fountain was constructed between 1988 and 1990 in the western half of the park, but is presently not functioning. The 1990 fountain is meant to evoke the 1885 fountain but not replicate it. Location Trinity Episcopal Church, 81 N 2nd St. James Park is bounded by East St. James Street (on the north), North Third St (on the east), East St. John St (on the south), and North First St (on the west); it is divided into western and eastern halves by North Second Street. As originally laid out, it measured (east-west between North First and North Third) and (north-south from East St James to East St John). It is served by the Saint James Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority light rail stop; northbound trains stop along the western edge, along North First, and southbound trains stop in the center of the park, along North Second. The light rail lines were completed in 1988. =St. James Square Historic District= The St. James Square Historic District established in 1979 consisted of St. James Park along with nine contributing properties surrounding it. One of the properties listed as contributing to the Historic District, the Clarence Letcher Garage or Four- Wheel Brake Building at the corner of N 1st and St James, most recently housed the Oasis nightclub until it was shut down in 1996 following the beating death of Jason Cooper; the building was demolished in 2010. Clarence Letcher was a prominent San Jose automobile dealer who was shot and killed by his wife in a murder-suicide that occurred at the Garage on July 3, 1926. {class =\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=font-size:85%;text-align:center; +St. James Square Historic District - !

Inside is a handcuffed corpse; the ex-lover of the dead man was the son of a serving detective inspector in what was the old Lothian & Borders Police Force of Rebus' day before it became Police Scotland. As ever, Rebus and also 'Big Ger' Cafferty, are connected to the case and end up featuring prominently in the investigation, in which Detective Inspector Siobhan Clarke is also a major player. Rebus is suffering from COPD and has given up cigarettes and almost stopped drinking alcohol.

He died of axe wounds to his head in a pub car park in Sydenham, South London in 1987. He was investigating alleged police corruption at the time. Critical reception Reception to the book was largely positive; Barry Forshaw, writing in The Guardian said \\"How has Rankin kept the series fresh for 22 novels? Deft characterisation.

It was written by executive producer Victor Levin and directed by Gordon Hunt. The episode originally aired on December 16, 1997, on NBC. The plot sees married couple Paul (Paul Reiser) and Jamie Buchman (Helen Hunt) have a 20-minute conversation in front of their bedroom door, as they allow their infant daughter Mabel to cry herself to sleep for the first time. \\"The Conversation\\" is a bottle episode that was filmed in one take with a single camera. Playing out in real time, it takes place almost entirely outside the Buchman's bedroom. The episode was originally broadcast uninterrupted by commercials, which only aired after the opening theme and just before the end credits. Levin was inspired to write the episode around Ferberization as he believed that it had \\"strong emotional ground\\". He also wanted an episode that would showcase Reiser and Hunt, who had always wanted to try the bottle episode format. The episode was seen by 17.9 million viewers, giving the show its largest audience since the sixth-season premiere. It received a mixed reaction following its broadcast, with critics praising Reiser and Hunt's performances, and the honest and funny script. However, one critic called it the \\"most annoying Mad About You episode ever\\". In later years it has been named one of television's best bottle episodes. Plot Jamie and Paul Buchman put their infant daughter Mabel to bed, and wait outside the bedroom door to see if she will go to sleep on her own. Jamie sets a timer for intervals that allow them to check on Mabel, but they can only comfort her verbally. Paul is unhappy with the method, as he wants to go in and hold Mabel, but Jamie insists that it will be good for her in the end, and stops him from going into the room early. As they wait outside the door, Paul and Jamie talk about various topics, including Jamie winning 500 pounds of rigatoni, Paul's concern that he is shrinking and his sudden realization that they have a cabinet by the room. When Jamie discovers their dog Murray is in the bedroom, Paul has to crawl in and get Murray out. Paul picks up a magazine featuring a sales listing for a house, and he admits that he wants to move to the suburbs. Paul and Jamie argue over city and suburban living, causing Jamie to remark that they are completely incompatible as parents, as they disagree on almost everything. Jamie feels sick and Paul helps her to realize that her gut instinct is telling her to pick up Mabel. However, just before they go in, they hear that Mabel has finally fallen asleep. Jamie tells Paul that they broke Mabel's heart because she knows that they will not always be there for her. Paul stops Jamie from going inside, as he worries that they will wake her. Jamie then tells him to turn back the clock and they stay outside the door. They later watch a film together and Paul points out the scene is all one-shot, but Jamie is not impressed. Production =Conception and writing= The sitcom's executive producer Victor Levin wrote the script. He believed an episode focusing on Ferberization, a technique that allows a child to cry itself to sleep, would have \\"strong emotional ground\\". Levin spoke with the writing staff and the actors about his idea of Paul and Jamie being unable to leave the doorway to their bedroom, as they listen to their daughter's cries. He explained to Nancy McAlister of The Florida Times Union: \\"What would be the surprises that would be unearthed if two people sat down just to talk since they've had a kid? Maybe they've been so busy they haven't had time to have a substantive talk. What do you think would come out?\\" Levin felt the plot would also showcase Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt's talents. He also hoped the episode would resonate with parents and elicit empathy from the rest of the audience, saying \\"I hope that they feel that it's real and honest and funny.\\" Reiser told The Records Virginia Rohan that all parents go through a version of Ferberization at some point. As the episode plays out, Paul and Jamie come to realize that they have very different parenting styles. They argue and converse, which brings up \\"surprising revelations\\", including Paul's views on where they raise their daughter. Reiser said that the bottle episode format was something the show had always wanted to try, following a season one episode set in the bathroom. He commented, \\"if the story is compelling enough, you could put an entire episode in an elevator.\\" They were unable to find such a story until the sixth season. Levin also stated that Mad About You had plans for an experimental episode before medical drama ER aired its live episode that same year. He told McAlister that the format was the right way for the story to be told and that it was not a stunt. =Filming and broadcast= Hunt's father Gordon Hunt directed \\"The Conversation\\". In preparation for filming, the cast and crew had to know the exact length of the script, so they would not run over the time or run too short. Levin told McAlister that the script was \\"accurately timed out\\", so they knew how long the lines took to say. Rehearsals did not differ from regular episodes, but there were two \\"practice runs\\" during the afternoon of the shoot. The episode was filmed with a single camera in one take, so that it plays out in real time. Reiser confirmed that the episode took 25 minutes to film compared with the usual three hours. The episode was filmed twice with and without a live studio audience. The take with the audience was the version that was broadcast. Levin confirmed that the audience had a positive reaction to the script and jokes, saying \\"I think they felt they were part of something unusual.\\" At one point, Paul and Jamie realize their dog Murray is in the bedroom with Mabel and Paul has to crawl in to get Murray out. Reiser was surprised by the dog's timing and he was appreciative that the scene went well, saying \\"we were working on our lines, and he was working on his little belly crawl.\\" \\"The Conversation\\" was originally broadcast without interruption from commercials, which were aired at the beginning after the theme song and just before the credits. Levin expressed his gratitude to the NBC network for helping out with the process. He also revealed that the lack of commercials impacted the writing, and he made sure that, despite being one scene, the episode had a beginning, middle and end. He told McAlister that he wanted it to be \\"as impactful and big feeling\\" as any show with multiple scenes. In the episode's tag, Paul and Jamie are shown watching a film in a similar style to the episode, and Jamie expresses her dislike of the one-take approach. Reception =Ratings= In its original broadcast, \\"The Conversation\\" finished 12th in the ratings for the week of December 15–21, 1997. It was seen by 17.9 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, giving Mad About You its largest audience since the sixth-season premiere in September. It was the seventh highest-rated show on NBC that week, following episodes of ER, Seinfeld, Veronica's Closet, Friends, Union Square and Frasier. =Critical response= Writing for The Akron Beacon Journal, James Endrst thought \\"The Conversation\\" was \\"in its own quiet way, a greater success\\" compared to the live ER episode. Endrst praised Reiser and Hunt for their \\"touching and, under the TV circumstances, nearly flawless performances\\", and the script for creating distinctive and honest moments. He concluded that it was not a groundbreaking episode, but special. Walt Belcher from The Tampa Tribune said Mad About You succeeded with the one- take format, because it did not \\"overpower\\" the plot or performances, unlike experimental episodes of ER and Chicago Hope. David Bianculli of the New York Daily News was impressed that the episode was filmed in one take and that Gordon Hunt directed it \\"without a false note\\". Bianculli felt the episode, despite its \\"strong\\" script, would \\"sink, rather than soar\\" if it was not for Reiser and Hunt. He also joked that the episode featured more non-stop crying since the broadcast of telemovie The Women's Room. In his review, The Capital's John Martin called the episode \\"inspired\\". He wrote, \\"funny and heartwarming, it touches the uncertainties all good parents face.\\" Martin also attributed \\"outstanding performances\\" by Reiser and Hunt for making the episode so memorable. In contrast, The Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik found that 22 minutes of a crying baby was \\"way too much\\", and he believed that \\"The Conversation\\" was a good example of how \\"baby-obsessed\\" the sitcom had become. Zurawik also reported that USA Today gave the episode a thumbs-down and stated that Mabel was the \\"most ill-conceived television baby since Murphy Brown's controversial Avery.\\" Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press branded \\"The Conversation\\" the \\"most annoying Mad About You episode ever\\". He added that commercials would have been a welcome interruption. A reporter for The Desert Sun had a mixed reaction, saying it was \\"a sweet episode that's a little slack in the middle, but ends quite poignantly.\\" Diane Shipley from British newspaper The Guardian thought the plot was \\"ill-conceived\\" but the filming format \\"was an impressive acting achievement, but one that replicated the noise and tedium of early parenthood far too effectively.\\" =Impact and legacy= In 2013, Jennifer Wood of Mental Floss included \\"The Conversation\\" in her feature on the \\"10 Best Bottle Episodes of Your Favorite TV Shows\\". Wood wrote that \\"director Gordon Hunt channeled his inner Ingmar Bergman to do the unthinkable: drop a camera on the floor of the Buchmans' apartment and leave it there. For the entire show. Whether the actors were in the shot or not.\\" She called it \\"pretty revolutionary stuff\\" and said the tag was \\"a clever nod\\" to the format. Kaitlynn Smith from TV Fanatic also included the episode in her feature on \\"Amazing Bottle Episodes\\", calling it \\"one of the most challenging and well-executed\\" of the format. Vultures Daniel Kurland named \\"The Conversation\\" as \\"one of the boldest bottle episodes ever\\". He found the idea to be ambitious, and thought the subject matter would resonate with parents going through the same thing with their children. He also said it was \\"a showcase of Paul and Jamie as unconfident new parents, and it encapsulates this beautifully.\\" Kurland acknowledged that it is an unpopular episode with some viewers, but wrote \\"it might not be a perfect experiment, but it's a sort of brilliant, evolving idea.\\" Actress Natalie Morales chose \\"The Conversation\\" as her most influential television episode in a feature for Decider. Morales explained that upon her first viewing, she was unable to look away as she realized that it was all one take, making it \\"so starkly dissimilar from any other thing on TV.\\" She went onto say that the episode influenced her to think about breaking the mold and \\"the different ways I could do things that were already established as, 'Well, this is just how it's done.

It was one of the first 'Mixed' regiments in which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated into the unit's personnel. It defended London and South-East England against aerial attack until it deployed to Belgium in January 1945 to defend Brussels against V-1 flying bombs. Organisation Auxiliary Territorial Service cap badge By 1941, after two years of war Anti-Aircraft Command, tasked with defending the UK against air attack, was suffering a manpower shortage. In April its commander-in-chief, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile, proposed to overcome this by utilising the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). The ATS was by law a non-combatant service, but it was decided that Defence Regulations permitted the employment of women in anti-aircraft (AA) roles other than actually firing the guns. They worked the radar and plotting instruments, range-finders and predictors, ran command posts and communications, and carried out many other duties. With the increasing automation of heavy AA (HAA) guns, including gun-laying, fuze- setting and ammunition loading under remote control from the predictor, the question of who actually fired the gun became blurred as the war progressed. The ATS rank and file, if not always their officers, took to the new role with enthusiasm and 'Mixed' batteries and regiments with the ATS supplying two- thirds of their personnel quickly proved a success.Pile's despatch.Collier, Chapter XVII.Routledge, pp. 399–400.Routledge, pp. 338, 407. An ATS member of a mixed 3.7-inch HAA gun battery, December 1942, wearing the 1st AA Division shoulder patch. The first of these new units, 435 (Mixed) HAA Battery, took over an operational gun site in Richmond Park, south-west London, in August 1941, and a full regiment of converted batteries soon followed. The next group of mixed regiments was formed on 22 September 1941, including 132nd (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, whose regimental headquarters formed in Highgate, North London. It was then joined by the following batteries:Frederick, pp. 758–61, 785. * 435 (M) HAA Bty (the original mixed battery) joined from 105th HAA Rgt on 6 October 1941 * 450 (M) HAA Bty, formed on 10 July 1941 at 205th HAA Training Rgt, Arborfield, from a cadre of experienced officers and gunners supplied by 105th HAA Rgt, became mixed on 13 August and was regimented with 132nd HAA Rgt on 6 October * 457 (M) HAA Bty, formed on 10 July 1941 at 206th HAA Training Rgt, Arborfield, from a cadre supplied by 77th (Welsh) HAA Rgt, became mixed on 27 August and was regimented with 132nd HAA Rgt on 3 November * 469 (M) HAA Bty, formed on 7 August 1941 at 206th HAA Training Rgt from a cadre supplied by 113th HAA Rgt, became mixed on 24 September and was regimented with 132nd HAA Rgt on 24 November Deployment Formation sign of 1st AA Division. The new regiment was assigned to 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, part of 1st Anti-Aircraft Division operating the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ) of defences.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/80. 553 (M) HAA Battery, formed on 16 April 1942 at Arborfield by 205th HAA Training Rgt from another cadre supplied by 105th HAA Rgt, was due to have been regimented with 132nd HAA Rgt by 26 June, but there was a shortage of ATS recruits and its formation was delayed. It eventually joined 163rd (M) HAA Rgt. 132nd HAA Regiment supplied another cadre to 24th HAA Training Rgt at Blackdown as the basis of a new 565 (M) HAA Bty formed on 10 June 1942; this also joined 163rd (M) HAA Rgt. ATS women operating a height and range finder on an HAA gun site, December 1942. The London Blitz had ended in May 1941 and for nearly two years the city was hardly affected by bombing raids while the Luftwaffe concentrated on coastal targets. A few sporadic attacks were made on London during 1943, by conventional bombers at night on 17 January, 3 March and 16 April, by daylight Fighter-bombers on 12 March, and by night again on 7 and 20 October.Collier, Appendix XXXVIII.Collier, Appendix XXXIX. The Luftwaffe began a new bombing campaign against London in early 1944 (the Baby Blitz), when the city was subjected to 14 raids between 21 January and 18 April. By now the night fighter defences and the London IAZ were well organised and the attackers suffered heavy losses for relatively small results. On 13 February, for example, only six out of 115 aircraft reached London, the rest being driven off. Five raids in the third week of February varying in strength from 100 to 140 aircraft were met by intense AA fire from the Thames Estuary in to the IAZ and fewer than half reached the city; 13 were shot down by AA Command, 15 by Royal Air Force night-fighters, and one 'kill' was shared.Collier, Appendix XLII.Routledge, pp. 409–10. Operation Diver A V-1 and launching ramp section on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford. More significant were the V-1 flying bombs, codenamed 'Divers', which began to be launched against London from Northern France soon after the Allies launched their invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) on D-Day. V-1s (known to Londoners as 'Doodlebugs') presented AA Command's biggest challenge since the Blitz. Defences had been planned against this new form of attack (Operation Diver), but the missiles' small size, high speed and awkward height presented a severe problem for AA guns. After two weeks' experience AA Command carried out a major reorganisation, stripping guns from the London IAZ and other parts of the UK and repositioning them along the South Coast to target V-1s coming in over the English Channel, where the gun-laying radar worked best and where a 'downed' V-1 would cause no damage. The introduction of VT Proximity fuzes also increased the 'kill rate'. 132nd (M) HAA Regiment transferred to 40 AA Brigade, which was moved into the V-1 flightpath. The whole process involved moving hundreds of guns and vehicles and thousands of servicemen and women, but a new 8-gun HAA battery site could be established in 48 hours. After moving the mobile 3.7-inch HAA guns to the coast, these were progressively replaced by the static Mark IIC model, which had power traverse, accompanied by the most sophisticated Radar No 3 Mark V (the SCR-584 radar set) and No 10 Predictor (the all-electric Bell Labs AAA Computer). In early August 132nd (M) HAA Rgt came under the command of 102 AA Brigade, which had been scheduled to take part in 'Overlord' but had been diverted to reinforce the 'Diver' defences in South East England. The guns were constantly in action and the success rate of the HAA batteries against 'Divers' rose progressively until late summer, when the launching sites in Normandy were overrun by 21st Army Group.Collier, Chapter XXIV.Routledge, pp. 407–16, Table LXX, p. 423.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. A static Mk IIC 3.7-inch gun on a Pile platform during Operation Diver. As the Luftwaffe switched to air-launching V-1s from over the North Sea, so AA Command had to uproot its static guns and redeploy them again in East Anglia. 132nd (M) HAA Regiment initially remained on the South Coast, switching to 43 AA Brigade in October, and then when that was disbanded reverting to 26 (London) AA Bde. 469 (M) HAA Battery left 132nd (M) HAA Rgt and became independent on 30 November 1944.Routledge pp. 416–8. Brussels 'X' deployment Once 21st Army Group had captured Brussels and Antwerp, these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within Germany, and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established. AA Command's experience had shown that the power-operated, remotely controlled Mk IIC 3.7-inch gun, with automatic fuze- setting, SCR 584 radar and Predictor No 10 were required to deal effectively with V-1s, but 21st Army Group's mobile HAA units did not have experience with this equipment. 132nd HAA Regiment was the second Mixed unit sent from AA Command to reinforce the Brussels 'X' defences in January 1945. It deployed in bitter winter weather: it was so cold that the oil in the guns' hydraulic power systems froze. The Brussels 'X' defences under 101 AA Brigade involved an outer line of Wireless Observer Units sited to in front of the guns to give 8 minutes' warning, then Local Warning (LW) stations positioned half way, equipped with radar to begin plotting individual missiles. Finally there was an inner belt of Observation Posts (OPs), about in front of the guns to give visual confirmation that the tracked target was a missile. The LW stations and OPs were operated by teams from the AA regiments. Radar-controlled searchlights were deployed to assist in identification and engagement of missiles at night. Unlike the anti-Diver guns firing over the English Channel or North Sea, VT fuzes could not be employed by the HAA batteries at Brussels because of the risk of casualties to troops and civilians under the missiles' flightpath. The success rate of the Brussels X defences had been low at first, but after the arrival of Mk IIC guns and experienced crews from AA Command the results improved considerably, with best results in February and March 1945. (101 AA Bde handed over command to 50 AA Bde for the last few weeks.) The number of missiles launched at Brussels dropped rapidly as 21st Army Group continued its advance, and in the last week the AA defences destroyed 97.5 per cent of those reaching the defence belt.Routledge, pp. 333–4, 338–41, Map 31. The war in Europe ended on VE Day (8 May 1945) and 132nd (Mixed) HAA Regiment and its three batteries were disbanded on 31 May.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366.

Early life and education Ikeduba although being a native of Delta State was born in Ebute-Meta in Lagos State a south-western geographical area of Nigeria predominantly occupied by the Yoruba speaking people of Nigeria and is from a family of sixfour children, two male, two female, a mother, and a fatherof which he is the first born child. Ikeduba was raised from a tender age into adulthood in Lagos state, precisely in Olokodana Street in Ebute- Metta. Ikeduba received both primary and secondary school education in Lagos state but in bid to obtain a university degree he relocated to the Benin city, a south-south geographical area of Nigeria where he applied to the University of Benin to study Economics. Ikeduba was accepted and eventually graduated from there with a B.Sc. degree in Economics. Career In an interview with Vanguard, a Nigerian print media press, Ikeduba stated that he debuted into the Nigerian movie industry in the year 2000. He described his venture into the Nigerian movie industry as a coincidence as he initially only wanted to accompany a friend to an audition for actors but on reaching their destination he decided to audition also and was successful in it as he was called back and given a movie role. Ikeduba’s ability to understand and communicate in all three major languages in Nigeria has been pivotal to his career, he acknowledges this fact and speaks publicly about it. Ikeduba debuted his acting career into the english language only conventional and mainstream Nigerian movie industry known commonly as Nollywood but eventually crossed over to the Yoruba movie industry in Nigeria with the help of Femi Ogedengbe who introduced him to Saheed Balogun who gave him a movie role in a Yoruba movie he was producing titled Omo Alhaja. Ikeduba has been stereotyped in the Nigerian movie industry as a “Bad Boy” which he attributed to his appearance, hence in almost all the movies he has featured in, he was always the antagonist or as the Nigerian media puts it “The Bad Boy”. Award Ikeduba won the award for Best Cross Over Actor at the Yoruba Movie Academy Awards (YMAA) in 2014. Personal life Ikeduba is multilingual as he can speak the Yoruba language, the Hausa Language the Igbo language as well as the English language, which is the official language of commuication in Nigeria.

With the increasing automation of heavy AA (HAA) guns, including gun-laying, fuze- setting and ammunition loading under remote control from the predictor, the question of who actually fired the gun became blurred as the war progressed. The ATS rank and file, if not always their officers, took to the new role with enthusiasm and 'Mixed' batteries and regiments with the ATS supplying two- thirds of their personnel quickly proved a success.Pile's despatch.Collier, Chapter XVII.Routledge, pp. 399–400.Routledge, pp. 338, 407.

The first of these new batteries took over an operational gun site in Richmond Park, south-west London, in August 1941, and complete regiments soon followed, including 137th (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, whose regimental headquarters formed at Newton, Chester, on 10 November 1941. It was then joined by the following batteries:Frederick, pp. 759–61, 786. * 476 (M) HAA Battery, formed on 4 September 1941 at 211th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry, from a cadre of experienced officers and gunners supplied by 115th HAA Rgt, joined on 24 November 1941 * 477 (M) HAA Bty, formed on 11 September 1941 at 205th HAA Training Rgt, Arborfield, from a cadre supplied by 122nd HAA Rgt, joined on 1 December 1941 * 481 (M) HAA Bty, formed on 18 September 1941 at 210th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry, from a cadre supplied by 101st HAA Rgt, joined on 8 December 1941 Deployment Formation sign of 4th AA Division. At the end of the year the new regiment was assigned to 33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Brigade in Liverpool, part of 4th Anti-Aircraft Division. On 5 January 1942, 477 (M) HAA Bty transferred to 142nd HAA Rgt in exchange for 487 (M) HAA Bty, which joined 137th HAA Rgt on 1 February (487 was another Oswestry-trained battery, with its cadre drawn from 107th HAA Rgt).Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/80. The Blitz had ended in May 1941, but there were still occasional Luftwaffe raids on Liverpool and Manchester, and AA Command continued to expand its capabilities. 137th (M) HAA Regiment sent a cadre to 211th HAA Training Rgt at Oswestry where it formed 574 (M) HAA Bty on 30 June 1942. Then in September the regiment moved from North West England to the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ), where it came under the command of 26 (London) AA Bde in 1st AA Division and was joined by 574 (M) HAA Bty. On 9 November 590 (M) HAA Bty also joined, having been formed at Oswestry from a 1st AA Division cadre and briefly served with 183rd (M) HAA Rgt.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82. A static Mk IIC 3.7-inch gun on a Pile platform during Operation Diver. A few sporadic attacks were made on London during 1943, by conventional bombers at night on 17 January, 3 March and 16 April, by daylight Fighter-bombers on 12 March, and by night again on 7 and 20 October.Collier, Appendix XXXVIII.Collier, Appendix XXXIX. The Luftwaffe began a new bombing campaign against London in early 1944 (the Baby Blitz), when the city was subjected to 14 raids between 21 January and 18 April. By now the night fighter defences and the London IAZ were well organised and the attackers suffered heavy losses for relatively small results. On 13 February, for example, only six out of 115 aircraft reached London, the rest being driven off. Five raids in the third week of February varying in strength from 100 to 140 aircraft were met by intense AA fire from the Thames Estuary in to the IAZ and fewer than half reached the city; 13 were shot down by AA Command, 15 by Royal Air Force night-fighters, and one 'kill' was shared.Collier, Appendix XLII.Routledge, pp. 409–10. Operation Diver A V-1 and launching ramp section on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford. More significant were the V-1 flying bombs, codenamed 'Divers', which began to be launched against London from Northern France soon after the Allies launched their invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) on D-Day. V-1s (known to Londoners as 'Doodlebugs') presented AA Command's biggest challenge since the Blitz. Defences had been planned against this new form of attack (Operation Diver), but the missiles' small size, high speed and awkward height presented a severe problem for AA guns. After two weeks' experience AA Command carried out a major reorganisation, stripping many guns from the London IAZ and other parts of the UK and repositioning them along the South Coast to target V-1s coming in over the English Channel, where the gun-laying radar worked best and where a 'downed' V-1 would cause no damage. 137th (M) HAA Regiment remained in the London IAZ, though here the guns stayed largely silent, to the dismay of Londoners. The first 'Diver' offensive ended when the launching sites in Normandy were overrun by 21st Army Group. A second campaign of air-launched missiles coming in from the North Sea led to a second redeployment by AA Command to East Anglia, but again 137th (M) HAA Rgt was unaffected by the moves.Collier, Chapter XXIV.Routledge, pp. 407–18, Table LXX, p. 423.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. 574 and 590 (M) HAA Batteries were disbanded on 16 October 1944, but the regiment was briefly joined from 7 to 30 November by 455 HAA Bty from 129th (M) HAA Rgt before it became an independent battery. Brussels 'X' deployment Private Kay Elms, ATS, of 481 Bty, 137 (M) HAA Rgt, wearing the white lanyard (and carrying a Sten gun) at camp in Belgium, 26 January 1944. Once 21st Army Group had captured Brussels and Antwerp, these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within Germany, and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established. AA Command's experience had shown that the power-operated, remotely controlled static Mk IIC 3.7-inch HAA gun, which had power traverse and automatic fuze-setting, accompanied by the most sophisticated Radar No 3 Mark V (the SCR-584 radar set) and No 10 Predictor (the all-electric Bell Labs AAA Computer), were required to deal effectively with V-1s, but 21st Army Group's mobile HAA units did not have experience with this equipment. 137th (M) HAA Regiment was the first Mixed unit sent from AA Command to reinforce the Brussels 'X' defences in January 1945. It deployed in bitter winter weather: it was so cold that the oil in the guns' hydraulic power systems froze. The Brussels 'X' defences under 101 AA Brigade involved an outer line of Wireless Observer Units sited to in front of the guns to give 8 minutes' warning, then Local Warning (LW) stations positioned half way, equipped with radar to begin plotting individual missiles. Finally there was an inner belt of Observation Posts (OPs), about in front of the guns to give visual confirmation that the tracked target was a missile. The LW stations and OPs were operated by teams from the AA regiments. Radar-controlled searchlights were deployed to assist in identification and engagement of missiles at night. Unlike the anti-Diver guns firing over the English Channel or North Sea, VT Proximity fuzes could not be employed by the HAA batteries at Brussels because of the risk of casualties to troops and civilians under the missiles' flightpath. The success rate of the Brussels X defences had been low at first, but after the arrival of Mk IIC guns and experienced crews from AA Command the results improved considerably, with best results in February and March 1945. (101 AA Bde handed over command to 50 AA Bde for the last few weeks.) The number of missiles launched at Brussels dropped rapidly as 21st Army Group continued its advance, and in the last week the AA defences destroyed 97.5 per cent of those reaching the defence belt.Routledge, pp. 333–4, 338–41, Map 31. The war in Europe ended on VE Day (8 May 1945) and 137th (Mixed) HAA Regiment and its three batteries was disbanded on 25 October.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366.

The new battery was converted into a Mixed unit (with two-thirds of its personnel supplied by the ATS) on 25 June, and took over an operational gun site in Richmond Park, south-west London, in August.Frederick, pp. 758, 780.Frederick, p. 803. 435 (Mixed) HAA Battery was regimented with 105th HAA Regiment in 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, part of 1st Anti-Aircraft Division operating the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ) of defences. On 6 October 1941 the battery was transferred within the brigade to join the newly-formed 132nd (Mixed) HAA Regiment.Frederick, p. 780.Frederick, p. 785.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/80. ATS women operating a height and range finder on an HAA gun site, December 1942. Deployment The London Blitz had ended in May 1941 and for nearly two years the city was hardly affected by bombing raids apart from a few sporadic attacks during 1943.Collier, Appendix XXXVIII.Collier, Appendix XXXIX. The Luftwaffe began a new bombing campaign against London in early 1944 (the Baby Blitz). By now the night fighter defences and the London IAZ were well organised and the attackers suffered heavy losses for relatively small results.Collier, Appendix XLII.Routledge, pp. 409–10. Operation Diver More significant were the V-1 flying bombs, codenamed 'Divers', which began to be launched against London from Northern France soon after the Allies launched their invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) on D-Day. V-1s (known to Londoners as 'Doodlebugs') presented AA Command's biggest challenge since the Blitz: the missiles' small size, high speed and awkward height presented a severe problem for AA guns. After two weeks' experience AA Command carried out a major reorganisation, stripping guns from the London IAZ, including 132nd (M) HAA Rgt, and repositioning them along the South Coast to target V-1s coming in over the English Channel, where the gun-laying radar worked best and where a 'downed' V-1 would cause no damage. The whole process involved moving hundreds of guns and vehicles and thousands of servicemen and women, but a new 8-gun HAA battery site could be established in 48 hours. After moving the mobile 3.7-inch HAA guns to the coast, these were progressively replaced by the static Mark IIC model, which had power traverse, accompanied by the most sophisticated Radar No 3 Mark V (the SCR-584 radar set) and No 10 Predictor (the all-electric Bell Labs AAA Computer). The guns were constantly in action and the success rate of the HAA batteries against 'Divers' rose progressively until late summer, when the launching sites in Normandy were overrun by 21st Army Group.Collier, Chapter XXIV.Routledge, pp. 408–16, Table LXX, p. 423.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. Brussels 'X' deployment Private Kay Elms, ATS, of a Mixed HAA battery, wearing the white lanyard (and carrying a Sten gun) in Belgium, 26 January 1944. Once 21st Army Group had captured Brussels and Antwerp, these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within Germany, and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established. AA Command's experience had shown that the power-operated, remotely controlled Mk IIC 3.7-inch gun, with automatic fuze- setting, SCR 584 radar and Predictor No 10 were required to deal with V-1s, but 21st Army Group's mobile HAA units did not have experience with this equipment. 132nd HAA Regiment was the second Mixed unit sent from AA Command to reinforce the Brussels 'X' defences in January 1945. It deployed in bitter winter weather: it was so cold that the oil in the guns' hydraulic power systems froze. The success rate of the Brussels X defences had been low at first, but after the arrival of Mk IIC guns and experienced crews from AA Command the results improved considerably, with best results in February and March 1945. The number of missiles launched at Brussels dropped rapidly as 21st Army continued its advance, and in the last week the AA defences destroyed 97.5 per cent of those reaching the defence belt.Routledge, pp. 333–4, 338–41. The war in Europe ended on VE Day (8 May 1945) and 435 (Mixed) HAA Battery along with the rest of the regiment was disbanded on 31 May.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. Insignia Brass collar badge of the Royal Artillery While the male members of the battery wore the Royal Artillery's 'gun' cap badge, the women wore the ATS cap badge, but in addition they wore the RA's 'grenade' shoulder badge as a special badge above the left breast pocket of the tunic. Both sexes wore the white RA lanyard on the right shoulder.Sainsbury, Plate 9, p. 7.

By 2020, it operated four types of businesses including high volume wholesale produce, small wholesalers, retail, storage, and a market restaurant. Benton Harbor, Michigan is located in Michigan's fruit belt and is situated part way between Chicago and Detroit. The market operates seasonally. History At inception, the market operated from the city wharves on Lake Michigan. When the primary mode of transport shifted from ships to trains and trucks, the market moved to the north side of Benton Harbor. In the 1940s the market had grown to the point that it was called \\"the largest cash-to-growers outlet in the world\\". The market supplied produce to restaurants, grocery stores, and retail customers. In 1960 the market accommodated 293 buyer stalls on a 16-acre facility which included wholesale and retail markets, a restaurant, and a migrant labor camp. The principle products sold at that time were strawberries, peaches and tomatoes, representing half of the entire United States sales of these crops. The market was owned and operated by the City of Benton Harbor, but today it is owned and operated by Benton Harbor Fruit Market Inc. On July 20, 1970 the market was the destination for a protest march organized by Michigan labor activists in support of the California Grape Boycott organized by Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and the United Farm Workers. In 2010, the nearby Southwest Michigan Regional Airport sued the Market for eminent domain to gain five acres of the fruit market's land. In 2011 A Berrien County Circuit Court lawsuit resulted in a $2.25 million compensation to the Market. References External links * Dunbar, Willis Frederick. Western Michigan at Work.

He is the former program director of the Evangelische Omroep, a Dutch broadcasting organisation with Protestant foundations.  Life  Knevel grew up in a Christian-Reformed family with a municipal civil servant father and stay-at-home mother. He studied economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Only during his study time, he became a devout Christian. In interviews, Knevel pointed at a specific moment that God entered his life during an economics lecture, and that he decided that he wanted to become a minister instead. Knevel changed his field of study to theology: first at the Vrije Universiteit, but after a year he switched to Utrecht University, where he graduated in 1979. Alongside his study, he taught theology and society sciences at the Christian high school Farelcollege in Ridderkerk between 1976 and 1978.  Evangelische Omroep  In 1978, Knevel started as free lance desk reporter at the Evangelische Omroep (EO), a Dutch public broadcasting organisation with evangelical-protestant roots. He quickly became a staff member in 1979, and in 1989 took the position of head of informative programs. In 1992, he started presenting the national television talk show Het Elfde Uur (the eleventh hour). Alongside his public facing job, he took a leadership position of the broadcasting organisation, and became one of its directors between 1993 and 2006. Between 2001 and 2004, Knevel had his own national talkshow on Saturday, Knevel op Zaterdag (Knevel on Saturday). On the radio, he presented Andries Radio. Between 2007 and 2014, he presented a summer evening daily talk show on the primary national channel together with Tijs van den Brink: Knevel & Van den Brink. Also together with Van den Brink, he presented the weekly show Moraalridders (Moralists) between 2010 and 2012 and he presented regularly on other EO-produced shows. In 2013, Knevel started a series of interview or conversation programs about religion. This was first a more general series under the name Andries, but later he focused on the interface between religion and science in Andries en de Wetenschappers (Andries and the scientists). = Het Elfde Uur = Andries got national recognition for his show Het Elfde Uur. His style was sometimes confrontational and sharp, which was both appreciated and criticized. Especially his gesture of a raised index finger became synonymous for his style, even if he later transformed the gesture. At the concluding episode in 2009, he was awarded the grade of Officer in the chivalrous Order of Orange- Nassau. = Creationism = In 2005, Knevel declared in a radio talk show that he no longer accepted the classical creationism teaching that the earth was created in six days. He was at the time still a director at the EO, and considered it no longer scientifically acceptable to rely on the historical accuracy of Genesis 1. This was especially notable because the EO was for many years one of the main voices that promoted the creationism in the Netherlands. In 2009, he angered several of the EO members because he signed during a TV show a document that he did not literally believe in the creationist teachings, and that Darwins theory may be true. He stated that he could be an devout orthodox Protestant, without believing that the world was created six thousand years ago in six times 24 hours, and that he regretted that he misled viewers and children in the past. He later had to offer apologies for giving an impression that his personal view was the view of the EO.  Authorship  Knevel authored a number of books on theology and television. In 2007 and 2008 he published a diary on those years. Published books include: * Jezus, de enige weg (Jesus, the only road, 1991) * De wereld in huis (The world at home, 1992) * Doe dat ding dan uit! (Then turn off that thing, 1993) * Geloven doet pijn (Believing hurts, 1995) * Ruim van hart (A generous heart, 2000) * Avonduren (Evening hours, 2007) * Is het waar? (Is it true?, 2008) He was also editor and secondary author of a number of theological publications, Theologische Verkenningen (Theological explorations). He was editor-in-chief at the Christian opinion magazine Koers and wrote various opinion columns for evangelical and catholic magazines.  Personal life  Knevel is married and has three children. He is a member of the Christian Reformed Churches and visits also the evangelical international church Crossroads in Amstelveen. He often preaches as a theologist in numerous churches.

He is currently held at Nieuw Vosseveld, a maximum security prison in Vught, for suspected involvement in at least ten murders related to organised crime, as well as for his involvement in drug trafficking and the leading of a criminal organisation. Until his late 2019 arrest in Dubai, Taghi was the most wanted criminal in the Netherlands with a record-breaking reward of €100,000. Accusations Taghi's suspected crimes include the murder of Redouan B. (brother of crown witness Nabil B.) and of Nabil B.'s lawyer, Derk Wiersum. The latter was considered an attack on the Dutch legal system. Documents produced by The United States' Drug Enforcement Agency, the DEA, were sent to the Dutch police exposed what would be a super drug cartel headed by Ridouan Taghi, Raffaele Imperiale (Camorra's drugs and arms dealer), Daniel Kinahan (Irish drug trafficker) and Edin G. (Bosnian drug trafficker). The group was observed by the DEA having meetings in the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, where is the base of the alleged cartel. The meetings took place in 2017, however, it only reached the Dutch media in October 2019. The DEA regards this as one of the world's fifty largest drug cartels, with a virtually monopoly of the Peruvian cocaine and would control around a third of the cocaine trade in Europe. Yet, according to the DEA documents, the destination for all the drugs shipments would be the Dutch ports. Taghi managed to evade capture by constantly altering his appearance and using false passports and visas. He was arrested in Dubai on 16 December 2019. As the Netherlands does not have an extradition treaty with Dubai, Taghi was deported three days after his arrest; based on him being declared as persona non grata by the emirate, as he had entered it under a false identity.

Popular with bird watchers and naturalists, the rustic trail provides Upper Mississippi River gorge access and views. The trail is separate from the adjacent multi-use bicycle path, taking hikers past sandy beaches, an oak savanna restoration project, and the floodplain forest. The trail has multiple access points and the section from East 38th Street to East 44th Street is paved. Described as moderate and for all hiking skill levels, the out-and-back Winchell Trail has total elevation gain of . Portions of the trail can be hiked in near solitude as its age and general destitute make it a widely forgotten place to explore.Larsen, Elizabeth Foy (11 April 2020). \\"38 Perfect Parks: Ungroomed Adventure\\". Mpls.St.Paul Magazine.  Route description  = Access points = Winchell Trail has multiple access points from the West River Parkway trail of the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. The northern trailhead is near Franklin Avenue South and West River Parkway. The southern trailhead is near East 44th Street and West River Parkway. There is also a signed entrance to the trail at East 36th Street with several paths down to the oak savanna site. There are a few crescent-shaped parking lots long the trail route, two near East 36th Street and one near East 44th Street. Many of the various access points have racks for bicycles, which are not permitted on Winchell Trail or other natural surface paths in the gorge. = Major points of interest =  List from north to south  * Northern trailhead marker and Mesabi Iron Range boulder near Franklin Avenue South. * Hujduk Spring near East 26th Street *White Sands Beach near East 28th Street *Minneapolis Rowing Club Boathouse near East Lake Street *Longfellow Beach near East 33rd Street *Overlook of the river gorge at East 36th Street * Oak savanna restoration near East 36th Street *Southern trailhead marker and overlook of the river gorge near East 44th Street  Mesabi Iron Range boulder  The northern trailhead features a large boulder with a bronze tribute plague describing the scientific contributions of the trail’s namesake, Newton Horace Winchell. The boulder was brought from the Mesabi Iron Range by Winchell's eldest son. The plague on it reads: > The Winchell Trail marked by this boulder brought from the Mesabi Iron > Range, was named in honor of the eminent geologist Newton Horace Winchell > whose scientific studies along this river provided a measure for the time > since the glacial period. His early appreciation of the economic importance > of Minnesota's resources did much to preserve for the people some share in > the state's mineral wealth.  Hajduk Spring  Hajduk Spring in Minneapolis is a falling water source from the limestone bluff above the Mississippi River near East 26th Street. Named after an area resident who promoted the spring, Harry Hajduk (pronounced “Hi-duck”), by the parks board in 1977, it was a popular drinking water source and featured access paths and a platform to fill jugs. The original path to the spring off the main Winchell Trail has fallen into ruin. Water quality experts do not consider the spring’s water to be drinkable because of the use of herbicides and fertilizers on nearby residential lawns.  Oak savanna restoration  The mesic oak savanna near the end of East 36th Street is a unique and sensitive landscape. At this location, Winchell Trail splits off, taking hikers either down by the river while another path crosses the hilly restoration site with remnant prairie and oak savanna. The scattered oak trees are spread out enough that there is no closed canopy, giving way to prairie grasses, forbs, and clover lawn. Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is considering enhancements, including closure of unsustainable trails, landscape restoration, and replacement of interpretive-educational signs. = Nearby sites = The hiking path's southern terminus connects seamlessly to the shared-use, bicycle trail at West River Parkway and East 44th Street. Hikers can continue southward to Lock and Dam No. 1, Minnehaha Falls Lower Glen Trail in Minnehaha Park, and Fort Snelling State Park via Minnehaha Trail.  History of the trail  = First people = The Dakota people have lived along the shores of the Upper Mississippi River for many centuries. The contemporary route of Winchell Trail may have followed an original path created by Dakota people in the area. Residents and visitors who hike the trail experience what a native oak savanna looked like prior to European- American settlement. = Construction = Minneapolis Parks Superintendent Theodore Wirth commissioned Winchell Trail. It was constructed between 1912 and 1914, and later improved by the Works Progress Administration between 1936 and 1938, which included construction of several stone walls and staircases. The trail is named after Newton Horace Winchell, a Minnesota state geologist who surveyed the area of Minneapolis in the 1870s and published many works about measurement of the glacial age. The pathway was formally named \\"Winchell Trail\\" after his death in 1914. Winchell was not involved in its design or construction. = Management = Jurisdiction of Winchell Trail is complex and overlapping. Running along the eastern edge of the greater Longfellow community of Minneapolis, the trail is part of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area and Mississippi River Gorge Regional Park. Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is responsible for management and maintenance. In 1998, the Longfellow neighborhood council, park board, and National Park Service formed a partnership to restore the native prairie and oak savanna at East 36th Street. Since the early 2000s, there have been attempts by the city to clear woodlands along the bluff of invasive plant species such as buckthorn. = Recognition = In 2010, a local television station named Winchell Trail as one of the five best hiking trails in the Twin Cities, and in 2018 editors of a local magazine featured Winchell Trail in its review of the best hikes and walks in Minnesota, including it in the category for \\"Rigorous Hikes for the Adventurer.\\"  Future  Several potential enhancements to Winchell Trail were under consideration by the park board in 2019 as part of long-term planning.

It is chartered by the State of New York and a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. History What is known today as IDB Bank first began in 1949 as a single representative office in New York City for Tel Aviv-based Discount Bank. The office had just a few employees and limited contact with the public. In 1961, New York State law changed to allow foreign banks to operate full branches. IDB immediately began work on opening a full-service branch of its own. On April 4, 1962, former First Lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt officiated the opening of IDB's first-ever branch at 511 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, Manhattan. In 1968, IDB acquired HIAS Immigrant Bank, a New York State licensed bank located at 425 Lafayette Street in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan. Established in 1923 as a service of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, HIAS Immigrant Bank's sole purpose was to facilitate remittance or money transfers to and from immigrants’ families abroad, which was then a service not offered by most U.S. banks. IDB announced it would operate the acquisition as Israel Discount Trust Company, a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. By 1980, IDB became a wholly owned subsidiary of Discount Bank as \\"Israel Discount Bank of New York\\" and later purchased the registered service mark \\"IDB Bank\\" to reflect its expansion into markets outside of New York and describe its service as a \\"bank\\". From billionaire business tycoons to innovative entrepreneurs, some of IDB's notable banking clients include real estate developers Harry B. Macklowe and Francis J. Greenburger; angel investor David Tisch; John Catsimatidis, owner of Gristedes, the largest grocery chain in Manhattan; apparel maker Jordache and the Nakash family who founded it; and Howard Lorber, the President and CEO of Vector Group, a holding company that owns Douglas Elliman, one of the largest residential real estate firms in the United States, as well as the Pyramid, Liggett Select and Eve tobacco brands. Headquarters & Locations Though IDB's headquarters have long been located at 511 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, Manhattan, it will relocate just one block away to 43 West 42nd Street in 2021. IDB will move into HBO's former headquarters in the W.R. Grace Building, where office furniture maker Humanscale and Italian spirits group Campari Americas are also headquartered. Outside of New York, IDB has physical locations in New Jersey, Florida and California, as well as Chile, Uruguay and Israel.

There are various trees with benches on the square, which is a 'resting place'. A statue of Rubens, designed in 1840 and erected in 1843 by Willem Geefs, is in the center of the square. At least since the 13th century, the south side of the Cathedral of Our Lady served as an Antwerp cemetery, for the poorer residents who could not afford to be buried in the church itself. In 1784, Emperor Joseph II forbade further usage of cemeteries within the city walls. In 1795, the grounds of the Cathedral, were claimed by the French. A few years later, in 1799, the walls around it were demolished. Construction of the Place de l’égalité (Equality Square) began in 1803. The houses located in the area were demolished and three rows of lime trees were planted. In 1805 it was solemnly inaugurated as Place Bonaparte (Bonaparte Square) in honor of Napoleon, and retained that name until 1815. It was the intention of the French revolutionaries to place a memorial in the center of the square in honor of Freedom. In 1797, during the disputes between the church and the municipal administration about the expropriation of the cemetery, the municipal officer François Roché was murdered in the cathedral. Between 1819 and 1877 the Court of First Instance resided in the south of the Cathedral grounds, a site currently situated by the Post Office. In 1885, in the building in which the current Hilton hotel is located, Frenchman Adolphe Kileman started a department store, named the Grand Bazar du Bon Marché.

The work was executed en plein air in oil on canvas with a relatively large size of 82 by 101 cm. and currently belongs in the collection of the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. The woman in the painting is Jeanne-Marguerite Lecadre, the young wife of his well-to-do cousin Paul- Eugene Lecadre. The Lecadres lived at Le Havre and had a country house, Le Coteau, in nearby Sainte-Adresse, in the garden of which the painting was made during a short visit. X-ray analysis has revealed that it was actually painted over a previous picture. The style of the painting is quite composed and detailed, unlike the typically impressionist works for which Monet was later acclaimed. Three principal objects, Jeanne-Marguerite, the central flowering rose bush in the bed of bright red flowers and the flowering bush on the right provide an ordered structure and Jeanne-Marguerite's bright white dress contrasts vividly with the reds, pinks and greens of the garden plants and trees. The subject matter foreshadowed Monet's lifelong passion for painting flowers and gardens in a natural setting.

It aired in the United States on Fox on December 15, 2019. The episode was written by Jeff Westbrook & John Frink and was directed by Steven Dean Moore. Plot Five weeks before Christmas, Lenny orders his Christmas gift online. Two days later UPS delivers it, but someone immediately steals it. Working as a lighthouse keeper, Sideshow Bob is visited by Cassandra Patterson, a neighbor. She tells him she mentioned him in town, and Bob knows he let his guard down around her when two men come visiting, but they offer him a job at the Springfield Mall as Santa Claus. Meanwhile, more people are getting robbed of their delivered gifts. The Simpsons visit Santa's village. Bart skips the line to see Santa, and realizes who he really is. Bob tries to strangle him, but he can't because he refuses to break character. When a plan to trick the robbers with gunpowder fails for Lenny, Lenny writes 'SB' with his blood. When the news is reported, Homer calls the cops to reveal that SB means Selma Bouvier and she is arrested, freeing the recently-held suspects Scott Bakula, Steve Ballmer, and Sandra Bullock. Bart still suspects Bob, who agrees to help Bart find the culprit by concealing himself in a box that is placed on the porch. The thief arrives and the family follows the van to a hangar, finding out Waylon Smithers and Mr. Burns were the culprits. Lisa suggests Burns did it because he's depressed. Mr. Burns tells the story of how as a child he was heartbroken one Christmas, when he asked Santa for just a hug and a smile from his parents and they never delivered, sending him to boarding school instead. Bob as Santa convinces Burns that his harsh upbringing made him the success he is today. Burns and Smithers then return the presents. On Christmas Day, Homer and Marge snuggle together just before the kids open the presents, and they go to the basement to enjoy some time together, just after Grampa takes a picture to bless everyone with \\"Merry Christmas from the Simpsons!\\". Back at the lighthouse, Cassandra brings Bob a Christmas present, a rake, and tells Bob that she knows who he is. She tells Bob that she wants him to kiss her before the two of them start singing their version of \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" together. She and Bob then sign a \\"Snuggle Contract\\" saying that both of them knew what they were getting into, just after Captain Horatio McCallister crashes into a rock because the lighthouse light wasn't lit. At the Springfield International Airport, Ballmer meets Mr. Burns. Burns asks him how he could be so positive about everything and asked if he could teach him how to do it. Ballmer then gives Burns a pep talk. When Burns tries to copy his motions, he hurts himself and has to be taken away in an ambulance, with Steve Ballmer going with him. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a C, stating \\"'Bobby, It's Cold Outside,' (title referring to one aforementioned credits filler gag) at least sees everyone's favorite ineffective psycho would-be murderer back in town for the holidays. Of all the recurring, non-cast characters, Bob's the one most likely to brighten up my day/any episode, simply due to Kelsey Grammer's obvious joy in the villainous role. (Plus, they always let him sing—put 'Carol Of The Bells' on your Sideshow Bob mix CD.) The never-to-end saga of Robert Underdunk Terwilliger's bloodlust for the blood of one Bart Simpson stretches all the way back to The Simpsons' 12th-ever episode, and he's been swinging and whiffing hard for some 29 years at this point. Like most recurring characters and bits, Bob's appearances have waxed and waned in comic effectiveness, but, hey, always nice to have Grammer in the house, once more essaying his second-most(?) famous role.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave this episode three and a half stars out of five and said \\"is a double-stuffed bag for the chimney.

Services at Soar were held in the Welsh language. Soar was a branch of Heolyfelin, a neighbouring Baptist chapel. The first services were held in houses in the locality until the first chapel building was erected in 1859 with seating for 380 people. Like many Baptist chapels in the locality, Thomas Price was involved in its formation and preached at the opening services, together with Benjamin Evans of Heolyfelin. Evans served as minister of Soar, as well as Heolyfelin, until his departure to Neath in 1861. His successor, William Harris, was also minister of Soar as well as Heolyfelin until 1876. Daniel Jones was the first minister from 1876 until 1898. During his ministry a nw vestry was built in 1892 at a cost of £300. He was succeeded by D.G. Price (1900–07) but after his departure, Soar was without a minister for ten years. Eventually, Vaughan Pugh became minister in 1917, and during a short but successful ministry, several renovations were made including a new vestry. Following his departure there was another period without a minister and Cynog Williams of Heolyfelin took charge of Soar. (1907-20) In 1938, Christmas Jones became minister of Soar as well as Saron, Godreaman. During this time there were some disagreements within the church and in 1947 it was reported that the membership was small. By then, the first woman deacon, Lizzie Anne Rowlands, had been elected. Christmas Jones served until 1954. D. Meredith Morgan was the last minister. The chapel closed in the early 1980s.

Design The wooden SAM-6 had a conventional tail on its short fuselage but its low wing had, in addition, Scheibe-type, oval wingtip fins and rudders. Sprung skids on their underside provided the lateral stability that its central undercarriage did not. It was powered by a , three cylinder M-23 radial engine mounted in the pointed nose of its deep fuselage and had a single seat, open cockpit. Development For its first flight, made in early 1934, the SAM-6 had a long, non-retracting central ski rather than a wheel, and tail ski rather than a skid, both mounted on vertical shock- absorbing struts. The trials were reasonably successful and the main ski was replaced by a wheel in a trouser fairing. No reports from tests with this landing gear are known but by late 1934 the SAM-6 had been modified into the more conventional SAM-6bis, which had two fixed, trousered mainwheels. It also had a second, tandem seat in an enclosed, instrumented cockpit. Variants ;SAM-6: Original configuration with central mono-skid/wheel main gear.

She was awarded the 2019 Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency Council Award.  Early life and education  Latchman was born in Trinidad and Tobago. In 1972, shortly after completing her A-Levels, Latchman joined the University of the West Indies (UWI) Seismic Research Centre as a technician. In 1977 she started a part-time undergraduate degree in natural sciences. She worked on the La Soufrière volcanic eruption with Keith Rowley in 1979 and worked at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory. In 1982, after an earthquake swarm that occurred in the vicinity of Tobago, Latchman became interested in seismicity. She worked with Frank Dale Morgan, a visiting academic from Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was working at the Seismic Research Centre. Her early work considered the development of simple microprocessors that could convert the acoustic recordings of seismic events into digital signals that can be analysed on a computer.  Research and career  Latchman was selected to take part in the International Seismological Centre in 1988 and spent two years analysing global seismicity. She started a master's research project into the fault system of Tobago, and earned her degree in 1998. She joined the academic staff at the UWI in 1999 whilst working toward a doctorate in the Tobago and Earthquakes. She was eventually promoted to Director of the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre. She was responsible for the collection of seismic data from fifty stations throughout the Eastern Caribbean. She has made efforts to communicate and better prepare people for seismic hazards in the West Indies. Latchman called for local governments to include earthquake preparation in their policy work, including considering their infrastructure, medical equipment preparation and enforcement of building codes. Latchman retired from the UWI Seismic Research Centre in 2019. She was visited by Keith Rowley, her former colleague and now Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2019 Latchman was awarded the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency Council Award. Alongside her research, Latchman is commmited to public engagement and outreach. She has been involved in a photographic exhibition that explored the volcanic activity of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

From the 128 runnings of the Belmont Futurity Stakes since its inception in 1888, through 2019 Mother Goose is one of only thirteen fillies to have ever won the event. The Mother Goose Stakes at New York's Belmont Park is named in her honor. Breeding A Harry Whitney homebred, Mother Goose was a full brother to Whichone, himself an American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt who also won the Belmont Futurity in 1929. Their sire was Chicle who was bred and foaled in France by their American owner due to the complete shutdown of horseracing in 1911 and 1912 in the State of New York as a result of the Legislature's passage of the Hart–Agnew Law. Brought to the United States by owner/breeder Harry Whitney, Chicle would become the Leading sire in North America in 1929 and the Leading broodmare sire in North America in 1942. Chicle was the son of Spearmint, winner of the Epsom Derby in England and the Grand Prix de Paris in France, both races the then most prestigious in their country. Spearmint became an outstanding sire whose progeny included Johren, Plucky Liege Royal Lancer, Spion Kop. Jockey Danny Maher, U. S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee and twice the British flat racing Champion Jockey was quoted as saying that Spearmint was the best horse he ever rode. Spearmint's sire Carbine was a New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame and Australian Racing Hall of Fame inductee. Chicle won the 1915 Champagne Stakes in fast time beating a field of six other runners including Friar Rock who in 1916 would be named American Horse of the Year. Chicle beat Friar Rock again in the 1916 Brooklyn Derby. The dam of Mother Goose, and Whichone, was the unraced Flying Witch. She was a daughter of the three time Leading sire and U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Broomstick who in turn was sired by Ben Brush, twice a U.S. National Champion runner and Leading Sire as well as a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. 1924: Two-year-old season Several times during 1924 Mother Goose would go head-to-head with her very good stablemate Maud Muller, a filly who was also bred and owned by Harry Whitney. Trained by Fred Hopkins, the two fillies would share American Co-Champion Two-Year-Old Filly honors.The Bloodhorse.com Champion's history charts Mother Goose got her first career win on April 24, 1924 in a four and a half furlong event for two-year-old maiden fillies at Havre de Grace Racetrack. Ridden by Linus McAtee she won by two lengths, easily defeating six other runners while breaking the track record by two- fifths of a second. At Jamaica Race Course, Mother Goose ran third in the May 13 Rosedale Stakes under future Hall of Fame jockey Ivan Parke. A rarity in racing, the winner Maud Miller, runner-up Swinging, and third-place finisher Mother Goose all had the same owner and trainer. On May 25, Mother Goose earned first place money of $4,925 for winning the five furlong Fashion Stakes at Belmont Park under jockey Jimmy Burke beating stablemate Maud Muller by 1½ lengths in a field of seven. At Aqueduct Racetrack Mother Goose ran second to stablemate Maud Muller in the July 4 Astoria Stakes run at five furlongs. For the huge field of twenty-nine juveniles competing in the September 14 Belmont Futurity Stakes it would be the most important event of their year and a race with a winner's share 13 times what Mother Goose had earned for her win in the Fashion Stakes. Run at a distance of 6 furlongs, jockey Linus McAtee positioned the filly well and as they came into the homestretch Mother Goose was running second to J. Edwin Griffith's good colt Single Foot, a very good colt who had already won several top stakes on Maryland racetracks. Taking the lead, Mother Goose held off a strong charge from Marshall Field's Pimlico Futurity winner Stimulus to take the $65,730 first place money by a head. From ten starts in 1924, Mother Goose ended her two-year-old campaign with a record of 3-1-3. She had earnings of $72,755 which ranked second in the United States to Master Charlie. 1925: Three-year-old season On April 16 the Daily Racing Form reported that Mother Goose was being trained in Maryland for participation in the 1925 Kentucky Derby to be run May 16. She was also nominated for the May 30 Kentucky Oaks, and for the Preakness Stakes which in 1925 would be run eight days prior to the Kentucky Derby. Mother Goose did not run in any of these events and would end her career without racing as a three- year-old. Broodmare legacy Mother Goose was sent to Whitney Farm near Lexington, Kentucky to stand as a broodmare. While none of her progeny made an impact in racing, her daughter Arbitrator by Peace Chance was the dam of Almahmoud who was bred by Harry Whitney's son, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. Almahmoud holds an important place in Thoroughbred breeding as the dam of both Cosmah and Natalma. Cosmah was a top quality broodmare whose progeny includes Halo. Natalma was the dam of legendary sire and sire of sires Northern Dancer.

He is director of the Institute for sexology and sexual medicine at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin.  Life  Klaus Michael Beier began studying medicine in 1979 and philosophy at the Free University of Berlin in 1980. He received his doctorate in medicine in 1986 and two years later in philosophy. In 1988 he became a scientific assistant at the Research and Councelling Centre for Sexual Medicine of the University Hospital in Kiel. There he habilitated in 1994 in sexual medicine and in 1995 was appointed to the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, at that time a medical faculty of the Humboldt University Berlin. He is a specialist in psychosomatic medicine, has additional academic licences for psychotherapy, psychoanalysis and sexual medicine and has been director of the newly founded Institute for Sexology and Sexual Medicine at the Charité since 1996. In teaching, he represents sexology on an interdisciplinary scale (lectures for students in humanities and social sciences) and sexual medicine in medical school studies. In 2017, he was awarded the Cross of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany for his achievements in the field of sexology and for his commitment to the prevention of child sexual abuse. Beier's commitment to the prevention of child sexual abuse was largely based on his follow-up examinations of formerly assessed sex offenders, making it possible to assess and make predictions about different \\"offender types\\" and revealed the significantly higher risk of recidivism among men with pedophilic sexual preference compared to offenders who are not sexually inclined towards children, but who nevertheless sexually abuse children for various reasons. The term \\"dissexuality\\" was coined in this context to define sexual behaviour disorders as a failure to conform to social norms in terms of respecting the sexual integrity of others which highlights the fact that most offences are not known to the justice system, but nevertheless have the same negative consequences for the victims. Another focus of Beier's work is the development of the Syndyastic Sexual Therapy together with the Austrian sexologist Kurt Loewit. It focuses on the attachment dimension of sexuality and the fulfilment of basic needs in terms of closeness, acceptance, security, trust and acceptance by the partner. By systematically presenting the subject of sexual medicine and its curricular implementation in corresponding upgrade training courses, Beier was successful in establishing the additional title/degree ‘sexual medicine’ in the official training regulations of the Berlin Medical Association in 2007 and, recently, the German Medical Association (2018).

Overview Hostage diplomacy is the taking of hostages for diplomatic purposes. It is an asymmetric tool of diplomacy. It often manifests as foreigners being arrested on trumped-up charges and then held as bargaining chips. Modern examples =China= According to The Guardian China has a track record of hostage diplomacy but has repeatedly denied engaging in the practice. From 1967 to 1969 the PRC kept two dozen British diplomats and civilians as de facto hostages. The British were able to effect the release of their personnel by decoupling the hostage situation from broader political and economic issues through protracted negotiation. It is widely believed that China detained two Canadians in response to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou. In 2019, Australian Yang Hengjun's detention was also linked to a renewed effort at hostage diplomacy in response to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou. Prior to Hengjun's detention Australian government had sharply criticized the Chinese government for detaining the two Canadians. The 2020 arrest of the Australian news anchor Cheng Lei has been viewed as a possible incidence of hostage diplomacy. The Lowy Institute has concluded that China's use of hostage diplomacy, among other things, undermine's their “peaceful rise” narrative. The Taiwanese government has expressed concerns that the Hong Kong national security law will be used to facilitate further Chinese hostage diplomacy. According to Taiwan News in 2020 China began practicing hostage diplomacy towards Taiwan, a target against which it hadn’t been used for some time. =Turkey= According to Eric Edelman and Aykan Erdemir of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, hostage diplomacy has been widely used by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The case of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor working in Turkey imprisoned in 2016, has been widely referred to as a case of diplomatic hostage taking. =Iran= Modern Iranian hostage diplomacy began soon after the Iranian revolution with the Iran hostage crisis. Iran's government has used hostage diplomacy as a key diplomatic tool. Hostages have included, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Jolie King, Kylie Moore- Gilbert, Morad Tahbaz, Kamal Foroughi, Aras Amiri, Kameel Ahmady, and Anousheh Ashouri. =North Korea= North Korea has made wide use of hostage diplomacy as a tool against the US, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia and various European nations. Those held hostage are often tourists or exchange students who are either charged with minor offenses or espionage. In recent years it has been speculated that the regime of Kim Jong Un had evolved from using hostages to gain leverage to using hostages to gain leverage and as human shields to protect against a feared American intervention. The case of Otto Warmbier, which ended in Warmbier's death soon after his release, is a particularly well known example of North Korean hostage diplomacy.

The Cazenovia Seminary, though not theological in its purpose, was a three-year program associated with the Methodist Episcopal Church. After completing the program in 1869, Combs graduated top of her class with honors. To finance her desire to attend medical school, Combs looked for domestic employment. She soon found a wealthy family that was willing to employ her. Combs managed to perform her domestic responsibilities while attending medical school. Combs enrolled at the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1870.Ancestry.com. U.S., School Catalogs, 1765-1935 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, US: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2012. She drew the attention of the Methodist women in Philadelphia who helped her continue her studies. Combs received her degree from the Women's Medical College on March 12, 1873 in Philadelphia.  Career  =Missionary work= Almost immediately upon receiving her medical degree, Combs was commissioned by the Women's Foreign Ministry Society (WFMS). Although she intended to serve in India, she boarded a ship for Peking, China on June 5, 1873.National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington D.C.; Roll #: 196; Volume #: Roll 196 - 11 Jun 1873 - 30 Jun 1873 Among the other passengers on the ship was Andrew Stritmatter who had been commissioned to work in Jiujiang. Stritmatter and Combs grew close during their voyage and the couple would ultimately marry in the coming years. Combs departed from San Francisco, but her journey was delayed due to an unfortunate illness. Her illness held her in Japan for several weeks before being well enough to continue travel. She arrived in Peking in late August or early September, almost three months after her original departure and quickly began her work. She is noted for being the first female medical missionary to provide medical care in China. = Establishing the first women's hospital = William Lockhart Although medical attention had arrived in Peking about ten years prior, through the London Missionary Society's appointment of William Lockhart, for the most part, medical services were not extended to women. Sex segregation consequently restricted women from seeking medical care from men. After writing a letter expressing her desire to open a hospital to serve native Chinese women, the Philadelphia branch of the WFMS congregated at the General Executive Committee meeting in May 1874. During their meeting, they agreed to set aside a $2000 fund toward the establishment of a hospital for women and children in Peking. The land on which the hospital and residence building would be built was procured in December 1874. The first patient treated in the Peking Woman's Hospital was a Chinese woman who had fallen and sustained a foot injury. After treating her, Combs recalled that the family was very grateful to her. In the five months following its completion in November 1875, the hospital received 18 patients. Founding the first women's hospital in China gave Combs a platform to advocate for medical training and education for women and for the improvement of sanitary and hygiene practiced in relevant medical facilities. Although hesitant at first, the Chinese population in Peking soon came to appreciate the medical help provided by a female physician. = Community care = During the building of the hospital, Combs served the Chinese women in their homes while learning and mastering the language. She made 198 home visits throughout her first year and treated 37 patients, some over several weeks. In her first year, she prescribed for 314 cases. In addition to providing medical care, Combs made an effort to convert the women whom she served to Christianity. Her marriage to Andrew Strittmater led to her relocation to Jiujiang. There, Combs took on the work of a physician and missionary, Miss Mason, who was leading the medical work in Jiujiang but had returned to the United States after becoming very ill. Combs treated countless patients in Jiujiang as well in addition to many cases in the outskirts of the city. Combs's medical experience and skill helped ease the transition of leadership following Miss Mason's quick illness.  Later life and death  \\"A View in Peking\\" in 1877 from Rev. I. W. Wiley's account of his travels in China and Japan 1877– 1878. Combs accompanied Wiley from Peking to Shanghai where she was married. Combs met Andrew Stritmatter aboard a ship of missionaries that departed for China in 1873. As her five-year contract with the WFMS came to a close, Combs and Stritmatter were married in Shanghai on November 19, 1877, by Bishop I. W. Wiley. Soon after their marriage, the couple moved to the southern part of China to a place known as Jiujiang. Although her marriage resulted in the end of her commission to the WFMS, Combs continued to practice medicine in her new location. The couple had two sons named Edward and Albert, both born in China.Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Provo, UT, US: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2004. About two years after their relocation, Stritmatter contracted tuberculosis which led the couple to begin the journey back to the United States in October 1880. The long journey resulted in Stritmatter's untimely death one month later in Denver, Colorado. He died before arriving at his family home in Ohio. Combs remained in Colorado following her husband's death to raise her two children and continue practicing medicine. She never remarried. After practicing medicine in Denver for six years, Combs moved to Columbus, Ohio to be close to her late husband's family and to spend the remainder of her days.Ancestry.com. U.S. City Directories, 1822-1995 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, US: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2011. She died in her son's home on April 23, 1919, in Franklin County, Ohio at the age of 68 years old.Ancestry.com and Ohio Department of Health. Ohio, Death Records, 1908-1932, 1938-2007 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, US: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2010. She was buried at Union Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio. Legacy Three months prior to her marriage, Combs was joined at her mission station by Leonora King. The pair of physicians worked alongside each other for three months before Combs relocated to Jiujiang with her husband. King consequently took over her responsibilities as the primary physician at the Woman's hospital. In 1879, Leonora King successfully treated the wife of Li Hongzhang, Viceroy of the province of Chih-li. The connection between King and the powerful family of the Viceroy resulted in the funding and construction of a surgery unit and medical dispensary.  Publications  Combs published many works during her studies and throughout her medical career. During her time at Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, she published a 22-page handwritten thesis on the study of medical hysteria. Additionally, she wrote several pieces for the Women's Missionary Methodist Episcopal Church monthly newspaper called The Heathen Woman's Friend. In this, Combs published three distinct works describing her life as a missionary titled: \\"A Bright Day at the Peking Hospital\\", \\"The Peking Hospital\\", and \\"A Morning's Visit at the Peking Hospital\\".

It has been held by the Frick Collection in New York since 1950, and is the only painting by Cimabue in the US. The Frick Collection acquired the painting from the Knoedler gallery in Paris in 1950. Previously, it had been owned by the antiques dealer M Rolla at the end of the 19th century, inherited by G Rolla, and then sold to the art dealer Eduardo Moratilla., Frick Collection The painting depicts the flagellation of Christ, an episode in the Passion. In the painting, Christ, naked but for a loincloth, is bound to a marble column that rises up the centre of the scene, dividing it into two halves. He is being flogged by two figures, one to either side, in clothing of jarringly cheerful colours. The anguished Christ regards the viewer calmly. Tall city buildings in the background are depicted with Byzantine reverse perspective frame the scene. The figure of Christ is heavily influenced by that in Cimabue's Santa Croce Crucifix, whilst the torturers in bright clothing recall the Siennese school and the stylised background buildings the Roman school, the latter influence already taken on by Cimabue's workshop in the Lives of the Apostles in the Upper Basilica at Assisi.AA.VV., Paintings in The Frick Collection: French, Italian and Spanish. Volume II, The Frick Collection, New York 1968. The panel measures . It is one of three panels known from the Diptych of Devotion, a polyptych depicting the passion of Christ, which probably had two wings each with four panels, eight in all. The physical condition of the paint at the edges of Flagellation of Christ panel indicate that it was at the lower-right corner of a larger composite work. Two other scenes by Cimabue, painted on wood panels of similar size, have been identified as parts of the same polyptych: Virgin and Child with Two Angels in the collections of the National Gallery in London (discovered in Suffolk in 2000) and Christ Mocked, discovered in France in 2019. Attribution of the work has been problematic since it came to the attention of art historians in the 1950s. It was initially attributed it to another Sienese artist Duccio, but others suggested Cimabue or his workshop. The uncertainty was resolved after the discovery and attribution of the similarly-size Virgin and Child with Two Angels, definitively attributed to Cimabue, which led to a reattribution of the Flagellation of Christ from Duccio to Cimabue. The two panels were exhibited together in Pisa and London in 2005, and at the Frick Collection in 2006. A third panel, Christ Mocked, was found in France in 2019, and auctioned for €24 million.

(1890–1974) was a Scottish-born Australian stained-glass designer and modernist painter who challenged conservative tastes in Australian art.  Early life and education  = Scotland = William Frater was born on 31 January 1890 at Ochiltree Castle, near Linlithgow in West Lothian in Scotland. His father was forester William Frater (1863–1893) and mother Sarah Boyd (née Manson) a farm servant (1857–1900). After his father died from typhoid, and his mother from gastroenteritis, Frater and his three siblings were brought up by his paternal grandmother Ann and uncle Andrew who lived in neighbouring houses at West Ochiltree Farm. Frater gained his Merit Certificate at Bridgend School, Auldhill Road, West Lothian in 1903, and attended Kingscavil Public School in 1904, then studied art at the Linlithgow Academy in 1905 before taking up a three-year apprenticeship in 1905 in the Oscar Paterson glass studio in Glasgow. = Australia = Frater won the Glasgow School of Art Haldane Scholarship for drawing in 1906 and studied in the craft and stained glass workshops. However his uncle, fearing a penniless future for his nephew, prevented his entry into the final year to take painting, and Frater left the school 1909, migrating on the liner Norseman to Melbourne in September 1910 with brother Tom, who continued n to Sydney. His application to the National Gallery School of Art was rejected by Bernard Hall (1859–1935), and instead he found employment as overseer of stained-glass design at Brooks, Robinson & Co. Ltd on a five-year contract. He enrolled in the Victorian Artists' Society life class but his behaviour had him ejected. Affronted, he impulsively returned to Britain on the Orama in May 1912 after only five months, and completed his training at Glasgow in the senior painting classes at the School of Art under Greiffenhagen and Anning Bell. In July 1913 he returned to Melbourne and in 1915 married tailor Winifred (Winnie) Dow (1888–1974), who had modelled for him before his return to Scotland,L. J. Course, 'Frater, William (1890–1974)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1981, accessed online 17 December 2019 and they took up residence in Alphington. They had six children; a stillborn female (1915); Arthur, a manufacturer (1916–1998); John, a carpenter/builder (1920–2004); Barbara Dare, an actor and office worker (1924–2000); and twins, musician William (Bill) (1931–2009) and scientist Robin (1931–2014). Like other red-headed Scots, Frater was nicknamed 'Jock' in his adopted country.  Career  Wesley Church, Melbourne, exterior = Stained glass = Frater resumed his earlier position with Brooks, Robinson, then was employed by E. L. Yencken & Co. Pty Ltd to design the west window of Wesley Church, Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, which he regarded as his most significant design, and other commissions including windows of Kyabram Wesley Evangelical Methodist Church, St Stephen's Angligan Heritage Church, Wynyard, Tasmana and Birregurra Christ Church. Frater attempted to introduce his Glasgow Arts & Crafts training into his renditions of The Light of the World in the 1930s in glass at Holy Trinity Anglican, Oakleigh and St. Andrew's Presbyterian, Mansfield, but was confined by commercial considerations, so that while recognisable as The Light of the World, they lacked the symbolism of Hunt's painting of the subject and the Arts & Crafts ethos.Hughes, B. E. (2019). New Light on the Light of the World. Australasian Journal of Victorian Studies, 22(2), 96-116. At Yencken he mentored teenage apprentice Alan Sumner for fifteen years, encouraging his painting ambitions, and made a lifelong friend in Arnold Shore, also a stained-glass designer, and they continued to paint and exhibit in their spare time. = Tonalism = Between 1915 and 1920 Frater simplified his composition and design, based on his stained glass experience. For a time in his earlier painting interest in the classical seventeenth century painters interacted with his adoption of the analytical tonalism of Max MeldrumMcGuire, M. A. (1986). ‘Life and your Imagining’ The Art of Clarice Beckett. Australian Journal of Art, 5(1), 90-103. in figure and portrait paintings including The artist's wife reading (1915) and Portrait of artist's wife (1919). In a 1961 interview with Hazel de Berg, Frater recorded his interactions with Meldrum: > Anyhow, I arrived back here...some months before the 1914 war broke out. Max > Meldrum had come back here meanwhile, he had been abroad many years in > France, and we had terrific arguments. Max would have nothing later than > Manet, and the Impressionists he was not at all interested in. Really I > think it was through my arguing and discussing with Max that was the > beginning of what they called modern art here. Max was so dogmatic...and his > conception of tone was just black and white really, and this idea of tone as > colour, later in the early twenties, when I became aware of Cézanne, tone > became not just light and shade, but tone values had colour values as well, > so that was the great discovery, really, that I personally made... = Post-impressionism = He experimented with Cézannesque modernist colour over the next decade,A. V. Cook, '100 years of Australian art', The Age (Melbourne) Sat 16 Oct 1954 Page 53 during which he led and taught a group of Australian modernists, making trips to the countryside outside Melbourne on weekends to paint in the plein air tradition of the Barbizon school. With associates Horace Brandt, Pat Harford and Isabel Tweddle, they constituted a post-Impressionist school of painting in Melbourne. His first solo exhibition was at the Athenaeum, Melbourne in May 1923, and he exhibited there with the Twenty Melbourne Painters from the late 1920s, and the Contemporary Group of Melbourne in the 1930s. In a lecture he publicly challenged the anti-modernist stance that National Gallery School director Bernard Hall had expressed in his previous lecture. Frater was characterised in a 1933 Art in Australia article as a stereotypical Scot; > ...dogged and tenacious, strong in pride of race, reliant and confident in > self, a hard man to talk down and a hard man to shake in his beliefs, which > change and mature slowly. A dogmatic man, if you like, but a purposeful one > and, like Cézanne whom he acclaims, a rugged type with a scorn of frills and > unmasculine prettiness—all of which may be discovered in his work. = Darebin = In 1936 Frater visited a flat in South Yarra owned by well-to- do Lina Bryans (née Hallenstein in Germany) to advise her on stained-glass windows, and painted her portrait. With his help and encouragement she decided to become an artist, producing her first works early in 1937, from which Basil Burdett (1897–1942) selected her Backyards, South Yarra for the 'Herald Exhibition of Outstanding Pictures of 1937.'https://www.daao.org.au/bio/lina- bryans/biography/ One of Frater's best known works is The Red Hat, a portrait of Bryans dating from that year. She, using her inheritance, purchased Ambrose Hallen's former hotel-cum-studio at 899 Heidelberg Road, Darebin in which Ada May Plante had been living, and with her painted and decorated it distinctively, naming it \\"The Pink Hotel\\".Bryans, Lina (1986). The Pink Hotel. -Interview with artist Lina Bryans by Valerie Albiston-. In This Australia. 5 (4), 32-37. Over the next decade Frater and she lived and painted there together after his separation from Winifred.Sarah Thomas, review of in Australian Book Review, Issues 248-257, 2003, Page 40 The artists' colony included Plante, Hallen, Ian Fairweather, Arnold Shore and other artists, and attracted a group of writers associated with the journal Meanjin. Part of their circle were Nina and Clem Christesen whose 'Stanhope' in Eltham they frequented. Bryans sold the Darebin property in 1948, moving to Harkaway, near Berwick, then overseas in 1953. = Ascendancy = In accordance with government war directives, the Yencken firm closed down the his department in 1940 and Frater retired from stained-glass designing and, subsisting on his teaching, devoted himself to landscapes. He regarded a \\"certain strangeness\\", in his art in response to The Australian landscape as an essential attribute of great art. He exhibited at the Contemporary Art Society, and in solo shows at Georges Gallery, Melbourne, and the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, in 1946, expanding his subject matter with visits sponsored by the airline TAA to Central Australia in 1950 and Port Douglas in 1952. From 1959–1964 Frater was a painting tutor at Melbourne Technical College. He exhibited at Australian Galleries, Melbourne in 1958 and the Victorian Artists' Society in 1963, from which date he became president of the Society until 1972, exhibiting annually with them.Christesen, C. B. (1970). The Gallery on Eastern Hill: The Victorian Artists Society Centenary. publ. Victorian Artists' Society. Its main exhibition space was named Frater Gallery. In 1967, in the midst of the Vietnam War Frater joined in solidarity a controversial pacifist exhibition of the Victorian Branch of the Contemporary Art Society at Melbourne's Argus Gallery, traveling to Adelaide under the aegis of the South Australian Campaign for Peace in Vietnam. Frater was given a retrospective at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1966 and a final exhibition in July 1973. His work is represented in galleries and private collections throughout Australia as well as the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow.

During the painter's period of adherence to tonalism, the reviewer of a 1919 Athenaeum showing of the Twenty Melbourne Painters group picked out Frater as \\"a gloomy enemy of light and gaiety who reports the weather with a stain on its character.\\" The Bulletin of 29 May 1957 briefly reviewed the Victorian Artists’ Society’s autumn show incorporating the E.

Cezanne still stalks through his painting as he did through most of > Frater’s and Bell’s contemporaries. It is interesting to see how well this > can stand up to very changed sensibilities.

In a 1979 interview with James Gleeson, Albert Tucker confesses that when he \\"heard about people like George Bell and Jock Frater and Cezanne...I had this sudden extreme and rapid expansion of consciousness and vision around the middle to late thirties. It probably corresponded with a growth period for me. I had a sudden enormous expansion of horizons and possibilities.

Grant has been widely acclaimed by his contemporaries and historians as exceptional. Ulysses S. Grant was a commanding general during the Civil War and a two-term U.S. President. Born in Ohio near the Ohio River, Grant grew up around horses, which he came to admire and love, possessing a natural affinity, allowing him to ride, train and manage horses at an early age. His father Jesse placed much confidence in his ability and gave him tasks involving horses that were rarely ever expected of a youth. At age five he was noted for doing difficult stunts bareback and soon after was also performing responsible chores, hauling timber, and driving teams of horses for long distances by himself. From boyhood through his military career, Grant had a well established reputation for training and managing horses. As a youth, neighbors would have him train hard to manage horses. As a cadet he set a high-jump record at West Point that stood for a quarter-century. Horses played an important role throughout Grant's military career, carrying him with dispatches, going about inspecting and encouraging troops and taking him into battle, sometimes having his horse shot from underneath him. During his lifetime he mostly owned and rode large and powerful horses that often could not be mounted by anyone else. Noted for his love of and ability to ride and manage horses, Grant at times would receive as gifts the best horses available from friends and admirers. Youth Headley, 1869, p. 22 Grant's first experience on horseback occurred at a circus that was visiting Georgetown when he was two years old. Watching the horses in the ring, Ulysses asked his parents if he could sit atop one of the ponies and ride it, to which his parents acquiesced. It was a happy event for the boy as he rode around the ring shrieking with laughter, not wanting to get off. This was also the first time he showed signs of natural riding ability.Dowdall, 2012, p. 3 When Grant was little more than a toddler he was often found out by his father's shop with the teams of horses, restlessly crawling and playing about their legs and swinging from their tails. On one of several such occasions a worried neighbor once noted this activity and exclaimed to his mother, Hannah, \\"Mrs. Grant, do you know where your boy is? He is out there swinging on the tails of Loudon's horses!\\" Calmly, Hannah would typically reply, \\"horses seem to understand Ulysses\\".Garland, 1898, p. 6Smith, 2001, p. 23 The young Grant was always on hand and eager for any work which involved riding a horse or driving a team of horses.Garland, 1898, p. 9 At the age of five, he proved to be a skilled rider and something of a daredevil on horseback. Riding at a fast pace, he would stand on one leg while holding the reins, maintaining his balance as the horse galloped about–a feat that amazed his onlookers.Chernow, 2017, pp. 13-14 At age seven, while his father was away for the day, young Grant harnessed a restless three-year old colt, which had never been broken except to the saddle, to a sleigh, and drove the young horse about, hauling loads of brushwood throughout the day. Upon his father's return he discovered that after his son managed to bridle and harness the colt, he had amassed \\"a pile of brush as big as a cabin\\" all by himself. White, 2016, p. 18 When Grant was eleven he established a reputation among his peers and neighbors by riding a trick pony belonging to the circus that came to town. The pony had been trained to throw off anyone who attempted to mount him. After several other boys tried and failed the young Grant came forward and said, \\"I believe I can ride that pony\\". He mounted the restless animal, having no reins and its mane cut short, and wrapped his arms firmly around its neck. After a frantic effort to buck him off, the pony finally abated where Ulysses, rode the pony around the ring for a couple of minutes, earning himself a rounding applause from the spectators and the five-dollar prize promised to anyone who could stay with the pony.Garland, 1898, p. 13White, 2016, pp. 18–19 Ulysses' father Jesse Grant held regard for horses that was pragmatic. As a tanner and leather goods merchant, horses to him were simply beasts of burden and a potential source for hides. By contrast Ulysses viewed them as wonderful individuals, each with their own temperament. He was able to size up any horse he was working with, and possessed a temperament of his own that allowed him to best employ any given horse.McFeely, 1981, p. 10 Jesse began assigning various chores which required horses to Ulysses by the time he was eight years old. He soon became a proficient teamster working all day, every day, hauling wood or bark. At ten Ulysses would drive a pair of horses, by himself, from his home in Georgetown to Cincinnati, forty miles away, bringing home a load of passengers. His father did not insist on his working about the barkmill, provided there was other available work and often entrusted Ulysses with a team of horses on his own. He also allowed Ulysses to manage the horses on the farm and participate in the farming.Garland, 1898, p. 10Brisbin,1868, p. 27 At age twelve, Grant's father sent him into the forest with a team of horses and a wagon to pick up a load of timber. The men at the lumber camp were supposed to load the wagon, but were nowhere to be found when Ulysses arrived. Not wanting to go back empty handed, Ulysses devised a method by hitching the logs and pulling them aboard the wagon one at a time by use of the horses. After securing the load, Ulysses hitched up the team back to the wagon and returned home, much to the amazement of his father.Chernow, 2017, p. 14 Biographer James McClure describes how the young Ulysses' \\"exhibited a remarkable self possession of mind\\" on an occasion when he was transporting two women in a two-horse wagon across a creek swollen from a heavy rain where he found the water level much deeper than usual. Upon crossing, he suddenly found the water to be so deep that the horses were almost swimming, while the water was up to the deck level of the wagon. The women became greatly alarmed and began to scream, but the young Grant, though in a very precarious situation, kept his calm, simply looked over his shoulder and assured the ladies by saying, \\" Don't speak I will take you through safe\\", and continued on undaunted without further incident.McClure, 1879, p. 32 When about nine years old, the young Grant had acquired such a reputation for fast riding and stunts that jockeys who had steeds suffering from what was called “a distemper,” would bring their animals to Georgetown for Grant to ride them hard and fast, a technique that was known bring the horse's body temperature up, curing the illness. Local farmers would also bring their problem horses for him to train. These challenges delighted the boy thoroughly.Richardson, 1868, pp. 55-56 Pulitzer Prize winning biographer Hamlin Garland commented that Grant had a \\"mysterious\\" ability to communicate with horses, \\"He could train a horse to trot, rack, or pace, apparently at will\\".Garland, 1898, p. 23 Grant, reflecting on his youthful experiences with horses, would later write in his Personal Memoirs: Military Engraving of Ulysses S. Grant in General's uniform Grant also gained a reputation for excellent horsemanship during his military career,Brisbin, 1868, p. 62Dowdall, 2012, p. 24 and subsequently would sometimes receive horses as gifts from admirers.Dowdall, 2012, pp. 96, 99 In the Mexican-American War he performed remarkable feats on horseback during battle. During the American Civil War Grant owned several horses, riding them on scouting missions, while inspecting the troops and formations, and during battle. At times he would retire one horse and use another during long campaigns. Grant was known to take exceptional care of his mounts and always kept them brushed \\"smooth as silk\\" with all the trappings in perfect order.Garland, 1898, p. 293 A war correspondent having often observed Grant's self-styled horsemanship once characterized his overall military involvement with horses: \\"Roads are almost useless to him, for he takes short cuts through fields and woods, and will swim his horse through almost any stream that obstructs his way. Nor does it make any difference to him whether he has daylight for his movements, for he will ride from breakfast until two o'clock in the morning, and that too without eating. The next day he will repeat the dose, until he finishes his work.\\"Brisbin, 1868, p. 288 =West Point= At the age of 17, Grant was nominated to attend West Point in the spring of 1839. After being accepted, he made his way across Pennsylvania to New York City and traveled up the Hudson River to West Point, arriving there and signing the register on May 29.White, 2016, p. 25Simpson, 2000, p.10–11 There he soon surpassed all the cadets at the academy in horsemanship.Fuller, 1929, p. 68 Among the horses at the academy was a dark bay horse that was so untamable that it was about to be condemned. Grant selected this beast for his horse. Every day he would devote time to it, bridling, mounting and riding it about with ease, while the entire class would watch and admire in amazement his excellent command of this horse. Horsemanship was an important part of the curriculum at West Point. In June 1843 the cadets assembled in the riding hall during their final graduating exercises, where all members performed their riding exercises before the Superintendent, Richard Delafield, and a large assembly of spectators. The academy riding master Henry Hershberger, approached the high-jump bar, raised it another foot, higher than an average man's head, and then called out, \\"Cadet Grant\\", prompting a low murmer of wonderment from among the crowd. From among the cadets, all mounted on their horses, Grant sprang forward, riding a large and powerful chestnut mount. The cadets all recognized the horse, York, who no one else was able to ride. Grant moved to the far end of the hall, and as he turned his mount towards the bar silence fell over the crowd. He dashed forward, gauging his pace, and with a great leap, horse and rider cleared the bar with apparent ease. Hershberg cried out, \\"very well done, sir\\", as the assembly filled the riding hall with the sound of applause.White, 2016, p. 43 Grant had set a high-jump record at West Point that stood for twenty-five years.Chernow 2017, pp. 24, 27Smith 2001, p. 28.Simpson, 2000, p. 17 Grant's personal biographer Albert D. Richardson said of Grant's horsemanship: \\"There was nothing he could not ride. He commanded, sat, and jumped a horse with singular ease and grace; was seen to the best advantage when mounted and at a full gallop ; could perform more feats than any other member of his class, and was, altogether, one of the very best riders West Point had ever known.\\"Richardson, 1868, p. 92 Grant's classmate, the future Confederate General, James Longstreet, said of Grant that, \\"In horsemanship, however, he was noted as the most proficient in the Academy. In fact, rider and horse held together like the fabled centaur...\\"Ulysses S. Grant Homepage, Essay and that he was \\"the most daring horseman in the academy\\". General Rufus Ingalls later recalled that when an unruly or stubborn horse was added to the string of academy horses Grant was always called upon to subdue it.Catton, 1968, p.24 After graduation, Grant naturally requested service in the cavalry, but despite his excellent horsemanship, there was no opening available and instead was assigned to the 4th Infantry Regiment, his second choice.Smith, 2001, p. 28 =Mexican- American War= During the Mexican-American War Grant expressed his amazement of the great herds of wild mustangs roaming between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers, moving about like buffalo in a continuous mass. \\"The country was a rolling prairie, and from the higher ground the vision was obstructed only by the earth's curvature.\\" Grant estimated that to corral a herd of this size, an area the size of the state of Delaware would be required.Smith, 2001, p. 41 Grant at this time was appointed Quartermaster of his regiment in August, 1846. Because of his organizational skills and ability with horses and managing teams of horses, he was put in charge of the mule teams used by the Army. Longing to participate in battle and share in its dangers, Grant found such an assignment beneath his ability and respectfully submitted a protest to this effect to his colonel, which was denied.Brands, 2012, p. 35 His new assignment involved loading and packing the mules correctly and efficiently, and keeping abreast of their overall well being. For every eight soldiers there was one pack mule where Grant would have to inspect and manage up to fifty mules, along with five mule wagon teams. To assist in this huge task and responsibility Grant would hire local Mexican mule handlers, who were more familiar with handling Mexican mules, different in their habits from those bred in America, that the Army had purchased while in Mexico.Dowdall, 2012, p. 36 When a volunteer was needed to carry an important dispatch for reinforcements, Grant came forward and demonstrated his equestrian ability at the Battle of Monterrey by carrying the dispatch past snipers while hanging off the side of his horse at a fast gallop, keeping the animal between him and potential fire. Before leaving the city he stopped at a house in American hands and assured some wounded Americans, he would send for help.McFeely, 1981, pp. 33–34Brands, 2012, p. 37 =Civil War= General Grant and his horse, Cincinnati When the Civil War broke out, Grant was working at his father's leather shop in Galena, Illinois. With his home next to the shop Grant had no need for a horse, and did not own one at the time.Dowdall, 2012, p. 62 During the war Grant owned and rode more than ten different horses, including Cincinnati, Claybank, Egypt, Fox, Jack, Jeff Davis, Kangaroo, Little Reb, Methuselah and Rodney.Armistead, 2013, p. 104 Grant was appointed colonel of the Twenty-first Illinois Volunteer Infantry on June 14, 1861, at which time he purchased a horse while still in Galena. It was a strong horse, but while Grant was leading his regiment from Springfield, Illinois, to Missouri the mount proved to be unfit for military duty. While encamped on the Illinois River for a few days a local farmer brought in a cream colored stallion of considerable value. High spirited, very intelligent, the horse, named Jack, proved to be an excellent mount for long marches, but lacked tenacity and responsiveness in battle, to which Grant referred to him as \\"Old Nuisance\\". The horse was striking in appearance, with its silver mane and tail, and dark eyes. Grant often rode this mount during the campaigns of 1862-1863, and kept him as an extra horse for ceremonial purposes. This was the horse that carried Grant away from Admiral Foote's riverboat the night before the attack on Fort Donelson; the same horse that endured difficult scouting missions in the Tennessee mud before and during the Battle of Shiloh. Grant rode Jack through the Cumberland to the Battle of Chattanooga. After Chattanooga Grant was called away and retired the horse to his business advisor, J.R. Jones in Northern Illinois, for his personal use.Dowdall, 2012, pp. 69-70 During this time Grant purchased a second horse, called Fox, a powerful and spirited animal with exceptional endurance, which he also rode during the siege and battles around Fort Donelson and also at Shiloh. On August 5, 1861 Grant was appointed Brigadier General of volunteers. Soon after he purchased a pony for his son, Frederick Grant who was with him at the time, along with another horse for field service for himself. At the Battle of Belmont, Grant's first battle in the Civil War, his horse was killed under him where he was compelled to use his son's pony. This horse proved to be unfit for battle, so he turned it over to Captain William S. Hillyer, his aide, when he offered Grant his horse.White, 2016, p. 170 The Union advance had scattered the Confederates away from Camp Johnston, but the Confederates soon regrouped and began to surround the Union troops. Some officers were considering surrender, but Grant was all about on his horse reassuring and reorganizing his troops. During the final retreat, Grant narrowly escaped on his horse by leading it down a steep riverbank. Grant recalled, \\"my horse put its fore feet over the bank without hesitation or urging, and, with his hind feet well under him, slid down the bank and trotted aboard the boat, twelve or fifteen feet away, over a single gang-plank.\\"White, 2016, p. 172 Photograph of three of Grant's horses during the Overland Campaign (Cold Harbor, Virginia), from left to right: Egypt, Cincinnati, and Jeff Davis Cincinnati was a bay, said to have been high and was a son of Lexington, a horse owned by William Tecumseh Sherman, considered to be the fastest thoroughbred in the United States at that time. Grant considered Cincinnati \\"the finest horse I have ever seen.Armistead, 2013, p. 125 Grant, on rare occasions, only allowed two other people to ever ride Cincinnati, one of whom was Abraham Lincoln.Dowdall, 2012, p. 105 Of Lincoln, Grant once said, \\"Lincoln spent the latter days of his life with me. He came to City Point in the last month of the war and was with me all the time. He was a fine horseman and rode my horse Cincinnati every day.\\" In October, 1862, a month before the siege of Vicksburg got underway, Grant sent his horse Jack to Illinois for a month's rest.Dowdall, 2012, p. 79 During the Vicksburg Campaign Grant acquired another horse captured by a raiding party at a plantation in Mississippi. Grant had the opportunity to ride the animal and found it had a \\"delightful\\" gait. Grant purchased the horse from the Army and named it Jeff Davis. He rode it instead of Cincinnati when there was long journeys to be made, because of its surefootedness and ability to stay fresh.Dowdall, 2012, p. 114 Shortly after the Vicksburg campaign, Grant suffered his most serious horse related injury while visiting General Banks in New Orleans. According to Grant's account of the incident, the horse he was using was \\"vicious and but little used\\", and while he was reviewing Bank's troops, a locomotive in the street sounded its whistle, causing the horse to take flight. It stumbled and fell upon Grant's leg, causing him to be \\"rendered insensible\\", and unconscious. He awoke in a hotel with several doctors looking over him. His leg was swollen from the knee to his thigh. Grant described the pain as \\"almost beyond endurance\\". He was bedridden for over a week, unable to even turn over by himself. He was later put upon a steamer and taken back up the Mississippi to Vicksburg where it was some time before he was able to move about on his own.Armistead, 2013, p. 36 In December 1863 while still in Chattanooga, Grant was given a fine Kentucky thoroughbred as a gift by the citizens of Egypt, Illinois, organized by Orval Pool, who all knew Grant was in need of a new horse when he had retired Jack, his previous horse. Grant wrote a letter of thanks to the citizens, and named his new gift horse Egypt in their honor. At seven years old, Egypt was an exceptionally handsome dark bay who measured . The horse proved invaluable in the months to come, as Grant traveled over the Cumberland Mountains in January, covered with snow and ice, and was used throughout the Overland Campaign in Virginia.Dowdall, 2012, pp. 96-97, 119 At the surrender at Appomattox Grant met with General Lee at the picket lines between the armies. There the two generals sat on their horses for hours, Grant astride Cincinnati, and Lee on Traveller, and discussed the terms of surrender and the condition of the South in sight of their soldiers. Before departing Lee requested that his officers be permitted to leave with their horses. Grant, having farmed with horses and knowing many of the Confederate officers were small farmers, allowed them to return home with their horses, swords, and their honor.Badeau, 1887, pp. 20–21Smith, 2001, p.405White, 2016, p. 406 Presidency Ulysses S. Grant MemorialMonument to Grant astride Cincinnati at Washington DC. The monument, 39 feet high, is the second largest equestrian statue in the United StatesGoode, 1974, pp. 244–246 See also: Image of entire monument When Grant became president in 1869, three of his horses, Cincinnati, Jeff Davis and Egypt were brought to the White House stables. According to Albert Hawkins, the stable master at the capitol at that time, Grant, during his second term, arranged for a statue of him mounted on Cincinnati. For almost a month the General would have the bridle and saddle put on Cincinnati and ride out to meet the sculptor daily. Hawkins also noted that Grant's other horse, Jeff Davis, was a kicker and had the habit of biting when the stable hands got close to him. Yet Grant, without any trouble was able to handle him the moment he entered the stable. The horse would lay his ears back and move about restlessly until Grant approached him, calming the animal with a few simple pats on the back.Grant, Frederick Dent, Memoirs Grant, refusing an offer of $10,000 for Cincinnati, brought the horse with him when he became president and moved to Washington DC. In 1878, the horse died at the home of Admiral Ammen. Nearly all depictions of Grant on horseback in drawings, granite, and bronze, are astride Cincinnati including the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial, in Washington, D.C. After the Civil War Grant had gained possession of White Haven, previously owned by his wife's father Frederick Tracy Dent. While he was president Grant transformed the estate into a successful horse breeding farm and designed its large horse stable. Completed in 1871, the stable was large enough to house 25 horses. All Grant's horses were either received as gifts or purchased by Grant. He mostly owned Thoroughbred and Morgan horses, but also enjoyed raising other breeds.Chernow, 2017, p. 618National Park Service, Essay, 2019 Grant would not race his horses, never attended such events, and thought the practice of horse racing for amusement was cruel to the animal.Coolidge, 1917, p. 10 Grant was once arrested for driving a horse and carriage too fast along M Street in Washington DC. The officer, one of Washington's new African-American policemen, was shocked when he discovered who he had detained, but Grant was more impressed than angered and said, \\"Officer, do your duty\\", smiled and walked home while the policeman brought the horse and rig to the police station.Sports Magazine, August 13, 1958, Essay World tour Shortly after his presidency in 1877, Grant and his wife Julia embarked on a tour around the world. In March the Grants were visiting Constantinople and Greece. While visiting with Sultan Abdul Hamid II, Grant was very impressed with his stable of purebred Arabian horses. Grant commented that the stallions would \\"pick up their feet like a cat, and so quickly, that no one can scarcely follow their motions\\". Impressed by Grant's praise for the stallions, the Sultan allowed him to pick out any two he desired and take them home. Grant chose a \\"dappled gray\\" and an \\"iron gray\\", which he shipped back to New York.Chernow, 2017, p. 872White, 2016, p. 601 In the spring of 1878, while in Italy, the Grants were touring Milan. Grant was conducting an honorary review of the Bersaglieri, the pride of the Italian Army and well known for their horsemanship. At the time Alfred M. Fuller, an ex-Union Captain in the cavalry during the Civil War happened to be visiting there also. He was well familiar with Grant's horsemanship, which Fuller enthusiastically brought to the attention of the Bersaglieri officers who were accompanying the Grant party. Subsequently, they brought a restless steed to present to Grant which had to be restrained by three other officers. The frantic and powerful animal appeared as if it could break loose at any given moment. Grant approached the young and untamable horse that never had been ridden, with astonishment and admiration, while some of the young officers smiled as if they were intentionally setting up Grant with a horse they assumed would throw him off in short order. As Grant slowly mounted the animal he took hold of the reins and assumed a perfectly erect posture. The horse immediately made several attempts to throw him off, and then, unpredictably, gently trotted forward knowing that it had met its master, at which time Grant received a spontaneous applause. Fuller recalls at that time, \\"horse and rider were as one being\\", as Grant rode the mount for two hours. When Grant returned to the hotel he looked perfectly relaxed while the officers that oversaw the affair looked completely fatigued.Fuller: McClure's Magazine, 1896-1897, Vol. VIII, p. 501 Funeral After his prolonged ordeal with throat cancer, while writing his memoirs, Ulysses S. Grant, on July 23, 1885, finally died at the age of 63. On August 8 his coffin was placed on a catafalque draped in black with plumes at each corner where twenty-four black stallions, arranged in twelve pairs, pulled Grant's hearse along Broadway in New York City, while twenty generals led by General Winfield Scott Hancock, astride a black stallion, led the entourage and team of horses.Chernow, 2017, pp. 955-956White, 2016, p. 654 { edit summary  A painting of Grant on his horse, Cincinnati, inside the dome of Grant's tomb } See also * List of horses of the American Civil War * Horses in warfare * Glossary of equestrian terms * Bibliography of Ulysses S.

The camp was based in the North Island town of Otaki, New Zealand. The camp closed in June 2018. Temporary health camps were organised during World War I and through to the 1930s under the guidance of Elizabeth Gunn (paediatrician). The camps were part of the wider health system's attempts in tackling malnutrition. Children would bathe, make their beds, have lessons, swim and exercise and have sunbathing sessions. Children were served several portions of healthy simple food to ensure they returned home in a healthier state than in which they arrived.  History  New Zealand stamp (1983) including fees directed to Health Camps The Ōtaki Health Camp was opened in 1932 by a Wellington children's charity, with government support. Entrepreneur and land owner, Byron Brown, gave the land for the children's camp and the first camp buildings went up and remain there today. Its aim was to make city children more healthy and robust. It was sited in Ōtaki so children could benefit from ample sunshine and beach-orientated play. In 1936 a national federation was set up to oversee the operation of all the camps. Funding was received from central government and also from the sale of specially issued postage stamps. By the 1970s funding began to dry up, debt mounted and building facilities became outdated. By the mid-1990s, the camps could afford to take only about half of all children eligible for treatment.  Closure  The government stepped away from the camps in 2001, handing them over to a new charitable organisation, STAND Children's Services/Tu Maia Whanau which was contracted to Oranga Tamariki. In 2018 the camp closed due to a lack of funding.

He was listed as one of 24 honored founding officials of Tang Dynasty at Lingyan Pavilion. In history Liu Hongji is son of Liu Sheng, a governor of Hezhou prefecture in Sui Dynasty. He was drafted to the military service during Emperor Yang of Sui's campaigns against Goguryeo, but he was late for the duty, which might lead to a death penalty. He thus intentionally killed a farmer's cow, which was a civil non-death felony. He was arrested for killing the cow by the local government and imprisoned, and avoided the death row. Old Book of Tang: 弘基少落拓，交通轻侠，不事家产，以父荫为右勋侍。大业末，尝从炀帝征辽东，家贫不能自致，行至汾阴，度已后期当斩，计无所出，遂与同旅屠牛，潜讽吏捕之，系于县狱，岁余，竟以赎论。 After being released after one year, he became a horse thief. Later, he met Li Shimin, the future Emperor Taizong of Tang, and became Li's close friend. Old Book of Tang: 事解亡命，盗马以供衣食，因至太原。会高祖镇太原，遂自结托，又察太宗有非常之度，尤委心焉。由是大蒙亲礼，出则连骑，入同卧起。 When Li Yuan (Li Shimin's father and future founding emperor of Tang Dynasty) decided to rebel against Sui in 617, Liu Hongji and Zhangsun Shunde ambushed and killed Wang Wei and Gao Junya, the two deputy officials of Taiyuan who helped Emperor Yang of Sui spy on Li Yuan, and made it possible for Li Yuan to rebel in Taiyuan.

Then, he led his men captured Fufeng, a town west of Daxing, and finished the encirclement around Daxing. Wei Wensheng, the Sui general guarding the Daxing area, was defeated by Liu Hongji's force at the Jinguang Gate of Daxing city. After Li Yuan captured Daxing and formally established the Tang Dynasty, Liu Hongji was honored for his outstanding contribution.Old Book of Tang: 师至河东，弘基以兵千人先济河，进下冯翊，为渭北道大使，得便宜从事，以殷开山为副。西略地扶风，有众六万。南渡渭水，屯于长安故城，威声大振，耀军金光门。卫文升遣兵来战，弘基逆击走之，擒甲士千余人、马数百匹。 Li Yuan's rebellion.

Two hymns that he translated from German to Lithuanian were published by Martynas Mažvydas. One of them was published in Simple Words of Catechism, the first printed book in the Lithuanian language. He earned a living tutoring sons of the nobility and frequently accompanied them to Protestant universities in Germany. He was a tutor to Martynas Mažvydas and Bishop Merkelis Giedraitis. Biography Very little is known about Zablockis. His last name was derived from his birthplace. It literally means \\"from beyond a bog/swamp/marsh\\" and is likely a Polonized version of a Lithuanian toponym such as Užbalis, Užpelkis, or similar. There are many similar localities in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Vaclovas Biržiška guessed that Zablockis could have been a neighbor of Abraomas Kulvietis and thus could be from the area of Kulva. Other works provide in present-day Belarus near the Belarus–Lithuania border. The first recorded information about Zablockis comes from 3 August 1528 when he enrolled into the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. Based on this, his birth year is estimated to be around 1510. Abraomas Kulvietis enrolled about a month prior. Zablockis enrolled with a group of students from Lithuania which also included Stanislovas Rapalionis. He then disappeared from written records until 23 November 1540 when he enrolled into the Protestant University of Wittenberg. A day later, two Lithuanian students also enrolled into the university. Therefore, it is likely that Zablockis was their mentor and tutor. In 1541 or 1542, Zablockis returned to Lithuania and briefly taught at a school established by Kulvietis in Vilnius. When Queen Bona Sforza who supported and protected the Protestants left for Poland, Kulvietis and Zablockis moved to Königsberg to avoid the persecution by Bishop Paweł Holszański. In August 1542, Duke Albert of Prussia wrote two recommendation letters for Zablockis to the Elder of Samogitia and to Grand Duke Sigismund I the Old. With these letters, Zablockis returned to Kraków where he likely taught nobility's children and earned a master's degree. He went back to Königsberg at the end of 1544 and persuaded Kulvietis to return to Lithuania. After obtaining a letter of recommendation from Duke Albert to Mikołaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwiłł, they returned to Lithuania, but Kulvietis became mortally ill. Zablockis cared for him until his death on 6 June 1545 in Kulva. Zablockis then returned to Königsberg where he enrolled into the University of Königsberg together with three Lithuanian students – Martynas Mažvydas, , and . Zablockis reappears in written records in March–August 1560 when he helped eight Lithuanians, including future bishop Merkelis Giedraitis, and his brother, and relatives of Grand Chancellor , to enroll into the University of Tübingen. The group was initiated by Pier Paolo Vergerio who visited Vilnius twice and Mikołaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwiłł. Zablockis lived in Tübingen for about three years. In May 1563, Zablockis and his students attended the wedding of Duchess Hedwig of Württemberg and Louis IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Marburg. After the wedding, Zablockis traveled to Switzerland to meet other Protestant activists including John Calvin. It appears that Zablockis returned to Tübingen and died shortly after as his students were recalled by their parents in late 1563 without Zaborskis. Works Three published works of Zablockis are known – two translated Lithuanian hymns and a Latin epitaph. In 1547, Martynas Mažvydas published Simple Words of Catechism, the first printed book in the Lithuanian language, which included a hymn translated into Lithuanian by Zablockis. The book did not identify the author or the translator of the hymn, but the same hymn – this time attributed to Zablockis – was republished in a hymnal prepared by Mažvydas or and published in 1570. Titled Litanija naujai suguldyta (Litany Newly Translated), it has 21 six-line stanzas. The 1570 edition removed the last stanza as it wished health to the duchess, i.e. the deceased wife of Albert, Duke of Prussia (he was married twice and his wives died in 1547 and 1568). The hymn was translated from German; it is known from two hymnals published in Marburg in 1549 and two other hymnals published in Königsberg in 1549. The 1570 hymnal included the second hymn translated by Zablockis, Giesmė apie Kristaus iš numirusių prisikėlimą (Hymn About the Resurrection of Christ from the Dead). A six-line Latin epitaph was published by Merkelis Giedraitis in 1561 to commemorate the death of Katarzyna, mother of who was Zablockis' student in Tübingen.

Organized in December 1861, the unit first served in the Shenandoah Valley. Battery F fought at Hancock, Winchester, Sulphur Springs, Second Bull Run, Chantilly, and Antietam in 1862. The following year the unit fought at Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Bristoe Campaign, and Mine Run. In 1864–1865, Battery F fought at Morton's Ford and served in the garrisons of Washington, D.C. and Harper's Ferry, West Virginia before being mustered out in June 1865. One enlisted man from the battery won the Medal of Honor for heroic action at Gettysburg. Organizations Battery F, Pennsylvania Light Artillery formed at Williamsport, Pennsylvania on 7 December 1861. The unit marched to the upper Potomac River where it joined Nathaniel P. Banks's command on 15 December. From that date until March 1862, Battery F was attached to Banks's Division, Army of the Potomac. From March to June 1862, the unit served with the 1st Division in Banks's V Corps and the Department of the Shenandoah. From June to September 1862, the unit belonged to the artillery of the II Corps, Army of Virginia. From September 1862 to May 1863, the battery was attached to the 2nd Division, XII Corps, Army of the Potomac. From May to October 1863, Battery F served in the 4th Volunteer Brigade of the Artillery Reserve, Army of the Potomac. From October 1863 to March 1864, the unit was in the Artillery Brigade, II Corps. Between March and May 1864, the battery moved to Camp Barry, Defenses of Washington, XXII Corps. From May to July 1864, it became part of 2nd Brigade, Gustavus De Russy's Division, XXII Corps. From July 1864 to January 1865, Battery F served in the Reserve Division, Department of West Virginia. Between January and March 1865, it was part of the 1st Separate Brigade, 3rd Division, West Virginia. In March and April, the battery became part of the Artillery Reserve, Army of the Shenandoah. From April to June 1865, the unit was in the 3rd Brigade, Martin D. Hardin's Division, XXII Corps, Department of Washington. History =1861–1862= Independent Battery F, Pennsylvania Light Artillery was recruited at Pittsburgh and enlisted for a term of three years. The original officers were Captain Robert B. Hampton, First Lieutenant James P. Fleming, First Lieutenant Nathaniel Irish, Second Lieutenant Alfred N. Harbours. On 18 December 1861, the unit was engaged in a skirmish at Potomac River Dam No. 5. On 4–6 January 1862, the battery fought at the Battle of Hancock. On 26 February, Battery F crossed the Potomac with Banks's forces, heading south. The unit joined in the advance to Winchester, Virginia on 1–12 March, occupying the town on the latter date. The battery joined in the pursuit of Stonewall Jackson up the Shenandoah Valley 24 March–27 April. There was skirmishing with Jackson's forces at Edinburg from 5–18 April. After that, Banks's troops advanced to Cross Keys where there was a skirmish on 26 April. At that point Banks began withdrawing. On 23 May 1862, Jackson's reinforced Confederates wiped one of Banks's garrisons in the Battle of Front Royal and threatened to cut off Banks's division from Winchester. Banks ordered his outnumbered troops to retreat on 24 May from Strasburg and appointed John Porter Hatch to command his rearguard and burn any supplies that could not be carted off. Hatch's command included the 1st Vermont Cavalry and 5th New York Cavalry Regiments, 10 companies from two more cavalry regiments, one howitzer from 4th U.S. Artillery, Battery F, and Battery F, Pennsylvania Light. At 4:00 pm, one company of infantry, the depot guard, several cavalry companies, and Battery F found that Jackson's troops blocked the Valley Turnpike ahead of them at Middletown. After Captain Hampton and the other officers conferred, the small Union force retreated south to Strasburg, covered by Battery F's four Parrott rifles. One shell wounded eight soldiers from the 7th Louisiana Infantry Regiment while another exploded under Richard Taylor's horse without inflicting any injury. The Federal infantry, cavalry, and 35 wagons eventually escaped to Hancock, Maryland. Battery F found its way back to Banks's main force where it fought in the First Battle of Winchester on 25 May. One two-gun section deployed on the Valley Turnpike with Winchester at its back. The other two-gun section took post on the Federal right flank. For almost two hours, 16 Union guns dueled with 26 Confederate guns. In the rout that followed, some Federal infantrymen complained that the fleeing cavalry and artillery threatened to trample those on foot. The Union reported losses of 71 killed, 243 wounded, and 1,714 missing, though many sick soldiers were left behind in the hospitals. Confederate losses were 68 killed, 329 wounded, and three missing. On 29–30 June 1862, Battery F participated in a reconnaissance to Front Royal and Luray. The unit remained at Front Royal until August. Next, it served in John Pope's Northern Virginia campaign from 16 August to 2 September. At the start of the campaign, Battery F was assigned to Henry Bohlen's brigade which was part of Carl Schurz's 3rd Division in Franz Sigel's corps. In August, Lieutenant Joseph L. Miller joined Battery F with 50 men and two guns, raising the total number of guns from four to six. The battery fought at the Battle of Sulphur Springs on 24 August. At Freeman's Ford, Schurz sent Bohlen's three regiments across the Rappahannock River, hoping to catch Stonewall Jackson's wagon train. The Federals were suddenly attacked by Isaac R. Trimble's Confederate brigade which was soon joined by John Bell Hood's two brigades. Bohlen was killed; his troops were routed and chased across the river. Battery F under Captain Hampton served with Alexander Schimmelfennig's brigade at the Second Battle of Bull Run on 28–30 August 1862. At about 4:00 pm on 29 August, Robert H. Milroy noticed two Confederate brigades launching a flank attack. Spotting Battery F moving from the right flank toward the left, Milroy ordered the first two-gun section to take position south of Groveton Woods. A second section took position at the western edge of the woods. The battery opened fire with canister shot and \\"we slaughtered them\\" reported one lieutenant. When the Confederates closed to within , Milroy ordered Hampton to withdraw. In one section, the attackers captured one cannon when too many horses were shot and could not haul it away. In the other section, another gun was lost when its final discharge jammed the handspike into a tree stump. The Confederates used captured Unions soldiers to haul away the two captured guns because no horses were available. The battery fought at the Battle of Chantilly on 1 September. During the Maryland Campaign, Battery F under Captain Hampton was part of the artillery belonging to Joseph K. Mansfield's XII Corps. At the Battle of Antietam on 17 September, only four of seven of the XII Corps batteries went into action, including Hampton's. The XII Corps batteries reinforced the I Corps batteries north of the Miller cornfield and faced toward the West Woods. These batteries remained in action until the late afternoon. Battery F was armed with four 10-pounder Parrott rifles and its casualties at Antietam were three men wounded. On 22 September, the unit reported a strength of three officers and 76 enlisted men. On 19 September the battery marched to Harper's Ferry and remained there until December. The exceptions were a reconnaissance near Snickersville and Rippon on 8–9 November and another one to Winchester on 2–6 December. The battery moved to Fredericksburg on 12–16 December. =1863–1865= Thompson's battery can be seen north of the Peach Orchard in this 2 July map of the Battle of Gettysburg. Battery F endured Burnside's Mud March on 20–24 January 1863. Then it remained at Stafford Courthouse until 27 April 27. At the Battle of Chancellorsville on 1–4 May 1863, Battery F was assigned to John W. Geary's 2nd Division in the XII Corps under Henry Warner Slocum. When the XI Corps was routed on 2 May, Army of the Potomac commander Joseph Hooker ordered XII Corps artillery chief Clermont L. Best to form a battery facing west at the Fairview clearing. At twilight, Best had massed 37 artillery pieces from seven different batteries at Fairview. On the morning of 3 May, Battery F with its six Parrott rifles formed part of the gun line at Fairview. Some of the Fairview batteries were protected by earthen revetments, but those at the southern end of the line were not. The southernmost batteries, including Battery F, were only from a powerful Confederate battery at Hazel Grove. During the day's fighting, an enemy shell detonated one of Battery F's caissons and Captain Hampton was mortally wounded in the explosion. Battery F lost two killed and seven wounded at Chancellorsville. Nathaniel Irish was promoted to captain in May. Battery F participated in the Gettysburg campaign from 11 June to 24 July 1863. At the Battle of Gettysburg on 1–3 July, the unit was converged with Independent Battery C, Pennsylvania Light Artillery under Captain James Thompson. Batteries C and F fought as part of Freeman McGilvery's 1st Volunteer Artillery Brigade in the Army of the Potomac's Artillery Reserve commanded by Robert O. Tyler. On 2 July, Daniel Sickles disobeyed orders by moving his III Corps forward. When the Army of the Potomac's commander George Meade discovered Sickles's mistake, it was too late to do anything but reinforce the thinly-spread III Corps. The Army of the Potomac's artillery chief Henry Jackson Hunt ordered some batteries from his Artillery Reserve to move to the support of Sickles. When Sickles's line finally collapsed from the Confederate attack, the artillery batteries hastily withdrew. Private Casper R. Carlisle of Battery F earned the Medal of Honor for saving one of the battery's guns while under heavy fire. On 3 July, during the Confederate artillery bombardment that preceded George Pickett's charge, Hunt wanted the Reserve Artillery to save their ammunition until the enemy infantry appeared. On the other hand, II Corps commander Winfield Scott Hancock wanted the guns firing to encourage his infantrymen. McGilvery refused Hancock's command to order his brigade to fire, so Hancock tried to persuade the individual battery commanders to do so. Hancock browbeat Thompson into opening fire, which drew Confederate counterbattery fire that caused casualties among McGilvery's heretofore hidden guns. Out of 105 men present in Batteries C and F, the combined unit suffered 28 casualties at Gettysburg. Lieutenant Miller was fatally wounded at Gettysburg, dying five weeks later. Battery F joined in the Army of the Potomac's advance from the Rappahannock to the Rapidan River on 13–17 September 1863. The unit served in the Bristoe campaign. It was present during the battles of Second Auburn and Bristoe Station on 14 October. The battery moved to the Rappahannock on 7–8 November. Battery F was present during the Battle of Mine Run on 26 November–2 December. The battery crossed the Rapidan at Germanna Ford and was engaged at Mine Run on 27–28 November and at White Hall Church on 29–30 November. It re-crossed the Rapidan at Gold Mine Ford and went into winter quarters at Brandy Station. The unit fought at the Battle of Morton's Ford on the Rapidan on 6 February 1864. More recruits joined Battery F at this time. The battery marched to Camp Barry where it was re-fitted. It replaced some heavy artillery units in the defenses of Washington, D.C. on 14 May. From May until July, it manned Washington D.C. defenses south of the Potomac. From July 1864 until April 1865, the battery garrisoned Harper's Ferry. Battery F was reassigned to the defenses of Washington until it was mustered out on 26 June 1865. Losses Battery F sustained losses of two officers and eight enlisted men killed and mortally wounded in action, while 14 enlisted men died of disease; there were 24 fatalities.

The effects on humans usually include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea; multiple deaths have been associated with its use. Kambo, which originated as a folk medicine practice among indigenous peoples of the Amazon, is also administered as an alternative medicine treatment in the West, often as a pseudoscientific cleanse or detox. The ceremony involves burning an arm or leg and applying the kambo secretion directly to the burn. Proponents claim that kambo helps with a number of illnesses or injuries, but there is no scientific evidence that it is an effective treatment of any kind. History Kambo is traditionally practiced by Panoan-speaking indigenous groups in the southeast Amazon rainforest, such as the Mayoruna, Matses, Amahuaca, Kashinawa, Katukina, Yawanawá and the Kaxinawá. Traditional practitioners claim that it aids fertility, cleanses the body and soul, increases strength and brings good luck on hunts. They use it for expelling \\"panema\\" (bad spirit), and to induce abortions. (please note that this is not a very reliable medical source; see talk tab) Since the mid-20th-century, kambo has also been practiced in urban regions of Brazil. In 2004, Brazil banned the sale and marketing of kambo. Import is illegal in Chile. Outside of South America, it first became popular as an alternative therapy in the late 2010s. In non-indigenous use, the frog secretion is described and marketed as a \\"detox\\" treatment, cleanse, purge, and as a \\"vaccine\\" which is \\"good for everything\\". Kambo has been marketed both as a \\"scientific\\" remedy, with emphasis on the biochemistry, and as a \\"spiritual\\" remedy, with emphasis on its indigenous origins. Purging (deliberate vomiting) has been a popular treatment since the 1800s. \\"Detox\\" has been described by Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine, as a term for conventional medical treatments for addiction which has been \\"hijacked by entrepreneurs, quacks and charlatans to sell a bogus treatment\\". The ceremony The kambo ritual. A) Phyllomedusa bicolor. B) Collecting the frog's secretions. C) Applying kambo to burns on the skin. D) Closeup of skin marks. Phyllomedusa bicolor \\"Kambô\\" is a common name of Phyllomedusa bicolor, an Amazonian tree frog also known as the blue-and-yellow frog, bicolored tree-frog, giant monkey frog, giant leaf frog or waxy-monkey tree frog (\\"sapo\\" means \\"frog\\" in Portuguese and \\"toad\\" in Spanish). To collect the secretions for the ceremony, a frog is caught, then tied tightly to four sticks placed in the ground, and its limbs stretched between the sticks. This causes the frog to become stressed enough to activate its defence mechanism, and secrete a substance containing peptides from its skin. Once the secretions has been scraped off the frog it is usually released back into the wild. The secretions are then left to dry. In native use, small dots are deliberately burned on the skin, and a small dose of the frog secretions is applied to the open wounds. Outside South America, a kambo ceremony can involve just two people, the practitioner and participant, or a number of participants at once, which is known as a kambo circle. Participants are encouraged to bring plenty of water, a towel and a bucket. There are usually yoga mats on the floor and the ceremony room, which is often the practitioner's living room, is heavily incensed. During the ceremony the skin of the participant is deliberately burnt multiple times, usually on the upper arm or leg, by the practitioner using a smouldering stick or vine. The frog secretions, which have been reconstituted with saliva or water, are then pasted on to the burnt skin. Outside South America, the ceremony is performed in a group or circle, where the participants are encouraged to shout \\"Viva\\" when one of them vomits into their bucket. Short-term effects include violent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, edema (swelling) of the face, headaches, and tachycardia. The secretions seem to be vasoactive (affecting the circulation), which may explain why they are absorbed so rapidly. In native practice, the secretions are removed from the wounds after 10 to 15 minutes, ending the acute symptoms. Joaquim Luz, a Yamanawa leader, criticized commercial sales and the use of kambo without the preparation or permission of indigenous peoples, saying that users were put at risk, including the risk of death. Other native groups have also expressed concerns. =Claims= Users and practitioners of kambo claim that the alternative medicine helps with a wide variety of issues and conditions. These claims include treating addiction, depression, and chronic pain, reducing fevers, increasing fertility, boosting energy and physical strength, and improving mental clarity. It is also claimed that kambo removes negative energy and cleanses the soul and body. There is currently no scientific basis to these claims. There is no solid medical evidence on how the frog toxins work, whether they are useful for treating anything, and whether they can be used safely: no clinical trials have tested them on humans, . Reports of adverse events are numerous, including for use with experienced guidance. Kym Jenkins of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, in a Sydney Morning Herald article, said \\"people with mental illness are a more vulnerable group anyway for a variety of reasons. If you're feeling very anxious or very depressed ... you're automatically more vulnerable and you could be more susceptible to people advertising or marketing a quick fix. I do have concerns that people can be preyed upon when they are more vulnerable.\\" Kambo has been described by a toxicologist as a risky, potentially life-threatening procedure. =Pharmacology= The frog secretes a range of small chemical compounds of a type called peptides, which have a number of different effects. Peptides found in the frog secretions include dermorphins and deltorphins, which bind to opioid receptors, sauvagine, a vasodilator, and dermaseptin, which exhibits antimicrobial properties in vitro. Various other substances such as phyllomedusin, phyllokinin, caerulein, and adrenoregulin are also present. There is active medical research into the peptides found in the skin secretions of Phyllomedusa bicolor, focusing on discovering their biological effects. There have been some preclinical trials in mice and rats, but no phase-1 tests or clinical trials of safety in humans, . =Notable deaths= In Brazil in 2008, a person was charged with illegal exercise of medicine and felony murder after administering kambo toxins to a business colleague, who died; the deceased's son, who said his father had pressured him into participating, suffered more minor effects. In Chile in 2009, Daniel Lara Aguilar, who suffered from chronic discopathy, died immediately after taking kambo administered by a local shaman in a mass healing ceremony; the autopsy was inconclusive due to pre-existing conditions. The medical literature reported the 2018 case in Italy of a person with no known preexisting conditions besides obesity, who seems, according to autopsy reports, to have died of cardiac arrhythmia while under the effects of kambo use. In March 2019, kambo practitioner Natasha Lechner suffered a cardiac arrest and died while receiving kambo. In April 2019, a homicide investigation was opened into the death by \\"severe cerebral edema\\" of a young person who had taken kambo toxins in Chile; the import of the frog and its secretions is illegal in Chile.

Life  John Chervinsky was an American engineer and self taught photographer. He was born in 1961 in Niagara Falls, New York and died in 2015 at the age of 54 due to pancreatic cancer. After his death, the John Chervinsky Emerging Photography Scholarship at the Griffin Museum of Photography was established with the intent to provide support and encouragement in the professional lives of emerging photographers; enhancing their ability to develop their personal vision for photography. His photographs have been widely published in The Los Angeles Times, LeMond, South Korea’s Photo+, among others. Chervinsky’s main occupation was an engineer in applied physics. For 18 years Chervinsky ran a particle accelerator at Harvard University and went on to work at the Harvard’s Rowland Institute for Science, where he collaborated with various museums to analyze works of art using the elementary particle accelerator. Until 2001, Chervinsky focused on street photography but changed the focus of his subject matter when three major tragedies occurred. In the span of a year his wife, Kirsten Chervinsky, became ill, the 911 attacks on the World Trade Center occurred, and his friend Guy Pollard, a fellow photographer, died unexpectedly. With the combinations of these three events, Chervinsky focused on studio photography that combined his love for the arts and physics.  Exhibitions  In 2005, Chervinsky would have his first exhibit at the Griffin Museum. He then exhibited in a traveling exhibition organized by the George Eastman House. He has also shown his work at the Spencer Museum of Art, the Georgia Museum of Art at the University of Georgia, the Fitchburg Art Museum, and the John Michael Kohler Arts Center. He has had solo exhibitions at the Michael Mazzeo Gallery in New York City, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory Art Gallery, Richard Levy Gallery, and the Blue Sky Gallery, also known as the Oregon Center for the Photographic Arts.  Photography  Chervinsky's engineering background significantly influenced his photographic work. His work uses visual metaphors about the laws of nature and how they relate to everyday life. The concepts in his work address the correlation between rational, scientific explanations regarding existence and humankind's attempts to explain the world through belief systems. His work has been described as \\"energetic, mixed-media still lifes\\" that \\"involve creative assemblages of both found and constructed objects, often with drawn elements.\\" A formative moment in his studio practice occurred when he contemplated drawing a circle in a square corner of a room; from a specific point of view, the chalk line looked round in a photograph. The concept evolved to combine physics formulas, chalk, forced perspective with physical objects to create still life images that convey the laws of nature. Cherivinsky would sometimes include actual scientific concepts into his works, for example, an image that referred to the presence of water on Mars. All of these photos were in black and white, and were printed on matte paper giving them the look of a chalkboard. Chervinsky's ouvre is considered part of the post-photography, staged-photography and constructed-image movements. He also experimented with Polaroid photography, and was included in the exhibition organized by the MIT Museum, The Polaroid Project: At the Intersection of Art and Technology. The show traveled to the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, The Museum for Photography Vienna, the McCord Museum in Montreal, the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg, the C/O Berlin Foundation, and the National Museum of Singapore. Cherivinsky’s color photography predominantly focused on the passage of time or of motion. Cherivisnky would take a picture of a still life and would then send it to China for it to be painted. Once the painting was received, Cherivisnky would position the painted proxy close to the original still life and rephotograph the tableau. A hand-made edition of a monograph of his work, An Experiment in Perspective, was produced as part of a residency at Light Work in Syracuse, New York, and was produced by Digital Silver Imaging (Belmont, MA).  Collections  Chervinsky's photographic works are in the collections of the Portland Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Wright State University Gallery Collection, the Steen Art Collection of the Harvard Business School, List Visual Art Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, among others.

He was President of the Conservative movement's international Rabbinical Assembly from 2004 until 2006.  Biography  Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on December 16, 1954, Rank attended the University of Minnesota for his undergraduate degree and earned his MA and rabbinic ordination at the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1981. Rank served, from his ordination until 1987, as the spiritual leader at Congregation Shomrei Emunah in Montclair, New Jersey, followed by twelve years as the Rabbi of Temple Beth Ahm (now merged and renamed as Temple Beth Ahm Yisrael) in Springfield, New Jersey. In 1998, the Rabbinical Assembly published Rank's edited volume, Moreh Derekh, a guide to rabbinic officiation at life cycle events in accordance with contemporary Conservative Jewish practice and thought, replacing Conservative clergy's theretofore most recent life cycle manual (which was, at the time, 33 years old). Moreh Derekh remains in use today, even among rabbis of multiple denominations outside Conservative Judaism itself. Rank began to serve Midway Jewish Center in 1999 and continues to serve there at this time. Rank served as President of the international Rabbinical Assembly from 2004 until 2006. During this time, he assisted in the RA's work in creating a centralized framework for conversion within Conservative Judaism, an effort not dissimilar from his prior work in New Jersey in working with other regional Conservative rabbis in education towards conversion. As President of the RA, Rank sat as an ex-officio member of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS), during a time when halakhic questions surrounding homosexuality were contentiously debated and the CJLS adopted the practice of requiring 20 of its 25 members to vote in favor of a teshuvah deemed a takkanah, a procedure that Rank was assigned to explain to the membership of the RA. In his position as a defender of Jewish law as understood within Conservative Jewish framework, Rank spoke at the 2004 March for Women's Lives about the halakhic understanding of when abortion becomes necessary. A letter penned by Rank early in his tenure as President of the RA addressed the fashion in which halakhah demands ethical treatment of animals in slaughterhousesa letter cited both among bloggers and in such widely accessed venues as Jonathan Safran Foer's book Eating Animals. Rank is married to Ellen Rank, a Jewish educator, and is a father of three, including Rabbi Jonah Rank.  A Full-Figured Faith  In 2019, Rank completed and saw the release in paperback and electronic editions of his first book in his role as sole author, A Full-Figured Faith: The Expanding Effects of Doubt and Skepticism on an Evolving Jewish Faith.

Early life He was born on 16 January 1868 in Woodend, just north of Christchurch. He was educated at Cook's private school and was first employed with the Railways Department as a cadet. Hinge then spent time travelling and working abroad, including ten years in the large farming territories of the Australian Outback. When he arrived back in Christchurch in 1900 he began his career as a newspaper photographer for the Lyttelton Times. In 1902 he married Blanche Ethel Mohr. Career 1st aerial photograph of Christchurch (1918) Leslie Hinge's studio in Christchurch Hinge was an adventurous photographer. He trekked on foot through the King Country in 1900, covered the Cheviot earthquake in 1901, and was part of two rescue missions to find wrecked ships on remote islands. He travelled on horseback with surveyors mapping the proposed road between the East and West Coast of the South Island, and accompanied naturalists checking the growth of the Wapiti deer population in Fiordland. Hinge climbed Mount Ruapehu to photograph the crater, and his photographs of Mount Cook are credited with helping open up the district to tourism. Along with landscape images Hinge became known for his photographs of New Zealand’s pastoral industries and some lesser-known occupations – gum digging, oyster culture, possum trapping, fishing, deer stalking, and the timber industry were all popular subjects. From November 1914 to December 1915 Hinge attended the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. During this exhibition, Hinge won the World Gold Medal for photographic animal studies. In 1918 Hinge became the first person to take aerial photographs of Christchurch from an aeroplane. In 1919 he became the staff photographer at the Auckland Weekly News, and in 1920/1921 became the first to photograph Wellington from the air. He covered all the Royal visits to New Zealand between the two world wars, and was in the first motor car to reach Murchison after the 1929 earthquake. By 1931 Hinge was a photographer with the New Zealand Railway Publicity department, retiring in 1940. Death Leslie Hinge died on 21 June 1942. In his obituary in Wellington's Evening Post, he was described as \\"one of the first to realise that the Press photographer must also be a journalist in the news sense\\", and was credited with being a pioneer in adventure tourism photography.

It \\"stands out\\" from the mass of medieval guide books \\"for its literary and informative qualities\\". Author About the author of the Libellus nothing is known for certain besides what he says about himself. He was a German monk named Theoderich (or Dietrich) who visited Palestine himself around 1172. He was probably a Rhinelander, since he travelled with a certain Adolf from Cologne and he was familiar with the Palatine Chapel at Aachen.Stewart, \\"Preface\\" to Theoderich 1891, pp. iii–ix. He may have been from Hirsau Abbey. He is often identified with the Dietrich to whom John of Würzburg dedicated his Descriptio terrae sanctae, another guide to Palestine. John travelled to the Holy Land shortly before Dietrich in the 1160s. He is also sometimes identified with Dietrich of Hohenburg, who became the bishop of Würzburg in 1223. There is nothing to connect him to the two known Dietrichs of late 12th-century Würzburg, the provosts of Werdea and Onolsbach. Itinerary and description Although Dietrich is an eyewitness for much of what he describes in the Libellus, he also makes use of other eyewitness reports and of written sources to round out his account. He used as a source the same compendium as used by John of Würzburg. In his introduction, he gives his work a spiritual purpose: to help bring Christ to mind for those who cannot see the Holy Places themselves and thereby to love and pity him, bringing themselves closer to heaven. Dietrich's pilgrimage can be dated to between 1171 and 1173, during the reign of King Amalric of Jerusalem, when the Holy Places were under Christian control. It began in Acre during March or April. From there he took the road to Jerusalem, Jericho and the river Jordan. He went back by the same route and was in Acre preparing to embark on the Wednesday of Easter Week. He may have made a detour to visit Nazareth, Tiberias and Mount Tabor, but his description of the Sea of Galilee is very confused. His description of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre indicates that he was there during the renovations financed by the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. He is also the earliest source to mention the Sultan's Pool, then a newly constructed cistern. The skill and detail of Dietrich's architectural descriptions has led to the suggestion that he was an ecclesiastical architect. He clearly had knowledge of construction techniques and building materials, and his descriptions are clear. The Libellus is an important source for the art, architecture and agriculture of the Kingdom of Jerusalem on the eve of its fall. Dietrich shows less interest in miracles and wonders, but does provide a first-hand account of the coming of the Holy Fire. Although \\"he directs no sarcasm against men of other faiths\\", he does show anti-Jewish prejudice and records being frightened by some local \\"Saracens\\" shouting in Arabic as they worked in a field. Manuscripts For the longest time the Libellus was known only from one manuscript of the 15th century. In 1985, a second copy was discovered, also of the 15th century. R. B. C. Huygens produced the first critical edition based on both manuscripts. Both manuscripts include several other texts on the Holy Land besides the Libellus.

It was the press organ for the ideological and political program of the Lliga Regionalista, and the conservative editorial line promoted the so-called Autonomia, the normality of the public use of the catalan language, and the Catalan school. From a journalistic point of view, it was a modern newspaper, organized by sections, with correspondents and collaborators in the territory, and a team that combined young people and the best journalists of the time. It was the longest running newspaper in Catalan of the 20th century, with 38 years of daily publication. The header, designed by Domènec i Montaner, showed a quadribarred eagle. Josep Pla and Eugeni Xammar, in their day, and journalism historian Josep Maria Figueres, nowadays, have considered La Veu the best Catalan newspaper ever. Also under that name, Valentí Almirall's Diari Català had previously been published, during one of the periods in which it was suspended, between 30 July and 28 August 1880.Torrent, Joan; Tasis, Rafael (1966).

Institut d'Estudis Catalans, Barcelona, 1999. . Part available at Google Llibres History The newspaper \\"La Veu\\", as it is popularly known, was a continuation of the literary and political weekly of the same name, founded in 1891 by Narcís Verdaguer, Joaquim Cabot and Jaume Collell and published in December 1898, when it became a daily newspaper. The main political and journalistic figures of the future Veu de Catalunya newspaper, such as Francesc Cambó, Lluís Duran i Ventosa, Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Joaquim Rubió i Ors, Joan Sardà i Lloret, were among the writers and contributors. The daily edition was started by Enric Prat de la Riba with a political orientation and in defense of the program of the Regionalist League. It was suspended in different periods, for articles published in 1900, 1901, 1902 and 1905; in 1902 its director was arrested during the day for reproducing an article in \\"L' independent de Perpinyà\\" on Rossellonese wine makers. The newspaper was also suspended in 1917, when the \\"Assemblea de Parlamentaris\\" (Parliamentary Assembly) was convened, to prevent it from having a written public forum. In all cases, it ended up appearing with other names (La Creu de Catalunya, Diari de Catalunya, La Veu de Barcelona, El Poble Català, Baluard de Sitges, Costa de Ponent) to avoid the ban. The editorial staff was attacked by a group of soldiers on 25 November 1905, who were upset by a caricature of Junceda, in which he is known as the \\"Fets del Cu-Cut!\\" and that this was the beginning of a process of repression of Catalan society through the \\"Llei de Jurisdiccions\\" (Law of Jurisdictions). That event stimulate the creation of Catalan Solidarity, an alliance of Catalan parties that would triumph in the elections to the Parliament in 1907. In July 1936, the newspaper installations were intervened, although they continued to be published, but with subtitles that defined the changes in political orientation: \\"Diari de l'autonomia i de la República\\" (Republic and Autonomous Newspaper), \\"Diari antifeixista controlat pel Comitè Obrer\\" (Anti-fascist newspaper controlled by workers committee) and \\"CNT-Diari antifeixista-AIT\\" (CNT Anti-fascist newspaper AIT). Influence It is remarkable the great social and political influence that \\"La Veu\\" will have in the journalism of the first third of the 20th century. It was a modern newspaper, divided into sections, which promoted the professionalization of journalism. It has a wide network of collaborators and correspondents around the world. Its journalists will create the first ethical manuals and will establish precise internal instructions for the writing of articles, the contrast of sources and the design of the pages. In its pages wrote politicians, writers and journalists such as Enric Prat de la Riba, Francesc Cambó, Raimon Casellas, Josep Maria de Sagarra, Joan Maragall, Joaquim Folch i Torres, Ildefons Sunyol i Casanovas, Prudenci Bertrana, Josep Maria Junoy, Eugeni d'Ors (with the pseudonym Xènius), Josep Pla, Josep Lleonart i Maragall, Jaume Bofill i Mates (Puck, Guerau de Liost, One), Josep Carner (Bellafila, Caliban, Two), Manuel Brunet, Carles Sentís, Irene Polo, Ignasi Agustí, Ferran Agulló (Pol), Manuel de Montoliu. It is worth highlighting the importance of its literary and thought pages, such as the daily collaboration of Xènius with his \\"Glosari\\", between 1906 and 1921, the verses of Josep Carner \\"Rimes de l'hora\\", the narrative of Narcís Oller, the translations of Sagarra, the articles of Josep Pla, Gaziel, Maragall, etc. In 1909, Raimon Casellas and Joaquim Folch i Torres created the \\"Pàgina Artística\\" (Artistic Page), from where they would express their art reviews. When Casellas committed suicide in 1910, Folch moved to the head of the art section of \\"La Veu\\", and used to sign with the pseudonym Flama. From this platform he was one of the first to use the term \\"Noucentisme\\", coined by Eugeni d'Ors, a participant in the very definition of the cultural movement of renewal that still did not respond to a specific definition. Between 1929 and 1930, Llucieta Canyà was the head of the daily section \\"Món feminí\\" (Feminine World), essential to know the Spanish conservative feminist movement before the civil war. Manuel Brunet was in charge of the cultural section. In this section appeared the first twenty-eight chants of Dante's Divine Comedy, translated by Josep Maria de Sagarra, with twenty-seven corresponding comments, but the Civil War truncated this enterprise. In addition to Prat de la Riba, Josep Morató i Grau, Joaquim Pellicena i Camacho and Ramon d'Abadal i de Vinyals also were directors of the newspaper.

A second branch and campus opened in Los Angeles, California in 2018. Identity School of Acting began in 2003 with 10 students at the Arcola Theatre in Hackney. Although open to prospective students of all ethnicities, Oguns founded the institution with the intent of reaching out to black and minority actors and promoting the diversity of the real world on stage and onscreen, as well as holding casting directors account due to the lack of opportunity he'd found in his own early acting experiences. The school later moved to Holborn. The school offers part-time acting training starting at age 16. The school is affiliated with Identity Agency Group, which was established in 2006. However, the agency is a separate entity; not all students and alumni are necessarily represented by the agency, and not every actor represented by IAG is necessarily a student or alumnus of IDSA. The Los Angeles branch of Identity School was launched in 2018 with alumni John Boyega, Letitia Wright, Malachi Kirby, Damson Idris, and Melanie Liburd as patrons of the new faculty.

With 300 million cars in China, Chinese vehicles are now entering the used vehicle market overseas to boost demand for the domestic market. According to the African Courier, it's suggested that the export of used cars is a way to deepen implementations to the Belt and Road Initiative. History A Soueast Chrysler-made Chrysler Grand Voyager RS van in a used car market in Beijing in 2014. The Automotive industry in China had contracted when vehicle sales declined with 28 million vehicles in 2018, which represented an annual drop of 2.76%. This was the first decline in the industry seen since 1990 due to falling sales and the effects of the China–United States trade war with US$200 billion raised on Chinese-made products. The concept of exporting used Chinese-made vehicles were made public in April 2019 when the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Public Security, and the General Administration of Customs jointly issued a public notice on Supporting the Export of Used Cars in Conditionally Mature Areas. These are responsible for certifying the export of used cars from China. On May 6, 2019, it was reported that the Chinese Ministry of Commerce officially announced the approval of legally exporting used Chinese vehicles in an effort to increase domestic sales and promote trade in the automotive market. MOFCOM has mentioned that they'll work in identifying companies that can handles vehicle exports and for testing standards to ensure that the used cars are sold safely. In a MOFCOM press conference on May 9, 2019, it was mentioned that it is working with officials from the General Administration of Customs and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to administer export licensing for vehicles shipped out of China. In July 2019, it was announced that the first exports consisted of 300 used cars for Cambodia, Myanmar, Nigeria and Russia from Guangdong. The first exports were made through the Nansha Port while others were done via the China-Europe Railway Express. On September 3, 2019, Tianjin had exported 60 used vehicles with a value of US$700,000 from the Dongjiang Free Trade Port Zone to the Port of Apapa in Nigeria. In November 2019, an export of 500 used cars were reported to be sold to Benin for US$3 million from Guangdong. A statement released by Guangdong Good Car Holdings Co. Ltd. on November 21, 2019 says that it was the most valuable order received for the export of used cars. On November 11, 2019, it was reported that some used vehicles were sold to Kyrgyzstan. Designated Locations Ten cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, were announced to be designated areas where used vehicles can be legally exported from. Xi'an and Tianjin were also designated as export cities. Effects According to Alan Kang, an analyst at LMC Automotive, he said that exports of Chinese vehicles overseas will have a medium to long term effect in helping Chinese automobile manufacturers \\"smoothen sales of new cars\\". Sales of used Chinese vehicles to emerging markets would drive down prices, it would make an impact on new cars being sold and manufactured. They would be preferable to persons who want to buy cheaper vehicles. This gives Chinese vehicle manufacturers a chance to sell any vehicles that may run into trouble with the State VI vehicle emission standards that were implemented on July 1, 2019. The market allows the vehicles to be exported to countries that do not have strict standards for vehicles used in their own markets. Restrictions =Myanmar= The Myanma Ministry of Commerce announced strict guidelines on used car exports from China in order to crack down on vehicles that are being sold from China, but are not made in China. Proof that Chinese vehicles sold through imports, new or used, are required to have certified papers that shows that they were manufactured in China. =United States= The United States does not allow the import of a vehicle unless it's 25 years old and most newer Chinese vehicles made domestically were only made from 1994.

The first of these emanations is the hero-god Vāsudeva, with the other emanations being his kinsmen presented as extensions of Vāsudeva himself. From around the 1st century CE, this \\"Vyuha doctrine\\" (Vyūhavāda) developed out of the earlier Vīravāda cult of the Vrishni heroes, in which the five heroes Saṃkarṣaṇa, Vāsudeva, Pradyumna, Samba and Aniruddha had remained mostly human in character. Still later, around the 4th century CE, it evolved into the Avatāravāda system of incarnations of Vishnu, in which Vishnu was the primordial being and the Vrishni heroes had become his avatars. Concept and evolution The four earthly emanations, or \\"Vyuhas\\", are identified as Samkarshana (Balarama- Samkarshana, son of Vasudeva by Rohini), Vāsudeva (son of Vasudeva by Devaki), Pradyumna (son of Vasudeva by Rukmini), and Aniruddha (son of Pradyumna). They are probably similar the legendary Vrishni heroes of the Mathura region, minus Samba (son of Vasudeva by Jambavati). Originally, several of these earthly deities, particularly Vāsudeva, seem to have formed one of several major independent cults, together with the cults of Narayana, Shri and Lakshmi, before they later coalesced to form Vishnuism. The actual cult of Vishnu only developed after these initial cults were established. The heroes would then have evolved into Vaishnavite deities through a step-by-step process: 1) deification of the Vrishni heroes 2) association with the God Narayana-Vishnu 3) incorporation into the Vyuha concept of successive emanations of the God. Epigraphically, the deified status of Vāsudeva in particular is confirmed by his appearance on the coinage of Agathocles of Bactria (190-180 BCE) and by the devotional character of the Heliodorus pillar inscription (circa 110 BCE). Later, the association with Narayana (Vishnu) is suggested by the Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions of the 1st century BCE. Kushan Caturvyuha (2nd century BCE) By the 2nd century CE, the \\"avatara concept was in its infancy\\", and the depiction of Vishnu with his four emanations (the Chatur-vyūha), consisting in the Vrishni heroes minus Samba, starts to become visible in art at the end of the Kushan period. Starting with the art of Mathura, Vāsudeva (avatar of Vishnu) fittingly appears in the center of the sculptural compositions, with his decorated heavy mace on the side and a conch shell in the hand, his elder brother Balarama to his right under a serpent hood and holding a drinking cup, his son Pradyumna to his left, and his grandson Aniruddha on top. File:Caturvyuha, Vasudeva with ornate crown and flower necklace, making the Abhaya Mudra.jpgVasudeva with ornate crown and flower necklace, making the Abhaya Mudra File:Caturvyuha, Balarama under his snake hood holding a cup.jpgSamkarsana-Balarama under his snake hood holding a cup File:Caturvyuha, vasudeva's mace held by one of his supplementary hands.jpgVasudeva's mace held by one of his supplementary hands Possible Bhita Caturvyuha (2nd century BCE) The Bhita statue in the Lucknow Museum, with four characters standing around a central axis, has also been proposed as a Caturvyuha,. Vasudeva is standing at the front, and the seated lion, symbol of Samkarsana, is visible on the left. An ancient statue from Bhita near Allahabad (), with four figures facing in four directions, now in the Lucknow Museum, has been proposed to represent the Caturvyuha concept, although interpretations vary. It is dated to the 2nd century BCE on stylistic grounds, being quite similar in style to the monumental Yaksha statues. The main figure is bigger than the others, wears a crown and earrings, as well as an ornate necklace and bracelets, and raises his hand in \\"abahaya mudra\\", a symbol of deification, and holds jar in the left hand. The figure would be Vāsudeva. To the proper right side of the crowned figure appears an unidentifiable face, and below it a seated lion. This part could identified with Samkarsana, combining anthropomorphic and theriomorphic characteristics, and later associated with Narasimha. On the proper left side of the crowned figure also appears an unidentifiable face, and below it a boar on a pedestal, standing on its hind legs, with the front legs joint in the namaskāra gesture of prayer and devotion. This could be Aniruddha, later identified with Varaha. The figure on the reverse is devoid of ornamentation, the hair is parted in the middle and falls loosely, but both arms are broken, making it impossible to identify their attributes. This could be Pradyumna, later associated with Rudra and the fierce-looking Kāpila. This sculpture of the Caturvyuha shows the Vrishni heroes, but already associates them with their animal form. This seems to prefigure the Vishnu Chaturmurti, in which Vishnu, crowned with a halo, is also flanked by the images of Narasimha and Varaha, with Kāpila in back as seens in the examples from Kashmir. The general style of the figures is quite similar to that of the early Yakshas, and it has been suggested that their role might have been understood as parallel: just as the Yakshas are considered as emanations of the Supreme deity Brahman, the four Vyuhas are similarly emanations of Narayana.

David Wynn was shot and killed by Shawn Rehn in St. Albert's Apex Casino during a routine license plate check. He is the namesake of a defeated law, Wynn's Law, that would have made it more difficult for suspects to make bail if they had a criminal history. David Wynn was posthumously awarded a bravery award by the RCMP commissioner.  Background  Wynn was born in Newcastle, New Brunswick in 1972. Before becoming a police officer, Wynn was a paramedic for Emergency Health Services in Bridgewater, NS from between 1996 and 2009. In 2009 he joined the St. Albert RCMP.  Death  Const. David Wynn was shot in the head during a routine license plate check on January 17, 2015. He succumbed to his injuries four days later on January 21. = Apex Casino shooting = On January 17, 2015, Const. Wynn was at the Apex Casino in St. Albert, Alberta. He had been undergoing a routine check of the license plates in the parking lot — a common task on a slow night such as that one — when he found a plate that was not registered to the truck it was on. Suspecting vehicle theft, he went inside the casino to check the video footage. A second officer, Aux. Const. Derek Bond, was called in to help review the tape. At around 3 am, the two officers identified the man, who was still in casino at the time. They chased after the man, who fled. When Wynn tried to grab the suspect by the arm, the man turned around and shot him in the head. Bond attempted to subdue the shooter, but in the struggle was shot in the torso and right arm. The shooter fled the casino to an unoccupied home, where he shot himself. Police found the body shortly after when they identified the stolen vehicle outside the home. The man was identified the next day as Shawn Rehn, a 34 year old career criminal. Later that day, it was announced that Const. Wynn was not expected to survive. On January 19, Wynn's family gathered to say their final goodbyes. Over the next several days, words of support came from across the country. Wynn was taken off life support on January 21, 2015. = Funeral = The funeral saw attendance numbers in the thousands. Among notable attendees were then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and then Alberta Premier Jim Prentice. The service was held at Servus Credit Union Place, and was broadcast across the country.  Wynn's Law  Wynn's Law was a proposed piece of legislation that ultimately was not passed. Bill S-217 was defeated in the house of commons on June 14, 2017. The bill was introduced by Senator Bob Runciman on February 3, 2016, and was sponsored by MP Michael Cooper. The bill was to make changes to the Criminal Code that would have made it mandatory to disclose a suspect's criminal history during a bail hearing. It was named after Wynn because his killer Shawn Rehn had been out on bail at the time of the shootings, despite having many previous charges. It was argued that these previous charges should have been disclosed at Rehn's bail hearing, and that such a change may have prevented Wynn's death. The bill was championed by Wynn's wife Shelly, who at times through the process voiced her displeasure at the Liberal government, who were accused of opposing the bill on political grounds. The liberal government had previously stated that they would not support the law.  Awards  = Bravery award = Const. David Wynn was posthumously given a bravery award by the RCMP Commissioner in March, 2019. The award recognized both him and Auxiliary Const. Derek Bond for engaging an armed suspect after being fired upon. Two of Wynn's sons, Nathan and Matthew, accepted the award on his behalf.

He served The North China Mission. His spouse, Dr. Lucinda L. Combs Stritmatter, was the first physician assigned to China by the Women's Foreign Ministry Society. They married in 1877. Reverend Stritmatter had two sons both of whom were born abroad in China. He died in Denver, Colorado after traveling home to Ohio following an infection of tuberculosis. His grave is located in Denver, Colorado.  Early life  Andrew Stritmatter was born to Methodist parents Thomas and Margaret StritmatterYear: 1850; Census Place: North Sewickley, Beaver, Pennsylvania; Roll: M432_750; Page: 160B; Image: 320 in Pennsylvania on October 31, 1847. When he was a young boy, his parents relocated their family to Ohio. He enrolled at Ohio State University. At Ohio State, the Reverend Mr. Brown, a missionary of many years in India came to speak and upon hearing his lecture, Stritmatter was convinced of his calling to missionary work.  Missionary Life  = Appointment = In 1872, he met with Bishop I.W Wiley whom he asked for approval to serve as a missionary in China. The mission appointed him to Kiukiang, China thereafter. He embarked on his journey on June 5, 1873National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington D.C.; Roll #: 196; Volume #: Roll 196 - 11 Jun 1873-30 Jun 1873 from San Francisco accompanied by other missionaries.

It is the newest of 5 general campuses in the University of the West Indies system.  History  Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne approached the UWI to establish a campus in the country. In fact, the Prime Minister stated that if the UWI was not willing to be a partner to establish a university in Antigua and Barbuda, he would seek another partner. As the UWI vice-chancellor noted, the post- secondary education participation rate of students of the OECS sub-region was significantly below that of the countries with landed campuses and even the rest of the hemisphere. Data backs up that the average tertiary gross enrolment rates (GER) for Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago are much higher than the GERs for other contributing countries that do not have a landed campus. Other attempts to establish UWI campuses, such as in Grenada, have been considered but not yet fulfilled.Government hands over land to UWI Friday, July 20, 2012, St. George's, GrenadaGrenada Hands Over Land for University of the West Indies Campus The ability to complete the first one or two years of a degree or even a full degree in a student's home country is a significant cost saving for the student and the government, where it provides student financial assistance. Positioning the UWI campus at an already constructed complex reduces the needs for new construction, saving the government further money. However, the Prime Minister is continuing to seek funding to expand the campus, including a possible USD 20 million donation from China. On 27 May 2019, the University Finance and General Purposes Committee (UF&GPC;) of the UWI System approved the establishment of Five Islands campus. The first group of 147 admitted students were matriculated on 27 September 2019 and are currently pursuing studies in the Schools of Humanities and Education; Management, Sciences and Technology; and Health and Behavioural Sciences.  Campus  The UWI Five Islands campus is sited 7.5 km from the capital, St. John's, co-located with a campus of the Antigua State College. The building itself was originally built by a Chinese state construction firm for a secondary school that was never opened, due to a change of government. Instead, it was retrofitted and transferred to the College. Built to accommodate up to 750 students, it consists of 6,450 square- metres and has various regular and specialised learning spaces. The College's schools of business, education and nursing are presently located in the complex. As many of these students are enrolled in the first two years of franchised UWI programmes, they will be able to complete their degree programmes without having to leave the country.  Global initiatives  Harvard University has expressed willingness with UWI Five Islands to work out cooperation arrangements that would benefit the University, in acknowledgment of Harvard University’s historical relationship with slavery, particularly confronting past injustices and their legacies. The Harvard Law School was founded on an endowment in 1815 that was funded from slavery on the Isaac Royall Jr.’s plantation on Antigua.  Schools and programmes  Tuition for Bachelor’s degree programmes at UWI Five Islands is the lowest among all the landed units of the UWI System. In an effort to make the University more attractive, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda said it will be offering scholarships to students from across six countries of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Unlike the other landed campuses of the UWI, which have faculties, the Five Islands campus is composed of three schools: = School of Humanities and Education = * Bachelor of Education  Mathematics specialisation  Language and Literacy specialisation  Curriculum specialisation = School of Management, Science and Technology = * Bachelor of Social Sciences  Economics  Computer Science  Information Technology  Accounting  Finance  Banking  Management  Marketing  Tourism and Hospitality. = School of Health and Behavioural Sciences = * Bachelor of Nursing  See also  *University of the West Indies *Antigua State College References  External links  * Category:Universities in Antigua and Barbuda Category:University of the West Indies Category:2019 establishments in North America Category:Education in Antigua and Barbuda Category:Educational institutions established in 2019 Category:2019 establishments in the Caribbean ","title":"University of the West Indies at Five Islands"},{"id":"62603554","text":"Bunty Aur Babli 2 is an upcoming Indian Hindi-language crime comedy film produced by Aditya Chopra.

After receiving a scholarship from the city of Kraków, he went to study at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich.Parys Filippi, Matrikelbuch 1841-1884, Akademie der Bildenden Künste in München When he returned home, he opened a sculpture studio in the refectory of the Church of St. Francis of Assisi. which became a popular meeting place for many of the city's young artists, including Jan Matejko. Later, it would become involved with those planning the January Uprising.Michał Rożek, Przewodnik po zabytkach i kulturze Krakowa, Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, Warsaw, 1997 pg. 276 . During these years, he created numerous small to medium projects for the local churches and nobility, including series of busts for the Potocki and Sapieha families, as well as busts of nine Polish kings, based on their tombstones. After the uprising had been quashed, he restored the 18th century tomb of Cardinal and completed the tombstone for General Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki that had been left unfinished by Władysław Oleszczyński. In 1866, he moved to Lwów, where he opened a studio and gave lessons. As before, his studio became a meeting place for many young artists and intellectuals, including the sculptors Tadeusz Błotnicki, and . In 1867, he became a member of the \\"Society of Friends of the Fine Arts\\". During these years, he focused on creating busts and portrait medallions of notable people. Plaster casts of the medallions were very popular. He also created a few tombstones for Łyczakow Cemetery; notably that of Artur Grottger. In addition, he was involved in several major conservation and restoration projects. Having long suffered from alcoholism, he became severely depressed and committed suicide, while away from home, performing conservation work in Warsaw. He left behind a pregnant widow and three children. Many of his works were stolen from their owners during World War II. Those that have been recovered are on display at the Lviv National Art Gallery.  References   Further reading  * Słownik Artystów Polskich i Obcych w Polsce Działających.

A Chorochromatic map (from Greek χώρα [khṓra, “location”] and χρῶμα [khrôma, “color”]), also known as an area- class or qualitative area maps, is a type of thematic map that portray regions of categorical or nominal data using variations in color symbols. Chorochromatic maps are typically used to represent discrete fields, also known as categorical coverages. Chorochromatic maps differ from choropleth maps in that chorochromatic maps are mapped according to data-driven boundaries instead of trying to make the data fit within existing, sometimes arbitrary units such as political boundaries.  Use of chorochromatic maps  Chorochromatic maps are used to depict a wide variety of nominal/discrete fields. Like a quantitative field, a discrete field is a property that varies over space and theoretically possesses a measurable value at any location. However, the value, in this case, is nominal or categorical, and due to the typical presence of Tobler's first law of geography, there are usually regions of homogeneous value. Because of the constant value in the data, discrete values represent features that have definite boundaries in chorochromatic maps, and the data shows the measures of a defined area. Discrete data can only take some values and these ones can be counted but not measured, which make it easy to categorize them into classifications. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution- ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. The chorochromatic technique in cartography implies the drawing of boundaries to establish specific areas where shading or coloring techniques are applied to distinguish unique features. Examples of discrete fields that are commonly depicted using chorochromatic maps include: *Biomes *Climate classification * Land cover, such as vegetation, water, and human landscape * Predominant language, religion, ethnicity or other cultural trait * Soil type * surface geologic strata * Land use * city zoning Some discrete fields are hierarchical meaning some values are more similar than others (e.g., geologic strata by age, language families), while others consist of entirely independent values. In the hierarchical case, a wise choice of map symbols such as similar colors (e.g. similar shades of red) can help to portray the hierarchy effectively. The regions depicted on a chorochromatic map are very scale-dependent, as the cartographer or data collector must determine the minimum size of regions to represent, with small regions merged into the surrounding regions. For example, on a county-scale land use map, a single farm house would not be shown amid several square miles of farmland, whereas on a land use map focused on that farmland, the house might be significant to show. On a land use map of an entire country, the farmland itself would probably not be large enough to show. As with all forms of Cartographic generalization, this can lead to uncertainty and misinterpretation if not done wisely.  Simple and compound chorochromatic maps  Chorochromatic maps can be categorized as either simple or compound. = Simple chorochromatic = Example of a simple chorochromatic map showing the distribution and location of active surface coal fields in the United States circa 2012. Simple chorochromatic maps show single features with spatially intermittent frequencies. An example of this would be showing the distribution of a nation's forest reserves. The chosen variable is represented by a single color symbol or pattern without subdividing it further into subgroups. = Compound chorochromatic = Example of a compound chorochromatic map. The 21 distinct water resource regions of the United States inhabit spatially unique areas and are symbolized by a unique color value.Compound chorochromatic maps on the other hand show phenomena in which types and categories can be recognized. Chorochromatic maps can be used to show different types of soil, rocks, vegetation, etc. One example would be a full vegetation map, in which the different kinds of vegetation are all shown on the same map, using different symbols or shading patterns. Usually, the classification resulting in the identification of the unit types shown on a compound chorochromatic map is qualitative, based on apparently discontinuous features. However, in certain cases (for example, soil and vegetation) the aggregate unit area characteristics form parts of a continuum.  Selection of Thematic Map Type  Because most types of thematic maps are designed to portray quantitative data, one could assume that a nominal variable would dictate the creation of a chorochromatic map. However, choropleth maps can be used to portray nominal data that is created by aggregating and summarizing a geographic variable within predetermined districts. The critical difference between each, then, lies in the nature of the geographical unit used in each. As an example, a Primary Language variable in census data could be aggregated into the predominant spoken language in each county in a country, then visualized in a choropleth map. Conversely, in a chorochromatic map, the regions would be drawn based on detailed geographic data. Thus, a chorochromatic map of predominant language would have irregular boundaries based on where the language regions are located in reality.  Misinterpretation of chorochromatic maps  Chorochromatic maps, like other thematic maps, have the potential to be misinterpreted by their readers. For example, the map reader may assume that the size of a given area is proportional to the number of people in the area with a qualitative characteristic such as language or religious belief. To avoid misleading a map user, a cartographer may choose to add a diagram showing the actual numbers involved and additional explanations in the legend or map layout to help to create a clear understanding of the map. Another danger of chorochromatic maps is that they may suggest defined boundaries between variables where none may exist. Some variables when mapped, particularly language, can suggest to the viewer a rigidity to the borders between features that may or may not exist in reality. When areas of uncertainty are present, cartographers may need to employ other techniques to suggest a degree of uncertainty between each feature.
