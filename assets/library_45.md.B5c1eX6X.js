He commanded the 7th Panzer Division and was one of only 27 German military men to receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. Career Mauss volunteered for service in World War I in 1914 at the age of sixteen. He joined Lauenburger J√§ger-Bataillon Nr. 9 of Ratzeburg, serving on the Western Front. In 1915, the youngest man in the division, he was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd class as the best scout in the region during the Battle of the Somme. The following year, shortly after the transfer of his division to the Eastern Front, he received the Iron Cross, 1st class. Following World War I Mauss joined the paramilitary groups Freikorps Oberland and Marinebrigade Ehrhardt and fought against the Silesian Uprisings. Beginning in 1922, he studied dentistry at the University of Hamburg, attaining his doctorate in 1929 and opening a private dental practice. He re- enlisted in 1934, and reached the rank of major in April 1938. At the start of the war, Mauss served with the 20th Motorized Infantry Division, with which he participated in the 1939 Invasion of Poland. In May 1940 his 10th Panzer Division took part in the Battle of France together with Heinz Guderian's XIX Army Corps. In the second phase of the campaign, Mauss participated in the battles against the French 7th Army. Mauss took part in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.

He is probably remembered best for his role as the blustery newspaper editor Perry White in the 1950s television program Adventures of Superman. Biography John Hamilton was born in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania to John M. Hamilton and his wife Cornelia J. (Hollar) Hamilton. Hamilton was the youngest of four children, and his mother died eight days after his birth. His father remarried and Rosa, his stepmother, was the only mother the young Hamilton knew.United States Census records for 1900, Franklin County, Pennsylvania Hamilton grew up in neighboring Southampton Township Pennsylvania, where his father worked as a store clerk. Hamilton's father was also appointed Shippensburg's trustee for the State Superintendent of Public Education, so it was a foregone conclusion that Hamilton would receive extensive schooling. Unlike most others of his generation and background (Southampton being a farming community), Hamilton attended college Dickinson College and Shippensburg State Teacher's College. He opted to forgo teaching for a stage career, however. After becoming an actor, he worked in Broadway plays and in touring theatrical companies for many years prior to his 1930 movie debut. He was in the original Broadway company of the 1922 play Seventh Heaven and would appear in the movie remake (Seventh Heaven) in 1937. He featured with Donald Meek in a series of short mysteries based on S.S. Van Dine stories for Warner Bros. He was often typecast in the role of an authority figure; to wit, prison warden, judge, politician or police chief, but played various types of characters, appearing in more than three hundred movies, movie serials or television programs from the 1930s through the 1950s. As an example, he does a brief turn in robes as the judge who passes sentence on soon-to-be-racketeer James Cagney for violation of the Volstead Act in \\"The Roaring Twenties\\" (1939). Hamilton appeared as a police inspector in the John Huston film In This Our Life in 1942, and got several lines as DA Bryan quizzing Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade in \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" (1941). Modern-day serial fans can see Hamilton's iconic persona already developing as Professor Gordon, the outwardly no- nonsense but secretly compassionate father of young, man-of-action Flash Gordon in Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940). He became much more widely known when he was cast as the irascible Daily Planet newspaper editor Perry White in the 1950s TV classic Adventures of Superman (1951). After that, he appeared in television commercials for a brand of bifocals termed \\"Inviso No-Line Glasses\\". (The idea was to render invisible the seam in the lens \\"that tells the world you're over forty\\".) Hamilton is often confused with John F. Hamilton, an American actor who made a few films, and with John Hamilton, a British actor who played juvenile roles in the UK and Europe in the 1930s. Death John Hamilton died on October 15, 1958 in Glendale, California of heart failure at the age of 71. He was survived by a son. He was interred in Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

Scribonius Libo (praetor 80 BC) Lucius Scribonius Libo (fl. 1st century BC) was a member of a Roman Senatorial family, and held the office of praetor urbanus in 80 BC.T. R. S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol III, pg. 185 He is known to have had at least one son of the same name, who became consul in 34 BC. He is also cited as the most likely candidate for the father of Scribonia, second wife of Augustus and mother of his only biological child, Julia the Elder. If so, then he would have married at least once to a woman of the Sentia gens, whose ancestors had been directors of the mint.CIL 6.31276: Sentia Lib[onis] mater Scr[iboniae] Caes[aris]. In 62 BC Scribonius was made monetalis during which he repaired the Puteal Scribonianum and issued coins to commemorate the event.T. R. S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Vol III, pg. 186 L. Scribonius Libo (consul 34 BC) Lucius Scribonius Libo (fl. 1st century BC) was the son of the above, and possibly the elder brother or half-brother of Scribonia, first wife of Augustus. His wife was a member of the gens Sulpicia. When the civil war broke in 49 BC he sided with Pompey and was in command of Etruria. Afterward he accompanied Pompey to Greece. Following the death of Bibulus he was given command of the Pompeian fleet. During the civil wars that occurred after the assassination of Julius Caesar, he sided with his son-in- law Sextus Pompey (married to his daughter Scribonia). In 40 BC Octavian, married his sister and she bore him his only natural child Julia. After this marriage a peace was made between the Triumvirs (second triumvirate) and Sextus with the Pact of Misenum in 39 BC. After the war was renewed in 36 BC, Scribonius felt the cause was lost and abandoned Sextus. In 34 BC he was consul with Mark Antony. L. Scribonius Libo (consul 16 AD) Lucius Scribonius Libo (died 16 AD) was a consul in 16. This nobleman was brother of Marcus Scribonius Libo, who was accused of planning to revolt against Emperor Tiberius.

Auel published in 1990. It is the sequel to The Mammoth Hunters and fourth in the Earth's Children series.  Plot  The Plains of Passage describes the journey of Ayla and Jondalar west along the Great Mother River (the Danube), from the home of The Mammoth Hunters (roughly modern Ukraine) to Jondalar's homeland (close to Les Eyzies, Dordogne, France). During this journey, Ayla meets the various peoples who live along their line of march. These meetings, the attitudes and beliefs of these groups, and Ayla's response form an essential part of the story. Characters range in description from innocent to bloodthirsty, from serious to comical, from noble to corrupt, from found to lost, and from peaceful to violent. All of these adjectives apply in some way to either Jondalar or Ayla. Ayla (and to some extent Jondalar) is often viewed by her new friends as mystic or supernatural, partially due to her friendships with the world's first known domesticated horses and wolf, but also due to her generous nature and wisdom. As they encounter people Jondalar and his brother met on their journey eastward they have a hard time leaving them, especially after an offer to become joined with a high-ranking Sharamudoi couple. Jondalar declines the offer, giving as excuse his desire to have the lead mystic of his people search for and help his deceased brother cross over to the other side. It concludes with Ayla and Jondalar's successful return to the Zelandoni, and Ayla's stated pregnancy, and Whinney's definite pregnancy. The Plains of Passage is one of the longer books in the Earth's Children series. It was followed by The Shelters of Stone. Critical Response Entertainment Weekly gave the novel a B+ upon its release in 1990, saying it has a \\"low- intensity fascination [similar to] an actual hike through the wilderness\\".The Plains of Passage Entertainment Weekly also claims \\"Auel's main strength is melodrama that has been enlisted in the service of a serious, improving message that a lot of people want to receive. In Auel's case the didactic component is a postfeminist allegory that validates Woman's new place in society, with one foot in the (hunting/ gathering) workplace and the other still solidly planted on the domestic hearth\\". Auel is often praised for her knowledge on the Paleolithic, and this chapter in the Earth's Children series is no exception. Public Response \\"The Plains of Passage\\" spent weeks on the New York Times best sellers list from 1990‚Äì1991.BEST SELLERS: February 3, 1991BEST SELLERS: May 5, 1991 The novel currently holds a 3.7/5 on Goodreads The Plains of Passage and a 4.5/5 on the Barnes and Noble website. Many readers found this book to have tedious details and meticulous information, but was enjoyable overall.

The C79 sight is not designed as a sniper sight per se, but is rather intended to be mounted on a variety of rifles and to be used by regular infantrymen as well as designated marksmen. The M145 machine gun optic differs from the C79's standard 3.4x sight in that ballistic compensation is provided for in the reticle, rather than in the mount.

This included asking a fortune-teller if he would be rich enough to pave the Via Appia, as far as Brundisium or Brindisi with money. Tacitus described the accusations against Libo as 'preposterous' and 'pointless'. The two men were tried in a senatorial court by the Emperor Tiberius. At the trial, Marcus was ill and pleaded for mercy. A maternal relative, Publius Sulpicius Quirinus, defended them and appealed to the Emperor. Tiberius told him to apply to the senate. Tiberius wanted to investigate Libo's slaves but there was a senatorial decree preventing confessions from tortured slaves from being used in trials against their own masters. To get around this Tiberius had Libo's slaves sold to the treasury agent, then the accusations made against Libo were considered confirmed by Libo's ex slaves. His aunt, Scribonia (second wife of Roman Emperor Augustus), tried to convince Marcus to face trial rather than commit suicide. However, Marcus committed suicide by stabbing himself twice in the stomach on 13 September 16 AD. The Roman Senate agreed to divide his property among his accusers, which was the common practice of the time. Furthermore, his statue and funeral masks were removed from descendants' funeral parades and members of the gens ‚ÄòScribonius‚Äô were forbidden to bear the name ‚ÄòDrusus‚Äô. His supporters were executed, and the day of his death was declared a public holiday.

It was founded in the 1870s. St. Paul's Methodist Church and its home on Avenue Road just north of Bloor Street in the Yorkville community, was built in 1877. With church union in 1925, it became St. Paul's United and in 1930 it merged with the nearby Avenue Road (formerly Presbyterian Church) and became St. Paul's-Avenue Road United. Originally the church was that of many of Toronto's elite, but the church began to decline in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1980 the congregation merged with Trinity United Church on Bloor, west of Spadina Avenue to form Trinity-St. Paul's United Church. The congregation was based in the former Trinity building, and St. Paul's was sold to developers. An acclaimed heritage property, there were several years of debate over what could be done with the structure. The developers hoped to demolish it, but this was blocked by the community and city council. The church became a gallery for the arts and music for several years. In 1995, the building was destroyed by fire. Accusations of arson were leveled. The destruction of the church, leaving it open for development, tripled the value of the property overnight. The insurance company refused to pay for the damage after it found evidence that the fire was deliberate. The property was developed and today a retirement home known as Hazelton Place stands in the location.

Plot Boisterous gangster kingpin 'Bull' Weed rehabilitates the down-and-out 'Rolls Royce' Wensel, a former lawyer who has fallen into alcoholism. The two become confidants, with Rolls Royce's intelligence aiding Weed's schemes, but complications arise when Rolls Royce falls for Weed's girlfriend 'Feathers' McCoy. Adding to Weed's troubles are attempts by a rival gangster, 'Buck' Mulligan, to muscle in on his territory. Their antagonism climaxes with Weed killing Mulligan and he is imprisoned, awaiting a death sentence.

Lee with titles by George Marion Jr.. It was produced by B. P. Schulberg and Hector Turnbull with cinematography by Bert Glennon and edited by E. Lloyd Sheldon.Sarris, 1966. p. 13 Sternberg completed Underworld in a record-setting five weeks.Baxter, 1971. p. 37, 43 The gangster role played by George Bancroft was modeled on \\"Terrible\\" Tommy O'Connor, an Irish-American mobster who gunned down Chicago Police Chief Padraig O'Neil in 1923 but escaped three days before execution and was never apprehended. Paramount Pictures, initially cool towards the production, predicted the film would fail. Initial release was limited to only one theater, the New York Paramount. The studio did not provide advance publicity. Writer Ben Hecht requested (unsuccessfully) to have his name taken off the credits, due to the dismal prospects for the film. Reception Contrary to studio expectations, the public response to the New York screening was so positive that Paramount arranged for round-the-clock showings at the Paramount Theatre to \\"accommodate the unexpected crowds that flocked to the attraction.\\"Rodriguez-Ortega, 2005. Sarris, 1966. p. 13 Time felt the film was realistic in some parts, but disliked the Hollywood clich√© of turning an evil character's heart to gold at the end.Time, \\"New Pictures: Sep. 5, 1927\\" Underworld was well-received overseas, especially in France, where directors Julien Duvivier and Marcel Carn√© were deeply impressed with Sternberg's \\"clinical and spartan\\" film technique. Filmmaker and surrealist Luis Bu√±uel named Underworld as his all time favorite film. Paramount, overjoyed at the film's \\"critical and commercial success\\" bestowed a gold medal and a $10,000 bonus on Sternberg.Baxter, 1971. p. 43-44Weinberg, 1967. p. 34 Ben Hecht won the Academy Award for Writing in the 1st Academy Awards ceremony in 1929 for his work on this film.Baxter, 1971. p. 43 In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list. Theme Sternberg has been credited with \\"launching the gangster film genre.\\"Axmater, 2010. Film Sufi, 2013. Rodriguez-Ortega, 2005 Critic Andrew Sarris cautions that Underworld is \\"less a proto-gangster film than a pre-gangster film\\" in which the criminal world of the Prohibition Era provides a backdrop for a tragic tale of a \\"Byronic hero\\" destroyed, not by \\"the avenging forces of law and order\\" but by the eternal vicissitudes of \\"love, faith and falsehood.\\"Axmaker, 2010: \\"A tale of loyalty and love in a violent world.\\" Sarris, 1966. p. 15-16 Journalist Ben Hecht's influence appears in the phony flower shop operation and killing of \\"Bull\\" Weed's archenemy, \\"florist\\" Buck Mulligan, evoking the 1922 real-life murder of kingpin Dion O'Bannon by the Tony Torrios mob.Baxter, 1971. P. 38 Funeral hearses also abound in the film, notorious as capacious conveyances used to conceal criminal activities and personnel in Chicago. Despite these contemporary references, Underworld does not qualify as \\"the first gangster film\\" as Sternberg \\"showed little interest in the purely gangsterish aspects of the genre\\" nor the \\"mechanics of [mob] power.\\"Sarris, 1966. P. 15Baxter, 1971. P. 43 Rather than invoking contemporary social forces and inequities, Sternberg's \\"Bull\\" Weed is subject to \\"implacable Fate\\", much as the heroes of classical antiquity.Sarris, 1966. p. 15-16: \\"... steers clear of sociological implications of his material. ... \\" and \\"law and order ... never related to society but rather to an implacable Fate ...\\"Jeanne and Ford, 1965. in Weinberg, 1967. p. 211: Characters \\"moved ... by extreme violence\\" as one finds in \\"the heroes of antiquity [where] fate destines them to the worst catastrophes.\\" The female companions to the outlaws are less gangster molls, addicted to violent men, but protagonists in their own right, who induce \\"revenge and redemption.\\" The genre would only be properly established in such film classics as Little Caesar (1930), The Public Enemy (1931), Scarface (1932), High Sierra (1941), White Heat (1949), The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and The Killing (1956).Sarris, 1966.

A new group of Toa must find the Mask of Life that can save him before it is too late, but other, more sinister groups also desire such a powerful mask for their own purposes.

Legends =Plot Summary (2006)= Island of Doom The reconstruction of Metru Nui is underway as the Turaga call a meeting with the Toa Nuva and Toa Takanuva. Turaga Dume and Nuju reveal their discovery. By studying the stars, they have found the Great Spirit has fallen from his coma-like state and is dying. After his death, the universe will die along with it in three days. His only chance of survival is if the Toa Nuva recover the legendary Kanohi Ignika, the Mask of Life, to save him. Dume leads the Toa Nuva underground to Toa Canisters and sends them off to the island of Voya Nui while Toa Takanuva stays behind to guard the metropolis. On Voya Nui, the Piraka, Zaktan, Avak, Thok, Reidak, Vezok, and Hakann, arrive and masquerade as Toa. Despite their claims, it is their frightening appearance and demeanor which primarily makes the Matoran natives fall into the Piraka's plot. Thus, the Matoran survivalists are convinced, and begin the construction of the Piraka's fortress, the Stronghold, as well as temples and statues in their honor. They are also used to dig trenches for \\"lava-farming\\" out of Mount Valmai to search for the Ignika. This makes six Matoran suspicious of their claims, and form the \\"Voya Nui Resistance Team\\". They watch the Piraka closely and take place in the theft of a mysterious artifact they created, a Zamor Launcher, ultimately believing they will use the weapon against them. Meanwhile, in Metru Nui, Jaller‚Äîa Ta-Matoran and close friend to Takanuva, the Toa of Light‚Äîbegins to suspect that the Turaga were hiding something from the Matoran. He and Takanuva confronted them about this but when the Turaga refusedto reveal the truth, Jaller staged a Metru-wide boycott (i.e. the Matoran all stop repairing the damage to Metru Nui) and would not end it until the Turaga tell the Mataoran what's going on. After skirmishes with the Piraka, including Dalu's attempt to increase Avak's senses, Hakann and Avak create a monster of rock and lava to fool the Matoran, and defeat the monster, hopefully to better the Piraka's image. Using Antidermis, a mysterious substance that the Piraka have found on the island, Zaktan creates a Zamor Sphere to test upon a Ta-Matoran subject named Dezalk, which makes the Matoran obedient and loyal, sending him to assemble the Matoran where the Piraka enslave the Voya Nui Matoran save the resistance team. Meanwhile, the Toa Nuva arrive, and despite the Resistance Team's intervention, are surprised and defeated by the Piraka after a fierce battle. Zaktan commands their tools and Kanohi are to be stripped, and the Toa Nuva to burn in Mt. Valmai. During this time, Balta, in an attempt to steal a Zamor Sphere, traps himself in a cave. Back on Metru Nui, Jaller organizes a labor strike until the Turaga divulge the Toa Nuva's sudden disappearance, believing the Matoran have been protected too closely for far too long. Turaga Nokama meets with Jaller secretly to reveal the truth about Mata Nui and the Toa Nuva's mission. Dark Destiny On Metru Nui, Turaga Dume holds a conference with the Turaga. He reviews the events of the previous meeting and confesses his doubts on the Toa Nuva, who have not returned with the Ignika. More importantly, he accuses the Turaga of revealing this, as Takanuva and Jaller recruited 5 of the breavest Matoran to mount a rescue mission; the team departed the night before, vanishing into the Underwater Chutes of Le-Metru. Nokama confesses, and the Turaga are forced to wait as Takanuva is not available to dispatch. At the same time, Takanuva, Jaller and the other 5 Matoran emerges from a Chute onto a land bridge. Takanuva attempts to unsuccessfully persuade Jaller to return to Metru Nui and let him continue the mission, and scouts ahead up a tunnel. When he uses his Light powers to illuminate the tunnel, he finds his Light powers are disabled in the tunnel, and becomes disoriented and confused. After a while, the Matoran team decide to enter the tunnel, their Lightstones fail, and they link themselves with cable and continue to talk to ensure they would not become separated. Matoro, one of the six Matoran, is worried as Nuju said the way to Voya Nui was through a \\"land of the dead\\", but is ignored. He then no longer hears his allies' voices even when he shouts, and stumbles in the darkness. He feels a hand grab out to him and helps the figure to his feet, and continues to follow the cable, where the Matoran and Takanuva await. The figure is no longer in the tunnel, and is revealed to be an extension of the Kanohi Ignika. They continue down a long strip of land, with a stone archway far away. Jaller offers if anyone wants to turn away do so now, but no one declines. Hahli wonders about Takanuva and Teridax, and if Teridax's defeat was intentional, and Hewkii finds a Kanohi Suletu, Takanuva acknowledging its existence by wearing the Kanohi and listening on Hahli's thoughts. The team sets down close to the Archway, Jaller standing guard as the Matoran slept. Jaller questions Matoro's attitude after they escaped the tunnel, but they are interrupted by Takanuva sighting a Matoran in the archway, which awakens the others. They continue toward the Archway, Takanuva explaining that the Matoran disappeared before contact was made, and he attempts to pass through the Archway only to be repelled, along with the power of light. The Matoran pass through the Archway, but are unable to get back. Hahli warns them from a tablet she found, describing that \\"This is a realm of shadow ... of famine and plague and blight ... This is a world of darkness ... and there is no place for light.\\" Sadly, Takanuva is forced to depart for Metru Nui again and the Matoran continue onward, with a message to update the Turaga and not send any assistance. The team continues up a mountain, and are met by eight Manas. They are led into a canyon of Matoran in various states of disrepair. The land is desolate, waterfalls of dust, volcanoes of hot ice, thunderless lighting and thunder- producing water. The ground screams as they walk past stone statues of Matoran and the un-repaired Matoran follow them. They are led to an armored being, with a horrific patch-work mask and chains of fire. His name is Karzahni, the ruler of this land named in his honor. Hahli remembers this place from the Turaga's tales, where \\"lazy\\" Matoran were sent. Karzahni describes a hundred thousand years ago, Matoran of laziness and disrepair were sent here, and when the team mentions Mata Nui would not accept such a place, he is confused. The Matoran then confiscate the Matoran's supplies and tools (to strip their identity), and when asked for their masks, Jaller refuses, knowing that his Kanohi Hau was belonged to the late Toa Lhikan. He is forced to carry out his wishes when Karzahni gives him a vision of an alternate future where Takua dies. The Matoran are re-purposed, Hahli works with Karzahni. As the Chronicler, she educates him in the events of the past hundred centuries. The other Matoran are put to work in the furnaces, where they meet an Av-Matoran who resided there before the light-barrier Archway was constructed. With his mind broken, he rambles about his previous identity, working in a \\"world that feeds the world\\" where he constructed the Toa Canisters. He reveals a set where hidden in Karzahni, and despite his warnings that Matoran would not survive the journey, they journey underground to them. Karzahni tries to stop them, but when Matoro goads him, he gives a vision of the death of the Great Spirit and its effects. The vision is so appalling that the tyrant hesitates, and Jaller's team escape for Voya Nui. On Voya Nui, the Piraka carry the unconscious Toa Nuva to Mt. Valmai, but an eruption stops them from doing so, and they flee. The Toa Nuva regain consciousness in time to save themselves. After recovering, the run into the Voya Nui Resistance Team, but the group believes them as threats as well, and they attack the Toa Nuva, who refuse to retliate against that which they chose to protect. Gali Nuva is driven insane when Dalu enhances her sight, and flees from the area, coming into the custody of Axonn, who heals her and frees Balta from the cave. The two return to the conflict and the Toa Nuva and Matoran ally, and they journey for the Piraka's Stronghold to find the Nuva's Kanohi and tools. Meanwhile, Zaktan is furious upon the Toa Nuva's survival. He reveals the Piraka's seventh member, Vezon, briefly, and sends Thok to work the Matoran harder, as the volcano had slowed after the eruption. Zaktan later meets with Brutaka, and Hakann overhears. He fires a Zamor Sphere at the titan, which only appears to make him stronger. He follows the gold and blue armored warrior, and strikes a deal that if he can control the Zamor Spheres, he can grant them to Brutaka, they too journey to the Stronghold. Coincidentally, Avak and Thok, searching for the Toa by the green belt of Voya Nui, realize the Ignika must be hidden there, and conclude Zaktan was using Mount Valmai as a diversion. They retreat to the Piraka Stronghold to confront him. A battle begins within the Stronghold between the Piraka. Reidak attempts to enter the Stronghold and encounters the Toa Nuva, accidentally aiding them in getting inside. The Toa Nuva recover their tools and masks. Zaktan once again resumes control of Brutaka, offering the secret of Antidermis. Brutaka defeats the Toa Nuva and the Matoran, and he takes the Toa into his custody. The Piraka, whose loose alliance is now on the verge of being completely broken, interrogate the Matoran. Just offshore from Voya Nui, the transport pods carrying Jaller and the others arrives just as the mysterious Red Star shoots a bolt of energy at the canisters. The bolt splits into six and strikes them. When the Matoran emerged, they were no longer Matoran, but Toa. Power Play From afar, Axonn watches the defeat of the Toa Nuva and the Voya Nui Resistance Team. He reflects upon how they ended up there. Axonn and Brutaka are part of an organization named the Order of Mata Nui, devoted to the Great Spirit. They were assigned to protect the Kanohi Ignika on Voya Nui, unfortunately, Brutaka lost faith within their mission, as Voya Nui separated itself from the Southern Continent and the Great Cataclysm. Soon, Brutaka betrayed his mission to ally himself with the Piraka to ultimately steal the Kanohi Ignika. Brutaka, as well ponders his history, while aiding the Piraka in interrogating the Voya Nui Resistance Team, and when Dalu attempts an escape, he saves her from a Doom Viper. He leaves, troubled by his choices. After the incident, Garan is questioned, and the Piraka are troubled by the sight of six Spirit Stars, specifically the Toa Inika's. Vezok attempts to throw him in a crevice of lava, but he is rescued by the Voya Nui Resistance Team. Meanwhile, the Toa Inika start to figure out their next move; noting especially odd things about their transformation like glowing faces and living masks. They end up triggering their mask powers, causing chaos as Nuparu flies uncontrollably, Kongu can't keep from hearing others' thoughts, Matoro's spirit is separated from his body, and Hahli seems to be talking to thin air. As they regain control, Matoro reports that he saw the Matoran, and the Toa agree that they need to meet them and figure out what's going on in this island. After a scuffle with Vezok, the Toa meet the Matoran rebels and compare notes on what they know. Armed with Zamor Launchers built by Velika, they split up into three groups: Jaller and Hahli go to free enslaved Matoran, Hewkii and Matoro go visit Axonn, and Kongu and Nuparu sneak into the Piraka stronghold to search for the Toa Nuva. While Jaller and Hahli's mission has no problems; Hewkii and Matoro find Axonn badly injured by Brutaka, telling them to stop his former partner even if it means killing him. Worse, Kongu and Nuparu are discovered and faced with all six Piraka and Brutaka. Thankfully, the other Toa arrive just as the battle starts and Hewkii is able to bury Brutaka under a pile of rock, taking him out of the fight temporarily. While the Matoran search the stronghold for the Toa Nuva, the Toa Inika, thanks to their unique mask powers and unpredictable fighting style due to their recent transformation, begin taking the Piraka out one by one. But the tides turn when Brutaka begins to dig himself out: Hakann enacts the plan to steal Brutaka's power for himself, Avak, Reidak, and Thok‚Äîbut he intended to take it all for himself, and only quick action by Thok allowed him to take a share of Brutaka's power as well. The two quickly use their new strength to turn on the others, with Hakann knocking them all out with one superpowered mental blast. When everyone comes to, they realize that Hakann and Thok had forced the weakened Brutaka to reveal the location of the Mask of Life. Axonn arrives and begins to go after the two Piraka, but Jaller tells him to swallow his pride and let others help, to which Axonn agrees. Realizing that the best way to stop the two is to return Brutaka's power to him and that the Piraka are the only ones who know how to do that, the two groups form an uneasy alliance. While the Piraka work on the Zamor Sphere that will depower Hakann and Thok, Axonn warns Jaller of the mask's guardians and hands him a glowing Zamor for \\"protection\\". At the same time, the Matoran are continuing their search, and they find records of Voya Nui's history - it was long thought that many were lost when some of the land sank underwater, but these records say that they may still be alive underwater as a prelude to the Mahri Nui story. Meanwhile, Hakann and Thok have begun to turn on each other. The resulting destruction makes them easy to track, and the Toa Inika and other Piraka quickly arrive on the scene (Axonn chose to stay behind). Though most of the Piraka are taken out of the fight early, Hakann and Thok are soon put at a disadvantage by the Inika. The two call a truce and launch a combined attack, but at the same moment Hewkii hits them with the specially prepared Zamor. As a result, both sides fall unconscious from their enemies' assault; leaving only Zaktan standing. By the time the Toa Inika awaken, the Piraka are already up and gone, headed down a staircase that leads to the Mask of Life. Agreeing that they can't wait for reinforcements, they quickly follow. Legacy Of Evil This portion of the storyline describes the Piraka's history, involvement in the Dark Hunters and subsequent betrayal and the events leading up to their journey to Voya Nui, described by Zaktan's experiences and tales of the Piraka, \\"a legacy of evil\\". The book was initially proposed to come with a Piraka Lego mini-figure.Farshtey, Greg (2006): \\"BIONICLE Legends 4: Legacy of Evil, . 7,000 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends: Vezok and Hakann, two Skakdi, raid a Toa fortress in search of an artifact. As Hakann creates a fracas to distract the Toa, Vezok finds the artifact, a tablet named the Makoki Stone, with barely discernible writing detailing the Brotherhood of Makuta, in the event that they would rebel. They depart the Fortress and are captured by the Dark Hunter \\"Ancient\\", who confiscates the artifact and recruits the Dark Hunters along with four Skakdi, Zaktan, Avak, Thok, and Reidak. 5,000 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends: Zaktan leads his Skakdi peers (minus Avak) in an unsuccessful maneuver to overthrow the Shadowed One, but are confused by the transforming walls of the fortress. The Shadowed One attempts to execute Zaktan for his treacherous leadership of the plot, but his disintegration vision instead transforms Zaktan into a mass of sentient protodites. 4,000 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends: In a blackmail scheme, the Shadowed One sends Reidak, Vezok, and Avak to free the Kanohi Dragon from imprisonment in the seas around Metru Nui, leaving the Rahi to rampage upon the city. When the trio meet with Turaga Dume to offer protection in the event the Dark Hunters' are allowed to establish a base, he declines. Therefore, Vezok attempts an assassination, but is unsuccessful due to the arrival of Toa Lhikan and his Toa Mangai team. The Toa eventually defeat the beast and deport it to Xia, where Roodaka awaits its arrival. 3,000 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends: The Toa/Dark Hunter War, beginning as a result of Dume refusing to establish Dark Hunter bases within Metru Nui, is well underway. Hakann oversees Nidhiki's betrayal and Lhikan overhearing the matter. He bargains with the Toa of Fire, Nidhiki for the Makoki Stone which Lhikan guarded long ago. He agrees, but six months later, the Dark Hunters have it within their possession again, split into six, and auctioned to the Brotherhood at a profitable price. Roodaka then mutates Nidhiki into an insectoid being, dooming him to a lifetime with the Hunters. 250 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends: Zaktan, Thok, and Reidak guard Odina against the Brotherhood during the Dark Hunter/Brotherhood War. As the Hunters' are occupied with an unsuccessful Brotherhood attack of Rahkski, Exo-Toa, and Visorak, Zaktan learns from Roodaka the base was initially in the possession of the Brotherhood. Zaktan investigates the matter and uses his protodite abilities to find an entire record of the Brotherhood and their Plan. Zaktan vows to use this knowledge to his nefarious ends. One month prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends: Zaktan recruits his five fellow Skakdi and rebel against the Hunters. Now rogue, they investigate Teridax's lair after his supposed death, which happens just as the Matoran arrive in Metru Nui. Hakann discovers the Spear of Fusion, and uses it on Vezok, dividing him into two beings, Vezok and Vezon (the latter taking his name as Vezon means \\"double\\" in Matoran). They encounter Teridax's essence as \\"Antidermis\\", who subconsciously plants in their minds the ideato go to Voya Nui for the Kanohi Ignika. The seven escape the lair as his Mana Ko come after them. They flee to the island of Mata Nui after Vezon gives them the slip, and find the Toa Mata's Toa Canisters, bringing them to the beach. Avak and Zaktan chart a course to Voya Nui and Zaktan informs the Piraka to masquerade as Toa on their arrival. Hakann uses his heat vision to create a small puncture in Vezok's canister as they depart, although this act fails to kill him. Present: The Piraka continue down the hall of 777 stairs to the Kanohi Ignika, and surmise that Vezon awaits them as they found another Toa Canister upon Voya Nui on their arrival. Zaktan lets Hakann lead the way, as he is plagued by the laughter of Teridax within his mind. Meanwhile, Avak discovers Hakann cowering in a corner, his armor gleaming with intense heat. Inferno The passages to the Kanohi Ignika's chamber are littered with traps and tests to keep the mask out of the wrong hands. The Piraka quickly face their greatest fears in the form of the mythical monster Irnakk. Only Zaktan's willingness to end his own cursed existence and everyone else's lives, thereby eliminating the fear that brought Irnakk to life and sustains him, allows the Piraka to pass the test and continue. In a later test, the Piraka fail due to their inability to trust one another; while they escape the resulting deathtrap they end up exposed to something that begins changing them... Meanwhile, the Toa Inika have their own tests to worry about. They soon come across a group of enemies that they had fought in their former Matoran lives, including a Rahkshi Turahk that had once killed Jaller during his search for the Toa of Light. Jaller is able to overcome this disturbing memory, but like all the other Inika, his powers go out of control and end up killing his opponent. Adding to their shame and grief at being killers, the bodies change to look like their old friends, the Toa Nuva. While worried that such things could happen again, they decide that the stakes are too high to abandon their quest. However, before the Toa Inika go on they turn to take one last look at the slain Toa Nuva, only to see that the bodies had disappeared. They then realise that the dead Toa Nuva, as well their earlier foes, were merely illusions. In their next test, the Toa Inika are trapped and told they must sacrifice one of their own to continue. With his last death still on his mind, Jaller is distracted long enough for Matoro to volunteer himself, on the grounds that he as a translator has less to offer their mission than the others and becomes another foreshadow to the Barrakki story. This sacrifice is accepted and Matoro is disintegrated - only to be re-formed moments later, as the willingness to die for the cause was what was important, not the death itself. After this, the Toa Inika face Umbra, a guardian of the mask who uses super- speed to attack. Matoro is once again key to passing the test, as he uses his ice power to make Umbra slip and crash. As Umbra turns into a beam of light and becomes even faster, he eventually hits the ice and rebounds around the frozen cave until he is knocked out, making it easy to obtain the mask. As both groups converge on the Mask of Life, the Piraka are a little bit ahead and they set an ambush, with the Toa Inika ending up trapped and delayed. The Piraka enter the mask's chamber to find that Vezon had arrived far ahead of all of them, and has since been fused to a Fenrakk spider and to the Mask of Life itself. As the Piraka prepare to take the mask by any means necessary, Vezon uses his spear to fuse Vezok and Reidak together, ordering the resulting beast to crush the others. By the time the Inika arrive, Vezok and Reidak are back to normal and all six are knocked out. While all this is happening, Brutaka wakes up in the Piraka's stronghold under Axonn's watch. While Axonn extends an offer of friendship to his old partner, Brutaka rejects it and attacks. In the course of the battle, he tries to get an edge by summoning a dimensional gate to warp Axonn away. Eventually, Axonn accepts that Brutaka will never be redeemed, and he becomes unstoppable in his anger. Brutaka tries to get to the Piraka's antidermis, which could enhance his strength, but Axonn shatters the vat before blasting Brutaka into unconsciousness. Once this is done, Botar arrives to banish Brutaka for his crimes, though Axonn still expresses hope for his redemption. After all leave the stronghold, Krahka and Tahtorak use Brutaka's portal to escape their exile (which began a thousand years ago in Bionicle Adventures). As the Toa Inika fight Vezon and Fenrakk, the latter's ability to absorb kinetic energy is proving too much for the heroes; even when the Toa figure out how to weaken the two without hitting them, Fenrakk can just tap his leg on the ground to regain his and Vezon's strength. Eventually, the Toa are able to drive Fenrakk towards the chamber's lava, and Vezon surprisingly encourages him to dive in. As Jaller prepares to go after the mask, Vezon reemerges, with his steed evolved into an even more formidable dragon called Kardas. Needing a plan of attack other than direct assault, the Toa guess that the Mask of Life may have life and thoughts of its own, and Kongu attempts to use his Mask of Telepathy to read the mask's mind. He finds that the mask has grown to despise Vezon, and would happily abandon the madman in favor of a new, nobler guardian - Matoro. When Vezon learns of this he becomes enraged, allowing Jaller to use Axonn's Zamor Sphere. The sphere freezes Vezon and Kardas in space and time, allowing the mask to be removed safely. Unfortunately, the Piraka have recovered by now, and they aren't about to let the mask go without a fight. But the mask has other plans; as Kardas makes Matoro lose his grip on it, it flies away towards the surface. As the Toa Inika are able to get a small head start following it, Vezok is dead set on re-fusing with Vezon; but the other Piraka smash the Spear of Fusion to ensure that Vezok will never be whole again. Back on the surface, the Mask of Life dives into the sea. Hahli tries to follow it, but the depths become too deep for her to handle. As she loses consciousness, a Mahri Nui Matoran dives from below and helps her up to the surface, though at the cost of his own life. Before passing on, he pleads with the Toa to help a city beneath the sea. But in the midst of the Toa Inika's mourning the Matoran, they are reunited with all their friends: the Matoran had succeeded in freeing the Toa Nuva, and Axonn is there as well (Botar had just left after talking to the Nuva). While the Inika worry that the Nuva will take over the mission to save the Great Spirit, the Nuva recognize that this mission is the Inika's destiny and give them their full blessing. Axonn also declares his intent to be the Matoran's guardian; openly instead of secretly this time. The Piraka, watching from afar, decide that taking on twelve Toa and Axonn would be suicide; opting to bide their time. Soon afterward, the Toa depart on their new missions which are revealed on the web: the Toa Nuva go on a mysterious quest that they have not told the Inika about, and the Toa Inika enter a secret passageway (opened by Axonn) leading to the underwater world where the Mask of Life now resides... =Plot Summary (2007)= City of the Lost Far beneath the ocean surrounding Voya Nui, the sunken city of Mahri Nui survives surrounded by mysterious predators. As its Matoran plan the defenses for the month, an inventor named Defilak suggests a scouting expedition to learn more about whatever is preying on Mahri Nui. As he does this, the sentry Kyrehx finds and claims a sinking Kanohi mask, never aware that she is being watched... By the time Kyrehx brings the mask to the planning meeting, it has already been adjourned. She instead seeks out someone knowledgeable about Kanohi, but is soon caught and attacked by the very seaweed beneath her feet. She is saved from the plants by Dekar, and she is happy to pass the strange mask off to him. Meanwhile, Defilak has gathered a crew for his home-built submarine: Gar, Idris, and Sarda. As they descend into unknown territory, they are soon attacked and trapped by a school of Takea sharks, who are led by a bigger, shark-like being who is named Pridak. After the submarine is destroyed, Pridak demands the Mask of Life from the crew and throws Sarda to the sharks when they claim ignorance. He explains that he is a Barraki, one of six warlords banished to the Pit millennia ago for their crimes. Sarda is subsequently saved by the arrival of Toa Lesovikk. The other Barraki, however, have their own plans concerning the mask: Takadox has Carapar kidnap Kyrehx, and from her tale realizes that the mask is the legendary Mask of Life. He also sends Carapar to return Kyrehx and stop Ehlek, who has gathered his venom eel army and launched an all-out assault on Mahri Nui. In the meantime, Dekar has found that every enemy he fights has become immortal and invincible. Realizing that his and Kyrehx's strange curses come from the mask, he decides that it is too dangerous to exist. When Dekar tries to destroy the mask - as the remaining two Barraki, Kalmah and Mantax close in on him - it defends itself by enlarging a nearby venom eel to giant size. The eel begins to attack everything in sight. As Defilak, Gar, and Idris use the chance to escape from Pridak and his sharks; Ehlek and Carapar take the opportunity to snoop around Pridak's lair, where they find a newcomer to the Pit - the mutated Brutaka. Takadox tries to hypnotize the eel into submission, but it becomes distracted by sounds in a long cord of stone that reaches to the surface and it knocks Takadox far away. Dekar, now with a healthy respect for the mask, cautiously touches it and is given a vision of its history, along with the revelation that the Pit's waters are eroding it away and damaging it. By this time, Pridak has gathered the Barraki, with Brutaka in place of the missing Takadox. As they confront Dekar, Brutaka demands he hand over the mask, swearing that an Order of Mata Nui member such as himself would never let the Barraki have it. When Dekar refuses, saying one who should have the mask would have claimed it himself, the Barraki mock Brutaka for his \\"lies\\" about an Order and command a giant squid to drag him off. They then step over to Dekar and take the mask from him, causing it to release a blinding light. Prisoners of the Pit Meanwhile, the Toa Inika are inside the Cord locked in combat with the Zyglak. The light hits them, and they are transformed into the Toa Mahri. At the same time, Dekar is transformed into a duplicate of the former protector of the Pit, Hydraxon. At the same time the Barraki deliver the damaged Kanohi Ignika to Nocturn to keep it safe, the Toa Mahri knock the 300-foot (91 m) venom eel unconscious, and head for Mahri Nui. However, the Matoran there are frightened and uncertain about the new arrivals, and open fire on the Toa. Toa Mahri Kongu then creates a gust of wind to blow Defilak out of the air bubble, while Toa Mahri Hahli creates a whirlpool, trapping the Matoran. Then Hahli releases him, and states that if she wanted to harm him, she would have done so. Still needing to be convinced, Defilak asks five of the Toa Mahri to rescue Matoro. Arriving at the fields, the other Toa Mahri are captured by the Barraki, and attempt to lull them into a false sense of security by masquerading as Toa sent to the Pit for incarceration. Matoro is captured by the newly reincarnated Hydraxon. Hydraxon takes Matoro to the Pit, where he his placed under the watch of the guard robot Maxilos. Matoro's predicament worsens when he learns that Maxilos has become the new body of Teridax, the Makuta of Metru Nui. Teridax frees Matoro, forcing him to ally with him without revealing his identity to the other Toa Mahri. The others, taken to prison caves by the Barraki, escape through the use of their new mask powers; Kongu's summons a giant sea creature, which ends up getting into a battle with the revived 300-foot (91 m) venom eel. All the Toa Mahri then return to Mahri Nui, where the others are introduced to Maxilos. Honored by Defilak by being offered the group name Toa Mahri, the six and Maxilos set out to divide the Barraki against each other. Luckily, their efforts prove successful, and the Barraki and their armies begin clashing. Afterwards, however, the Toa are shocked to learn that Mantax's army of rays is approaching Mahri Nui with Hahli at its head. Meanwhile, Hydraxon had just defeated Nocturn, who had been entrusted with the Ignika by Pridak. He approached the Mask of Life, conflicted as to whether take someplace secure (his first instinct) or destroy it (unconsciously triggered by Dekar's memory). He eventually decided to destroy it and opened fire. Downfall Meanwhile, as Hydraxon tries to destroy the Ignika, the mask is knocked out of the way by Hahli, and Mantax quickly grabs it. After the Toa Mahri reunite with Hahli, they learn from Matoro that they need to destroy the stone cord linking Voya Nui and Mahri Nui and save the Matoran of both islands from the resulting crash. To do so, they travel back up through the cord and hide the Matoran of Voya Nui and Mahri Nui. However, they deal with the Piraka (now mutated into snake-like forms), before being saved by Axonn, who hides the Matoran in caverns on Voya Nui. Before the Toa Mahri leave, Axonn provides them with a living vehicle, the Toa Terrain Crawler, to take them back to Mahri Nui. In time for the battle, Jaller burns Mantax severely, causing him to drop the mask for the Toa to retrieve it when Hydraxon interferes. Hewkii confronts and fights Gadunka, and quickly defeats him by sending volts of electricity into him. Matoro Mahri soon finds Maxilos and freezes him, but is soon set free due to a blast of fire from Jaller that missed Hydraxon. Maxilos and Spinax, now a team, fights Hydraxon, while the Toa get ready to destroy the cord. Before they can, however, Gadunka returns with new allies. The 300-foot (91 m) eel, and the monster Kongu summoned. After a 40-second battle with them, they destroy the cord, bringing Voya Nui crashing down onto Mahri Nui, just as the Barraki come. Matoro feels the mask being pulled in the wake of Voya Nui when suddenly, every creature stops, feeling cold inside. Matoro then looks at the now grey mask, and proclaims that the Great Spirit has died. Knowing that a moment cannot be spared, Matoro leaves his fellow Mahri, and quickly swims with Voya Nui to its place of origin. Meanwhile, the furious Barraki arrive, and have an all-out battle against the five remaining Mahri, and plot to send their armies after Matoro. Meanwhile, Hydraxon, seeing all that has happened, discovers a destroyed Maxilos, with the Spirit of Teridax missing (which will rock the foundation of the Toa's lives once they discover where he is). Matoro beats Voya Nui and descends into the Universe Core, nearly being crushed by the landmass above. There, the sentient Ignika speaks, and informs him to don the Mask of Life, which Matoro accepts as his destiny. The entirety of his life, from Matoran to Toa, flashes, and Matoro realizes that this was where he must be in the end. However, he used his last bit of will to save his friends. His body is then transformed into fierce raw energy, and revives the Great Spirit Mata Nui in a massive explosion. As the battle between the Toa Mahri and the Barraki rages, a sudden change of events occurs; the Mahri are instantly transported back to Metru Nui, able to breathe air, where Turaga Vakama awaits, informing them of Matoro's deed and of his death. But in their hearts, he will never be truly gone, he is now part of the universe, having transcended to a higher state of being. Meanwhile, the Toa Nuva are sent to Artakha, a paradise island, and are given new armor, masks, and weapons. Artakha then teleports the Toa Nuva to Karda Nui, telling them to fulfill their destiny and to wake Mata Nui. =Plot Summary (2008)= Note that the events of Shadows in the Sky, and Swamp of Secrets both take place at the same time, with the exception of the second part of Swamp of Secrets. Shadows in the Sky One week before the ending of Downfall, in Karda Nui, Tanma and Gavla were assigned to adjusting the \\"Scare-Rahi\\" (apparently a scarecrow-like object used for keeping away flying Rahi from the Matoran village) when Tanma noticed a large black flying creature heading for where Gavla was. When he went to help her, he discovered that she was different. She had been hit with a leech-like creature, and mutated into a monstrous form. She had become the first of the Av-Matoran to have her light drained and become a Shadow Matoran. In the following week, Kirop, the leader of the Av-Matoran, became corrupted, along with many others. Even Radiak, hero of the Av-Matoran, succumbed to the attack of the enemies, who Kirop revealed to be members of the Brotherhood of Makuta before his corruption. All of the Av-Matoran villages fell save one, where the remaining uncorrupted Matoran were sheltering at the time of Mata Nui's death. Minutes after the tragic event, Tanma noticed a white Toa falling down the waterfall and there was suddenly a gigantic explosion of light, blinding the three attacking Makuta (Antroz, Vamprah, and Chirox) and bringing the Great Spirit back to life. Likely Tanma ordered all the other Matoran to duck and close their eyes. A few hours later the Av-Matoran waged a battle against the Makuta and the Shadow Matoran in the sky. And as they did so, the Toa Nuva arrived in Karda Nui, teleported there by Artakha from the island with the same name. As soon as the Toa Nuva Arrived, Pohatu rush to engage the Makuta in battle. Wise Onua was the one that noticed that the bat-like Makuta were blind. The Toa helped the Matoran finish the fight and regrouped at the village, where they began to remember that they once lived in Karda Nui. They discovered the use of their new weapons, which they named Midak Skyblasters. (Midak was the name of a strange Onu-Matoran of Metru Nui who liked the light despite being able to see better in the dark, and Toa Nuva Lewa had always wanted a weapon called a \\"Skyblaster\\", and none of the other Toa cared to object, thus the name was created.) Meanwhile, in the Makuta's Shadow Leech hive, Mutran and Vican were working on a new experiment, a Rahi that could turn into a liquid when disturbed. Mutran \\"kept slipping in it\\" and ordered Vican to get rid of it. He kicked it out of the hive and it fell into the swamp below. Vican decided not to tell Mutran that the creature \\"doesn't fall, it flew.\\" Vamprah arrived at the hive and forced Mutran to come to the main Makuta lair to create a flying Rahi to take Vican to Destral to summon Icarax. He created a part-Rahi and part-Matoran creature, and sent Vican off to Destral. Back at the Av-Matoran's village, the Toa Nuva learned of Matoro's death from the Av-Matoran's description of the events leading up to the blinding flash of light. From this they realized that the Mask of Life that Matoro was last seen with was probably in the swamp below. Tahu, Gali, and Onua departed for the swamp and Lewa, Pohatu, and Kopaka stayed to defend the Matoran. Tahu leading one group and Kopaka leading the other. Later, an Av-Matoran who looked up to the Toa, named Solek, approached Kopaka and gave him part of an object called a Keystone. It was a tablet detailing how to awaken Mata Nui from his endless slumber, but it had been broken into six pieces. According to Solek, the Makuta held two pieces (one held by Kirop), and the locations of the other three were unknown. Kopaka, understanding all that these Matoran have been through, spoke kindly to him and gave him inspiration for the battle to come, using how Takua became a Toa as an example. It was then that Kopaka learned that Solek knew Takua. The next day, Lewa happened to knock Kirop out of the sky in battle. Kopaka captured him and with Lewa's help, led him to believe the Toa would be launching an attack on the Shadow Leech hive in a few hours. Kirop found a way out and escaped to the Shadow Leech hive, exactly as the Toa had planned. They followed him, along with Tanma, Solek, and another Av- Matoran named Photok. In the swamp at the bottom of Karda Nui, the Mask of Life pondered whether or not to create some more guardians for it. But recalling the failures of others like Hydraxon and the gigantic Venom Eel, it decided to create a body for itself, so it could have friends like its former guardian, Matoro. It also created itself a Skyboard. It flew into the skies above and began silently following Kopaka and the others as the trailed Kirop. He (now considering itself male) proved itself by saving the Toa from a hostile flying Rahi by speeding up its life, killing it. The Toa did not notice another flying Rahi escape through the Makuta's portal into Karda Nui, with Vican riding it, heading for Destral. When the Toa arrived in the Shadow Leech hive, they found no leeches, and just Mutran instead. Kopaka and Solek hung back to take on Mutran, while the others headed further into the hive, which seemed to be bigger on the inside than it was in the outside. They reached a dead-end, and when they turned around to see if Toa Ignika was still behind them, they found that in his place was a gigantic monster. Without worrying about whether it was hostile or not, Tanma (and the others soon afterwards) jumped into battle. They did not realize that this was an illusion put up by Mutran, and that this monster was actually Toa Ignika. Confused and enraged as to why the Toa were attacking him, he decided to use his Life powers to kill the Toa and their Matoran friends. But eventually the illusion faded and the Toa were able to disrupt Toa Ignika's attack. Meanwhile, Mutran had attempted to tear Kopaka's mind to pieces, and Kopaka led him to believe he had succeeded, until eventually he turned the tides of the battle and froze Mutran in a blast of ice and snow. It was then that Antroz, Chirox, and Vamprah arrived and quickly defeated Kopaka and captured the heroes. The Toa were chained to a wall, and the Matoran were left in another chamber. Antroz warned the Toa that if they made one hostile move, he would send a mental message to Vamprah and Chirox who were with the Matoran to immediately kill them. Pohatu collapsed the floor below the Makuta and used his Mask of Speed to race to the chamber with the Matoran before Vamprah and Chirox killed them. He returned with the Matoran, and the Makuta not far behind. Pohatu shared his mask power with the others and the heroes sped around the chamber too fast to be seen and then escaped. Toa Ignika, using his life power, destroyed the organic stone cord holding the hive up and causing it to fall into the swamp. Vican arrived on Destral before long, and delivered the message to Icarax, who was now wearing Makuta Teridax's Mask of Shadow and sitting on his throne. Though enraged that Antroz was giving him orders, Icarax decided to come and them ordered Vican to tell Antroz that Icarax was not to be ordered around. By the time Icarax had arrived, the final battle had begun. The Makuta laid siege to the Matoran village...only to find that there were no Matoran there. The Toa Nuva and the Matoran were in the Makuta's base, searching for the third keystone. When the Makuta went after them, a battle occurred. In the end, Mutran used the equivalent of a Nova Blast of Shadow. Icarax had earlier sent Antroz into the swamp, and Toa Ignika had made Icarax into a biomechanical being once more by de-evolving him. And after the Nova Blast, Chirox, Vamprah, and Icarax were nowhere to be found. The Toa withstood the blast, and Mutran was forced to surrender. The Toa headed into the swamp to meet up with their friends. But elsewhere, Makuta Teridax's energy floated through an unknown location...a location that would \\"rock the Toa's universe\\" to discover. It was a place heavily guarded, but Teridax easily crossed, having no body and being only a cloud of energy. He located his goal, a carving of a Kanohi Hau, and set about his final goal, to accomplish his destiny. Swamp of Secrets Meanwhile, Takanuva was patrolling the beaches of Metru Nui. He begins wondering if things would have been better for Matoro and Toa Mahri if he had been there. A dark thought flutters in his head for a moment, but he quickly expels it. Pushing forward with his mental energy, Takanuva picks up a picture of a Dark Hunter in the Archives. The Toa of Light races toward the Archives in Onu-Metru, but he is taken by surprise at the sudden attack of a Shadow Leech. After a struggle to get it off, he succeeds, but not before being halfway drained of his light and knocked unconscious. Takanuva wakes up in a room in the Archives where the Onu-Matoran bring dead Rahi bodies for inspection. Illuminating the cave, he notices two Toa standing over him, one Toa of Water, and a Toa of Sonics. The Toa of Water calls herself Helryx, while the Toa of Sonics is Krakua. She explains that they have a message that Takanuva must deliver to the Toa Nuva. Before he leaves, though, Helryx latches her 'pet' Kratana onto Takanuva's Kanohi so he can learn of the past. Meanwhile, the other three Toa Nuva land in the Swamp of Secrets. They decide to split up, and Onua comes across a giant Nui-Kopen. Slamming it with his fist, it falls into the swamp water, and emerges as a completely different looking creature with tentacles. Before it attacks, Onua's body suddenly does not listen to his will, and he witnesses a yellow Makuta approach him. Bitil explains that his Nynrah Ghost Blaster took over Onua's mechanical parts in his body, then summons duplicates of himself, and they take Onua, who is under their control, to Krika's lair for interrogation. In another part of the swamp, Tahu encounters an enormous spherical structure embedded in a fallen stalactite. He approaches it, but is abruptly blown back by an invisible energy field, and a white Makuta looms over him and prepares to feed. In Takanuva's visions of the past, he witnesses the Toa Mata being awoken and spoken to by Helryx. After questions are exchanged and hot arguments are quelled, they are led outside of the room they are in, only to be taught more about what Toa are meant to do in their life. Back in the swamp, Bitil had arrived at Krika's cave. Onua silently realizes that he is no longer under control by Bitil, and quickly gets one duplicate into a headlock. Threatening to tear the Makuta's head off, the other Bitils blast him with energy. Onua rises to see fifty Bitils before him, and he then makes the Earth explode beneath them. His concentration broke, only one Bitil pursues the escaping Onua, who uses his Nynrah Ghost Blaster to create an energy field around Bitil, sending him falling down to the swamp. In yet another part of the swamp, Gali finds a broken Keystone in the grasp of a sentient plant. After successfully retrieving it, she is attacked by Gorast, who stuns her. After a short, furious fight, Gali traps Gorast in a mud sinkhole. Gorast seemingly commits suicide by drowning herself, but she shortly bursts from the ground and defeats Gali. A huge fireball then illuminates the sky. Tahu struggles getting up and then rolls away from Krika's grasp. Krika then explains to Tahu why Makuta hate Toa so much, and that is why he must die. Tahu then succumbs to a sudden cold that sweeps over him, and with one final effort, launches an enormous fireball into the sky. Back in Takanuva's visions, Gali is knocked flat by her trainer, Hydraxon, after being defeated countless times before. She then goes into a short frenzy in a wild effort to defeat him, but fails. She gets up, ready to strike again, but then is knocked down by Spinax. She then finds her way back to the Toa Mata's rest station, and engages in discussion with several of the other Toa. In the present, right before feeding on Gali's light, Gorast is picked up by Onua and slammed into the ground so hard she almost snaps into pieces. Gali turns out to be all right, and Onua and her escape, Gorast and Bitil wildly on their tails. They eventually arrive at the scene of Tahu's dismay, and a short battle ensues. Chirox, another Makuta, is seen falling out of the sky, and the other three rush to help him, leaving the three Toa Nuva alone. They are guided deeper in the swamp by an Av-Matoran who had appeared to help them escape. They eventually arrive at a small ground surrounded by Lightvines. The Nuva are horrified by what they see in the middle: Matoran-like forms are undergoing strange changes. Suddenly, the forms change into Bohrok, leaving the Toa puzzled. The Av-Matoran explains that the first Bohrok had evolved from Av-Matoran, and the transformations came naturally. Gali takes her eyes off of the robots for a moment, and when she looks back, they are gone. The Matoran guide hands Onua a Keystone, and then lies down and transforms into a Bohrok, and disappears like his other brothers. Tahu then expresses his subtle rage toward the fact that that was the price to be paid for Mata Nui's awakening. In Takanuva's visions, he sees Lewa underwater, attempting to find his Miru. Frustrated from the attacks of carnivorous schools of fish, he gives up, and Hydraxon laughs at him. Their trainer had taken each of their masks and hidden it somewhere on Daxia. Angered, Lewa comments on how each of the other Toa Mata are doing, then realizes that they can work together. Hydraxon commends him, and Lewa seeks out Gali's help for getting his mask, in exchange for him getting her mask. After the mask search, Tahu and Kopaka scale a mountain to get to an Order of Mata Nui base. They then trick the guards into letting them in, and they are greeted by Helryx, the leader of the Order. She stops working on her project, the Swamp Strider, and then asks them if they will take on the job to become Mata Nui's guardians. In the present, Tahu and the two other Toa follow a trail created by the Makuta toward Krika's base. They plan a strategy to steal the final Keystone. Once arriving there, they cause timed explosions of their elements to happen. Each explosion goes right, and each Makuta is distracted out of the lair. Seizing the opportunity, the Toa steal the Keystone, and Tahu throws a shield around them from the attack of the non-tricker Krika. Onua digs a huge hole and the Nuva follow it, planning to escape to the Codrex, where they will wait for the other three Toa. Krika and his team follow, planning to ambush the Toa. It turns out the Nuva were the ones planning the ambush. Above the Codrex, they witness the three Makuta and three more Bitils appear, waiting for them. Tahu then lead the two other Nuva in a power dive towards the Makuta in a last attempt to defeat them. In Takanuva's visions, he witnesses the Toa Mata in Karda Nui, and Kopaka and Tahu fighting off a group of Avohkah. After they are defeated, Tahu and Kopaka debate whether or not they should tell the other Mata the truth about the Codrex and what it is meant for. Back in the present, a furious battle breaks out against the two teams in the swamp. Eventually, the Toa gain the upper hand, but not before Antroz and his Makuta team come flying down, and prepare to fire at the Nuva. All hope seems lost, when suddenly, an ice blast blocks the blast of energy Antroz fires, backfiring on him. Kopaka, the three Av-Matoran, and the other two Toa soar down, ready to join the fight. Tahu and his team smile as they charge back into the fight, ready for the final battle. In Takanuva's last vision, Gali defeats the last Avohkah. While Tahu and Kopaka congratulate the team, the final Av-Matoran, Takua, leaves Karda Nui with his friends. While they did that, Tahu and Kopaka led their team to the Codrex. Curious as to what it is, Lewa runs to it, only to be blasted away by the energy field. They insert the Keystone into a niche inside the Codrex's energy field, and enter it. Tahu then closes the entrance, and the Mata witness a huge energy storm brewing inside Karda Nui. Tahu explains what their destinies are, and the other four Toa Mata are outraged by Kopaka and the Toa of Fire for not telling them. Tahu also explains that if they don't get into the six canisters lined up in the Codrex, the storm would kill them all. The team reluctantly enters their canisters, ready for the day that they must awaken. The Kratana is forcefully ripped off of Takanuva's face, and the Toa of Light then asks how he will go to Karda Nui soon enough. At that moment, Brutaka enters the room, holding the Dark Hunter Dweller in his hands. He then activates his damaged Olmak, and Takanuva steps through the portal, ready to begin his trip to Karda Nui. Journey of Takanuva (Note that this story, along with The Kingdom and Dark Mirror, all take place between the ending of Swamp of Secrets, and the beginning of The Final Battle.) After passing through the portal made by Brutaka, Takanuva soon exits through another portal and falls out of the sky, and into a different, pocket dimension, which is the City of Silver Pocket Dimonsion. He had ended up here, because Brutaka's Mask of Dimensional Gates was damaged, thus causing its power to malfunction, which resulted in Takanuva to wind up in the wrong place. When Takanuva lands, he finds himself in a dark forest, and soon comes across the Spectral Mask. At first, Takanuva believes he is hallucinating, as masks normally do not talk. His thoughts, however, do not seem to be acknowledged by the Mask, who talks about its relief of Takanuva's arrival and informs Takanuva of trouble in a nearby village. Without hearing what caused the trouble, Takanuva quickly walks off to help the village. When Takanuva arrives at the village, he sees a large group of Kestora fighting against a large, monster-like creature (City-Building Creature). Thinking that the creature is the source of the commotion (and trouble), Takanuva quickly assaults the creature and drives it off. Turning back to the Kestoras, he expects applause and thanks, but instead, he finds himself being laughed at and locked out of the village. Distressed, Takanuva goes back into the forest and finds the Mask. He informs it of what happened, and the Mask, shocked, tells him that the members of the creature's species are actually the peaceful inhabitants of the village, and they had been driven out of their city by the Kestoras. It also informs Takanuva that the one he fought off was the last one residing in the village. Takanuva, quickly noting his mistake, runs off to find the creature and apologize. He succeeds, and together they hatch a plan to steal back the city. At night, Takanuva stations himself outside the village and shoots fireworks into the sky. The Kestoras quickly swarm out of the village, and watch the fireworks in fascination. While they watch and enjoy themselves, the creature burrows back to the city and seals the gates, locking the Kestoras out and reclaiming the village. Having finally accomplished his task, Takanuva goes back to the Mask, who congratulates him and opens a portal. Takanuva enters it, and is transported once more into another dimensional voyage in The Kingdom Alternate Universe, which is told in The Kingdom short story. The events of the final journey of Takanuva, including how he got to Karda Nui, are told in the Dark Mirror short story. The Final Battle The fight between the Toa Nuva and the blind and mutated Makuta rages on in the swamp. Krika deals a heavy blow that stuns Gali, and he carries her deeper into the swamp. While there, Krika claims that if the Toa awaken Mata Nui, a horrible future will come to pass, so Gali must leave to prevent that. No sooner than when those words left the Makuta's mouth, a powerful blast of light flew across Krika's face. He looked skyward to find the worst fear of the Brotherhood of Makuta: Takanuva, the legendary Toa of Light, with his power lance still aimed at the Makuta, ready to destroy his armor. Krika retreated into the swamp. Gali, confused at the Toa's transformation, wanted answers, only to be told to wait until the Toa were assembled. Pohatu arrived shortly after and remarked on Takanuva's new coloration. When the trio arrived at the Codrex, there was a great battle between the Toa and Makuta. Fortunately, Takanuva arrived from the Space Between Dimensions, using the deceased Dark Mirrors Demension's Brutaka's Mask of Dimensional Gates, and manages to drive off the Makuta Krika, who was menacing Gali, with his Power Lance. A soon as the Toa were reassembled, Ignika (now able to speak) arrived. Ignika quickly reported that he was on a countdown to the elimination of everything in the Universe. He told of how he was forged, and that the Great Beings intended him as a failsafe if the universe ever went wrong. Takanuva then reported that when the Toa reawaken Mata Nui, a massive energy storm will erupt in Karda Nui, and destroy everyone and everything in the cavern. No sooner than when he finished the report, the Makuta returned, and a massive battle erupted once more. The Toa rushed to fit the keystones they retrieved into the Codrex. With the energy field down, they entered the complex, unaware that Antroz was silently following them. Before the other Makuta could get in, Tahu retrieved the keystones to raise the energy field once more. Inside the Codrex, the Toa Nuva discovered niches in the floor, similar in size and shape to the canisters that they used to make their way to the island of Mata Nui. Onua hit a button on a nearby console, and the floor slid down to a cavern far below. The niches were then replaced by large light stones, and three metal cocoons erupted from the floor. The cocoons then disappeared, leaving behind three vehicles. Then Antroz sprang from the shadows into the cockpit of one of the ships, the Jetrax T6. His mind merged with the ship, allowing him to see through the ship's sensors. Lewa and Pohatu both jumped aboard the Axalara T9 and Rockoh T3, and pursued Antroz out of the Codrex. Outside the Codrex, Takanuva meets up with Tanma and Photok, and they dragged Radiak into the swamp, unaware that they are being followed by Kirop, Chirox, and Bitil (with his past selves). Vamprah, Gavla and Gorast had gone to track down Icarax, as had Tahu, Solek and Ignika, and Krika and Mutran had vanished. Mutran's assistant, the Shadow Matoran Vican, meets Takanuva, Photok, Radiak and Tanma. He reports that the scream of a klakk shattered the hold shadow had over him, and he no longer served the Makuta. Takanuva, seeing the truth in his eyes, began search for the klakk. Ironically, Radiak was the one to find the creature. He attacked the rahi, intent on destroying it, but the ceature's cry broke the shadow spell. Although Radiak's mental state was restored, his armor, mask, and elemental ability remained as when he was fully in shadow. Radiak then reported the Makuta actually wanted Mata Nui to awaken for reasons he did not know. Takanuva ordered the four Matoran to leave Karda Nui before the energy storm erupted, but as they left, Takanuva was attacked by Chirox, Kirop, and seven incarnations of Bitil. Under the sway of shadow, he lost control to rage and started attacking them all, taunting them that their greatest wish, a Toa of Shadow, was now in existence and they could choke on the knowledge he was not theirs, and declaring that this battle would not be a Kolhii masquerade; that any Makuta that got near him would die. He blasted a hole in Chirox's armor and charged into the midst of the Makuta, never noticing one of the Bitils was about to strike him down. Meanwhile, Antroz fought Pohatu, Lewa and Kopaka in a battle on board vehicles. Meanwhile, Takanuva was locked in combat with Chirox and Bitil. A bolt of light fired by Kopaka aboard the Jetrax stunned Bitil, causing him to lose focus on his mask and the time clones created by his mask to disappear. Before Takanuva could destroy Chirox though, Kopaka brought him to his senses, allowing the Makuta to flee. Takanuva reported to Kopaka what he had learned from Radiak, and Kopaka left aboard the Jetrax to warn the other Toa Nuva. Takanuva resumed his search for Matoran and came across Gavla. He managed to put himself and the Matoran in the path of the Klakk's scream, and the mental shadow dissolved in both of them. Takanuva told Gavla to leave, for her to join the other Matoran. Icarax and Krika try to sabotage the plan, by destroying the Codrex. Because of this, Gorast and Vamprah convinced Icarax to teleport, by telling him the plan is working. Fueled by his desires for the plan to fail so he can take over the world, he falls for the trick. Then Gorast disrupts his teleportation power making parts of him scatter all over the universe. Krika escapes for now. The Toa Nuva reveal that the Lightstones that come up from the canisters resting spot are the key to awaking Mata Nui, They figure out that Ignika could awaken the Great Spirit by removing his mask and placing it in the center of the Codrex. However, in doing so Ignika would have to sacrifice his life as a Toa, something he has vowed never to do, and he tries to destroy them when he hears the news. However, when Matoro and how he gave his life to save the entire universe is mentioned, Ignika finally decides to sacrifice himself. Outside the Codrex, Tahu and Gorast are fighting. Krika comes to warn Gorast that an energy storm will kill them all, but she is so bent on killing him for trying to ruin the plan, she doesn't listen. She disrupts his power to turn intangible, and he becomes nothing. Just then, the energy storm began. As Takanuva flew to the western portal, he noticed Mutran attempting to control the storm. His life was ended as the energy incinerated his armor and his essence. Takanuva, without regret for not trying to save the Makuta, flew away to join the Toa Nuva. Meanwhile, Gorast could only stare at the storm, shocked by the betrayal of her idol. Antroz tries to convince all the Makuta that they must try to escape, but Bitil tries to abandon his fellow Makuta. He fails, and all of the remaining Makuta are killed. The Toa Nuva and Takanuva use the vehicles to escape Karda Nui. Back in Metru Nui, celebrations have begun. But just as Turaga Dume finished his victory speech, a shadow fell across the land, and the stars align into the Kanohi Kraahkan, Great Mask of Shadows. Teridax announces that when Mata Nui awakened, Teridax slipped into the Great Spirit's mind, possessing his body and banishing Mata Nui's mind into the Mask of Life (the only thing to escape the storm, teleported away to safety). Teridax tells the Toa that he has also banished the mask from the universe. He now is the Matoran universe, and the Toa have no hope of defeating him. The book ends with the Mask of Life turning back to gold, and hurdling through the Bionicle Galaxy, the space between the \\"universes.\\" Within the mask, the voice of the Great Spirit vows, \\"I will return,\\" as the Mask of Life reaches a mysterious planet. Super Chapter Books =Raid on Vulcanus (2009)= The book begins with Fero and Skirmix searching for prey out in the desert. Fero is about to leave when Skirmix indicates there is prey around. Fero spots a caravan, protected by Gelu, heading toward Tajun, and decides to pursue. Gelu reflects how the Skrall have slowly become more and more aggressive, finally attacking Atero. Gelu's Sand Stalker rears at the sight of a destroyed caravan, the site of a Bone Hunter raid. Gelu tells the Agori he is escorting that it is nothing to worry about. He then spots a Bone Hunter riding towards him and orders the Agori to flee and hide in a sandstorm. Gelu rides up to meet Fero, and the two engage in battle. The Ice Tribe Glatorian is able to knock Fero off of his steed, but the Bone Hunter quickly recovers and aims his Thornax Launcher at Gelu, ordering him to get off his Sand Stalker and toss his Thornax Launcher away. The Glatorian does so, and, after a brief sword fight, Gelu gains the upper hand and defeats Fero, discovering a map of modern Vulcanus in the Bone Hunter's possession. Gelu asks what it is, but Fero refuses to talk, even when the Glatorian threatens to kill Skirmix. Gelu leaves and catches up with the caravan, which had been raided by Zesk. Once the group resumes its journey, Gelu studies the map and realizes that it details the defenses of Vulcanus, even ones that were not there even a week ago, and that the map is not written in the Bone Hunter's language, but instead Agori. When Gelu and the Agori reach Tajun, the Glatorian meets up with Metus, who talks about Tajun and its Glatorian, and asks Gelu if he would be interested in fighting for the village. When Gelu declines, Metus says that he is on his way to Vulcanus with Gresh to fight against Ackar, and Gelu decides to travel to Vulcanus with them. Along the way, the group runs into a caravan with a broken wheel. The Agori in the caravan are somewhat biased against Gelu, as a Glatorian of the Ice Tribe offered to help them earlier in exchange for half of their goods, due to the path ahead being filled with Vorox. Gresh offers to repair their wheel and escort them for free, much to objections of Metus. After the caravan is fixed, Gresh says that they should keep traveling despite it being nighttime, reasoning that they have a better chance of surviving a Vorox attack if they are moving rather than if they make camp. As they travel through the desert, they notice a Vorox about to attack them, and Gelu defeats it with a Thornax. A multitude of Vorox then begin to attack the two Glatorian, who are able to fend most of them off. When the Vorox become too much to handle, Gelu and Gresh decide to toss two pieces of new armor from the caravan in opposite directions, resulting in the Vorox fighting each other for the cargo, and the group is able to make it out of the pass safely. As they near Vulcanus, Gelu compliments Gresh on his fighting. After they reach their destination, the Agori apologize for judging the Glatorian so harshly, but Metus sends Gresh and Gelu off, stating that they are supposed to accept pay for helping. The two Glatorian eventually make it to the village inn of Vulcanus, where they talk about being a Glatorian and about the Core War. Gelu then spots Raanu, and excuses himself. The Ice Glatorian tells Raanu about the map, and they discuss the chances of survival against a Bone Hunter attack. Raanu suggests fleeing, but Gelu instead suggests assembling a group of Glatorian to defend the village. Raanu asks Gelu if he is going to lead the Glatorian, but Ackar, having overheard the conversation, says he will do it instead. The Fire Glatorian looks over the map and questions Gelu's idea, saying that Bone Hunters can cause great destruction. When Raanu asks if Ackar is saying they should flee, the Glatorian responds by saying that Gelu's plan is most likely the best choice. Gresh declares that he supports it, and Ackar orders him to go to Tesara and recruit some Glatorian. He also sends out two Glatorian trainees to Tajun to seek help there, and Gelu stays with Ackar. Ackar instructs Raanu what to do if the Bone Hunters attack the village while the Glatorian are gone, then leaves with Gelu. The two Glatorian ride into the north, where Ackar explains he has to pick up a \\"friend\\" to aid in an attack on the Bone Hunter camp. Meanwhile, Gresh rides to Tesara, and on his way, he ponders the Skrall and Bone Hunters, and what they could do if they allied with each other. Elsewhere, Fero and four other Bone Hunters hear the two rookie Glatorian from Vulcanus. Fero orders the group to split up into two groups, planning to ambush and kill the Glatorian. Ackar and Gelu cut to the west across the bed of the Skrall River, where Gelu notices telltale marks of Vorox in the sand. Ackar tells Gelu that they are heading for a cave inside a small mountain range when they are suddenly ambushed by Zesk and Vorox. Gelu reaches for his Thornax Launcher, but the Fire Glatorian stops him. Ackar calls for Malum, who is hiding in the cave. At hearing this, the Vorox begin murmuring among themselves. Ackar calls again, and Malum comes out of his cave. He asks the two Glatorian why they have come, and Ackar tells Malum that Vulcanus is in trouble. Malum refuses to help until Ackar reveals that the Bone Hunters are involved. Ackar then explains the situation, and Malum agrees to help. In Tesara, Gresh goes to the arena, where Vastus is in a practice session. Vastus asks if Gresh's match was canceled, and Gresh tells Vastus the situation. Vastus refuses to help, saying that it could be a trick by the Bone Hunters, and states that he will not leave Tesara. Angered, Gresh leaves. Elsewhere, Kiina and Tarix scan the Wastelands to investigate rumors of a herd of wild Rock Steeds. They instead find the bodies of the two rookie Glatorian sent from Vulcanus and a Bone Hunter sword buried in the sand nearby. Kiina offers to go to Vulcanus to tell them about the deaths of the Glatorian trainees, and Tarix says he will bury the two at Tajun. Meanwhile, Ackar, Gelu, and Malum go to the Bone Hunter camp, and at Malum's order, the Vorox attack and ambush the Bone Hunters. At first, the Vorox and Glatorian are able to defeat many Bone Hunters, but in the middle of the battle, one of them throws something on the fire and causes it to explode into a much larger blaze. The Bone Hunters gain the upper hand and manage to take down many Vorox, and the remaining Vorox, along with the Glatorian, retreat. They return to the cave, and Ackar asks if Malum could defend Vulcanus. He refuses, but wishes the two luck in the battle to come. In Vulcanus, Raanu watches the Agori villagers work on the village defenses when Kiina arrives, telling Raanu about the deaths of the Glatorian trainees. Raanu then explains the situation to Kiina, and she tells Raanu to flee. Raanu objects to this, and the two argue. As they argue, they are interrupted by Gelu and Ackar. Gelu tells Raanu about the attack on the Bone Hunter camp while Ackar greets Kiina. Kiina asks Ackar why he is encouraging the village to fight the Bone Hunters, and Ackar responds by asking what the village would do when the Skrall come. Gelu then suggests adding on to the village's defenses. Hours pass as the villagers add on to the defenses of the village, and eventually Kiina joins in. A few Glatorian, including Gresh, Strakk, and a few apprentices from Tesara arrive at Vulcanus. Gelu asks how Gresh got Strakk to join, and Gresh tells Gelu that he lied, and told Strakk that there was a large Exsidian payment. Gresh then explains to the other Glatorian that he met up with an Agori on the way back to Vulcanus, and the Agori told him that the Skrall informed him that the Bone Hunters would be attacking from the east, from the treacherous Iron Canyon. Raanu tells Ackar that they must build walls along the canyon rim, but Ackar refuses, and Kiina agrees, saying that they should trick the Hunters. Meanwhile, Fero and his comrades ride through the Wastelands to Vulcanus. One young Bone Hunter objects to the raid, and in response, Fero kills him. He asks if any other Bone Hunters have anything to say, and when no one answers, unwilling to be killed, the Hunters ride on. Elsewhere, in Roxtus, Tuma thinks about the past few weeks, such as an Agori betraying his kind, and supplying information to the Skrall. Stronius then comes in and asks why Tuma supplied information to Vulcanus. Tuma tells Stronius that it is a \\"test\\" for the Bone Hunters, and he wished to make the \\"test\\" harder for them. At Vulcanus, Kiina teaches an Agori how to use a Thornax Launcher with a rock in place of the Thornax, with no success. Kiina tells the Agori to go to Gresh, who is teaching the Agori how to cut Fireroot vines for a trap. Metus, one of Gresh's Agori, tries to cut it, but gets his knife stuck in the vine. Raanu cuts the vine easily, and Metus says he would rather go to Gelu or Strakk, when he realizes Strakk is gone. Later Gelu makes a trap to be used on the Bone Hunters. When the alert is set off that the Bone Hunters have arrived, Gelu sets off the trap, killing and wounding several Bone Hunters. After losing some of his group, Fero decides to turn back and return to the desert. Upon hearing of the Bone Hunters retreat, Raanu dismisses the Glatorian, despite Kiina's warnings. Kyry spots something in the desert, and upon realizing that it's Bone Hunters, attempts to warn Raanu, but is knocked unconscious. The Bone Hunters attack Vulcanus, and despite the assistance of Ackar, is badly outmatched. The other Glatorian return, this time with Tarix, Vastus, and several trainees. The Glatorian are able to defend the village from the Bone Hunters, and drive Fero, the last remaining Hunter, away. =The Legend Reborn (2009)= The book begins with the Kanohi Ignika flying through space, launched from the moon Aqua Magna, containing the mind and spirit of Mata Nui, after his gigantic robot body was stolen by Teridax, right after the events of Bionicle Legends #11: The Final Battle. The former Great Spirit vows to save his people, even as the mask is caught by the nearby Bara Magna's gravity. The Ignika lands in the desert, creating a large crater, which attracts the attention of several Scarabax Beetles, including Click. It then rises in the air and uses its power to create a body for its host, which scares most of the beetles away, except for Click. Mata Nui quickly befriends a remaining Scarabax Beetle (Click, who was not yet named), which touches the Mask of Life, and is transformed into a shield. Mata Nui immediately puts it to use defending himself, as a Vorox attacks him, which retreats after its tail breaks, from the impact of striking Mata Nui's shield very hard. The shield transforms back into a beetle, and Mata Nui picks up the tail, as a Thornatus reaches the scene, driven by Metus. The Agori agrees to take Mata Nui to Vulcanus, where he has some business. The two arrive in time to watch an Arena Match between Ackar and Strakk. The veteran overcomes the ice tribe warrior, but after surrendering Strakk attacks Ackar from behind by throwing his shield towards Ackar. Mata Nui saves the Vulcanus Glatorian, managing to defeat Strakk, when the Vorox stinger tail he carries transforms into a sword, after touching the mask. Ackar takes Mata Nui to his hut. Metus arrives and offers Mata Nui the chance to become a Glatorian, but Mata Nui refuses. While he is speaking with Ackar about his mission, Kiina jumps out of hiding. After noticing Mata Nui's Scarabax and calling it Click jokingly, Mata Nui accepts the name. She, having heard him speak of his mission, offers to show Mata Nui a cavern full of ancient technology in Tajun he can use, in exchange for him taking her along on his journey. On the next day, the three leave for Tajun on Kiina's Thornatus. While traveling through Sandray Canyon, they discuss the possibility of there being a traitor among the Agori. However, the Skopio XV-1 vehicle, piloted by Telluris (a feared and vicious Glatorian, who works with the Skrall) suddenly emerges from the ground in front of them, and Bone Hunters, sent after the group by the Agori traitor, appear behind them. At first put at a disadvantage, they manage to escape when Mata Nui creates an avalanche, which buries Telluris's Skopio XV-1 and all of the bandits, killing the pack of Bone Hunters. With Telluris knocked unconscious, they confiscate his vehicle, and imprison him. Upon reaching Tajun, the Mata Nui and Glatorian find it burning, and destroyed. Inside the destroyed village, the group finds Gresh, badly wounded. They head for Kiina's cave, and while doing so, they see Tuma leading Skrall and Bone Hunters and realize they have joined forces. In Kiina's cave, they find Berix, with whom Kiina becomes annoyed for trespassing, being possessive of the cavern. Mata Nui and Ackar manage, though, to convince her to let him treat Gresh, despite her heavily negative opinion about the particular Agori. Meanwhile, Mata Nui is attracted by the inscriptions and symbols on the cavern wall, finding them familiar. Kiina negatively theorizes that it must have been built by the Great Beings, startling Mata Nui. He finds a great door marked with a familiar symbol. The Ignika opens it and inside Mata Nui finds the designs of his old robot body. In Roxtus, Tuma gloats over his success in destroying Bara Magna's main water source, which he believes will make the other villages fight against each other for the precious substance. Meanwhile, back in Tajun, Ackar knocks out a pair of Bone Hunter guards, clearing the way for the others to come out. Seeing their weapons' sorry state, Ackar requests Mata Nui to use the Ignika's power to repair them. Mata Nui does so with Ackar's sword, granting him Fire abilities. Taking Kiina's staff next, Mata Nui states he will then resume his own quest, but is persuaded by his newfound friends to remain. He then transforms Gresh's blades next. The group then travels to Tesara, and along the way, the Glatorian practice with their new elemental powers and Ackar starts teaching Mata Nui fighting techniques. Arriving in Tesara, they find a match between Vastus and Tarix taking place, with Metus and Raanu overseeing it. Ackar speaks to the crowd against the Glatorian system and is supported by Vastus and Tarix. The Skrall-Bone Hunter alliance and the destruction of Tajun is announced and Ackar calls for unity. Raanu states they cannot fight the Skrall, but at Ackar's request, Mata Nui demonstrates the mask's ability to transform Glatorian weapons, and made an example with Tarix's Water Blades. Raanu gets Mata Nui and the Glatorian to swear allegiance to the Agori and they all celebrate their new unity. Defenses are immediately built in Tesara. Meanwhile, Kiina corners Berix in the Hot Springs and accuses him of being the traitor, but the two are then captured by the real traitor along with some Skrall and Bone Hunters. Metus and Raanu run to the village to announce their capture and Mata Nui resolves to go rescue them, alone. Before leaving, he assists in the uniting of the two metal shelters of the village, and realizes something, though he does not share his realization with Ackar. Caged in Roxtus, Kiina and Berix are clashing over the cavern. Eventually, the two realize they were both seeking to hide from the outside world in there and agree to share the place. Meanwhile, Mata Nui reaches Roxtus, and challenges Tuma in a duel for his friends' freedom. They both battle fiercely, but Tuma gains the upperhand. Suddenly Mata Nui remembers Ackar's training and finds a wound in Tuma's back, which had been caused by a Baterra a few weeks earlier. Using it against him, he slips under the Skrall leader's guard, and strikes 3 times, which causes Tuma to faint, who was unable to bare the pain of his reopened wound. Mata Nui waits for the Skrall to honor his deal with Tuma. But then Metus appears, revealing himself to be the traitor, and orders the Skrall and the Bone Hunters to kill Mata Nui. The former Great Spirit makes Click escape, but the Scarabax returns along with hundreds of its kin, which gather in a huge form resembling Malum, which temporarily scares the Skrall and Bone Hunters. Mata Nui frees Kiina and Berix, even as the Glatorian and Agori arrive to fight the Skrall and the Bone Hunters, and Click rejoins Mata Nui. Tuma, even though he is imprisoned, manages to escape into the desert, along with Telluris, who has regained possession of the ruined Skopio XV-1. As Tuma escapes, his bodyguard, Stronius temporarily takes control of the united Skrall army, in Tuma's absence. A great battle ensues, but despite the initial surprise, the enemies regroup and start defeating the Glatorian. After fighting Mata Nui briefly, Fero, the Bone Hunter leader, leaves the battle, expecting the Skrall to lose. Mata Nui manages to open a gap in their lines and spots Metus fleeing. He pursues, defeating the Agori's guards, and reaches Metus's Thornatus which is then flipped over by some Vorox. Mata Nui transforms the traitor into a snake through usage of the Ignika and returns to his friends. Meanwhile, Ackar, Gresh and Kiina, cornered by the Skrall, attempt to combine their powers but are unable to repel the assault. Mata Nui adds Life energy to their attack, increasing the intensity sufficiently to drive the Skrall, and the Bone Hunters back, leaving the Glatorian victorious, even as their enemies scattered and retreated into the wilderness. Weeks later, Mata Nui witnesses the uniting of the metallic shelters of the villages to protect the new mega-city. As the process is completed, Mata Nui's, and his friends recognize the structure's resemblance to the shape of the mechanical being (Mata Nui's original body), seen in the cavern. Berix shows Mata Nui a coin he found in the cavern, with the shape of the robot on one side, and the pattern of a Skrall shield on the other. Mata Nui resolves to discover its meaning, which is a map of the Valley of the Maze. Mata Nui, accompanied by Kiina, Gresh, Ackar and Berix, serving as Chronicler, leaves on a journey north of the Black Spike Mountains, to head to the Valley of the Maze, in hopes of finding a way to regain his original body from Teridax. They will challenge many enemies, including the shapeshifting Baterra, who plagued, and nearly wiped out the Skrall. They will also have to deal with and surviving Skrall, Bone Hunters, and other threats. But, despite knowing he will soon have to fight alone, once he meets Teridax again, Mata Nui realizes his friends have taught him more than he ever learned by himself, in his long existence. =Journey's End (2010)= Prologue Angonce stands in his chamber, reflecting lamentingly on the beauty of Spherus Magna and its past. He dwells on the Great Beings' ability to create and study, but not to lead and govern, and then the Element Lords and their failure in leading the Agori. The Great Being then walks out of his room and leaves the fortress, glancing up at the giant robot before him, the last hope for Spherus Magna. He decides to name the robot \\"Mata Nui,\\" which is the word for \\"Great Spirit\\" in the Matoran Language. Chapter 1 With information from the Agori Berix and Crotesius, Mata Nui has found the center of the vast Valley of the Maze, but cannot locate an entrance to the chamber within. Upon voicing his frustrations aloud, a recording asks him three questions which he realizes are a riddle. After hours of reflection, Mata Nui comes to realize that the solution to the riddle is the Three Virtues that the Great Beings had instilled in him, for they too had made the chamber. An opening is created, and Mata Nui enters down a stairway to a wide pool of lava. Immediately, he notices the Agori Tarduk suspended above the lava. At the Mega-Village, Kiina and Ackar express worry about Mata Nui's long absence and finally agree to go search for their friend. Chapter 2 Mata Nui rescues Tarduk, but even as he does the tower begins to crumble and fall apart. Mata Nui and Tarduk flee, and once out of the building, turn to see a volcano emerging from the ground under it. Mata Nui realizes it is not a natural volcano and, by digging through the rock, finds a metal hatch and enters it, finding himself inside a mechanism created by the Great Beings. He climbs through it, eventually reaching an open space where he finds the designs of his original body, along with a screen which recounts the tale of his origin and makes him remember his original mission: to pull together the fragments of Spherus Magna. He also finds out the Great Beings had planned to build a second robot, to help him with the task, but were unable to do so. Mata Nui begins to despair, but Tarduk arrives and, learning of this, helps him realize that he can use the broken robot to achieve the same result, and the two agree to search for a second power source that the Great Beings likely built for their planned robot. Chapter 3 Now returned to the Agori village, Mata Nui asks Raanu if he can occupy the robot, which Raanu flatly refuses. Ackar, in light of Mata Nui's role against the Skrall, persuades him to listen, and shows Raanu the real shape of the village. However, Raanu continues to refuse due to concern for the safety of the Agori, despite Mata Nui's pleas. Later, Mata Nui talks with Ackar and Gresh, explaining Makuta Teridax's ambition of conquest and power, which Mata Nui once wielded. While Ackar trusts Mata Nui completely, Gresh is shocked about Mata Nui's true nature and fears he may use the power of his old body to rule them. Mata Nui counters Gresh calmly, stating that, if Gresh does believe he is a threat, he is more than welcome to imprison him, which Gresh cannot bring himself to do. Meanwhile, Raanu reflects upon his past, the time when during the Core War he served the Great Beings and witnessed the construction of Mata Nui's original body. Finally, pondering over recent events and the decision at hand, he decides to seek out Mata Nui and discuss it with him. After the Agori leader questions Mata Nui's need, the former Great Spirit senses the Makuta's approach in order to kill him and informs Raanu of this, and that the only way he can stop him is to fight him. Faced with what Mata Nui has said, Raanu finally agrees, but warns Mata Nui against betraying them. Chapter 4 Teridax flies through space, reflecting on the Makuta's desire for the respect of the Matoran, his struggle to take over the Matoran Universe, and his discovery of Mata Nui's survival. He accelerates toward Bara Magna, eager to eliminate Mata Nui and use Bara Magna as a base for his universal conquest. Meanwhile, inside the Matoran Universe, Tahu, regarding their situation with annoyance, has just tried to ambush a group of Rahkshi with Onua, but the Rahkshi reversed their direction before the trap could be sprung. A flying member of the Order of Mata Nui arrives and announces the Rahkshi have gathered south. Tahu orders her to find as many Toa as she can to pursue the Rahkshi. Meanwhile, Nektann, on Zakaz, remembers the Skakdi history and how he allied with Teridax as they prepare to travel south. Chapter 5 Mata Nui stands in the head of the Prototype Robot with a box containing the Power Source required to energize the robot. Kiina questions him about his decision to use the robot and the impact it would have. Mata Nui reassures her and hands Click to her for safety, appreciating the friendship given to him by Kiina and the other Glatorian, to her emotional response. At his request, Kiina leaves to join the others in the desert. Inside the robot, Mata Nui powers it up, fearing an explosion similar to the one that scattered it 150,000 years ago. None occurring, he removes the Ignika, allowing his body to disintegrate and beginning to focus on shifting his mind into the robot's body, successfully entering it after some struggle. In the desert, the Glatorian and Agori witness in awe and disbelief the robot being powered up and animated as Mata Nui rises in his new body. Ackar draws his attention using his Fire powers, speaking with Mata Nui who sends them to take shelter while he begins his attempt to repair the Shattering, watching them go and requesting the Vorox, Bone Hunters and Skrall to take cover likewise, to the acquiescence of the first and suspicion of the other two. Mata Nui then releases gravitic energy aimed at Bota Magna and Aqua Magna. However, just as the beams of energy strike the targets, Teridax arrives, eclipsing the sun and striking Bara Magna, creating a gigantic crater and earthquakes. Chapter 6 As Kiina and Gresh look at the two robots confronting each other, Gresh suggests going out to help Mata Nui, but Kiina tells him to make a plan first. Meanwhile, Mata Nui attempts to convince Teridax not to fight, but Makuta instead tries to persuade the Great Spirit to join him. Mata Nui reveals their destiny to remake Spherus Magna, but his opponent does not accept it. He asks Mata Nui the reason for his fighting and is surprised by his new concern for the inhabitants of Bara Magna. Lifting the mountain under which the Agori and Glatorian are sheltering themselves, he threatens to drop it on them, but Mata Nui retaliates, blasting Makuta with energy. Inside the robot, Tahu and Takanuva witness the quake resulting from Mata Nui's blow and Tahu melts metal falling toward them. The Rahkshi they are following are scattered too, but quickly reassemble and continue their journey south. The Toa keep pursuing them. On Bara Magna, Mata Nui incinerates the mountain Makuta was holding, saving the Agori. He orders everyone to escape, and Ackar convinces Raanu to do so, while he and the Glatorian try to help Mata Nui. Makuta reminds Mata Nui he can make him exhaust his power to help his friends and that inside him live the Matoran, but Mata Nui resolves to keep fighting, only to discover Bara Magna's moons are drifting away from the planet and his own power supply is an hour away from depletion. Chapter 7 In order to assist Mata Nui, the Glatorian attack weak points of the robot under Teridax's control to distract him, while Gresh attempts to penetrate the robot, planning to then destroy everything in sight to disable the Makuta. However, the Thornax used by the Glatorian do not have any visible effect, and are apparently unnoticed by Teridax, though Gresh manages to reach a hatch at the foot of the robot. Unknown to the Glatorian, Teridax has noticed them and, having expected their resistance, carries out his prepared plan of using an assembled army of Rahkshi and Skakdi to combat them. Gresh who is at the entrance of the robot, sees it opening and hides, witnessing the arrival of the army which attacks the Glatorian. Kiina attempts to fight a Rahkshi of Heat Vision which fends off her assault and strikes her, knocking her down and robbing her of her weapon, before preparing to deal the final blow. Ackar beheads the Rahkshi and helps Kiina up, when both notice the Rahkshi's Kraata which Ackar reduces to ashes, then continuing to combat the Skakdi and Rahkshi. Gresh, indecisive about whether to help his friends or invade the robot, approaches the hatch as Tahu and Takanuva exit ahead of a massive group of Toa. Believing them to be enemies, he strikes, only to be blinded by Takanuva's counterattack. The two Toa prepare to dispatch him when he realizes from their speech that they are allies and informs them of this. Tahu, conversing with Gresh, briefly explains the danger of the Rahkshi whom his friends are combating, then orders the Toa army to move out. Gresh states his plan but is dissuaded by Takanuva. The Glatorian then rushes off to fight and Takanuva begins to follow when he notices that Tahu has frozen as if in a trance, not responding to the Toa of Light. Watching the battle from atop a hill, Stronius briefly reflects over the Skrall attempt at conquest, wishing for vengeance on the Glatorian who foiled their plan (Mata Nui). He orders the few Skrall he has gathered to attack the Glatorian who have been injured. Chapter 8 Tahu stands where he perceives is Ta-Wahi, believing he is under an illusion by Teridax. The Ignika appears to him and explains that the Glatorian and Agori will not survive the battle without help. The mask then proceeds to devolve him back into a Toa Mata. As Tahu expresses his anger, the Ignika reveals the details of the Golden Armor, which can be used to help stop Teridax. It begins to create the armor for him before warning that it can only be used once, and that its use could harm him. Tahu awakens and notices the pieces of the armor appearing on the sand. He and Takanuva are able to retrieve two of the pieces, but Teridax then disperses a blast of energy, scattering the other pieces across the desert. As the Toa of Fire and Light recover, a Rahkshi snatches one of the pieces. Meanwhile, Gresh defeats several Rahkshi. Before he could go to aid Ackar, a piece of the Golden armor lands near him. He picks it up, and decides to examine it later, since a Skakdi is coming to assault him. Elsewhere on the battlefield, Nektann continues in the brawl against the Glatorians, thinking to himself just how easy it was for him to defeat them. Taking notice of an embattled Rahkshi nearby, he hesitates to assist it; but he eventually decides to aid it, due to his alliance with Teridax. The warlord then pushes aside an Agori who tried to stop him, before stumbling over a piece of the golden armor. He grabs it, believing it to be something of value, as be thinks that with the battle seeming too short, he might just get some loot to make the battle worth it. Meanwhile, both Mata Nui and Teridax were fighting each other on an almost even level. Mata Nui had been able to do some more damage to Teridax, but Teridax has more energy reserves, and greater strength. Teridax currently has the advantage over Mata Nui, who barely manages to hold his own. Mata Nui fires an energy blast at Teridax in retaliation to one of Teridax's comments, fusing some circuits together again within him, and causing some minor damage. In response, Teridax angrily prepares to crush the planet with gravitational power, which would cause the world to fold upon itself, and would result in the death of everybody on the planet, except for Teridax, and Mata Nui. Chapter 9 During the minutes before Teridax's blast, Gresh spots Skrall warriors joining the fight and turns to attack them. Spotting a piece of Golden Armor in one's hand and believing it to be a weapon, he attacks the Skrall with his air power, and manages to get the piece to fly to him, even as three Skrall successfully battle their way through the windstorm, to attack him. Meanwhile, Takanuva is fighting 2 Rahkshi of Heat Vision, who are now more resistant to his light powers. He gains the upper hand over one, only to be hit by another one's beams. To save himself, he creates a hologram of himself, tricking the Rahkshi into hitting each other before finishing them. As he collects a piece of Golden Armor from one, he vows that it was time to crush Teridax's evil once and for all. At the same time, Tahu is fighting Nektann. The Skakdi tries to bait him into fighting without using his power, but Tahu doesn't fall for it. Instead, he uses his power to make his sword hot enough to melt through Nektann's Crescent Scythe, which cuts it in half. Tahu states pride does not count, only winning does. Nektann counters saying that maybe some of the Skakdi (in this case, the Piraka, who had beaten the Toa Nuva bad in Bionicle Legends #1 island of Doom) have beaten them, and then have made the Toa just like them. To this, Tahu says that he fights to save lives, unlike the Skakdi, who fight to take them. Challenging this, Nektann carries Tahu into the midst of the battle, so that he can't use his powers without killing his allies, but Tahu flips the Skakdi over, which negates Nektann's efforts. When Tahu states he's ready to do anything to win, the Skakdi rises up faster than he could have imagined, and chokes him, only to have his armor melted. Tahu then collects the Golden Armor piece, but leaves the Skakdi alive, after knocking him out. Chapter 10 Just as Teridax releases the gravitational blast, Mata Nui grabs Teridax's arm and jerks it into the air, causing the gravity blast to strike Aqua and Bota Magna instead, drawing them back towards Bara Magna. Teridax pushes Mata Nui away, but he responds with a relentless attack on Teridax, striking too quickly for Teridax to respond, driving him to the northernmost reaches of Bara Magna. Just before he could finish him off at his destination, however, the power of Mata Nui's robot body runs down. In response, Teridax punches Mata Nui, sending him crashing to the ground, and then gloats that he has won. Meanwhile, Tahu and Takanuva have gathered four pieces of the golden armor. As they wonder where the other two are, they notice Gresh in a fight with a Skakdi, who had defeated the 3 Skrall warriors earlier. Felling the Skakdi with heat and light, they take the two pieces in Gresh's satchel. Quickly, Tahu places them on, and wills the armor's power to activate. Immediately, power surges through him, locking his muscles with electricity, and causing his body to emit a blinding light. As he screams in pain, tendrils of energy launch out from him, coiling around every Rahkshi on the battlefield. The Rahkshi fall to the ground, seized by spasms as their power is pulled through the tendrils and into Tahu. Then, the Rahkshi armor disintegrate, and the Kraata inside explode into shards of shadow. With the Rahkshi dead, the Skakdi and Skrall quickly surrender or run away into the desert, as they are now greatly outnumbered. Up above, Teridax feels the deaths of his thousands of Rahkshi, causing him to hesitate for a moment. Taking advantage of this, Mata Nui shoves Teridax's body into the path of the jungle moon of Bota Magna, which smashes into his head and destroys his core processor, killing Teridax. But without Teridax controlling the robot body, its massive weight causes it to fall towards the desert of Bara Magna, which threatens to kill all of Mata Nui's friends. Using every bit of strength his robot body possessed, Mata Nui quickly pushes Teridax away onto the Black Spike Mountains, which crushes the mountain range to powder. At the same time, Bota Magna and Aqua Magna collide with Bara Magna, merging back into Spherus Magna.Farshtey, Greg (April 2010). BIONICLE: Journey's End, Chapter 10 Epilogue Tahu and Takanuva are looking at the fallen robot that houses the Matoran Universe as beings begin streaming out. Takanuva wonders if Makuta's really gone and if the Matoran can survive on Bara Magna, but Tahu is confident they can. From above, Mata Nui watches the inhabitants of the Matoran Universe meet with the Bara Magna's inhabitants and decides to give them a new place to live in. To do that, he combines his last energies with the Kanohi Ignika's and bathes Spherus Magna with life energy, making plants grow everywhere and rivers appear, healing all of the damage done to the planet, and making it even better than it had ever been. The energy also heals those in The Pit who have been mutated, which reverses the mutation done to them, while still allowing them to breathe water, and also removes the mutagen in the water, so that no one can be mutated again. But the effort is overwhelming, and because of the strain, and the depletion of energy, the robot falls apart. Kiina and Ackar, along with the other combatants (Toa, Matoran, Glatorian, Agori, others (etc.)) race to the site, only to see that nothing is left intact. However, they find the Mask of Life still intact, which suddenly begins hovering in the air. From the mask, Mata Nui, whose spirit was called back to it, in virtue of having inhabited it for so long, speaks to the assembled crowd, and refuses Tahu's request to remain to guide them. He only asks them to search for the Great Beings, to make them understand what he, too, has learned during his time on Bara Magna, so that he will be able to look forward to returning, on the day that the Great Beings return. Mata Nui then stops speaking, as he has gone dormant, and the mask falls into Kiina's hands. Tahu gently takes it from her, and declares that it was time to move on.

It describes the secret teachings of Jesus to Peter and James, given after the Resurrection but before the Ascension. A major theme is that one must accept suffering as inevitable. The prominence of James and Peter suggest that the work originated in the Jewish Christian community. It shows no dependence on canonical texts, and was probably written in the first half of the 2nd century. It has Gnostic affinities but cannot be attributed to any Gnostic sect, and some scholars rule that it is not Gnostic at all.\\"James, Apocryphal Epistle of.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005  Origin  The text survives in a single, damaged manuscript as the second section of the Jung Codex, first of the thirteen codices in the Nag Hammadi library. Although the text appears to be a Coptic translation from Greek, the author claims to have written in Hebrew. Because of references to persecution and martyrdom, it is unlikely that the text was written after 313, when Constantine I ended Christian persecution. Other clues in the text point to a composition in the 2nd century, and perhaps in the first half.  Content  The text is framed as an epistle (i.e. a letter) from James to someone else whose name is obscured by the damage to the text. The author describes Jesus expanding on various sayings and answering questions 550 days after the Resurrection, but before the Ascension. Both James and Peter are given secret instruction, but at the end only James appears to understand what has happened. (As with the Gospel of John 1‚Äì20 and the Gospel of Mary, in this book Peter has implicitly failed the Christian movement). Jesus gives teachings in unusual and seemingly contradictory phrases, and also offers brief parables. He invites Peter and James into the Kingdom of Heaven with him, but they are distracted by the other apostles' questions and miss their chance. Afterwards, James is described as sending out the 12 apostles, indicating (as in other apocryphal documents) that James initially succeeded Jesus as the leader of the movement. The brief framing letter appears independent of the remainder of the text, suggesting to some that the Apocryphon may have originated as multiple separate texts redacted together. This framing letter references a previous \\"secret gospel\\", which has apparently been lost. Within the Apocryphon, the discussions of martyrdom and prophecy also appear to be somewhat separate, indicating an original text, for the main body of the document, which was composed of brief sayings. It is still debated whether the closest parallels to the New Testament canon are part of the Apocryphon's last redactional hand or else part of its sources.  Relation to other texts  To many scholars, the flavor of the sayings appears somewhat gnostic in tone, primarily because its doctrines do not accord with orthodox interpretation of canonical scripture. The manuscript was also found among explicit gnostic teachings in the Nag Hammadi Library. The text also uses gnostic terms, such as referring to \\"fullness\\" as a means to salvation, but the doctrines in the Apocryphon of James certainly do not accord with the Valentinian or other developed gnostic cosmologies, so it is not usually counted as a truly gnostic text. Many of the sayings appear to be shared with the canonical Gospels, and the text includes this reference to other sayings: \\"It sufficed for some persons to pay attention to the teaching and understand 'The Shepherds' and 'The Seed' and 'The Building' and 'The Lamps of the Virgins' and 'The Wage of the Workers' and 'The Double Drachma' and 'The Woman'.\\" The references to salvation through \\"the cross\\" seem to imply familiarity with Paul's letters, or at least his teachings. But its introduction says, \\"And five hundred and fifty days after he arose from the dead, we said to him: ...\\", which is considerably longer than the forty days which Luke's Acts of the Apostles gives for the Ascension. Some have felt that this implies that the relationship of the Apocryphon of James with the canon is through oral tradition, and that the community which wrote it rejected or else did not know Luke-Acts. (On the other hand, Irenaeus in Against Heresies gave a time span of eighteen months, and Irenaeus was certainly familiar with the work.) Some scholars posit that the earliest version of the Apocryphon was independent of the canonical gospels, but that an unknown redactor knew of and referenced canonical works in the known edition.

They were part of the Tradition (), the unwritten code from which Romans derived their social norms. Roman cemeteries were located outside the sacred boundary of its cities ('). They were visited regularly with offerings of food and wine, and special observances during Roman festivals in honor of the dead. Funeral monuments appear throughout the Roman Empire, and their inscriptions are an important source of information for otherwise unknown individuals and history. A Roman sarcophagus could be an elaborately crafted art work, decorated with relief sculpture depicting a scene that was allegorical, mythological, or historical, or a scene from everyday life. Although funerals were primarily a concern of the family, which was of paramount importance in Roman society, those who lacked the support of an extended family usually belonged to guilds or collegia which provided funeral services for members. Care of the dead In Greco-Roman antiquity, the bodies of the dead were regarded as polluting.Michele Renee Salzman, \\"Religious koine and Religious Dissent,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 116. At the same time, loving duty toward one's ancestors (') was a fundamental part of ancient Roman culture.Stefan Heid, \\"The Romanness of Roman Christianity,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 408. The care of the dead negotiated these two emotionally opposed attitudes. =Preparation of the body= When a person died at home, family members and intimate friends gathered around the death bed. In accordance with a belief that equated the soul with the breath, the closest relative gave the last goodbye to the passing of spirit from the body with a last kiss, and closed the eyes. The relatives began lamentations, calling on the deceased by name. The body was then placed on the ground, washed, and anointed. This practice mirrored the placement of new-born infants on the bare earth.Anthony Corbeill, Nature Embodied: Gesture in Ancient Rome (Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 90, with a table of other parallels between birth and death rituals on p. 91. Mourners were expected to dress in a manner appropriate to the occasion and to their station (for example, an upper class citizen would wear a dark-colored toga (toga pulla), reserved for funerals).A plain white toga was also acceptable; those with a toga praetexta could turn it inside out, to conceal its purple stripe; see Flower, Harriet F., Ancestor Masks and Aristocratic Power in Roman Culture, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 102Heskel, J., in Sebesta, Judith Lynn, and Bonfante, Larissa (Editors) The World of Roman Costume: Wisconsin Studies in Classics, The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp. 141-142, citing Cicero, In P. Vatinium testem oratio for the etiquette associated with the toga pulla. If the deceased was a male citizen, he was dressed in his toga; if he had earned a wreath in life, he wore one in death.J.M.C. Toynbee, Death and Burial in the Roman World (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971, 1996), pp. 43‚Äì44. Wreaths also are found in burials of initiates into mystery religions.Minucius Felix, Octavius 28.3‚Äì4; Mark J. Johnson, ‚ÄúPagan-Christian Burial Practices of the Fourth Century: Shared Tombs?‚Äù Journal of Early Christian Studies 5 (1997), p. 45. After the body was prepared, it lay in state in the atrium of the family home ('), with the feet pointed toward the door.Toynbee, Death and Burial, p. 44. Other circumstances pertained to those who lived, as most Romans did, in apartment buildings ('), but elite practices are better documented. Although embalming was unusual and regarded as mainly an Egyptian practice, it is mentioned in Latin literature, with a few instances documented by archaeology in Rome and throughout the Empire where no Egyptian influence can be assumed.Toynbee, Death and Burial, pp. 39, 41‚Äì42. Since elite funerals required complex arrangements, the body had to be preserved in the meantime.Heller, L. John, Burial Customs of the Romans, (Washington: Classical Association of the Atlantic States, 1932), 194. Other customs \\"Charon's obol\\" was a coin placed in or on the mouthNo ancient Greek or Latin source says that coins were placed on the eyes; the archaeological evidence points overwhelming to placement in or on the mouth, in or near the hand, or loosely in the grave. Coins that could be interpreted as placement on the eyes is relatively rare. of the deceased. The custom is recorded in literary sources and attested by archaeology, and sometimes occurs in contexts that suggest it may have been imported to Rome as were the mystery religions that promised initiates salvation or special passage in the afterlife. The custom was explained by the myth of Charon, the ferryman who conveyed the souls of the newly dead across the water ‚Äî a lake, river, or swamp ‚Äî that separated the world of the living from the underworld. The coin was rationalized as his payment; the satirist Lucian remarks that in order to avoid death, one should simply not pay the fee. In Apuleius's tale of \\"Cupid and Psyche\\" in his Metamorphoses, framed by Lucius's quest for salvation ending with initiation into the mysteries of Isis, Psyche (\\"Soul\\") carries two coins in her journey to the underworld, the second to enable her return or symbolic rebirth. Evidence of \\"Charon's obol\\" appears throughout the Western Roman Empire well into the Christian era, but at no time and place was it practiced consistently and by all. =Disposal of the body= Tomb of the Scipios, in use from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD Although inhumation was practiced regularly in archaic Rome, cremation was the most common burial practice in the Mid- to Late Republic and the Empire into the 1st and 2nd centuries. Crematory images appear in Latin poetry on the theme of the dead and mourning. In one of the best-known classical Latin poems of mourning, Catullus writes of his long journey to attend to the funeral rites of his brother, who died abroad, and expresses his grief at addressing only silent ash.Catullus, Carmen 101, line 4 (mutam ‚Ä¶ cinerem). When Propertius describes his dead lover Cynthia visiting him in a dream, the revenant's dress is scorched down the side and the fire of the pyre has corroded the familiar ring she wears.Propertius 4.7.8‚Äì9. Ultimately, inhumation would replace cremation; a variety of factors, including decreasing levels of urbanization and changes in attitudes to the afterlife, would contribute to this marked shift in popular burial practices. The care and cultivation of the dead did not end with the funeral and formal period of mourning, but was a perpetual obligation. Libations were brought to the grave, and some tombs were even equipped with \\"feeding tubes\\" to facilitate delivery .  Arpagi  The Romans referred to infants who died in the cradle as arpagi (singular arpagus). The Romans did not hold funerals for arpagi. Their bodies were not cremated, or interred, and no monuments or epitaphs were made for them. Eventually, infants who had lived 40 or more days and had cut teeth before their deaths were distinguished from the arpagi; they were referred to as rapti, and they were cremated. Funeral rites Funeral rites took place at home and at the place of burial,Frances Hickson Hahn, \\"Performing the Sacred: Prayers and Hymns,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 238. which was located outside the city to avoid the pollution of the living.Salzman, \\"Religious koine and Religious Dissent,\\" p. 116. The funeral procession (pompa funebris) transited the distance between the two. A professional guild (') of musicians specialized in funeral music.Friederike Fless and Katja Moede, \\"Music and Dance: Forms of Representation in Pictorial and Written Sources,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 252. Horace mentions the tuba and the cornu, two bronze trumpet- like instruments, at funerals.Horace Satire 1.6.45. =Eulogy= Fragment of a relief from a sarcophagus depicting stages of the deceased's life: religious initiation, military service, and wedding (mid-2nd century AD) The eulogy (') was a formal oration or panegyric in praise of the dead. It was one of two forms of discourse at a Roman funeral, the other being the chant (').Ann Suter, Lament: Studies in the Ancient Mediterranean and Beyond (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 258. The practice is associated with noble families, and the conventions for words spoken at an ordinary person's funeral go unrecorded. While oratory was practiced in Rome only by men, an elite woman might also be honored with a eulogy. For socially prominent individuals, the funeral procession stopped at the forum for the public delivery of the eulogy from the Rostra.Geoffrey S. Sumi, \\"Power and Ritual: The Crowd at Clodius' Funeral,\\" Historia 46.1 (1997), p. 96. Thus a well-delivered funeral oration could be a way for a young politician to publicize himself.Brendon Reay, \\"Agriculture, Writing, and Cato's Aristocratic Self-Fashioning,\\" Classical Antiquity 24.2 (2005), p. 354. Aunt Julia's Eulogy ('), a speech made by the young Julius Caesar in honor of his aunt, the widow of Gaius Marius, helped launch his political career as a populist.Gerard B. Lavery, \\"Cicero's Philarchia and Marius,\\" Greece & Rome 18.2 (1971), p. 139. The epitaph of the deceased in effect was a digest of the eulogy made visible and permanent,R.G. Lewis, Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt (1993), p. 658. and might include the career (cursus honorum) of a man who had held public offices. In commemorating past deeds, the eulogy was a precursor to Roman historiography. =Sacrifices= After the body was carried to the cemetery, a sacrifice was performed in the presence of the corpse. Until the time of Cicero, it was customary to offer a sow to Ceres, a sow also being a characteristic offering to chthonic deities. The sacrificial victim was then allotted for consumption among the participants. The portion for the deceased was put on a spit and cremated with the body. Ceres' portion was burned on an altar. The family ate the portion that was due the living. A family of lesser means offered a libation of wine, incense, produce or grain; the allocation of these offerings is not recorded.John Scheid, \\"Sacrifices to Gods and Ancestors,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, pp. 264, 270. After this apportioning, the deceased had transitioned and could no longer share in the meals of the living and the domestic gods; they now partook of what was appropriate for the spirits of the dead, the Manes.Scheid, \\"Sacrifices to Gods and Ancestors,\\" p. 271. The so-called Togatus Barberini in the Capitoline Museums may represent a senator holding two ancestral funerary portraits (imagines) =Novendialis= On the ninth day after the person died, the funeral feast and rites called the novendialis or novemdialis were held.Salzman, \\"Religious koine and Religious Dissent,\\" p. 115. A libation to the Manes was poured onto the grave. This concluded the period of full mourning.Toynbee, Death and Burial in the Roman World, p. 51. Mourning dress was put aside, and a feast was given.To wear mourning dress at the feast was considered an insult to the host, suggesting that he had somehow vitiated the funeral rites; see Heskel, J., in Sebesta, Judith Lynn, and Bonfante, Larissa (Editors) The World of Roman Costume: Wisconsin Studies in Classics, The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp. 141-142 Commemorations =Festivals of the dead= In February, the last month of the original Roman calendar when March 1 was New Year's Day, the dead were honored at a nine-day festival called the Parentalia, followed by the Feralia on February 21, when the potentially malign spirits of the dead were propitiated. During the Parentalia, families gathered at cemeteries to offer meals to the ancestors, and then shared wine and cakes among themselves (compare veneration of the dead in other cultures). Tombs for wealthy, prominent families were constructed as \\"houses\\", with a decorated room for these banqueting festivities.Regina Gee, \\"From Corpse to Ancestor: The Role of Tombside Dining in the Transformation of the Body in Ancient Rome,\\" in The Materiality of Death: Bodies, Burials, Beliefs, Bar International Series 1768 (Oxford, 2008), p. 59ff. =Epitaphs= Epitaphs are one of the major classes of inscriptions. An epitaph usually noted the person's day of birth and lifespan. Information varies, but collectively they offer information on family relationships, political offices,Jack N. Lightstone, \\"Roman Diaspora Judaism,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 350. and Roman values, in choosing what aspects of the deceased's life to praise. Philosophical beliefs may also be in evidence. The epitaphs of Epicureans often expressed some form of the sentiment non fui, fui, non sum, non desidero, \\"I did not exist, I have existed, I do not exist, I feel no desire,\\"CIL 8.3463; Attilio Mastrocinque, \\"Creating One's Own Religion: Intellectual Choice,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, p. 379. or non fui, non sum, non curo, \\"I did not exist, I do not exist, I'm not concerned about it.\\"These became such standard sentiments that abbreviations came into inscriptional usage, for this last example NF NS NC. =Funerary art= \\"Images\\" Noble Roman families often displayed a series of \\"images\\" ( ', ') in the atrium of their family home. There is some uncertainty about whether these \\"images\\" were funeral masks, busts, or both together. The \\"images\\" could be arranged in a family tree, with a title (') summarizing the individual's offices held (') and accomplishments ('),R.G. Lewis, \\"Imperial Autobiography, Augustus to Hadrian,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.34.1 (1993), p. 658. a practice that might be facilitated by hanging masks.Rabun Taylor, \\"Roman Oscilla: An Assessment,\\" RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics 48 (2005) 83‚Äì105. In any case, portrait busts of family members in stone or bronze were displayed in the home as well.Lewis, \\"Imperial Autobiography,\\" p. 658. Funeral masks were most likely made of wax and possibly molded as death masks directly from the deceased. They were worn in the funeral procession either by actors who were professional mourners, or by appropriate members of the family. Practice may have varied by period or by family, since sources give no consistent account.Walker & Burnett, pp. 9-10 The display of ancestral images in aristocratic houses of the Republic and the public funerals are described by Pliny, Natural History 35, 4-11.Winkes, Rolf: Imago Clipeata, Studien zu einer r√∂mischen Bildnisform, Bonn 1969. Winkes, Rolf: Pliny's chapter on Roman funeral customs (American Journal of Archaeology 83, 1979, 481-484) Since references to \\"images\\" often fail to distinguish between commemorative portrait busts, extant examples of which are abundant, or funeral masks made of more perishable materials, none can be identified with certainty as having survived. The veristic tradition of funerary likenesses, however, contributed to the development of realistic Roman portraiture. In Roman Egypt, the Fayum mummy portraits reflect traditions of Egyptian and Roman funerary portraiture and the techniques of Hellenistic painting. Sarcophagi The funerary urns in which the ashes of the cremated were placed were gradually overtaken in popularity by the sarcophagus as inhumation became more common. Particularly in the 2nd‚Äì4th centuries, these were often decorated with reliefs that became an important vehicle for Late Roman sculpture. The scenes depicted were drawn from mythology, religious beliefs pertaining to the mysteries, allegories, history, or scenes of hunting or feasting. Many sarcophagi depict Nereids, fantastical sea creatures, and other marine imagery that may allude to the location of the Isles of the Blessed across the sea, with a portrait of the deceased on a seashell.Donald Strong, Roman Art (Yale University Press, 1995, 3rd edition, originally published 1976), pp. 125-126, 231. The sarcophagus of a child may show tender representations of family life, Cupids, or children playing.

Some sarcophagi may have been ordered during the person's life and custom-made to express their beliefs or aesthetics. Most were mass-produced, and if they contained a portrait of the deceased, as many did, with the face of the figure left unfinished until purchase.Strong, Roman Art, p. 231. The carved sarcophagus survived the transition to Christianity, and became the first common location for Christian sculpture, in works like the mid 4th-century Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus.Strong, Roman Art, pp. 287-291 =Tombs= Wealthy vs. Commoners Ancient Rome has become an excavation site known for its rather extravagant cemeteries. All in all, the commoners and wealthy families of Rome were buried in the same cemeteries; the wealthy, however, had more elaborate tombs. The tombs of the wealthy were typically cut out of bedrock and rectangular in shape.Berlin, M. Andrea, Power and Its Afterlife: Tombs in Hellenistic Palestine, (Boston: The American Schools of Oriental Research, 2002), 138. These rectangular tombs resembled the Ancient Roman's house structure, having doors, and many different chambers.Themos, Athanasios, The Southwest Cemetery of Roman Sparta: A preliminary account of the results of three rescue excavations, (London: The British School at Athens, 2009), 263. Of these chambers, one of them was used to hold the dead's memorial ceremony. During this ceremony, the family of the deceased would get together and have dinner. Other chambers were used to house anything thought necessary for the person laid to rest ‚Äì including portraits of the deceased and any paraphernalia needed for the memorial ceremony that had yet to come.Heller, L. John, Burial Customs of the Romans, (Washington: Classical Association of the Atlantic States, 1932), 197. Wealthy and prominent families had large, sometimes enormous, mausoleums. The Castel Sant'Angelo by the Vatican, originally the mausoleum of Hadrian, is the best preserved, as it was converted to a fortress.Blagg, Thomas, in Henig, Martin (ed), A Handbook of Roman Art, pp. 64-65, Phaidon, 1983, The Tomb of the Scipios was the family tomb of the Scipios, located in an aristocratic cemetery, and in use from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD. A grand mausoleum might include bedrooms and kitchens for family visits which would include feasts. For the wealthy middle class, smaller mausolea lined the roads from cities, many of which still remain in the Tombs of Via Latina, along the Appian Way, and elsewhere. The Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker is a famous and originally very ostentatious tomb in a prime spot just outside the Porta Maggiore, erected for a rich freedman baker around 50‚Äì20 BC.Strong, Roman Art, p. 125 The tombs at Petra, in the far east of the Empire are cut into cliffs, some with elaborate facades in the \\"baroque\\" style of the Imperial period. The less wealthy made do with smaller tombs, often featuring relief busts over a lengthy inscription. People who were typically less lucrative and made a living in poorer communities were often disregarded in public places, lacking any sort of ceremonial processes. Cheaper still were the Catacombs of Rome, famously used by Christians, but also by all religions, with some specialization, such as special Jewish sections. These were large systems of narrow tunnels in the soft rock below Rome, where niches were sold to the families of the deceased in a very profitable, if rather smelly, trade. Decoration included paintings, many of which have survived.Strong, Roman Art, pp. 291-296 The exterior of the tomb resembled that of a garden. Beautiful flowers and plants decked the outside of the tombs and made them more flattering to the eye. This was probably where the tradition of bringing flowers to a loved one's grave site began. Other items were also added to the outside of the wealthy's tombs to make it more decorative. The burial chamber of the deceased was above ground and stocked with relics that were important to the deceased Roman. Lack of relics found in excavated tombs was most probably due to grave robbing. In the Christian period, it became desirable to be buried near the grave of a famous martyr, and large funeral halls were opened over such graves, which were often in a catacomb underneath. These contained rows of tombs, but also space for meals for the family, now probably to be seen as agape feasts. Many of the large Roman churches began as funeral halls, which were originally private enterprises; the family of Constantine owned the one over the grave of Saint Agnes of Rome, whose ruins are next to Santa Costanza, originally a Constantinian family mausoleum forming an apse to the hall.Webb, Matilda. The churches and catacombs of early Christian Rome: a comprehensive guide, pp. 249-252.Blagg, Handbook, p. 65 Military funerals and burial Germanic cavalryman (1st century AD, Xanten) \\"The cult of the dead,\\" it has been noted,Yann Le Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army (Routledge, 2001, originally published 1989 in French), p. 251. \\"was particularly important to men whose profession exposed them to a premature demise.\\" The Roman value of pietas encompassed the desire of soldiers to honor their fallen comrades, though the conditions of war might interfere with the timely performance of traditional rites.Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army, p. 251. Soldiers killed in battle on foreign soil with ongoing hostilities were probably given a mass cremation or burial.Toynbee, Death and Burial, p. 55. Under less urgent circumstances, they might be cremated individually, and their ashes placed in a vessel for transport to a permanent burial site.Graham Webster, The Roman Imperial Army of the First and Second Centuries A.D. (University of Oklahoma Press, 1985, 1998, 3rd edition), pp. 280‚Äì281. When the Roman army under the command of Publius Quinctilius Varus suffered their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, they remained uncommemorated until Germanicus and his troops located the battlefield a few years later and made a funeral mound for their remains.Pat Southern, The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 296. In the permanent garrisons of the Empire, a portion of each soldier's pay was set aside and pooled for funeral expenses, including the ritual meal, the burial, and commemoration.Webster, The Roman Imperial Army, pp. 267, 280. Soldiers who died of illness or an accident during the normal routines of life would have been given the same rites as in civilian life.Le Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army, p. 251. The first burial clubs for soldiers were formed under Augustus; burial societies had existed for civilians long before. Veterans might pay into a fund upon leaving the service, insuring a decent burial by membership in an association for that purpose.Le Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army, p. 192. Tombstones and monuments throughout the Empire document military personnel and units stationed at particular camps (castra). If the body could not be recovered, the death could be commemorated with a cenotaph. Epitaphs on Roman military tombstones usually give the soldier's name, his birthplace, rank and unit, age and years of service, and sometimes other information such as the names of his heirs. Some more elaborate monuments depict the deceased, either in his parade regaliaWebster, The Roman Imperial Army, p.280. or in civilian dress to emphasize his citizenship.Le Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army, p. 125. Cavalrymen are often shown riding over the body of a downtrodden foe, an image interpreted as a symbolic victory over death.Webster, The Roman Imperial Army, p. 280. Military funeral monuments from Roman Africa take progressively more substantial forms: steles in the 1st century, altars in the 2nd, and cupulas (mounds) in the 3rd. Tombs were often grouped in military cemeteries along the roads that led out of the camp. A centurion might be well-off enough to have a mausoleum built.Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army, p.251. If a commander was killed in action, the men rode or marched around his pyre, or in some circumstances a cenotaph. Afterlife =Religion= Standard accounts of Roman mythology describe the soul as immortal Final Farewell: The Culture of Death and the Afterlife: Greece and Italy and judged at death before a tribunal in the underworld, with those who had done good being sent to the Elysian Fields and those who had done ill sent to Tartarus.http://www.theologywebsite.com/history/afterlife.shtml Church History Study Helps: Death and the Afterlife in Greco-Roman Religion It is unclear how ancient such beliefs were, as they seem influenced by Greek mythology and mystery cults. The mysteries continued under Rome and seem to have promised immortality only for the initiated. Known forms of esoteric religion combined Roman, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern mythology and astrology, describing the progress of its initiates through the regions of the moon, sun, and stars. The uninitiated or virtueless were then left behind, the underworld becoming solely a place of torment. Common depictions of the afterlife of the bless include rest, a celestial banquet, and the vision of God (' or Jupiter). =Philosophy= The mainstream of Roman philosophy, such as the Stoics, advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals. \\"It is necessary for some to stay and for others to go, all the while rejoicing with those who are with us, yet not grieving for those departing.\\"Epictetus, Disc., III.xxiv.11. To grieve bitterly is to fail to perceive and accept the nature of things. Famously, Epictetus encouraged contemplation of one's loved ones as a \\"jar\\" or \\"crystal cup\\" which might break and be remembered without troubling the spirit, since \\"you love a mortal, something not your own. It has been given to you for the present, not inseparably nor forever, but like a fig... at a fixed season of the year. If you yearn for it in the winter, you are a fool.\\"Epictetus, Disc., III.xxiv.84‚Äì87. There was no real consensus, at least among surviving Roman texts and epitaphs, of what happened to a person after death or the existence of an afterlife. Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia claims that most people are of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, that there are people who believe in the immortality of the soul.Post sepulturam vanae manium ambages, omnibus a supremo die eadem quae ante primum, nec magis a morte sensus ullus aut corpori aut animae quam ante natalem. eadem enim vanitas in futurum etiam se propagat et in mortis quoque tempora ipsa sibi vitam mentitur, alias inmortalitatem animae, alias transfigurationem ‚Äì VII.188 Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body.Motto, A. L. (1995, January). Seneca on Death and Immortality. The Classical Journal, 50(4), 187-189. Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the piousSi quis piorum minibus locus, si, ut sapientibus placet, non cum corpore extiguuntur magnae animae - XLVI ‚Äì which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium. It is important to keep in mind that these are the opinions of a select few well-educated elite males and may not be characteristic of all of Roman views.

He first appears in the 1984 Ghostbusters film as a logo on a bag of marshmallows in Dana Barrett's apartment, on an advertisement on a building near the Ghostbusters' headquarters, and finally as the physical manifestation of the apocalyptic Sumerian deity Gozer. Subsequently, he has been incorporated into many other types of Ghostbusters media, including the animated series The Real Ghostbusters, comic books, a stage show, and several video games. In the Ghostbusters universe, he is the mascot of the fictional Stay-Puft Marshmallow Corporation, much like Michelin's Bibendum (also known as the \\"Michelin Man\\") and the Pillsbury Doughboy, both of whom he resembles. Within that universe, he is also the star of a Marshmallow Man cartoon series. Appearance and character Stay-Puft is a large white humanoid figure made of conjoined marshmallows. He wears a white sailor cap with a red ribbon attached on top, and a blue hatband. Around his neck is a traditional blue sailor's collar and a red neckerchief. After images of him are seen on an advertisement and a bag of the marshmallows earlier in the film, he is then seen in the climax of Ghostbusters as one of two physical manifestations of Gozer, a god who is defeated when Stay-Puft is destroyed. Stay-Puft's exact to-scale height in the movie is 112.5 feet (34.3 m) tall, while his height in the novelization of the movie is given at 100 feet (30.5 m). He is then resurrected and subsequently captured a number of different times by the Ghostbusters. Although mean and destructive at first, he later befriends Slimer and the Ghostbusters in the animated series The Real Ghostbusters, and helps them out with various problems. Concept and debut Dan Aykroyd conceived of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man for his initial script for Ghostbusters the movie. He created the character to show that \\"it seems harmless and puffy and cute‚Äîbut given the right circumstances, everything can be turned black and become evil\\". Stay- Puft was only one of many large-scale monsters in this early draft of the script, but after Aykroyd worked with co-writer Harold Ramis and director Ivan Reitman, the team scaled back the intended sequence until only Stay-Puft remained out of the original large-scale monsters. The likeness of Stay-Puft was inspired by Peter O'Boyle, a security guard at Columbia Pictures whom Reitman met while filming his previous movie, Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone (1983). According to Sam Delaney of The Guardian, \\"Stay-Puft's familiar mascot combined elements of real-life brand ambassadors the Pillsbury Doughboy and Bibendum (a.k.a. the Michelin Tire Man).\\" Stay-Puft is seen only briefly in the movie. He is \\"conjured up\\"Richard Mueller, author of \\"Ghostbusters, The Supernatural; Spectacular, page 240, Tor Edition as a new form for the Sumerian god Gozer, who previously arrives atop an apartment building at 55 Central Park West in New York City in the form of an androgynous woman with metallic skin and eyes. After a quick battle with the Ghostbusters, Gozer vanishes and in Its disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters, \\"Choose the form of The Destructor\\" ‚Äì whatever they think of will be the form It will assume to destroy their world. Ray Stantz (Aykroyd) instead makes the decision to think of this marshmallow mascot when the Ghostbusters are given a choice as to which physical form Gozer will destroy the world in. As he explains, \\"It just popped in there\\", and that he \\"tried to think of the most harmless thing\\", describing Mr. Stay-Puft as \\"something that could never possibly destroy us\\". Moments later, a giant Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man is seen walking towards the apartment building. The Ghostbusters shoot at Stay-Puft with their proton packs, setting him on fire, but do not succeed in stopping his advance. They then get the idea of shooting at the portal through which the god emerged, by crossing the streams of all four of their packs. The plan triggers an explosion that destroys the gate and Stay-Puft, reducing the latter into molten marshmallow cream that rains down onto the roof of the skyscraper and bystanders on the street below. =Special effects= The character as seen in the movie was created by Linda Frobos by using miniatures and optical compositing with Billy Bryan himself in a latex suit. The suit was made of two layers, an outer flammable layer and inner fire-proof layer. Some of the finished movie's most noticeable errors appear in the Stay-Puft scenes: he is seen with and without his bow tie, while in other scenes the optical rendering was so poor that he passes through a church rather than crushing it. Also, the blue portion of his sailor suit is worn backwards. Adaptations =Games= In Activision's Ghostbusters (1984), designed by David Crane, small ghosts terrorize the city and gather together in front of the \\"Zuul Building\\" and occasionally other locations, where after enough of them have collected they would form the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, who could destroy some of the nearby buildings. After enough ghosts have entered the Zuul Building, the player could then go to it and find Stay-Puft moving back and forth blocking the entrance. If the player could pass him without being squashed, the player would then climb the stairs and either win the game or find the final boss Gozer at the top of the building, in the form of a woman. On the NES version, Stay-Puft is seen again from the roof on a screen just, below the final boss. He is climbing the building and acts as a counter: if he reaches the top of the building the game ends. * In Ghostbusters (1990) for the Sega Genesis, \\"Stay-Puft\\" appears outside a highrise building punching inward as the player progresses through the level and then appears as a boss at the top of the building, but is not related to Gozer. Here he claims to have eaten too many marshmallows, then realizing he had become the Marshmallow Man. In addition to trying to punch the player from the left and right sides of the screen, he also uses special powers such as breathing fire and shooting laser bolts from his eyes. * As described further in this article, the Stay- Puft Marshmallow Man appears as a boss in all versions of the 2009 game Ghostbusters: The Video Game. * In TT Games' Lego Dimensions, he is a playable character in the game, with archive audio from the first film for his dialogue. He comes in his own Fun Pack, with a terror dog as his personal vehicle. He is also a boss in the Ghostbusters Level Pack and the Answer the Call Story Pack in brick built form. * As part of Rocket League's Haunted Hallows event, Stay-Puff's appearance is used for wheels, a car topper, and a goal explosion. =Stage productions= In the Ghostbusters Spooktacular stage show (1990‚Äì1996) at Universal Studios, Florida, the ending battle with Stay-Puft has the Ghostbusters destroying him directly, rather than firing at the portal to close the dimensional gateway. Post-movie appearances Outside of appearances in the television series, Stay-Puft (seen here menacing the Ghostbusters and Slimer) appeared in numerous issues of the various Ghostbusters comicbook series as well. From The Real Ghostbusters #138. Published by Marvel UK. Following the original film, the television series The Real Ghostbusters brought Stay-Puft back; in fact Joe Medjuck, the executive producer of the show, states that Stay-Puft was in the first script they received from Dan Aykroyd on the series. In the episode titled, \\"Mr. Sandman, Dream Me a Dream\\", a spectral Sandman creates versions of anything which a person is dreaming of ‚Äì in this way a new version of Stay-Puft is created ‚Äì however, whatever is created disappears when the person awakens. In the episode \\"Dedcon 1\\", Stay-Puft appears as a guest of honor at a ghost convention. After another episode, \\"Cry Uncle\\", he is accidentally freed from the Ghostbusters' containment system and later recaptured. He reappears in episode 65, \\"The Revenge of Murray the Mantis\\", where he is \\"released\\" from the Ghostbusters' containment unit to help defeat a giant mantis too powerful for the Ghostbusters to fight on their own. Stay-Puft is controlled with the help of Slimer (a green blob-like creature). After defeating the Mantis, Stay- Puft floats behind the Ghostbusters in a parade. He later helps them again in the episode \\"Sticky Business\\" number 85, when the president of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Company asks the Ghostbusters if he can use their large Stay-Puft in a television commercial. Once again Slimer goes into the containment unit to bring Stay-Puft out. An episode explains that Egon took a sample of the marshmallow ectoplasm and positively charged it, thus creating a friendly version of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man that would assist the Ghostbusters when needed. When questioned by a policeman in the series about the abrupt personality change, Peter replied that Stay-Puft was \\"all better now\\". The character was voiced by John Stocker, and later by Frank Welker in this series. Set two years after the events in the film Ghostbusters II (1989), the Atari game Ghostbusters: The Video Game (2009) brings back the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man to ravage Times Square while searching for Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn. Stay-Puft has the ability to spawn tiny marshmallow monsters which do his bidding. Peter, Ray, and a new rookie escort Dr. Selwyn to the roof of a tall building. In pursuit, Stay-Puft climbs the side of the building while Egon at street level preparing a large trap. The rookie burns Stay-Puft's face with \\"Boson Darts\\" from an upgraded proton pack, causing Stay-Puft to fall to street level, where he exploded upon impact, scattering his marshmallow body all over Times Square and his hat, which hangs from one of the neighboring buildings. Towards the game's climax, the characters realize that Gozer assumed the form of Stay-Puft again because he can only have one destructor form for each dimension he enters; he was locked into the form of the Marshmallow Man when summoned back to the Earthly plane. This causes Ray to admit he had not selected such a bad destructor after all. In the realistic version, the player can listen to one of the in-game answering machine messages from an upset member of the fictional company that owns the Stay-Puft Marshmallow brand (voiced by Chuck Huber), who is unhappy with the recent Gozer/Stay-Puft attack believing it was a publicity stunt by the Ghostbusters. A Stay-Puft Figurine appears as one of the collectible paranormal objects found in the game; it is found in the kitchen area of the Sedgewick Hotel and, after being collected, will appear in the Ghostbuster Firehouse's bunkhouse. Merchandise Along with the original 1986 Kenner line of Ghostbusters toys, Stay-Puft has been included in: * McDonald's Happy Meals * Specialized monster kits such as those by Tsukuda, who made models of both Stay-Puft and the Terror Dog from the first movie. * In 2009, Diamond Select Toys released Stay- Puft in 2-inch Minimates mini-figure form as well as 11-inch vinyl bank form. The bank received an angry version at Comic-Con that same year, and glow-in- the-dark versions of both were released in 2010. * In 2010, and then (redesigned) in 2012, the Stay-Puft Quality brand of gourmet marshmallows were released as official Ghostbusters merchandise with packaging prominently featuring the title character. * Stay-Puft was not present in Mattel's 2009 Ghostbusters toy line, however, Mattel released him as an exclusive collectable for San Diego Comic-Con 2011 and on MattyCollector.com after the show. This was the biggest version of Stay-Puft to date; he was 20 inches tall, and covered in a soft foam covering. * In 2011, Rubie's Costume Co. released an inflatable Stay-Puft Halloween costume as a companion piece for the Ghostbusters jumpsuit costumes they had previously created. * In July 2011, Diamond Select Toys (DST) released a seven-inch light-up statue version of Stay-Puft. * Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man is playable in Lego Dimensions. He was released in a fun pack with a Terror Dog vehicle/gadget on March 15, 2016. * Several POP! Vinyl figures of Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man were released by Funko. * In June 2016, Build-A-Bear Workshop released a stuffed version of Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man as a part of their 2016 Ghostbusters collection. * Circa 2017, Playmobil created a version apparently similar to the 1980s \\"The Real Ghostbusters\\" action figure version. * In 2017, Bandai created an S.H.

Auel published in April 2002. It is the sequel to The Plains of Passage - published 12 years earlier - and fifth in the Earth's Children series. It describes the return of Jondalar to his homeland along with Ayla. Plot summary Central to this book is the tension created by Ayla's healing art, her pregnancy, and the acceptance of her by Jondalar's people, the Zelandonii. Ayla was raised by Clan Neanderthals, known as \\"flatheads\\" to the Zelandonii and viewed as no better than animals. For the Zelandonii to accept Ayla they must first overcome their prejudice against the Neanderthals. Luckily for Ayla and Jondalar, some of the higher-ranking Zelandonii already have doubts of this misjudgment. Two of their number, Echozar and Brukeval, are of partial Neanderthal ancestry and are ashamed of it. Echozar at least is pacified by Ayla's own story and by his (Echozar's) own marriage to Joplaya, Jondalar's close-cousin (half-sister). Brukeval, on the other hand, rejects his heritage utterly and refuses to listen to reason. Jondalar's first romantic interest, Zelandoni, formerly known as Zolena, has now become the First among the spiritual leaders. She supports adopting Ayla into their society, if not least for the healing arts she brings to the cave, although Ayla also must overcome the feeling that she is uncomfortable with a full connection with the spirit world. After Ayla helps a mortally injured hunter live long enough to see his mate, the First senses that Ayla needs to be brought into the fold of the Zelandonia (mystics, named after their culture so as to identify themselves with it) so that she will be accepted as a healer by all the people of the cave. At one point, Ayla persuades the native mothers to nurse a neglected infant, on the pretext that even a \\"flathead\\" would have done so in their place. This both shames them into agreeing (as noted by Jondalar's sister-in- law, Proleva) and educates the Zelandonii in the ways of their ex-neighbors. Ayla is drawn ever closer to an as-yet-undetermined role in the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii. Her knowledge of the healing arts as well as hunting force her to accept a role in the spiritual leadership of the group. Through it all Jondalar is waiting for the summer meeting and matrimonial that will finally \\"tie the knot\\" for the two of them. This has been his ultimate goal since The Valley of Horses. Their daughter, Jonayla, named for her mother's belief a man's \\"essence\\" creates babies, which leads to Jondalar and Ayla each being part of the baby, not just their spirits, is born sometime after this event. Not long after the birth, Ayla finally decides to become Zelandoni's acolyte, if only so that the members of the Zelandonii will accept her as a healer. This book is set in what is now the V√©z√®re valley, near to Les Eyzies, in the Dordogne, southwest France. It was relatively densely populated in prehistoric times, with many open cliff-top dwellings that can still be seen, some of which have been turned into tourist attractions. The national museum of prehistory is located in this valley. Ayla also discovers the world-famous cave of Lascaux, which her adopted people subsequently paint.

Plot summary The protagonist of this novel, Anthony Greville, is a Member of Parliament who is married with two children. His son Adam is seventeen and his daughter Sophie is eight. Despite the outward perfection of his life, Greville is having an affair with sculptor Natalia Jones, an enigmatic mother of two who is married to a husband in politics who cheats on her. Greville's wife is away at the family's country retreat for weeks on end and his children at their respective schools, so Greville enjoys his lover's company with minimal risk of being discovered. However, as smitten with Natalia as Greville is, he has a brief fling with a woman named Madeleine, as well. In spite of his easy lifestyle, Greville is not a happy man. The focus of this novel is based on Greville's dissatisfactions and confusions. For instance, although Natalia does not make any demands on him, and his wife prefers not to see what is going on, Greville is torn between the two women. He wants to be with Natalia when he is with his wife and vice versa. What is more, he sees two people in his lover. To Anthony Greville, Natalia is an angelic figure who also symbolizes a diametrical opposite, specifically demonic. This dual perception of his lover leads him call her by two different names (Natalie and Natalia). Greville becomes disillusioned with politics, because he feels that political gaming prefers stalemate to partisanship,and therefore, opposes real change. Subsequently, Greville states that he is going to resign from Parliament as soon as possible. This is a startling announcement because Greville comes from a family of politicians, and his son is already active in grassroots politics. However, before his intended resignation, he must complete a final diplomatic mission as an MP; he journeys to Central Africa to meet Ndoula, a controversial freedom fighter who has been imprisoned by the colonial powers. While he is in Africa, without the emotional chaos of his personal life, Greville begins to introspect, writing and trying to make sense of his life. When Greville returns to England, he finds that both his wife and his idealistic son are leaving for Africa in order to help the current crisis. Greville sees them off at the airport, and then returns to Natalia, even though she has not answered his letters from abroad. Although interesting and similar in content and intent to the works of Graham Greene, the plot line of Natalie Natalia can be construed as \\"difficult to follow\\" because the linear narration is interrupted by segments where Greville's thoughts, dreams, and fantasies become the focus of the prose. An example of such an interruptive/introspective segment in Greville's POV (from Chapter 7) follows : > [‚Ä¶] I had rowed into the harbour from the sea; the oars had made whirlpools. > A light appeared in the window: your breast, above the candle, burned. We > wrapped our cloaks round us: ran with our shoulders against the drawbridge. > Hands came through the door and held us; they were tendrils through the > stone. You watched from an upstairs window. We were in the hallway of the > castle. You stood with the candle and one hand against your breast. The > candle burned: it made blood against the snow. The man with the beak of a > bird put his head down to embrace you: with one arm round his neck, you were > a tunnel through which he could breathe. On the stairs were figures in suits > of armour.

Vedran Smailoviƒá (born 11 November 1956), known as the \\"Cellist of Sarajevo\\", is a musician from Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the siege of Sarajevo, he played Albinoni's Adagio in G Minor in ruined buildings, and, often under the threat of snipers, he played during funerals. His bravery inspired musical numbers and a novel. He moved to Northern Ireland and is a composer, conductor, and performer. His G minor masterpiece was introduced in a book called \\"a story like the wind\\". Background He played in the Sarajevo Opera, the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra, The Symphony Orchestra RTV Sarajevo, and the National Theatre of Sarajevo. The Cellist of Sarajevo Smailoviƒá caught the imagination of people around the world by playing his cello, most notably performing Albinoni's Adagio in G Minor for twenty two days, in the ruined square of a downtown Sarajevo marketplace after a mortar round had killed twenty-two people waiting for food there. He managed to leave Sarajevo 1993, in the second year of the siege that lasted from 5 April 1992 to 29 February 1996 (1,425 days) and is often mistakenly identified as a member of the Sarajevo String Quartet, which played on throughout the siege. In his honour, composer David Wilde wrote a piece for solo cello, The Cellist of Sarajevo, which was recorded by Yo Yo Ma. Paul O'Neill described Smailoviƒá's performances as the inspiration for Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24 by Savatage and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Folk singer John McCutcheon also penned a song in his honour, In the Streets of Sarajevo. The South African singer and songwriter Coenie de Villiers wrote a song in Afrikaans, called Die tjeiis van Sarajevo (The cellist of Sarajevo), which was included in his 2011 album Hart van glas (Heart of glass). Canadian author Elizabeth Wellburn worked with Smailoviƒá to create the children's book Echoes from the Square (1998). Another Canadian author, Steven Galloway, based a character on Smailoviƒá in his bestselling 2008 novel, The Cellist of Sarajevo. In the book, an unnamed cellist plays every day at 4:00 pm for 22 days, always at the same time and location, to honour the 22 people killed by a mortar bomb while they queued for bread on May 26, 1992. The account, including the time of the mortar attack, is fictional. Smailoviƒá publicly expressed outrage over the book's publication. He said, \\"They steal my name and identity,\\" and added that he expected damages, an apology and compensation. In 2012, a meeting between Smailoviƒá and Galloway took place during which the latter assured he meant no harm in telling a fictional representation of the events. Continued career He escaped the city in late 1993 and has since been involved in numerous music projects as a performer, composer and conductor. He now lives in Warrenpoint, Northern Ireland. He was named a Hero's hero by The My Hero Project.

After 1980, industrial splintered into a range of offshoots, sometimes collectively named post-industrial music.Partridge, Christopher; Moberg, Marcus: Industrial, Post-industrial and Neofolk music, The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music, Bloomsbury Academic 2017, , p. 206 \\"From the early 1980s onwards industrial music as represented by Throbbing Gristle influenced and was fused with other musical styles, resulting in what can be termed 'post-industrial styles'.\\" This list details some of these offshoots, including fusions with other experimental and electronic music genres as well as rock, folk, heavy metal and hip hop. Industrial genres have spread worldwide and are particularly well represented in North America, Europe, and Japan. Industrial music Industrial music comprises many styles of experimental music, including many forms of electronic music. The term was coined in the mid-1970s for Industrial Records artists. The first industrial artists experimented with noise and controversial topics. Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, Boyd Rice, SPK, and Z'EV. Test Dept, Clock DVA, Nocturnal Emissions, Whitehouse, Laibach, and The Leather Nun subsequently participated in the movement. German group Einst√ºrzende Neubauten forged their own style, which mixed metal percussion, guitars and unconventional instruments (such as jackhammers and bones) in stage performances that often damaged the venues in which they played. Post-industrial developments =Dark ambient= Dark ambient projects like Coil, Lilith, Nurse with Wound, Lustmord, and Zoviet France, evolved out of industrial music during the 1980s. These artists make use of non-musical material and noise, but less abrasively than other post-industrial musicians, bordering more on ambient music. The last material that Throbbing Gristle recorded in the studio, In the Shadow of the Sun and Journey Through a Body, was ambient, and pointed in the direction that TG's offshoots (notably Coil, Chris & Cosey) would take. Other artists include Long Distance Poison, Hafler Trio, MRT, Kim Cascone, Controlled Bleeding, Nine Inch Nails (on their album Ghosts I-IV), early Techno Animal, prominent game music composer Akira Yamaoka, Robin Rimbaud, Final and Deutsch Nepal. Nivek Ogre of Skinny Puppy, an electro-industrial group. =Electro- industrial= Electro-Industrial draws on EBM, and developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, and Wumpscut. In the mid-'90s, the style spawned the dark electro and aggrotech offshoots. Other artists include Haujobb, Lab Report, and Le√¶ther Strip. =Electronic body music= Electronic body music combines elements of European industrial,Nancy Kilpatrick. The Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2004, , p. 85-86. German electronic music such as that of Klaus Schulze, music of the Neue Deutsche Welle electropunk scene.Hillegonda C Rietveld (1998) This Is Our House: House Music, Cultural Spaces and Technologies Aldershot: Ashgate. It first came to prominence in Belgium. The name was coined by Ralf H√ºtter of Kraftwerk in 1978 to explain the more physical sound of their album The Man- Machine. The term was later used in its current sense by Belgian group Front 242 in 1984 to describe their EP No Comment, released in the same year. It denotes a certain type of danceable electronic music, a mixture of electropunk and industrial music. Other artists include Armageddon Dildos, Die Krupps, √†;GRUMH..., A Split-Second, And One, Bigod 20, The Neon Judgement, and Attrition. =Industrial hip hop= Industrial hip hop fuses the themes and aesthetics of industrial with hip hop music. Its origins are in the work of Mark Stewart and Adrian Sherwood. In 1985, Stewart, former Pop Group singer, released As the Veneer of Democracy Starts to Fade, applying the cut-up style of industrial music with the house band of Sugar Hill Records (Doug Wimbish, Keith Leblanc, and Skip McDonald). Sherwood was a major figure in British dub music, as well as working with industrial groups such as Cabaret Voltaire, Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, Ministry, KMFDM, and Nine Inch Nails. Tackhead, a collaboration between Sherwood and the Sugar Hill band, picked up where Stewart left off. The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, from San Francisco, and Meat Beat Manifesto, from the UK, are also early representatives of the style. The later work of Broadrick's Godflesh, as well as his collaborations with Kevin Martin, Ice, and Techno Animal, are examples of industrial hip hop. Saul Williams, a slam poet, also performs in the style. Other notable contributors include CX KidtroniK, clipping., B L A C K I E, Death Grips, JPEGMafia, D√§lek, and Electric Caves. Al Jourgensen with Revolting Cocks, an industrial rock group =Industrial rock= Industrial rock artists generally employ the basic rock instrumentation of electric guitars, drums and bass and pair it with white noise blasts, electronic music gear (synthesizers, sequencers, samplers and drum machines). Guitars are commonly heavily distorted or otherwise effected. Bass guitars and drums may be played live, or be replaced by electronic musical instruments or computers. The early fusions of industrial music and rock were practiced by a handful of post-punk groups, including Chrome, Killing Joke, Swans, Big Black, and Foetus. Nine Inch Nails popularized industrial rock in the US with the release of Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral. Industrial metal evolved from the scene, and is practiced by groups such as Ministry, Godflesh, and Fear Factory. Merzbow, prominent Japanoise musician, in 2007 =Japanoise= Japanoise (a blend of the words \\"Japanese\\" and \\"noise\\") is the noise music scene of Japan. Popular and active in the 1980s and 1990s but continuing into the early 21st century, the Japanoise scene is defined by its sense of musical freedom: Groups range from the punk demolition of Hanatarash and its subsequent psychedelic Boredoms evolutions, to the tabletop electronics of Incapacitants and Merzbow. The scene was initially inspired by power electronics and sometimes deals with BDSM themes. Nonetheless, Japanoise is often less serious than other post- industrial styles, and some musicians, such as Aube, are also inspired by psychedelia or space rock. =Neofolk= The apocalyptic folk group Current 93 in 2007 Neofolk is the music of artists like Douglas Pearce of Death In June, Tony Wakeford of Sol Invictus, and David Tibet of Current 93, who had collaborated with one another. Access date: March 17, 2009. These musicians comprised a post-industrial music circle who incorporated folk music based on traditional European elements. Neofolk can be solely acoustic folk music or a blend of acoustic folk instrumentation with accompanying sounds, such as pianos, strings or elements of industrial music and experimental music. The genre encompasses an assortment of themes including traditional music, heathenry, romanticism and occultism. Neofolk musicians often have ties to other genres such as martial industrial. Apocalyptic folk predates neofolk and was used by David Tibet for the music of his band Current 93 during the late 1980s. Initially, Tibet did not intend to imply connection with the folk music genre; rather, that Current 93's music was made by \\"apocalyptic folk, or guys.\\" Whitehouse, the founders of power electronics =Power electronics= Power electronics was originally coined by William Bennett for the noise music of his own project Whitehouse. It consists of screeching waves of feedback, analogue synthesizers making sub-bass pulses or high frequency squealing sounds, and screamed, distorted, often hateful and offensive lyrics. Deeply atonal, there are no conventional melodies or rhythms. Members of Whitehouse who began other projects, such as Sutcliffe J√ºgend, also practice power electronics. Death industrial is a similar style associated with groups such as The Grey Wolves, but the term first referred to artists such as Brighter Death Now. Access date: March 17, 2009. The Swedish label Cold Meat Industry issued the releases in this subgenre. =Power noise= Power noise (also known as rhythmic noise) takes its inspiration from some of the more structured and distorted early industrial acts, such as Esplendor Geom√©trico. The Belgian group Dive also anticipated the style in the early '90s. Power noise groups meld noise music with various forms of electronic dance music. The term \\"power noise\\" was coined by Raoul Roucka of Noisex in 1997, with the track \\"United (Power Noise Movement)\\".Vlad McNeally, review of Noisex, ReGen Magazine, November 29, 2007. Access date: August 8, 2008. Typically, power noise is based upon a distorted kick drum from a drum machine such as a Roland TR-909, uses militaristic 4/4 beats, and is usually instrumental. Sometimes a melodic component is added, but this is almost always secondary to the rhythm. Power noise tracks are typically structured and danceable, but are occasionally abstract. This genre is showcased at the annual Maschinenfest festival in Krefeld, Germany, as well as at Infest in Bradford, UK. Other artists include Imminent Starvation, Axiome, Converter, and Terrorfakt. The German labels Ant-Zen and Hands Productions specialize in the style. Technoid grew out of the scene, taking inspiration from IDM, experimental techno and noise music. German label Hymen Records is responsible for the term and the style. Artists include Gridlock, Black Lung, Revolution State, and Xingu Hill. =Witch house= Witch house is a debated term referring to a fusion genre of electronic music that features a prominent hip-hop influence, specifically the 1990s Houston chopped and screwed sound pioneered by DJ Screw. Witch house consists of applying techniques rooted in Swishahouse hip-hop ‚Äì drastically slowed tempos with skipping, stop-timed beats ‚Äì with signifiers of noise, drone, or shoegaze, the genre recontextualizes its forebears into a sinister, unprecedented, yet aesthetically referential atmosphere. Witch house is also influenced by hazy 1980s goth bands, including Cocteau Twins, The Cure and Dead Can Dance, as well as being heavily influenced by certain early industrial bands. The use of hip-hop drum machines, noise atmospherics, creepy samples, synthpop-influenced lead melodies, and heavily altered or distorted vocals is also common. Nine Inch Nails live on tour in 2005 Sales The best-selling offshoots of industrial music are industrial rock and metal; Ministry and Nine Inch Nails both recorded platinum-selling albums. Their success led to an increase in commercial success for some other post- industrial musicians; the Nine Inch Nails remix album Further Down the Spiral, for example, which included contributions from Foetus and Coil, was certified gold in 1996.

In it, Mamet discusses the conscious and unconscious processes that go on in developing a work of art. The essay, dedicated to Michael Feingold (a critic of The Village Voice), is divided in three chapters: \\"The Wind-Chill Factor\\", \\"Second Act Problems\\", and \\"Three Uses of the Knife\\". Mamet begins his book by saying that people naturally dramatize everyday occurrences and that life itself is inherently theatrical: \\"Our survival mechanism orders the world into cause-effect-conclusion.\\" He goes on to explain that the ways in which we dramatize our everyday experiences are not different than 'true drama', particularly tragedy, which‚Äîalong with myth and religion‚Äî creates awe within the audience. True drama enables the spectator to achieve peace by realizing the fact that he or she is powerless to affect the natural order. The book's title stems from a quote from musician Lead Belly, appearing on page 66: *Huddie Ledbetter, also known as Leadbelly, said: You take a knife, you use it to cut the bread, so you'll have strength to work; you use it to shave, so you'll look nice for your lover; on discovering her with another, you use it to cut out her lying heart.

It is sometimes referred to as the Alto Douro (upper Douro), as it is located some distance upstream from Porto, sheltered by mountain ranges from coastal influence. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denomina√ß√£o de Origem Controlada (DOC). While the region is associated primarily with Port wine production, the Douro produces just as much table wine (non-fortified wines) as it does fortified wine. The non-fortified wines are typically referred to as \\"Douro wines\\". Alto Douro was one of the 13 regions of continental Portugal identified by geographer Amorim Gir√£o, in a study published between 1927 and 1930. Together with Tr√°s-os-Montes it became Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. The style of wines produced in the Douro range from light, Bordeaux-style claret to rich Burgundian-style wines aged in new oak.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 331 Dorling Kindersley 2005 History There is archaeological evidence for winemaking in the region dating from the end of the Western Roman Empire, during the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, although grape seeds have also been found at older archaeological sites.UNESCO: Alto Douro (Portugal) No 1046 (Documentation for World Heritage application) In Medieval times from the mid-12th century, Cistercians had an important influence on winemaking in the region, through their three monasteries Salzedas, S√£o Jo√£o de Tarouca and S√£o Pedro das √Åguias. In the 17th century, the region's vineyards expanded, and the earliest known mention of \\"Port wine\\" dates from 1675. The Methuen Treaty between Portugal and England in 1703, and the subsequent establishment of many British Port lodges in Porto meant that Port wine became the primary product of the region, and it became economically very important to Portugal. As part of the regulation of the production and trade of this valuable commodity, a royal Portuguese charter of 10 September 1756 defined the production region for Port wine. It thus became the world's first wine region to have a formal demarcation. The vineyards covered by this demarcation were situated in the western part of the present region. Later, the vineyards have progressively expanded to the east into hotter and drier areas. Douro was not spared from the vine diseases of the 19th century. Powdery mildew (oidium) struck in 1852 and Phylloxera in 1863. While table wine has always been produced in the region, for a long time little of it was seen outside the region itself. The Port lodges were focused on the production and export of Port wine, which was their unique product on the export market, and had little interest in other wine styles. Thus, while the wines could be good, for a long time, there was no attempt to use Douro grapes to produce more ambitious table wine. The person credited with creating the first ambitious Douro wine is Fernando Nicolau de Almeida, who worked as an oenologist with the Port house Ferreira. He visited Bordeaux during World War II, which gave him inspiration for creating a top-quality table wine. The wine Barca Velha, first produced in 1952 using grapes from Quinta do Vale de Me√£o situated in the Douro Superior subregion, was the result.Wine Anorak: The Douro wine revolution Barca Velha didn't immediately get many followers, since most Port wine houses remained uninterested in non-fortified wines for a long time. A few more ambitious Douro wines made their appearance from the 1970s, but it was not until the 1990s when a large number of wines made their appearance. A contributing factor was Portugal's entry into the European Economic Community in 1986, which meant that the Port lodges' monopoly was abolished,Wine Access: Portugal‚Äôs dry wine revolution thus paving the way for producers in the Douro valley to produce and bottle their own wine - Port or dry Douro wines. At this stage, several Port houses also introduced Douro wines into their range. The Douro winemaking region was declared a World Heritage Site in 2001.UNESCO World Heritage List: Alto Douro Wine Region Geography and climate The Douro wine region is situated around the Douro river valley and lower vallies of its tributaries Varosa, Corgo, T√°vora, Torto, and Pinh√£o. The region is sheltered from Atlantic winds by the Mar√£o and Montemuro mountains and has a continental climate, with hot and dry summers and cold winters. It is usually subdivided into three subregions, from the west to the east:Wine Anorak: The Douro wine revolution Part 1: Overview * Baixo Corgo (\\"below Corgo\\"), a subregion with the mildest climate and most precipitation. It has of vineyards. Although it is the subregion which was planted first, in general, it is considered to give wines of lesser quality than the other two subregions. * Cima Corgo (\\"above Corgo\\") is the largest subregion with of vineyards, centered on the village of Pinh√£o, and where the majority of the famous Quintas are located. * Douro Superior (\\"upper Douro\\"Not to be confused with Alto Douro, which refers to the wine region as a whole although both may be translated into English as \\"upper Douro\\".) is the hottest and driest of the subregions, and stretches all the way to the Spanish border. It has of vineyards and is the source of many wines of very good quality. As it is the least accessible of the three subregions, it is the most recently planted, and it is still expanding. Terraced vineyards are very common in the Douro region. Vineyards dedicated to Port production are usually planted on schist while areas with granite-based soils are used for table wine production. Grapes The principal grape varieties of the Douro region include the black grapes Bastardo, Mourisco tinto, Tinta Amarela, Tinta Barroca, Tinta C√£o, Tinta Roriz (the same as Spain's Tempranillo), Touriga Francesa and Touriga Nacional, and the white grapes Donzelinho branco, Gouveio, Malvasia Fina, Rabigato, and Viosinho. A large number of grape varieties are grown in the Douro region, most of them local Portuguese grapes. For a long time, the grape varieties grown in the Douro were not very well studied. Vineyards of mixed plantation were the norm, and most of the time, the vineyard owners didn't know which grape varieties they were growing. A pioneering effort were made in the 1970s which identified Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Touriga Franca, Tinta C√£o and Tinta Barroca as the prime dark- skinned grape varieties. Tinta Amarela and the teinturier Sous√£o has later come to be included among the varieties that attract the most interest. This work was important for creating the new wave of top Douro wines and has also led to a greater focus on the grape varieties that go into Port wine. Most top quintas now replant with single-variety vineyards and focus on a limited number of varieties, but older, mixed vineyards will remain in production for many decades to come.

It is one of the oldest established wine regions in Portugal. D√£o wine is produced in a mountainous region with a temperate climate, in the area of the Rio Mondego and D√£o rivers in the north central region of Portugal.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pp. 204‚Äì205 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The region became a Denomina√ß√£o de Origem Controlada (DOC) appellation in 1990. The D√£o region is the origin of the Touriga Nacional vine that is the principal component of port wine.J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition p. 223 Oxford University Press 2006 Climate and geography The wine region is located primarily on a plateau that is sheltered on three sides by the granite mountain ranges of Serra da Estrela, Serra do Caramulo and Serra da Nave. This helps the area maintain its temperate climate away from the effects of the nearby Atlantic Ocean. The region experiences abundant rainfall in the winter months and long, warm dry summers leading up to harvest. The region's vineyards are planted on sandy well-drained soil on top of granite rock. History The first efforts to have the D√£o region recognized as a separate and unique wine region came mainly from the aristocrat and winemaker Jo√£o de Sacadura Botte C√¥rte-Real. Considered to be \\"the most enlightened viticulturist of his generation\\", he modernized the processes of winemaking and raised the standards of the wine produced in the region. He had many wine estates, in both Portugal and Spain, but the most celebrated were his Quinta da Aguieira and his wife's Quinta da Bica. The D√£o was first officially recognized as a Regi√£o Demarcada in 1908. In the 1940s, to improve the quality of the wine from the region and promote some sort of national identity, the government of Prime Minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar instituted new regulations establishing the mandatory use of co-operatives in the region. These co-operatives would have exclusive privilege to the grapes grown in the region and were charged with making the wine that would be sold to private merchants. Despite its intent, the regulations had an adverse effect on the D√£o wine region by promoting stagnation due to lack of competition, with some co-operative firms releasing inferior quality wine and even practicing un- hygienic winemaking. In 1979, Portugal's application to the European Union prompted authorities to overturn these rules, as the EU discouraged monopolistic practices in the wine industry. Viticulture and wines A glass of D√£o wine made from Jaen, Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz The area is home to several dozen varieties of indigenous grapes, with the majority of wine production being made from the Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Jaen, Alfrocheiro Preto and Encruzado. 80% of the region's production is in red wines, with DOC regulations stipulating that at least 20% of the production must be from Touriga Nacional. Some of the top reserve wine may carry the designation D√£o nobre (meaning noble D√£o).K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 508 Workman Publishing 2001 Another reserve designation, Garrafeira, requires wines to be 0.5% higher in alcohol content then the 12.5% minimum and to spend at least two years in aging in oak. The maximum yield for red wine grapes is 70 hl/ha.P. Saunders Wine Label Language p. 250 Firefly Books 2004 The red wines tend to be very tannic due to prolonged periods of maceration during winemaking. Many producers make liberal use of French and Portuguese oak. The style has been improving, with some producers concentrating on making more fruit-forward styles with smoother tannins. Historically, the white wines were known for being over-oxidized and full-bodied, but more modern winemaking has been producing white wines that are fresh, fruity and fragrant. The Encruzado is the principal grape of the area's whites, with some blends of Malvasia Fina and Bical. Garrafeira white wines require at least 0.5% more alcohol by volume than the 11.5% DOC minimum and at least 6 months aging in oak. The maximum allowable yields for white wine grapes is 80 hl/ha.

Retrieved on 7 January 2009. () is a 1969 French crime thriller film directed by Claude Chabrol. The film had a total of 682,295 admissions in France. Plot Insurer Charles Desvall√©es lives in a beautiful house in the countryside near Paris with his wife H√©l√®ne and their young son. He works in the city in a leisurely job, often drinking and smoking. His wife often goes to Paris for shopping, beauty treatments and cinema sessions. By accident he discovers she was not at the hairdresser when she was meant to be. He gradually grows more suspicious about the way she employs her time and asks a private investigator to follow her. The embarrassed detective duly reports that his wife sees a writer called Victor P√©gala, at his home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, several times a week. H√©l√®ne appears in bed with P√©gala, exchanging titbits about their respective lives. The writer is divorced with two children. On a day his wife is busy hosting a birthday party for their son, Desvall√©es pays P√©gala a visit. At first he tells the confused writer jovially that he and his wife have an open marriage and sits and talks pleasantly with him. He asks for a tour of the small flat. On seeing the bed his demeanour changes, as he pictures his wife there. He spots a giant cigarette lighter at the bedside. This had been a 3rd anniversary present to his wife from him. He starts to feel unwell and suddenly grabs a stone bust and kills P√©gala with a violent blow to the head. Desvall√©e calms down and meticulously cleans up and removes all fingerprints. He then brings his car round near the back gate, bundles up the body, and drags it in broad daylight but in a quiet neighbourhood to the car, where he stuffs it in the boot. En route he is rear-ended by a van after braking distractedly. Desvall√©e nearly panics and hurries the formalities with the other driver as a crowd assembles and a policeman remarks that his boot is now jammed. He dumps the body into a murky pond where it takes an agonisingly long time to sink. A day or two later, H√©l√®ne is grumpy and unwell. Two detectives turn up in the daytime to interrogate her about Victor P√©gala, who has been reported missing by his ex-wife. They have found her name and details in the missing man's address book. She is flustered and avoids giving direct answers as to how she knew Victor. In the evening, she mentions the disappearance to her husband, claiming P√©gala was only a vague acquaintance. The detectives return and interrogate both H√©l√®ne and Charles, who denies having even heard of the man before. H√©l√®ne finds a photograph of Victor in her husband's jacket pocket with his name and address on the back. She looks as if she is going to confront him but she goes outside and burns it. Her emotions are difficult to read. In the final scene the family is in their garden when the two policemen walk up the drive. Charles tells H√©l√®ne that he \\"loves her madly\\" and goes to speak to the police. The camera then moves back to the wife and child, slowly panning until they disappear hidden by soft focus foliage as Charles is presumably taken away from them.

The New York Times said that \\"in concept and execution, it is a film so calmly and thoughtfully perverse that it can have been born only in the unique cinematic imagination of Claude Chabrol.\\" Time Out called it \\"one of Chabrol's mid-period masterpieces, a brilliantly ambivalent scrutiny of bourgeois marriage and murder.\\" Derek Malcolm wrote in The Guardian that \\"Chabrol displays an irrestistible logic and an ironic humour\\", and \\"what could have been just another thriller becomes... also a passionate love story, with its share of intense irony and a pervading sense of the quirkiness of fate.\\" TV Guide called it \\"arguably the best of Chabrol's superb, Hitchcockian studies of guilt, love, and murder among the French elite\\", and said that \\"Michel Bouquet and St√©phane Audran... give perhaps the finest performances of their careers.\\" Remakes It was remade in Filipino in 1995 as Sa ngalan ng pag-ibig and in English in 2002 as Unfaithful, directed by Adrian Lyne.

Cook (1840/1842 Year of birth variously given as 1840 and 1842.- April 2, 1907) was an American western lawman and City Marshal of Denver, Colorado, responsible for over 3,000 arrests. Biography =Early years= Cook was born near La Porte, Indiana. Growing up, he worked as a farmhand before moving to Kansas in 1855, and then in 1859 to Gilpin County, Colorado, looking to prospect for gold. =Military and law enforcement career= In 1861 he joined the Colorado Cavalry upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, and was later assigned to counterespionage for the Union Army, tracking Confederate spies, investigating gold smuggling and similar crimes. His success led him to found the \\"Rocky Mountain Detective Association\\", a freelance, volunteer-only group of Colorado troubleshooters, similar in character to the Pinkerton Detective Agency. Although its offices were in Denver, its cases took him all over the west. From 1866 to 1869, Cook served as marshal of Denver, as well as acting as a federal marshal and range detective. In 1868 Cook tracked down the notorious Musgrove-Franklin Gang, who were credited with twelve murders, and apprehended gang leader L. H. Musgrove in the Wyoming Territory. Having subsequently transported Musgrove to jail in Denver, Cook cleverly predicted his partner Ed Franklin would attempt a rescue. Upon Franklin's arrival into Denver, Cook tracked him to a room in the Overland Hotel. Franklin reportedly reached for a pistol and Cook shot him to death. In 1878, Cook helped quell a major revolt of the Ute tribe in Colorado. In 1880, he served as the arbitrator in a silver mine strike at Leadville, Colorado. =Memoir= In 1882 Cook published a memoir titled Hands Up! or Thirty-five Years of Detective Work in the Mountains and on the Plains, either writing it himself or dictating it to another.

The manner of his execution is frequently cited by opponents of capital punishment in the United States. Evans was born in Beaumont, Texas and died in Atmore, Alabama at the age of 33.  Conviction and sentencing  After his 1976 parole from an Indiana prison, Evans and fellow convict Wayne Ritter (January 30, 1954 - August 28, 1987) embarked on a two-month-long crime spree involving, by Evans's own admission, over thirty armed robberies, nine kidnappings, and two extortion schemes across seven states. On January 5, 1977 he and Ritter robbed and killed Edward Nassar, a pawn shop owner in Mobile, Alabama, while his two young daughters were in the store. The perpetrators fled, but were captured on March 7 by FBI agents in Little Rock, Arkansas. Among the evidence recovered was the gun used to shoot Nassar in the back, and another gun stolen from the pawn shop. Although he gave a detailed confession, prosecutors refused to accept his plea of guilty because they wanted Evans sentenced to death, and under Alabama law, this is only allowed following a conviction by a jury. Evans was tried in State Circuit Court in Mobile, Alabama on April 26, 1977 for first-degree murder committed during commission of a robbery. During the trial, Evans again admitted to his crime and stated that he did not feel remorse and that under the same circumstances he would kill again. Furthermore, he threatened that if the jury did not sentence him to death, he would escape and murder each of them. Despite his testimony, the jury was instructed to consider all the evidence and to return a verdict of guilty only if the prosecutors had left no reasonable doubt. The jury convicted Evans of the capital offense charged, thus imposing the death penalty, after less than fifteen minutes of deliberation. Under Alabama law, all capital sentences must by affirmed by review in higher court. The sentence of death was confirmed by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and by the Alabama Supreme Court, which set the date of April 6, 1979 for his execution. On April 2, Evans' mother Betty, acting as \\"next friend\\", petitioned the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama for a writ of habeas corpus. The application requested the Court to find Evans's conviction to be unconstitutional because consideration of lesser included offenses was not offered the jury. The District Court dismissed her application on the grounds that she was not entitled to act as \\"next friend\\". She appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which overturned the District Court's decision and, in fact, judged the initial criminal conviction to be invalid. In 1982, the Supreme Court of the United States granted the state's petition for a writ of certiorari, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and returning to them the decision on the constitutionality of Evans's sentence. This finding was made with two of the justices (William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall) entering an opinion \\"concurring in part and dissenting in part,\\" because they accepted the argument of the State of Alabama on the matter in question, but held that capital punishment itself was \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\", prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. In July of that year, Evans fired his lawyers and filed a motion to dismiss all further appeals. The Court of Appeals accepted his motion on October 19, 1982. A subsequent application for a new sentencing hearing was rejected by the Alabama Supreme Court on February 18, 1983 and execution was carried out at Holman Prison, near Atmore, Alabama, on April 22.  Execution  The execution is notable for its imprecision. The means of carrying out the sentence of death used at Holman Prison was an electric chair constructed by an inmate in 1927. The chair was nicknamed \\"Yellow Mama\\" because of its traffic-yellow coat of paint. It had not been used since 1965, after which a series of Supreme Court decisions created an effective moratorium on executions in the United States until the constitutionality of the death penalty was affirmed by the Court in Gregg v. Georgia (1976). The execution was witnessed by reporter Mark Harris, who wrote this first-person account for United Press International published on May 4, 1983. The following description of Evans' electrocution was sworn by Evans' attorney, Russell F. Canan, on June 22, 1983: Shortly before his execution, Evans was featured in an After School Special called \\"Dead Wrong\\" in which he shared his life story with young people and pleaded for them not to make the mistakes he did that led to the electric chair. The program makes no reference to the multiple shocks required to end Evans' life. Evans' accomplice, Wayne Ritter, was electrocuted on August 28, 1987.

Morgan's official website and interviews suggest that Woken Furies could be the last Kovacs novel, although in 2018 (before Netflix cancelled the show) Morgan stated that the Netflix adaptation has \\"kind of woken it all up again\\" after all these years, making him possibly reconsider being done with Kovacs. Plot Takeshi Kovacs finds himself in a new \\"sleeve,\\" or human body, back on his home planet of Harlan's World. He is on the run after making numerous attacks against the Knights of the New Revelation, an extremist religious order responsible for the death of his lost love and her daughter. Because she had violated tenets about resleeving, her executioners dropped her and her daughter's cortical stacks in the sea, effectively preventing them from being resleeved (into new bodies).

Harlan's World is surrounded by automated \\"orbitals\\" which target flying objects, such as vehicles, with high-energy beam weapons known as \\"angelfire;\\" Falconer is believed to have died without a backup of her cortical stack when her getaway aircraft was destroyed by angelfire 300 years prior. When Sylvie's crew returns from New Hok, they discover a younger version of Kovacs has been illegally duplicated into a different body (AKA \\"double sleeved\\") and is hunting them on behalf of the Harlan family that rules the planet. Most of Sylvie's crew is killed and Sylvie/Quellcrist is captured. Kovacs schemes to rescue Sylvie by approaching old criminal associates of his, the Little Blue Bugs. The Little Blue Bugs mount a semi- successful attack on a Harlan fortress and rescue Sylvie/Quellcrist. Hiding from Harlan forces in a floating base, the neo-Quellists are sold out by its owner and recaptured. An assault by Kovacs and a single UN Envoy on the base ends badly when Kovacs is betrayed by the Envoy who was actually embedded with several colleagues. However, Sylvie/Quellcrist has established a connection with the orbitals and calls down angelfire, eliminating their captors. The younger Kovacs is killed in the aftermath. Sylvie explains that angelfire is a destructive recording device. Thus, in destroying Quellcrist and the helicopter carrying her, it copied her. When the technology of the deCom crews advanced far enough, her persona was able to insert itself into Sylvie's implants and co-exist in her body. The novel ends with Kovacs, Virginia Vidaura, and Sylvie/Quellcrist waiting to see if they can use Sylvie/Quellcrist's newfound connection to the orbitals and the expansion of a long-dormant genetic virus to turn the population against the ruling oligarchy.

He appears in the films Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II and Ghostbusters: Afterlife and in the animated television series The Real Ghostbusters. In both live action films, he was portrayed by Bill Murray, and was voiced in the animated series first by Lorenzo Music and then by Dave Coulier. He is a parapsychologist and the leader of the Ghostbusters. In 2008, Peter Venkman was selected by the magazine Empire as one of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, described by Empire's Nick de Semlyen as \\"the ultimate New York hero: cynical, sarcastic, secretly sweet-natured\\", \\"a man possessed by manic spontaneity, with a wont to twirl in circles around a public concourse or declare undying love for a woman he's just met\\", and the \\"most popular\\" character played by Murray.  Character  Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Peter Venkman is one of three doctors of parapsychology on the Ghostbusters team. He holds Ph.D.s in both parapsychology and psychology. Originally his professional interests were focused on paranormal phenomena like ESP; he appeared not to believe in ghosts until he actually saw one. In the movies, he is characterized by his flippant persona, his approach to his profession as a scientific charlatan, and his womanizing demeanor. Fred Pfeil sees in him a postmodern hero, whose level of \\"crass self-interest\\" safeguards him from being ensnared by a stereotypical role. Despite Peter's lackadaisical attitude, from time to time he has created inventions that help the Ghostbusters save the day, and he is shrewd and more street-smart than either Ray Stantz or Egon Spengler. Peter serves as the front man for the group and possesses more social ability than the more academically inclined Ray and Egon. For instance, he is the one who is able to persuade the city mayor to release them after being arrested, return their equipment and otherwise support their attempt to stop Gozer.  Appearances  = Film =  Ghostbusters (1984)  Peter Venkman was a professor working with Egon Spengler and Ray Stantz at Columbia University. The trio were researching the supernatural but, unlike his partners, Peter was not as enthusiastic about the topic. Despite having a passing interest in ESP, he appears not to have believed in ghosts until witnessing one personally. The team of three discovered the librarian ghost, but were unable to catch and show her off to the public. Subsequently, their funding was cut and they were fired from their university positions, though Peter seemed happy to look for new opportunities. After being fired, the three of them decided to build some advanced paranormal equipment and go into a career of freelance ghost catching. Peter encouraged and prodded Ray to mortgage his house in order to find the capital needed to purchase the firehouse. Whether motivated by the prospect of becoming rich or just the fact that he no longer had to work under the thumb of the board of regents, Dr. Venkman was very motivated to begin a new career. Peter soon became the first to meet the company's first client, Dana Barrett, and formed a romantic interest. Dana had claimed that there were monsters in her fridge even though Peter could not find any such thing. After that incident, Peter, Egon, and Ray were eating dinner at the firehouse when their secretary Janine got a call. Peter and his team came to the Sedgewick Hotel, where Peter came face to face with the ghost that would one day become known as Slimer. Peter was slimed during his first encounter with the ghost, which Ray greatly praised as \\"actual physical contact.\\" Peter and his team eventually captured the ghost, which soon made them popular and busy around town with other ghosts. Peter had stopped by at one of her orchestra rehearsals. He happened upon her talking to a colleague who played in the orchestra with her that was interested her as well. He asked her, \\"Who's the stiff?\\" She answers, \\"The stiff happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world.\\" Peter has found some answers for Dana, but say they can find out more on another night. Peter continues to compliment and flirt in confidence and Dana reluctantly says trying to keep down commotion, \\"I'll see you Thursday.\\" He says, \\"We'll eat and read.\\" As she walks away with her male colleague, he addresses her somewhat jealously, \\"So, who the hell is that?!\\" and Dana replies, \\"A friend. An old friend.\\" She counted smile because of Peter constant compliments towards her appearance which now he was stating in front of her male colleague. Not too long afterwards, Janine is overrun with calls and stressed out. She tells Peter there is a man waiting in his office from the EPA and she has been working two weeks without a break and states that he promised he would hire more help. He sarcastically praises her experiences in order to let her know the door is open to discover more opportunities if she was unsatisfied with her present one working for him. As the phone is ringing once more, Peter replies to her, \\"Are you going to Answer that?\\". Peter soon met an EPA representative named Walter Peck, who got angry that Peter refused to show him the storage facility. As Peter was coming to see Dana and take her out on a date, he noticed that she had undergone a radical change and was now acting very strangely. She barred entrance to her apartment, asking him if he was \\"The Keymaster\\". After getting the door slammed in his face he tricked her in order to gain entry. Once inside Dana referred to herself as Zuul, \\"The Gatekeeper\\" and told Peter she was awaiting the coming of Gozer, \\"The Destructor\\". Peter replied, \\"Oh...\\" and noticed slime seeping through the kitchen door and furniture. The possessed Dana quickly led Peter to the bedroom where she tried to seduce him asking him \\"Do you want this body?\\" which he rebuked asking if its a trick question. The possessed Dana was unrelenting in her seduction, telling Peter \\"Take me now subcreature.\\" Peter ignored her and Dana slammed him onto her bed, pouncing on him and pinning him to the bed with supernatural might. She passionately kissed him and rolled him over on top of her telling him \\"I want you inside me\\" alas Peter told her she must have two people inside of her already. Peter proceeded to try to talk to the real Dana Barrett, ignoring her seductive advances in the process. While asking for Dana she replied in an inhuman growling voice that \\"There is no Dana, only Zuul\\". Peter gave Zuul to the count of three to leave Dana's body to which she responded by turning her eyes white, thrashing her head back and forth on her bed then growling furiously like a beast at him and levitating above her bed. Peter, realizing the seriousness of Dana's condition, sedated her and called Egon to explain what was going on. He soon learned from Egon that her building was renovated by an evil architect named Ivo Shandor and she was being possessed by Zuul, the Gatekeeper of Gozer. After Peck returned and shut down the Containment Unit, the ghosts all escaped, Peter and the other Ghostbusters were imprisoned for EPA violations. Peter convinced the mayor that an apocalypse of \\"Biblical proportions,\\" was coming to destroy the city. The Ghostbusters were released and toward Dana's building, escorted there by a police and army motorcade as a dark cloud started to cover the entire city. After an earthquake struck, nearly trapping them in rubble, the Ghostbusters made it to the top of the building. However they were too late to stop Dana and Louis Tully from releasing the evil Gozer and transforming into their possessors' Terror Dog forms. The Ghostbusters confronted Gozer, who electrocuted them before being zapped by their proton packs, vanishing and returning in the form of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (which Ray had been thinking of). Peter and his team then crossed their streams and forced the door to Gozer's dimension to close, destroying the Marshmallow Man in a blaze of flames and saving the city. Peter rescued Dana, no longer possessed, from the rubble of Zuul's charred body, finally winning her affections for saving her.  Ghostbusters II (1989)  Despite saving the town from Gozer, the Ghostbusters were put out of business due to being sued for all the damage that was done during the battle. Also, Peter and Dana's relationship faltered due to his fear of commitment and taking her for granted. She left for her male colleague in the orchestra, married him and had a child. He unexpectedly \\"ditched\\" her for an opportunity leaving her and his son behind. In the years since, Egon described Peter (even to Dana) as being borderline(manic) until he eventually, \\"crossed the border.\\" Peter became the host of a psychic reality talk show in the years after the Gozer battle. He and his teammates went to Dana's aid after she claimed her baby stroller rolled away from her by itself, and pinpointed there was \\"something brewing under the street,\\" of First Avenue. Egon, Peter, and Ray start to dig under the surface of the road where Ray is lowered down into the hole where he discovers a River of Slime. The three Ghostbusters were summoned to court, where they stand trial on the grounds of violating a restraining order and destroying a section of First Avenue. They got back into business after the slime sample in the courtroom absorbed the judge's negative energy while shouting and exploded out two ghosts named the Scoleri Brothers. After the judge rescinded the order and dismissed the case(while under duress from the ghosts), the Ghostbusters were allowed to put on their equipment and bust the ghosts, declaring to the public afterwards that they were open for business once again. While his teammates investigate the river of slime underneath the city, Peter renewed his relationship with Dana, whose baby Oscar was being targeted by the ghost of Vigo the Carpathian. Peter and his team in the end defeated Vigo and saved the city once again. Even when paralyzed, Peter's tongue was still as sharp as ever and he still managed to provoke Vigo's ire with a variety of pointed insults, including referring to him as a \\"dumb blond\\".  Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021)  Murray is confirmed by Aykroyd that he will reprise his role as Venkman in Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021). = Television =  The Real Ghostbusters  In The Real Ghostbusters series, Peter's womanizing is toned down somewhat (though he is still quick to approach attractive women), but he retains his quick wit and cynical demeanor, and his arrogance is played up more. While not the official leader of the group, Venkman is the closest thing they have to one, and often makes the decision whether the Ghostbusters will take a case or not. He often reinforces the prospect of Ghostbusters being a business and, with rare exceptions, opposes ghostbusting without the promise of equity. He is originally opposed to the idea of Slimer living in the firehouse, but quickly develops a love‚Äìhate relationship with the ghost; mostly hate whenever he is \\"slimed\\" on an episodic basis. The episodes \\"Venkman's Ghost Repellers\\", \\"Cold Cash and Hot Water\\", and \\"Treasure of the Sierra Tamale\\" feature Peter's father, a con artist/businessman who could not make an honest dollar and was often away on business during Peter's childhood, as mentioned in \\"X-mas Marks The Spot\\". He is depicted as a selfish, even obnoxious father; his relationship with Peter is estranged. Peter has claimed to be a Scorpio, as mentioned in \\"Mean Green Teen Machine\\". In \\"Last Train to Oblivion\\", one of Peter's favorite hobbies is trains, and he used to dream about driving a big locomotive when he was a child (Peter even studied engineering in college for two years before discovering it had nothing to do with trains). Peter Venkman was voiced by Lorenzo Music during the first season. At the start of the second season, Music was replaced by Dave Coulier when Murray complained to the studio that the character sounded too much like Garfield the cat (who was also voiced by Music). Coincidentally, Murray voiced Garfield in the 2004 live-action film and its 2006 sequel.  Extreme Ghostbusters  Peter only appears in the two-part series finale. After the closing down of the Ghostbusters, Peter went to Hollywood and tried to sell an idea for a Ghostbusters movie, but never got it going because he was waiting for Brad Pitt to become available to portray him. The Ghostbusters in Extreme Ghostbusters keep a statue of Peter Venkman, complete with uniform and working original Proton Pack, in the Ghostbusters Firehouse. = Video Games =  Ghostbusters II (NES)  Peter was featured as a playable character in Ghostbusters II for NES.  New Ghostbusters 2  Peter was featured as a playable character in New Ghostbusters 2 for NES and Game Boy.  Ghostbusters: The Video Game  Venkman shows some initial distrust when Ray and Egon hire the Rookie, jealous that he gets issued new equipment and gets a 'title'. However, upon Egon and Ray explaining to Peter that the equipment the Rookie is issued is \\"highly experimental and, if not handled properly, could blow the user clear into New Jersey,\\" Peter immediately lost interest in both the Rookie and his gear. Peter eventually warms up to the Rookie and occasionally praises his developing skills, but his interest is soon lost once they encountered Ilyssa Selwyn who, true to himself, he took an instant liking to. Peter flirted with her, but she was disinterested. At the end, he won her heart and shared a brief kiss with Ilyssa before she was slimed by Slimer. Peter still maintains the smooth-talking slacker identity from the previous two movies, willing to jump at any chance to get out of doing work or going into a dangerous situation. He offers to take Marine Ecto-8 to avoid going onto Shandor Island. These attempts are transparent at best, prompting the other Ghostbusters to roll their eyes or glare at him. Peter is still primarily motivated in his own best interests. He can be goaded into expending effort if an attractive female or a lucrative payoff is involved. But in the end he will still come around to doing the right thing when it's really important.  Beeline's Ghostbusters  Venkman appears in Beeline's Ghostbusters game for iOS. The game was released on January 24, 2013.  Lego Dimensions  Venkman appears as a playable character in Lego Dimensions, with archival audio of Bill Murray being used to represent his character. Out of the four, Venkman is the default Ghostbuster that is selected. Comparison Bruce G. Hallenbeck, author of Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914‚Äì2008, compares Peter Venkman to Groucho Marx, who hosted the 1950s quiz show You Bet Your Life. Hallenback said, \\"With a quip for every situation, a put-down for everyone who deserves it and an ability to rise above it all, Venkman is a lot like Groucho.\\" The comparison is also reinforced by the scene in the original movie where, waiting for Dana Barrett to finish the day's rehearsals with the orchestra Peter jogs up and down a bustling New York square hopping on a single foot, alternately, just as Groucho Marx used to do.

He appears in the films Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989), Casper (1995, as a cameo) and Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), the animated television series The Real Ghostbusters and Extreme Ghostbusters, and the video games Beeline's Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters: The Video Game. He was portrayed by Dan Aykroyd in all four live action films, and voiced by Frank Welker in the animated series. He is a member of the Ghostbusters and one of the three doctors of parapsychology, along with Dr. Peter Venkman and Dr. Egon Spengler.  Character  Ray is an expert on paranormal history and metallurgy. He is characterised by his almost childlike enthusiasm towards his work, and his forthright acceptance of paranormal activity. As a result, Peter once during the movie referred to him as \\"the heart of the Ghostbusters\\". Ray has extensive knowledge of the Bible (to the point of even quoting a specific book and chapter ‚Äì \\"I remember Revelation 7:12\\"‚Äîabout the end of the world, though the passage he quotes is actually Revelation 6:12), but is an agnostic, commenting when asked if he believes in God, \\"Never met Him\\". As revealed in Ghostbusters: The Video Game, Ray attended a seminary at some stage in his life. He is known for his wordy and overly technical explanations of scientific and paranormal phenomena. Ray, along with Egon, is responsible for pioneering the Ghostbusters' theories and designing and building the equipment used for catching and containing ghosts.  Appearances  = Film =  Ghostbusters (1984)  Before being kicked out of the University, Ray was devoting a lot of his workday to interviewing people who had some sort of encounter with the paranormal. After the entanglement with the library ghost, Ray was more motivated to continue on with that type of work. When the guys were let go by Dean Yager, he was initially crushed, primarily concerned with his academic integrity, financial stability, etc. Ray had briefly worked in the private sector beforehand, and knew it was not conducive to his line of work, as they expected results. After talking with Peter Venkman and Egon Spengler, they all decided to try hunting ghosts full-time. Ray even mortgaged the house he was born in to provide the starting capital to get the company started and lease the firehouse. In addition, he rummaged through used car lots to find a suitable vehicle and repair it to make the Ecto-1. Dr. Stantz also has the distinction of being the first Ghostbuster to meet Slimer. Unlike his other continuity, however, Ray dropped his cigarette in fear. He then went proton blasting, after his call for assistance was unheard by Venkman. Ray accidentally chose the form of Gozer's appearance because of his childhood memories at Camp Waconda. Despite his initial attempt at negotiations, he wound up fighting Gozer with his Proton Pack. After reversing the particle flow to force Gozer back into his realm, Ray was concerned about the other guys' welfare after the explosion, and then celebrated with them all afterward. Although this was short-lived by the, \\"ungrateful, yuppie larvae!\\" representing the city, county and state of New York.  Ghostbusters II (1989)  In the second film, following the decline of the Ghostbusters' business, he and Winston were entertainers for parties. When he was not doing that, he was running his bookstore, Ray's Occult Books. However, when Dana Barrett comes to Egon and later Ray, it becomes clear that something supernatural was once again happening underneath New York City. Ray and Egon experiment with the Psychomagnotheric Slime they find and eventually discover a way to not only positively charge the slime, but utilize it to animate the Statue of Liberty in their final assault on Vigo the Carpathian. Ray also briefly becomes the host for Vigo himself, but a liberal dousing of the positively charged mood slime quickly cures him of that.  Casper (1995)  Dan Aykroyd has a cameo appearance as Stantz in Casper. When Carrigan and Dibs are attempting to evict the Ghostly Trio from the McFadden Manor, before contacting Dr. James Harvey, they contact Ray Stantz of the Ghostbusters. After he fails to capture the Ghostly Trio, he runs out of the manor in fear, and says to Carrigan and Dibs: \\"Who you gonna call? Someone else.\\"  Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021)  Aykroyd confirmed that he will reprise his role as Stantz in Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021). = Television =  The Real Ghostbusters  Ray has an extended family (which has different nationalities ranging from Swiss to Scottish to Russian), including his Aunt Lois (who appears in the episode, \\"The Spirit of Aunt Lois\\"), and Uncle Andrew MacMillan of Dunkeld, Scotland (who is mentioned as being deceased in \\"Bustman's Holiday\\"). Ray was born in the Bronx in 1959, according to the episodes Citizen Ghost, and \\"It's About Time\\", then later moved to Morrisville, which appears in Look Homeward Ray. The latter episode also reveals that Ray's childhood crush was a brunette named Elaine. During the show's run he was the closest member of the team to being a pilot, having won a free flying lesson in 1976, as mentioned in You Can't Take It With You. Ray's surname was misspelled in the series as \\"Stanz\\", in much the same way as Winston Zeddemore's surname was misspelled \\"Zeddmore\\". Ray is the only Ghostbuster to wear the original beige jumpsuit uniform in both the animated series and the films, while the other Ghostbusters wore color coded jumpsuits in the animated series ‚Äì brown for Venkman, light blue for Winston and gray- blue for Egon (presumably to help differentiate them better).  Extreme Ghostbusters  Ray appears only in the two-part series finale of Extreme Ghostbusters. After the closing down of the Ghostbusters Ray got a job at a major university. After a \\"minor mishap,\\" followed by a large explosion, he has a job at Perpetual Motors, a used car company. = Video games =  Ghostbusters: The Video Game  A likeness of Aykroyd, circa 1991 (the year in which the game takes place) appears in the Ghostbusters: The Video Game, that was released on June 16, 2009. Aykroyd also reprised his role for the game by voicing him. In the game, Stantz is eager to expand his knowledge in regards to researching the paranormal. More than once he asks the Rookie to collect samples and take readings for later research. Ray is also the most vocally supportive of the Rookie. It is mentioned that the mortgage for the Ghostbusters Headquarters is in his name. His selection for the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man's form of Gozer's \\"Destructor Form\\" was mentioned in a quote \\"It wasn't me this time, I swear it!\\" when the Ghostbusters see that the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is once again terrorizing New York. Ray is the most visibly shaken to see the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man again. Ray is shown to possess skill in operating nautical vessels (i.e.: migrant sponge observation, mentioned earlier) as he's the primary navigator on Marine Ecto-8.

He appears in the films Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, in the animated television series The Real Ghostbusters and Extreme Ghostbusters, in the video games Ghostbusters: The Video Game and Beeline's Ghostbusters. Spengler was portrayed by Harold Ramis in the films and voiced by him in Ghostbusters: The Video Game and Lego Dimensions, and voiced by Maurice LaMarche in the cartoon series. He is a member of the Ghostbusters and one of the three doctors of parapsychology, along with Dr. Peter Venkman and Dr. Ray Stantz. Creation and conception The character of Egon Spengler was named after Oswald Spengler and a classmate of Ramis at Senn High School, Egon Donsbach, a Hungarian refugee.Ghostbusters DVD Commentary Christopher Walken, John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd and Jeff Goldblum were all considered for the role of Egon Spengler, before Ramis, who had gotten close to the character while writing him, felt compelled to play it himself. LaMarche stated that when he auditioned for the part of Spengler in The Real Ghostbusters, he was asked not to do an impression of Ramis, which he ignored because impressions were one of his strengths as a performer, and there was no other way he could imagine properly portraying the character other than to follow Ramis's example. He got the part anyway and said in an interview that he did two different takes: in which he impersonated Ramis, the other in which he tried a more \\"Woody Allen\\"-like approach that did not suit the character's physicality, he admitted.\\"The Real Ghostbusters\\" DVD vol. 1, Special Features: Ain't Afraid Of No Ghost: Creating The Real Ghostbusters (October 2008) Character Egon Spengler is a tall, laconic, bespectacled, awkward member of the team responsible for the main theoretical framework for their paranormal/quantum studies. Being addicted to science, he is the creator of the Ghostbusters' equipment along with Raymond Stantz, thus making him the brains of the Ghostbusters. Although book smart, Spengler does not have much social ability, as demonstrated by his stiff interactions with the Ghostbusters' secretary Janine Melnitz, and his reliance on Peter Venkman as spokesperson for the group. Spengler is the most serious and rigid member of the team. Of his hobbies, Spengler states that he collects \\"spores, molds, and fungus\\", and claims that, as a child, the only toy he ever had was \\"part of a Slinky\\", which he straightened out. As implied in the first movie, Spengler apparently is a sugar junkie, due to his affection for sweets and candy. According to the 2009 video game, Spengler sleeps an average of 14 minutes per day, leaving him \\"a lot of time to work.\\" Appearances =Film= Ghostbusters (1984) Egon was very interested in paranormal phenomena, even while working with Ray Stantz and Peter Venkman at the University. He and Ray Stantz studied paranormal literature in their spare time and were interested in theories of reincarnation. Egon was usually the first to interview case subjects, adding to their mantra, \\"we're ready to believe you.\\" Examples were Dana Barrett from her Zuul encounter and her carriage phenomenon with Oscar. Even people Peter called \\"schizo\\" always went to either Egon or Ray to describe their paranormal experiences, no matter how far-fetched their stories were. For his part, Venkman once took back everything negative he said about him, rewarding the fellow scientist with his favorite candy bar (a Crunch bar). Egon's only weakness is evidently sugar (or at least snacks), as he is seen, on occasion, snacking. Egon developed the technology behind the P.K.E. Meter, the Proton Pack, the Trap, and the storage facility. He was also aware of the risk of crossing the streams. He spent a lot of time focusing on the stability of the storage facility, and was concerned about the possibilities of a P.K.E. surge of dangerous proportions. Egon was particularly critical of Walter Peck's actions, and his attitude that the Ghostbusters were responsible for the explosion of the containment unit that occurred when Peck ordered a municipal worker to shut the unit down. After their encounter with Stay Puft, Egon suggested an atypical solution when he recommended blasting Gozer's dimensional portal while crossing the proton streams to reverse the particle flow and send Gozer back to his/its dimension. Egon once tried to drill a hole in his own head (a process known as trepanning), which he says \\"would have worked\\" if Venkman had not stopped him.Harold Ramis wrote the line about Egon trying to drill a hole in his head. It was inspired by a thwarted experiment by John Lilly, a prominent researcher in dolphin communication who proposed drilling a hole in his head to test some higher brain function. See also: Making Ghostbusters - Page 27. Ghostbusters II (1989) Due to the large amount of collateral damage the city of New York suffered from the battle with Gozer, the Ghostbusters were sued by nearly every county and city agency in New York. Additionally a judicial restraining order was enacted which barred the Ghostbusters from performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators, effectively putting them out of business. Five years after the events of the first film Egon was working at the Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research and was conducting experiments on human emotions. A negative test involved keeping a couple with marriage problems locked in a room for hours and gradually raising the temperature. A positive test involved a girl in a room with dozens of stuffed animals and a puppy. He was the first person Dana Barrett contacted when her baby carriage took off by itself. Egon recommended bringing in Ray, and they both performed a physical exam on Dana's son Oscar. Egon, along with Peter and Ray were later arrested after digging a large hole under First Avenue as part of their paranormal investigations to help Dana. During the course of their trial they were found guilty of willful destruction of public property, fraud, violating their judicial restraining order, and malicious mischief by judge Stephen Wexler (whom Egon said was known as \\"The Hammer\\"). While angrily insulting the trio judge Wexler inadvertently released the ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers; two murderers he sentenced to death by the electric chair. During the chaos judge Wexler dismisses the charges against the Ghostbusters, and rescinds the judicial restraining order allowing Egon, Ray, and Peter to capture the ghosts, effectively putting the Ghostbusters back in business. Egon had a dry sense of humor, of which he used on Peter to bewilder him, and smirked at his friend's cluelessness on what the word \\"epididymis\\" was. Egon primarily worked with Ray, both of whom were still living at the Firehouse, conducting research on the pink slime. Still very scientifically minded, Egon seems to have loosened up a little bit, letting his sense of humor show and even giving Dana a smile and Peter (who was carried away with photographing Vigo's portrait), a knowing smile. Ghostbusters (2016) Although the 2016 Ghostbusters film is a reboot, the film's marketing confirms that a version of Egon Spengler does exist in the film's fictional universe. According to a tie-in video to the film, Kate McKinnon's character Dr. Jillian Holtzmann and Harold Ramis' character Dr. Egon Spengler created the film's proton packs. The paragraph accompanying the video read: > Engineers at Sony Corporation developed the 2016 Proton Pack‚Ñ¢ in > collaboration with nuclear engineer and munitions expert Dr. Jillian > Holtzmann. Sony President and CEO Kazuo Hirai commented ‚ÄúThe perfection of > the Proton Pack‚Ñ¢, long a dream of the world‚Äôs greatest engineers since first > pioneered by Dr. Egon Spengler of Columbia University, is an example of > Sony‚Äôs relentless pursuit of innovation. It absolutely delivers the wow > factor that is so important to our company mission. Additionally, in the film, a bronze bust of Harold Ramis as the film's version of Spengler is seen just as Erin Gilbert leaves her office. During the credits of Ghostbusters, the words \\"For Harold Ramis\\" are seen. Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021) In the 2021 film, which serves as a direct sequel to the original Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, Egon has since passed away and left a house and land, containing Ghostbusters gear, to his daughter Callie and his two grandchildren Phoebe and Trevor. After the near destruction of New York in 1989, cases of paranormal activity ceased and the Ghostbusters shut up shop. Egon spent years investigating Ivo Shandor and bought a ranch near to the mine that the architect used to build Spook Central. Egon discovered that the portal to the Gozer Dimension was only closed and not destroyed, and the Selenium mineral was still supercharged in the earth from the events of 1984. Before he died he left instruction for his family hidden at his ranch. The kids in the film seek the help of their teacher Mr. Gooberson who was a young recruit of the original Ghostbusters team in the early 1990s before it closed. He tracks down the old team. =Television= The Real Ghostbusters Spengler's hair was changed from brown in the films (Ramis's natural hair color) to a blond pompadour in the animated series (Spengler wore his hair in a ponytail on Extreme Ghostbusters). This was reportedly done due to legal issues concerning character / actor likenesses. Despite his leanings toward science, Spengler has a family history of witchcraft (three ancestors, Zedekiah, Eli and Ezekiel, were wizards), of which he is not so much ashamed as \\"strongly\\" considers irrelevant, mainly because he sees science as relevant. Spengler's faith in science was also tested in one episode where the Ghostbusters get abducted to the ghost world by the ghost of Al Capone. Spengler's scientific equipment fails until he is told by former capos of Capone (who aid the Ghostbusters in revenge for Capone double-crossing them) that only magic can harm ghosts in the ghost world as opposed to science harming ghosts in the human world, thus forcing Spengler to accept the wizardry methods of his ancestors to defeat Capone. He is the love interest of Janine Melnitz, the Ghostbusters' secretary, in the first film and both animated series (Ghostbusters II excluded their romance due to Ramis' dislike of the subplot, thus having Melnitz date Louis Tully instead). Spengler sometimes appears to be unaware of Melnitz's romantic interest in him, but at times he displays having similar feelings for her, such as when he gave her a geranium as a gift when she expressed an interest in plants (which backfired horribly when it was revealed that the geranium was possessed by a ghost and nearly destroyed her apartment, along with much of Brooklyn; though Spengler managed to thwart the ghost, Melnitz angrily told Spengler he would have to pay for the damages to her home) and when he rushed to her rescue in \\"Janine, You've Changed\\"; he also embraces her in \\"Ghost Busted\\" after she was kidnapped and held for ransom by a gangster, and became jealous when she was briefly involved with a slimy businessman named Paul Smart. In the episode \\"Cry Uncle\\", Spengler's well-meaning but skeptical uncle Cyrus, visits him and, since he does not believe that Spengler's work with the Ghostbusters is real scientific work and therefore a waste of Spengler's genius, tries to make him come back to Ohio (where Spengler grew up) to work at his uncle's lab, but fortunately, after his uncle accidentally releases the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from the containment unit, he realizes that ghosts are real and accepts Spengler's work. Throughout the series, Spengler would have his soul switched with that of a demon, have his molecular structure destabilized to the point that it stranded him in the Netherworld (requiring him to be rescued by the others), regress into a baby, turn into a were-chicken, and have his intellect switched with Slimer's. He has however, ceased his sugar junkie ways, only to briefly be tempted by a candy store when in Slimer's body (a likely fact that Slimer was an overt glutton). It is revealed in \\"The Boogieman Cometh\\" that, as a child, Spengler was stalked by the boogieman, a supernatural monster that fed on the fear of children and hid in their closets, and was particularly fond of Spengler's fear; it was these encounters with the creature that inspired Spengler to study the paranormal, and as an adult, he would battle the Boogieman twice and defeat him. It is implied in one episode of the animated series that Spengler accidentally burned down his family's garage. Extreme Ghostbusters Spengler is the only original Ghostbuster to return for the Extreme Ghostbusters series as a regular, acting as a mentor to the new Ghostbusters (the others appeared for a two-part episode, \\"Back in the Saddle\\"), and monitoring and sustaining the Containment Unit while working as a paranormal studies professor at a university. He is the de facto leader of the new, younger team of Ghostbusters; although the old team had gone into retirement after they apparently dealt with all the ghosts in the city, after the digging of a new subway tunnel resulted in the release of an ancient ghost, Spengler was forced to recruit his only four current students to act as the new Ghostbusters. Although willing to do his share of the legwork, Spengler overestimates his abilities and his aging becomes apparent when he is no longer able to work at the same level as in his younger days, generally working at the firehouse doing research while the team handle the actual 'Ghostbusting', though when the situation calls for it he will help. Melnitz is still carrying a torch for him, which leaves him a little flustered. He celebrates his 40th birthday during this series, which would put him in his late twenties when The Real Ghostbusters began. Age is the largest factor causing Spengler to having transition from active ghost hunting to a mentorship role; in one episode where the original Ghostbusters guest starred on an episode the audience clearly sees middle adulthood has affected the speed and weakened the stamina of the original Ghostbusters. The Earth Day Special Although Egon Spengler does not appear in the 1990 The Earth Day Special, his character and status as a Ghostbuster is mentioned, and Harold Ramis portrays his twin brother, named Elon Spengler, who is the President of the Wastebusters. =Video games= Ghostbusters: The Video Game A likeness of Ramis, circa 1991 (the year in which the game takes place) appears in the Ghostbusters: The Video Game that was released on June 16, 2009. Ramis also reprised his role for the game by voicing him. In the game, Egon becomes significantly more 'hands-on' during the course of the video game. He and Ray instruct the Rookie in the use of the Proton Pack and its eventual PCS upgrades. Over the course of the game, it becomes evident that he was somewhat traumatized by their exhausting trek up the stairs of 55 Central Park West. While in the alternate dimension of the library, Egon is heard to groan, \\"Oh no,\\" and when Ray asks if he saw something scary, Egon replies, \\"Stairs, lots of stairs\\". Before the \\"Return to Sedgewick Hotel\\" mission, Stantz comments that Spengler was once a coroner, to which he replied that he maintains interest in the subject as a hobby. Beeline's Ghostbusters Spengler appears in Beeline's Ghostbusters game for iOS alongside his niece, Michelle Ying. The game was released on January 24, 2013. Lego Dimensions Spengler appears in Lego Dimensions, with archival audio of Harold Ramis being used to represent his character. =Comics=Egon appears in the Ghostbusters manga, entitled Ghost Busted, where he tells an actress he studied four years at Columbia University, studied two years at Oxford University, and had an extended residence with the Gnostic Monks of Carpathia.

The title derives from the first line of text. :\\"The secret words that the savior spoke to Judas Thomas which I, even I, Mathaias, wrote down, while I was walking, listening to them speak with one another.\\" The colophon appended to the text gives the title The Contender writing to the Perfect. Composition There are two competing theories as to the composition of the text: *Firstly, since it is only the initial 3/5 which constitute dialogue, with the remainder being a monologue, it may have originally been two works, one of dialogue, one of monologue. *Alternatively, and not in the least because of the two titles, the work is thought to have originated as a letter, with a name of the form Epistle of the Contender, written by a Jew who upheld Hellenic philosophy. The text is thought to have later been given a Christian setting and converted into a dialogue, in a similar manner to other works. An additional consideration is that, since the scribe writing the text is named as Matthias, this work may actually be the lost Gospel of Matthias. The dialogue can also be read as an internal conversation between Jesus and his lower self, Judas Thomas, the twin (contender for supremacy of the soul). The New Testament's \\"doubting\\" Thomas and Judas \\"the betrayer\\" could also be symbolic and descriptive of this internal battle between the Christ Self and ego identity. Content The content of this work is quite hyperbolic and gnostic in style, in the sense of imparting a private, arcane knowledge related to good versus evil, and while it lacks references to the elaborate gnostic cosmology, its gnostic allusions to the pleroma and light versus fire clearly point to its origins. > Then the savior continued and said, \\"O unsearchable love of the light! O > bitterness of the fire that blazes in the bodies of men and in their marrow, > kindling in them night and day, and burning the limbs of men and making > their minds become drunk and their souls become deranged... Woe to you, > captives, for you are bound in caverns! You laugh! In mad laughter you > rejoice! You neither realize your perdition, nor do you reflect on your > circumstances, nor have you understood that you dwell in darkness and death! > On the contrary, you are drunk with the fire and full of bitterness. Your > mind is deranged on account of the burning that is in you, and sweet to you > are the poison and the blows of your enemies! And the darkness rose for you > like the light, for you surrendered your freedom for servitude! You darkened > your hearts and surrendered your thoughts to folly, and you filled your > thoughts with the smoke of the fire that is in you! (Book of Thomas the > Contender) The gnostic content in the texts of the Nag Hammadi trove can be argued to be often identical to Jesus' conceptual content, but the metaphorical language and symbolism are strikingly different. \\"The Book of Thomas the Contender\\" and its guidance in overcoming ego \\"lusts/attachments\\" differs markedly with Jesus' gentler, more practical psychological approach in the four canonical Gospels and the Gospel of Thomas.

He played with the Boston Red Sox, New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals.Pitching Splits, Batter Matchups, Daily pitching logs at Retrosheet and daily pitching gamelogs at Baseball-Reference.com. Stallard is most remembered for having given up New York Yankees slugger Roger Maris' 61st home run in 1961. Early career Stallard began his professional career in Minor League Baseball with the Lafayette Red Sox of the Class D Midwest League from 1956 to 1957. Over the two seasons, he notched up win-loss records of 5‚Äì8 and 7‚Äì12, respectively. For the 1958 season, he was promoted to the Raleigh Capitals of the Class B Carolina League, where he posted a 9‚Äì6 record and a 3.09 earned run average. 1959 had several stops for Stallard, the first being the Class AAA Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. Stallard threw for a 7‚Äì11 record and a 3.51 ERA. He also saw time with the Class A Eastern League Allentown Red Sox, where he posted up a 9‚Äì4 record with a dominant 1.68 ERA. During the 1960 season, where Stallard was eventually called up to the major leagues, he posted a 4‚Äì5 record with a 4.82 ERA for Allentown.Minor League Teams, Win-Loss Records, and Earned Run Averages from the Professional Baseball Player Database at Baseball-Almanac.com Boston Red Sox Stallard appeared in four games in his debut season of 1960. He faced 15 batters without giving up a single hit, and amassed 6 strikeouts. Three of his appearances were against the New York Yankees. 1961 marked Stallard's first full season in Major League Baseball, starting in 14 games and playing in a relief role for 29.Right-handed batters only hit .209 off Stallard for the season. He also had a strong month of May, tallying a 2.70 ERA and 16 strikeouts in 10 innings of relief. On July 16, Stallard was given his first Major League start. In 6 innings pitched, Stallard gave up one earned run on six hits, but he would get a no decision as Boston reliever Arnold Earley blew a 1‚Äì0 lead which eventually led to a 4‚Äì3 loss to the Chicago White Sox. Stallard's first victory came on August 10, striking out eight in 8 innings pitched in a 3‚Äì2 victory over the Minnesota Twins. Stallard started in 14 of his last 15 appearances for the season going 2‚Äì7 with a 5.00 ERA and 69 strikeouts in 86 innings pitched as a starter. =Roger Maris's 61st home run= On October 1, 1961, New York Yankees outfielder Roger Maris hit his 61st home run of the season off of Stallard, breaking Babe Ruth's single season record of 60. The contest between the Red Sox and the Yankees was the final game of the season. Stallard, then 2‚Äì6, faced off against Yankees right- hander Bill Stafford (12‚Äì9). In the first duel between Maris and Stallard in the first inning, Stallard threw a changeup to Maris that ended up being a soft fly to left field. In the fourth inning, Stallard fell behind 2‚Äì0 to Maris. Up to that point, Stallard had said that he was probably having the best game he had ever pitched. Stallard threw a fastball, and Maris hit it over the wall for his 61st home run. It was Maris's only hit off Stallard in seven lifetime at bats. Stallard felt no shame over the ordeal, saying, \\"I'm glad he did it off me. Otherwise, I would never have been thought of again. That was about all I did, and I've had a good time with it.\\" There has been speculation that Stallard grooved the pitch in an attempt to help Maris hit the home run, claims which he denied. Stallard struck out five and gave up five hits and just the one earned run in seven innings on the outing, but the Red Sox failed to score in a 1‚Äì0 loss, dropping him to a final record of 2‚Äì7 for the season. Stallard appeared in only one game for the Red Sox in 1962, spending the rest of the season with the minor league Class AAA Seattle Rainiers, where he threw for a 7‚Äì6 record and a 3.49 ERA. New York Mets Stallard resumed full-time major league pitching duty with the young New York Mets in 1963. Boston had shipped him along with Pumpsie Green and Al Moran to the Mets for Felix Mantilla on December 11, 1962. Stallard again started in the relief role for his first 13 games, but was finally given the opportunity to start on June 2. The game against the Pittsburgh Pirates was his first start since the day Roger Maris hit his 61st home run of the season. Stallard responded to the promotion by notching up a 2.28 ERA with 27 strikeouts in innings for the entire month of June. Afterwards, though, Stallard's season fell apart. He ended with a record of 6‚Äì17 to go with a 4.71 ERA. Despite improving his ERA in 1964 to 3.79, Stallard still led the MLB with 20 losses to accompany only 10 wins. Even with his abysmal record, Stallard was still tied for 2nd with Jack Fisher for the highest number of wins for the Mets, only one behind Al Jackson (11‚Äì16). Stallard also gained the unfortunate distinction, albeit less well-known, as the starting pitcher who lost in Jim Bunning's perfect game on June 21, giving up six earned runs in innings. In 11 of his games the Mets scored one or no runs. While with the Mets, Stallard developed something of a taste for New York's night life, dating, among others, actress Julie Newmar, who would go on to play Catwoman in the Batman television series. St. Louis Cardinals On December 7, 1964, Stallard joined the St. Louis Cardinals in a move that sent him to the Cards in exchange for Johnny Lewis and Gordie Richardson.Mets swap Stallard for two young Cards Stallard had the best season of his career in his first year with the Cardinals in 1965. After pitching in his first three games as a reliever, Stallard was moved to starter on April 24, and began the season 7‚Äì3 with a 2.80 ERA. In May alone, Stallard went 3‚Äì0 with a 2.31 ERA in 50 innings. Though going only 3‚Äì2 from September 1 to the end of the season, Stallard still threw for a 2.41 ERA in 33 innings over the period. He finished the season 11‚Äì8 with a 3.38 ERA. Among Cardinals starters, his win total and ERA were second to future Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, who had 20 wins and a 3.07 ERA. Late career During the 1966 season, Stallard was very vocal about his displeasure of being assigned to the bullpen, though he had a 6.10 ERA at the time and had just came off three consecutive games where he gave up one or more earned runs in relief. He was promoted back to the starting role on June 4, but it only amounted to a 5.71 ERA in seven starts, averaging only five innings per outing. His final start on July 19 against the Atlanta Braves was disastrous, giving up five earned runs in just 3 innings pitched. The Cardinals fought back to prevail 10‚Äì9 in 12 innings, but the damage had been done. Stallard played his final Major League game on July 24 against the Chicago Cubs on the front-end of a doubleheader. He came in to pitch in the bottom of the 6th, and gave up a home run to the first batter he faced, Ron Santo. Stallard pitched into the 7th. After giving up another run, reliever Joe Hoerner replaced him on the mound. Soon after his final appearance, the Cardinals reassigned Stallard to the Class AAA Tulsa Oilers of the Pacific Coast League. From 1967 to 1973, he played for several more minor league teams including the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs and High Point-Thomasville Hi-Toms, with stops in Torre√≥n and C√≥rdoba of the Class AAA Mexican League. Stallard took a season off from pitching in 1968, serving as a pitching coach for the Hi-Toms under manager Jack McKeon, previously a Minnesota Twins scout and eventual manager of the 2003 World Series champion Florida Marlins and two-time National League Manager of the Year Award winner. Stallard resumed his playing career in 1969 for High Point-Thomasville by posting a 3‚Äì4 record and a 2.68 ERA. Despite posting solid earned run averages in three of his final four seasons (2.68, 2.52, 2.35), Stallard never received a call to the Majors again. In his final season, 1973, Stallard posted a 5‚Äì11 record with a 2.35 ERA at C√≥rdoba. Over the course of his major league career, some Hall of Fame players had a tough time solving Stallard. Willie Mays was a career .200 hitter off him (6-for-30), Willie McCovey stuttered in at .152 (5-for-33, but with 3 home runs), Roberto Clemente hit .138 (4-for-29), and Frank Robinson could only muster a .214 (6-for-28) success rate against the pitcher. Others legends, however, such as Lou Brock (9-for-16) had no problem rattling Stallard.  Death  Stallard died on December 6, 2017, at the age of 80.

He was killed in the celebrated Hamilton‚ÄìMohun Duel in Hyde Park.  Biography  Mohun was the second child of Charles, 3rd Baron Mohun and his wife Philippa, daughter of Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey. His father died shortly after his birth, following a duel, and left him the family estate. The estate, however, was heavily in debt. Due to this Mohun received no education, and was forced to resort to gambling in order to support his lavish lifestyle. Mohun married Charlotte Orby, granddaughter of Charles Gerard, 1st Earl of Macclesfield, in 1691 with the hope that this match would alleviate some of his debt. Unfortunately he received no dowry for the marriage, and the couple separated shortly thereafter. Following the separation, Mohun's behaviour became ever more licentious. A gambling dispute in late 1692 resulted in his first duel, with John Kennedy, 7th Earl of Cassilis. But Mohun is best remembered for the events of 9 December of that yeara friend of Mohun's, an officer named Richard Hill, had fallen in love with the actress Anne Bracegirdle; however he thought himself, almost certainly erroneously, to face competition from actor William Mountfort. Mohun and Hill ambushed the actor after a performance and, whilst Mohun restrained himor by some eyewitness accounts stood by watching Hill stabbed him through the chest. Following Mountfort's death the next day, Hill fled the country. Captured, Mohun stood trial before the House of Lords. However, in a verdict that was widely condemned, Mohun was acquitted on 6 February 1693. Mohun joined the army shortly after his acquittal. There he served under Charles Gerard, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, the uncle of his former wife, and briefly served in France. In 1697 the Lords again tried Mohun for the murder of Richard Coote following a duel on Leicester Square. Mohun was again acquitted, although his friend Edward Rich, 6th Earl of Warwick was found guilty of manslaughter. After this incident Mohun took his seat in the House of Lords. In 1701 he accompanied the Earl of Macclesfield on a diplomatic mission to Hanover. Following the death of Macclesfield later in the year, Mohun was left most of his estate. He spent over a decade defending his inheritance from rival claimants, most famously from James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton. In 1707 he became a member of the Kit-Cat Club, the pre- eminent Whig political and literary association of the period. Also in 1707 Mohun began building his new country house, Gawsworth New Hall. In 1712, two years after Mohun's Whig party had been heavily defeated in an election, the Duke of Hamilton gained the post of special envoy to Paris. Also at this time Mohun's legal dispute with Hamilton over his inheritance of the Macclesfield estate was going badly. Shortly before Hamilton's scheduled departure for France, Mohun challenged him to a duel which was fought on 15 November in Hyde Park. Many of Hamilton's supporters believed (on the report of Hamilton's second) that the Duke had been killed after slaying Mohun by Mohun's second, General George MacCartney. The only satisfactory evidence was that the principals had mortally wounded each other, both dying at the scene.Gerrard Street Area: The Military Ground, Introduction, at british-history.ac.uk (British History Online), accessed 19 May 2020 Macartney fled and was charged, but acquitted by his peers on his return from France, and the conclusion was that Mohun had wounded Hamilton mortally before dying.  Legacy  William Makepeace Thackeray fictionalised Mohun's duels in his novel The History of Henry Esmond. Mohun and Hamilton suffered such horrific injuries that the government passed legislation banning the use of seconds in such duels. Compare: Also as a result swords were replaced as the weapons of choice in duel by the pistol, which tended to result in shorter and less bloody fights.

The museum also houses the archives of Mack Trucks.  History  As early as 1989, Allentown city officials had announced plans to revitalize an old industrial area, which included the abandoned Arbogast & Bastian meat packing plant, along the Lehigh River. This redevelopment, which was to be known as \\"Lehigh Landing,\\" was to include a museum, a brewery, walking trails, a footbridge across the river, and a promenade for festivals. Development was hindered by fundraising problems, environmental remediation issues, and even a national debate on pork barrel government spending. After three separate groundbreakings (2001, 2004 and 2005), the museum, which cost over $17 million to build, was officially opened to the public on April 12, 2008.

It is notable amongst racing games for its wide and open tracks, and the resulting freedom offered to the player, and also for its excessive speed. It suffered in the marketplace due to thematic similarities with the better received Wipeout by Psygnosis and the generality of its graphics engine made for a very short depth of view compared to contemporary racing games. Bullfrog later released an addon pack for Hi-Octane which included additional features made for the Saturn and DOS, including 3 new tracks and new game modes. Gameplay Hi-Octane screenshot on Sega Saturn The game offers a choice of six hovercraft vehicles differentiated by their top speed, armour, firepower, weight and appearance: KD-1 Speeder, Berserker, Jugga, Vampire, Outrider, and Flexiwing. There are six tracks to race on, with names like New Chernobyl which hint at a dystopian futuristic world (although the game does not feature a backstory). The tracks offer different difficulties, various textures and types of landscape like wastelands and city streets. Certain parts of the track allow to recharge vehicle's fuel, shields or ammo, although the vehicle has to slow down in order to fully benefit of the recharge. There are also power-ups on the tracks, recharging fuel/shield/ammo (10, 100 or 200%) or upgrading the car's minigun, missile or booster, for more power. Other parts of the tracks changed in the course of racing, opening shortcuts or places with scattered upgrades for a short time. The different vehicles display different handling values in the front end but these are just for show, the underlying stats are the same for all the vehicles. Due to the dimensions of models the vehicles appear different sizes but in fact the collision volumes are all identical meaning that you are just as likely to hit something with the Outrider as you are with the Jugga. There are four camera views, switched while playing: three of them are from behind the vehicle with one being further away than the other, and the fourth view is from the front of the car, with no parts of the car obscuring the sight. Development Developer Peter Molyneux stated that in May 1995, EA set Bullfrog under pressure to release Dungeon Keeper in six and a half weeks. \\"Because I wasn't prepared to sacrifice Dungeon Keeper, I wrote and designed a game from scratch in six weeks: Hi-Octane,\\" Molyneux recounted. To allow the development of the game in such a short time, the Magic Carpet engine was used. Producer Sean Cooper's account is slightly different, stating that the game was developed in eight weeks, as a way to \\"fill a quarter that didn't have enough revenue\\". Reception Mark LeFebvre of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the PC version an 8.2, praising the selection of vehicles, the well-balanced challenge, the secret areas, and the networked eight-player racing, though he did remark that there should have been more than six tracks. A critic for Next Generation also considered the small number of tracks to be the game's one shortcoming, and gave it overall approval for its use of texture mapping and Gouraud shading, sense of speed, and overall fun gameplay. Maximum deemed the Saturn version \\"a mildly entertaining but graphically impoverished title for fans of the original only.\\" They criticized the port's many graphical shortcomings, particularly the jerky frame rate, heavy slowdown in two-player mode, lack of texture mapping on enemy craft, and clipping polygon scenery which can cause the player's craft to become stuck. They also took issue with the control configuration and bizarre \\"hot seat\\" multiplayer mode, though they praised the additional courses and selection of cars. In contrast, Rad Automatic of Sega Saturn Magazine called it \\"a brilliant title\\", applauding the varied abilities and handling of the vehicles, the combat elements, the assortment of multiplayer modes, and the hover vehicle physics. While noting that the conversion was not as outstanding as Sega's arcade ports, he nonetheless found it of acceptable quality. GamePro concurred with Maximum that the game has a strong selection of cars and tracks but poor graphics. They also criticized the loose, unresponsive controls and the sounds. Next Generation likewise commented that \\"With its blocky graphics, devilishly slow frame-rate, and nebulous controls, Hi-Octane simply lacks the focus of most console games.\\" He added that the game was very similar to, but clearly inferior to, its contemporaries Cyber Speedway and Wipeout. However, he also stated that \\"One truly awesome concept introduced ... is the realtime morphing tracks which add a great deal to the game's challenge and is sure to be a feature copied in future racing titles.\\" Reviewing the PlayStation version, GamePro said the game is \\"crippled by gummy controls and slow, repetitive gameplay. Flat, unimaginative graphics and sounds cause further problems. Stick with Wipeout - Hi-Octane runs out of gas.\\" Maximum criticized that the drop in frame rate when using the new split screen multiplayer makes the game \\"virtually unplayable\\" and, like GamePro and Next Generation, they compared the game unfavorably to Wipeout: \\"Whereas WipeOut required genuine skill to master its cornering and overtaking, the courses in Hi-Octane have less involving and, with the exception of the odd shortcut, there's very little else to surprise. ...

The crystal violet and bile salts inhibit the growth of Gram-positive organisms which allows for the selection and isolation of gram-negative bacteria. Enteric bacteria that have the ability to ferment lactose can be detected using the carbohydrate lactose, and the pH indicator neutral red. Contents It contains bile salts (to inhibit most Gram-positive bacteria), crystal violet dye (which also inhibits certain Gram-positive bacteria), neutral red dye (which turns pink if the microbes are fermenting lactose). Composition: * Peptone ‚Äì 17 g *Proteose peptone ‚Äì 3 g * Lactose ‚Äì 10 g * Bile salts ‚Äì 1.5 g * Sodium chloride ‚Äì 5 g * Neutral red ‚Äì 0.03 g * Crystal violet ‚Äì 0.001 g * Agar ‚Äì 13.5 g * Water ‚Äì add to make 1 litre; adjust pH to 7.1 +/‚àí 0.2 There are many variations of MacConkey agar depending on the need. If the spreading or swarming of Proteus species is not required, sodium chloride is omitted. Crystal violet at a concentration of 0.0001% (0.001 g per litre) is included when needing to check if Gram-positive bacteria are inhibited. MacConkey with sorbitol is used to isolate E. coli O157, an enteric pathogen. History The medium was developed by Alfred Theodore MacConkey while working as a bacteriologist for the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal. Uses Using neutral red pH indicator, the agar distinguishes those Gram-negative bacteria that can ferment the sugar lactose (Lac+) from those that cannot (Lac-). This medium is also known as an \\"indicator medium\\" and a \\"low selective medium\\". Presence of bile salts inhibits swarming by Proteus species. =Lac positive= By utilizing the lactose available in the medium, Lac+ bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter and Klebsiella will produce acid, which lowers the pH of the agar below 6.8 and results in the appearance of pink colonies. The bile salts precipitate in the immediate neighbourhood of the colony, causing the medium surrounding the colony to become hazy. =Lac negative= Organisms unable to ferment lactose will form normal-colored (i.e., un-dyed) colonies. Examples of non-lactose fermenting bacteria are Salmonella, Proteus species, Yersinia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shigella. =Slow= Some organisms ferment lactose slowly or weakly, and are sometimes put in their own category. These include Serratia and Citrobacter. =Mucoid colonies= Some organisms, especially Klebsiella and Enterobacter, produce mucoid colonies which appear very moist and sticky. This phenomenon happens because the organism is producing a capsule, which is predominantly made from the lactose sugar in the agar. Variant A variant, sorbitol-MacConkey agar, (with the addition of additional selective agents) can assist in the isolation and differentiation of enterohemorrhagic E. coli serotype E. coli O157:H7, by the presence of colorless circular colonies that are non-sorbitol fermenting.

Origins left Early Scouts tied a knot in their neckerchief (scarf) to fasten it around the neck. In the United States, experiments were made with rings made from bone, rope or wood. A young British Scout, Bill Shankley, who was responsible for running a workshop and developing ideas for camping equipment at Gilwell Park, became aware of the American rings, and set out to create something similar. The result was the Gilwell Woggle. On the origin of the woggle, Shankley said: History The earliest known reference to a woggle is the June 1923 edition of The Scout. The term was quickly applied to other designs of fastener, of many shapes and sizes, and is today used around the world. The word ring was used in editions of the Scouting handbook Scouting for Boys until 1929 when Baden-Powell changed it in the 14th edition: > It [the scarf] may be fastened at the throat by a knot or woggle, which is > some form of ring made of cord, metal or bone, or anything you like. Gilwell Woggle A Finnish Gilwell Woggle The Woggle designed by Bill Shankley became known as the Gilwell Woggle, as it has been traditionally presented to leaders who have completed their Wood Badge training. Trained leaders are admitted into 1st Gilwell Park Scout Troop, with the Gilwell Woggle as one of its symbols. Because of its association it is not worn by other Scouts. New Zealand Scout woggle New Zealand Scout woggle The New Zealand Scouts sometimes use a plastic woggle in the shape of a traditional Maori carved head. More commonly though warranted leaders trained to Gilwell Woggle standard are allowed to wear the \\"traditional\\" leather Turk's head woggle. Keas, Cubs, Scouts, Venturers and Rovers all wear either a \\"standard\\" woggle for their section, or home-made \\"special occasion\\" woggles such as the tiki mentioned above. Until trained to the Gilwell woggle level, leaders wear a plaited leather woggle with a dome fastening. Origins of the name One story relating to the origin of the word woggle is that it was named to rhyme with the word boon doggle used in America. However the term woggle pre-dates the first known reference to this in 1925. There are a few other references to the word woggle before its adoption by the Scout movement. It is thought that woggle was a verb, with similar meanings to waggle and wobble, in the 16th century. It was in limited use as a noun around 1900. Other names Although the name woggle is used in many English-speaking countries, in the United States, the term woggle is reserved for the turk's head knot used to secure the neckerchief of Wood Badge participants. In the US, the object used to secure the neckerchief is called a neckerchief slide. An early photographic reference to a slide is in the BSA magazine Scouting of 1 April 1917. The cover for November 1917 issue prominently shows a Scout wearing a slide to hold the neckerchief in place. In the BSA magazine Scouting from August 1923, the term \\"slip-on\\" and \\"slide\\" are both referenced. There is an example of a rams head made of bone and an illustration on how to make your own Turk's head slip-on. The article also comments that the neckerchief should be tied using the four-in-hand knot (often used to tie a necktie) when not using a slide. Two months later, Boys' Life magazine repeated many of the article key points. The name slide or neckerchief slide appears as early as October 1923 with a discussion of the slide being a smart addition to the neckerchief and having some benefits over a knot to tie the neckerchief on. The article makes reference to making your own troop or patrol slide. Also in this same article, on page 63, the Slide is referred to as a \\"Slip-On\\". The first appearance of the term \\"woggle\\" in Boys' Life was in February 1966 with reference to a question in a quiz, asking what woggle is to a British Scout. Neckerchief slides in the United States Standard BSA metal scout slide In the 1930s through the 2000s, Boys' Life magazine (the Boy Scouts of America youth magazine) promoted the use and making of slides through articles and Slide Contests. In the 1920s and 1930s, Boys' Life sponsored contests for unique slides, and winning designs were featured in the magazine. In the late 1940s, a feature article called \\"Slide of the Month\\" began to grace the pages. Most of the articles were written by W. Ben Hunt from Hales Corners, Wisconsin under the pen name \\"Whittlin' Jim\\". Many of the slide ideas were sent into the magazine by Scouts and Scouters as evidenced by the notes Jim included in the article thanking individuals for the slide ideas. After Mr. Hunt's death in the early 1970s, several authors took on the \\"Slide of the Month\\" responsibility. The last article was printed in March 2001, the \\"Rattlesnake\\" made from wire, tube, colored tape, beads, and googly eyes. Over 300 Slide of the Month articles appeared in Boys' Life magazine.

Mezarkabul is known for integrating Anatolian elements into their music. Mezarkabul means 'accepting the grave', 'accepted by the grave' or literally 'grave accept' in Turkish. History Mezarkabul was formed in Bursa in 1986 by guitarist Hakan Utanga√ß and drummer Cenk √únn√º. In 1987, bassist Tarkan G√∂z√ºb√ºy√ºk joined, and they started doing live shows. Their first songs were released in 1990 on the self-titled Pentagram album. In 1992, a second guitarist Demir Demirkan joined the band, as well as a new lead singer, Bartu Toptas, helping Hakan to concentrate on his guitar duties. The new line-up played several gigs until Bartu decided to move back to Sweden. He left the band in March 1992 just when they had started to record the Trail Blazer album. The voice in the beginning of \\"Secret Missile\\" is Bartu's. To fill Bartu's void, the Mezarkabul members hired vocalist Og√ºn Sanlƒ±soy. They released their second album Trail Blazer in the same year and enjoyed growing popularity, both in Turkey and across the world. In 1993 guitarist √úmit Yƒ±lbar was killed by terrorists on the mountain of Cƒ±raf while he was serving the Turkish army. The remaining members recorded \\"Fly Forever\\" in memory of √úmit Yƒ±lbar, but the band recorded more songs that dealt with Yƒ±lbar's death: \\"1,000 in the Eastland\\" and \\"Anatolia\\" (both from the album Anatolia). For the next three years, the band toured in Turkey and other countries. In 1995, vocalist Murat ƒ∞lkan replaced Og√ºn, and they started working on their next album, Anatolia, which was released in Turkey in 1997. Several weeks after the release, Century Media approached Mezarkabul for a worldwide release. The lyrics of Anatolia addressed war, pain and ignorance, often in an unusual way. In \\"1,000 in the Eastland\\" the lyrics stress that \\"thousands of people are dying in the East, all ignored by the West, where one death becomes a tragedy\\", at the same time emphasizing that \\"fighting with hatred feeds the rich men\\". The album has been praised by Sea of Tranquility. They released a live album in 1997 called Pop√ßular Dƒ±≈üarƒ±. Guitarist Demir Demirkan departed, and was temporarily replaced with Onur \\"Mr. Cat\\" Pamuk√ßu. The band started recording its next album in 2000 in its own studio in Istanbul. Guitarist Metin T√ºrkcan officially joined the band during the recording session. They composed 17 songs, and decided to split it into two different CDs. In 2001, Unspoken was released worldwide. In 2002, Bir was released in Turkey. For their releases in Turkey, they use the name \\"Pentagram\\". However, due to an American doom metal band called Pentagram, they go by the name \\"Mezarkabul\\" for international releases. Sony Music released in 2008 Mezarkabul's concert album 1987, which includes the band's 20th anniversary concert in Bostancƒ± G√∂steri Merkezi on 4 February 2007. The band celebrated their 25th year with their album MMXII. In 2014 they released their live album \\"Live MMXII\\" which consisted of live performances of the band since 2012. In 2017, past members Demir Demirkan, Og√ºn Sanlƒ±soy and Murat ƒ∞lkan rejoined the band for their 30th anniversary release \\"Akustik\\" where Turkish musician ≈ûebnem Ferah features as well. They also played live shows as an octet with acoustic instruments, before reverting back to electric instruments. The band usually plays live shows as a septet; with Demir only occasionally appearing in live shows, however it has been confirmed on Demir's instagram page that he will feature on their upcoming album. Influence on Turkish music Mezarkabul is often considered to be the pioneers of heavy metal in Turkey. The band's work has inspired all forms of rock music and helped it to gain popularity in Turkey. They were known to collaborate with the late vocalist of Vitamin, G√∂khan Semiz, and Vitamin itself. Also, Tarkan G√∂z√ºb√ºy√ºk has produced, arranged and performed with numerous artists and bands. Early examples of his work as a contributing artist includes ≈ûebnem Ferah's debut album titled Kadƒ±n which was a huge success in Turkey. Later on in 2005, G√∂z√ºb√ºy√ºk produced Ferah's album titled Can Kƒ±rƒ±klarƒ±. Another example, Mor ve √ñtesi's groundbreaking album D√ºnya Yalan S√∂yl√ºyor was produced by G√∂z√ºb√ºy√ºk. Other than contributions to rock music, Mezarkabul members continued to contribute to popular music as well. Demir Demirkan, as he pursued his solo career, wrote the lyrics and produced the first Turkish song ever to win the Eurovision song contest. Tuna Kiremit√ßi, of the Vatan newspaper, wrote an article about the band, praising their contributions.

She is the Ghostbusters' secretary, confidante, and occasionally, a ghostbuster herself. She was played by Annie Potts in both movies, and in The Real Ghostbusters she was voiced initially by Laura Summer, and later on the series by Kath Soucie. In Extreme Ghostbusters, she was voiced by Pat Musick. Potts returned to provide her appearance and voice to Janine in the 2009's Ghostbusters: The Video Game. Personal life Throughout most Ghostbusters media, Janine is often displayed as having a romantic attraction to Egon Spengler. This is shown in the first movie and more prominently in The Real Ghostbusters cartoons. In Ghostbusters II, however, she becomes involved with Louis Tully, who has become the team's financial advisor and lawyer. Despite this, Janine retains her attraction to Egon throughout the entire Real Ghostbusters series and into the Extreme Ghostbusters series. In \\"Janine's Genie\\", in which Janine encounters an evil genie after receiving a possessed lamp (unaware that the genie is evil), one of her wishes was for Egon to fall in love with her, and in one instance when she is driving Ecto-1, Egon comments \\"Janine, you're beautiful when you drive.\\" Egon and Janine share a handful of tender moments throughout the series, but Egon's somewhat stilted emotions often create a barrier between them. Ghostbusters I, II and Afterlife In Ghostbusters, Janine is hired as the secretary of the Ghostbusters, where she keeps tabs on the clients. She also interviews Winston Zeddemore for the job as the fourth member of the team. Later, she helps Egon interviewing Louis Tully who was possessed by Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster of Gozer. After the battle with Gozer, she is seen outside of 55 Central Park West, hugging Egon, happy to see him alive and well, joining the rest of the Ghostbusters as they drive off in the Ecto-1. In Ghostbusters II, she is rehired as secretary by the Ghostbusters, working side-by-side with Louis Tully, who became the team's financial advisor, accountant and lawyer. Later, Peter Venkman assigns her to baby-sit Dana Barrett's baby Oscar. She asks Louis Tully to babysit with her, where she, along with Dana and Louis see Oscar being kidnapped by Dana's boss, Janosz Poha. In order to help the guys fight Vigo the Carpathian, she lends Louis one of Egon's spare suits and a spare Proton pack, so he can join them in the battle. After the battle, she attends a ceremony to restore the Statue Of Liberty, where she and the Ghostbusters are awarded the Key to the City from the mayor. Potts confirmed that she will reprise her role as Janine in Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021). The Real Ghostbusters Janine is the youngest daughter of a working-class family. Though her parents, sister, nephew and grandmother all live in Canarsie (as seen in \\"Janine's Day Off\\"), she has remained in Brooklyn Heights, where she grew up. She tends to wear loud, blocky jewelry and (in early seasons) wears a mini-skirt at work. In 1987, Janine owns a red Volkswagen Beetle convertible, which is severely damaged after being loaned to the Ghostbusters in \\"Beneath These Streets\\". In \\"Baby Spookums\\" she has a yellow Renault 5 Le Car, although it is not known if this is a loaner/rental or her own car; in later instances she owns a pink Beetle convertible. On numerous occasions, Janine has been forced to take up a Ghostbusters uniform and proton pack to bail the guys out of trouble in episodes \\"Mr. Sandman, Dream Me A Dream\\", \\"Janine‚Äôs Day Off\\", \\"Janine Melnitz, Ghostbuster\\" and \\"Jailbusters\\". In the episode \\"Janine Melnitz, Ghostbuster\\" from Season 2, she borrows one of Peter Venkman's uniforms, and in the Extreme Ghostbusters episode \\"A Temporary Insanity\\" she borrowed one of Egon Spengler's. She has a sharp, sarcastic sense of humor and has been known to make jokes about the Ghostbusters, either to their faces or under her breath, but most of the time she usually gets along with Ray and Winston, while usually having a kind of sibling rivalry with Peter. =Changes in The Real Ghostbusters= Season 3 of Real Ghostbusters saw significant changes to the character. In the first two seasons, her portrayal was almost identical to the rude secretary Potts portrayed in the film. However, Season 3 saw Janine get a new voice actor, a new character design, and a softened personality. Notably, her thick Brooklyn accent disappeared. In the Season 6 episode \\"Janine, You've Changed\\", it is revealed that her changes were the result of her wishes to a \\"makeoveris lotsabucks\\", a demon posing as a fairy godmother (and even referred to as such by Janine herself). This was one of a handful of episodes writer J. Michael Straczynski wrote as a favor to the show's producers, as he could not return as a full-time writer due to other working commitments he had at the time. As such, the demon fed off of Janine's insecurity regarding her looks, and frustration in failing to win Egon's heart. The demon used her magic to blind Egon (and the other Ghostbusters) to Janine's changes, thus making Janine more dependent on the demon for \\"improvements\\" on her appearance in hopes she would become \\"perfect,\\" making Egon notice her. Unknown to Janine, the demon was feeding on desire to be \\"perfect\\" for Egon to slowly strip away her humanity, and turn her into a \\"makeoveris lotsabucks\\" herself. None of the Ghostbusters noticed until Slimer showed them pictures of Janine in their photo album. They demonstrated her startling changes over the years with a hologram projector. The demon had used ectoplasmic energy to alter Janine's cellular and bone structure. When Janine leaves the firehouse to meet the demon alone, the Ghostbusters send Slimer go after her. In the car Egon tells the others, just as he's realizing how much Janine means to him, now he could lose her forever. In the climax of the episode, Janine turns into a \\"makeoverus lotsabucks\\" with powers similar to those of her \\"fairy godmother\\" (allowing her to change her own appearance at will). She lashes out at Egon when he comes to her rescue, blaming him for hardly ever acknowledging her affection for him. Egon defeats the demon's hold over Janine by confessing his love for her (the NOW and Marvel UK comics ignore these changes). Egon's confession proves sincere (and is not just a way of defeating the demon), as he and Janine are later seen sitting on a bench together, watching the sun rise. It is here Egon puts his arm round Janine and asks her out on a date. Janine's character was changed at the suggestion of consultants, who said that they wanted to change the shape of Janine's glasses (which they thought would frighten children), and change her from a feisty character to the \\"mother\\" of the Ghostbusters group as they felt she was \\"too abrasive\\". Additionally, the Brooklyn accent was discarded with a change in voice actresses. This, among other reasons, was why writer J. Michael Straczynski left The Real Ghostbusters. Extreme Ghostbusters Set six years after the series finale of The Real Ghostbusters, Janine had bounced from various jobs since the Ghostbusters closed down in 1991. Having been recently downsized from her last job she returned to school at the New York City College and amongst the various (and unmentioned) courses she was taking was a paranormal one, where she was reunited with Egon, going on to help him form the new team. Video games Janine has had brief appearances in the Extreme Ghostbusters Game Boy Color game (only released in Europe) and in the Extreme Ghostbusters game, Code Ecto-1 for the Game Boy Advance. Annie Potts reprised her role as Janine in the Ghostbusters: The Video Game, once again being the team's secretary, warning them about what's going on, either by calling them or by radio, and making sarcastic comments about the situation. Her physical appearance is quite similar to the way she appeared in the second movie. Janine appears as a non-playable character in the Ghostbusters Adventure World of Lego Dimensions voiced by Courtenay Taylor. She has two missions for the player: The first one has the player busts some ghosts for the mayor, while the second one requires the player to assist her in recovering the books for Ray's bookstore after they're scattered by ghosts. Portrayals In the film series and Ghostbusters: The Video Game, she was portrayed by Annie Potts. In the cartoon series The Real Ghostbusters, she was originally voiced by Laura Summer and later by Kath Soucie. In the cartoon series Extreme Ghostbusters, she is voiced by Pat Musick.

Hunter Island and Matthew Island, apart, are claimed by Vanuatu as part of Tafea Province, and considered by the people of Aneityum part of their custom ownership, and were claimed by France as part of New Caledonia. Small, arid, without fresh water and not easily accessible, the islands had no interest for Britain or France during their colonization of the Pacific in the course of the 18th and 19th centuries. France officially annexed both islands in 1929. In 1965, the United Kingdom also claimed the two islands, as part of the New Hebrides. France conducted a symbolic occupation in 1975. In 1980, on its independence, Vanuatu claimed sovereignty, but made no occupation of the islands. In 1979, M√©t√©o-France set up an automatic weather station on one of the islands, and the French Navy regularly visits both of them. Matthew Island Matthew Island () is in area, with a high stratovolcano located at . The volcanic island is composed of two andesitic-to-dactic volcanic cones, East Matthew and West Matthew, separated by a rocky 200-metre-wide isthmus. The island was discovered by Captain Thomas Gilbert, of , on 27 May 1788, who named it after the owner of his ship. At the time of the discovery, only East Matthew existed and it was described as having only one peak prior to the Second World War. East Matthew is the older part of the island, formed from basalt with a half-destroyed, 142-m-high composite volcanic cone that is thought to be composed of three lava flows. There is still some volcanic activity on the island with sulphuric fumaroles rising from craters in the south-east. West Matthew formed in the late 1940s and may have had eruptions as recent as 1976. It is a roughly circular, -high cone with a serrated peak and is composed almost entirely of lava flows and slag. It contains a crater that is breached to the northwest. A lava flow from West Matthew makes up the northwest coast of the island. =Eruptions= All known historical eruptions have come from West Matthew. After a highly seismically active period in the 1940s, construction of West Matthew began as submarine eruptions built up a new island. The new cone then emitted lava flows. The eruption was a VEI 2. Another VEI 2 eruption from West Matthew took place in October 1954, while a very small (VEI 0) fissure eruption occurred in approximately 1956. This marks the latest confirmed activity on Matthew Island, although tremors took place near the island in 2008, 2009 and 2011. Uncertainty surrounds a report of an eruption in 1828, as well as reports of eruptions in 1966 and 1976. Hunter Island Hunter Island () is also known as Fern or Fearn Island. The first recorded sighting of the island was by Captain Thomas Fearn from his trading ship Hunter in 1798.Sharp, Andrew (1962), The discovery of the Pacific Islands, Oxford University Press, p.181 It lies east of Matthew Island at . About in area, the island has a domed shape, and is high. It is composed of andesite ‚Äì dactic lavas and numerous explosion craters dot the volcano. A cone makes up the south part of the island, with its central crater filled by a lava dome. A -deep crater is located on the north-west side of the island. Fumarolic and solfataric activity continues in the north of the island, as well as on the northeast and southeast coasts. Two small eruptions took place in the mid-1800s. In 1835, a lava flow erupted and on 15 March 1841, an explosive eruption took place. In 1895, lava was seen flowing from two craters on the east side of the island. A small (VEI 0) fissure eruption took place in 1903, on the northern side of the island, and produced lava. Hunter Island is symbolically claimed by a micronation, the Federal Republic of Lostisland.

He was played by Ernie Hudson in both movies and was voiced by Arsenio Hall in the first two seasons of The Real Ghostbusters. Buster Jones provided Winston's voice in the remaining seasons, and he reprised the role in a cameo on Extreme Ghostbusters. Hudson returned to provide his appearance and voice to Zeddemore in 2009's Ghostbusters: The Video Game. Conception and creation In the original script for Ghostbusters, Winston Zeddemore was intended to be part of the Ghostbusters team from the beginning, a former \\"Air Force major something, a demolitions expert\\". This was revised in subsequent drafts after Hudson was cast. His character was originally intended to represent the audience, but was rewritten to be \\"an outsider and a late addition\\" to the Ghostbusters team. Veteran actor Yaphet Kotto auditioned and was offered the role, but had to drop out due to other commitments. After working with him the previous year on Trading Places, Dan Aykroyd originally wanted Eddie Murphy to play the role of Winston Zeddemore. Aware of his comic abilities, his characterization of Winston would have been in a semi-improvisational style, similar to Bill Murray's performance as Peter Venkman. Murphy was too busy shooting Beverly Hills Cop to commit. Appearances =Film= Ghostbusters (1984) Winston Zeddemore's first on-screen appearance is in the movie Ghostbusters, when he responds to a help-wanted advertisement the team has posted in an attempt to deal with their sizable workload. Questioned extensively during his application by Janine Melnitz as to whether he believes in a large number of supernatural occurrences and beings (such as UFOs, the Loch Ness Monster and the theory of Atlantis among others), Zeddemore replies, \\"If there's a steady paycheck in it, I'll believe anything you say.\\" Later in the movie, having seen the level of paranormal activity present in the city, he remarks, \\"This job is definitely not worth eleven-five [$11,500] a year!\\" Zeddemore is a religious man to some extent, saying in a discussion in Ghostbusters that he believes in God and \\"loves Jesus' style\\". While driving the Ecto-1 with Ray, he voices his thoughts that the sudden spike in ghost appearances might be a sign of the apocalypse, pointing out that while they have come to treat capturing ghosts as routine pest control, in a very real sense the dead are literally \\"rising from the grave\\". Though Zeddemore has no previous background in paranormal studies and is not initially a firm believer in the existence of the paranormal, he readily accepts the existence of ghosts and the supernatural as he encounters them as a Ghostbuster. However, despite this, he continues to act as an 'everyman' and voice of reason for the team, and when the jailed Ghostbusters seriously proposes asking a U.S. federal judge to release them because they must fight an invading god, Zeddemore reminds the others that no one will believe their claims. Ghostbusters II (1989) At the start of the sequel Ghostbusters II, the team has been forced out of business due to legal injunctions and property damage lawsuits. Zeddemore and Ray Stantz work as unpopular children's entertainers, but rejoin the team after the ban against them is lifted. Winston helps Ray and Egon investigate the mysterious river of slime under the city, being \\"hit\\" by the specter of a train that derailed decades earlier and caused hundreds of deaths. Later, he helps them pilot the Statue of Liberty (suffused with slime charged by positive emotions) through New York City to rally the public and defeat Vigo the Carpathian. Ray remarks that the slime reminds him of Jell-O, a dessert Winston hates. Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021) Hudson confirmed that he will reprise his role as Zeddemore in Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021). The Real Ghostbusters Many details of Zeddemore's personality and character are revealed in episodes of The Real Ghostbusters. The episode \\"Cry Uncle\\" clarifies that, in the show's continuity, Winston has no doctorate; he also informs Egon's skeptical Uncle Cyrus that, prior to becoming a Ghostbuster, he too doubted the existence of ghosts. In \\"Mr. Sandman, Dream Me a Dream,\\" Winston states that, unlike his three colleagues, he is not a scientist, causing him to doubt his ability to resolve a crisis when the Sandman traps the others within their own dreams, but with encouragement from a dream- version of Albert Einstein, he meets the challenge and wins the day. \\"The Ghostbusters in Paris\\" reveals that Winston was once a construction worker prior to joining the Ghostbusters. This idea seems to be further reinforced in the episode \\"The Brooklyn Triangle\\", when the Ghostbusters respond to a construction site headed by his father; this would indicate that it might have been a family business, until Winston decided to join the Ghostbusters. In the episode \\"Devil To Pay\\", Zeddemore mentions having a girlfriend, though she is never seen on screen during the series. In \\"Night Game\\", he is shown to love baseball, and his favorite team is the Jaguars. In several other episodes it is shown that Zeddemore loves mystery novels and detective stories, and in \\"Boodunnit\\" he is the one who solves the mystery novel left behind by a deceased mystery writer similar to Agatha Christie, allowing her soul to rest. In \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" it is revealed that Zeddemore also likes classical literature, including the works of Herman Melville and Charles Dickens. He is also a fan of The Alan Parsons Project. \\"The Brooklyn Triangle\\" introduces Winston's father, Ed, who works in construction. Their relationship is shown to have been strained because of Winston choosing to be a Ghostbuster, but they reconcile by the end of the episode. Finally, in the episode \\"The Moaning Stones\\", Zeddemore is revealed to be the reincarnation of Shima Buku, a shaman at war with an immortal demon known only as the Undying One. =Zeddemore and the Ecto-1= Winston is the primary driver of Ecto-1 for more than a few moments in the two films. As a result, he is almost always shown driving the car in The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, and is often seen performing routine maintenance such as oil changes on the vehicle. In an episode of the cartoon where the Ghostbusters are sent back in time to the 1950s, Winston sees Ecto-1 in its original role as a hearse telling the other Ghostbusters he would know the vehicle anywhere, he says to the car, \\"Hang in there Ectobetter days are ahead for you\\", illustrating how fond Zeddemore is of the car. Extreme Ghostbusters Winston only appears in the two-part series finale. After the closing down of the Ghostbusters, Winston got his pilot's license, being the first and only Ghostbuster to be a certified pilot. The Super Mario Bros. Super Show Ernie Hudson appears as himself in the episode \\"Slime Busters\\" of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. =Video games= Ghostbusters II (NES) Winston was featured as a playable character in Ghostbusters II for NES. New Ghostbusters II Winston was featured as a playable character in New Ghostbusters II for NES and Game Boy. Ghostbusters: The Video Game A likeness of Hudson, circa 1991 (the year in which the game takes place) appears in the Ghostbusters: The Video Game that was released on June 16, 2009. Hudson also reprised his role for the game by voicing him. In the game, between the Vigo incident and Thanksgiving 1991, Winston has acquired his doctorate, is now addressed as \\"Doctor\\" along with his colleagues. Zeddemore can be heard quipping \\"That's Dr. Zeddemore to you, punk!\\" when defeating enemies. He mentions that he \\"pretty much lived\\" in the museum's exhibit on ancient Egypt while in school, revealing that his degree is in Egyptology. On his one day off, Winston went to go see a performance of the Aida opera. However, the Psi Energy Pulse officially cancelled his plans. After Janine delivered the message, Winston left to meet up with the other Ghostbusters at the Sedgewick Hotel. He endured four hours of traffic but made it to the hotel just in time to see the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. During their final confrontation, Ivo Shandor mocks Winston, saying that he always thought Winston was the \\"slow\\" one of the group, much to Winston's surprise. When Shandor is destroyed, everyone flees the mausoleum. Winston carries the exorcised Mayor Mulligan outside until he regains consciousness. Beeline's Ghostbusters Zeddemore appears in Beeline Interactive's Ghostbusters game for iOS. The game was released on January 24, 2013. Lego Dimensions Zeddemore appears in Lego Dimensions, with archival audio of Ernie Hudson being used to represent his character. Name misspelling The name \\"Zeddemore\\" is misspelled as \\"Zeddmore\\" in the closing credits of Ghostbusters. As a result it was also sometimes misspelled in scripts and other sources related to The Real Ghostbusters. The name is spelled correctly on the nametag on Winston's jumpsuit, in the shooting script of Ghostbusters (as published in the book Making Ghostbusters), and in the closing credits of Ghostbusters II. The name is also pronounced correctly (with three syllables) by both Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson in Ghostbusters. References BibliographyShay, Don (1985).

He was a Liberal member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1990, and represented the central Ontario riding of Muskoka‚ÄìGeorgian Bay. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson. Background Black was born in Bracebridge, Ontario and graduated from the University of Toronto in 1955.. He was a secondary school teacher and principal from 1958 to 1980, and was superintendent of the Muskoka Board of Education from 1980 to 1987. He has also served as past president of Muskoka Children's Aid. He and his wife, Beth raised four children. Politician Black joined the Ontario Liberal Party in 1985. He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1987 provincial election defeating Progressive Conservative candidate George Beatty in Muskoka‚ÄìGeorgian Bay, a new riding created by redistribution. Previously the area was represented by the riding of Muskoka which had been held by former Progressive Conservative premier Frank Miller until 1987, and the PCs were historically the dominant party in the area. Black was considered a strong candidate, however, and his victory was not entirely unexpected. Black credited his victory to a strong campaign team, popular satisfaction with Liberal leader David Peterson, and the fact that some local PCs were unhappy with party leader Larry Grossman. In August 1988, Peterson appointed Black as a one-man task force to review government and non-government programs against drug abuse. His report, issued in mid-October, recommended mandatory drug education starting in the early grades, drug treatment and education programs for offenders, increased training about drugs for social workers and health care workers, and the addition of about thirty-six officers to the provincial drug unit. Black criticized the \\"zero tolerance\\" approach of the American \\"war on drugs\\", arguing that it was largely ineffective. After the report's release, Black was named special advisor to the premier on drugs with responsibility for co- ordinating and monitoring all government programs against drug abuse. In December 1988, he announced a pilot project for substance abuse counselling operated by the YMCA of Metropolitan Toronto. Black was promoted to the provincial cabinet on August 2, 1989, serving as Minister of Tourism and Recreation and also responsible for the provincial anti-drug strategy. He introduced a new provincial anti-drug strategy in November 1989 that fulfilled some of his previous recommendations, including the hiring of more police officers and the introduction of early education programs. It also allocated $4.5 million for community-based pilot projects against drug abuse. In June 1990, heannounced that this funding would be targeted to projects in nine communities. Black was critical of the federal Goods and Services Tax introduced by the government of Brian Mulroney, arguing that it would put Ontario's tourism sector at risk of losing jobs and revenue. Tourism in Ontario declined in this period, due in large part to a continental economic downtown. Black travelled to Paris in December 1989 to support Toronto's bid to host Expo 2000. Toronto lost the bid Hanover, West Germany. Black's time in cabinet was brief. The Liberals suffered an upset loss to the New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election, and Black finished third in his bid for re-election. In 1991-92, he was chief organizer for Charles Beer's unsuccessful bid to succeed Peterson as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. He attempted to return to the provincial legislature in the 1995 election, but finished well behind Progressive Conservative candidate Bill Grimmett. =Cabinet positions= Later life Black later served as president of the Muskoka Heritage Foundation, and founded the Muskoka Watershed Council in 2001. He was appointed as a director of the Toront03 Alliance in July 2003. On August 29, 2016 he died from an undiagnosed case of acute leukemia.

United States  In American society, the middle class may be divided into two or three sub-groups. When divided into two parts, the lower middle class, also sometimes simply referred to as \\"middle class\\", consists of roughly one third of households, roughly twice as large as the upper middle or managerial class.

Though not common in sociological models, the middle class may be divided into three sections in vernacular language usage. In this system the term lower middle class relates to the demographic referred to as working class in most sociological models.

Biography Travaglio was born in Turin and earned a degree in history from the University of Turin. In 1992 he began to pursue journalism as a career. He started out writing for Catholic publications such as Il nostro tempo (\\"Our time\\"), then worked under the renowned journalist Indro Montanelli for newspapers such as Il Giornale and La Voce and gained the attention of Montanelli himself who once said of him: \\"No, Travaglio does not kill anyone. With a knife. He uses a more refined and not legally punishable weapon: the archives\\". Between 2006 and 2011, Marco Travaglio was a regular guest of the TV program AnnoZero, hosted by Michele Santoro (also mentioned by Berlusconi in the so-called Bulgarian Edict). Recently, Travaglio has contributed as a columnist to prominent national newspapers and magazines, such as La Repubblica, L'Unit√† (hosting columns such as \\"Bananas\\", \\"Uliwood Party\\" and \\"Zorro\\") and Micromega. He still contributes to L'espresso writing a column by the name \\"Signorn√≤'\\". In September 2009 he contributed to the founding of the independent newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano (\\"The Daily Fact\\"). He became editor in chief of the paper in 2015. Political and judicial events of national importance, from Mani pulite to the troubles of controversial political figure Silvio Berlusconi, have been Travaglio's main area of interest. The journalist gained public attention in 2001, after participating in a TV show on state-owned national channel Raidue called Satyricon and hosted by Daniele Luttazzi. He then introduced his bestseller book L'odore dei soldi (\\"The Scent of Money\\", co-authored by :Elio Veltri), which investigates the origin of Mr Berlusconi's early fortunes. Berlusconi filed a lawsuit for slander, but since the information was accurate and well documented, he was condemned to pay the legal expenses. Court sentence The show, aired during the campaign for the Italian general election, was heavily criticized by Berlusconi and his party and labeled by them as a politically motivated, non- objective personal attack. After Mr Berlusconi's victory at the elections, Berlusconi banned Luttazzi (together with Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro, prominent journalists that had criticized Mr Berlusconi's or investigated his history) from state-owned TV shows (Editto Bulgaro), causing a long debate about freedom of information and censorship in Italy. On 10 May 2008, Marco Travaglio commented on Renato Schifani's election as president of the Senate that one should \\"simply ask of the second highest office of the state to explain those relationships with those men who have subsequently been condemned for association with the Mafia\\" on the RAI current affairs talk show television program Che tempo che fa. ¬´Schifani diffamato da Travaglio¬ª, Corriere della Sera, 11 May 2008 Fazio chiede scusa in Tv a Schifani, La Repubblica, 11 May 2008 Compromised by compromise, blog by John Hooper (The Guardian), 13 May 2008 The statement of Travaglio resulted in fierce negative reactions from Italian politicians, including from the centre left, except for Antonio Di Pietro who said that Travaglio was \\"merely doing his job\\". Some called for chief executives at RAI to be dismissed. The political commentator (and future leader) Beppe Grillo supported Travaglio, while Schifani announced he would go to Court and sue Travaglio for slander.

Historically, dumy were performed by itinerant Cossack bards called kobzari, who accompanied themselves on a kobza or a torban, but after the abolition of Hetmanate by the Empress Catherine of Russia the epic singing became the domain of blind itinerant musicians who retained the kobzar appellation and accompanied their singing by playing a bandura (rarely a kobza) or a relya/lira (a Ukrainian variety of hurdy-gurdy). Dumas are sung in recitative, in the so-called \\"duma mode\\", a variety of the Dorian mode with raised fourth degree. Dumy were songs built around historical events, many dealing with the military actions in some form.Clegg, p. 247 Embedded in these historical events were religious and moralistic elements. There are themes of the struggle of the Cossacks against enemies of different faiths or events occurring on religious feast-days. Although the narratives of the dumy mainly revolve around war - the dumy themselves do not promote courage in battle.Kononenko, Natalie O. ‚ÄúThe Influence of the Orthodox Church on Ukrainian Dumy.‚Äù Slavic Review 50 (1991): p.573. The dumy impart a moral message in which one should conduct oneself properly in the relationships with the family, the community, and the church.Kononenko, Natalie O. ‚ÄúThe Influence of the Orthodox Church on Ukrainian Dumy.‚Äù Slavic Review 50 (1991): p.573. However, the kobzari did not play only religious songs and dumy. They also played ‚Äúsatirical songs (sometimes openly scabrous); dance melodies; either with or without words; lyric songs; and historical songs‚Äù.Kononenko, Natalie O. ‚ÄúThe Influence of the Orthodox Church on Ukrainian Dumy.‚Äù Slavic Review 50 (1991): p.570. The origin The relationship between the military and the religion with dumy originated in the Cossack rebellion of 1648. Ukraine fell under the control of the Catholic Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, that imposed discriminatory measures on the Eastern Orthodox Church. This rebellion was followed by ‚Äúpartition and eventual subjugation of the Ukrainian lands and the Ukrainian church.Kononenko, Natalie O. ‚ÄúThe Influence of the Orthodox Church on Ukrainian Dumy.‚Äù Slavic Review 50 (1991): p.574. The Cossacks rebelled against the religious oppression and their lands were eventually lost to the oppressor. This causes a great dilemma in the church because the Cossacks were defenders of the faith, and since they lost, and the faith is infallible, the Cossacks themselves must have done something sinful.Kononenko, Natalie O. ‚ÄúThe Influence of the Orthodox Church on Ukrainian Dumy.‚Äù Slavic Review 50 (1991): p.575. This is why dumy has a great religious undertone and is a song that tells of death and defeat, not of victory.Kononenko, Natalie O. ‚ÄúThe Influence of the Orthodox Church on Ukrainian Dumy.‚Äù Slavic Review 50 (1991): p.571-4.  Textual characteristic  Dumy, as an epic, in comparison to other epic forms do not contain elements of fantasy.  Linguistic characteristics  The dominant element of dumy is language. Rhythm is rhetorical, often falling on a verb placed at the end. The use of parallelisms is widespread, epithets are standard, the use of specific numbers is also widespread. The use of archaic forms of language are also popular as is the use of retardation.  Musical characteristics  = Melodic characteristics = The melodies of dumy consist of * repetitive recitative-like passages on one note, changing to a different tone with lingual accent, usually stepwise and occasionally by a 4th * melodic recitative-like with falling scalic passages * melodic closed and semi-closed cadences with characteristic melisma * a zaplachka based on the word \\"hey\\" often very ornate with many melismatic features paralleling the stylistic features of the melody. * a slavnoslovia (verbal glorification) at the end of the piece. A summation of the work which in some regions is spoken rather than sung. Almost all traditional dumy from the Poltava and Slobozhan traditions use a Dorian mode with occasionally raised 4th degrees and subseptatonium. The raised 4th often is used as a secondary leading note to the dominant. The appearance of the augmented 2nd between the 3rd and 4th degrees gives the duma an eastern sounding flavour and is used by the performer to add \\"zhal'\\" (pity) to the work. =Accompaniment = Dumy are traditionally sung to an instrumental accompaniment, usually that of a bandura, kobza or lira. In the Slobozhan tradition the bandura would play most of the notes of the melody with the voice apart from chromatic accidentals and melisma with occasional chords on I, IV and V degrees of the Dorian mode. The instrument would also be used for instrumental preludes, interludes and postludes. In the Poltava tradition the instrumental accompaniment is much sparser with the player not playing the melody but rather occasional chords based on the tonic and dominant of the Dorian. In lira accompaniment from Poltava, no melodies are played with the voice during the performance of the duma. Melodic instrumental playing is confined to preludes, interludes and postludes. No transcriptions or recordings of authentic duma performance by members of the Chernihiv tradition have come down to us. Discussion regarding other traditions of duma recitations have shown a significant amount of contamination in the 20th century from non-traditional sources which has rendered many of their recordings atypical and unauthentic according to the traditional style in which the kobzari performed dumy.

Life Clampitt was born on June 15, 1920, of Quaker parents, and brought up in New Providence, Iowa. In the American Academy of Arts and Letters and at nearby Grinnell College she began a study of English literature that eventually led her to poetry. She graduated from Grinnell College, and from that time on lived mainly in New York City. To support herself, she worked as a secretary at the Oxford University Press, a reference librarian at the Audubon Society, and a freelance editor. Not until the mid-1960s, when she was in her forties, did she return to writing poetry. Her first poem was published by The New Yorker in 1978. In 1983, at the age of sixty-three, she published her first full-length collection, The Kingfisher. In the decade that followed, Clampitt published five books of poetry, including What the Light Was Like (1985), Archaic Figure (1987), and Westward (1990). Her last book, A Silence Opens, appeared in 1994. She also published a book of essays and several privately printed editions of her longer poems. She taught at the College of William and Mary, Smith College, and Amherst College, but it was her time spent in Manhattan, in a remote part of Maine, and on various trips to Europe, the former Soviet Union, Iowa, Wales, and England that most directly influenced her work. Clampitt was the recipient of a 1982 Guggenheim Fellowship, a MacArthur Fellowship (1992), and she was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Poets. She died of cancer in September 1994.  Awards  Clampitt earned a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992 for her writing. She was also awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts, US and Canada, in 1982, under the poetry category.

The area code was created in October 1947, along with area code 715, as one of the two original area codes assigned to Wisconsin. The numbering plan area (NPA) originally included most of the southern and northeastern parts of Wisconsin, stretching from Lake Michigan to the Minnesota and Iowa borders. 715, then as now, covered the remaining northwestern part. The numbering plan area was first split in 1955, when much of the western portion, including Madison, received area code 608. This configuration remained in place until July 26, 1997, when the northern half, including Green Bay and the Fox River Valley, became numbering plan area 920. The creation of 920 was intended as a long-term solution, but within a year 414 was close to exhaustion once again due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. In 1998, the North American Numbering Plan Administration assigned area code 262 as a second area code for southeastern Wisconsin. The initial proposal called for 262 to be an overlay for the 414 territory. However, overlays were a new concept at the time, and met with considerable resistance due to the requirement for ten-digit dialing. As a result, effective September 25, 1999, the new area code was implemented as a geographic split, with nearly all of the old 414 territory outside of Milwaukee County transferring to 262. Today, area code 414 covers all of Milwaukee County, including the city of Milwaukee. It also serves slivers of Waukesha County, including portions of Muskego and Brookfield, as well as the industrial \\"Ambrosia triangle\\" which is within the Milwaukee city limits. The Milwaukee portion of Washington County, mostly an industrial area, also stayed in 414 after the split. Milwaukee is the center of one of the largest toll-free calling zones in the country. No long-distance charges are applied from one portion of the 414 territory to another; portions of the 262 territory, such as Racine, Waukesha, and Menomonee Falls, are a local call to and from Milwaukee as well.Local calling guide: Milwaukee Zone 1, WI Area code 414 is one of only a few urbanized area codes without an overlay; only seven digits are needed when dialing local calls within the county. This makes Milwaukee one of the largest cities where seven-digit dialing is still possible. Under current projections, it will stay that way for the foreseeable future; the latest projections did not list an exhaust date for 414. The area code gained infamy in 1983, when a gang of six Milwaukee-area teenagers, calling themselves The 414s, broke into several high-profile computer systems across the United States and Canada. The City of Milwaukee started celebrating Milwaukee Day in 2009. It is celebrated on April 14, or 4-14, in honor of Milwaukee's area code. The Milwaukee Bucks' new arena, Fiserv Forum, was nicknamed the \\"Four-One-Forum\\" by fans in an homage to the area code.

It lies in the Salton basin. The desert contains areas of sparse vegetation and has notable areas of sand dunes. With an average rainfall less than each year, this is among the harshest deserts in North America. Human presence is sparse throughout, the largest city being Yuma, Arizona, on the Colorado River and the border of California. Overview The desert includes the lower-elevation parts of the southwestern corner of Arizona, extending west to the Colorado River. On the other side of the river, in California, is the Colorado Desert region of the Sonoran Desert, also referred to as the Low Desert. Although the two regions are separated only by the Colorado River, numerous species of plant and animals live only on one side or the other, such as saguaro cactus, which occurs only east of the river. The Yuma Desert also includes the sandy plains of western Sonora, going all the way to the head of the Gulf of California, then an inland strip reaching into the central Sonoran interior. The most significant river in this desert is the Gila River of Arizona. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is located in this desert, as are the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge. To the south of Arizona's Yuma Desert, in northern Mexico, is the Pinacate volcanic field and biosphere reserve, part of the Gran Desierto de Altar, which is the southern extension of the Yuma Desert. It is on the northwestern foothills of Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental, the western mountain cordillera.  Flora  Agave deserti, a plant native to the Yuma Desert Vegetation is dominated by the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), which is widespread. The saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) and the ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens) are common on the bajadas, while many of the desert trees found are restricted to dry watercourses; these include paloverde (Parkinsonia), the desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), desert ironwood (Olneya tesota), and smoke trees (Psorothamnus spinosus).

The term ye√≠smo comes from the Spanish name of the letter (ye\\"La \\"i griega\\" se llamar√° \\"ye\\"\\" Cuba Debate. 2010-11-05. Retrieved 25 November 2010.). Now, over 90% of Spanish dialects exhibit this phonemic merger. Similar mergers exist in other languages, such as French, Italian, Hungarian, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese or Galician, with different social considerations. Occasionally, the term lle√≠smo () has been used to refer to the maintenance of the phonemic distinction between (spelled \\"y\\") and (spelled \\"ll\\"). Pronunciation Regions with the merger (ye√≠smo) in dark blue, regions with distinction in pink Most dialects that merge the two sounds represented by and realize the remaining sound as a voiced palatal fricative , which is similar to the in English your, but it sometimes sounds like in English jar, especially after or or at the beginning of a word. For example, relleno is pronounced and conllevar is pronounced or . =Zhe√≠smo and she√≠smo= In most of Argentina and Uruguay, the merged sound is pronounced as a sibilant ; this is referred to as zhe√≠smo. In Buenos Aires, the sound has recently been devoiced to (she√≠smo) among younger speakers. Rioplatense does not, however, use the sibilant sound for word-initial (spelt hi- + vowel). Therefore hierro is distinct from yerro . These two words are merged in most other varieties of Spanish. The same shift from to to (to modern ) historically occurred in the development of Old Spanish; this accounts for such pairings as Spanish mujer vs Portuguese mulher, ojo vs olho, hija vs filha and so on.  Extension of ye√≠smo  Currently, the highlands of Colombia are shifting to ye√≠smo with older people being the only keeping the distinction, which is completely lost in people born in the 1980s onwards. The distinction between and remains in the Philippines, Ecuadorian highlands, Andean Peru, Paraguay, Bolivia, and the northeastern portions of Argentina that border with Paraguay. The distinction is more common in areas with a common bilingualism with indigenous languages, such as Aymara, Quechua, and Guaran√≠. In Spain, most of the northern half of the country and several areas in the south used to retain the distinction, but ye√≠smo has spread throughout the country, and the distinction is now lost in most of Spain, particularly outside areas with linguistic contact with Catalan and Basque. Minimal pairs Ye√≠smo produces homophony in a number of cases. For example, the following word pairs sound the same to speakers of dialects with ye√≠smo, but they would be minimal pairs in regions with distinction: *haya (\\"beech tree\\" / \\"that there be\\") ~ halla (\\"s/he finds\\") *cay√≥ (\\"s/he fell\\") ~ call√≥ (\\"s/he became silent\\") *hoya (\\"pit, hole\\") ~ olla (\\"pot\\") *baya (\\"berry\\") / vaya (\\"that he go\\") ~ valla (\\"fence\\") The relatively low frequency of both and makes confusion unlikely. However, orthographic mistakes are common (for example, writing llendo instead of yendo). A notable case is the name of the island of Mallorca: since Mallorcans tend to pronounce intervocalic / é/ as /j/, central Catalan scribes assumed the authentic (and correct) name Maiorca was another case of this and hypercorrected it to Mallorca.

Among the members of the jury were such artists as Alexandre Tansman, Antonio Lauro and Maria Luisa Anido. Before that he studied with such guitarist as Milan Zelenka and ≈†tƒõp√°n Rak in Prague. In 1987 he decided to emigrate to the Netherlands where after years of studying and getting inspiration from many different artists he has created his own style which is not ignoring authentic way of interpretation 19th-century guitar literature on periodic instruments and going far to some world music elements. Pavel Steidl also composes himself and his own compositions are often played on his concerts. He played in more than 40 countries of the world from among Canada, USA, China, India, Japan, Europe, South and Central America and many others. On demand of Italian Guitar Magazine Guitart the readers decided to choose him as a guitar player of the year 2004 . Pavel Steidl plays many instruments, but mainly Francisco Simplicio (1926) and Franz Butcher (2008), romantic guitar: copies of J.G.Stauffer guitar made by B.Kresse and original instrument from the beginning of the 19th century Nikolaus G.Ries cca. 1830 In his teaching, Pavel's approach is encouraging but subtle. For, as he says, \\"the teacher is not allowed to say everything. [...] I let them play one piece. Each note twice, one staccato, one tenuto, to show what you can do. The possibilities: that's what I like very much. I don't like to write piano, forte, tenuto. I don't like metronomes.\\" Steidl is known for using overtone singing in some works, such as Domeniconi's Hommage √† Jimi Hendrix, op. 52. Facial Gestures Pavel Steidl often uses unique gestures during his performances (both facial gestures, and motions with hands and body). = Perception= Some people feel that Steidl's gestures give an additional dimension to his playing, e.g. showing his expressive involvement in the music, being a personal way of helping his phrasing become lyrical (with voice-gestures - using the guitar, but \\"expressing like a singer\\"), serving to underline certain melodies and their character, or hinting at crescendo in held chords (even though the strings' vibrations are getting softer), expressing fun/joy, entertaining, etc. RecordingsLuigi Legnani - 36 caprices op. 20, Fantasia op. 19 - Naxos 1998 / Cat.8.554198 *Napoleon Coste - Guitar Music Vol.3 - Naxos 2000 / Cat.8.554353 *N.

It forms within the Cordillera Central mountain range southwest of the city of Bonao and passes through the fertile Cibao Valley. The river from there turns north-northeast passing the city of Bonao along the way. Southwest of Cotu√≠, the river reaches Hatillo Dam (Spanish: Presa de Hatillo) before turning northeast then east as it reaches its mouth at the Saman√° Bay in the northeast part of the Dominican Republic. Like many rivers in the Dominican Republic, the name is derived from the Ta√≠no language. Course The source of the Yuna is located southeast of the city of Santiago and northwest of the city of Santo Domingo. The source is located near the southern Monse√±or Nouel village of La Cuesta de la Vaca within the municipality of Bonao on Cerro Montoso Hill (Spanish: Loma de Cerro Montoso) at an elevation of above sea level. The Cerro Montoso Hill lies along the highest mountain range in the West Indies, the Cordillera Central. The Cordillera Central provides the principal watershed and drainage divide for the Dominican Republic; the Yuna has its source along the northern slope of the mountain range. The Yuna descends from its headwaters running south then west where several streams feed into the river near the San Jos√© de Ocoa province border. The Yuna then turns north near the village of El Torito passing through several mountains including Torito Hill (Spanish: La Loma del Torito), and Middle Hill (Spanish: La Loma El Medio). The Yuna shifts north- northwest near the Middle Hill passing through several villages including Pino de Yuna, Piedra de los Veganos, and El Capa. The Yuna next flows into the village of Los Finitos where it travels in a more northerly course. The river then receives two tributaries along its left bank: the Blanco and Tireo River. The Yuna then heads northeast into lower elevations as the river leaves the Cordillera Central. The river passes through the village of Los Quemados, receiving several forks that originate within the Cordillera Central to the west. The river next bypasses Bonao to the northwest of the city. The Yuna then flows into the town of Los Arroces, receiving a major tributary, the Masopedro River, on the left bank. The Yuna then heads east passing under the Autopista Duarte before entering another mountainous region of Monse√±or Nouel. The Yuna next passes north of Falconbridge Ltd., a major economic income for the Bonao area. The Yuna heads east as it cuts through several mountains in this region including the Flat Hill (Spanish: La Loma del Llano) where the Yujo River converges onto the Yuna. The river accompanies the S√°nchez Ram√≠rez Province line east of Flat Hill and enters the province upon arriving at Lake Hatillo (Spanish: Presa de Hatillo) in the municipality of Cotu√≠ where it joins the Maim√≥n River. Lake Hatillo runs north-northeast for and has a total area of from the Yuna‚ÄìMaim√≥n convergence to a hydroelectric dam located southwest of Cotu√≠. The reservoir, surrounded by rolling hills, is the largest artificial lake and is home to the largest dam in the Caribbean. The Hatillo dam in the Yuna River is an example of a dam with flood control purposes.Laboy-Nieves Eddie N., Fred C. Schaffner, Ahmed Abdelhadi, and Mattheus F.A. Goosen (2008). Environmental Management, Sustainable Development and Human Health. CRC Press, 548. The Yuna continues past the dam running northeast while decreasing in elevation and receiving first the Maguaca River and later the Chacuey River along the right bank. The Yuna bypasses the city of Cotu√≠ to the north and enters a S√°nchez Ram√≠rez region filled with cocoa orchards. The Yuna receives its principal tributary, the Cam√∫ River, approximately northeast of Cotu√≠ at the Duarte Province line at an elevation of above sea level. The Cam√∫ River has its source within the Cordillera Central and has a watershed that spans seven provinces: La Vega, Santiago, Monse√±or Nouel, Hermanas Mirabal, S√°nchez Ram√≠rez, and Duarte. The Yuna turns east after receiving the Cam√∫ River along its left bank and now serves as the S√°nchez Ram√≠rez-Duarte Province line, heading into wetlands filled with rice and cocoa cultivation. The easternmost segment of the Yuna past the mouth of the Cam√∫ River has the most s-shaped curves of any segment in its course. The Yuna continues to decrease in elevation as it heads east reaching above sea level upon entering Duarte Province and the municipality of Eugenio Maria de Hostos where it meets two small tributaries along its left bank: the Nigua and Yaiba Rivers. The Yuna next heads into the municipality of Villa Riva running east-northeast while descending into elevations of above sea level. The Yuna passes north of Los Haitises National Park where it meets the Cevicos River along its right bank. The Yuna then traverses a region with several lagoons and wetlands and heads north to the town of Villa Riva before turning southeast and receiving the Payabo River on its right bank. The Yuna next passes beneath Autopista Juan Pablo II upon briefly entering the municipality of Arenoso and continues east passing several small villages including Los Coles and Agua Santa del Yuna. The Yuna continues east into the village of Los Cacaos where the Yuna serves as the Duarte‚ÄìSaman√° Province line in a region filled with marshlands and cienegas. The Yuna next arrives at the long Barracote River which separates from the right bank of the Yuna. The Barracote runs southeast-east as it reaches its mouth at the Saman√° Bay (Spanish: Bah√≠a de Saman√°) in the municipality of S√°nchez at an elevation of above sea level. The main branch of the Yuna continues northeast receiving the Guayabo River on its left bank before traveling east into Saman√° Province. The Yuna finally reaches its delta within Los Haitises National Park approximately south of the city of S√°nchez and north of the Barracote River mouth. The delta is located within the Lower Yuna Mangroves (Spanish: Manglares del Bajo Yuna) and empties into the Saman√° Bay., which is one of the largest estuaries in the Caribbean.Dominican Republic: Samana Bay.

History  This objection to the Doomsday Argument (DA), originally by Dennis Dieks (1992), developed by Bartha & Hitchcock (1999), and expanded by Ken Olum (2001), is that the possibility of an individual existing all depends on how many humans will ever exist (N). If N is big, then the chance of said individual existing is higher than if only a few humans will ever exist. If the individual does exist, this is evidence that N is high. The argument is sometimes expressed in an alternative way by having the posterior marginal distribution of n based on N without explicitly invoking a non-zero chance of existing. The Bayesian inference mathematics are identical. The name for this attack within the DA community is the \\"Self- Indication Assumption\\" (SIA), proposed by one of its opponents, the DA- advocate Nick Bostrom. His (2000) definition reads: :SIA: Given the fact that people exist, people should (other things equal) favor hypotheses according to which many observers exist over hypotheses on which few observers exist. A development of Dieks's original paper by Kopf, Krtous and Page (1994), showed that the SIA precisely cancels out the effect of the Doomsday Argument, and therefore, one's birth position (n) gives no information about the total number of humans that will exist (N). This conclusion of SIA is uncontroversial with modern DA-proponents, who instead question the validity of the assumption itself, not the conclusion which would follow, if the SIA were true.  The Bayesian inference of N from n under the SIA  The SIA- mathematics considers the chance of being the nth human as being conditioned on the joint probability of two separate events, both of which must be true: #Being born: With marginal probability P(b). #Being nth in line: With marginal probability (1/N), under the Principle of indifference. This means that the pdf for n, is concentrated at P(n = 0) = 1 - P(b), and that for P(n > 0) the marginal distribution can be calculated from the conditional: :P(n \\\\mid N) = \\\\frac{P(b \\\\mid N)}{N} Where n > 0 J. Richard Gott's DA could be formulated similarly up to this point, where it has P(b  N) = P(b) = 1, producing Gott's inference of n from N. However, Dennis Dieks argues that P(b) < 1, and that P(b  N) rises proportionally in N (which is a SIA). This can be expressed mathematically: :P(b \\\\mid N) = \\\\frac{N}{c} Where c is a constant. The SIA‚Äôs effect was expressed by Page et al. as Assumption 2 for the prior probability distribution, P(N): : \\"The probability for the observer to exist somewhere in a history of length N is proportional to the probability for that history and to the number of people in that history.\\" (1994 - Emphasis added to: ) They note that similar assumptions had been dismissed by Leslie on the grounds that: \\"it seems wrong to treat ourselves as if we were once immaterial souls harbouring hopes of becoming embodied, hopes that would have been greater, the greater the number of bodies to be created.\\" (1992) One argument given for P(b  N) rising in N that does not create Leslie‚Äôs ‚Äúimmaterial souls‚Äù is the possibility of being born into any of a large number of universes within a multiverse. A person can only be born into one, so the indifference principle within this (humans-across-universes) reference class would mean that the chance of being born into a particular universe is proportional to its weight in humans, N. (Echoing the weak anthropic principle.) :In this framework, the chance of 'not being born' is zero, but the chance of 'not being born into this universe' is non-zero. Whatever the reasoning, the essential idea of the Self-Indication Assumption is that the prior probability of birth into this universe is rising in N, and is generally considered to be proportional to N. (The following discussion assumes they are proportional so P(b  N) = 2 P(b  2N), since other functions increasing in N produce similar results.) Therefore: :P(n \\\\mid N) = \\\\frac{1}{c} Where n > 0 = Effect of the ‚Äúunborn‚Äù on the Bayesian inference = To clarify the exposition, Gott‚Äôs vague prior N distribution is ‚Äòcapped‚Äô at some ‚Äúuniversal carrying capacity‚Äù, \\\\Omega. (This prevents N‚Äôs distribution being an improper prior.) \\\\Omega is the largest possible value for N if all living space in the 'universe' is consumed. The \\\\Omega limit has no specified upper bounds (to habitable planets in the Galaxy, say) but makes N‚Äôs posterior distribution more tractable: : P(N) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1}{N \\\\ln(\\\\Omega) }, \\\\;\\\\; N \\\\le \\\\Omega \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, \\\\;\\\\; N > \\\\Omega \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. The \\\\ln(\\\\Omega) factor normalizes the N‚Äôs probability, allowing calculation of the marginal P(n > 0) by integration of P(bN) across the [1, \\\\Omega] range of possible N: :P(n) = \\\\int_{N=n}^{\\\\Omega} P(n \\\\mid N)P(N) \\\\,dN = \\\\int_{n}^{\\\\Omega} \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\right] \\\\frac{1}{N \\\\ln(\\\\Omega) } \\\\,dN This range starts at n rather than 1, because n can‚Äôt be greater than N. It uses the calculation above for n‚Äôs distribution given N, and implies: :P(n) = \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{ n} \\\\right) \\\\frac { 1}{ \\\\ln(\\\\Omega) c } Substituting these marginals into the conditional equation (assuming N below \\\\Omega) gives: :P(N \\\\mid n) = \\\\frac{ P(n \\\\mid N)P(N) }{P(n)} = \\\\frac{ 1}{c} \\\\frac{1}{N \\\\ln(\\\\Omega) } \\\\frac { \\\\ln(\\\\Omega) c }{\\\\ln(\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{ n} ) } = \\\\frac{1}{N \\\\ln(\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{ n} ) } = The probabilistic bounds on N with the SIA = The chance of doomsday before an arbitrary factor of the current population, x, is born can be inferred, by integrating the chance of N having any value above xn. (Normally x = 20.) :P((N > xn)\\\\mid n) = \\\\int_{xn}^{\\\\Omega} \\\\frac{1}{N \\\\ln(\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{ n} ) } \\\\,dN = \\\\frac{ \\\\ln(\\\\Omega)-\\\\ln(xn) }{ \\\\ln(\\\\Omega) - \\\\ln(n) } Therefore, given the posterior information that we have been born and that we are nth in line: For any factor, x << (\\\\Omega / n), of the current population: :\\\\lim_{\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\infty} P(N <= xn) = 0 :Conclusion: n provides no information about N, in an unbounded vague prior SIA universe.  Significance of Omega  rightframeFigure A: The probability of reaching One Trillion people from the current (60 billion) count under the SIA, against different theoretical maxima for N. (The x-axis is the finite maximum number of people that can ever be born into the universe - the upper limit of N - plotted on a log scale.) Note that the carrying capacity is the maximum number of people in any potential universe, not just this one, but even on Earth the maximum number of people that sunlight can simultaneously support has been estimated (e.g. by Isaac Asimov) at over a trillion; extending this for a million generations gives an upper limit over a quintillion on just this planet, and a septillion if humanity colonizes fewer than 0.001% of the galaxy's stars with similar efficiency. Under the SIA, as the potential size of N increases, the significance of the current number of births (n) decreases, to the point that this posterior information does not constrain the actual value of N at all. The finite \\\\Omega is essential to this solution in order to produce finite integrals. In a bounded universe, \\\\Omega actually must be finite, although this is not usually an argument used by those proposing the SIA rebuttal. However, other proponents of indefinite survival of human (and posthuman) intelligence have postulated a finite endpoint, as the (extremely high) ‚ÄúOmega‚Äù. Specifying any finite upper limit, \\\\Omega, was not a part of Dieks's argument, and critics of the SIA have argued that an infinite upper bound on N creates an Improper integral (or summation) in the bayesian inference on N, which is a challenge to the logic of the critique. (For example Eastmond, and Bostrom, who argues that if the SIA cannot rule out an infinite number of potential humans, it is fatally flawed.) The unbounded vague prior is scale invariant, in that the mean is arbitrary. Therefore no finite value can be selected with more than a 50% chance of being above N (the marginal distribution of N). Olum's critique depends on such a limit existing; without this his critique is technically not applicable. Therefore it must be cautioned that the simplification here (to bound N's distribution at \\\\Omega) omits a significant hurdle to the credibility of the Self-Indication Assumption Doomsday argument rebuttal.  Remarks  Many people, (such as Bostrom) believe the leading candidate for Doomsday argument refutation is a Self-Indication Assumption of some kind. It is popular partly because it is a purely Bayesian argument which accepts some of the DA's premises (such as the Indifference and Copernican principles). Other observations: * The joint prior distribution, P(nN), can be manipulated to produce a wide range of links between n and N by defining various birth probabilities given N. Since this distribution must be assumed prior to evidence, any particular choice of P(bN) is faith-based. Many writers feel a joint distribution with no link N to n is more natural than the strong link given by the vague prior, making the DA \\"Irrelevant\\" (Page et al.) Others, such as Gott feel the opposite, and are more comfortable using the pure vague prior as the prior joint probability, with P(bN) = 1 at all N. * The SIA rebuttal is a very special form of the \\"a priori\\" rebuttal of the DA, and differs from that approach in being purely statistical. * If the SIA is true then the mere fact of existence leads credence to \\"any\\" theory that postulates a \\"high\\" number of conscious beings in the universe, and controversially implies that a theory which does not is unlikely to be true. (For instance, the SIA implies that N is likely to be very high, so the probability of an upcoming Armageddon is correspondingly low, which makes the Doomsday clock‚Äôs warning of relatively imminent destruction a mistake.) Under the Self-Indication Assumption the 'reference class' of which we are part includes a potentially vast number of the unborn (at least into this universe). In order to overturn the conventional DA calculation so completely the reservoir of souls (potential births) in the reference class must be astoundingly large. For instance, the certain-birth DA estimates the chance of reaching the trillionth (10^{12}th) birth at around 5%; to shift this probability above 90% the SIA requires a potential number of humans (\\\\Omega) in the order of 10^{24} (a septillion births). This might be feasible physically, and is also possible within the conventional DA model (though staggeringly unlikely). However, the SIA differs from the normal DA in having the reference class include all septillion unborn potential-humans at this point in history, when only sixty billion have been born. Including unborn people in the reference class we sample from means including in the reference class things for which we can never have any evidence. This puts the SIA at odds with philosophical approaches requiring strictly falsifiable constructs, such as Logical positivism.  SIA Intuition: the lost-property metaphor  It can be hard to visualize how the Self-Indication Assumption changes the distribution because everyday cases where a null result can be returned don't change the statistics significantly. The following two examples of estimating the size of a darkened space show how the probability shift can occur: * Cloak-room case: Consider a situation where someone is looking for their coat in a dark room and finding it one foot from the door; the Bayesian inference from a vague prior is that the room is less than 20 feet long (with 95% confidence). * Lost-property case: A person's lost coat has been filed somewhere in a huge lost-property warehouse, and as they search through its many aisles they see that they are all filled to capacity with belongings, and are various lengths. The aisle lengths are distributed according to the vague prior, except that none are more than 100 feet long. Finally, they find their coat one foot into a dark aisle, and wonder whether that aisle is more than twenty feet long. The Bayesian inference shifts from the cloak-room case to the lost-property case, because of the chance that the coat would not be found in the aisle it was found in, and some estimate of the aisle's dimensions. Using the SIA Bayesian inference equation with \\\\Omega = 100, n = 1, x = 20 gives the chance that the aisle is above 20 feet long in the Lost-property case: * Cloak-room case: The confidence that the room is shorter than 20 feet long given the position of the coat = 95% * Lost-property case: The confidence that the aisle is less than 20 feet long given exactly the same information about the coat's position in it = 65% The confidence that the unseen space is longer than 20 feet is directly analogous to the confidence that the human race will become more than 20 times as numerous as it has been. Using an \\\\Omega of one hundred times the current value only increases the subjective chance seven times (from 5% to 35%), but this is a very small limit for the purposes of exposition.  Problems with the SIA  The SIA is not an assumption or axiom of Dieks' system. In fact, as stated, the negation of the SIA is a theorem of Dieks' system. A proposition similar to the SIA can be derived from Dieks' system, but it is necessary to revise the SIA to limit it to situations where a person doesn't know the date or their birth order number. Even this related proposition is not an axiom of Dieks. It is a theorem, derived from other fundamental assumptions. In Dieks, they may never have been born and the end of the human race is independent of their birth order number. A proposition related to the SIA, but not the SIA itself, can be derived from these assumptions. Hence, no one assumes the SIA. It should be called the Self-Indication Corollary, perhaps.  SIA's own doomsday argument  Katja Grace argues that while SIA overcomes the standard doomsday argument, when combined with an assumption of a Great Filter, SIA leads to another kind of doomsday prediction. The reasoning is as follows. In some worlds, the filter may be early‚Äîsome time before the advent of a technological civilization like ours. In other worlds, the filter may be late‚Äîbetween the advent of technological civilization and galactic colonization. Collectively, the worlds with mostly late filters have many more instances of life at the human level of development, so SIA, together with the knowledge that we are at the human-level stage, implies we're probably in one of the worlds with a late filter. In other words, the risk of extinction is higher than we would have naively supposed.

Early life Born in 1866, Jensen was the son of a knife grinder in the town of Raadvad just to the north of Copenhagen. Jensen began his training in goldsmithing at the age of 14 in Copenhagen. His apprenticeship with the firm Guldsmed Andersen, ended in 1884, and this freed Georg to follow his artistic interests. From childhood, Jensen had longed to be a sculptor and he was now able to pursue this course of study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. He graduated in 1892 and began exhibiting his work. Although his clay sculptures was well received, making a living as a fine artist proved difficult and he turned his hand to the applied arts. First as a modeller at the Bing & Gr√∏ndahl porcelain factory and, beginning in 1898, with a small pottery workshop he founded in partnership with Christian Petersen. Again the work was well received, but the sales were not strong enough to support Jensen, now a widower, and his two young sons. Career Georg Jensen in his workshop in Copenhagen, 1906 A Georg Jensen shop at Str√∏get, Copenhagen In 1901, Jensen abandoned ceramics and began again as a silversmith and designer with the master, Mogens Ballin. This led Jensen to make a landmark decision, when in 1904, he risked what small capital he had and opened his own little silversmithy at 36 Bredgade in Copenhagen. Jensen's training in metalsmithing along with his education in the fine arts allowed him to combine the two disciplines and revive the tradition of the artist craftsman. Soon, the beauty and quality of his Art Nouveau creations caught the eye of the public and his success was assured. The Copenhagen quarters were greatly expanded and before the end of the 1920s, Jensen had opened retail in Berlin (1909), London (1921), and New York (1924).. Jewelry Jensen made his first piece of jewelry in 1899, a silver and silver and gilt \\"Adam and Eve\\" belt buckle. Museum collections and exhibitions During his lifetime, Jensen's work was collected by museums including the Danish Museum for Decorative Art and the Museum Folkwang. In 2005 the Bard Graduate Center in New York presented an exhibition entitled, '' Georg Jensen Jewelry.  Georg Jensen brand signs When he was twenty Georg Jensen signed his first sculpture with \\"My Father\\" (1887). In 1894 he used the markings GJ as brandsign and from 1899 he often used GJ. In most cases the year was put next to the brand sign. =Brand signs of Georg Jensen= thumbleft300px 1\\\\. Used from 1904 - 1908 2\\\\. Used from 1909 - 1914 3\\\\. Used from 1910 - 1925 4\\\\.

The neurula stage is preceded by the gastrula stage; consequentially, neurulation is preceded by gastrulation. Neurulation marks the beginning of the process of organogenesis. Mice, chicks, and frogs are common experimental models for studying the neurula. Depending on the species, embryos reach the neurula stage at different time points and spend a varying amount of time in this stage. For oviparous organisms, incubation temperature also affects the length of neurulation. In addition to development of the neural tube, other processes occur in a neurula stage embryo depending on the species. For example, in reptiles, extra-embryonic membrane tissues become distinct from the embryo. The neurula embryo has five regions of mesoderm that surround the neural tube. Anterior mesoderm develops into the head region, while posterior mesoderm develops into the trunk. Various molecules, including proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix, and genes, including Pax transcription factors, are essential for the development and closure of the neural tube in the neurula stage embryo.  Neurulation  Neurulation is a process in vertebrate embryos at the neurula stage in which the neural tube is formed. There are two types of neurulation: primary and secondary neurulation. Primary neurulation refers to the formation and inward folding of the neural plate upon itself to form the neural tube. In secondary neurulation, the neural tube forms via the merging of cavities in the medullary cord. In amphibians and reptiles, primary neurulation forms the whole neural tube, and the neural tube closes simultaneously along its length. Contrarily, in fish, secondary neurulation forms the neural tube. Both primary and secondary neurulation occur in birds and mammals, although with slight differences. Primary neurulation occurs in the cranial and upper spinal regions, which gives rise to the brain and upper regions of the spinal cord. Secondary neurulation occurs in the lower sacral and caudal regions, resulting in the formation of the lower regions of the spinal cord. In birds, the neural tube closes anterior to posterior, while in mammals, the middle closes first, followed by the closure of both ends.  Developmental timing  The point at which the embryo reaches the neurula stage differs among species, while for oviparous organisms, the length of neurulation is additionally affected by incubation temperature. In general, the lower the temperature, the greater the length of neurulation. Chick embryos reach the neurula stage on day 2 post-fertilization, and they undergo neurulation up to day 5. Reptiles, including crocodiles, lizards, and turtles, tend to spend a longer time in the neurula stage. A typical frog embryo, incubated at 18 ¬∞C, is an early stage neurula by 50 hours post-fertilization and a late stage neurula by 67 hours.Hill, M.A. (2018, November 30) Embryology Frog Development. Retrieved from https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Frog_Development. The mouse embryo begins neurulation on day 7.5 of gestation and remains in the neurula stage until day 9.Hill, M.A. (2018, November 30) Embryology Mouse Timeline Detailed. Retrieved from https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Mouse_Timeline_Detailed.  Morphology  The mesoderm of a vertebrate embryo in the neurula stage can be divided into five regions. Ventral to the neural tube is the chordamesoderm. Lateral to either side of the neural tube is the paraxial mesoderm, while the intermediate lateral region to the neural tube is the intermediate mesoderm. The fourth region is the lateral plate mesoderm, and the last region is the head mesenchym. Anterior portions of the mesoderm develop into rostral regions of an organism, such as the head, while posterior mesoderm develops into caudal regions, such as the trunk or tail. The paraxial mesoderm, also termed somitic mesoderm, develops into somites, blocks of tissue that occur in a segmental pattern. Somites, in turn, give rise to vertebrae, ribs, skeletal muscle, cartilage, tendons, and skin.Larsen, William J. (2001). Human embryology (3. ed.). Philadelphia, Pa.: Churchill Livingstone. pp. 53‚Äì86. . Transition from the gastrula stage to the neurula stage In Xenopus laevis, the transition from the gastrula to the neurula involves morphological changes in two regions surrounding the blastopore: the dorsal involuting marginal zone (IMZ) and the overlying non-involuting marginal zone (NIMZ) of the gastrula. Following involution at the mid-gastrula stage, the IMZ undergoes convergent extension, in which the lateral regions narrow and move towards the midline and the anterior end lengthens. This has the effect of narrowing the blastopore. The NIMZ, which does not involute, simultaneously extends in the opposite direction and at a greater rate to cover regions no longer occupied by the IMZ. The convergent extension of the IMZ and NIMZ begins in the second half of gastrulation and continues into the late neurula stage. Eventually, deep tissue of the IMZ forms the central notochord and the surrounding paraxial mesoderm. By the early neurula stage, the notochord is clearly distinguished. Notochordal cells become arranged in a formation representing a stack of coins in a process termed circumferential intercalation. The superficial layer of the IMZ develops into the roof of the archenteron, or the primitive gut, while the underlying endoderm forms the archenteron floor. The NIMZ develops into a structure resembling the early neural tube. The outer ectodermal layer of the neurula is formed by uniform expansion of the cells at the animal pole, known as the animal cap. The ectoderm then differentiates into neural and epidermal tissue.Keller, R. E., Danilchik, M., Gimlich, R., & Shih, J. (1985). \\"The function and mechanism of convergent extension during gastrulation of Xenopus laevis\\" (PDF). Development, 89(Supplement), 185-209. In reptilian embryos, beginning in the late-stage neurula and carrying over into the early stages of organogenesis, extra-embryonic membrane tissues comprising the yolk sac, chorion, and amnion become distinct from the tissues of the embryo. The mesoderm splits to create the extra-embryonic coelom, which consists of two layers. The vascularized mesoderm-endoderm inner layer, termed the splanchnopleure, develops into the yolk sac, while the nonvascularized ectoderm-mesoderm outer layer, termed the somatopleure, becomes the amnion and chorion. During organogenesis, these three extra-embryonic tissues become fully developed. Additionally, within the reptilian neurula, tissues of the brain begin to differentiate and the heart and blood vessels start to form.  Chemical composition  Mouse neurula tissues divide rapidly, with an average cell cycle lasting 8‚Äì10 hours. Proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of neurula-stage cells play an important role in promoting functional cranial neurulation and neural fold elevation; hyaluronic acid (HA) is synthesized and becomes accumulated, while the cell maintains a low level of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). HA is involved in creation of biconvex neural folds, while sulfated GAGs are critical in manipulating the neural groove into a V-shape, as well as in neural tube closure. The ECM does not play a major role in spinal neurulation due to the close-packed nature of the mesodermal cells in the spinal region, which allows little intercellular space. Additionally, actin-containing microfilaments are believed to be necessary in cranial neurulation. They may act as the mechanism for neural folding, or they may stabilize neural folds that have already formed; however, their exact role has not been determined. There is some evidence that growth factors, such as insulin or transferrin, also play a role in neurulation, but this link has not been well-studied.  Gene activation  A variety of genes have been found to be expressed in the neurula stage embryo. Different genes are activated for different neurulation events, such as those occurring in separate regions of the developing neural tube. These genes are necessary for proper neurulation and closure of the neural tube. Signaling molecules such as Wnts, FGFs, and BMFs along with the transcription factors that include Msx, Snails, Sox8/9/10, and Pax3/7 genes play key roles in neural crest formation. Pax transcriptional factors have an important role in early development, especially with regards to the CNS and neural crest. Pax3 and Pax7 are promoters of both neural crest cell survival along with promoting environmental stress resistance. In mouse embryos Pax3 blocks the tumor suppressor gene p53, which is necessary for controlled proliferation and genomic stability, is expressed in all cells of the neurula. During early development Pax3 is expressed at the posterior and lateral area of the neural plate, the same region that the neural crest arises from. Neural crest defects were found to occur in mouse and human Pax3 mutants, indicating an importance of functionality. Within chicks, frogs and fish Pax3/Pax7 are activated by Wnt and FGF signaling. Pax3 and Pax7 are also required for neural crest induction after depletion of the two genes resulted in the lack of activation of the specific neural crest genes Snail2 and Foxd3, which didn't allow further development or emigration of neural crest. Using knockouts has been helpful for understanding the role and functions of several genes found in the neurula. For example, Wnt-1 was found to have no role in the closing of the neural plate, despite being present at the tip of the neural folds when it is closing. Though mutants of Wnt-1 does lead to pattern defects within the brain. Notch1 is involved with formation of somites. HNF-3 is needed for development of the notochord and node. The gene Apolipoprotein B, which is involved in transporting and metabolizing fat soluble molecules in the blood, is expressed in the yolk sac and fetal liver. Within the neurula in Xenopus laevis, development genes Xwnt-3 and Xwnt-4 are present.

Another surgery for vasectomy reversal is vasoepididymostomy. History Vasovasostomy is a form of microsurgery first performed by the Australian Surgeon, Dr. Earl Owen (1934-2014) in 1971. Limitations In most cases the vas deferens can be reattached but, in many cases, fertility is not achieved. There are several reasons for this, including blockages in the vas deferens, and the presence of autoantibodies which disrupt normal sperm activity. If blockage at the level of the epididymis is suspected, a vasoepididymostomy can be performed. Return of sperm to the ejaculate depends greatly on the length of time from the vasectomy and the skill of the surgeon. Generally, the shorter the interval, the higher the chance of success. The likelihood of pregnancy can depend on female partner factors. Over half of men who have undergone a vasectomy develop anti-sperm antibodies. The effects of anti-sperm antibodies continue to be debated in the medical literature, but there is agreement that antibodies may reduce sperm motility. Successful vasovasostomy Only two conditions must be satisfied for sperm to be returned to a patient's semen with vasectomy reversal by vasovasostomy. First, the patient must have sperm available to pass through at least one reconnection. The second condition is that each reconnection must be as watertight as possible. The surgeon's goal is to achieve a very precise circumferential reconnection of the sperm canal edges by using meticulously placed microsurgical sutures. Haematoma on penis and scrotum 24 hours after microsurgical vasovasostomy Procedure Vasovasostomy can be performed in the convoluted or straight portion of the vas deferens. Vasovasostomy is typically an out-patient procedure (patient goes home the same day). The procedure is typically performed by urologists. Most urologists specializing in the field of male infertility perform vasovasostomies using an operative microscope for magnification, under general or regional anesthesia. If sperm were seen in one or both vas contents at the time of surgery, or sperm reached the patient's semen only transiently after the reversal, microsurgical vasovasostomy may be successful. Unfortunately, surgeons performing only an occasional vasectomy reversal often neglect examining the vas contents for presence or absence of sperm. A surgeon cannot determine sperm presence or absence by the naked eye. The most common cause for failed vasectomy reversals is the inappropriate non-microsurgical technique using sutures that are too large to achieve watertight reconnections. The failure of a competently performed microsurgical vasovasostomy following the absence of any sperm in the contents of each vas usually is due to ‚Äúblowouts‚Äù in the epididymides. Under these circumstances an operation should be performed only by a micro-surgeon with proven vasoepididymostomy expertise, bypassing the blowouts. Prognosis The prognosis for each patient should be determined by a pre-operative examination of the vasectomy sites and consideration of the time interval since vasectomy. Rate of pregnancy The rate of pregnancy depends on such factors as the method used for the vasectomy and the length of time that has passed since the vasectomy was performed. The reversal procedures are frequently impermanent, with occlusion of the vas recurring two or more years after the operation. The presence of sperm granulomas improves the likelihood of restoring sperm to the semen with a vasovasotomy. A local urologist can easily determine whether you have 0, 1, or 2 sperm granuloma by a painless examination of each vasectomy site. This exam can be fairly inexpensive, if you inform their office in advance that this is the only service you wish and you obtain the cost for only this specific examination. If the interval since your vasectomy is less than fifteen years, your prognosis will be 70% or better and this local examination is probably not needed. A sperm granuloma develops from post- vasectomy sperm leakage and somehow it behaves like a safety valve preventing internal pressure build up and ruptures of the delicate epididymis tubules with subsequent obstructive scarring. Statistics Vasovasostomy can be effective regardless of how long it's been since the original vasectomy. However, if more than 15 years have passed since the original vasectomy, one may have a lower chance of having enough healthy sperm in one's own semen to father a child. Also, the longer the obstructive interval, the more likely it is that a vasoepididymostomy will be required. Costs Typical cost of one vasovasostomy is US$5,000‚Äì15,000 (one side).

Phase synchronisation is usually applied to two waveforms of the same frequency with identical phase angles with each cycle. However it can be applied if there is an integer relationship of frequency, such that the cyclic signals share a repeating sequence of phase angles over consecutive cycles. These integer relationships are called Arnold tongues which follow from bifurcation of the circle map. One example of phase synchronization of multiple oscillators can be seen in the behavior of Southeast Asian fireflies. At dusk, the flies begin to flash periodically with random phases and a gaussian distribution of native frequencies. As night falls, the flies, sensitive to one another's behavior, begin to synchronize their flashing. After some time all the fireflies within a given tree (or even larger area) will begin to flash simultaneously in a burst. Thinking of the fireflies as biological oscillators, we can define the phase to be 0¬∞ during the flash and +-180¬∞ exactly halfway until the next flash. Thus, when they begin to flash in unison, they synchronize in phase. One way to keep a local oscillator \\"phase synchronized\\" with a remote transmitter uses a phase-locked loop.

It travels southeast from downtown Winchester to SR 400 (Washington Street) in downtown Alexandria. Its route largely parallels those of the Washington & Old Dominion Trail (W&OD; Trail) and the Potomac River. Between its western terminus and I-395, SR 7 is part of the National Highway System. In 1968, the Virginia State Highway Commission designated the road as the \\"Harry Flood Byrd Highway\\" between Alexandria and Winchester to commemorate Harry F. Byrd Sr. (1887‚Äì1966). . Route description The west end of SR 7 at US 11/US 522 in Winchester SR 7 begins downtown in the independent city of Winchester, as East Piccadilly Street at an intersection with US Route 11 (US 11) and US 522, and it continues through the east end of the city, along North East Lane, National Avenue, and finally Berryville Avenue. SR 7 exits the city into surrounding Frederick County, where its name changes to Berryville Pike and it becomes a four-lane highway. SR 7 continues across Interstate 81 (I-81) and then into Clarke County. SR 7 enters Clarke County from Frederick County, crossing Opequon Creek, and continues towards the town of Berryville. Business SR 7 (SR 7 Bus.) splits off just west of Berryville and passes through the town, while the main route bypasses the town to the north. Both routes cross US 340, and SR 7 Bus. rejoins SR 7 just east of the town. SR 7 crosses the Shenandoah River and its name changes to the Harry Flood Byrd Highway. SR 7 crosses the Loudoun‚ÄìClarke county line and the Appalachian Trail at the summit of Snickers Gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Snickers Gap, where SR 7 leaves Loudoun County and enters Clarke County; the route peaks here before descending into the Shenandoah Valley SR 7 enters the rural western part of Loudoun County as the Harry Flood Byrd Highway at Snickers Gap, and then it descends out of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It intersects the northern end of the Snickersville Turnpike, and then it passes just north of the village of Bluemont (formerly Snickersville). Next SR 7 curves just south of Jefferson County, West Virginia. SR 7 becomes a divided, limited-access highway with a speed limit of just west of the town of Round Hill, where another SR 7 Bus. splits off to serve the towns of Round Hill, Purcellville, and Hamilton, while the main road runs outside of the towns as a bypass. SR 7 Bus. rejoins the main road at the interchange with SR 9 in Paeonian Springs. SR 7 continues towards the well- developed eastern half of Loudoun County as a four-lane divided highway with some at-grade intersections, and it passes through Clarke's Gap in Catoctin Mountain. Another SR 7 Bus. splits off on the western side of the town of Leesburg, the county seat of Loudoun County. The main road continues as the Leesburg Bypass, and merges with the bypass of US 15 around the southern side of Leesburg, while the business route passes through town as Market Street. SR 7 Business intersects with US 15 Business (King Street) by the county courthouse in the center of Leesburg. The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has plans to widen the section of SR 7 between SR 9 and East Market Street. However, due to highway budget restrictions, this project was put on hold in June 2008. As of December 2014, construction had begun on the widening of this section of SR 7\\\\. In addition to widening Westbound SR 7 from two to three lanes, the median will be modified to limit left turns into and out of Roxbury Hall Road, Leeland Orchard Road, Fort Johnston Road, White Gate Place, and Beechnut Place. In addition to the work on SR 7, roundabouts will be installed at the interchange between SR 7 and SR 9\\\\. The southern roundabout will combine the separate intersections of the on and off ramps from SR 7 and Colonial Highway/Dry Mill Road into one. The SR 7 bypass crosses the Washington & Old Dominion Trail just before the US 15 bypass splits off from SR 7 in eastern Leesburg, and then SR 7 Bus. rejoins the main highway near the same location. SR 7 continues on through the eastern half of Leesburg, with six lanes. It then crosses Goose Creek, and passes through Ashburn. SR 7 was rebuilt as a controlled-access highway through eastern Loudoun County. To accomplish this, highway interchanges were constructed replacing the ordinary intersections at Belmont Ridge Road, Loudoun County Parkway, Riverside Parkway, and Ashburn Village Boulevard while closing the intersection at Lexington Drive. A new overpass was constructed to carry Sycolin Road across SR 7 in Leesburg, which opened to traffic on August 11, 2014. An additional interchange is planned at Battlefield Parkway in Leesburg. SR 7 passes by numerous housing subdivisions and businesses before it reaches an interchange with SR 28, close to the Fairfax County line in Sterling. SR 7 is named Leesburg Pike all the way across Fairfax County, where it is mainly a suburban route. It enters Fairfax County at the interchange with the Fairfax County Parkway (SR 286) and Algonkian Parkway. It continues through Fairfax County, passing by subdivisions and strip malls. It passes through Tysons Corner, where it intersects SR 123 and SR 267, the Dulles Access and Toll Roads. It then intersects the Capital Beltway (I-495) in McLean and intersects I-66 a half mile (0.8 km) west of the West Falls Church Metro station. View west along SR 7 in downtown Falls Church SR 7 then enters the independent city of Falls Church and becomes Broad Street and marks the north/south division for city streets. The road intersects US 29 in the city's center and crosses the W&OD; Trail in the city's west end. SR 7 then re-enters Fairfax County as Leesburg Pike and passes through Seven Corners, named for the five roads that intersect, including SR 338 (Hillwood Avenue) and US 50 (Arlington Boulevard), which is grade separated from the rest of the intersection. From there, it travels to Bailey's Crossroads, where it intersects SR 244 (Columbia Pike). SR 7 enters the City of Alexandria from Fairfax County and briefly forms the border between the Alexandria and Arlington County, and then intersects I- 395. It continues as King Street through Alexandria, passing by T. C. Williams High School, George Washington Masonic National Memorial, Union Station (Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express), and the King Street ‚Äì Old Town Metro station. SR 7 ends at the intersection of King Street and SR 400 (Washington Street) in Old Town Alexandria, one quarter of a mile (0.4 km) west of the Potomac River. Future = Intersection at Battlefield Parkway = VDOT is currently working on construction at the intersection of SR 7 and Battlefield Parkway in Loudoun County to construct a new single-point urban interchange. The project will cost $77.3 million and is expected to be completed in Fall 2021. Also as a part of the project: http://www.virginiadot.org/projects/resources/NorthernVirginia/106573_Route_7_at_Battlefield_Alts_TC_Meeting_2017-06-26_edits.pdf * Auxiliary lanes will be added to SR 7 on both sides of the intersection. * The current intersection of SR 7 and Cardinal Park Drive, west of the intersection of SR 7 and Battlefield Parkway, will be converted to a right in/right out intersection along SR 7 east. The intersection currently has a traffic signal allowing traffic from both directions of SR 7 to access Cardinal Park Drive. * Russell Branch Parkway will be extended to junction with Cardinal Park Drive to allow access from Cardinal Park Drive to SR 7 west. * New access roads will be built off Potomac Station Drive to connect to business with entrances currently on SR 7 near the intersection. = Intersection at Baron Cameron Avenue = On August 19, 2019, a third left-turn lane was added from SR 7 west to Baron Cameron Avenue. This was in place of constructing a partial interchange at the intersection, for which SR 7 east lanes would travel under Baron Cameron Avenue; the project was never started, as it was deemed too expensive. = Fairfax County widening project = VDOT is currently working on widening SR 7 from four to six lanes and adding shared-use paths along SR 7 between Reston Avenue and Jarrett Valley Drive in Fairfax County. The project is expected to cost $313.9 million and should be completed by mid-2024.

Tuscola High School succeeded the original Waynesville Township High School during the 1966 consolidation that merged Fines Creek and Crabtree High Schools with Waynesville. The school was built in the Tuscola community of East Waynesville, near Lake Junaluska and was named after the community in which it was built. Tuscola is a Cherokee word that means \\"Digging in Many Places\\". The school's mascot is a Mountaineer and the school colors are black and gold.  History  On September 30, 1963, the joint boards of education recommended that the schools of Haywood County consolidate. Due to the popular thought that larger schools could provide more opportunities at a more cost- effective price, plans were made to build two senior high schools, one on each side of the county. The construction of these new schools was to be financed by a 2.5 million-dollar bond, along with additional state and local funds. In order to make travel more reasonable for residents of Crabtree and Fines Creek, the location of the high school was moved from West Waynesville to an East Waynesville community near Lake Junaluska known as Tuscola. The name for the new high school became an issue for debate. Some wanted to keep the Waynesville name, while others suggested the name \\"Crabcreek\\", after the Crabtree and Fines Creek high schools. However, the school was named Tuscola, after the East Waynesville community in which it was built. The Waynesville school colors of black and gold and the Mountaineer mascot were both inherited by the new school.

Tests administered to humans include various forms of IQ tests; those administered to animals include the mirror test (a test of visual self- awareness) and the T maze test (which tests learning ability). Such study is important to research concerning the philosophy of mind and psychology, as well as determination of human and animal intelligence. Modern cognitive tests originated through the work of James McKeen Cattell who coined the term \\"mental tests\\". They followed Francis Galton's development of physical and physiological tests. For example, Galton measured strength of grip and height and weight. He established an \\"Anthropometric Laboratory\\" in the 1880s where patrons paid to have physical and physiological attributes measured. Galton's measurements had an enormous influence on psychology. Cattell continued the measurement approach with simple measurements of perception. Cattell's tests were eventually abandoned in favor of the battery test approach developed by Alfred Binet.  List of human tests  Inductive reasoning tests Inductive reasoning aptitude: Also known as abstract reasoning tests and diagrammatic style tests, are utilized by examining a person's problem-solving skills. This test is used to \\"measure the ability to work flexibly with unfamiliar information to find solutions.\\" These tests are often visualized through a set of patterns or sequences, with the user determining what does or does not belong. * Intelligence quotient Situational judgement test: A situational judgement test is used to examine how an individual responds to certain situations. Oftentimes these tests include a scenario with multiple responses, with the user selecting which response they feel is the most appropriate given the situation. This is used to assess how the user would respond to certain situations that may arise in the future. Some companies that use situational judgement tests during their hiring process include Sony, Walmart, Herbert Smith, and much more. *Working memory  Intelligence tests *Kohs block design test: \\"The Kohs Block Design Test is a non-verbal assessment of executive functioning, useful with the language and hearing impaired\\" * Mental age * Miller Analogies Test: According to Pearson Assessments, the Miller Analogies Test is used to determine a students ability to think analytically. The test is 60 minutes long, and is used by schools to determine those who are able to think analytically, and those who are only \\"memorizing and repeating information\\" * Otis‚ÄìLennon School Ability Test: The OLSAT is a multiple choice exam administered to students anywhere from Pre-K to 12th grade, used to identify which students are intellectually gifted. Students will need to be able to: \\"Follow directions, detect likenesses and differences, recall words and numbers, classify items, establish sequences, solve arithmetic problems, and complete analogies.\\" The test consists of a mixture between verbal and non-verbal sections, helping inform the schools of the students \\"verbal, nonverbal, and quantitative ability\\" * Raven's Progressive Matrices: The Raven's Progressive Matrices is a nonverbal test consisting of 60 multiple choice questions. This test is used to measure the individuals abstract reasoning, and is considered a nonverbal way to test an individuals \\"fluid intelligence.\\" * Stanford‚ÄìBinet Intelligence Scales: By measuring the memory, reasoning, knowledge, and processing power of the user, this test is able to determine \\"an individual‚Äôs overall intelligence, cognitive ability, and detect any cognitive impairment or learning disabilities.\\" This test measures five factors of cognitive ability, which are as follows: \\"fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing and working memory.\\" * Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale: The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) is used to determine and assess the intelligence of the participant. This is one of the more common tests used to test an individual's intelligence quotient. Throughout its history, this test has been revised multiple times since its creation, starting with the WAIS in 1955, to the WAIS-R in 1981, to the WAIS- III in 1996, and most recently the WAIS-IV in 2008. This test helps assess the level of the individuals verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. * Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children: The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) is for children within the age range of six to sixteen years old. While this test can be used to help determine a child's intelligence quotient, it is often used to determine a child's cognitive abilities. First introduced in 1949, the WSIC is now on its fifth edition (WISC-V), and was most recently updated in 2014. Similar to the WAIS (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), this test helps assess the level of the individuals verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. * Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence: The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) is used to assess the cognitive ability of children ages two years and six months old to seven years and seven months old. The current version of the test is the fourth edition (WPPSI-IV). Children between the ages of two years and six months old, to three years and 11 months old, are testing on the following: \\"block design, information, object assembly, picture naming, and receptive vocabulary\\". Children between the ages of four years old, to seven years and 7 months old, are testing on the following: \\"coding, comprehension, matrix reasoning, picture completion, picture concepts, similarities, symbol search, vocabulary, and word reasoning.\\" * Wonderlic test: The Wonderlic test is a multiple choice test consisting of 50 questions within a 12-minute time frame. Throughout the test, the questions become more and more difficult. The test is used to determine not only the individuals intelligence quotient, but also the strengths and weaknesses of the individual. The test consists of questions ranging from \\"English, reading, math, and logic problems\\" The Wonderlic test is notoriously used by NFL teams to help gain a better understanding of college prospects during the NFL combine. * Cognitive development tests Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery: The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is a test used to assess the \\"neuro-cognitive dysfunctions associated with neurologic disorders, phannacologic manipulations, and neuro-cognitive syndromes.\\" CANTAB is computer based program from Cambridge Cognition, and can test for \\"working memory, learning and executive function; visual, verbal and episodic memory; attention, information processing and reaction time; social and emotion recognition, decision making and response control.\\"  CDR computerized assessment system: The Cognitive Drug Research computerized assessment system is used to help determine if a drug has \\"cognitive-impairing properties\\".

This gives the surveyors a better understanding of how their questions are being perceived, and the \\"quality of the data\\" that is gained from the survey.  Draw-a-Person test: The Draw-a-Person test can be used on children, adolescents, and adults. It is most commonly used as a test for children and adolescents to assess their cognitive and intellectual ability by scoring their ability to draw human figures.  Knox Cubes: The Knox Cube Imitation Test (KCIT) is a nonverbal test used to assess intelligence. The creator of the KCIT, Howard A. Knox, described the test as: \\"Four 1-inch [black] cubes, 4 inches apart, are fastened to a piece of thin boarding. The movements and tapping are done with a smaller cube. The operator moves the cube from left to right facing the subject, and after completing each movement, the latter is asked to do likewise. Line a is tried first, then b, and so on to e. Three trials are given if necessary on lines a, b, c, and d, and five trials if needed on line e. To obtain the correct perspective the subject should be two feet from the cubes. The movements of the operator should be slow and deliberate.\\"  Modern Language Aptitude Test  Multiple choice: The style of multiple choice examination was expanded upon in 1934 when IBM introduced a \\"test scoring machine\\" that electronically sensed the location of lead pencil marks on a scanning sheet. This further increased the efficiency of scoring multiple-choice items and created a large-scale educational testing method.

Drevchenko and Poltava kobzar M. Kravchenko in Kharkiv 1902 Kozak Mamai playing a kobza A Kobzar (, pl. kobzari ) was an itinerant Ukrainian bard who sang to his own accompaniment played on a multistringed bandura or kobza. Tradition Kobzars were often blind and became predominantly so by the 1800s. Kobzar literally means 'kobza player', a Ukrainian stringed instrument of the lute family, and more broadly ‚Äî a performer of the musical material associated with the kobzar tradition.Volodymyr Kushpet \\"Startsivstvo\\", 500pp, Kyiv \\"Tempora\\" 2007Rainer Maria Rilke, Susan Ranson, Ben Hutchinson(2008), Rainer Maria Rilke's The book of hours, Camden House. p. 215. The professional kobzar tradition was established during the Hetmanate Era around the sixteenth century in Ukraine. Kobzars accompanied their singing with a musical instrument known as the kobza, bandura, or lira. Their repertoire primarily consisted of para- liturgical psalms and \\"kanty\\", and also included a unique epic form known as dumas. At the turn of the nineteenth century there were three regional kobzar schools: Chernihiv, Poltava, and Slobozhan, which were differentiated by repertoire and playing style. Guilds In Ukraine, kobzars organized themselves into regional guilds or brotherhoods, known as tsekhs. They developed a system of rigorous apprenticeships (usually three years in length) before undergoing the first set of open examinations in order to become a kobzar. These guilds were thought to have been modelled on the Orthodox Church brotherhoods as each guild was associated with a specific church. These guilds then would take care of one church icon or purchase new religious ornaments for their affiliated church (Kononenko, p. 568‚Äì9). The Orthodox Church however was often suspicious of and occasionally even hostile to kobzars. End of kobzardom The institution of the kobzardom essentially ended in the Ukrainian SSR in the mid 1930s during Stalin's radical transformation of rural society which included the liquidation of the kobzars of Ukraine.Grigorenko site Kobzar performance was replaced with stylized performances of folk and classical music utilising the bandura.  Soviet version  Soviet kobzars were stylised performers on the bandura created to replace the traditional authentic kobzari who had been wiped out in the 1930s. These performers were often blind and although some actually had contact with the authentic kobzari of the previous generation, many received formal training in the Folk conservatories by trained musicians and played on contemporary chromatic concert factory made instruments. Their repertoire was primarily made up of censored versions of traditional kobzar repertoire and focused on stylized works that praised the Soviet system and Soviet heroes. Re-establishment of the tradition A modern-day kobzar is playing a haunting tune on the bandura. In recent times, there has been an interest in reviving of authentic kobzar traditions which is marked by the re-establishing the Kobzar Guild as a centre for the dissemination of historical authentic performance practice.  Other use of the term  Kobzar is also a seminal book of poetry by Taras Shevchenko, the great national poet of Ukraine. The term \\"kobzar\\" has on occasion been used for hurdy-gurdy players in Belarus (where the hurdy-gurdy is often referred to as a \\"kobza\\", and bagpipe players in Poland where the bagpipe is referred to as a \\"kobza\\" or \\"koza\\").

He saved and rescued fugitive slaves for nearly fifteen years. He was one of the few black people to patent an invention before 1900. His house in Ripley has been designated a National Historic Landmark and restored.John P. Parker House\\", Underground Railroad, National Park Service, accessed 5 February 2011 Early life and education Parker was born in Norfolk, Virginia 1827. He was the son of a slave mother and white father. Born into slavery under the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, at the age of eight John was forced to walk to Richmond, where he was sold at the slave market to a physician from Mobile, Alabama. While working at the doctor's house as a domestic servant, John was taught to read and write by the doctor's family, although the law forbade slaves' being educated. During his apprenticeship in a foundry, John attempted escape to New Orleans by riverboat and had conflicts with officials. He asked one of the doctor's patients, a widow, to purchase him. After taking title to him, she allowed him to hire out to earn money, and he purchased his freedom from her for $1,800 in 1845. He earned the money through his work in two of Mobile's iron foundries and occasional odd jobs. Freedom in the North =Marriage and family= Parker left the South, first settling in Jeffersonville, Indiana, then Cincinnati, Ohio, where there were larger free black communities and jobs in the bustling port. There in 1848 he married Miranda Boulden, free born in the city. They moved to Ripley, a growing center of abolitionist activity, and had six children together:All information on the children comes from Stuart Seely Sprague, Preface to John P.

Two generations from slavery, all six went to college and entered the middle class. =Underground Railroad= Parker House and historic marker In Ripley, Parker joined the resistance movement, known as the Underground Railroad, whose members aided slaves escaping across the river from Kentucky to get further North to freedom; some chose to go to Canada. He guided hundreds of slaves along their way, continuing despite a $1,000 bounty placed on his head by slaveholders. The federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased the penalties for such activism. Parker risked his own freedom every time he went to Kentucky to help slaves to escape. During the Civil War, he recruited a few hundred slaves for the Union Army. ::See also Peter Fossett former enslaved person at Monticello who was a conductor of Coffin's Underground Railroad in Cincinnati Industrialist The historian Stuart Seely Sprague has researched much information about Parker and his life. Beginning as an iron moulder, Parker developed and patented a number of mechanical and industrial inventions, including the John P.

Together with Isla Choros and Isla Damas, the island forms the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve, which is administered by the Chilean Forestry Corporation. All three islands support populations of Humboldt penguins, but are also habitat for several other rare and endangered animal species such as the Peruvian diving petrel or the South American marine otter. In recent years the reserve has experienced a strong increase in tourist activities, mainly due to being an important feeding ground in the sunner months of different marine mammal species like fin whales, blue whales, humpback whales, and bottlenose dolphins that reside in the waters of the reserve. The local fishermen formed an association in cooperation with the National Tourism Service Sernatur to conduct whale watching activities in a sustainable manner, implementing responsible whale watching guidelines. Isla Cha√±aral is the biggest of the reserve's islands. Access to the island restricted by permit only. The island consists of two plateau levels. The main plateau between 50 and 70 meters above sea level is divided into a western and an eastern part by a second high plateau (>100 m). The vegetation of the plateaus differs considerably. While the main plateau is dominated by shrub and cacti the high plateau has a barren appearance with only few small cactus aggregations.

The road is not complete, in the sense of having a gap across the Danube between CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi and Ostrov. The gap is covered by ferry-boats operated by two private companies every 30‚Äì35 minutes during the day and every 45‚Äì90 minutes during the night. When designated as a trunk route, in the early 1960s, this was the shortest road between Bucharest and Constanta, as, at that time, there were no road bridges connecting Dobrudja with the rest of Romania (the King Carol I Bridge at CernavodƒÉ being rail only). As road bridges over the Danube were constructed, the first one in 1970 at Giurgeni ‚Äì Vadu Oii, and the second one at Fete»ôti-CernavodƒÉ (CernavodƒÉ Bridge) in the late 1980s, the road lost almost all importance. Currently, the main road connection between Bucharest and Constanta is done via the A2 motorway, opened between 2004 and 2009, while CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi is served through an exit from the same motorway at Drajna. Currently, the route is very sparsely used between Bucharest and CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi, mainly by commuters between Bucharest and its suburbs of Pantelimon and BrƒÉne»ôti, as well as by villagers along its route, as a feeder to A2. Between Ostrov and Constanta, the road provides a vital link between southwestern Dobrudja and the rest of the country. However, as southwestern Dobrudja is sparsely populated, with no notable towns or cities (Ostrov being the biggest, at slightly over 5000 inhabitants), that stretch of the road is sparsely used as well. DN3 connects with the Bulgarian road network through a border crossing facility at Ostrov ‚Äì Silistra (Bulgaria), immediately after the ferry landing. Thus, if counting the CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi-Ostrov ferry as part of the DN3 road, it can be said that one of the main remaining roles of DN3 is providing a connection between CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi and Silistra. Note that as of 2009, there is also a direct, newly built CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi ‚Äì Silistra ferry, but is far slower (takes almost 2 hours to cross the 8 km distance) and far more infrequent.

It was first synthesized in 1913Chemische Berichte, 1913, vol.46, p. 2083 but its activity was not discovered until the 1930s.Acta Academiae Aboensis, Series B: Mathematica et Physica, 1939, vol. 11, #14 p. 3,7 Under the names Betanamin, Cylert, Tradon, and Ceractiv it was used as a medication to treat attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it is a Schedule IV drug.Annual Estimates Of Requirements Of Narcotic Drugs, Manufacture Of Synthetic Drugs, Opium Production And Cultivation Of The It is no longer generally available in the United States as a result of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrawing approval of pemoline as an indicated treatment for ADHD, due to its implication in liver failures among children who were receiving the medication. An FDA Alert warned against prescribing pemoline for ADHD. This spurred Abbott Laboratories, the patent owner of Cylert, to cease manufacturing Cylert. Manufacturers of the generic equivalents followed suit. Mechanism of action Pemoline is generally considered dopaminergic, but its precise method of action hasn't yet been definitively determined. Pemoline passes the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and acts as a surrogate for dopamine, not affecting endogenous intracellular dopamine. For this reason, and the fact that it has little or no affinity for adrenaline receptors, pemoline has minimal sympathomimetic side effects such as: dry mouth, reduction in appetite, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, constriction of smooth muscle, cardiac stress, dilated pupils and insomnia. There is some data to suggest that pemoline is a nootropic acting as a catalyst conductor in the synapses of the brain's memory centers, raising the efficiency of memory and assisting RNA formation in the brain. While drugs like dexamphetamine and methylphenidate are classified as Schedule II, pemoline is listed as Schedule IV (non-narcotic). In studies conducted on primates, pemoline fails to demonstrate a potential for self-administration. Pemoline is Schedule IV Non- Narcotic (Stimulant) controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 1530 and is not subject to annual manufacturing quotas. The salts in use are pemoline magnesium (free base conversion ratio .751), pemoline iron (.578), pemoline copper (.644), pemoline nickel (.578), pemoline rubidium, pemoline calcium, pemoline chromium, and chelates of the above which are identical in weight to the salt mentioned. Pemoline free base and pemoline cobalt, strontium, silver, barium, lithium, sodium, potassium, zinc, manganese, and caesium are research chemicals which can be produced in situ for experiments.DEA office of Diversion Control site: Federal Register publications of CSA schedules, 2014 Q1The A-Z Encyclopaedia of Alcohol and Drug AbuseCRC Handbook of Chemistry & Physics Others such as lanthanide pemoline salts such as pemoline cerium can be prepared; pemoline beryllium would presumably be toxic. Interactions Other stimulants and MAOIs are contraindicated with pemoline. Liver toxicity In some patients pemoline is suspected of causing hepatotoxicity, so the FDA recommended that regular liver tests should be performed on those treated with it. Since receiving FDA approval in 1975, it has been linked with 21 cases of liver failure, of which 13 resulted in liver replacement or death. Approximately 1‚Äì2% of patients taking the drug show elevated levels of liver transaminase enzymes, a marker for liver toxicity, though serious cases are rare. Over 200,000 children with ADHD were prescribed pemoline in the US and Canada alone during the 25 years it was available, plus a smaller number of adults prescribed it for indications such as chronic fatigue syndrome and apathy in the elderly (and not including prescriptions in the rest of the world), so the number of liver failure cases was statistically not that large. However the reactions proved idiosyncratic and unpredictable, with patients sometimes taking the drug with no issue for months or even years, before suddenly developing severe liver toxicity. There was no clear exposure- toxicity relationship, and no characteristic liver pathology findings. Some patients showed as little as one week between first appearance of jaundice and complete liver failure, and some of the patients that developed liver failure had not showed elevated liver transaminase levels when tested previously. Pemoline (as Betanamin) continues to be available in Japan, where no liver failure cases have been reported associated with its use, however it is only prescribed for the niche indication of narcolepsy, and at a lower dose than previously used in the USA.Shader RI. Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), Pemoline, and What Is a Signal? Clin Ther. 2017 Apr;39(4):665-669. In March 2005 Abbott Laboratories and generic manufacturers withdrew pemoline from the American market due to concerns about the liver toxicity risk.

Upon moving to Ripley, Ohio, in 1822, he became known as one of Ohio's first and most active \\"conductors\\" on the Underground Railroad. Prominent pre-Civil War abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Weld, Henry Ward Beecher, and Harriet Beecher Stowe were influenced by Rankin's writings and work in the anti-slavery movement. When Henry Ward Beecher was asked after the end of the Civil War, \\"Who abolished slavery?,\\" he answered, \\"Reverend John Rankin and his sons did.\\" Early career Rankin House, on Liberty Hill in Ripley, Ohio Rankin was born at Dandridge, Jefferson County, Tennessee, to Richard and Jane (Steele) Rankin, and raised in a strict Calvinist home. His parents were literate, which was unusual in a remote area. They were staunch Presbyterians, and their children had a religious upbringing. Jane was an unyielding opponent of slavery. Beginning at the age of eight, John's view of the world and his religious faith were deeply affected by two things  the revivals of the Second Great Awakening that were sweeping through the Appalachian region, and the incipient slave rebellion led by Gabriel Prosser in 1800. John's school had log walls and an earthen floor. He was able to enroll in Washington College, under the direction of Rev. Samuel Doak, an avowed abolitionist; he graduated in 1816. After graduation he was minister of the Abingdon Presbytery, but because his anti-slavery views were not welcome he left Tennessee in 1817, never to return. Not a natural public speaker, Rankin worked hard while at Jefferson County Presbyterian Church simply to deliver an effective sermon. Within a few months, however, despite Tennessee's status as a slave state, he summoned the courage to speak against \\"all forms of oppression\\" and then, specifically, slavery. He was one of the founders of the Tennessee Manumission Society, in 1815. He was shocked when his elders responded by telling him that he should consider leaving Tennessee if he intended ever to oppose slavery from the pulpit again. He knew that his faith would not allow him to keep his views to himself, so he decided in 1817 to move his family to the town of Ripley, across the Ohio River in the free state of Ohio, where he had heard from family members that a number of anti-slavery Virginians had settled. On the way north, Rankin stopped to preach at Lexington and Paris, Kentucky, and learned about the need for a minister at Concord Presbyterian Church in Carlisle, Kentucky. The congregation had been involved in anti-slavery activities as far back as 1807, when they and twelve other churches formed the Kentucky Abolition Society, and Rankin's deepening anti-slavery views were nurtured there by his listeners. He remained for four years and started a school for slaves; within a year, however, they were driven first from a schoolhouse to an empty house, and then to his friend's kitchen by club-carrying mobs, and the students finally stopped coming. Spurred by a financial crisis in the area, Rankin decided to complete his family's journey to Ripley. On the night of December 31, 1821 - January 1, 1822, he rowed his family across the icy river. In Ripley he founded a Presbyterian academy for boys, where in 1838 the young Ulysses S. Grant once attended.Waugh, 2009, p. 19 Ripley and the Underground Railroad View from a window in the Rankin house. The Kentucky shoreline is visible on the far side of the Ohio River. In 1822, Ripley was a town of frequent street fights and shootouts, where the most common type of business was a saloon. During the Rankins' first few months there, hecklers and protesters often followed the new preacher through town and gathered outside his cabin while their first permanent home was being built, just yards from the river at 220 Front Street. When the local newspaper began publishing his letters to his brother on the topic of slavery (see next section), Rankin's reputation grew among both supporters and opponents of the anti-slavery movement. Slave owners and hunters often viewed him as their prime suspect and appeared at his door at all hours demanding information about fugitives. Soon, Rankin realized that the home was too accessible a place for him to properly raise his family. In 1829, Rankin moved his wife and nine children (of an eventual total of thirteen) to a house at the top of a -high hill that provided a wide view of the village, the River and the Kentucky shoreline, as well as farmland and fruit groves that could provide sources of income. Folklore associated with the Rankin home suggested that a lantern or candle was placed in the front window to guide runaway slaves from across the Ohio River, in Mason County, Kentucky. However, ex-slave narrative recalls a pole with a light. This is a more plausible means of being seen based on the proximity of the house to the river. From there the family could raise a lantern on a flagpole to signal fleeing slaves in Kentucky when it was safe for them to cross into the free state of Ohio. [1]Jacobson, The Rankin House Rankin also constructed a staircase leading up the hill to the house for slaves to climb up to safety on their way further north. For over forty years leading up to the Civil War, many of the slaves who escaped to freedom through Ripley stayed at the family's home.Autobiography of John Rankin According to him, \\"I have had under my roof as many as twelve fugitive slaves at a time, all of whom made good their way to Victoria's dominions [Canada],\\" sometimes entire families. It became known as the Rankin House and is now a US National historic landmark (see photos). =The real Eliza= During a visit by Rankin to Lane Theological Seminary to see one of his sons, he told Professor Calvin Stowe the story of a woman the Rankins had housed in 1838 after she escaped by crossing the frozen Ohio River with her child in her arms. Stowe's wife (Harriet Beecher Stowe) also heard the account and later modeled the character Eliza in her book Uncle Tom's Cabin after the woman.Hagedorn, p. 139 =Film depiction= Brothers of the Borderland, a film that depicts Rankin's work in the Underground Railroad in Ripley, is a permanent feature of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, in Cincinnati. Letters on Slavery A copy of John Rankin's book, Letters On Slavery, published in 1826 Early in his time in Ripley, Rankin learned that his brother Thomas, a merchant in Augusta County, Virginia, had purchased slaves. He was provoked to write a series of anti-slavery letters to his brother that were published by the editor of the local Ripley newspaper The Castigator. When the letters were published in book form in 1826 as Letters on Slavery, they provided one of the first clearly articulated anti-slavery views printed west of the Appalachians. Thomas Rankin, convinced by his brother's words, moved to Ohio in 1827 and freed his slaves. By the 1830s, Letters on Slavery had become standard reading for abolitionists all over the United States. In 1832, William Lloyd Garrison printed them in his anti-slavery newspaper, The Liberator. Garrison later called Rankin his \\"anti-slavery father,\\" saying that \\"his book on slavery was the cause of my entering the anti-slavery conflict.\\"Hagedorn, p. 58 Beyond the pulpit In 1833 Rankin came to know Theodore Weld through their involvement in the creation of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Weld had come from Connecticut, by way of Oneida County, New York, to attend Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio. Rankin attended the debates on slavery organized by Weld at Lane in February of 1834, and published a pamphlet on its consequences. In November 1834, at Rankin's Ripley church, Weld began a year-long series of speeches throughout Ohio that raised the profile of the abolitionist movement in the state; at his urging Rankin did likewise. Many local anti-slavery societies were founded. in April of 1835 an Ohio Anti-slavery Society was formed, at whose initial meeting in Putnam, Ohio (today Zanesville), both Rankin and Weld played key roles. On his way home, Rankin had his first real experience with mob opposition to his efforts, as he was showered with rotten eggs. When he stopped in Chillicothe to speak at a church, stones were thrown through a window.Hagedorn, pp. 99-100 In 1836, Weld invited Rankin to join a group called \\"the Seventy\\", who were selected by the American Anti-Slavery Society to travel to churches throughout the Northern states preaching immediate emancipation (\\"immediatism\\") and forming local anti-slavery societies. Released by his congregation for one year to participate in the effort, Rankin's passion for the cause grew with the opposition to his \\"dangerous\\" views, even among many who opposed slavery but feared provoking a slave uprising. A bounty of up to $3,000 was placed on his life, and in 1841 he and his sons had to fight off attackers who came to burn his house and barn in the middle of the night.Hagedorn, p. 113, 219 Ulysses S. Grant was a student at Rankin's Presbyterian Academy in Ripley in the fall of 1838. Grant entered the U. S. Military Academy in 1839. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 heightened the danger and profile of their assistance to runaways as it was now illegal to do so, even in free states. At an anti-slavery society meeting in Highland County, Ohio, held by Rankin and Salmon P. Chase, however, Rankin declared that \\"Disobedience to the enactment is obedience to God.\\"Hagedorn, p. 243 Opposition within his own congregation, spurred by Rankin's attempts to expel slave-owners from the church, finally led him to resign in 1846 after 24 years as minister of the Ripley Presbyterian Church. Over one-third of the church's members left with him and helped Rankin establish what eventually came to be the Free Presbyterian Church, which may have had as many as 72 congregations before the coming of the Civil War.Larry G. Willey, \\"John Rankin, Antislavery Prophet, and the Free Presbyterian Church,\\" American Presbyterians, 72:3 (Fall 1994), 167. After the war, Rankin welcomed the reunion of the Presbyterian churches in Ripley.Willey, 169. \\"Freedom's Heroes\\" Rankin's grave at Maplewood Cemetery in Ripley In May 1892, six years after John Rankin's death, a monument aptly named \\"Freedom's Heroes\\", was dedicated to Rankin and his wife, Jean Lowry Rankin, on the grounds of the Maplewood Cemetery in Ripley, Ohio. \\"National Abolition Hall of Fame\\" Rankin was a 2013 Inductee into the National Abolition Hall of Fame in Peterboro, New York.http://www.nationalabolitionhalloffameandmuseum.org/jrankin.html Writings     * Archival material Archival material on Rankin is held by the Ohio Historical Society, Columbus.

Tesla used it for only one year, until 1900, and it was torn down in 1904 to pay his outstanding debts.  History  A multiple exposure picture (one of 68 images created by Century Magazine photographer Dickenson Alley) of Tesla sitting in his Colorado Springs laboratory with his \\"magnifying transmitter\\" generating millions of volts. The long arcs were not part of the normal operation, but only produced for effect by rapidly cycling the power switch. In May 1899, Tesla, several of his assistants, and a local contractor commenced the construction of Tesla's laboratory shortly after arriving in Colorado Springs, a high-altitude location where he would have more room than in his downtown New York City laboratory for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments. Tesla moved there to study the conductive nature of low pressure air,Robert Uth, Tesla, Master of Lightning, Barnes & Noble Publishing - 1999, page 92PBS, Tesla - Life and Legacy - Colorado SpringsW. Bernard Carlson, Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press - 2013, page 264 part of his research into wireless transmission of electrical power. The lab possessed the largest Tesla coil ever built, in diameter,Hull, Richard, The Tesla Coil Builder's Guide to The Colorado Springs Notes of Nikola Tesla, 21st Century Books, 1994, p. 89. which was a preliminary version of the magnifying transmitter planned for installation in the Wardenclyffe Tower. Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris. An Alley photograph from Colorado Springs documenting three lights receiving power by means of electrodynamic induction from an oscillator from the bulbs (placed on the ground outside the building to demonstrate they had no connection to the power source). He produced artificial lightning, with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to long.Gillispie, Charles Coulston, \\"Dictionary of Scientific Biography;\\" Tesla, Nikola. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. People walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground. Sparks sprang from water line taps when touched. Light bulbs within of the lab glowed even when turned off. Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes. Butterflies were electrified, swirling in circles with blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings. Another Alley photo of a grounded tuned coil in resonance with a transmitter, illuminating a light near the bottom of the picture. Tesla did not disclose how far away the transmitter was. While experimenting, Tesla inadvertently faulted a power station generator, causing a power outage. In August 1917, Tesla explained what had happened in The Electrical Experimenter: \\"As an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated, it was found that the dynamos in a power house away were repeatedly burned out, due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them, and which caused heavy sparks to jump through the windings and destroy the insulation!\\" During his time at his laboratory Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he concluded might be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to reporter Julian Hawthorne at the Philadelphia North American on 8 December 1899Daniel Blair Stewart (1999). Tesla: The Modern Sorcerer, Frog Book. p. 372 and in a December 1900 letter about possible discoveries in the new century to the Red Cross Society where he referred to messages \\"from another world\\" that read \\"1 ... 2 ... 3 ...\\". Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article \\"Talking With Planets\\" where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing \\"intelligently controlled signals\\" and that the signals could come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments in July 1899‚ÄîMarconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado‚Äîor signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission. On 7 January 1900 Tesla made his final entry in his journal while in Colorado Springs. In 1904 Tesla was sued for unpaid bills in Colorado Springs, his lab was torn down in that year, and its contents were sold two years later in an auction at the court house to satisfy his debts.  Location  The Experimental Station was located on empty land on the highest local point (Knob Hill) between the 1876 Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind and the Union Printers Home, where Tesla conducted the research described in the Colorado Springs Notes, 1899-1900. A few papers of the times listed Tesla's lab as about 200 feet east of the Deaf and Blind School and 200 feet north of Pikes Peak Avenue. This put it on top of the hill at E. Kiowa Street and N.

Nathan's works focus on Japanese culture, Japanese literature, Japanese cinema, the theory and practice of translation., and the sociology of business culture. Nathan first met Yukio Mishima in 1963. In 1965, at the age of 25, Nathan translated Mishima's The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea. Impressed by Nathan's translation, Mishima requested Nathan sign on as his translator and help Mishima in his quest in being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Nathan was more interested in translating the work of Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe. Nathan ultimately refused to translate Mishima's 1964 novel , opting instead to translate Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe's A Personal Matter. Mishima, who was considered an \\"arch-rival\\" of ≈åe, abruptly severed ties with Nathan afterwards. In 1974, Nathan authored Mishima: A Biography (1974), a definitive biography of Yukio Mishima. In 1994, Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and Nathan accompanied him to Stockholm. Nathan left Princeton in the late 1970s to pursue filmmaking. He created three documentaries about the Japanese. In 1999, Nathan published Sony: The Private Life, a biography of Sony Corporation. The book was the product of 115 interviews conducted by Nathan with current and past key executives of Sony.https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1999/10-01/0013_inside_look_at_sony_lacks_excitem.html In 2004, he published Japan Unbound: A Volatile Nation's Quest for Pride and Purpose, a scholarly work which provides a historical context to contemporary Japan. In 2008, Nathan published his memoir, Living Carelessly in Tokyo and Elsewhere. In 2013, Nathan published a translation of Natsume S≈çseki's unfinished novel Light and Dark. In 2018, Nathan published a biography of S≈çseki titled S≈çseki: Modern Japan's Greatest Novelist.

The CVUSD Board itself has also faced criticism for multiple years for having public prayers, Bible readings, and Christian proselytizing during its public meetings. The majority of Board members are members of either Calvary Chapel Chino Hills or other similar Christian conservative congregations in the district, and most regularly tout their religious beliefs during Board discussions. Despite numerous letters of complaint from various individuals and groups, the Board has either ignored these complaints or officially rejected to change their practices. The administration actively solicits local Christian pastors to lead Board invocations, and the Board regularly presents recognition awards to religious leaders who provide \\"support and prayers for the Chino Valley Unified School District\\".Chino Valley Unified School District, In July 2010, the CVUSD approved a resolution to introduce \\"Bible as Literature and History\\" courses at its four high schools, based on a curricula provided by the local Calvary Chapel Chino Hills church and the textbook The Bible and its Influence, written by Christian Evangelical educational political activist Charles Stetson.Daily Bulletin, August 5, 2010, On November 11, 2014, the Freedom From Religion Foundation filed a federal lawsuit against the Board claiming violations of the US and California Constitutions. Although the suit alleged that all of the Board members regularly participated in religious proselytizing, James Na, was singled out as a prime violator of religious neutrality during the meetings, regularly including Christian and Biblical references into many of his official statements. The suit alleges at one recent Board meeting, Na \\"urged everyone who does not know Jesus Christ to go and find Him,\\" and closed the meeting with a reading of Psalm 143.November 12, 2014,School board which proselytizes during meetings dares the FFRF to sue them. The FFRF has obliged; patheos.com; November 17, 2014. On February 18, 2016, U.S. District Judge Jesus Bernal made a ruling on the FFRF lawsuit, ordering the Board to stop reciting prayers, Bible readings, and proselytizing during school board meetings. On March 4, 2016, the school board voted 3-2 in favor of appealing the ruling. On November 3, 2016, the Board changed their policies to explicitly state when board members can and cannot express their faith during meetings. On July 25, 2018, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit unanimously affirmed the District Court's ruling, holding that the \\"policy and practice of prayer at Chino Valley Board meetings violates the Establishment Clause.\\" =School closures= On March 5, 2009, the Chino Valley Unified School District Board of Education voted 4 to 1 vote to approve a budget reduction plan which included the closure of El Rancho Elementary School and Richard Gird Elementary School, both in Chino, and Los Serranos Elementary School in Chino Hills. Ms. Sylvia Orozco, Board President, Mr. William Klein, Vice President, Mr. Fred Youngblood, Clerk and Mr. James Na, Board member all voted in favor of the budget reduction plan based on the recommendations of the Chino Valley Unified School District Superintendent, Dr. Edmond T. Heatley. Mr. Michael Calta, Board member was the dissenting vote. These three schools were closed at the end of the 2008/2009 school year and their students were reassigned to other schools in the District. The process in which these schools were selected to be closed were alleged to violate California Education Code 17387, which states, \\"It is the intent of the Legislature to have the community involved before decisions are made about school closure or the use of surplus space, thus avoiding community conflict and assuring building use that is compatible with the community's needs and desires\\". Charges were made against the Board of racial / national origin motivations in choosing the schools that they did close. A complaint was issued with the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights regarding the nature and process followed for these school closings. On June 29, 2012, the OCR closed its investigation and released its final report of its findings of the allegations. The report found that, while there were good budgetary reasons for the District to be closing schools at this time, the process used to do so was ad-hoc and disorganized, and appeared to rely principally on the opinions of the District Superintendent with little documentation, public input or transparency. In response, the CVUSD agreed with the OCR's findings and adopted new formal policies for school closure which provided greater transparency and public input into the process.June 29, 2012, Office for Civil Rights, US Department of Education, =Conflict of interest and perjury= In 2006, a member of the school district board was charged with conflict of interest and perjury for allegedly benefiting from a contract between the school district and his employer. He is accused of steering district business to Office Max and failing to accurately report his income at that company in his annual conflict-of-interest statement with the school board.

Padilla and three other Franciscans, together with more than 300 Spanish soldiers and workers, accompanied Coronado on his quest for the Seven Cities of Gold, a mythical land of great wealth. When Coronado abandoned his search, Padilla and others followed him to explore what is now the Southwestern United States; Padilla was one of the first Europeans to see the Grand Canyon. But, when Coronado was told by a native named the \\"Turk\\" that a great land called Quivira was in modern-day Kansas, Coronado's entire party immediately left in search of it. After reaching the location in 1541, the Spaniards camped alongside a Wichita village for 25 days. Finding no gold, they killed the Turk in fury. Coronado returned to the Southwest and Padilla followed. One year later, the missionary priest returned to Kansas to preach to the Wichita, and establish the first Christian mission in the present-day United States. He was killed in Kansas in 1542 by Native Americans, and is considered to be one of the first Christian martyrs in the U.S.Engelhardt, p. 14: \\"...[in] 1542, three Friars Minor were martyred in New Mexico as victims of their zeal for the Christian Faith. They were Fr. Juan de Padilla, Fr. Juan de la Cruz, and Brother Luis de Ubeda or Escalona. Ghost phenomenon and legend Juan de Padilla is associated with a miracle known as the \\"Rising of the coffin of Padre Padilla\\".Samuel Gance. Anton ou la trajectoire d'un p√®re. L'Harmattan, 2013, p.179-186. The story of seeing his coffin rise above the ground was repeated for many years, and was believed by many people in Isleta, where the Padre is believed to be buried. This is not the same Juan de Padilla as the proto-martyr of the United States. Incorrupt by the Catholic Church The first time when the coffin rose, the body was as fresh when he was buried. However, since there are no witnesses to prove this, and he has a missing foot now, it has since becoming New Mexico folklore. Anton Docher, once a priest in Isleta, investigated the miracle in the presence of several witnesses. He opened the grave of Padre Padilla. During this operation, Docher injured his arm and suffered from the then highly deadly gangrene.Ray John de Arag√≥n. Hidden History of Spanish New Mexico, 2012, p.81 Doctors recommended amputation for his survival. The natives inhabitants evoked the intercession of Padre Padilla. Docher made a prayer to Padre Padilla to cure and forgive him for what he did, and supposedly, the wound had disappeared.Alice Bullock.

It is a dance-pop, new jack swing and R&B; song. Prior to Carey signing a record contract, she and producer Ben Margulies had written and produced a four-track demo which included \\"Someday\\". After signing a contract with Columbia Records, Carey began work on her debut album and she reached out to Ric Wake to ask if he would produce the song, to which he agreed. The composition of the demo recording was changed during the recording process, most notably replacing the horns with a guitar, which Carey disapproved of. \\"Someday\\" was released as the album's third single on November 15, 1990, in the United Kingdom and was released the following month in the United States with multiple remixes. The song was a critical and commercial success, being described as an album highlight and becoming Carey's third consecutive number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100. \\"Someday\\" was subsequently included on many of Carey's compilation albums and greatest hits releases, including #1's (1998), Greatest Hits (2001), The Essential Mariah Carey (2011) and #1 to Infinity (2015). Background In 1988, an 18-year-old Mariah Carey moved out from her mother's house in Long Island and into an apartment in Manhattan. She had composed a four-track demo tape with her writing partner Ben Margulies while she was attending high school. As 1988 progressed, Carey struggled to impress record executives with the tape and had failed in securing a record deal. She worked several jobs, including as a waitress and coat-checker, in order to pay for studio sessions with Margulies to make changes to the demo. After several months, Carey befriended singer Brenda K. Starr, and soon became one of her back-up vocalists. During recording sessions and rehearsals, Starr began to notice \\"glimpses\\" of Carey's \\"gifted\\" vocals. She thought that Carey was capable of achieving mainstream success and that she needed some guidance to break into the industry. One evening, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records, was interested in Carey; as she handed him the tape, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola grabbed it from him, and said that he would tend to \\"the project\\". Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and invited her to go to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, \\"When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom.\\" After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988. Recording Prior to Carey signing her record deal with Columbia, she and Margulies had written and produced fourteen songs over a three-year period, seven of which made the final track listing of her self-titled debut studio album (1990), including \\"Someday\\". \\"Someday\\" was one of the four songs which were on the demo tape handed to Mottola prior to her signing the contract. Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that \\"Someday\\" was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying \\"I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it if you want to do it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me.\\" \\"Someday\\" was recorded and mixed by Bob Cadway at The Power Station in New York City. In addition to be written by Carey and Margulies, they also arranged the song with Chris Toland. In addition to producing the track, Wake also carried out additional arrangement with Rich Tancredi. The drum programming was performed by Wake and Joe Franco, while Cadway played the guitars and Tancredi the keyboards. Carey performed all of her own background vocals. Carey later revealed that \\"Someday\\" was one of her favorite songs on the demo and that she would \\"listen to it over and over again on the subway after the studio sessions\\". However, Carey later expressed her disapproval of some of the new elements added during the production of Mariah Carey, such as the replacement of the horns on the demo in favor of an electric guitar. Composition and critical reception The fourth song on the track list of Mariah Carey, \\"Someday\\" is the album's first up-tempo track. It is a dance-pop, new jack swing and R&B; song, which lasts for a duration of four minutes, six seconds. \\"Someday\\" is set in common time and in the key of E major. Lyrically, it is about how Carey is \\"gleefully\\" waiting for bad karma to come to her ex- boyfriend who \\"dumped\\" her, which can be heard in the lyrics \\"Cause I know you'll soon discover / you're needing me in spite of all the others.\\" AllMusic writer Ashley S. Battel said it is \\"energetic\\". Music & Media described the song as \\"upbeat dance pop with a prominent role for Carey's joyous and confident vocals.\\" To mark twenty-five years since the release of Mariah Carey in June 1990, Billboard writer Trevor Anderson wrote a track-by-track review of the album in June 2015. He noted that, being the fourth track on the track listing, it is the album's first up-tempo song and that is \\"beats new life\\" into it as a result. However, he felt that some of the rhythmic arrangements and the electric guitar solo during the bridge prevented \\"Someday\\" from sounding timeless. Release and remixes \\"Someday\\" was released as the third single Mariah Carey as a CD single in the United Kingdom on November 15, 1990, and as a maxi single in the United States on December 13, 1990. Included on the maxi single are the 'New 7\\" Jackswing,' the 'New 7\\" Straight', the 'New 12\\" Jackswing' and the 'Pianopercapella ‚Äì New' mix, all of which were produced by Shep Pettibone, while \\"Alone in Love\\" was included as the B-side. \\"Alone in Love\\" was also written by Carey and Margulies, and produced by Rhett Lawrence. \\"Someday\\" has been included on many of Carey's compilation albums and greatest hits releases, including #1's (1998), Greatest Hits (2001), The Essential Mariah Carey (2011), and #1 to Infinity (2015). On July 24, 2020, along with the celebration of the 30th-anniversary of her album Mariah Carey, she released the song as an extended play, titled Someday EP, which contains the remixes from the US maxi single, as well as previously unreleased remixes, including the 'House Dub Version', the 'New Jack Dub Version' and the 'New Jack Bonus Beats'. =MTV Unplugged version= Despite having released two highly successful albums, Mariah Carey and Emotions (1991), the singer had yet to embark on world tour because of stage-fright and the possible negative effects of singing vocally strenuous songs every night. Many critics were unconvinced with her reasoning, and accused her of manipulating her vocals in the studio. In response, Carey appeared on MTV Unplugged to perform a small selection of her songs live in 1992. For her rendition of \\"Someday\\", she altered the arrangement and stripped it back to give it a rawer sound. This version was produced by Carey and Afanasieff and recorded live at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City on March 16, 1992. In the liner notes of #1 to Infinity, Carey expressed her dislike toward the original studio version on Mariah Carey and stated that she wished she could \\"delete some of the overproduction,\\" which is why she decided to include the MTV Unplugged version on the compilation instead. The arrangement of MTV Unplugged rendition was also included on the set-list of Carey's Las Vegas residency show, #1 to Infinity (2015‚Äì17). Chart performance In the United States, \\"Someday\\" became Carey's third consecutive number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 following \\"Vision of Love\\" and \\"Love Takes Time\\". \\"Someday\\" became her first song to top the Dance Club Songs chart on March 16, 1991, and her second chart topper on the Radio Songs chart. The track peaked at number three on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number five on the Adult Contemporary chart. After three months of release, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the song gold, denoting shipments of more than 500,000 copies. In 2015, Billboard writer Gary Trust compiled a list of Carey's twenty-five best performing songs based on their weekly performance; \\"Someday\\" ranks as the singer's eighth best performing track of her career on the Hot 100. Trust also noted that Carey \\"proved her way\\" by releasing a club song which reached number-one following two chart-topping ballads. In Canada, \\"Someday\\" reached at number five on the main chart, but peaked at number one on both the Top Singles and Adult Contemporary charts. It also reached a peak of number four on the Dance chart. Outside of North America, \\"Someday\\" reached the top fifteen in New Zealand, the top forty in France and the United Kingdom, and the top fifty in Australian and Belgium. Music video The accompanying music video begins with Carey, revisiting her youth, wandering a high school corridor and standing inside a classroom of schoolchildren playing various musical instruments with inter-cutting clips of men playing on drums. Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing her movements, and her efforts to catch a schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about in the classroom and corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of schoolchildren are shown dancing in the corridor as the boy she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 6 million views on YouTube as of July 2020. On July 29, 2020, the music video was re-released in a remastered form, in HD quality. The extended version of the video was included on The First Vision 1991 VHS and its subsequent DVD reissue, in which Carey stated that she loved watching the kids dancing and getting to interact with them and that she had fun during the video shoot. The video was removed from the tracklisting of the #1's video release, as Carey felt ashamed of the results of the video, instead being replaced by the MTV Unplugged performance. In 2015, to coincide with the release of #1 to Infinity Carey released videos of herself talking about the videos to songs on the compilation.

Barneys New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2019 and closed 15 of its 22 stores, including flagship stores in Las Vegas, Chicago, and Seattle. Following its sale in November 2019, Authentic Brands Group took control of the Barneys brand name and licensed it to Saks Fifth Avenue.Barneys Is Sold for Scrap, Ending an Era Vanessa Friedman and Sapna Maheshwari, The New York Times, November 1, 2019 Barneys New York bankrupt Phil Wahba, Fortune, November 1, 2019 Operations under Pressman family ownership =Early history= Barney Pressman initially opened a men‚Äôs discount clothing store. His first store was in a space with of frontage at Seventh Avenue and West 17th Street in Manhattan in 1923. He raised the $500 to pay the lease by pawning his wife's engagement ring. Barney's Clothes were stocked with 40 brand name suits and a big sign with a slogan, \\"No Bunk, No Junk, No Imitations\\". Barney's sold clothing at discounted prices by purchasing showroom samples, retail overstocks, and manufacturers' closeouts at auctions and bankruptcy sales. He also offered free alterations and free parking to attract customers. And this first of its kind store landed Barney Pressman on many TV and Radio shows. Pressman claimed to be the first Manhattan retailer to use radio and television, beginning with \\"Calling All Men to Barney's\\" radio spots in the 1930s that parodied the introduction of the Dick Tracy show. He sponsored radio programs featuring Irish tenors and bands playing jigs to advertise Irish woolens. Women encased in barrels gave away matchbooks with the store name and address. He also chartered a boat to take 2,000 of his customers from Manhattan to Coney Island. During the 1960s \\"Barney‚Äôs son, Fred, helped transition from a discount store to a luxury retailer.\\" In a 1973 interview with Business Week, Fred Pressman, Barney Pressman's son, stated that he became \\"convinced that the discount route definitely was not for us. My father and I have always hated cheap goods ... I didn't want to sell low- end merchandise. Now, many of those who chose to are verging on bankruptcy.\\" Fred Pressman's obituary in The New York Times stated: > With his father's blessing, Fred Pressman slowly transformed the store from > a salty discount house that sold roast beef sandwiches in its pub to a > purveyor of Italian designers with a cafe serving Perrier and light salads. > He began to discard the types of suits that his father was prone to > unearthing at auctions and bankruptcy sales, peppering the racks instead > with then-obscure and top-name designers both, but continued to offer > touches like free alterations that gave Barneys its reputation. Pressman is quoted as saying, \\"The best value you can offer a customer is personal attention to every detail, and they will return again and again. Ultimately, the customer cares the most about how he or she is treated.\\" Pressman died in July 1996. In 1970, Barney's built a fifth story onto its original building and a five-story addition. The original store was renamed America House and the addition was named International House. The expanded store occupied the entire Seventh Avenue block (between 16th and 17th streets), with of selling space and 20 individual shops. International House, Fred Pressman promised, would feature complete collections of European designers, \\"from denim pants to $250 suits\\", not just a watered-down \\"potpourri of fabrics and models\\". The renovated America House, he said, would hold merchandise from \\"manufacturers who are in effect designers\\". By 1973, the store was stocking 60,000 suits. It carried the full lines of designers such as Bill Blass, Pierre Cardin, Christian Dior, and Hubert de Givenchy. It became the first clothing store in the U.S. to stock the full line of Giorgio Armani, after signing an agreement in 1976. Barneys is widely credited to have introduced Giorgio Armani to the American market. Women's clothing was introduced in 1976 on the third floor of the International House. In the following year, the women's store relocated to The Penthouse, a new top-level enclosure. Barney's also added housewares, cosmetics, and gift departments to the store. Also in 1977, Barney's in-store restaurant was renamed The Cafe and began selling salads, soup and sandwiches. =Barney's to Barneys= The company dropped the apostrophe in Barney's in 1981. In 1981, the women's penthouse became a duplex. Barneys imported 80% of the women's and 40% of the men's merchandise. The $25 million, women's store finally opened in 1986 in a row of six townhouses and two larger adjacent buildings across the store along 17th Street. The addition included a unisex beauty salon and restaurant, antiques, and accessories, gifts, and housewares departments. It accounted for about one-third of Barneys' sales of some $90 million the following year. In 1988, Barneys opened a men's store in the World Financial Center. The store abandoned its Seventh Avenue flagship in 1993, moving to the current , nine- story, Kohn Pederson Fox-designed Manhattan store on Madison Avenue at East 61st Street. It was the largest new store in New York City since the Great Depression. The store is a 22-story building with 14 floors of offices above the store. The wood floors, a marble mosaic on the lobby floor, gold-leaf ceilings, and lacquered walls of the new Barneys store cost $267 million. In 1989, the store formed a holding company with Japanese department store Isetan to operate stores in both countries. The first Tokyo store opened in November 1990. The agreement also called for the holding company to spend $250,000 to open 30 smaller stores of approximately . The earliest of these smaller format stores opened in Costa Mesa, California in 1990. Barneys opened its first department store outside Manhattan in Chicago, in 1993, followed by another large store in Beverly Hills, California, in 1994. The Chicago store closed in 2019. 1996 bankruptcy In 1995, the Pressman family intended to close the investment relationship with Isetan consolidating the Barneys retail business and Isetan investment in the United States real estate for the Barneys flagship stores in New York, Chicago, and Beverly Hills. At the conclusion of this consolidation, the real estate investment and the retail businesses would be held in one company. During the consolidation effort, Isetan's final funding of the real estate investment was intended to be processed through a Pressman family holding company, PREEN (Pressman Robert Eugene Elizabeth Nancy) and then directed to the real estate development. Instead of the funds flowing directly through the holding company to the real estate investment, they were given in exchange to BNY Licensing (another Pressman family company that held the Barneys trademarks) for the projected 50 year royalty stream due BNY Licensing from Isetan for their Barneys Japan business. Isetan was unaware of this transaction at the time. Isetan had reported their investment in Barneys earlier in the year as a current asset expressing their intent and belief that it would be concluded in 1995/first quarter 1996. Isetan considered the handling of the final investment a breach in trust, and stopped efforts to consolidate the investment and the Pressman family business. In December 1995, under the advice of John P. Campo of LeBeouf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae and Anthony Grillo of The Blackstone Group, the Pressmans recognizing that consolidating the investment and the business was no longer viable, voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. It was believed that, only in bankruptcy court, could the agreement between the Pressman family and Isetan be dismissed and a new agreement be authored. The strategy failed. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early January 1996. The bankruptcy allowed the company to close stores that were opened early in the company's expansion and were no longer consistent with the company's strategy. These stores included stores in Cleveland, Ohio; Costa Mesa, California; Dallas and Houston, Texas; and Short Hills, New Jersey. In subsequent years, management would re-enter some of these markets with larger flagship stores. Operations during 21st century =2000-2010= On December 20, 2004, the Pressman family sold its remaining ownership, less than 2%, to the Jones Apparel Group, which in turn sold the company in September 2007 to Dubai-based private equity firm Istithmar PJSC for $937.4 million. Included in Istithmar's purchase was an estimated $500 million in debt. \\"The luxury market took a sharp turn for the worse after Istithmar's acquisition of Barneys. U.S. sales of high end clothing, fragrances and accessories slipped 14% in 2009, according to Bain & Co. Although luxury was a star performer over the 2010 holiday season, spending trends have yet to recover to pre-recessionary levels. The privately held company doesn't reveal financial results but said that EBITDA rose by $30 million in 2010.\\" =2010-2019= Howard Socol, Barneys' former CEO, resigned shortly after the change in ownership. The company failed to fill the position for over two years until it appointed Mark Lee to the post in September 2010. Lee is the former chief executive of Gucci Group and has consulted and sat on the board of many other fashion companies. After Lee's appointment, Barneys experienced changes in its staff, advertising, and website. Amanda Brooks, former creative director of Hogan, replaced longtime fashion director, Julie Gilhart. Lee's former Gucci colleague, Daniella Vitale, replaced Judy Collinson as head merchant. Former creative director Simon Doonan, now creative ambassador-at-large, was replaced by Dennis Freedman. Barney's advertisements and catalogs are usually shot in- house, but for Spring 2011 candid shots by art photographers such as William Klein, Nan Goldin and Juergen Teller were taken behind-the-scenes during New York Fashion Week. Some existing stores will face new renovations such as the in Madison Avenue location's main floor and Co-Op levels. The traditional red awnings have been changed to black. Barneys' website has been revamped and has launched a new site called \\"The Window\\" which is the retailer's primary \\"social media landing page\\"‚Äîa window into the Barneys world, with news about fashion and happenings at Barneys stores. As of February 2011, Barneys no longer sold Prada (with the exception of shoes and menswear) because of disagreements concerning prices and inventory control. Prada wanted to lease space, but control its own inventory and markdowns under a concession model. Barneys declined. In May 2012, Perry Capital acquired a majority ownership of the company which reduced its $590 million debt to $50 million. It will have three seats on the seven-member board. The former majority owner Istithmar World as well as new investor Yucaipa Cos will also be on the board as will current executive chairman Mark Lee. In December 2013, Women's Wear Daily announced that the retailer would return to the portion of its original Seventh Avenue site being vacated by bankrupt Loehmann's. In January 2014, Barneys was to use transgender models in advertisement for its 2014 advertisement campaign. In February 2016, Barneys New York returned to its original Seventh Avenue location in Chelsea opening a four-story Flagship store. Daniella Vitale was named chief executive officer, succeeding Lee, in February 2017. The company closed in 2019. 2019 bankruptcy On August 6, 2019, Barneys New York filed for bankruptcy once more. Fifteen stores closed as part of the bankruptcy filing, including Barneys flagship stores in Las Vegas, Chicago, and Seattle; smaller-format stores in Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia; and all but two of its outlet stores.Barneys files for bankruptcy CNBC, 2019/08/06 On 25 October 2019, Authentic Brands Group announced it had won the bidding process ($271.4 million bid). Authentic Brands Group has said it would close all seven remaining Barneys stores and license the retailer's intellectual property to Saks Fifth Avenue.Sam Ben- Avraham Tells Us How He Plans to Save Barneys Highsnobiety, Jian DeLeon, October 2019Authentic Brands Declares Victory In Barneys Auction; Rivals Don‚Äôt Concede William Sprouse, CFO, October 25, 2019 The New York Times reported that Authentic Brands Group's strategy is \\"essentially betting that the future of retail lies with the abstract values of brand names rather than in-person shopping experiences.\\" Barneys Bidding Starts, and It‚Äôs a Bet on the Future of Shopping The New York Times, Vanessa Friedman and Sapna Maheshwari, October 15, 2019 Following its 2019 liquidation, it was reported that in Manhattan, Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdales, Saks, the new Neiman Marcus and the new Nordstrom were hoping to attract former Barneys shoppers.Can Bergdorf Goodman Win the Barneys Race? The New York Times, Sapna Maheshwari, December 12, 2019 Stores Prior to its liquidation, Barneys New York operated five flagship department stores in the United States. Freds restaurants operated inside of the Beverly Hills, Chicago, Madison Avenue, Downtown NY, and San Francisco locations. In 2014, the company announced plans for a flagship department store at Bal Harbour Shops in Bal Harbour, Florida as part of a planned expansion of that shopping center. The store was to open in 2023 with the new portions of the center. Barneys New York closed its flagship store at Northpark Center in Dallas in 2013. Its store at Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, Arizona followed in 2016. The company opened a freestanding men's store in San Francisco in February 2016, and in summer 2018 announced it would add a restaurant. Two warehouse stores operated in addition to the company's full-line business. Six full-line Barneys stores and six warehouse stores operate in its Japan division. As of 2020, Barneys Japan is still operating under Seven & I Holdings Co., which also operates Sogo and Seibu Department Stores. Before going out of business Barney's announced a new location at the American Dream shopping and entertainment complex in New Jersey, this was supposed to be the only location in the state of New Jersey, before pulling out of the complex in October of 2019. Barneys New York CO-OP Established in 1986, the Barneys New York CO-OP originally existed as the contemporary department within Barneys flagship stores. Created to house trendier and less expensive product than the rest of the store, the CO-OP was aimed at younger shoppers with smaller budgets than a traditional Barneys customer. The CO-OP department was spun-off into a separate chain of stores in the 2000s, primarily located in shopping malls and lifestyle centers. At its height, there were more than 20 CO-OP stores throughout the United States. In 2013, Barneys retired the CO-OP name. Several CO-OPs were converted into boutique versions of the flagship Barneys New York brand, but most closed. Controversies =Use of \\"Co-op\\" in name= The 2010 opening of the Brooklyn, New York CO-OP location raised some concerns among members of the Park Slope Food Coop regarding the use of the term \\"co-op\\" by a for-profit corporation. According to the general manager of the Food Coop, Barneys's use of the term is a violation of the New York State Cooperative Corporations Law. =Racial profiling= Barneys was repeatedly accused of racially profiling its customers throughout the years. In 1996, Johnnie Roberts, a journalist for Newsweek, published an account of an incident taking place in the spring of 1990 in which he was mistakenly accused of shoplifting because he is African American. In 2013, Trayon Christian, a 19-year-old African American, purchased a $350 Ferragamo belt and was arrested shortly after leaving the store. The police had received a call from the store claiming that the debit card used was fraudulent, even though the customer provided proper identification at the time of the purchase. The officers questioned Christian on how he was able to afford the purchased belt, and accused him of using a fraudulent card. He was handcuffed, detained in a holding cell for two hours and interrogated further. He was later released after the police contacted Chase Bank to verify ownership of the card. Another African American shopper, Kayla Phillips, came forward with a similar claim after she purchased a $2,500 C√©line handbag with her debit card. Both shoppers believe they were targeted because of their race after they purchased costly items and have stated they intend on filing discrimination lawsuits against the store. As a result of these high-profile cases, Al Sharpton threatened to boycott the store in October 2013. Sharpton compared Barneys practice of racial profiling to the controversial stop-and- frisk policy practiced by the NYPD. Within days of Sharpton‚Äôs boycott announcement, fans petitioned rapper and businessman Jay-Z to sever ties with the retailer with whom he had a partnership. Jay-Z responded saying that he would look into the matter more thoroughly rather than make a snap judgment stating, \\"I move and speak based on facts and not emotion.\\" In November 2013, Jay-Z stated that his deal with Barneys would continue as planned, with the condition that he be placed in a leadership role on a committee specifically organized to deal with racial profiling in the store. Other conditions required that all of the proceeds of the BNY SCC collection be donated to Jay-Z's charity, the Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. This was a major increase from the 25% of the proceeds that was initially agreed upon. As well, Barneys agreed to donate 10% of all retail of all stores nationwide as well as its web store, Barneys.com, on November 20, 2013, which would guarantee a total of at least one million dollars. =Live butterfly display= In 2018, Barneys used live butterflies to introduce a new line of jewelry and accessories, asking customers and employees to interact with monarch butterflies as they flitted around display cases in the Beverly Hills store. PETA reported \\"that there were many dead and dying butterflies languishing around the display area, behind plants and in plant beds.\\" Barneys responded by banning the use of live butterflies from any future promotions and making a donation to PETA as an apology. = Labor issues = The union busting firm Kulture Consulting, LLC was hired in 2015. According to a Department of Labor document, Kulture ‚Äúpresented informational meetings to company employees relative to the process of unionization‚Äù at Barney's locations in Beverly Hills, Chicago, Las Vegas, and San Francisco. In Chicago representatives from the labor union Workers United reported that \\"management called workers into one-on-one meetings\\" and engaged in \\"scare tactics\\". In December 2018, Barneys hired Kulture Consulting to present \\"informational meetings\\" with employees at its Las Vegas location.

The finished product can take a smooth polish and be carved into beads, figurines, or other artifacts suitable for semiprecious stone, and in fact goldstone is often mistaken for or misrepresented as a natural material.  Nomenclature  Another common name for the material is aventurine glass, based on the original Italian name avventurina (from avventura, \\"adventure\\" or \\"chance\\"). It is called \\"del-roba\\" (Persian: ÿØŸÑÿ±ÿ®ÿß) in Persian which means \\"Charming\\"; or \\"monk's gold\\" or \\"monkstone\\" from folkloric associations with an unnamed monastic order. The material is sometimes called sandstone when used in watch dials, despite its lack of resemblance to the porous, matte texture of the natural stone. Additionally, \\"aventurine\\" glass is one of the few synthetic simulants to provide the eponym for the similar natural stones. The mineral name \\"aventurine\\" is used for forms of feldspar or quartz with mica inclusions that give a similar glittering appearance; the technical term for this optical phenomenon, \\"aventurescence\\", is also derived from the same source.  Production  One original manufacturing process for goldstone was invented in seventeenth- century Venice by the Miotti family, which was granted an exclusive license by the Doge. Urban legend says goldstone was an accidental discovery by unspecified Italian monks or the product of alchemy, but there is no pre- Miotti documentation to confirm this. A goldstone amulet from 12th- to 13th- century Persia in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania shows that other, earlier artisans were also able to create the material.University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Philadelphia The most common form of goldstone is reddish-brown, containing tiny crystals of metallic copper that require special conditions to form properly. The initial batch is melted together from silica, copper oxide, and other metal oxides to chemically reduce the copper ions to elemental copper. The vat is then sealed off from the air and maintained within a narrow temperature range, keeping the glass hot enough to remain liquid while allowing metallic crystals to precipitate from solution without melting or oxidizing. After a suitable crystallization period, the entire batch is cooled to a single solid mass, which is then broken out of the vat for selection and shaping. The final appearance of each batch is highly variable and heterogenous. The best material is near the center or \\"heart\\" of the mass, ideally with large, bright metal crystals suspended in a semitransparent glass matrix.  Variations  = Copper colloid size and failure modes = Copper-based \\"red goldstone\\" aventurine glass exists on a structural continuum with transparent red copper ruby glass and opaque \\"sealing wax\\" purpurin glass, all of which are striking glasses, the reddish colors of which are created by colloidal copper. The key variable is controlling the colloid size: goldstone has macroscopic reflective crystals; purpurin glass has microscopic opaque particles; copper ruby glass has submicroscopic transparent nanoparticles. The outer layers of a goldstone batch tend to have duller colors and a lower degree of glittery aventurescence. This can be caused by poor crystallization, which simultaneously decreases the size of reflective crystals and opacifies the surrounding glass with non reflective particles. It can also be caused by partial oxidation of the copper, causing it to redissolve and form its usual transparent blue-green glass in ionic solution. When reheated for lamp-working and similar uses, the working conditions should control the temperature and oxidation as required for the original batch melt: keep the temperature below the melting point of copper (1084.62 ¬∞C) and use an oxygen-poor reducing flame, or risk decomposition into the failure modes described above. =Non- copper goldstones= Tumble polished blue Goldstone pieces. Goldstone also exists in other color variants based on other elements. Cobalt or manganese can be substituted for copper; the resulting crystals have a more silvery appearance and are suspended in a strongly colored matrix of the corresponding ionic color, resulting in blue goldstone or purple goldstone respectively. Green goldstone, or chrome aventurine, forms its reflective particles from chromium oxides rather than the elemental metal, but is otherwise fairly similar.MJ Pelouze, \\"On A New Aventurine, With Chrome as the Base\\". Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science. 1865, pages 455-6 The non- copper goldstones are easier to work with when reheated, due to the less stringent reduction requirements and higher melting points of manganese (1246 ¬∞C) and cobalt (1495 ¬∞C).

In the fall of 1901, the Paris money lender filed suit against Gwynne, for an unpaid loan of nearly $50,000 for diamonds.

However, in February 1908, the Paris money lender revived his legal attack against the Gwynnes, demanding their property on the unpaid loan of $40,000. In March, following a long discussion, the suit against the Gwynnes was dismissed. The judge ruled that the realty transfer performed by Edward to his mother was not made with the intent to defraud creditors. However, he also spoke rather harshly of Preston's father, referring to him as a man who \\"may have had large expectancies, but seems to have been a drain upon his mother's financial resources\\".

The TV dinner business is currently owned by Pinnacle Foods, while the broth business is currently owned by the Campbell Soup Company. Current TV dinner products sold under the brand include Swanson's Classics TV dinners and pot pies, and the current broth lineup includes chicken broth and beef broth. History Swanson chicken pot pie Carl A. Swanson (1879 ‚Äì 1949) was a Swedish immigrant who worked on a farm in Blair, Nebraska, until he moved to Omaha.Andrew F. Smith, Eating History (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009), 170 There, he worked in a grocery store where he came into contact with John O. Jerpe, who owned a small commission company, in which Swanson would become a partner in 1899. Initially, the Jerpe Commission Company purchased eggs and cream from local farmers. In turn, they processed the eggs, made butter from the cream, and sold these products to distributors and charged a commission to the farmers. With Swanson as a partner in the company, it began to expand. The Jerpe Commission Company began to sell chicken, turkey, and other meat. Swanson would eventually buy the company from Jerpe and rename it C.A. Swanson and Sons, as his sons Gilbert and Clarke had joined the business. =World War II= The frozen food industry began to dramatically change surrounding the time of World War II. As men were required on the battlefield, women became more needed in the workforce.Laurent Gust, ‚ÄúDefrosting Dinner: The Evolution of Frozen Meals in America‚Äù Intersect 4 (2011): 51 This limited the amount of available time women could spend preparing meals for their children. Women began to rely on TV dinners post-war for greater convenience, and to save time. =Frozen dinners= Carl Swanson died in 1949, and his sons Gilbert C. and W. Clarke took over the company. After the war ended, Jerpe was renamed C.A. Swanson & Sons. One year later, in 1950, the Swanson brothers initially began manufacturing frozen oven-ready chicken and turkey pot pies in aluminum trays.Andrew F. Smith, Eating History (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009), 171. They branched into full meals after Swanson executive Gerry Thomas visited the distributor of a company that specialized in preparing food for airlines. The company packed the food in aluminum trays which could be heated in a conventional oven. Thomas proposed this idea to the Swanson brothers, suggesting they create an aluminum tray with three compartments: one compartment for frozen turkey slices and the other two for side dishes. The Swanson Company's first frozen dinner was a turkey dinner; eventually, the company added chicken and beef entr√©es.Andrew F. Smith, Eating History (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009), 172. With over half of American households owning televisions by the 1950s, the Swanson brothers called their frozen meals \\"TV dinners,\\" suitable for eating on a folding tray in one's living room while watching television.Horwitz, Jamie (2009)\\"Eating at the Edge\\" Gastronomica: The Journal of Critical Food Studies 9 (2009): 44 =TV dinner brand= A Swanson \\"Hungry-Man Country Fried Chicken\\" TV dinner The Swanson & Sons' TV dinner branded frozen meal, sold 5,000 units when it was first introduced in 1953; just one year later, the company had sold over 10,000,000 TV dinners. The company discontinued its successful butter and margarine business to concentrate on a poultry-based line of canned and frozen products. In April 1955, Swanson's 4,000 employees and 20 plants were acquired by the Campbell Soup Company. By 1956, the Swanson brothers were selling 13 million TV dinners annually. For the majority of its run, Swanson sponsored the game show, The Name's the Same, with Robert Q. Lewis, alternating sponsorship with the Bendix Home Appliance division of Avco, and then Johnson's Wax. In a few 1980s and 1990s commercials for the TV dinner, the announcer was Mason Adams. =1970s to present= When Swanson's TV dinners launched in the 1950s, the product competed primarily with home-cooked food, and was developed with a relatively low price point for the consumer. By the 1970s, however, the increasing number of two-income families and single working parents shifted competition to restaurant food, either eaten at the restaurant or ordered to take home. During this period, American consumers were increasingly exposed to a greater variety of international cuisines and more sophisticated flavors, and the consumer was also growing more nutrition- conscious and discerning. Competing in this new environment required more expensive ingredients, but Swanson was slow to change its traditional menus, and slow to recognize the increasing importance of the microwave oven in the heat-and-eat food market. It continued to use non-microwaveable foil trays long after competitors had adopted microwaveable paper and plastic trays. Swanson eventually introduced a new line of frozen dinners called \\"Le Menu\\" in the 1980s which featured more sophisticated menus on undivided plastic microwavable plates with lids. But by then, the company was competing with many other strong brands, such as Stouffer's. Stouffer's had also begun targeting the diet market with its reduced-calorie Lean Cuisine frozen meal line. Swanson trailed behind these developments. In March 1998, Campbell Soup spun off the Swanson frozen meal business along with several other brands, including Vlasic, to a company called Vlasic Foods International; the company was re-branded Pinnacle Foods in 2001. In the spin-off, Campbell Soup granted Pinnacle a ten-year license to use the Swanson name on frozen meals and pot pies. That agreement expired in mid-2009, just before Pinnacle purchased Birds Eye Foods. Pinnacle continued to produce frozen meals, but it discontinued the use of the Swanson name in favor of the Hungry-Man brand; however, it remains in use for pot pies. Swanson's frozen breakfast line was re-branded Aunt Jemima several years before. International operations A bus advertising Swanson broth in Hong Kong in 2008 Adolf Ho Ping-yau, managing director for the Campbell Soup Company in Hong Kong, introduced the Swanson brand to Hong Kong in 1987. Ho introduced Swanson chicken broth to the Hong Kong market following a visit to a Campbell's factory in the United States, in which he saw excess chicken soup created during the production of TV dinners going to waste due to a lack of demand for chicken broth in the US. As of 2004, Swanson chicken broth is Campbell's best-selling product in Hong Kong, and the Swanson line of soup products have a market share of 90% in Hong Kong. In popular culture Swanson products were the subject of a 2016 comedy routine by Jerry Seinfeld on The Late Show. Superfast Jellyfish, a song by virtual band Gorillaz, primarily samples some of Swanson's breakfast advertisements. Tributes A branch of the Omaha Public Library is named for W.

Located far from almost all human development, the Thelon and its surroundings are entirely pristine wilderness. It has been described as Canada's remotest river. The river has a width of up to a kilometre (0.6 mi) along much of its lower section, widening into Beverly, Aberdeen, and Schultz Lakes about upstream from its mouth at Baker Lake. Fauna Approximately 100 moose and more than 2,000 muskoxen forage on the land around the Thelon. 300,000 migrating barren- ground caribou cross the river every fall and spring. History The Inuit people, including Caribou Inuit and Copper Inuit, have long occupied the sparsely-populated lands around the Thelon. Artifacts of Inuit hunting and travel (including inukshuk guide stones) are readily observed near the river. In 1770‚Äì71, English explorer Samuel Hearne crossed the Thelon while exploring Canada's northern interior. Over the winter of 1926‚Äì27, John Hornby starved to death on the Thelon along with two other men. They had planned to hunt migrating caribou, but failed to find the herd. Nevertheless, on the basis of Hornby's earlier explorations with James Charles Critchell Bullock in 1923, the Thelon Game Sanctuary was established in 1927, renamed the Thelon Wildlife Sanctuary in 1956. In 1927(?), the Norwegian explorer and writer Helge Ingstad went by dog sled to the headwaters of the Thelon (Lynx Lake) together with native peoples from the east end of Great Slave Lake. This he detailed in his book The Land of Feast and Famine. Tourism In 1990, the lower of the Thelon were designated a Canadian Heritage River. Although there is no road access to the river, a number of wilderness campers and canoeists visit the Thelon every summer.  Cultural references  The basin of the Thelon is mentioned in the 1979 sci-fi novel Beetle in the Anthill by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky as the location of the embassy of Golovans: intelligent canoid (dog-like) race evolved at Saraksh planet.

The highlands around the Tetovo, Peƒá and Prizren areas √áelebi considered as being the \\"mountains of Arnavudluk\\". √áelebi referred to the \\"mountains of Peƒá\\" as being in Arnavudluk and considered the Ibar river that converged in Mitrovica as forming Kosovo's border with Bosnia. He viewed the \\"Kƒ±lab\\" or Lab river as having its source in Arnavudluk and by extension the Sitnica as being part of that river. √áelebi also included the central mountains of Kosovo within Arnavudluk. During Ottoman rule the area of Kosovo was referred to as Arnavudluk (ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸàŸàÿØŸÑŸÇ) meaning Albania by the empire in its documents such as those dating from the eighteenth century. p.88, 107 \\"In light of the recent violent troubles in Kosovo and Macedonia and the strong emotions tied to them, readers are urged most emphatically not to draw either of two unwarranted conclusions from this article: that Albanians are somehow inherently inclined to banditry, or that the extent of Ottoman \\"Albania\\" or Arnavudluk (which included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia) gives any historical \\"justification\\" for the creation of a \\"Greater Albania\\" today.\\" p.772. p. 41. \\"Anscombe (ibid., 107 n. 3) notes that Ottoman \\"Albania\\" or Arnavudluk... included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia\\"; see also El2. s.v. \\"Arnawutluk. 6.

For the Byzantine period. see Psimouli, Souli. 28.\\"  Gegalik (Geg√´nia)  In the late Ottoman period Albanians claimed the sancaks of Yeni Pazar (Novi Pazar), Ipek (Peƒá/Peja), Prizren, Pri»ôtine (Pristina) and √úsk√ºp (Skopje) which were all within Kosovo Vilayet as forming part of Gegalƒ±k or Land of the Gegs, a term named after Gheg Albanians who inhabited the area. Dardania There is a theory within linguistics that the name Dardania used in ancient times for the area of Kosovo is derived from the Albanian word dardh√´, meaning \\"pear\\".Albanian Etymological Dictionary, V.Orel, Koninklijke Brill, Leiden Boston K√∂ln 1998, p.56 \\"Names of individuals peoples may have been formed in a similar fashion, Taulantii from ‚Äòswallow‚Äô (cf. the Albanian tallandushe) or Erchelei the ‚Äòeel-men‚Äô and Chelidoni the ‚Äòsnail-men‚Äô. The name of the Delmatae appears connected with the Albanian word for ‚Äòsheep‚Äô delm√´) and the Dardanians with for ‚Äòpear‚Äô (dardh√´).\\" Due to its Slavic (Serbian) character, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova supported a name change to \\"Dardania\\", in reference to the ancient kingdom and later-turned Roman province. Albanian nationalists seek to remove Serbian terminology (and toponomy) in Kosovo. It, however, did not enter into general usage. Kosovo and Metohija The name \\"Kosovo and Metohija\\" was used for the autonomous province in Yugoslav Serbia since its creation in 1945 until 1968, when the term \\"Metohija\\" was dropped. In 1990, the name was reversed to \\"Kosovo and Metohija\\". After the Kosovo War, the United Nations mission used only \\"Kosovo\\" as the name of the province.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 1, 2005, and guest-stars comedian Ray Romano. The episode is a parody of the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind. Plot A major thunderstorm hits Springfield, and Marge demands that Homer fix their leaking roof. Homer attempts to solve the problem by using Hot Wheels ramps to transport all the draining water from the roof to the front yard through the hallway, the stairway and the mail slot on the front door. Though this plan seems to work well, Lisa's hamster slides down the ramps to the front yard by accident. Shocked, Lisa opens the front door to save her hamster, breaking all the ramps, and leaving the house all wet. Marge berates Homer for not providing a more sensible solution to fix the roof. Angered, Homer decides to go to Moe's Tavern, but is kicked out when he sits on Lenny's birthday cake by accident, shaped in the form of Lenny's favourite bar stool. Feeling depressed, Homer finds another bar, \\"Knockers\\" (A parody of the restaurant Hooters), where he meets a friendly man named Ray Magini. The two talk, and Homer finds out that Ray is a roofer, so Homer asks him to fix his leak. Ray agrees. The next day, Homer assures Marge that his new friend will be taking care of the roof. Ray, however, does not arrive until everyone else has left. The two of them get up on the roof and use nail guns to nail the boards onto the roof, but they start shooting nails at each other, some hitting Ned Flanders' lawn mower next door. Ray leaves later and, as Homer runs on the roof, he crashes through the small part of the roof that they fixed, making the hole bigger. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids leave Santa's Little Helper with Grampa and the Springfield Retirement Home residents, because they seem to like him. When Marge sees the hole, she tells Homer to fix it himself, because she sees no reason to believe that his friend will. The next day, Bart and Homer go to the Builder's Barn, and Homer meets Ray there. Ray apologizes to Homer for having not finished the job and promises he will stop by soon to work on the roof. Lisa, Marge, and Maggie arrive back at the retirement home, only to discover that Santa's Little Helper has become one of the old people. They permanently take him back home. After waiting a long while for Ray to show on the roof, Marge becomes worried about Homer, and tells him that Ray is just a figment of his imagination. When Homer refuses to believe it, he falls off the roof and is knocked unconscious. Marge then takes Homer to the Calmwood Mental Hospital. Dr. Hibbert tells him that Ray does not exist; he was created by Homer's mind as Homer was feeling lonely and unappreciated because of the previous events he had endured. All the people that Homer thinks saw Ray - Bart, Ned, and the \\"Knockers\\" bartender - claim they did not, and Lisa reveals that \\"Ray Magini\\" is an anagram for \\"imaginary\\". Six weeks and several hours of shock therapy later, Homer is now sure that Ray does not exist. As he is being discharged, he sees Ray again in the room. Angered by the pain the \\"figment of his imagination\\" has caused him, he assaults him. In retaliation, Ray knocks Homer out and everyone is surprised they can see him too. He did really exist the whole time: the bartender did not see Ray as he had an eye patch on (while looking in the direction of Homer and Ray that night, Ray was before his covered eye), and Ray could not be seen by Ned because he was behind the chimney. Bart still viewed Homer with skepticism for talking to thin air, but Stephen Hawking arrives and says that Bart could not see Ray at the hardware store because of a miniature black hole caused directly behind Ray which absorbed the light from Ray and made it look as though Homer was talking to himself when Homer was actually talking to Ray. Marge asks Ray why he started fixing the roof, and then just disappeared. Ray says he is a contractor. Everyone laughs, and Marge says \\"That's right, you're all crooks!\\" Hibbert, seeing how angry Homer is as he was made to go through shock treatment for nothing, offers to make it up to him by doing a free eye scraping for him. Homer agrees on it, but also forces Hibbert to fix the roof without any breaks while Ray and Homer discuss Everybody Loves Raymond on the roof. Production Although it was advertised as the 350th episode, it was actually the 351st episode to air (\\"Future-Drama\\" is the 350th and \\"The Heartbroke Kid\\" is the 352nd). The real 350th episode (in production code order) is \\"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star\\", which was temporarily shelved following the death of Pope John Paul II. Cultural referencesThe title of the episode is a reference to the song \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\" by Blue √ñyster Cult. The song played over the end credits of \\"The Parent Rap\\". *Homer and Ray discuss guest star Ray Romano's sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, which aired its final episode two weeks later. In the original airing of the episode, Ray begins telling Homer to watch the show \\"while you still can\\" as the episode ends, and keeps repeating to Homer when Everybody Loves Raymond airs (aired) on CBS, while Homer keeps messing up the day and time, during the closing credits. While some repeats have included this material, other viewings have edited out both parts because of Everybody Loves Raymonds having finished its network run long ago. =Edits= On the United Kingdom's Channel 4, and in American syndication on Fox affiliates, the entire post-credit conversation between Homer and Ray about CBS's Everybody Loves Raymond was re-dubbed with the traditional end music for the show. However, when the episode aired on Sky1, the original end credits were used. Reception Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 16th season.

He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became principal of years later). and a prefect while at Raffles Institution.. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, \\"When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and you look like you might be a lawyer; would you like to do law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to give me the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law.\\".

In November 1990, Woon appeared before the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Bill (Bill No. 23/90) to make representations on the proposed introduction of an elected President for Singapore. He took the view that since the elected President should be politically neutral, Cabinet members should only be eligible to stand for election five years after leaving politics.. The report of the Select Committee was published as . Never afraid to speak his mind, in July 1991 in an interview by The Straits Times Woon commented: \\"We effectively don't have a Constitution. We have a law that can be easily changed by Parliament, and by the party in power because the party is Parliament. The changes themselves might not be controversial, but it is unsettling how flexible the Constitution is, unlike, say, in the United States.\\". In reply, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pointed out that past changes to the Constitution had been made only with a two-thirds parliamentary majority and not done lightheartedly, as the intensive discussions and the two-year gestation period of the Elected President Bill proved. He affirmed that the Constitution had to evolve to reflect the changing needs of the people, and that it could not be assumed that the Constitution, drafted in 1965, would be the best Constitution for always and should be frozen in time. \\"So to say that because the Government in power changes the Constitution there is no Constitution is ridiculous, to put it mildly.\\". =Nominated Member of Parliament= Parliament House, December 2005 Woon was a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) for three terms, from 7 September 1992 to 6 September 1994, from 7 September 1994 to 6 September 1996, and from 7 September 1996 till 15 December 1996 when Parliament was dissolved for the 1997 general election.; ; .

In 1992 at the start of the Government's annual Speak Mandarin Campaign, the Minister for Information and the Arts George Yeo said in a newspaper article that the rising use of English by Chinese Singaporeans was a \\"disturbing trend\\" as \\"[w]e become very exposed to Western cultural influences via books, magazines and films. Some influences are good. Others are harmful, especially to the structure of the family.\\". This provoked Woon to respond that \\"[t]he subliminal message being sent is that those who speak English are dangerous to society and that the wider use of English threatens the social fabric of Singapore\\". He deplored this view because good values were neither Asian nor Western: \\"Why should we confine ourselves to one or the other? Singapore isn't a Western society. It isn't an Asian society. It is a cosmopolitan society.\\" He noted that \\"[t]he emancipation of women, the rule of law, the equality of citizens irrespective of race, language or religion, the right to representative government: These are values we have adopted from the 'decadent' West.\\". George Yeo responded in . In September 1992, Woon was appointed to the select committee to review the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill No. 33/92) which proposed, among other things, that scripless trading in securities listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore be authorised so that share transfers can be made through computerised book entries..

On 23 May 1994, Woon moved a Private Member's Bill which was eventually passed by Parliament on 2 November 1995 as the Maintenance of Parents Act.. The Act, which entitles parents at least 60 years old and unable to maintain themselves adequately to apply to a tribunal for their children to be ordered to pay maintenance to them, was the first public law that originated from a private member's bill since Singapore's independence in 1965.. The first ever Act since 1965 originating from a private member's bill was the Roman Catholic Archbishop Bill introduced by P. Selvadurai and Chiang Hai Ding in 1974 and passed the following year as the Roman Catholic Archbishop Act (now ). This was a private act, not a public one: Chia, ibid. See also ; ; ; . In its 5 December 1994 issue, Time magazine picked Woon as one of 100 young world leaders, the only Singaporean to make the list.. From 1995 to 1997, Woon was Legal Adviser to the President of Singapore and Council of Presidential Advisors. During this time, he represented the President as junior counsel before the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal in Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995,[1995] 1 S.L.R.(R) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 803. which involved the interpretation of provisions of the Constitution of Singapore touching on the ability of Parliament to curtail the President's discretionary powers. =Diplomat= The Embassy of Singapore in Berlin in Philip-Johnson-Haus on Friedrichstra√üe Between September 1997 and September 2006, Woon was seconded to the Foreign Service.

Three months into the job, he created some controversy when delivering an off-the-cuff speech at the launch of the Law Society of Singapore's Public and International Law Committee. He said: In mid-May, Woon commented that an acquitted person may not be guilty in law, but guilty in fact. Two months later, without referring directly to these remarks, Judge of Appeal V.K. Rajah wrote in a judgment that such comments could undermine confidence in the courts' verdicts and the criminal justice system, which was based on the doctrine of the presumption of innocence.XP v. Public Prosecutor [2008] 4 S.L.R.(R) 686 at para. 98, High Court: \\"The question for the court in every case is not whether it suspects the accused has committed the crime but whether the Prosecution has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that he has indeed committed it. It is trite that courts can never convict on the basis of suspicion and/or intuition. Such is the conclusion demanded by and enshrined in that cardinal principle, the presumption of innocence, upon which is founded the most elemental rule of the criminal justice system: that the Prosecution must establish guilt beyond any reasonable doubt. Objective and not subjective belief is the essential touchstone of guilt, and there is simply no place for subsequent speculation or implication that an acquitted accused may be 'factually guilty'.\\" See also . The Minister for Law K. Shanmugam was asked in Parliament on 25 August 2008 to clarify the Attorney- General's comments. Shanmugam described the presumption of innocence as an \\"important and fundamental principle\\" which the Government was \\"absolutely committed to upholding\\". Nonetheless, it was \\"entirely possible for a person to have committed acts which amount to a crime and yet, there may be no conviction\\", as the trial process was designed to prove guilt and not innocence. He added: \\"It is for the courts, and the courts alone, to exercise judicial power and decide the question of guilt, in a trial.\\". With effect from 20 May 2008, Woon was appointed a director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.. He also served on the Presidential Council for Minority Rights between 2008 and 2010. The Attorney-General's Chambers were formerly located in The Adelphi on Coleman Street Woon was the first Attorney-General in more than ten years to personally appear in court. On 28 July 2008, he argued before the Court of Appeal that a woman who had manipulated her teenage lover into killing her husband should be given a life sentence.Woon represented the State four times in court when he was Second Solicitor-General and Solicitor- General: ; ; . The Court held that a life sentence was inappropriate due to the defendant's psychiatric condition, and affirmed the nine-year jail term imposed by the High Court.Public Prosecutor v. Aniza bte Essa [2009] 3 S.L.R.(R) 327, Court of Appeal. The High Court's decision was reported as Public Prosecutor v. Aniza bte Essa [2008] 3 S.L.R.(R) 832. Woon elected to take proceedings against Tang Wee Sung, chairman of the company C.K. Tang which owns Tangs department store, for the illegal purchase of a human organ ‚Äì a kidney ‚Äì in the first case of its kind in Singapore.Tang was convicted of agreeing to pay for the supply of a kidney and sentenced to a fine of S$7,000; and for making false statements in a statutory declaration, for which he received one day's imprisonment and a $10,000 fine: Public Prosecutor v. Tang Wee Sung [2008] SGDC 262. The decision to do so was criticised by Dr. Lee Wei Ling, Director of the National Neuroscience Institute and daughter of Minister Mentor and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in an article published in The Straits Times on 5 September 2008.. Woon replied, pointing out a number of misconceptions she held as to the facts and the law, and emphasising that the prosecution had been brought as no one was above the law.. Subsequently, in response to further comments by Dr. Lee,. he wrote an extended article entitled \\"Wrong Facts and Faulty Logic\\" that appeared in The Straits Times on 18 September 2008.. A longer version is available on the website of the Attorney-General's Chambers as .

At the third annual Singapore Children's Society Lecture entitled \\"Changing Social Mores: Protecting Children from Themselves?\\" on 31 October 2009, Woon expressed the view that prosecuting teenagers from having underage sex with each other served little purpose. \\"It's basically kids having sex ... What do you do if the couple think they're in love? It's less easy if the girl consents. ... The judges cannot do very much by themselves. Sending them [the teenagers] to jail per se will not make them reflect on their lives. That is the last thing that is going to happen. But good or ill, this is the framework that we have.\\". Woon established a new division in the Attorney-General's Chambers for the prosecution of cases in the Subordinate Courts of Singapore to enhance the development of criminal litigation skills, and recruited a number of young and talented lawyers into the Singapore Legal Service. In 2008 he hosted the International Association of Prosecutors Conference in Singapore. He also assisted in the setting up of the Centre for International Law at NUS to improve international law expertise in Singapore and the region. He was Singapore's alternate representative on the High Level Task Force for the Drafting of the ASEAN Charter, a key constitutional document for ASEAN, which was signed in November 2007. Subsequently, he co-authored a book entitled The Making of the ASEAN Charter (2009).. Woon stepped down as Attorney-General on 10 April 2010 after a two-year term. In a media interview, he said that the post \\"was not a job I really wanted or enjoyed. I did it because I was asked to do the job. So I did my best under the circumstances with what I had.\\". See also ; ; ; ; . When asked whether he had \\"annoyed the powers that be\\", he said: He subsequently clarified that when he said he had outstayed his welcome he had been \\"thinking more about the people I prosecuted rather than anything else\\", and that \\"I was kidding, I was being facetious\\".; . For comment, see . =Return to academia= The National University of Singapore Faculty of Law at the University's Bukit Timah Campus, which Woon rejoined full-time in 2010 Woon returned to academia at NUS, and was appointed the first Dean of the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE), a company incorporated by the Singapore Academy of Law on 18 January 2010 to manage the postgraduate practical training of graduates from local and overseas universities seeking admission to the Singapore Bar, training contracts, and continuing legal education for practising lawyers.. He has denied any intention to enter politics ‚Äì \\"Why would I leave one hot seat to jump into another hot seat? I've said for years that I would want to go back to my natural habitat eventually. Why wouldn't anyone believe me?\\" ‚Äì although when asked if he had forever ruled out a political career, he said: \\"Forever is a long time but definitely not now.\\". Subsequently, he reiterated in a Today interview: \\"I am not a politician and I am not interested in politics and have no desire to go into politics. I do not know why people do not believe me when I say so. I have said it a thousand times but people do not seem to believe me.\\". Woon is currently Chairman of the Singapore International Law Society (since 2006), Judge Advocate General (since 2007), and President of the Goethe Institute Singapore (since 2010). In 2015, Woon joined RHTLaw TaylorWessing LLP, one of the few largest law firms in Singapore, as its non-executive Chairman and Senior Consultant. In September 2017, Woon wrote a piece in The Straits Times illuminating how the office of the Attorney-General carries out its prosecutorial function, and suggesting that this could be separated from its other role as legal advisor to the Government. Fiction writing Woon won a consolation prize for a short story called The Body in Question which he submitted for the 1985 National Short Story Writing Competition.. The National Library holds an unpublished microfilm copy shelved at NL27697. In 2002, he published his first novel, The Advocate's Devil.. This was followed three years later by The Devil to Pay (2005). Both books are crime novels set in 1930s Singapore with Dennis Chiang, an English-educated Peranakan lawyer, as the protagonist. Woon has said that fiction writing was \\"something I did on the side when I got tired of writing non-fiction\\". A reviewer of The Advocate's Devil commented: \\"That the author is a lawyer first and promising novelist second is most glaring in the language used in Devil. ... This must be the first made-in-Singapore whodunnit that needs to be read with a dictionary at hand.\\" Although the protagonist Chiang's \\"view of human beings other than himself is patronising at best\\" and might leave readers with a \\"rather sour aftertaste\\", the novel's \\"light touches of romance and compassion do much to lift the storyline\\" and had \\"masterful pacing\\"..

Arthur Cohen directed the film, which was produced by Bill Randle himself. Included in the film was live footage shot at several live shows at local high schools and auditoriums in Cleveland, Ohio on and around October 20, 1955. Performers featured included Elvis Presley (several months prior to his first RCA Records recording sessions), Bill Haley and His Comets (still riding high from \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" topping the US music charts), Pat Boone, LaVern Baker, Roy Hamilton, Johnnie Ray and others. This was the first film Presley ever appeared in, and is the \\"movie short\\" referred to by Randle when he introduced Presley on his first national TV appearance on Stage Show in early 1956. It was Bill Haley's second film appearance after his group appeared in the 1954 short film, Round Up of Rhythm. A plaque commemorating one of the filmed performances is located at Brooklyn High School in Cleveland, and was installed by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The original forty-eight-minute film was supposed to be cut down to a twenty-minute \\"short\\" for national distribution, but never made it that far. As of 2005, 50 years after it was produced, the movie remains unreleased. There is some dispute over whether or not this film actually exists, although it was shown publicly, albeit only once in Cleveland, and excerpts were also aired on a Cleveland television station in 1956. According to music historian Jim Dawson, Randle, before his death, sold the rights to the film to PolyGram, although it has been reported that Universal Studios has the negatives of the film in its vaults. Marshall Lytle, who was nearing the end of his tenure as bass player for the Comets, corroborates the existence of the film in his memoir, Still Rockin' Around the Clock, and makes the unsubstantiated claim that Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager, bought the film and destroyed the existing copies. It has been reported that Elvis was invited to the concert , as he was appearing close by. He was not in the line-up but showed to meet fans. It appears that he did perform - lip syncing to his first record, stretching the show , as one act was running late ; but the camera operator(s) refused to film him , as there was a limited amount of film. (Information from elvis-collectors.com) The Alien Autopsy connection Pied Piper of Cleveland achieved notoriety in the 1990s when it was linked to the infamous \\"Alien Autopsy\\" film circulated by producer Ray Santilli. According to Santilli, he was attempting to obtain a copy of Pied Piper from a man who claimed to have been the cinematographer on the film. Instead of the rare Elvis film, Santilli claims, the cameraman offered him footage he claimed to have shot in the late 1940s of an alleged autopsy of an alien recovered from one of the UFO crash sites. The FOX network produced a popular documentary, Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction? centered on this footage, which was later debunked (by FOX) as being a hoax. This has led to some claims that Pied Piper is likewise a hoax, however documentation supporting the film's existence predates the Alien Autopsy affair by many years.

There are currently 9 service reservoirs operating in Singapore which are used to store potable water. Changi Creek Reservoir Changi Creek Reservoir is a small service reservoir located to the north of Singapore Changi Airport in Singapore. The reservoir supplements and provides backup water supply for the airport. It was formed by damming the headwaters of a small river, Changi Creek, which empties into Sungei Changi and thence into the Serangoon Harbour. Rainfall from the runways and surrounding green areas is collected in the nearby South End Reservoir. Changi Creek Reservoir is used to balance flows during incoming tides and high rainfall. Fort Canning Service Reservoir The Fort Canning Service Reservoir (Chinese: Á¶èÂ∫∑ÂÆÅÂ§áÊ∞¥Ê±†) is an underground reservoir located on top of Fort Canning Hill in Singapore. Construction of the reservoir began on 1 April 1927 on the former site of a large artillery barracks and parade ground to help supplement the large impounding reservoirs. The reservoir was constructed in two sections, the southern section was ready for water storage by 1 August 1928, and the final work completed by the middle of January 1929. Water is pumped from the large reservoirs into the service reservoirs, thus enabling water to flow down the hill into houses. Earlier service reservoirs were built on Mount Emily (1878), Pearl's Hill (1903), and Bukit Timah Hill. The size of the Fort Canning Reservoir is 30 million gallons. A spring used to exist on the west side of Fort Canning Hill and served as a source of water in the early days of Singapore. The spring was called pancur larangan or \\"forbidden spring\\", where the women of the ruler's household were said to bathe in ancient times. In the early period of the 19th century Singapore, the stream was used to provide clean drinking water for all ships stopping at the port until the demand exceeded the capacity by the 1830, and the spring then dried up as wells were dug around the hill. A cache of Javanese-style gold ornaments dating to the mid-14th century were discovered when workers were excavating for the reservoir at Fort Canning in 1928. Jalan Eunos Service Reservoir Jalan Eunos Service Reservoir is a service reservoir located along Kaki Bukit Avenue 4 in Singapore. It is found in the northern part of Kaki Bukit estate near the Paya Lebar Air Base and is therefore part of the Bedok planning area. The reservoir provides water supply to the eastern regions of Singapore and stores treated water mainly from Bedok Reservoir. It can reportedly hold 22 million gallons/ 100,000 cubic metres of water. Access to this service reservoir is restricted unlike the neighbouring Bedok Reservoir. Jalan Eunos Service Reservoir was first constructed by the British Government in 1956 at an estimated cost of $4 million to improve water pressure in the Geylang, Katong and Changi areas of Singapore, as the Woodleigh Waterworks, constructed in 1912 and still stands today, was inadequate to channel water to the growing population. The reservoir was first expanded in 1971 and was then expanded again in 1974 to increase water supply to the east of Singapore which was developing rapidly and was in need of connection to potable water. As Singapore had gained independence by then, there were also fears that Malaysia would eventually cut off water supply from its reservoirs despite agreements made beforehand. In line with the need for self reliance to provide our own water, Bedok Reservoir was then finally completed in 1985 to provide Jalan Eunos Service Reservoir with even more water especially to the residences residing in the east of Singapore. Redevelopments in the area of Kaki Bukit also saw Jalan Eunos which was once linked to the reservoir no longer anywhere near it. Kallang Service Reservoir Kallang Service Reservoir, also called Bukit Kalang Service Reservoir, is a service reservoir located within the Central Water Catchment. It is situated south of the Lower Pierce Reservoir, off Island Club Road. Though called Kallang Service Reservoir, it is located nowhere near to Kallang. It is, however, located within the former Ulu Kallang mukim, as well as within the vicinity of the Bukit Kallang geographic point. Murnane Service Reservoir Aerial photo of Murnane Service Reservoir 1958 from New Zealand Engineering Murnane Service Reservoir is a small service reservoir near the Bukit Timah Expressway and the Pan Island Expressway in Singapore. The reservoir supplements and provides backup water supply for the western regions of Singapore. The reservoir was completed in 1956 and is named after D. J. Murnane the longest serving Municipal Water Engineer in Singapore.  Pandan Reservoir  Pearl's Hill Service Reservoir The Pearl's Hill Service reservoir was first mooted in 1897 to provide additional storage capacity and increase water pressure.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepresswk18970914-1.2.93 The project is described in some detail in a 1902 newspaper report which highlighted the rapid growth in water demand from 4.1 million gallons per day (average) in May 1900 to 5.4 mgpd in 1902.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19020719-1.2.13 Built of granite and concrete at a cost of $300,000, it was 70 feet higher than the Wilkie Road reservoir which it replaced. The work was undertaken by Municipal Water Engineer Robert Peirce (engineer) and his assistant L M Bell. Upon completion there were concerns reported in the newspaper about the construction quality, stability and leakages from the reservoir. The structure of the reservoir on top of the hill rather than sunken into the hill (like Fort Canning reservoir) appears to have been the root cause of the public concern.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepresswk19050125-1.2.62 When filtered water was first imported from Gunong Pulau in Johor, beginning in 1929, it was stored in Pearl's Hill Reservoir. South End Reservoir The South End Reservoir is a small service reservoir located to the south of Singapore Changi Airport in Singapore. Rainfall from the runways and surrounding green areas is collected in the reservoir and used for fire- fighting drills and toilet flushing. The reservoir supplies 28‚Äì33% of the airport's water and saves the airport around S$390,000 per year. It is linked to the Changi Creek Reservoir to balance flows during incoming tides and high rainfall.

North American telephone area code 262 covers much of Southeastern Wisconsin, and was created on September 25, 1999, when it was split from area code 414. It covers most of the suburbs of Milwaukee, but not Milwaukee County itself. The eastern portion of Wisconsin had been served by 414 for half a century until Green Bay and the Fox River Valley split off as area code 920 in 1997. Although this was intended as a long-term solution, within a year 414 was back to the brink of exhaustion due to the continued proliferation of cell phones and pagers. When it became apparent that 414 was running out of numbers, original plans called for 262 to be an overlay for all of southeastern Wisconsin. However, overlays were a new concept at the time, and met with some resistance to the mixing of area codes in the same area and the ensuing requirement for ten-digit dialing. As a result, 262 was made a separate area code for nearly all of the old 414 territory outside Milwaukee County. A few slivers of Waukesha and Washington counties stayed in 414. Despite the Milwaukee area's continued growth, 262 is nowhere near exhaustion. Projections in early 2019 suggested the Milwaukee suburbs would not need another area code until 2044 at the earliest, but later in 2019 no exhaust date was listed, meaning the date is 30 years or more in the future.

Organ by Frobenius (2009) Tracker action is a term used in reference to pipe organs and steam calliopes to indicate a mechanical linkage between keys or pedals pressed by the organist and the valve that allows air to flow into pipe(s) of the corresponding note. This is in contrast to \\"direct electric action\\" and \\"electro-pneumatic action\\", which connect the key to the valve through an electrical link or an electrically assisted pneumatic system respectively, or \\"tubular-pneumatic action\\" which utilizes a change of pressure within lead tubing which connects the key to the valve pneumatic.  History  =Ancient history= Organs trace their history as far back as at least the 3rd century BC with an organlike device known as the hydraulis. Also known as a \\"water organ\\" or \\"Roman organ\\", the hydraulis was an instrument in which water was used as a source of power to push wind through organ pipes. (It is not to be confused with the hydraulic action of a hydraulophone, an instrument that actually uses water to produce the sound, not just as a source of power). While the control of air pressure was controlled by water pressure, hence the name, the action was a rudimentary form of modern action. It was not until the mid-14th century that the action needed to be explored and expanded as finally more pipes were added, as well as the addition of stops, and ultimately multiple cases and keyboards. =Baroque and Classical= This continued in the 17th and 18th centuries. No particularly great developments took place in the Classical Period. =Romantic= In the Romantic Period came a new style of organ building. The organ became larger and louder and pneumatically assisted action became the norm in large instruments, to offset the extreme key weight caused by high wind pressures. =Contemporary= Although tracker action was less utilized in the early 20th century, particularly in England and America, its use has enjoyed a strong renaissance in the same areas since World War II, especially in instruments modeled on historical antecedents. Today, many builders are using tracker action throughout the world, and it has been successfully employed in organs of many styles. Some active builders of tracker action organs include Taylor and Boody of Staunton, Virginia, Paul Fritts of Tacoma, Washington, Flentrop Orgelbouw B.V. of Zaandam, the Netherlands, and C. B. Fisk, Inc. of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Currently, the world's largest mechanical (tracker) action organ was built by Ronald Sharp in the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House, Sydney, Australia, and includes over 10,500 pipes. Components of the action D. A. Flentrop organ Interior of the organ at Cradley Heath Baptist Church showing the tracker action. The rollers transmit movement sideways to line up with the pipes. The action consists of many types of devices used for the playing of such said organ, as listed below: * Trackers ‚Äì trackers are the portions of the action used to make a pulling motion. Trackers can be used over long distances. They are thin strips of wood, roughly 10 mm wide and 2 mm thick. Although flexible, at rest they hold their shape. Playing a note pulls on the end nearer to the keyboard, so they are in tension while the note is playing. The term comes from the Latin verb \\"trahere\\", to draw (in the sense of \\"pull\\"); cf. modern English tractor. * Stickers ‚Äî used for a pushing motion; often paired with trackers. Their length is limited by the material, though most of the time, capping off at about 250 mm. * Levers ‚Äî levers are used to transfer from a tracker (pulling) to a sticker (pushing), or a general change of direction, or both. * Backfalls ‚Äî backfalls are used for motion over a small or short distance where trackers and stickers would be otherwise illogical to use. As a natural result, the motion also changes direction. * Squares ‚Äî a specific type of lever commonly used in organs which is at a right angle. Squares can also come in a \\"T\\" shape and form. * Rollers ‚Äî Wooden shafts that rotate. Used for parallel direction in vertical or horizontal motion. They have small levers on each end, like cranks. * Roller board ‚Äî location upon which rollers are attached (Note: rollers are often used densely in one section of the action and so are often closely associated with the roller board.) * Stops ‚Äî knobs that indirectly control the flow of air over certain ranks of pipes. They are activated with a pulling motion by hand, and deactivated (or stopped) by pushing them shut. * Trundle ‚Äî Trundles are used as a substitute for levers in the action associated with the Stops and Slider boards. The above is a list of mechanisms unique to tracker action. Steam calliopes, such as those built by Thomas J. Nichol in the early twentieth century, used a very simplified tracker mechanism. For actions used in all forms of pipe organs, see pipe organ construction. Regulation Tracker action at Cradley Heath Baptist Church showing adjusters on tracker ends which engage with the keys of the great organ. Because of construction tolerances, a means of adjustment, or regulation, of the action has to be provided. This is commonly done by having a threaded wire end on the wooden tracker rods. A circular nut varies the effective length of the tracker where it engages with other parts of the action. One objective of correct regulation is that the keys on each manual have the same rest height and distance of travel when pressed. The regulation wrongly set at one extreme can cause a note to sound when no keys are pressed. This may also be caused by the action sticking after the key is released. The other extreme is that notes do not sound, or sound feebly, when a key is pressed. Kinds of action Besides tracker action, two other kinds of action used in pipe organs are as follows: *Electric action in which electric valves are used to allow wind into the pipes *Pneumatic action in which compressed air is used to control valves that allow wind into the pipes  Advantages and disadvantages of tracker action  Currently, some organ builders use tracker action in new organs, others use electric action, and still others use either type depending on the instrument. There are builders and organists who have strong feelings regarding the advantages of one type of action over another. = Advantages = Tracker action gives the organist more precise control over the exact moment air enters the pipe. * This control affects the attack and release of a note through different touch. Before the invention of electric action, the organ was a touch-sensitive instrument. *Tracker action requires less maintenance than other types of action since there are no pneumatics to be re-leathered and no wires to break. = Disadvantages = The console or keydesk (where the organist actually plays) cannot be moved. * On some instruments, as more stops are used, the organist must apply more pressure/force to a key in order for it to play, resulting in heavy playing action when playing full organ. This can be particularly burdensome when two or more manuals are coupled. Problems of heavy action can almost always be overcome through correct use of body weight. The invention of the Barker lever was also meant to counteract this problem, by providing a pneumatic assist while retaining a completely-mechanical action. * The tracker mechanism is often noisy. In quieter passages, the clicking and clattering of the mechanism can be quite distracting.

XPostFacto - often referred to as \\"XPF\\" - runs under Mac OS 9 and allows an unmodified Mac OS X installation disc to be launched on machines which cannot boot Mac OS X unaided. This allows Mac OS X to be installed on certain Mac models which could otherwise only run System 7, Mac OS 8 or Mac OS 9, albeit sometimes with incomplete functionality. For example, it can be used to install Mac OS X v10.2 on a PowerPC 604 equipped Power Macintosh 8600 or 9600. It also allows more recent versions of Mac OS X to be installed on older G3 Macs which can only officially run earlier versions of OS X - for example, it allows Mac OS X v10.3 and Mac OS X v10.4 to run successfully on Beige G3s, 10.2 having been the last version supported by Apple. It can even facilitate otherwise-awkward installations on supported machines; for instance, it allows Mac OS X v10.4, which shipped on DVD media, to be installed onto a Blue and White G3 with only an external, non-bootable DVD drive. Likewise, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger ended support for machines that lacked built-in FireWire ports, these being the original iMac G3s and iBook G3s, but XPostFacto allows the use of 10.4 on them. The name is a pun on ex post facto, a Latin phrase meaning \\"after the fact\\", commonly used in legal matters to refer to retroactive actions applying a later state of affairs (such as legislation) to earlier situations. In this context, it refers to the installation of software which did not exist yet at the time the hardware was manufactured: it retroactively \\"applies\\" Mac OS X to pre-existing hardware. This software engineering feat by developer Ryan Rempel is made possible by the publication of the source code for Darwin, the open-source foundation of Mac OS X. XPF's functionality is achieved via three different routes. The program provides a replacement boot loader for Macs with OldWorld firmware, provides a set of kernel modules to allow the Mac OS X kernel to support various pieces of system hardware which are unsupported in the retail release, and includes a mechanism to transparently boot the kernel off a supported medium - termed a \\"helper drive\\", such as the internal hard disk - even when installing Mac OS X to or from a non-bootable volume, such as a USB optical drive or a hard disk which is unsupported by the kernel or system firmware. XPF does not support all models of Power Macintosh. Only certain PCI-based models with Open Firmware will work. It does not support NuBus-based PowerMacs. Once Mac OS X has been installed, XPF also runs under that operating system. On unsupported machines, XPF should be used instead of Apple's \\"Startup Disk\\" control panel or system preference pane to select whether the Mac should boot into Mac OS X or an older version. Although experimental versions of XPF were available before the release of Mac OS X v10.2, v10.3 and v10.4, no version was available at the time of the release of v10.5 and XPF 4 does not support Mac OS X v10.5. XPostFacto is not required to run v10.5 on unsupported Macs as long as they have a G4 processor and AGP graphics, the official requirement of an 867 MHz G4 processor only needs to be bypassed at the time of installation and once installed Leopard will run without problems or requiring XPostFacto. On Macs that have only PCI graphics though, such as the Beige G3, the version of XPostFacto intended for use with OS X 10.4 needs to be used in order to boot 10.5 successfully (provided that it has been upgraded to a G4 processor as Leopard will not run at all on G3s), although it cannot be used to actually install the operating system as it does not recognise the 10.5 DVD (another machine would have to be used for the installation and then the hard drive transferred into the unsupported machine).

He has two daughters.Tropical Rain Forest: A Political Ecology of Hegemonic myth making He has written academic papers and books on chalk grassland, on the vegetation and archaeology of Thailand (and on the rest of southeast Asia), on ecology and biogeography (e.g. his textbook 'Historical Plant Geography'), on fire ecology on lichens and mosses, on tropical rain forest and on the construction of environmental knowledge.

He hosts a website based on Bruno Latour's 'A Parliament of Things'. Stott is often on Talksport with James Whale talking about Global Warming in his regular evening show. He appeared on \\"The Great Global Warming Swindle\\" on Channel 4. In June 2008 he was a guest on Private Passions, the biographical music discussion programme on BBC Radio 3.BBC Radio 3 Published worksRoyal Siamese Maps: War and Trade in Nineteenth Century Thailand (River Books and Thames & Hudson: 2005), for H.R.H.

His Sinfonia Concertante for Clarinet in B flat is available for download, along with other compositions, and the full orchestral score from Finale Showcase. Views = Global warming = Stott regards himself as a Humeian 'mitigated sceptic' on the subject of global warming. He has not published scholarly articles in the field of climate change, although he has published books on the subject. Also, he has researched on the construction of environmental knowledge, including global warming as a Barthesian myth, for over thirty years. Stott has been critical of terms like 'climate sceptic' and 'climate-change denier'; he believes in a distinction between the science of climate change and what he asserts is the Barthesian myth of global warming, saying, :\\"... the global warming myth harks back to a lost Golden Age of climate stability, or, to employ a more modern term, climate 'sustainability'. Sadly, the idea of a sustainable climate is an oxymoron. The fact that we have rediscovered climate change at the turn of the Millennium tells us more about ourselves, and about our devices and desires, than about climate. Opponents of global warming are often snidely referred to as 'climate change deniers'; precisely the opposite is true. Those who question the myth of global warming are passionate believers in climate change - it is the global warmers who deny that climate change is the norm.\\" (see also his essay on environmental change and La Brea.) Stott is also critical of organizations like the IPCC. His attitude to climate change is best summed up in a central passage from a letter published in The Daily Telegraph (June 10, 2005): :\\"Climate change has to be broken down into three questions: 'Is climate changing and in what direction?' 'Are humans influencing climate change, and to what degree?' And: 'Are humans able to manage climate change predictably by adjusting one or two factors out of the thousands involved?' The most fundamental question is: 'Can humans manipulate climate predictably?' Or, more scientifically: 'Will cutting carbon dioxide emissions at the margin produce a linear, predictable change in climate?' The answer is 'No'. In so complex a coupled, non-linear, chaotic system as climate, not doing something at the margins is as unpredictable as doing something. This is the cautious science; the rest is dogma.\\" For his views more generally on climate change, see. = Energy policy = Stott's \\"alternative Charter for a sound energy policy\\" begins with (what) we need are strong economies that can adapt to climate change and he proposes that the Kyoto Protocol be dropped because of \\"[I]ts ‚Äòcommand-and-control‚Äô economics which have no chance of working in the face of world economic growth, especially in the developing world.\\". He believes that the Kyoto Protocol is moribund politically . Stott is concerned that the UK is failing to address its core energy needs, which must involve a mix of clean coal, gas, and probably nuclear power. Stott also encourages development of energy infrastructure in the developing world. He sees the alleviation of energy poverty, along with the need for clean water, as two of the most urgent world issues He regards most renewables as helpful (although he is critical of wind power), but only marginal to the core requirements of an advanced society. = Deforestation in the Amazon = Stott contested the research of a report in 2001 that predicted that by 2020 the forest would be 42% deforested. :\\"New research in Brazil suggests that around 87.5% of the previously mapped area of the Amazon remains largely intact and, of the 12.5% that has been deforested, one-third to one-half is fallow or in the process of regeneration,\\" he said. :\\"This lungs of the earth business is nonsense; the daftest of all theories\\" Stott teamed up with Patrick Moore in 2000 and made several appearances deposing deforestation research. :\\"One of the simple, but very important, facts is that the rainforests have only been around for between 12,000 and 16,000 years. That sounds like a very long time but, in terms of the history of the earth, it's hardly a pinprick. Before then, there were hardly any rainforests. They are very young. It is just a big mistake that people are making.\\" This is in opposition to the accepted view that e.g. the Amazon rain forest has been in existence for at least 55 million years.Morley, Robert J.

His father was Miguel Escoto Mu√±oz, a Nicaraguan diplomat. His mother was Margarita Brockmann Mel√©ndez. Through his father Miguel d‚ÄôEscoto Brockmann was descended from Nazario Escoto, acting president of Nicaragua in 1855. He was then raised in Nicaragua but was sent back to the United States to begin his high school studies in 1947. Priesthood D'Escoto felt called to serve as priest and entered the seminary of the Maryknoll Missionary Society in 1953. He was ordained a priest of the Society in 1961 before becoming engaged in politics. He earned a Master of Science degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism the following year, and was a key figure in the founding of the Maryknoll publishing house, Orbis Books, in 1970. He served as an official of the World Council of Churches. As an adherent of liberation theology, he secretly joined the Sandinistas. D'Escoto formed the Nicaraguan Foundation for Integral Community Development (FUNDECI) in January 1973 to promote a nongovernmental response to the displacement of thousands in the December 1972 Managua earthquake. He continued on as President of FUNDECI, which operates in several departments in Nicaragua until his death in 2017.\\"Excmo. Sr. Padre Miguel d‚ÄôEscoto Brockmann, M.M.

On August 5, 2014, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis had reinstated D'Escoto as a priest after he had been suspended for thirty years for taking up office in Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinista government. D'Escoto had been banned from celebrating Mass by Pope John Paul II for defying a church ban on priests holding political office. D'Escoto served as Nicaragua's foreign minister from 1979 to 1990. He welcomed the news and said his punishment had been unfair. D'Escoto, 81, had written to Pope Francis asking to be allowed to celebrate Mass before he died. Nicaraguan Revolution D'Escoto first publicly expressed support for the FSLN as one of Los Doce, in October 1977, and was appointed foreign minister after the Sandinista triumph in 1979. He served as foreign minister in Daniel Ortega's FSLN government from 1979 to 1990. During a visit to Central America, Pope John Paul II publicly admonished him for his political activity.Pope John Paul II criticizes clerical political activity, catholicnewsagency.com; accessed August 11, 2018. In 1985, the pope denounced him and two other priests, the brothers Ernesto and Fernando Cardenal. All three served in the Nicaraguan government but did not resign from office and so in violation of canon law. D'Escoto was suspended by the Holy See in 1985, together with the two other priests. The suspension stayed in place until August 2014, when Pope Francis lifted it.Pope lifts suspension of Father D'Escoto, former Sandinista official; accessed 11 August 2018. Early in the war, the Reagan administration perceived D'Escoto as a relative moderate who might break with the regime. As foreign minister, D'Escoto received the Lenin Peace Prize in 1985 and 1986 and the Thomas Merton Award in 1987.\\"The Thomas Merton Award 2006 will honor Angela Y. Davis!\\" In 1999, then Archbishop of Managua, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, criticized the priests who became involved with the Sandinistas and abandoned their priestly ministry for politics. He said the priests never denounced the injustices that took place at the time. Political activity On March 3, 1986, D'Escoto gave a speech on Nicaraguan television publicly insulting and condemning Cardinal Obando for not siding with the Sandinista regime against the Contras: \\"There is no word uttered by human mouth, no adjective that we could use to truly describe the horror produced by this brother of ours.\\" After the Sandinistas lost the 1990 Nicaraguan general election, D'Escoto led the Communal Movement but resigned that post in December 1991 after his support within the organization waned. He supported Daniel Ortega against the Sandinista Renovation Movement dissidents.Revista Env√≠o - \\"We‚Äôre Independent Leftists\\", envio.org.ni; accessed August 11, 2018.

WBGU is a student-run radio station that focuses on independent, underground, and under-represented music. History WBGU's origins begin with a public address system built to broadcast a Bowling Green basketball game with audio phoned in from New York City in December 1947.

This station, run by students and volunteers, was authorized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and was affiliated with the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System. Repeated expansion led the university in 1951 to apply to the FCC for a construction permit to build an FM broadcasting station, licensed as \\"WBGU\\" in November 1951, with 10 watts of effective radiated power on a frequency of 88.1 MHz.

It was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 1, 2005. Albert Brooks guest stars in the episode, playing the character Tab Spangler, as well as briefly reprising Jacques from \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\". \\"The Heartbroke Kid\\" is the 352nd episode in the program's history and was broadcast straight after the 351st episode, \\"Don't Fear the Roofer\\", on the Fox network in the United States. Plot Principal Skinner is looking for a company to sign a vending machine contract with Springfield Elementary, with half of the machine's profits going to the school. He looks at suggestions of a gumbo machine from the Sea Captain that seriously burned the Sea Captain's hand and a request box from Gil and rejects them, until he gets a suggestion from Lindsey Naegle. The unhealthy vending machines sponsored by hip-hop artists are installed, and most of the students use the machines (save for Lisa, who protests their extremely high sugar content and artificial additives), but Bart is seen using it the most frequently. Due to the high fat and sugar content in the snacks, and due to the high frequency of their consumption, three weeks later, Bart significantly gains weight and becomes obese, and during an in-show parody of the opening credits, he suffers a heart attack after slowly trying to make it home from school. Bart sees Dr. Hibbert, who says that malted milk balls have clogged his arteries, and that a wad of Laffy Taffy is blocking his liver. He informs the family that Bart is addicted to junk food and tells Marge to put him on a diet. However, Lisa discovers that Bart has been hiding junk food in his walls, and the family stages an intervention. When Bart tries to run away, due to his widened and obese frame, he gets stuck in a fence and is caught by two representatives of a maximum security fat camp, Serenity Ranch. Bart ends up there with Apu, Rainier Wolfcastle (who was last seen fattening up for a movie), and Kent Brockman, and the camp's leader is none other than former junk food magnate Tab Spangler (who is dealing with many anger issues). However, when Bart is there, the family is faced with an expensive bill. To pay for the camp, the family converts their house into a youth hostel, which attracts German tourists. At the fat camp, Bart cheats by sneaking food, so Tab Spangler takes him home to visit the family to show him the horrors that occur. His family is working continually to appease the students staying in their home. The Germans humiliate the family, making Homer dance for change and forcing Marge and Lisa to clean intentional messes while pointing out America's problems one by one. He suggests Bart fight his addiction, and he does, by destroying the vending machines in school. His addiction to junk food is over, and he steals the money from the vending machines, which the family uses to pay for the bill and give the Germans \\"Das Boot\\". Homer gets revenge by beating up the Germans, and tossing them out. Tab Spangler says that Bart still has three weeks left of non-refundable treatment, and Homer goes with Tab (by force from the family), where the episode ends with them driving in Tab's car arguing over the cheeseburger Homer is eating. Production Albert Brooks guest starred in the episode as Bart's fitness instructor at fat camp in his fifth appearance on the show. It was his first appearance for almost a decade, having previously voiced characters in the episodes \\"The Call of the Simpsons\\" (1990); \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\" (1990); \\"Bart's Inner Child\\" (1993) and \\"You Only Move Twice\\" (1996). In The Simpsons Movie (2007), Brooks voiced another character, Russ Cargill. Cultural references When Bart says \\"I raged against the machine and money poured out\\", he is referencing American protest band Rage Against the Machine. * The title of the episode is a reference to the 1972 film The Heartbreak Kid. * The song Homer sings to the Germans is \\"99 Luftballons\\" by Nena (in its original German). * Tab's car resembles a Volvo V70. * Homer says \\"they're melting\\" in a style reminiscent of The Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz. * Homer urges Bart to \\"Do the Bartman\\" to try to fight his heart attack. * When the Simpsons family are talking about keeping the money Bart stole and using it to get rid of the German backpackers, Marge uses the phrase \\"... give them Das Boot.\\" in reference to the 1981 movie Das Boot. * Bart hides his sweets in a hole in the wall hidden behind a poster and also stands in a shower of sweets, in reference to the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption. * Some of the snacks in the vending machine are named after Krishna, the Dalai Lama, Lolapalooza and Screaming Yellow Zonkers.

Headquarters A band plays outside of The Oklahoman's Oklahoma City headquarters The Oklahoma Publishing Company (OPUBCO) which owned The Oklahoma until 2018, was headquartered at NW 4 and Broadway in downtown Oklahoma City until 1991, when it moved to a 12-story tower at Broadway Extension and Britton Road in the northern part of the city.Steve Lackmayer, \\"101-year-old panoramic photo shows different downtown Oklahoma City\\", The Oklahoman, July 27, 2014. That building was sold to American Fidelity Assurance in 2012. Office space was then leased back to OPUBCO until plans were finalized for the company to move its headquarters. After a 23-year absence, The Oklahoman staff (and most OPUBCO employees) moved back to downtown Oklahoma City in early 2015. The new offices of The Oklahoman are located in leased office space downtown at 100 W. Main in the existing Century Center office building (connected to the Sheraton Hotel) in downtown Oklahoma City. Printing and production were halted at the existing facility on Broadway Extension and Britton Road as The Oklahoman began outsourcing printing press production to The Tulsa World in 2016. History Founded in 1889 in Oklahoma City by Sam Small, The Daily Oklahoman was taken over in 1903 by The Oklahoma Publishing Company (OPUBCO), controlled by Edward K. Gaylord, also known as E. K. Gaylord. In 1916, OPUBCO purchased the failing Oklahoma Times and operated it as an evening newspaper for the next 68 years. E. K. Gaylord died at the age of 101, having controlled the newspaper for the previous 71 years. Management of the newspaper passed to his son, Edward L. Gaylord, who managed the newspaper from 1974 to 2003. Christy Gaylord Everest, daughter of Edward L. Gaylord and granddaughter of E. K. Gaylord, was the company's chairwoman and CEO until 2011. Christy Everest was assisted by her sister Louise Gaylord Bennett until the sale of the company in 2011 to Philip Anschutz. The current CEO of OPUBCO is Gary Pierson, and OPUBCO is no longer owner or affiliated with The Oklahoman since the 2018 sale. Gary served as COO for OPUBCO under Christy Everest. In 2018 Philip Anschutz sold The Oklahoman Media Company portion of OPUBCO, which included The Oklahoman, NewsOK.com, BigWing and The Oklahoman Direct, to GateHouse Media marking the first time in the newspaper's history that it would be owned by a publicly-traded company. In 1928, E. K. Gaylord bought Oklahoma's first radio station, WKY. More than 20 years later, he signed on Oklahoma's first television station, WKY-TV (now KFOR-TV). The two stations would be the anchors of a broadcasting empire that, at its height, included six television stations and five radio stations. Nearly all of the Gaylord broadcasting interests would be sold off by 1996, though The Oklahoman held onto WKY radio until 2002. In 1939, Charles George Werner, a rookie political cartoonist at the newspaper, won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. The winning cartoon, \\"Nomination for 1938\\", depicted the Nobel Peace Prize resting on a grave marked \\"Czechoslovakia 1919‚Äì1938\\".

The film is based on the novel With Fire and Sword, the first part in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz. At the time of its filming it was the most expensive Polish film ever made. Plot The story is set in Ukrainian lands of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland during the Khmelnytsky Uprising of the mid-17th century. A Polish noble, Skrzetuski, and a Cossack otaman Bohun, both fall in love with the same woman, Helena. Their rivalry unfolds against the backdrop of a Cossack uprising led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, aimed at reclaiming control of the land from the hands of the Polish nobles. Historic events form a framework for an action and character driven plot, and fictional characters mingle with historic ones. The movie, as the book, culminates with the savage siege of Zbarazh. Cast Izabella Scorupco as Helena Kurcewicz√≥wna * Micha≈Ç ≈ªebrowski as Jan Skrzetuski * Aleksandr Domogarov as Jurko Bohun * Krzysztof Kowalewski as Jan Onufry Zag≈Çoba * Bohdan Stupka as Bohdan Khmelnytsky * Andrzej Seweryn as Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki * Zbigniew Zamachowski as Micha≈Ç Wo≈Çodyjowski * Wiktor Zborowski as Longinus Podbipiƒôta * Daniel Olbrychski as Toƒüay bey (Tuhaj Bej) * Marek Kondrat as John II Casimir * Wojciech Malajkat as Rzƒôdzian * Ewa Wi≈õniewska as Kurcewiczowa * Ruslana Pysanka as Horpyna * Gustaw Holoubek as Adam Kisiel * Andrzej Kopiczy≈Ñski as Zaƒáwilichowski * Maciej Koz≈Çowski as Maxym Kryvonis * Adam Ferency as ƒ∞sl√¢m III Giray * Gustaw Lutkiewicz as Yakiv Barabash * Dmytro Myrhorodsky as Koshovy otaman * Jerzy Bo≈Ñczak as Daniel Czapli≈Ñski * Krzysztof Gosztyla as Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski * Szymon Kobylinski as Miko≈Çaj Ostror√≥g * Andrzej Szczytko as Otaman Critical reception The movie has been criticized for introducing some factual inaccuracies not found in the source material. One of the least accurate sections of the film is Hoffman's presentation of the first battle between the Poles and the Cossacks - the Battle of Zhovti Vody. The movie suggests that the Poles were quickly routed by Cossacks and the Polish elite cavalry (husaria) showed needless bravado in the face of unfavorable weather conditions. In reality, the Poles were not only greatly outnumbered, especially after they were deserted by all the Cossacks who had switched sides and joined Bohdan Khmelnytsky, but also their commander, Stefan Potocki, was only 24 years old; despite that the battle, though eventually lost by the Poles, lasted for nearly three weeks. The original book is often deemed to be nationalistic and Ukrainophobic, especially in Ukraine. The movie on the other hand has been praised for its depiction of Ukraine and Ukrainians as \\"vivid rather than monochromatic; they are multi-dimensional, eliciting more than one feeling of, say, fascination or dislike\\".Yuri Shevchuk. With Fire and Sword\\" depicts Kozak war against Poland The Ukrainian Weekly. May 23, 1999. However, some Polish reviewers felt that the movie emphasized Cossacks' successes and positive traits while diminishing those of the Poles, in the spirit of political correctness. The director was aware of the controversies and criticism. He was quoted as saying: Sienkiewicz's book is still considered anti-Ukrainian by some Ukrainians. I understand that problem, but when I was in Kiev at a conference of Ukrainian intellectuals ... many people with whom I spoke had read the novel closely and they quoted whole passages where Sienkiewicz criticized the Polish nobles as strongly as the Cossacks. For both sides it was clear that the result of this tragic conflict was the eventual demise of both the Commonwealth and the Sich. I am well aware that the film may agitate those in Ukraine who blame everything on the Poles, and in Poland those who blame all that was bad on the Ukrainians. My film will certainly not convince any radicals. ... My film finishes with the final words of Sienkiewicz's novel: \\"Hatred poisoned the hearts of two brother nations\\". Political background Although the original novel is the first part of the Trilogy, the film was the last part of Hoffman's version of the trilogy to be made, following The Deluge, which was filmed in 1974, and Colonel Wolodyjowski, which was filmed in 1969. This might have been due to political tension between Polish People's Republic and Ukrainian SSR, as filming a novel taking up a politically loaded subject of Polish-Ukrainian relations (another stalled film project was Taras Bulba by Nikolai Gogol) was deemed undesired by the Soviet Union.THE DAY WEEKLY DIGEST #41, 2 November 1999 Box office The film turned out to be a box office success grossing PLN 105,089,363($26,366,071) against a budget of PLN 24,000,000($8,000,000).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128378/ See also The Deluge * Colonel Wolodyjowski References External links 1999 films 1990s historical films Epic films based on actual events Polish films Polish historical films Polish-language films Ukrainian-language films Turkish-language films Films based on works by Henryk Sienkiewicz Films set in the 1640s Films set in the 1650s Films set in Ukraine Films set in Poland Films directed by Jerzy Hoffman Historical epic films Polish adventure films Polish drama films 1990s adventure drama films 1999 drama films ","title":"With Fire and Sword (film)"},{"id":"1832889","text":"Push Barman to Open Old Wounds is a 2005 two-disc/triple-LP compilation released by Belle and Sebastian.

Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork gave the album a very favorable review, stating, \\"The most beloved indie pop band since The Smiths, Belle and Sebastian are also probably the best. This collection would work like their own Hatful of Hollow and Louder Than Bombs were the first half not sadly missing their early BBC Sessions, and the second forced to omit their Dear Catastrophe Waitress singles and Peel Session tracks. As it stands, the first is a testament to the power and pull of one the most singular and instantly lovable pop bands of our time; the second is a gentle suggestion that they took the correct post- mainstream fame steps after all, avoiding self-parody (see: Morrissey) and finding a way to be playful without becoming too precious (see: Lawrence in his post-Felt years). In combination, it's a perfect way into the world of Belle and Sebastian, even if the band spends the second half of the disc trying to redecorate that space.\\" Track listing  References  Belle and Sebastian compilation albums B-side compilation albums 2005 compilation albums Jeepster Records compilation albums ","title":"Push Barman to Open Old Wounds"},{"id":"1832911","text":"The Grudge is an album released by Mortiis.

Containing entries for 32,293 Japanese words in Portuguese, it was the first dictionary of Japanese to a European language. Only four copies of the original 1603 edition exist. Facsimile editions were published in Japan in 1960 by Iwanami Shoten and again in 1973 and 1975 by Bensey Publishing. The Bensey reproduction is generally considered the clearer and more legible. A 1630 translation into Spanish published in Manila, an 1869 translation into French, and a 1980 translation into Japanese (by Iwanami Shoten) also exist. There is no translation into English. Compilation The Society of Jesus (commonly known as the Jesuits), with the cooperation of Japanese people, compiled the dictionary over several years. They intended it to serve the need of missionaries for language study and research. The Portuguese priest Jo√£o Rodrigues is supposed to have been the main organizer of the project and its editor: having already published works like Arte da Lingoa de Iapam (Arte da L√≠ngua do Jap√£o in modern Portuguese; \\"Art of the Language of Japan\\" in English) and Arte breue da lingoa Iapoa (Arte breve da L√≠ngua Japonesa in modern Portuguese; \\"Brief Art of the Japanese Language\\" in English) explaining the Japanese language for missionaries, he was known among the Portuguese community as having the highest proficiency in Japanese. Structure The approximately 32,000 entries are arranged alphabetically. Each word is displayed in the Latin alphabet according to Portuguese conventions of the late sixteenth century, and explained in Portuguese. The dictionary's primary purpose was to teach missionaries spoken Japanese. As needed, the authors identify such things as regional dialect, written and spoken forms, women's and children's language, elegant and vulgar words, and Buddhist vocabulary. Many of these words had never been written in any known text before the Nippo Jisho was published. The system of romanization used by the Nippo Jisho also reflects the phonetics of 16th-century Japanese (Late Middle Japanese), which is not identical to modern Japanese. Both these points provide present-day linguists valuable insight into the Japanese language of the Sengoku period of Japanese history and how it has evolved into its modern form. The dictionary also yields information on rhyming words, individual pronunciation, meaning, usage, names of plants and animals, popular phrases, and customs of the times. Because this dictionary contains the earliest known written example of many words, Japanese language dictionaries often cite it as a primary source, such as the 14-volume Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (), known in English as \\"Shogakukan's Japanese Dictionary\\", published by Shogakukan. Examples The creators of the Nippo Jisho devised a system of transcription for the 16th century Japanese language with contemporary Portuguese Roman letters. Take the following example from Michael Cooper's review of the Jisho in the journal Monumenta Nipponica in 1976. > Regional differences between Ky≈´sh≈´ and Kyoto speech are often noted, with > preference given to the latter. \\"Qinchacu.\\" (modern kinchaku ) A purse > carried in the sash. In Ximo (Shimo, present-day Ky≈´sh≈´) it is called \\"F≈çz≈ç\\" > (modern h≈çz≈ç ÂÆùËîµ). In this example the syllable modernly romanized as ki () was transcribed 'qi', ku () as 'cu', and the syllable group ha, hi, fu, he and ho () were written 'fa', 'fi', 'fu', 'fe', and 'fo' respectively. Also the syllable o () was written 'vo', tsu () was 't√ßu', shi () was 'xi', and e () was sometimes 'ye'. To what extent these particular idiosyncrasies of spelling reflect how Japanese was actually pronounced in the 16th century is of great interest to scholars of Japanese historical linguistics. Other examples: *The name of the country, , was written nifon, nippon, and iippon. *The capital city, (present- day Kyoto), was written cami (probably pronounced \\"kami\\", lit. \\"upper\\") while Ky≈´sh≈´ was written as ximo (probably pronounced \\"shimo\\", lit. \\"lower\\"). *The term meaning \\"the first call of birds in spring\\" was spelled fat√ßu coye (modern \\"hatsu koe\\" ). *Spring warbler was spelled faru uguysu (modern \\"haru uguisu\\" ). *The word (samurai) referred to a noble, whereas the word (bushi) referred to a warrior. *The word (pronounced shintai in present-day Japanese) was listed as shindai; (batsugun) was bakkun *The word rorirori meant \\"unsettled from fright\\".

Background It was not until after the release of Cohen's second album, Songs From a Room in 1969, that the singer reluctantly agreed to tour. As recounted in Ira Nadel's 1996 biography Various Positions, Cohen's first major singing appearance at a Town Hall rally in New York City for the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy in April, 1967 had not gone well; he played a few bars of \\"Suzanne\\" and walked off, stricken with stage fright, only to be coaxed back on stage to finish the song by a sympathetic audience. Cohen finally bowed to the pressure to tour in 1970 but restricted himself to Europe, where his popularity was much higher than in the United States. Cohen would return to Europe again in 1972 and 1974. According to Anthony Reynolds book Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life, Cohen asked Bob Johnston, who had produced Songs From a Room, to assemble the band and play keyboards on the tour: \\"I ended up on the tour almost by accident,\\" Reynolds quotes Johnston. \\"He asked me to manage him; then he asked me to get his band together. Getting ready, I had said to Cohen, 'Man, I'll get you the best piano player in the world.' 'No, I want you,' Leonard insisted. I protested: 'I can't play piano. I can bang around, but I can't play, and you've got great musicians here. They're wonderful people.' 'Either you come and play, or I won't go' was Cohen's response. I thought, 'Hell, I'm not gonna miss this.' So we started off. I just played piano and guitar and organ, whatever. I couldn't play very well, but he couldn't sing very well.\\" Cohen is backed by a medium-sized, country-influenced group nicknamed The Army, which includes guitarist Ron Cornelius, guitarist/fiddler Charlie Daniels and vocalist \\"Jennifer Warren\\", who would soon become famous as Jennifer Warnes and a popular interpreter of Cohen's songs. Speaking to Mojo in November 2001, Cohen said of the female singers that supported him in concert, \\"I need them. I think my voice sounds better when I am somewhat obscured with the sounds of people who can actually sing. I have never had much competence. Personally when I listen to my songs, I'm always more comfortable when my voice is surrounded by harmonies, which to me would naturally suggest the female voice. I need to hear harmonies so that I can just find the pitch.\\" In 2009, Cohen explained further during an interview on the CBC Radio show Q: \\"I was very much influenced by women's background voices...I like those songs that had that feel. Those are the songs of the fifties. So those were the sounds I wanted to try to reproduce. Also, my own voice sounded so disagreeable to me when I listened to it that I really needed the sweetening of women's voices behind me.\\" Recording and composition Only two songs from his 1970 tour are featured, including the 13-minute \\"Please Don't Pass Me By (A Disgrace),\\" which was recorded in London, and \\"Tonight Will Be Fine,\\" which Cohen sang at the Isle of Wight. The latter was performed in front of 600,000 people under trying circumstances; Cohen was awoken at 4 am in his trailer and took the stage in his pajamas (which were hidden beneath a raincoat) to face an unruly, largely stoned audience that had just watched Jimi Hendrix perform and had been sitting in their own squalor for several days. Cohen's mystical performance, which is now considered one of the highlights of the show, calmed the crowd, with Bob Johnston marveling later on the Leonard Cohen Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 DVD, \\"I think Leonard is probably the best performer in the world. I never saw anybody that did what he did...It was a whole festival with 600,000 people there and he took it over, he captured it the last night there.\\" The album consists mostly of reinterpretations of songs (often with additional or significantly altered lyrics) from Cohen's second LP Songs From a Room taken from the 1972 European tour. At the beginning of a Paris, France performance of \\"Bird on the Wire\\", Cohen recites the first verse of a French translation of the song's lyric. \\"Nancy\\" is a version of \\"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\\", while \\"Improvisation\\" is an extended instrumental guitar trio version of the vamp from \\"You Know Who I Am\\", which is also featured. The other tracks are a cover of the folk standard \\"Passing Through\\", and \\"Minute Prologue\\". A \\"bonus\\" track, \\"Queen Victoria\\", was recorded by Cohen alone in his Tennessee hotel room in 1972. Neither Songs of Leonard Cohen nor the then-recent Songs of Love and Hate (which featured a live track, \\"Let's Sing Another Song, Boys\\", culled from the Isle of Wight performance) are represented. The 1972 European tour, from which most of the selections on Live Songs are taken, is covered extensively in the 1974 Tony Palmer documentary Bird on the Wire. The album cover features an unsmiling Cohen staring icily at the camera. The liner notes were composed by the little-known (and often institutionalized) artist and poet Daphne Richardson. Two months before the album's release, Cohen, who had been grappling with depression at the time, told Roy Hollingworth from Melody Maker, \\"I just cannot stand to remain part of the music business. I've reached a state when I'm just not writing anything.\\" In March 1975 he would explain to Harvey Kubernik of Melody Maker, \\"The previous album Live Songs represented a very confused and directionless time. The thing I like about it is that it documents this phase very clearly.\\" Reception Live Songs was released in April 1973 and was a commercial disappointment. It would be the last Cohen LP to make the U.S. charts for more than a decade. In the book Various Positions, Cohen biographer Ira Nadel deemed Live Songs \\"uneven but spontaneous. The mood was somber, the songs full of darkness, and the cover photo haunting...Reaction to the album was negative.\\" Gautam Baksi of AllMusic calls the collection \\"an integral part of the early Cohen chronicles,\\" adding, \\"The release includes several new songs...all of which skillfully combine heavy doses of erotica, love, and depression.\\" Track listingAll songs written by Leonard Cohen except \\"Passing Through\\" (by Dick Blakeslee, arranged by Cohen). *All recorded in 1972 except \\"Please Don't Pass Me By (A Disgrace)\\" and \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\" in 1970.

The Port of Boston was historically important for the growth of the City of Boston, and was originally located in what is now the downtown area of the city, called Long Wharf. Land reclamation and conversion to other uses means that the downtown area no longer handles commercial traffic, although there is still considerable ferry and leisure usage at Long Wharf. Today the principal cargo handling facilities are located in the Boston neighborhoods of Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston, and in the neighboring city of Everett. The Port of Boston has also been an entry point for many immigrants.  Administration  The Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) was created in 1956 by a special act of the Massachusetts General Court;Chapter 465 of the Acts of 1956. Section 2. however, the Authority was not enabled until 1959, due to delay in bond funding. The Authority is an independent public authority, not a state agency. The Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation and Public Works serves as an ex-officio member of the board and the remaining six members are appointed by the governor to staggered seven year terms.Massport Board and Executive Staff , Massport Its Board members must be residents of Massachusetts. The Department of Homeland Security also has a presence with United States Customs Service and United States Border Patrol agents. The port has three areas of activity: cargo, cruises and ferry service.  History  A map of Boston Harbor from 1888 Before the colonization of the Americas, the area served as a trading post for Native Americans in the region. After the establishment of the Boston settlement by John Winthrop in 1630 and the creation of a local shipbuilding industry, the port served the rapidly expanding American colonies. During that time, trade involved finished goods from England in exchange for lumber, fully constructed vessels, rum, and salted fish. With the rapid growth of the Mid-Atlantic colonies in the 1750s, the ports of New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania began to surpass Boston for inter-colony trade. In response, Bostonian merchants established trade with foreign nations besides Great Britain. This trade led to a huge increase in wealth amongst local Bay State merchants. However, the British government's imposition of regulations restricting trade to Great Britain, combined with newly enacted taxes on the colonists, caused Bostonian merchants to join the more radical elements in American society. After the Boston Tea Party, the British Parliament passed the Boston Port Act which shut down the port until the East India Company was compensated for the damaged tea These actions led to the American Revolutionary War. Though economically devastated by the Revolutionary War, the Port of Boston was again prospering with trade with various foreign ports such as Shanghai. The port's fortunes were further augmented with a navy base at Charlestown. By the mid-19th century, the shipbuilding industry reached its peak as displayed by the clipper ships developed by Donald McKay. The port also saw many land reclamation projects and the construction of new piers. With the start of the Industrial Revolution in the United States, activity in the port turned towards trade between the states. Starting in the mid-19th century, the Port of Boston was eclipsed yet again by other eastern seaboard ports such Port of New New York City as local merchant companies were bought out by New York businessmen. In 1956, control of the port was handed to the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), which began the process of modernizing the port. During the 1980s and 1990s, a project dedicated to the cleanup of Boston Harbor was overseen by the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority (MWRA). In 1966, Sea- Land introduced containerized shipping and later established one of the first container ports on Castle Island, where Conley Terminal now stands. To meet the growing demand for container shipping, Massport constructed a common-use container port on what is now Moran Terminal. However, the port faced a setback with the closure of the Charlestown Navy Yard in 1974. In the mid-1990s, the port went through another round of modernization. Container shipping operations were consolidated at Conley Terminal while Moran Terminal was dedicated to automobile shipping. A project of dredging the harbor commenced in 1997. Through the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (Big Dig), ground access to the South Boston facilities were improved with the extension of I-90 and the construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel linking South Boston with East Boston and Logan International Airport. The port has also seen a burgeoning cruise industry as well as expanding commercial and residential developments on the Boston waterfront. With the Panama Canal expansion project expected to accommodate larger ships starting in 2016, the United States Army Corps of Engineers plans to dredge harbor access routes starting in 2017, deepening them from 40 to 47 to 51 feet. This will allow visits by container ships carrying up to 10,000 TEUs, up from 7000 TEUs, and reduce the amount of freight which is expected to be shipped to the Port of New York and New Jersey and trucked to Massachusetts. The project is estimated to cost $310 million and is paid for by the federal Water Resources Reform and Development Act (about two-thirds), Massport, and an additional allocation from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Port facilities  = Ground transportation = The Port of Boston has access to I-90, I-93, I-95, and U.S. 1, including a truck-only haul road. Track 61 runs through the port, but is being used by the MBTA as a test track. There is public transit access via the MBTA Silver line SL2 route. = Massport facilities = Aerial view of part of Boston Harbor. From left to right Pleasure Bay, Conley Container Terminal, Reserved Channel, Black Falcon Cruise Terminal and Dry Dock number 3. Black Falcon Cruise Terminal Conley Terminal, photographed from Black Falcon Terminal Boston Autoport, Charlestown The public facilities, operated by the Massport, are located in the neighborhoods of Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston. These include: *Flynn Cruiseport Boston (South Boston) - This cruise terminal has been owned and operated by Massport since 1986. Running from April through November, during the 2016 cruise season the port welcomed 114 ships and over 300,000 passengers. Cruise destinations from Boston include Bermuda, Canada, Panama, San Diego, and Europe. Only vessel passengers are authorized to enter the Terminal's restricted areas; however, cruise-ship activity can be viewed from the Summer Street Bridge over the Reserved Channel and the small park at the southern end of the cruise terminal. In May 2017, the terminal was officially named in honor of former Boston mayor Raymond Flynn; it previously had been known as the Black Falcon Cruise Terminal, a former cargo building that had been remodeled in 1980, with additional remodelling and expansion in 2010 and 2015. *Conley Terminal (South Boston) - This terminal serves as the container facility for the Port of Boston. The terminal itself has been in use since World War II, when it was known as the Castle Island terminal. After Sea-Land pioneered shipping containers in the mid-1960s, Castle Island became one of the first such terminals in the country. Massport built a second container terminal (Moran Container Terminal) in nearby Charlestown in the early 1970s. After Sea-Land's lease ended in 1980, Massport built a larger terminal on the Castle Island site, later named the Paul W. Conley Container Terminal, which opened in 1984. Massport dredged the entrance channel to a depth of in the mid-1990s. Today, the facility is capable of handling Panamax and post-Panamax container ships. As of 2019, Massport is expanding the facility westward into an adjacent brownfield site once used for oil storage, and has built a new entrance road. In November 2019, it received a $20 million grand from the U.S. Department of Transportation for additional improvements. In calendar year 2018, the terminal handled over 298,000 TEU's,http://www.massport.com/conley-terminal/ up from 237,166 in 2015. As of 2019, the US Army Corp of Engineers is underwayMajor milestone is reached as power line through Boston Harbor gets charged up on a $350 million dredging project that will allow post-Panamax ships to dock without waiting for high tide.Bigger ships are presenting bigger business opportunities at Boston Harbor *Boston Autoport (Charlestown) - Now dedicated exclusively to the processing and shipping of automobiles, this site once served as the common-use Moran Container Terminal. *Boston Fish Pier (South Boston) - The oldest continuously operated fish pier in the United States, this facility houses companies dedicated to the processing and shipment of seafood. = Non-Massport facilities = The Port of Boston has facilities dedicated to bulk cargo, petroleum, and LNG shipment and storage. These are primarily located on the Mystic River, notably along the city of Everett waterfront as well as the Chelsea River area of East Boston, Chelsea, and Revere. The Chelsea River depots also contain facilities handling jet fuel for Logan International Airport. The Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant, whose egg-shaped sludge digesters are major landmarks, ships treated sludge across the harbor by barge for further processing into fertilizer. The US Coast Guard has a base in Boston,http://www.uscg.mil/baseboston/ and the naval frigate USS Constitution (\\"Old Ironsides\\") is berthed at the former Charlestown Navy Yard, now part of the Boston National Historical Park. The park is also home to the USS Cassin Young a World War II museum ship. The park's Drydock Number 1 was completed in 1833 and first used by the Constitution. It is now used to overhaul historic ships, including Constitution in 1992 and Cassin Young in 2007. Two other pre-World War II-era dry docks in the harbor are still operational (as of 2014), including Dry Dock Number 3 ‚Äî one of the largest dry docks on the U.S. East Coast ‚Äî which regularly repairs ships for the Military Sealift Command. These are located at the former South Boston Naval Annex. MBTA Boat, water taxis, and private ferries and small cruise boats also use docks at Rowes Wharf, Long Wharf, Boston Navy Yard, Logan International Airport, Hewitt's Cove in Hingham, Pemberton Point in Hull, and the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, and a number of small docks at destinations around the harbor. The Boston Harborwalk provides public access to much of the harbor's edge. = Piers and wharves = Boston's port was historically served by many more wharves and pier facilities. Although Massport maintain the more notable ones, a handful of docking facilities in the Boston Harbor are maintained by private interests or other state agencies such as DCR. Further, some wharves have been converted to residential condominiums, or hotel accommodations.

In 2015, the port handled 237,000 container TEUs, 60,000 automobiles, and 121,000 metric tons of cement. Other major forms of cargo processed at the port include petroleum, liquefied natural gas (LNG), gypsum, and salt. There were 328,305 cruise ship passengers that year. Some 114 vessel calls are scheduled for the 2016 cruise season. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, there have been concerns about the security of LNG shipments within Boston Harbor, and increased fear of terrorism. Because of the location of the LNG terminal in the Mystic River, tankers traveling to and from the facility are forced to pass directly offshore of downtown Boston. During their voyage through the harbor, they are protected by a security zone that extends in front of the vessel, behind it, and more than half a mile on either side. This zone is enforced by escort vessels provided by the Coast Guard and State Police. The Tobin Bridge is closed as the escort passes under it, and boating is forbidden within the security zone. , there have been proposals to construct an offshore LNG facility on either Outer Brewster IslandThe Park Under Attack, The Boston Harbor Islands: A History of an Urban Wilderness in the Harbor, or further afield in the wider Massachusetts Bay. An LNG carrier passes just offshore of downtown Boston, under Coast Guard and police escort. The MBTA operates commuter boats between Long Wharf and Rowes Wharf on the downtown Boston waterfront to Hingham, Hull, Quincy, and Logan Airport as well as inner harbor ferries between downtown Boston, Charlestown, and South Boston. Other fast passenger ferries operate to Provincetown and Salem. Several companies operate cruise ships on the harbor, whilst water taxis operate from various points on the downtown Boston waterfront, Logan Airport, Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston. Ferries are also provided for travel amongst the harbor islands. There are occasionally marine accidents, as with a commuter ferry Massachusetts going from Boston's Rowes Wharf to Hull in June 2006.  Port police  The Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort), which itself was constituted in 1956 maintains its own police force of fully certified and sworn law enforcement officers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. They work in conjunction with the Massachusetts State Police‚ÄîTroop F who currently provide law enforcement services for Massport. The port police officers are responsible for physical security and law enforcement at the marine terminals and various properties owned by the authority.

Consecration by a bishop of the same rite was required. In the Byzantine Rite, the antimension, blessed and signed by the bishop, serves a similar function. History An ancient altar stone at Jacobstow, Cornwall In contrast to the Jewish practice of building altars of several stones,For example, Elijah built his altar of twelve stones: \\"He took twelve stones, for the number of tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the LORD had said, 'Your name shall be Israel.' He built an altar in honor of the LORD with the stones, and made a trench around the altar large enough for two seahs of grain\\" (). the earliest Christian altars were of wood and shaped like ordinary house tables, a practice that continued until the Middle Ages. However, a preference for more durable materials led to church enactments in the West against wooden altars, but not in the East. The earliest stone altars were the tombs of martyrs, over which Mass was sometimes offered, either on a stone slab enclosing the tomb or on a structure placed above it. When the first custom-built Christian basilicas were built, the altar of the church was placed directly above the tomb of a martyr, as in the case of St. Peter's Basilica and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.Maurice Hassett, \\"History of the Christian Altar\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia 1907 (with illustrations) Early 20th-century practice in the Latin Church Before the Second Vatican Council, Latin-Rite priests could lawfully celebrate Mass only on a properly consecrated altar. This consecration was carried out by a bishop, and involved specially blessed \\"Gregorian Water\\" (water to which wine, salt, and ashes are added), anointings and ceremonies. The First class relics of at least two saints, at least one of which had to be a martyr, were inserted in a cavity in the altar which was then sealed, a practice that was meant to recall the use of martyrs' tombs as places of Eucharistic celebration during the persecutions of the Church in the first through fourth centuries. Also in the cavity were sealed documents relating to the altar's consecration. The tabletop of the altar, the \\"mensa\\", had to be of a single piece of natural stone (almost always marble). Its supports had to be attached to the mensa. If contact was later broken even only momentarily (for instance, if the top was lifted off for some reason), the altar lost its consecration. Every altar had to have a \\"title\\" or \\"titulus\\" in Latin. This could be The Holy Trinity or one of its Persons; a title or mystery of Christ's life (Christ the Good Shepherd; the Holy Cross); Mary in one of her titles (Mother of Christ; Our Lady of Good Counsel); or a canonized saint. The main altar of a church had to have the same title as the church itself, for instance, there are many \\"side altars\\" in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, but the \\"high altar\\" in the center is dedicated to St. Patrick. This reflected the idea that the altar was the key element, and the church was built to house it, as opposed to the church being built and simply supplied with an altar as part of its furniture. Obviously, these regulations would have made it impossible to celebrate Mass anywhere but inside of a Roman Catholic church. To provide for other circumstances‚Äîfor chaplains of everything from military to Boy Scout units, for priests traveling alone, for missionaries, or for large outdoor celebrations of Mass on pilgrimages‚Äîportable altars, popularly called \\"altar stones,\\" were used. These were usually blocks of marble, often about 6 inches by 9 inches and an inch thick, consecrated as described above. A priest with a field kit could simply place this stone on any available surface (a tailgate, or a stump or log) to celebrate Mass, or it could be inserted in a flat frame built into the surface of a wooden altar. Many Roman Catholic schools had a full-sized, decoratively carved wooden altar (which, being wood, could not be consecrated) in their gym or auditorium that could be taken out and prepared for Mass, with an altar stone placed in the \\"mensa\\" space. The privilege of using a portable altar was not automatically conferred on any priest. Cardinals and bishops normally had such rights under canon law, but other priests had to be given specific permission‚Äî this was, however, easily and widely obtained. Present canonical rules for the Latin Church The Code of Canon Law dedicates a short chapter of five canons to altars for Mass.Code of Canon Law, Book IV, Part III, Title I, Chapter IV It states: :It is desirable to have a fixed altar in every church, but a fixed or a movable altar in other places designated for sacred celebrations (Canon 1235 ¬ß2) On the material to be used, it decrees: :Canon 1236 ¬ß1. According to the traditional practice of the Church, the table of a fixed altar is to be of stone, and indeed of a single natural stone. Nevertheless, another worthy and solid material can also be used in the judgment of the conference of bishops. The supports or base, however, can be made of any material. :¬ß2. A movable altar can be constructed of any solid material suitable for liturgical use. With regard to relics of saints, it says: :Canon 1237 ¬ß2. The ancient tradition of placing relics of martyrs or other saints under a fixed altar is to be preserved, according to the norms given in the liturgical books. The norms in Rite of Dedication of a Church and an Altar are: :It is fitting that the tradition of the Roman liturgy should be preserved of placing relics of martyrs or other saints beneath the altar. However, the following should be noted: :a) Relics intended for deposition should be of such a size that they can be recognized as parts of human bodies. Hence excessively small relics of one or more saints must not be deposited. :b) The greatest care must be taken to determine whether relics intended for deposition are authentic. It is better for an altar to be dedicated without relics than to have relics of doubtful credibility placed beneath it. :c) A reliquary must not be placed on the altar or in the table of the altar but beneath the table of the altar, as the design of the altar may allow.Rite of Dedication of a Church and an Altar, Chapter II, 5 Rite of Dedication of a Church and an Altar also states: :It is not permissible to place the relics of saints in the base of a movable altar.Rite of Dedication of a Church and an Altar, Chapter VI, 4 See alsoAltar Stone (Stonehenge) *Antimension *Tabot *Thabilitho References External links Catholic liturgy Eucharistic objects Christian religious objects Altars ","title":"Altar stone"},{"id":"1832968","text":"Tian gao, Huangdi yuan (Chinese: , p TiƒÅn gƒÅo, hu√°ngd√¨ yu«én) is a Chinese proverb typically translated \\"Heaven is high and the emperor is far away\\". The saying is thought to have come from Zhejiang province in the Yuan Dynasty.My China Connection\\" Heaven is high and the emperor is far away\\". Connections between the Chinese Central Government in Beijing and the people has historically been weak, with much regional autonomy and little loyalty. The proverb has thus come to generally mean that central authorities have little influence over local affairs, and it is often used in reference to corruption. The saying, as it is considered in China, has multiple meanings. Often it involves something minor such as walking on the grass when no one is watching, ignoring a command because the father is far away, cutting timber when not permitted, or ignoring the one-child policy. It is also used to describe a lawless place far from the authorities.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 29 and US 50 in Fairfax east to SR 400 in Alexandria. SR 236 is a major suburban arterial highway that connects the independent cities of Fairfax and Alexandria via Annandale in Fairfax County. The state highway is known as Main Street in City of Fairfax, Little River Turnpike in Fairfax County, where the highway meets Interstate 495 (I-495), and Duke Street in Alexandria, where the road has junctions with I-395 and US 1. Route description View west along SR 236 in Fairfax SR 236 begins at an intersection with US 29 and US 50 in the western part of the city of Fairfax. US 29 heads west-southwest as Lee Highway toward Centreville and US 50 heads west-northwest as Lee Jackson Highway toward Chantilly. The two U.S. Highways run concurrently east-northeast as Lee Highway toward Arlington; that highway is also known as Fairfax Boulevard, which was the original bypass of Fairfax. SR 236 heads east-southeast as Main Street, a four-lane divided boulevard, through a commercial area toward downtown Fairfax. At historic Truro Church in the City of Fairfax Historic District, SR 236 veers north onto North Street while Main Street continues straight through the downtown area. Main Street maintains one through lane in each direction and North Street maintains two through lanes per direction. Eastbound SR 236 traffic headed for northbound SR 123 (Chain Bridge Road) and westbound SR 236 traffic aiming for southbound SR 123 must use Main Street. After three blocks, SR 236 returns to Main Street and continues east as a four-lane divided highway through the eastern part of Fairfax. SR 236 intersects Pickett Road, which heads north as SR 237 opposite Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School, before leaving the city of Fairfax and becoming Little River Turnpike. The state highway passes the Annandale campus of Northern Virginia Community College, whose access road is SR 376 (Lake Drive), before meeting I-495 (Capital Beltway) at a cloverleaf interchange. In the commercial center of Annandale, westbound SR 236 receives the western terminus of SR 244 (Columbia Pike), whose southernmost segment is one-way westbound. The other connections with SR 244 are provided via SR 617 (Backlick Road). The state highway passes through Lincolnia before entering the city of Alexandria just west of the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-395 (Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway). The interchange includes a flyover ramp from eastbound SR 236 to northbound I-395. SR 236 continues through Alexandria as six-lane Duke Street, which passes the Landmark Mall just west of its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 401 (Van Dorn Street). Direct access to the mall is provided from eastbound SR 236 via a flyover ramp. The state highway has a trumpet interchange with the access road for Ben Brenman Park just west of Holmes Run, a tributary of Cameron Run, then reduces to a four-lane undivided highway at Jordan Street. View east along SR 236 just east of I-395 in Alexandria SR 236 expands to a divided highway again at Quaker Lane and meets the northern end of Virginia State Route 241 (Telegraph Road) at a trumpet interchange; SR 241 provides access to I-95 and I-495 (Capital Beltway) and Eisenhower Avenue to the south. SR 236 passes south of the George Washington Masonic National Memorial and crosses over CSX's RF&P; Subdivision, which carries Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express service as well as freight service, and the Yellow and Blue lines of the Washington Metro. Callahan Drive, which intersects the state highway just west of the railroad crossing, provides access to Alexandria Union Station. SR 236 reduces to four lanes and enters Old Town Alexandria at Diagonal Road, which provides access to Washington Metro's King Street ‚Äì Old Town. The state highway reduces to two lanes at US 1, which follows Henry Street southbound and Patrick Street northbound. Three blocks to the east, SR 236 reaches its eastern terminus at SR 400 (Washington Street), which leads to the George Washington Memorial Parkway in both directions. Duke Street continues east as an unnumbered road seven blocks to the Robinson Terminal on the Potomac River. History The Little River Turnpike was built between 1801 and 1806, and the road was a privately owned and operated toll road during the 19th century running from Alexandria to Aldie in Loudoun County, Virginia. Toll houses were placed at five mile intervals along the road for collection of fees. The road was a paved (\\"macadamized\\") road 20 feet wide. The road remained a private road until it became a public road in 1896. Several sections of the road originated as Indian trails, and a majority of the road traversed rural areas. Many Civil War battles and skirmishes were fought at locations along or near the road. Currently, the portion of the historical turnpike between Aldie and Fairfax is part of US 50. Only the SR 236 section continues to carry the Little River Turnpike name. SR 236 appeared in its present location in July 1935 as a replacement for US 50, which for several years previously ran the entire length of the historic Little River Turnpike to Alexandria before turning northward toward Washington concurrent with US 1. Prior to that, State Route 236 ran along present US 50 east of Fairfax; the two routes were swapped at that time.

The first movement starts with a quiet theme, similar to that of the later C major Concerto No. 21, but introduced fugato. The orchestral introduction builds to an impressive tutti, but many writers, including Hutchings and Girdlestone, have considered that after the entry of the keyboard this early promise is somewhat dissipated. The keyboard part itself consists of passages that do not integrate well with the fugato treatment of the ritornellic material, and, as Hutchings comments, the result is that the \\"whole is less than the sum of the parts\\".

Browne's coal mines, located near Montevallo, Alabama, were under contract to the Confederate Navy during the Civil War. The Confederate war effort was also supplied by Browne's iron furnace located on the Little Cahaba River until it was destroyed by Union forces led by General James H. Wilson in April 1865 . Browne was born in Waltham, Massachusetts in 1804. He was the son of Phineas Browne, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, and a descendant of William Bradford, the first governor of the Plymouth Colony. Browne emigrated to Alabama in 1831 to join his cousin to work on a construction contract for the Tennessee Canal at Muscle Shoals. Browne soon sold his shares in this contract and moved on to New Orleans to work on a canal from the new American Quarter to Lake Pontchartrain. Browne was involved in subsequent business ventures including a steamship company operating between New Orleans and Mobile, general merchandise stores, corn mills, lumber, coal, and iron. Browne also invested heavily in real estate in Mobile, Alabama, along with Henry Hitchcock, Alabama's first Attorney General and later Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. In addition to his business adventures, Browne was involved in Alabama politics, serving in the Alabama Legislature in 1845, representing the Mobile district, and attended the 1860 Democratic National Convention as a delegate.

It is also popularly known as the Organ Symphony, even though it is not a true symphony for organ, but simply an orchestral symphony where two sections out of four use the pipe organ. The composer inscribed it as: Symphonie No. 3 \\"avec orgue\\" (with organ). Of composing the work Saint-Sa√´ns said \\"I gave everything to it I was able to give. What I have here accomplished, I will never achieve again.\\"Camille Saint-Sa√´ns quoted in David Dubal, The Essential Canon of Classical Music, New York, 2003, p. 337. The composer seemed to know it would be his last attempt at the symphonic form, and he wrote the work almost as a type of \\"history\\" of his own career: virtuoso piano passages, brilliant orchestral writing characteristic of the Romantic period, and the sound of a cathedral-sized pipe organ. The symphony was commissioned by the Royal Philharmonic Society in England, and the first performance was given in London on 19 May 1886, at St James's Hall, conducted by the composer. After the death of his friend Franz Liszt on 31 July 1886, Saint-Sa√´ns dedicated the work to Liszt's memory. The composer also conducted the symphony's French premiere in January 1887. Structure Although the symphony seems to follow the normal four-movement structure, and many recordings divide it in this manner, it was actually written in two movements: Saint-Sa√´ns intended to create a novel two- movement symphony. The composer did note in his own analysis of the symphony, however, that while it was cast in two movements, \\"the traditional four movement structure is maintained.\\" A typical performance of the symphony lasts about 35 minutes. One of its most outstanding and original features is Saint- Sa√´ns' ingenious use of keyboard instruments‚Äîpiano, scored for both two and four hands at various places, and the pipe organ (Saint-Sa√´ns was famous as an organist in 19th-century Paris). The symphony makes cyclic use of its thematic material, derived from fragments of plainsong, as a unifying device; each melody appears in more than one movement. Saint-Sa√´ns also employs Liszt's method of thematic transformation, so that these subjects evolve into different guises throughout the duration of the symphony. Instrumentation and score The symphony is scored for an orchestra comprising 3 flutes (1 doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, cymbals, bass drum, piano (two and four hands), organ, and strings. After its slow introduction, the first movement leads to a theme of Mendelssohnian (or Schubertian) character, followed by a second subject of a gentler cast, with various secondary themes played in major, and soon after repeated in minor forms; chromatic patterns play an important role in both movements. This material is worked out in fairly classical sonata-allegro form, and gradually fades to a quieter mood, which becomes a slightly ominous series of plucked notes in cello and bass, ending on a G pitch, followed by a slow and soft sustained A note in the organ, resolving into the new key of D major for the Poco adagio section of the movement. This evolves as a beautiful dialogue between organ and strings, recalling the earlier main theme of the movement before the recapitulation. The movement ends in a quiet morendo. The second movement opens with an energetic string melody, which gives way to a Presto version of the main theme, complete with extremely rapid scale passages in the piano. The Maestoso is introduced by a full C major chord in the organ. Piano four-hands is heard at the beginning with the strings, now playing the C major evolution of the original theme. The theme is then repeated in powerful organ chords, interspersed with brass fanfares. This well-known movement is considerably varied, including as it does polyphonic fugal writing and a brief pastoral interlude, replaced by a massive climax of the whole symphony characterised by a return to the introductory theme in the form of major scale variations. Performances The first performance was given in London on 19 May 1886, at St James's Hall, conducted by the composer. The French premiere was on 9 January 1887, conducted by the composer, at a concert of the Soci√©t√© des Concerts.BSO Program Notes The United States premiere was given on 19 February 1887, conducted by Theodore Thomas, at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York City. In May, 1915, Saint-Sa√´ns traveled to San Francisco as France's Official Representative to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. He attended a performance of the Symphony No. 3 at the 3,782 seat Festival Hall. Karl Muck conducted the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. The composer was given a standing ovation at the performance, which was also attended by composer John Philip Sousa. Saint-Sa√´ns composed another piece especially for the occasion called \\"Hail California,\\" which included Sousa's famous band. The symphony was performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the 2009 BBC Proms season as the finale to a concert celebrating the 800th anniversary of the University of Cambridge, as the composer was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university in 1893. In the 2011 season, it was performed again by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, and in 2013, it returned to the BBC Proms, this time with Paavo J√§rvi conducting the Orchestre de Paris. Recordings The symphony continues to be a frequently performed and recorded part of the standard repertoire. One of the most renowned recordings is by Charles Munch leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra, with Berj Zamkochian at the organ. Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra recorded the Symphony No. 3 several times, with Virgil Fox, E. Power Biggs, and Michael Murray as the organists. In 2006, the Ondine label recorded Olivier Latry performing the symphony at the inaugural concert of the Fred J. Cooper Memorial Organ in Verizon Hall, with Christoph Eschenbach conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. Ondine released the recording in 2007 on SACD in 5.0 surround sound. Another well-regarded recording of the work is the Mercury Records \\"Living Presence\\" recording made in 1957 with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under Paul Paray with Marcel Dupr√© on organ. It has been reissued on CD as Mercury #432719-2. BBC Radio 3 Record Review \\"Building a Library\\" recommended the Deutsche Grammophon recording with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Daniel Barenboim; uniquely, the organ used was over 3000 miles away, in Chartres Cathedral played by Gaston Litaize. Simon Preston made a recording in 1986 with James Levine conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra for Deutsche Grammophon. Source of the themes =Influences= The Dutch conductor has noticed a strong relationship to various Gregorian Alleluia chant-formulas, especially for the major form of the principal theme of the Maestoso to Sacratum hoc templum Dei. It has also been suggested that themes within the symphony could be derived from the Gregorian plainsong melody Dies Irae, the Sequence for the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass. While this may not constitute as straightforward a use of the Dies Irae theme as can be found in such works as the Totentanz of Franz Liszt, the Maestoso melody and chord progression might also be seen as a direct quote of the Ave Maria attributed to Franco-Flemish Renaissance composer Jacques Arcadelt from an 1842 arrangement by French composer Pierre-Louis Dietsch (1808-1865), which Liszt also arranged for solo piano and published in 1865 as Chanson D'Arcadelt \\"Ave Maria\\" (S.183). =Modern interpretations= The entire main theme of the Maestoso was later adapted and used in the 1977 pop-song \\"If I Had Words\\" by Scott Fitzgerald and Yvonne Keeley. The Maestoso movement is also included as the final piece of music in the soundtrack for the film Impressions de France, which plays in the France pavilion at Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort. The song and the symphony were used as the main theme in the 1995 family film Babe and its 1998 sequel Babe: Pig in the City and can be heard in the 1989 comedy How to Get Ahead in Advertising. The piece is also featured in the Blue Stars Drum and Bugle Corps 2008 show \\"Le Tour: Every Second Counts\\" in the finale. The tune of the symphony also serves as the national anthem of the micronation of the Empire of Atlantium under the name \\"Auroran Hymn\\". Although not included in the soundtrack, the Maestoso movement can be heard along with Dvo≈ô√°k's 9th Symphony in Emir Kusturica's film Underground. The Maestoso also served as the opening work on Laserium's first all-classical show (and the first to have an actual plot), Crystal Odyssey. The composer Philip Sparke created a brass band test piece based on the symphony which was then assigned to Fourth Section bands for the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain in 2010. During the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of the BBC Proms series, the organist Jonathan Scott performed, in an empty Royal Albert Hall, his own transcription of the entire symphony for solo organ.

History The system was established in 1974 by Atlanta's first black mayor, Maynard Holbrook Jackson. His aim was to ensure that citizens, particularly those who had been historically disenfranchised, would be in a position to comment on the structure of their communities, and to ensure that the citizens would not have this ability stripped of them by politicians who found an involved and engaged public inconvenient. Mayor Jackson had the NPU System placed within the City Charter, which can only be changed by the Georgia Legislature. That same section of the Charter also contains the Office of the Mayor as well as the Atlanta City Council. Structure and Operations There are 25 NPUs, lettered from A to Z, except U. Each NPU represents the citizens in a specified geographic area. Each NPU meets once a month to review applications for rezoning properties, varying existing zoning ordinances for certain properties, applications for liquor licenses, applications for festivals and parades, any changes to fees charged by the City, any changes to the City's Comprehensive Development Plan, and any amendments to the City's Zoning Ordinances. Once an NPU has voted on an item, that vote is then submitted to the relevant body which makes the ultimate determination with regard to that issue as the official view of the community on a topic. NPUs operate according to a varied set of guidelines. Each NPU is permitted to create its own bylaws and the only requirement is that once a year the bylaws are voted on and every resident and business owner is permitted to vote on those bylaws. Some NPUs permit anyone to vote while other NPUs operate in a representative governmental fashion with only elected representatives voting on the issues at hand. Given the variances of demography within the City of Atlanta, the idea that a one-size fits all system of community governance would successfully reflect each community's view is unrealistic. Therefore, NPUs are permitted to operate as the citizens see fit. Each NPU is assigned a City of Atlanta Planner who attends the monthly meetings. Planners are charged with recording official votes, responding to questions about issues of Land Use & Zoning, to present the various items that are sent by the City government for NPU review, and to assure that meetings are reasonably orderly and moderately democratic. The NPUs are staffed entirely by citizen volunteers who receive no compensation for their efforts. NPUs are not given any funding by the City for supplies or other needs. Each NPU sends a representative to the Atlanta Planning Advisory Board, which is a citywide entity that was created contemporaneously with the NPU System. The Board addresses issues of citywide concern and sends its recommendations to the City Council and/or the Mayor depending on the issue being addressed.

Actions per minute are the number of actions (such as selecting units or issuing an order) completed within a minute of gameplay in real-time strategy games, most notably in StarCraft. High APM is often associated with skill, as it can indicate that a player both knows what to do in the game and has the manual dexterity to carry it out. Software has been developed to analyze players' APM in these games.BWChart FAQ Beginners often have low APM counts, typically below 50. Professional e-athletes in South Korea usually have average APM scores around 350, but often exceed the 450 mark during intense battle sequences. Notable gamers with over 400 average APM include Lee Jae-Dong. Park Sung-Joon is noted for the record APM of 818.EVER Starleague Round of 16 Park Sung Joon vs. Jin Young-Soo However, given that the majority of APMs are repetitions of orders already given, APM is not always considered an accurate indication of skill.  Origin  The term APM originates from StarCraft, and was popularised after the development of a large number of community tools allowing observers of game matches to view player resources and \\"actions per minute\\", which was used as a metric in determining a player's skill. After the release of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, many of these metrics were built into the game's interface, including APM, which further popularised the term's usage and served to increase the competitiveness of the game.  Speed and efficiency in APM  A player's APM value is determined by the number of actions performed in a given minute. Some actions, such as repeated selection, are easier to carry out than others, and players may repeatedly perform (or \\"spam\\") these actions, making them redundant in terms of their usefulness. \\"Spamming\\" may be used as a way to warm up and maintain speed for later phases of the game, or it may be used simply to increase a player's recorded APM in order to improve the perception of their gameplay skills. Because of this, more sophisticated measures of APM may attempt to filter out redundant actions by means such as ignoring re-selection of a group of units which was already selected and ignoring the very beginning of the game (when the typical relative lack of action facilitates spamming), in order to only measure a player's \\"efficient/effective\\" APM value. However, there is currently no standardization of what constitutes an \\"effective action\\" and APM is therefore typically recorded without any filtering.  Accuracy in APM  Accuracy is another factor related to a player's APM. Accuracy is the coordination of precise mouse clicks and keystrokes. Greater accuracy will result in fewer mis-clicks and mis-strokes; thus the player's efficiency increases with greater accuracy, meaning the APM is a more accurate measurement statistic.

Since 1995, he has been a fellow of St Cross College, Oxford; he was formerly the senior tutor. Since 1997, he has been Professor of the History of the Church at the University of Oxford. Though ordained a deacon in the Church of England, he declined ordination to the priesthood because of the Church's attitude to homosexuality. In 2009 he encapsulated the evolution of his religious beliefs: \\"I was brought up in the presence of the Bible, and I remember with affection what it was like to hold a dogmatic position on the statements of Christian belief. I would now describe myself as a candid friend of Christianity.\\"A History of Christianity, 11. MacCulloch sits on the editorial board of the Journal of Ecclesiastical History. Life Diarmaid MacCulloch was born in Kent, England, to parents Nigel J. H. MacCulloch (an Anglican priest) and Jennie MacCulloch (n√©e Chappell). He attended Hillcroft Preparatory School and Stowmarket Grammar School in Suffolk. He subsequently studied history at Churchill College, Cambridge, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1972; this was promoted to a Master of Arts degree in 1976. During that period, he was also organ scholar at the college. After completing a Diploma in Archive Administration at Liverpool University in 1973, he then returned to Cambridge to complete a PhD degree in 1977 on Tudor history under the supervision of Geoffrey Elton, combining this with a position as Junior Research Fellow at Churchill College. MacCulloch joined the Gay Christian Movement in 1976, serving twice on its committee and briefly as honorary secretary. From 1978 to 1990 he tutored at Wesley College, Bristol, and taught church history in the department of theology at the University of Bristol. He interrupted his teaching to study for the Oxford Diploma in Theology (awarded 1987) at Ripon College Cuddesdon. In 1987 he was ordained a deacon in the Church of England and from 1987 to 1988 he served as a non-stipendiary minister at All Saints' Clifton with St John's in the Diocese of Bristol. However, in response to a motion put before the General Synod in 1987 by Tony Higton regarding the sexuality of clergy, he declined ordination to the priesthood and ceased to minister at Clifton. Regarding the conflict between his homosexuality and the Church of England and his own retreat from orthodoxy he said: > I was ordained Deacon. But, being a gay man, it was just impossible to > proceed further, within the conditions of the Anglican set-up, because I was > determined that I would make no bones about who I was; I was brought up to > be truthful, and truth has always mattered to me. The Church couldn't cope > and so we parted company. It was a miserable experience. MacCulloch was awarded a Doctor of Divinity (DD) degree by the University of Oxford in 2001; the DD is the highest degree awarded by the university. In 1996 his book Thomas Cranmer: A Life won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. His 2003 book Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490‚Äì1700 won the 2004 National Book Critics Circle Award, the 2004 British Academy Book Prize and the Wolfson History Prize. A History of Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years was published in September 2009 with a related 6-part television series called A History of Christianity which first aired on BBC4 in 2009 and then on BBC2 and BBC4 in 2010. The book won McGill University's Cundill Prize, a $75,000 prize, the largest such prize in Canada at the time. In 2012, he wrote and presented How God Made the English, a three-part documentary series tracing the history of English identity from the Dark Ages to the present day. In 2013 he presented a documentary on Thomas Cromwell and his place in English ecclesiastical and political history. His 2015 series Sex and the Church on BBC Two explored how Christianity has shaped western attitudes to sex, gender and sexuality throughout history. In 2018, MacCulloch published the biography Thomas Cromwell: A Life. MacCulloch sits on the European Advisory Board of Princeton University Press.Princeton University Press, European Advisory Board Honours MacCulloch was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA) in 1978, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS) in 1982, and a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 2001. In 2003, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) degree by the University of East Anglia. He was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to scholarship.

He and his twin brother were converted to the faith once their mother did so while both became ordained priests and Carmelite friars. But, unlike his brother he retreated into the desert to a hermitage after his ordination. But, he emerged once he was instructed to go to the Italian mainland to evangelize as well as to meet with Pope Honorius III to have him approve a new rule for the Carmelites. He was slain whilst preaching and was believed a saint after his death. The Carmelites venerated him as such until Pope Pius II beatified the slain priest during his pontificate circa 1459. Life Painting 1667 - Antonio de Pereda. He was born in Jerusalem in 1185 to the Jewish parents Jesse and Maria. His mother later converted to Roman Catholicism, and both he and his twin brother John were baptised when she converted. His parents died while he was in his childhood and the Patriarch Nicodemus oversaw their education until the twins turned eighteen. He and his brother John entered the Carmelites aged eighteen at the Saint Anne convent near the Golden Gate to commence their novitiate. The two could speak Greek as well as both Latin and Hebrew. In 1210, he was ordained to the priesthood in Jerusalem and he travelled in Palestine. Miraculous cures were attributed to him around this time and his \\"acta\\" stated that he sought to avoid fame and withdrew to a hermitage in the desert (in imitation of Jesus Christ) when he was becoming popular for his miracles. He remained as a hermit on Mount Carmel when he was instructed in 1218Some sources suggest God instructed him in a vision. to leave for the Italian peninsula in order to preach against the patarini as well as the Albigensians and the Bulgars. He had likewise been instructed to go to Rome to obtain from Pope Honorius III confirmation of the new and definitive rule for the order (later granted in 1226). He set off on a Genoese ship on 1 April 1219 and stopped first in Messina before heading off to Civitavecchia before he ended up in Rome to meet with the pope. The friar preached in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran while in Rome where he met both Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Dominic. It is said that he foretold that Francis would receive the stigmata while Francis foretold his premature death. From there, he was a guest of the Basilians in Palermo where he was for over a month before preaching in Agrigento for over a month before settling in Licata. He had healed seven lepers and the ailing Archbishop of Palermo Bernardo de Castanea while in Palermo. He settled on the Sicilian island though his fame as a wonderworker caused crowds to flock to him. He also had success in converting some Jews though most Jews in Palermo came to despise him for this since he himself was once Jewish. He wanted to convert a Cathar knight named Berenger (known also in sources as Berengarius). Tradition states that Berenger was living in incest and that the friar convinced the knight's companion to leave Berenger. Berenger became enraged and had him attacked in front of the church of Santi Filippo e Giacomo in Licata on 1 May 1220, and was struck with Berenger's sword five times. He died of his wounds within the week of 5 May and according to tradition asked for his assassin to be pardoned while urging the faithful not to avenge his death. He was buried at Santi Filippo e Giacomo. Sainthood His sepulcher at Licata became a site of pilgrimage. The Carmelites venerated him as a saint since at least 1456 and the cult received papal approval from Pope Pius II at some stage during the latter's pontificate. In 1486, his remains were moved from a wooden casket to a silver urn before being moved to a more precious urn on 5 May 1623. His relics were translated to a new church in Licata on 15 August 1662, and are now housed at ; the ending of a plague in the Kingdom of Naples in 1656, was attributed to his intercession. Since 4 May 1626, he has been known as the patron saint for Palermo.

It was his 4th and final student film at UC Santa Barbara. Similar to his other cartoons, he utilizes a minimalist stick-figure technique. The film was invited into Official Competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival (where Hertzfeldt was the youngest director involved), and it won the Grand Jury Award at the 1999 Slamdance Film Festival. On top of its film festival runs (and subsequent popularity online), the short has also appeared on Adult Swim and MTV in the US and on a number of international TV broadcasts around the world. Hertzfeldt has noted that the short's international popularity is likely because it has no dialogue and plays like a silent film.  Plot  A stick figure toddler (presumably named Billy) is repeatedly attacked by his red balloon. No explanation for how or why the balloon is doing so is ever given. Similar events are shown to be occurring with other children as the short progresses. The story is considered a parody of French film director Albert Lamorisse's 1956 short film Le ballon rouge.

Jensen, appearing between 1908 and 1922. The books deal with the author's theories on evolution, backdropped against a description of humanity from pre-Ice Age up to the voyage of Christopher Columbus. The work is fictional, weaving in Jensen's stylistic mythic prose with his personal views on Darwinian evolutionary theory. It was primarily for this work that Jensen received the Nobel Prize in literature in 1944.The Facts on File Companion to the World Novel: 1900 to the Present 1438108362 Michael Sollars, Arbolina Llamas Jennings - 2008 \\"In 1908 there appeared the first volume of Jensen's great epic in six volumes, The Long Journey (Den Lange Reise), in which he portrays the rise of man ... One of the leitmotifs of the novel becomes the longing of the northerner for the lost land and eternal happiness. ... In 1944 Jensen received the Nobel Prize in literature ... There are three editions of the text; first, the original six-volume Danish novels; secondly, a three- volume English edition, translated by Arthur G. Chater, published during 1923-1924; and finally, a two-volume edition published in 1938. Under the three volume English edition, books one and two fall under the title Fire and Ice, while books three and four are called The Cimbrians. The final two books were published under the title Christopher Columbus. Plot The first two books take place somewhere in the primeval forests of Europe near a huge volcano. Fire glows on its summit and sometimes burning lava pours down the slopes, destroying everything in its path. For countless ages, primitive man has worshipped the fire-god in dumb terror. But at last comes the first great moment in the history of mankind: the emergence from the herd of a man with a mind and a will, a Prometheus. Fearlessly confronting the unknown, he solves the riddle of fire and brings it down on a torch to serve man. With it he lights campfires to keep off wild beasts. But he does much more. Observing the movements of the stars he infers the notion of time, the first abstract idea won from the darkness of chaos. He also takes the first step toward civilized intercourse between individuals, discovering tenderness in sexual relations, the inaugural burgeoning of what we know as love. In the end he dies a prophet's death at the hands of the obtuse masses, but he bequeathes a rich legacy to posterity. The next two books, with a second prehistoric patriarch, begins after another measureless lapse of time. The world has changed now, the volcano is extinct, the climate cooling. There is a general migration to the south. But one man sets off in the opposite direction to grapple with hardship. He is a sort of Cain, a slayer avoided by his fellow men, whom he holds in such contempt that he does not even condescend to take their god, fire, with him to the icy lands of the North. Defying the cold, he grows hardy and strong. With a woman who has somehow found her way up there he becomes the father of the Nordic race which is so dear to Jensen, who follows its destiny. He rediscovers fire, not simply borrowing it as before but by a stroke of genius striking it out of two minerals. And thus he founds a new civilization. The theme is repeated in the third and fourth book with another genius who invents means of locomotion: wagons and boats driven by oar or sail. The men of the North, ready now to listen to the old call to the summer lands, begin the long journey proper. The later books describing the journey take us down to historical times: we see the Cimbrians marching on Rome and the Vikings' raids. But the story does not end until Columbus realizes that dream of a tropical paradise which is the leading idea of the book.

It is the largest mall in British Columbia, and the third-largest in Canada behind Alberta's West Edmonton Mall and Ontario's Square One Shopping Centre, with 27million customer visits annually.Metropolis at Metrotown, Shopping Canada. Quoted: July 3, 2015. The mall is located adjacent to Metrotown station on the SkyTrain rapid transit system. Three office buildings are part of the complex along Central Boulevard. History Metrotown Centre opened in 1986 ‚Äì attached to a new Woodward's department store, and a Sears Canada department store that had been operating there since the early 1950s ‚Äì on land that had held a Ford Canada motor factory,http://vintageairphotos.com/bo-52-357/ warehouses, other light industry, and a supermarket, and which was adjacent to the former Vancouver Interurban Rail line (now the route for the SkyTrain). The mall has been expanded and renovated several times, and has contributed to the rapid growth of the area's population. A new Bay store and an expansion wing was added in 1992. Two additional shopping centres were constructed adjacent to the original Metrotown ‚Äì Eaton Centre and Station Square. These three different malls were connected by pedestrian overpasses, as were the two office towers known as the Metrotowers. In 1998, Eaton Centre added Metropolis, a collection of stores aimed towards younger shoppers, including SilverCity which opened in 1998 and Rainforest Cafe which opened in June 1998 (but was permanently closed in October 2001). The name Metropolis came to apply to Eaton Centre once its main tenant, Eaton's department store, shut down. In 2005, a major expansion project combined Metrotown and Metropolis into a megamall, and added many new stores and Western Canada's largest food court. Following this expansion, the two malls became one entity under the name \\"Metropolis at Metrotown\\". Station Square, however, has not been included in this megamall, and as of 2013, it is being demolished to make way for a new high-rise complex, to be named after Station Square. Construction on Metrotower III, located immediately south of the other two office towers, began in the summer of 2008, was put on hold, and was completed in April 2014. This completed the Metrotower complex.http://www.metrotowerofficecomplex.com/MetrotowerIII In January 2018, Sears Canada closed as the company went out of business.https://www.burnabynow.com/business/sears-canada-to-shut-its-doors- for-good-1.23065801 Surrounding neighbourhood The Metrotown neighbourhood is home to a number of smaller shopping centres. The pedestrian overpass originally connecting Station Square to the SkyTrain station was closed in November 2016, and is awaiting demolition. Pedestrians needing to get to and from the SkyTrain station and the shopping center are now required to use the street access. The Asian-themed Crystal Mall opened near Metropolis in 2000, but has no direct connection. Old Orchard Centre is another shopping centre located nearby that is considered part of the Metrotown district. It is a strip plaza that predates the other shopping centres in the neighbourhood.Map of Burnaby Metrotown area with its mega malls and outdoors recreation facilities for shopping, entertainment and parks ( Metrotown-Metropolis- Crystal malls / Central Park)  Stores  The complex consists of over 450 shops and services; the anchors are Hudson's Bay, Walmart, Toys \\"R\\" Us, T & T Supermarket, Sport Chek, Indigo Books and Music, H&M;, Old Navy, Real Canadian Superstore, Urban Behavior, Winners/HomeSense, Zara, Cineplex Cinemas, Uniqlo and Muji.

Hamilton was born in Catlin, New York, near Seneca Lake. He graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, New York in 1850. He went on to attend Auburn Theological Seminary, from which he graduated in 1853. In 1854, Hamilton became an ordained minister of the Presbyterian church in Ovid, New York. In 1855 he was assigned the pastorage of Columbia, California, a small mining camp established during the California Gold Rush. He built the Presbyterian church that still stands there. In 1859, Hamilton came to San Jose, California, to preach at the First Presbyterian Church of San Jose. He became Superintendent of San Jose Schools, and in 1861 he travelled with William H. Brewer and Charles F. Hoffmann to the summit of a nearby mountain, as part of the initial California Geological Survey. That mountain, Mount Hamilton, is named after him. Hamilton's bust at the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton In 1864 Hamilton became pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Oakland, his sermons appearing in the Oakland Daily Tribune. He served on the Oakland Board of Education from 1866 to 1872. In 1869, Hamilton came under scrutiny for teaching the doctrine of \\"a second probation after death\\" (stating one has a second, posthumous chance of salvation). He was charged with heresy and forced to leave his pastorate and resign from his ordination in the Presbyterian church. Most of his parishioners joined him in forming the First Independent Presbyterian Church, later to become the Independent Church of Oakland. In 1879 the church joined the American Unitarian Association and became the First Unitarian Church of Oakland. While preaching on Easter Sunday, 1882, Hamilton spoke \\"We know not what matter is...\\" and then collapsed onto the ground, dead. He is buried in the Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, CA.

It is associated with Tsushima Province on Tsushima Island in modern- day Nagasaki Prefecture.\\"Tsushima Province\\" at JapaneseCastleExplorer.com; retrieved 2013-4-8. In the han system, Tsushima was a political and economic abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B. Hauser. (1987). The Bakufu in Japanese History, p. 150. In other words, the domain was defined in terms of kokudaka, not land area.Elison, George and Bardwell L. Smith (1987). Warlords, Artists, & Commoners: Japan in the Sixteenth Century, p. 18. This was different from the feudalism of the West. History Tsushima domain shipyard site ruins. Built in 1663 CE. The S≈ç clan was one of few daimy≈ç clans during the Edo period which continued to control the same fiefs it controlled previously. Although it fought against Tokugawa Ieyasu at the battle of Sekigahara, the S≈ç clan was allowed by the shogunate to continue to rule Tsushima and entrusted it to diplomatic negotiations and trade with Joseon Korea. Its services included receptions of Korean missions to Japan. The Fuch≈´ domain sold imports and bought exports in Osaka and Kyoto. It negotiated trade and diplomacy with the Nagasaki Commissioner in Nagasaki. It had an office in Busan where daily trade and diplomatic service were conducted. The Fuch≈´ domain was given the status of a 100,000 koku-class han although its real production was below 30,000 koku, on account of its important diplomatic status, and economic wealth as a result of trade with Korea. In the late 17th century, it prospered in Korean trade and with silver mines, but from the 18th century, it suffered from trade depression and depletion of silver ores. Its economic reforms and the shogunate's constant aid did not improve its finances. Increasing threats of Western imperial powers weighed heavily on the Fuch≈´ domain. In 1861, a Russian naval ship occupied a port of Tsushima. What was worse for Tsushima was a growing internal conflict between pro- and anti-shogunate retainers. In 1862, it concluded an alliance with the Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, which was one of the prominent leaders of the Sonn≈ç-j≈çi movement. But the anti-shogunate faction was purged in 1864. The loss of human resources prevented Tsushima from playing a significant role at the Meiji Restoration. The last daimy≈ç of Tsushima, S≈ç Shigemasa (Yoshiaki) became Governor of Izuhara Prefecture in 1869 and after the Abolition of the han system was given the title of Count (hakushaku) in 1884. The diplomatic service with Korea was taken over by the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The term includes all those who jump, regardless of motivation or consequences. That is, it includes people making sincere suicide attempts, those making parasuicidal gestures, people BASE jumping from a building illegally, and those attempting to escape conditions that they perceive as posing greater risk than would the fall from a jump, and it applies whether or not the fall is fatal. Survivors of falls from hazardous heights are often left with major injuries and permanent disabilities from the impact-related injuries. A frequent scenario is that the jumper will sit on an elevated highway or building-ledge as police attempt to talk them down. Observers sometimes encourage potential jumpers to jump, an effect known as \\"suicide baiting\\". Almost all falls from beyond about 10 stories are fatal, although people have survived much higher falls than this, even onto hard surfaces. For example, one suicidal jumper has survived a fall from the 39th story of a building, as has a non-suicidal person who accidentally fell from the 47th floor. Suicidal jumpers have sometimes injured or even killed people on the ground who they land on top of. Jumping makes up only 3% of suicides in the US and Europe- a much smaller percentage than is generally perceived by the public. Jumping is surprisingly infrequent because tall buildings are often condo or office buildings not accessible to the general public, and because open air areas of high buildings (i.e. rooftop restaurants or pools) often are surrounded by high walls that are built precisely to prevent suicides. Jumping makes up 20% of suicides in New York City and more than half of suicides in Hong Kong, due to the prevalence of publicly accessible skyscrapers in the cities. The term was brought to prominence in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, in which approximately 200 people at the point of impact or trapped above the point of impact in the North and South towers of the World Trade Center jumped to escape the fire and the smoke caused by the direct impact of Flights 11 and 175. Many of these jumpers were inadvertently captured on both television and amateur footage, even though television networks reporting on the tragedy attempted to avoid showing the jumpers falling to avoid traumatizing viewers even more. The highest documented suicide jump was by skydiver Charles \\"Nish\\" Bruce, who killed himself by leaping without a parachute from an airplane, at an altitude of over .

Primary authority is usually in the form of a document that establishes the law, and if no document exists, is a legal opinion of a court. The search for applicable primary authority is the most important part of the process of legal research. Examples of primary authority include the verbatim texts of: *Constitutions; *Basic laws; *Statutes (whether codified or uncodified); *Treaties and certain other international law materials; *Municipal charters and ordinances; *Court opinions;Although the texts of court opinions are primary authority, care should be taken when analyzing the texts to determine which parts are binding as holdings in the case (see Stare decisis, Precedent and Ratio decidendi), and which parts are non-binding (see Obiter dictum). *Books of authority; *Rules of court procedure; *Rules of evidence; *Rules governing the conduct of lawyers; *Administrative regulations; *Executive orders. Verbatim re-prints by private commercial law publishing companies are also considered primary authority, as long as the document purports to be and actually is a verbatim re-print of the applicable document, statute, regulation, court opinion, etc. Many lawyers, legal scholars, government agencies and others use verbatim re-prints of texts published by private publishing companies. The term 'primary authority' is used to distinguish primary authority materials from texts considered to be secondary authority. Primary Authority can also refer to the scheme, created by the British Government, for Local Authority Regulators to provide businesses with tailored advice on regulatory matters. The formal relationship where a business or organisation works together with a Regulator under the scheme is referred to as a Primary Authority Partnership. Notes ReferencesStatsky, W. (1997).

She was the older cousin and first wife of Emperor Wu of Han until her deposition in 130 BC for committing witchcraft. Early life and arranged marriage Empress Chen was the daughter of Chen Wu (Èô≥Âçà), the Marquess of Tangyi (Â†ÇÈÇë‰æØ), and Liu Piao (ÂäâÂ´ñ), the Grand Princess Guantao (È§®Èô∂Èï∑ÂÖ¨‰∏ª, the older sister of Emperor Jing of Han). She also had two brothers, Chen Xu (Èô≥È†à) and Chen Jiao (Èô≥Ëüú). There were no authentic historical records of her real name, and the well-known name \\"A'Jiao\\" came from a pseudohistoric fable titled Hanwu Stories (Êº¢Ê≠¶ÊïÖ‰∫ã), thought to be written during the Wei-Jin period. Princess Guantao initially proposed to marry her teenage daughter to Liu Rong (ÂäâÊ¶Æ), Emperor Jing's eldest son and crown prince at the time, as well as son of his favourite concubine, Lady Li (Ê†óÂß¨). However, Lady Li rudely rejected the proposal as she was upset that Princess Guantao often procured new concubines for Emperor Jing (therefore gaining his favour at the expense of Lady Li). A greatly humiliated and frustrated Princess Guantao then approached Consort Wang Zhi, another concubine favoured by Emperor Jing, and offered to marry her daughter to Consort Wang's 5-year-old son Liu Che, Emperor Jing's tenth (and arguably the favourite) son and then the Prince of Jiaodong (ËÜ†Êù±Áéã). Consort Wang, who had been watching quietly from the sidelines, saw her opportunity and welcomed the proposal immediately. This political marriage secured an alliance between them. They then plotted together to ensure that Emperor Jing became increasingly annoyed at Lady Li. Coupled with Lady Li's own foolishness, it eventually resulted in the deposition of Liu Rong, who was demoted from crown prince to the Prince of Linjiang (Ëá®Ê±üÁéã) in 150 BC and exiled out of the capital Chang'an. Lady Li died soon after, and Liu Rong was arrested two years later for illegally seizing imperial shrine lands and committed suicide in custody. However, the union between Liu Che and Chen was not initially approved by Emperor Jing, as their age difference was inappropriate (Chen was at least 8~9 years older than Liu Che). According to Hanwu Stories, during a royal gathering, Princess Guantao held the young prince in her arms and asked him whether he wanted to marry a girl. After rejecting the choice of dozens of palace maids, Princess Guantao eventually showed her daughter to Liu Che, who bragged that he would \\"build a golden house for her\\" if they were married.Êï∏Ê≠≤ÔºåÈï∑ÂÖ¨‰∏ªÂ´ñÊä±ÁΩÆËÜù‰∏äÔºåÂïèÊõ∞Ôºö\\"ÂÖíÊ¨≤ÂæóÂ©¶‰∏çÔºü\\"ËÜ†Êù±ÁéãÊõ∞Ôºö\\"Ê¨≤ÂæóÂ©¶„ÄÇ\\"Èï∑‰∏ªÊåáÂ∑¶Âè≥Èï∑Âæ°ÁôæÈ§ò‰∫∫ÔºåÁöÜÈõ≤‰∏çÁî®„ÄÇÊú´ÊåáÂÖ∂Â•≥ÂïèÊõ∞Ôºö\\"ÈòøÂ¨åÂ•Ω‰∏çÔºü\\"ÊñºÊòØ‰πÉÁ¨ëÂ∞çÊõ∞Ôºö\\"Â•ΩÔºÅËã•ÂæóÈòøÂ¨å‰ΩúÂ©¶ÔºåÁï∂‰ΩúÈáëÂ±ãË≤Ø‰πã‰πü„ÄÇ\\"Èï∑‰∏ªÂ§ßÊÇÖÔºå‰πÉËã¶Ë¶Å‰∏äÔºåÈÅÇÊàêÂ©öÁÑâ„ÄÇ (This inspired the Chinese idiom \\"Hiding Jiao in a golden house\\" , which later ironically became a term for keeping a mistress rather than a wife.) Princess Guantao then used the tale as proof that the marriage was destined to happen to convince Emperor Jing, who finally agreed to the arranged marriage. Liu Che was later created crown prince at the age of 7, and formally married Chen as the empress-designate some years later. When Emperor Jing died in early 141 BC, the 16-year-old heir apparent Liu Che ascended to the throne as Emperor Wu, and formally made his newly-wed wife Empress not long after. As Empress and loss of favour The Han Dynasty up to this point was run according to a Taoist wu wei (ÁÑ°ÁÇ∫ËÄåÊ≤ª) ideology, championing economic freedom and government decentralization. Foreign policy-wise, periodic heqin was used to maintain a de jure \\"peace\\" with the nomadic Xiongnu confederacy to the north. These policies were important in stimulating economic recovery following the post- Qin Dynasty civil war, but not without drawbacks. The non-interventionist policies resulted in loss of monetary regulation and political control by the central government, allowing the feudal vassal states to become dominant and unruly, culminating in the Rebellion of the Seven States during Emperor Jing's reign. Nepotism among the ruling classes also stagnated social mobility, as well as encouraged rampant disregard of laws by nobles, which led to the rise of local despots who bullied and oppressed other civilians. The heqin policy also failed to protect the Han borders against Xiongnu raids, with the nomadic cavalries invading as close as 300 li from the capital during Emperor Wen's reign. Prominent politicians like Jia Yi (Ë≥àË™º) and Chao Cuo (ÊôÅÈåØ) had both previously advised on the necessity to important policy reforms, but neither Emperor Wen nor Emperor Jing was willing to implement such changes. Unlike the emperors before him, the young Emperor Wu was unwilling to put up with the status quo. Less than a year after his ascension, based on advice from Confucian scholars, Emperor Wu launched an ambitious reform, known in history as the Jianyuan Reforms (Âª∫ÂÖÉÊñ∞Êîø). However, his reforms threatened the interests of existing noble classes, and was swiftly defeated by his grandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Dou, who held real political power in the Han court. His two noble supporters, Dou Ying (Á´áÂ¨∞) and Tian Fen (Áî∞Ëö°), both had their positions stripped; and his two mentors, Wang Zang (ÁéãËáß) and Zhao Wan (Ë∂ôÁ∂∞), were impeached, arrested and forced to commit suicide in prison. Emperor Wu, who was now deprived of any allies, was subjected to conspiracies to have him removed from the throne. At this point, Empress Chen had already married Emperor Wu for years but failed to achieve any pregnancies. In an attempt to remain the centre of his attention, she also prohibited him from keeping other concubines. The fact that the young and energetic Emperor Wu was still childless had been used by his political enemies as an excuse to consider deposing him (the inability to propagate the royal bloodline was a serious matter) and replace him with his distant uncle Liu An (ÂäâÂÆâ), the King of Huainan (Ê∑ÆÂçóÁéã), who was a renowned figure of Taoist ideology. Emperor Wu's political survival now relied heavily on the lobbying of his aunt/mother-in- law Princess Guantao, who served as a mediator for the Emperor's reconciliation with her mother, Grand Empress Dowager Dou. Princess Guantao wasted no opportunities to exploit this leverage, and constantly made excessive demands from her son-in-law. Emperor Wu, already unhappy with Empress Chen's infertility and poor behavior, was further enraged by her mother's greed, but had to tolerate such abuse under the advice by his mother Empress Dowager Wang to stay put and wait for his chance. He then spent the next few years pretending to be docile, hedonistic and having given up all political ambitions, but in reality was secretly recruiting supporters. While attending an annual spring ceremonial ritual at Bashang (ÁÅû‰∏ä) in 139 BC, during the second year of his reign, Emperor Wu decided to pay a casual visit to his older sister's household on the way back. His sister, Princess Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩÂÖ¨‰∏ª), who had long intended to imitate her aunt Princess Guantao and establish herself some political leverage, had prepared a collection of young women to offer for her brother's concubinage. However, her plan did not work out, as none of her candidates managed to impress Emperor Wu. Realizing her brother was disappointed and bored, she called in her in-house dancers for entertainment. This time, Emperor Wu set his eyes on a beautiful young singer called Wei Zifu (Ë°õÂ≠êÂ§´) and had immediately fallen in love with her. Following a romantic encounter with Wei Zifu, Emperor Wu immediately conferred a thousand pieces of gold to his sister as a reward, who in turn offered the new girl to him as a gift. However, after returning to Chang'an, Emperor Wu was forced to abandon Wei Zifu as an insignificant palace maid and neglected her for over a year under pressure from Empress Chen. They did not meet again until Wei Zifu attempted to leave the palace by blending into a queue of maids due to be expelled. With the old love renewed, Wei Zifu soon fell pregnant, effectively clearing Emperor Wu of any speculation of infertility. This ensured her becoming his favourite concubine. The sudden rise of a love rival enraged Empress Chen, but she could do little as Wei Zifu was now under the Emperor Wu's direct protection. Princess Guantao then tried to seek vengeance for her daughter, and after finding out that Wei Zifu had a half-brother named Wei Qing (Ë°õÈùí) serving as a horseman in Jianzhang Camp (Âª∫Á´†Ááü, Emperor Wu's Royal Guards), she sent men to kidnap and murder Wei Qing. However, Wei Qing was rescued by his friends, a group of palace guards led by Gongsun Ao (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Êïñ), who also reported the whole incident to Emperor Wu. As a sign of annoyance towards Empress Chen and her mother, Emperor Wu publicly made Wei Zifu a consort (Â§´‰∫∫, a concubine lower only to the empress), appointed Wei Qing to the Chief of Jianzhang Camp (Âª∫Á´†Áõ£), Chief of Staff (‰æç‰∏≠) and Chief Councillor (Â§™‰∏≠Â§ßÂ§´), promoted several other members of the Wei family, and rewarded everyone who contributed to Wei Qing's rescue. Consort Wei Zifu then went on to monopolize Emperor Wu's love for over a decade and bore him three daughters. Empress Chen, now having openly fallen out with Emperor Wu, was largely neglected. Frustrated and jealous, she tried in vain to regain her husband's attention by threatening suicide multiple times, which only made Emperor Wu more angry at her. Helpless and despairing, she again turned to her mother to vent her anger. Her mother then confronted and accused Princess Pingyang of sabotaging her daughter's marriage, but was simply brushed off with the statement that Empress Chen lost favour purely because of her own infertility. Baffled by the argument, Empress Chen then spent over 90 million coins seeking treatment, to no avail. However, because Emperor Wu no longer visited her palace since the Wei Qing incident, it was already impossible for her to achieve a pregnancy. Witchcraft and deposition Now having completely lost her husband's love, Empress Chen bore great jealousy and hatred towards Consort Wei. She eventually resorted to the occult as a last-ditch attempt to salvage the situation, and was approached by a witch named Chu Fu (Ê•öÊúç), who claimed she had magical tricks that could help to restore the Emperor's love, as well as curse any concubines Empress Chen disliked. Completely convinced by the witch, Empress Chen conducted rituals with Chu Fu day and night, drank potions, created nailed voodoo dolls of Consort Wei, and slept together \\"like husband and wife\\" with Chu Fu dressed in men's garment.ÁÑ∂ÁöáÂêéÂØµÈÄÅË°∞ÔºåÈ©ïÂ¶íÊªãÁîö„ÄÇÂ•≥Â∑´Ê•öÊúçÔºåËá™Ë®ÄÊúâË°ìËÉΩ‰ª§‰∏äÊÑèÂõû„ÄÇÊôùÂ§úÁ•≠Á•ÄÔºåÂêàËó•Êúç‰πã„ÄÇÂ∑´ËëóÁî∑Â≠êË°£ÂÜ†ÂπÄÂ∏∂ÔºåÁ¥†ËàáÁöáÂêéÂØ¢Â±ÖÔºåÁõ∏ÊÑõËã•Â§´Â©¶„ÄÇ Witchcraft was a capital offence according to Han laws, especially if it involved noble families. Empress Chen's association with Chu Fu was soon discovered, and Emperor Wu assigned the infamously feared prosecutor Zhang Tang (ÂºµÊπØ) to investigate. After Zhang's massive crackdown, Chu Fu was arrested and executed by decapitation, along with more than 300 other accused individuals. Emperor Wu then issued an edict officially deposing Empress Chen from the position of empress in 130 BC, and exiled her out of the capital Chang'an and placed her under house arrest at the Long Gate Palace (Èï∑ÈñÄÂÆÆ), a suburban household that Princess Guantao once offered to Emperor Wu as a gift for tolerating her private scandals, although Emperor Wu had promised her aunt that the ex- empress would be supplied with all the daily living necessities. Two years later in 128 BC, Consort Wei gave birth to Emperor Wu's first son, Liu Ju, and was created empress for her contribution to the royal bloodline. Her brother Wei Qing or maybe it was her nephew Huo Qubing that would go on to become the most esteemed military general in Han history, further consolidating her position. In 122 BC, Liu Ju was also created crown prince. With the secure establishment of Empress Wei, any chance of Empress Chen's reinstatement was all but gone. Later life The now deposed Empress Chen spent the rest of her life in the cheerless, lonely Long Gate Palace. Still refusing to give up, she hired the famous poet Sima Xiangru to compose a song later known as The Ode of Long Gate (Èï∑ÈñÄË≥¶), hoping it would draw Emperor Wu's sympathy. Although some scholars claimed that Emperor Wu was so touched by the song that he revisited and loved her again, these claims are likely to be just inaccurate fantasies. Historical records indicate that though Emperor Wu rewarded Sima Xiangru for his work, Empress Chen never had any success recapturing Emperor Wu's heart. One year after Empress Chen's deposition, her father Chen Wu died.ÊòéÂπ¥ÔºåÂ†ÇÈÇë‰æØÂçàËñ®Ôºå‰∏ªÁî∑È†àÂó£‰æØ„ÄÇ The widowed Princess Guantao, who was already having an adulterous relationship with her 18-year-old godson Dong Yan (Ëë£ÂÅÉ),‰∏ªÂØ°Â±ÖÔºåÁßÅËøëËë£ÂÅÉ„ÄÇÂçàÊ≠ªÔºå‰∏ªÂØ°Â±ÖÔºåÂπ¥‰∫îÂçÅÈ§òÁü£ÔºåËøëÂπ∏Ëë£ÂÅÉ„ÄÇÂßãÂÅÉËàáÊØç‰ª•Ë≥£Áè†ÁÇ∫‰∫ãÔºåÂÅÉÂπ¥ÂçÅ‰∏âÔºåÈö®ÊØçÂá∫ÂÖ•‰∏ªÂÆ∂„ÄÇÂ∑¶Âè≥Ë®ÄÂÖ∂Âß£Â•ΩÔºå‰∏ªÂè¨Ë¶ãÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêæÁÇ∫ÊØçÈ§ä‰πã„ÄÇ„ÄçÂõ†ÁïôÁ¨¨‰∏≠ÔºåÊïôÊõ∏Ë®àÁõ∏È¶¨Âæ°Â∞ÑÔºåÈ†óËÆÄÂÇ≥Ë®ò„ÄÇËá≥Âπ¥ÂçÅÂÖ´ËÄåÂÜ†ÔºåÂá∫ÂâáÂü∑ËΩ°ÔºåÂÖ•Ââá‰æçÂÖß„ÄÇ was focused on her young lover and no longer bothered to care about her daughter's misfortune.

They both committed suicide the same year and had their marquisates removed. With the downfall of her family, the former empress sank further into depression. A few years later, the ex-Empress Chen died alone, about 20 years after she was deposed, and was buried east of the Langguan Pavilion (ÈÉéÂÆò‰∫≠) in Baling County (Èú∏ÈôµÁ∏£), about 30 li northeast of Chang'an, outside of her ancestral cemeteries. Age difference to Emperor Wu As there are no reliable historical records of Empress Chen's birth year, it is almost impossible to accurately calculate her age difference to Emperor Wu. However, Chen Jiao was originally intended to marry Liu Rong, Emperor Wu's eldest brother. Though Liu Rong's birth year was also omitted in historical records, it was possible to estimate his age by looking at historical records. One of Emperor Wu's older brothers, Liu Fei (ÂäâÈùû, Emperor Jing's fifth son), was recorded to be 12 years older than Emperor Wu; he was about 15 years old during the Rebellion of the Seven States,Âê≥„ÄÅÊ•öÂèçÊôÇÔºåÈùûÂπ¥ÂçÅ‰∫îÔºåÊúâÊùêÊ∞£Ôºå‰∏äÊõ∏Ëá™Ë´ãÊìäÂê≥„ÄÇ while the young Liu Che was only 3. Between Liu Rong and Liu Fei, there were two brothers born to Lady Li (Liu Rong's mother) and one brother born to Liu Fei's mother, meaning Liu Rong was at least 2 years older than Liu Fei and hence at least 14 years older than Emperor Wu. At the time of Princess Guantao's proposal, Liu Rong would have been around the age of 20, meaning that Chen Jiao would have to be at least in the mid-teens (otherwise she would be too young for marriage). Considering Liu Che was only 5 years old at the time of arranged marriage, the age difference between him and his cousin fianc√©e would be at least 8‚Äì9 years.

She was the second wife of the famous Emperor Wu and his spouse of 49 years, and stayed as his empress for 38 years, the second longest in Chinese history (behind only the 42-year reign of Empress Wang, the wife of Ming dynasty's Wanli Emperor, who came over 1,600 years later). She was the mother of Emperor Wu's heir apparent Liu Ju and the great-grandmother of Liu Bingyi, as well as the older half-sister of the famed general Wei Qing, the younger aunt of Huo Qubing, and the step-aunt of Han statesman Huo Guang.  Family background and early years  Wei Zifu was born of humble means to a serf family. She was the fourth child and the youngest daughter of a lowly housemaid/servant at the household of Princess Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩÂÖ¨‰∏ª), Emperor Wu's older sister. Her father presumably died around the time of her birth, as there were little historic records of most of her family members. Her younger half-brother Wei Qing, born not long after her, was an illegitimate child from an extramarital affair by her mother with a low-level official serving the Princess's household. When Wei Zifu was still young, she was recruited as a singer at the princess' estate, where she was also trained in dancing and the Four Arts.  Encountering Emperor Wu and consortship  Emperor Wu's relationship with his newly-wed first wife, Empress Chen, started to strain not long after he ascended to the throne at age 16. Empress Chen was an older cousin who was at least 8 years his senior, and their union was arranged from the political alliance between his mother Consort Wang Zhi (ÁéãÂ§´‰∫∫) and his paternal aunt Grand Princess Guantao (È§®Èô∂Èï∑ÂÖ¨‰∏ª), when he was barely 6 years old. The marriage was consummated at some point after Emperor Wu was then created the crown prince, but soon soured after Empress Chen was unable to bear him any children after many years. This tension further deteriorated after the young Emperor Wu, whose political survival at the time relied heavily on lobbying from his aunt/mother-in-law after the defeat of his ambitious reform in 140 BC by his grandmother Grand Empress Dowager Dou, was forced to submit to the spoilt and abusive behavior of Empress Chen. After conducting an annual ceremonial ritual at Bashang (ÁÅû‰∏ä, between present-day Baqiao District and Lantian County of Xi'an, Shaanxi) in the spring of 139 BC, Emperor Wu took the opportunity to pay a casual visit to his older sister Princess Pingyang, whose household happened to be nearby. Princess Pingyang, intending to gain favour with her royal brother by imitating the deeds of their aunt Princess Guantao (who gained favor with their father Emperor Jing by routinely procuring new concubines for him), had prepared a collection of young women to offer for her brother's concubinage to establish herself political leverage (girls from lowly background like Wei Zifu were however not considered). However, the plan did not work ‚Äì all her candidates failed to impress the young emperor. Realizing her brother was disappointed and bored, the Princess called in her in-house dancers for entertainment. This time, Emperor Wu set his eyes on Wei Zifu and had immediately fallen for her beauty. Taking the opportunity of visiting the restroom, the young emperor took advantage upon and consummated with the young singer, whom the observant Princess Pingyang had ordered to follow in and serve as a handmaid. Now excited over the romantic encounter, Emperor Wu immediately conferred a thousand sycees of gold to his sister as reward, who in turn offered the new girl to him as a gift. Emperor Wu then took Wei Zifu back to Chang'an, bringing along her younger half-brother Wei Qing as well to serve as a palace stableboy. However, what Wei Zifu would later experience on was far from a lovely Cinderella story. Upon hearing the arrival of the new girl, the extremely jealous and intolerant Empress Chen threw a tantrum and made sure Emperor Wu would abandon his idea of keeping Wei Zifu as a concubine. Wei Zifu was then demoted to an insignificant palace maid and was largely neglected. More than a year later, feeling hopeless with her life inside the palaces, Wei Zifu blended into a queue of palace maids waiting to be expelled (normally those who were too aged or incompetent in palace services) in the hope of getting out. Coincidentally, Emperor Wu happened to be there inspecting the expulsion process, and love soon re-flamed when he saw the tearful girl pleading to go home. By this point, Emperor Wu had just score his first political victory with the successful intervention of Dong'ou and consolidated enough power, and thus no longer needed to appease Empress Chen and Princess Guantao. Wei Zifu was made to stay and fell pregnant very shortly later. Wei Zifu's pregnancy was exciting news for Emperor Wu, who was upset over himself being blamed for Empress Chen's infertility. His throne was previously under threat due to his political clash with conservative factions led by his grandmother during the failed 140 BC reform, and many nobles schemed of deposing him under the excuse of \\"being incapable of fathering children\\" (the inability to propagate royal bloodline was a serious matter), and making his distant uncle Liu An the successor. This pregnancy cleared Emperor Wu's name and silenced his political enemies, and ensured Wei Zifu becoming favoured over Empress Chen. Empress Chen became exceedingly jealous, but could now do little to Wei Zifu as she was under Emperor Wu's direct protection. Empress Chen's mother, Princess Guantao, then attempted to retribute by kidnapping and murder Wei Qing, who was then serving as a horseman in Jianzhang Camp (Âª∫Á´†Ááü, Emperor Wu's royal guards). However, Wei Qing was rescued from the princess' estate by his friends ‚Äì a group of palace guards led by Gongsun Ao (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Êïñ), who also reported the entire incident to Emperor Wu. In response and as a sign of annoyance towards Empress Chen and her mother, Emperor Wu publicly made Wei Zifu a consort (Â§´‰∫∫, a concubine position lower only to the Empress), and appointed Wei Qing the triple role of Chief of Jianzhang Camp (Âª∫Á´†Áõ£), Chief of Staff (‰æç‰∏≠) and Chief Councillor (Â§™‰∏≠Â§ßÂ§´), effectively making him one of Emperor Wu's closest lieutenants. Consort Wei then went on to monopolize Emperor Wu's love for over a decade, and bore him three daughters. In 130 BC, Empress Chen was found to have resorted to witchcraft to curse other concubines in attempt to restore her husband's love to her. Following a huge investigation/crackdown under the widely feared prosecutor Zhang Tang (ÂºµÊπØ), which saw the execution of more than 300 people, Empress Chen was officially deposed for this misconduct against imperial moral standards, and exiled out of Chang'an to the remote and lonely Long Gate Palace (Èï∑ÈñÄÂÆÆ), a suburban household that Princess Guantao once offered to Emperor Wu as a gift for tolerating her scandalous relationship with her godson Dong Yan (Ëë£ÂÅÉ).  As Empress  The deposition of Empress Chen had left the position open, and Emperor Wu now had no official principal spouse. In 129 BC, Wei Qing, who was already a member of Emperor Wu's \\"insider circle\\" (ÂÖßÊúù) of government officials, led an army of 10,000 cavalry and scored the first proper Han victory against Xiongnu. The following year, Consort Wei gave birth to Emperor Wu's first son, Liu Ju, and the overjoyed Emperor Wu (who was already 29 years of age when the son was born) immediately made her empress later that year. Liu Ju was later created crown prince in 122 BC. After Wei Zifu became Empress, Wei Qing, now considered part of Emperor Wu's extended family, would be entrusted to more prominent roles in the war effort against Xiongnu, and was appointed the Generalissimo (Â§ßÂ∞áËªç) of All Armed Forces after his crushing victory over Xiongnu's Worthy Prince of the Right (Âè≥Ë≥¢Áéã) in 124 BC. Empress Wei's nephew Huo Qubing was also a distinguished military tactician with a series of highly successful campaigns over the control of the Hexi Corridor. By 123 BC, the Wei family had five marquesses and achieved top family honour, a remarkable feat for a clan from serf background. Despite the fact that the rise of the Wei family largely owed credit to the military talent of Wei Qing and Huo Qubing, Wei Zifu was often seen as the backbone of the family. A contemporary folk song sang: Because the great achievements of this Wei family, many later Han emperors considered marrying concubines with the surname Wei as a way of attaining good fortune. During her tenure, Wei Zifu was recorded as a modest, careful and low-key empress, who tried her best to keep her clan members in line and out of trouble. The legendary historian Sima Qian, despite often displaying a sceptical and condescending attitude towards Emperor Wu's extended families, described Empress Wei as \\"fine in virtues\\" (ÂòâÂ§´Âæ∑Ëã•ÊñØ). As the years went by, Emperor Wu's sexual attraction to Empress Wei faded and he began to favour other concubines, including Consort Wang (ÁéãÂ§´‰∫∫), Consort Li (ÊùéÂ§´‰∫∫, the sister of Li Guangli and Li Yannian) and Lady Zhao (Ë∂ôÂ©ïÂ¶§, mother of Liu Fuling). However, he continued to respect Empress Wei's judgment and entrusted her to govern palace affairs when he was absent from the capital, and assigned her son Crown Prince Liu Ju as the regent for governmental affairs.  The Crown Prince revolt and death  In his advanced age, Emperor Wu became paranoid and suspicious over the possible use of witchcraft against him. A series of witchcraft persecutions would begin, and large numbers of people, many of whom were high officials and their families, were accused of witchcraft and executed, usually with their clans. Soon, these witchcraft persecutions would become intertwined in the succession struggles and erupt into a major catastrophe. In 94 BC, Emperor Wu's youngest son Liu Fuling was born to Lady Zhao, and Emperor Wu was ecstatic in having a child at the advanced age of 62. Lady Zhao herself was introduced to Emperor Wu by some warlock, and was also known as \\"Consort Fist\\" (Êã≥Â§´‰∫∫) or \\"Consort Hook\\" (Èâ§ÂºãÂ§´‰∫∫) due to legend that she was born with a contractured clenched fist, which somehow magically opened up when Emperor Wu massaged it, revealing a jade hook in her palm. Because her pregnancy with Liu Fuling purportedly lasted 14 months long ‚Äì the same as the mythical Emperor Yao ‚Äî Emperor Wu decided to name her household \\"Gate of Yao's Mother\\" (Â†ØÊØçÈñÄ). This led to speculation that Emperor Wu wanted to get rid of the 38-year-old Liu Ju and replace him with the 3-year-old Liu Fuling as crown prince instead. While there was no evidence that Emperor Wu actually intended to do such a thing, over the next year conspiracies began against Crown Prince Liu Ju and Empress Wei . One of the conspirators was Jiang Chong (Ê±üÂÖÖ), a high-ranking legal official known for his ruthlessness and opportunism. Jiang once had a run-in with Liu Ju after arresting one of the crown prince's assistants for improper use of an imperial road, and feared that Liu Ju would seek payback after ascending to the throne. Another conspirator was Emperor Wu's chief eunuch Su Wen (ËòáÊñá), who was in charge of managing Emperor Wu and Lady Zhao's living arrangements, and had previously tried to frame the Crown Prince by falsely accusing him of committing adultery with Emperor Wu's palace maids. The first trial began in early 91 BC involving Prime Minister Gongsun Ao (Empress Wei's brother-in-law) and his son, leading to their unexplained suicide in jail and the execution of their clan. Liu Ju's sisters Princess Zhuyi and Princess Yangshi as well as cousin Wei Kang (Ë°õ‰ºâ, Wei Qing's eldest son) were also accused of involvement in witchcraft and executed, effectively removing almost all of his political allies in the Han court. With the sanctioned witch-hunts underway, Jiang Chong and Su Wen decided to strike while the iron was hot and move against Liu Ju, once again with the accusation of witchcraft. Because the physically deteriorating Emperor Wu was then staying at his summer palace in Ganquan (ÁîòÊ≥â, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), he relied heavily on Jiang and Su for day-to-day information. Jiang, with the approval from Emperor Wu, searched through various palaces, planted voodoo dolls and pieces of cloth with mysterious writings in the house of the \\"perpetrators\\", then condemned the victims on the spot. Eventually he reached the palaces of Liu Ju and Empress Wei, engaged in so much digging that there were barely any space to lay a bed. He then announced that he found overwhelming evidence of crime particularly at the Crown Prince's household. Liu Ju was shocked by this and forced to consult his close advisers. His teacher Shi De (Áü≥Âæ∑), invoking the infamous story of Zhao Gao's scheme to murder Ying Fusu and raising the possibility that Emperor Wu might already be deceased, suggested to Liu Ju to start an uprising to get rid of the villains. Liu Ju initially hesitated and wanted to speedily proceed to Ganquan Palace and explain himself to his father, but when he found out that Jiang Chong's messengers were already on their way to report the false accusations, he decided to accept Shi's suggestion. He sent an individual to impersonate a messenger from Emperor Wu, and arrested Jiang and his co- conspirators ‚Äì except for Su Wen, who escaped. He then denounced and personally executed Jiang, and reported his actions to his mother. Empress Wei, faced with the dilemma between her husband and son, chose to support her son and authorized Liu Ju to rally her palace guards and recruit civilian militias in preparation to defend himself against retaliation by the conspirators. At the same time, Su Wen ran to Ganquan Palace and told Emperor Wu that the Crown Prince was committing treason. Emperor Wu, not believing it and correctly (at this point) concluding that Liu Ju were merely angry at Jiang Chong, send a messenger back to Chang'an to summon his son for an explanation. This messenger, a low-ranking eunuch, did not dare to proceed to the capital city, but instead returned and falsely reported to Emperor Wu that Liu Ju was going to kill him. By now enraged and really believing his son was going to overthrow him, Emperor Wu ordered his nephew, Prime Minister Liu Qumao (ÂäâÂ±àÁäõ), to lead the regular Han army and put down the rebellion. The two forces then battled in the streets of Chang'an for five days, but Liu Qumao's forces prevailed after it became clear that Prince Ju did not have his father's authorization. Liu Ju was forced to flee the capital with two of his sons, and the rest of his family were killed, except a months-old grandson, Liu Bingyi, who was thrown into prison. Shortly after Liu Ju's escape, Emperor Wu sent two officials to Empress Wei's palace to seize her seal (i.e. suspending her rights in preparation to depose her). Wei Zifu committed suicide in response, and was buried with a small coffin in Tongbai (Ê°êÊüè) on the east side of an avenue outside Fu'ang Gate (Ë¶ÜÁõéÈñÄ, the eastmost south gate of Chang'an). Most of her clan members were wiped out in the turmoil. Crown Prince Liu Ju was later tracked down and cornered in Hu County (ÊπñÁ∏£) by local officials eager for rewards, and committed suicide when it became obvious he could not escape. His two sons were also killed. Posthumous rehabilitation Not long afterwards, Emperor Wu began to realize that the witchcraft cases during 91 BC were often false accusations. In 89 BC, when Tian Qianqiu (Áî∞ÂçÉÁßã), then the superintendent of Emperor Gao's temple, filed a report claiming that \\"a white-haired old man\\" told him in a dream that for the offense of armed uprising, Liu Ju would at most be caned, not killed, as a punishment, Emperor Wu had a revelation about what really happened. Furious over the realization that the conspirators exploited his trust and plotted his son's death, he had Su Wen burned alive, Jiang Chong's immediate and extended family executed, and killed every official promoted for tracking down the Crown Prince. He also promoted Tian Qianqiu to prime minister, and made major policy change rectifying the ideals supported by his dead son. To express his regret over causing his son's death, Emperor Wu also built the Palace of Son-Grieving (ÊÄùÂ≠êÂÆÆ) and Platform of Longing for Return (Ê≠∏‰æÜÊúõÊÄùÂè∞), officially rehabilitating Liu Ju's name. 18 years after her death, her great-grandson Liu Bingyi ascended to the throne in 74 BC as Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan then had his great-grandmother's name officially cleared and rebuilt her tomb to a larger mausoleum cared by 1000 men, and gave her the posthumous title Wei Si Hou (Ë°õÊÄùÂêé, literally meaning \\"Wei the Thoughtful Empress\\"). Her new tomb, due to its remote location and relative humbleness, escaped the looting by tomb raiders later.

Steamboat travel in blue; dotted lines are alternate routes or routes to other goldfields The Cariboo Road (also called the Cariboo Wagon Road, the Great North Road or the Queen's Highway) was a project initiated in 1860 by the Governor of the Colony of British Columbia, James Douglas. It involved a feat of engineering stretching from Fort Yale to Barkerville in the Canadian province of British Columbia through extremely hazardous canyon territory in the interior of British Columbia. Between the 1860s and the 1880s the Cariboo Road existed in three versions as a surveyed and constructed wagon-road route. The first Cariboo Wagon Road surveyed in 1861 and built in 1862 followed the original Hudson's Bay Company's Harrison Trail (Port Douglas) route from Lillooet to Clinton, 70 Mile House, 100 Mile House, Lac La Hache, 150 Mile House to the contract end around Soda Creek and Alexandria at the doorstep of the Cariboo Gold Fields. The second Cariboo Wagon Road (or Yale Cariboo Road) operated during the period of the fast stage-coaches and freight-wagon companies headquartered in Yale: 1865 to 1885. From the water landing at Yale, the road ran north via the spectacular Fraser Canyon route over Hell's Gate and Jackass Mountain, connecting to the earlier Cariboo Road at Clinton. The third Cariboo Road was the revised route following the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885. The railway station at Ashcroft became the southern end of the wagon road. Much of the Fraser Canyon wagon road was destroyed by the railway construction as well as by washouts and by the Great Flood of 1894 (interest in rebuilding this portion of the road would not occur until the construction plans for the Fraser Canyon Highway for automobiles in the 1920s).W.S. Bouvette, The True Story of the Cariboo Wagon Road. A portion of the Cariboo Road just above Yale, circa 1867‚Äì1868 The road was a reaction to the high concentration of gold in the Cariboo region and the dangerous \\"mule trail\\", which was a rough- hewn cliff-side trail - wide enough only for one mule - that ran along the approximate route of the Cariboo Road. In order to lower supply-costs to the settlers in the Cariboo region, Douglas ordered the construction of a more viable and safe form of transportation to the gold-mining settlements. The colonial government employed localsad seeking hundred of men to work on building the road from the British Colonist of 1862 http://ruralbc.blogspot.ca/2012/04/150-years-processing-of-tendering-to.html as well as a detachment of the Royal Engineers (\\"sappers\\") who undertook amazing engineering feats, including the construction of toll bridges including the (original) Alexandra Suspension Bridge of 1863. Cariboo Road along the Thompson River at Saddle Rock, 1867 Building the road cost nearly one and a quarter million dollars, and left a standing debt of ¬£112,780 after its completion, one of many infrastructure costs in servicing the Gold Colony that forced its amalgamation first with Vancouver Island (1866), and then with Canada (1871 confederation). The Cariboo Road saw the transportation of over six and a half million dollars' worth of gold. Originally Douglas wanted to stretch the road across the continental divide into Rupert's Land (modern day Alberta) but this plan was abandoned when Douglas retired in 1864. The \\"Old\\" Cariboo Road The Cariboo Road at Soda Creek. The style of truss-bridge shown is typical of Royal Engineer design. The name Cariboo Road or Cariboo Trail is also informally applied to a toll road built by contractor Gustavus Blin- Wright in 1861‚Äì1862 from Lillooet to Williams Lake, Van Winkle and on to Williams Creek (Richfield, Barkerville). This route was known also as the Old Cariboo Road, when the Lakes Route from Port Douglas to Lillooet had not yet been superseded by the Fraser Canyon route of the Cariboo Wagon Road proper. The mile-house names (e.g. 100 Mile House), in the Cariboo are derived from measurements taken from the Mile '0' of this road, which is in the bend in the Main Street of Lillooet and commemorated there by a cairn erected in the 1958 Centennial Year. It was along this route that an attempt was made to use Bactrian camels purchased from the U.S. Camel Corps for freight (1862), and also a tractor-style Thomson Road Steamer known as a \\"road train\\", one of the earliest motorized vehicles. Most foot traffic from Lillooet to the Cariboo however, went by the \\"River Trail\\", far below the wagon road, which departed the Fraser Canyon at Pavilion for the steep climb over Pavilion Mountain to Clinton, where it merged with the newer Cariboo Road via Yale and Ashcroft (once the latter route was completed, that is). The River Trail continued along the Fraser Canyon as far as Big Bar and various routes spread towards Quesnel and Barkerville from there.

She has broken twenty world records during her career. Life Trason was a top runner in high school, but a knee injury kept her from competing in college. Trason's ultra career began when she entered the 1985 American River 50 Miler at age 24 and both won and set a course record. She returned 8 years later and dropped her time by an hour to establish the 6:09 female course record that still stands. Trason did not finish her first two times trying to run the Western States 100; in 1987 she dropped out due to knee problems and in 1988, near the finish line, from dehydration. This is the unabridged version of an interview published in the January 2009 edition of Trail Runner magazine. She finished and won it in 1989. She has won Western States 14 times in all, most recently in 2003. She held the women's division course record for 18 years (17:37:51, set in 1994) until it was broken by Ellie Greenwood in 2012. Trason appears in Christopher McDougall's accounts of the Leadville Trail 100 in the 1990s in his 2009 book, Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen. Her time of 18:06:24 in the 1994 Leadville is the women's course record.

Historically it was believed to be part of the vitamin B complex and was called vitamin B13, but it is now known that it is not a vitamin. The compound is manufactured in the body via a mitochondrial enzyme, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase or a cytoplasmic enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis pathway. It is sometimes used as a mineral carrier in some dietary supplements (to increase their bioavailability), most commonly for lithium orotate.  Synthesis  Dihydroorotate is synthesized to orotic acid by the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, where it later combines with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form orotidine-5'-monophosphate (OMP). A distinguishing characteristic of pyrimidine synthesis is that the pyrimidine ring is fully synthesized before being attached to the ribose sugar, whereas purine synthesis happens by building the base directly on the sugar.  Pathology  A buildup of orotic acid can lead to orotic aciduria and acidemia. It may be a symptom of an increased ammonia load due to a metabolic disorder, such as a urea cycle disorder. In ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, an X-linked inherited and the most common urea cycle disorder, excess carbamoyl phosphate is converted into orotic acid. This leads to an increased serum ammonia level, increased serum and urinary orotic acid levels and a decreased serum blood urea nitrogen level. This also leads to an increased urinary orotic acid excretion, because the orotic acid is not being properly utilized and must be eliminated. The hyperammonemia depletes alpha-ketoglutarate leading to the inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) decreasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Orotic aciduria is a cause of megaloblastic anaemia.

Starhyke began production in October 2004 and starred Claudia Christian of Babylon 5 and Jeremy Bulloch from Star Wars. In 2007, the producers aimed to complete post- production, and in March 2008 it was announced that this process was now finished. However, a later post on the official site stated that post- production would be completed at the end of September 2008, and that there was a private screening of all six episodes in Bristol, UK in November 2008. Only six episodes were originally made. An announcement on the official site reported that the producers were \\"getting nearer to finalising a deal and being able to announce which channel has been lucky enough to add Starhyke to their spring schedule\\". Producer, Jonathan Brown, said in March 2008 that Virgin 1 and Sky One had refused the series while Five Life, Bravo and Paramount Comedy were considering buying it. As reported on the official website props, costumes and posters from Starhyke were featured in episode 39 of the BBC drama Casualty, broadcast on 24 May 2008. The series got its world premiere at a press, cast and crew screening at the Showcase Cinema De Lux in Cabot Circus, Bristol on 8 November 2008. The series was released on DVD on 30 November 2009. The series world TV premiere was on the Sky satellite channel Showcase TV in December 2011. The series is now available on the amazon.com TV service, Amazon Prime, free to subscribers.  Scenario  The show begins in the year 3034 when humans have become emotionless drones bent on expansion by destroying any alien species they encounter. A ship commanded by Captain Belinda Blowhard (Christian) called the Nemesis sets out to destroy an alien race called the Reptids, who plan to unleash a biological weapon that would reawaken all human emotion. The Reptids' aim is to unleash the emotion of compassion, hoping that the emotion would stop humanity from its destructive endeavors. The weapon is released on the crew of the Nemesis as the evading Reptid ship time travels back into the early 21st century; the Nemesis, the only ship with time-traveling capabilities, pursues the Reptids to the past  only to be overwhelmed by their own emotions. Now lost in the 21st century, they aim to tackle their emotions while trying to discover a cure and prevent the Reptids from succeeding.  Trivia  In an interview with David Clensy of the Bristol Evening Post in November 2008, the show‚Äôs co-creator Jonathan Brown revealed how making the show may have literally saved his life. He said: \\"Early on in the project, I discovered that I had a brain tumour. In fact, I‚Äôm very lucky. I wouldn‚Äôt have known about the tumour if it hadn‚Äôt been for the medical I needed to take to get insurance for the project.

Deriving its name from the full-size Ford LTD model line, the intermediate LTD II consolidated the Ford Torino and Gran Torino model lines, with the Ford Elite replaced by the Ford Thunderbird. Offered in a two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and station wagon, the LTD II also served as a basis for the final generation of the Ford Ranchero coupe utility. During its production, the Lincoln-Mercury Division sold the LTD II under the Mercury Cougar badge, replacing the Mercury Montego. The design of the Ford LTD II is notable as one of the largest vehicles ever produced as an intermediate, released just as the entire American auto industry began a period of downsizing. In terms of exterior footprint compared to full-size sedans, the LTD II is longer in length and wheelbase and wider than the later Ford LTD Crown Victoria, Ford Crown Victoria, Ford Five Hundred, and the Ford Taurus (fifth, sixth, and seventh-generation versions)  Background  leftthumb1974 Ford Gran Torino Brougham (LTD II predecessor) For the 1977 model year, Ford Motor Company made substantial revisions to its intermediate segment product lines involving both the Ford and Mercury brands. As part of the model changes, several product lines were given mid-cycle updates. To further revive interest, other model lines were consolidated to reduce internal competition and overlap. Central to the model revision was the discontinuation of the Ford Torino, Gran Torino, and Ford Elite. While the Torino chassis and body was given an extensive update to extend its lifespan, the Torino/Gran Torino became the Ford LTD II (\\"II\\" to distinguish the intermediate model line from the full-size LTD). Alongside a massive exterior update, the Ford Elite became the Ford Thunderbird, allowing Ford to better compete against the Chevrolet Monte Carlo (and its various General Motors counterparts) and the Chrysler Cordoba, reducing potential overlap between the Thunderbird and the Continental Mark V. As Ford discontinued the Torino, Mercury replaced the Montego, as it expanded the Mercury Cougar nameplate to its entire intermediate line (with the previous Cougar becoming the highest-trim Cougar XR7 counterpart of the Thunderbird).  Design overview  = Chassis = The LTD II utilizes the body on frame construction shared with the 1972-1976 Torino/Montego. As with the LTD, the LTD II utilized a full perimeter frame; to isolate road shock from the body, the frame was fitted with fourteen rubber body mounts and five cross members. On the rear suspension, the four-link solid rear axle utilized coil springs. The LTD II derived much of its powertrain line from the 1974 Torino, with one exception: in the interest of fuel economy, the 460 V8 was dropped from all Ford and Mercury intermediates, with the 302 V8 making its return as the standard engine (outside of California). As options, Ford offered the 351M V8 and the 351 Windsor V8, with a 400 cubic-inch V8 serving as the largest engine offering. For 1979, the 400 V8 was discontinued. = Body = Although the transition from the Torino to the LTD II is theoretically a mid-cycle update, Ford stylists would make several styling changes to introduce the new model line, moving away from the Coke-bottle styling that dominated the exterior of its Torino/Montego predecessor. Though limited funds precluded a complete redesign of the exterior, the roofline and all sheetmetal from the doors rearward were given an extensive update. Adopting much of the design language of the redesigned Thunderbird, the roofline was given larger, straight-edged windows (including optional opera windows) and a level beltline while the body retained relatively large fender flares. The LTD II carried over the use of the Elite's hood and front fenders with a restyled front end panel adapting vertically stacked rectangular headlamps and a new grille. The rear end adopted styling elements of the full- size Ford LTD. Due to the cost of redesigning the rear quarter side panels, the LTD II station wagon was produced with sheet metal nearly unchanged from the earlier Mercury Montego line; the station wagon was discontinued after 1977. The LTD II was produced in three trim levels, base-trim \\"S\\", standard- trim, and the luxury-minded LTD II Brougham. Bucket seats with console and floor shifter were available on base- and Brougham-level coupes.

As the LTD II made its 1977 debut, Chevrolet introduced downsized versions of the Chevrolet Impala and Caprice; although the LTD II was marketed as a competitor against the Chevrolet Malibu, the intermediate LTD II presented with a larger exterior footprint than the Impala (though with a smaller interior). The downsizing of the General Motors full-size line was met with success, with the Impala/Caprice becoming the best-selling 1977 model line. Also, internal competition from its nearly identical platform mate the newly downsized Thunderbird (with its much lower base price) deflected sales from the LTD II two-door models. For 1978, the LTD II met a much larger degree of competition, as Ford introduced the Ford Fairmont as the replacement for the long-running Ford Maverick. Though officially considered a compact (nearly two feet shorter and seven inches narrower than the LTD II), the interior dimensions of the Fairmont entered close enough into the midsize segment as downsizing extended beyond full-size vehicles. Along with its slow sales, the potential for model overlap with the Fairmont led to the discontinuation of the LTD II station wagon. For 1979, the LTD II effectively became obsolete as Ford introduced the downsized Ford LTD. In comparison to the LTD II, the downsized LTD was 11 inches shorter in length and 4 inches shorter in wheelbase, an inch narrower, and 500 pounds lighter; despite the smaller exterior footprint, the LTD rivaled its full-size predecessor in interior space. As the Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar were downsized to the Ford Fox platform for 1980, the Ford Torino chassis was discontinued after 1979. After 1979, the Ford Ranchero was indirectly replaced by the Ford Ranger, as the coupe utility pickup segment was phased out in favor of compact pickup trucks in the United States. After its 1979 discontinuation, the Ford LTD II never saw a direct successor in the Ford product line. In 1983, the Ford LTD model name returned to the mid-size segment, with Ford renaming the Granada as part of a mid-cycle redesign. After 1986, this vehicle was replaced by the Ford Taurus, largely marking the end of Ford LTD nameplate in North America.  Venezuela  Ford manufactured the LTD II in Venezuela badged as the Fairlane and Fairlane 500. All three body styles were available.

History The tenth Duke of Beaufort, Master of the Beaufort for sixty years Hunting with hounds in the area dates back to 1640, primarily deer but also foxes, and was led by the Marquis of Worcester. In 1762, Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort, decided to focus on foxhunting after an unsuccessful day hunting deer. From that point on, the Dukes of Beaufort have participated in the hunt, often acting as Master of the hunt. Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort held the position for 60 years, gaining a reputation as \\"the greatest fox-hunter of the twentieth century\\", and was eventually known simply by the nickname, 'Master'. Hunt The hunt country covers a area of land between Cirencester and Bath to the north and south and between Malmesbury and Nailsworth to the east and west, although only of land was usable by 2013. The hunt goes out on four days of the week during the hunting season, which continues for about 125 days of the year. Legal background Although \\"hunting wild mammals with a dog\\" in its traditional form was made unlawful in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004, which came into effect in 2005, the Beaufort Hunt continues to hunt, taking advantage of exemptions stated in Schedule 1 of the Act, which allow some previously unusual forms of hunting wild mammals with dogs to continue, such as \\"hunting... for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal\\". Trail hunting and mounted exercising of hounds are both unaffected by the Act and consequently are favoured by many hunts in Great Britain. In 2005 the Beaufort changed its rules to ensure that it would hunt within the new law.

Its keel was laid down on 13 March 1950 at Krasnoye Sormovo as a Project 613 unit (NATO : ). It was launched on 21 October, and delivered to Baku on the Caspian Sea on 1 November for tests, then transferred north via inland waterways in December. It was commissioned into the Northern Fleet on 2 December 1952, and operated there until mid-1957. Beginning in July 1957, S-80 was overhauled at Severodvinsk and converted to Project 644 (\\"Whiskey Twin-Cylinder\\") guided missile submarine, by having launch tubes for two SS-N-3 Shaddock anti-ship missiles fitted externally. It returned to sea in April 1959. Sinking During the night of 26 January 1961, S-80 was operating in the Barents Sea at snorkel depth on its diesel engines. The ocean was at sea state 6 and air temperature was . At 01:27 on 27 January, the boat dropped below snorkel depth, which should have caused the automatic snorkel valve to shut, preventing water from entering the snorkel system. However, the de-icing system that should have warmed the valve with hot water from the diesel engines had been switched off, and the valve had become jammed with ice. The diesel engines failed immediately as seawater flooded their air intakes. The machinist in the fifth compartment who discovered the flooding became confused by the complex array of valves, and did not shut the ventilation flapper valve quickly enough. By the time he located the correct handwheel, the valve spindle had been bent by the force of the flooding water. As the compartment filled, the boat's trim became uncontrollable. As its up-angle passed 45 degrees, the boat slowed, coming to a halt and then falling backward, gathering sternway and sinking until it grounded. The second, third, and fourth compartments were crushed, though 24 crewmen survived in the after compartments. Their attempts to escape the wrecked submarine using IDA-51 apparatuses failed, and all 68 officers and men of S-80 were lost. Their fate remained unknown for seven and a half years. Recovery thumb On 23 June 1968, salvage vessel Altay discovered the wreck of a submarine at 70¬∞01‚Ä≤23‚Ä≥N 36¬∞35‚Ä≤22‚Ä≥E, at a depth of . The crew inspected the wreck with its bathyscape and identified it as S-80. A government commission studied the report and ordered Operation \\"Depth,\\" the salvage of the wreck. The Nikolayevsk Shipyard built Karpaty, a special salvage vessel equipped to raise the sunken submarine. Operation \\"Depth\\" was carried out by a task force of the Northern Fleet consisting of groups of trawlers and a destroyer under the command of Captain First Rank S. Minchenko. The wreck was lifted from the ocean floor on 9 June 1969 and transported to Mys Teriberskiy, suspended under Karpaty in slings. There, it was lowered to the bottom of Zavalishin Harbor at a depth of on 12 July. On 24 July 1969, S-80 was raised to the surface. During August, a government commission began studying the wreck under the management of Hero of the Soviet Union Vice Admiral Grigory Shchedrin. The commission determined not only the immediate causes of the boat's loss, but also that two further errors had compounded the accident: the crew never attempted to shift propulsion to the electric motors, and they never performed an emergency ballast tank blow.

The second Goemon game released in North America, it follows The Legend of the Mystical Ninja and features hybrid elements of platform games and action- adventure games. The story follows Goemon's struggles to prevent the Peach Mountain Shoguns gang from turning Japan into a Westernized fine arts theater. The plot calls for three cinematic musical features and battles between giant robots; like other Ganbare Goemon games, it is peppered with surrealist humor and anachronisms. Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon sold nearly 200,000 copies worldwide. Reviewers praised its graphics, gameplay, and humorous plot.  Gameplay  Players navigate Goemon through forests, fields, dungeons, and other three-dimensional models of feudal Japanese places. Goemon and his friends can walk or run, jump, attack, and use special abilities to cross terrain, pick up money, and defeat adversaries. Players control only one of four characters at a time but can cycle through them with the press of a button. Hearts at the bottom of the screen show a character's health. If hit by an enemy and damage is taken, a character loses a heart. Some items and acts replenish strength, and a Maneki-neko (Luck Cat) adds a heart to the overall health. If all hearts are lost, the player restarts at the entrance to the field map they died in and the player's number of lives declines by one. If the player loses all lives, the game restarts at the last point saved or at the beginning of the game if a Controller Pak is not used. alt=A huge robot that looks like a Kabuki performer facing the player, who is inside the cockpit of another robot, a sunset background, and meters inside the cockpit reading \\"Enemy 2000\\", \\"Ryo 345\\", \\"Oil 465\\" Traveling through Japan, players visit towns and coffeehouses safe from enemies, where they can eat in restaurants or sleep in inns to refill strength and buy armor or riceballs‚Äîa self-acting item that refills health by itself. Many interactive non-player characters populate cities and talk with other characters to uncover plot devices or idle gossip. Players save their progress in towns with a Controller Pak at the inns or at the entrance to some dungeons. Some places are impassable barring the use of special abilities unlocked by completing minigames. For example, Ebisumaru must hide in a giant's cupboard to learn self-shrinking magic, an art that allows passing through small holes. The player has two wayfaring tools: a status screen shows found items, weapons, and player characters and a map screen shows where they are in Japan. In dungeons, the map screen shows the building's floorplan if they have the item Mr. Elly Fant. At the end of each dungeon is a boss, a more difficult than normal enemy with hearts of its own. Beating a boss can trigger a cutscene, after which Goemon appears outside the dungeon or helms his giant robot friend Impact to thwart an enemy robot (although not mentioned in the manual, these segments of gameplay support the Rumble Pak accessory). These sequences begin with a music video and a high-speed minigame in which Impact must smash structures and avoid hazards while racing across the countryside. The points gained by destroying buildings determine how many health points (measured in oil) Impact will have in the coming battle. Players control Impact from a cockpit behind his eyes where gauges show enemy and player health and ammunition. Impact can punch, kick, defend, reel in opponents with the chain pipe, and use projectile weaponry, including nasal bullets and a laser. Once a boss is defeated, a cutscene of the enemy exploding shows, and the game returns to normal exploration-based play. At the very end is the last boss whose defeat unlocks the ending. Collecting all the fortune cats and beating the game enables an Impact tournament mode with a special image of the robots as the prize for winning.  Plot  = Characters = The protagonist of Mystical Ninja is Goemon, a hot-blooded, kiseru-wielding ninja with blue, bushy hair based loosely on the legendary thief Ishikawa Goemon. The lord of Oedo asks him to find those who maimed Oedo Castle. Goemon lives in Oedo Town and is friends with Ebisumaru, a strange, gluttonous fat man who wears a blue bandana. Ebisumaru is defined as lazy and perverted. Their kunai-throwing friend Sasuke is a mechanical ninja (made by the Wise Man of Iga) who enjoys hot baths and Japanese tea. Rounding out the heroes is Yae, a fierce sword- wielding kunoichi, who happens upon Goemon's band in Zazen Town. The villains of the game hail from the organization Peach Mountain Shoguns and include a gang of four \\"weirdos\\" led by Spring Breeze Dancin' (Danshin Harukaze) and Kitty Lily (Margaret Ranko).Goemon: You...you WEIRDO! / Baron: You keep calling me weirdo... / [Girl] I was forced to see the weirdo's dance ever single day...Awake or asleep, it was the weirdo dance, weirdo dance, weirdo dance...It's driving me nuts! They intend to transform Japan into a stage for their talents. = Story = While shopping in Oedo Town, Goemon and Ebisumaru feel the ground quake as a peach-shaped flying object sails overhead.Ebisumaru: I thought that I could negotiate a discount...with my hypnotic dance. The vessel fires a laser at Oedo Castle, turning it into a European-style castle with spires and flags. Worried for the safety of the Lord of Oedo and his daughter, Goemon and Ebisumaru retrieve a chain pipe from Mt. Fuji and assault the castle. Inside is Baron, a member of the fashion- loving Gang of Four who reveals he was sent to turn the castle into a stage.Baron: My name is Baron! / Baron: I've come to make Oedo Castle a beautiful stage!. Goemon shrugs him off and defeats the King Robot Congo to free the Lord and find a \\"miracle item\\". The Lord asks Goemon to catch them and gives a Super Pass for access to the roads of Japan. Goemon sets out to the Wise Man's house for assistance, but the house explodes as he approaches. A fuming Baron comes forth and mans his kabuki robot. Goemon finds a Triton shell in the rubble that can call Impact, who lays ruin to the kabuki robot. In Zazen Town, Goemon finds Yae, who claims the troublemakers responsible are Flake Gang members named the Peach Mountain Shoguns. Yae joins Goemon, and they learn that children with dancing talent have been kidnapped around the region. Goemon and his friends must also fight against Benkei, a gatekeeper blocking the Gojo Ohashi Bridge leading out of Zazen Town. In order to defeat him, Goemon needs help from a young fisherman named Ushiwaka. It is hinted that Benkei and Ushiwaka are kind of rivals. Ashamed at his loss against Goemon and his friends, the man offers Goemon the mechanical robot Sasuke, thrown there by the explosion of the Wise Man's house.Benkei: Aaaaaaaaaah...to be defeated in the same manner as I was by Ushiwaka...Please, I beg you! Don't tell anyone that I lost, please...I'll let you pass the bridge at will, and I'll give you something from my collection... Goemon: Which is? Ebisumaru: Wow, wow! It's our friend, Sasuke! Goemon accepts the unconscious, powerless Sasuke and walks to Kii-Awaji island, where the dragon-powered passenger ferry has been stopped by the dragon's sudden craze. Goemon teleports to the dragon and finds a Gang of Four member named Colon who used the dragon to kidnap children; he then breaks Colon's mind-control device. The dragon turns back to human and crashes near a shrine. The human calls himself Koryuta, son of the Dragon God, and apologizes for the kidnappings. He pledges help in transporting the heroes across Japan, and claims the kids are at the Dogo Hot Springs.Koryuta: I remember going to the Dogo Hot Springs, just west at Iyo. Goemon travels to Iyo but finds the Hot Springs closed; the only entrance is a mouse hole. He learns from travelers that sweets in the Zazen Town shrine can make a person smaller. Ebisumaru offers to steal the sweets. With the dwarf power the group infiltrate the Ghost Toys Castle, a dark house of traps, toys, and a giant pool table. Colon faces Goemon with the robot Dharmanyo, but is crushed and lets go his miracle item. The hidden man aboard the peach ship at Oedo comes out calling himself Spring Breeze Dancin'.Goemon: Who are you?! / Mystery man: Aha! / Mystery man: I'm the leader of the Peach Mountain Shoguns! / Mystery man: In the fresh spring breeze, sha, la, la, I come alive! La, la... / Mystery man: These beautiful visions appear before my eyes, la, la... / Mystery man: Yes! / Mystery man: I am... you know I am... the one they call...Spring Breeze Dancin'! Ebisumaru: What an intro... He pokes fun at the group with nicknames and instructs Colon to retreat. With the children liberated, Goemon follows Colon to the Chu-goku Region, where he revives Sasuke with two batteries. They enter the Festival Temple, a Peach Mountain base. They destroy a guard robot, prompting Gang of Four member Sharon to appear with Kitty Lily, the second leader of the Peach Mountain Shoguns. Lily boasts that Kyushu is a stage and asks Sharon to return to base after buying some foundation.Lily: Kyu-shu- has already become our Stage, la, la... / Goemon: What did you say?! / Sharon: Hey, that's great! Does that mean I can return now? / Lily: Sure... / Lily: But before you go, I'm out of foundation... / Lily: Get the usual best for me! Okay? / Sharon: Uh... all right, but you always take forever to pay me back. Alarmed, Goemon and friends rush off to the bridge to Kyushu and find Omitsu on her way to deliver dumplings. Stunned by Omitsu's seeming ruggedness, Goemon forgets to warn her of danger, and the island rises into odd thunder clouds in the sky. A fortune teller instructs the group to set out north to Mount Fear to find a way to Kyushu. After necessary weight training to remove obstacles, Goemon finds the northeast Festival Village and learns of a psychic witch. The witch summons Wise Man, who tells Goemon to gather the fourth miracle items at the Stone Circle near Festival Village for passage into outer space and Kyushu.Wise Man: Retrieve [Miracle Items] from the four Flake Gang leaders of Peach Mountain... / Wise Man: ... and take it to the altar of the Stone Circle in [Ugo], to the west... / Wise Man: Then you'll be able to go to outer space! / Goemon: Awesome... / Goemon: But Wise Man! How do you know?! / Wise Man: Ahem! That's because I'm... / Wise Man: The WISE MAN! (the witch also reveals that it was indeed Sasuke who had accidentally destroyed his home by accidentally dropping a firecracker bomb). Goemon investigates reports of stolen food in the village while Yae undergoes training to become a mermaid. The two paths converge when Yae finds the Gourmet Submarine, a Peach Mountain vessel containing hordes of food. After sidestepping grills and swimming through gallons of soup, Goemon confronts Poron, the final weirdo, who jokes that he lost the last miracle item in Zazen Town. Lily enters by hologram to ridicule the party, but is rudely interrupted by Dancin', who continues to call Goemon \\"Fernandez\\". Dancin' instructs Poron to activate the ship's self-destruct sequence. Goemon escapes by calling Impact and defeats a mermaid giant robot. In Zazen Town, a kappa named Kihachi desires to trade the miracle item for cucumber made by the priest's son. The son sits on a precipice inaccessible save through jumping training; Sasuke volunteers in the Chu-goku Region and acquires the miracle item. At the Stone Circle, the Pemopemo God awakens and asks the heroes if they have the courage to venture to outer space. Goemon affirms their decision and the group enters Kyushu through the Gorgeous Music Castle. They discover Sogen Town has been converted to a garden city with European architecture. Goemon locates Omitsu and learns that Dancin' and Lily can be found past a rigid gate‚Äîaccessible only with the help of Wise Man. Stunned to find him alive, Goemon learns that in exchange for building the Instant Stage Beam and mechanical robots, the Peach Mountain Shoguns gave Wise Man five car magazines and a muscle car poster.Wise Man: Well... in exchange for a muscle car poster and five car magazines... Enraged to learn of his home's demise, Wise Man helps Goemon enter the castle. Kitty Lily and Dancin' confront the heroes with the elaborate musical number Gorgeous My Stage before a self-destruct sequence begins. Goemon summons Impact to fly into outer space, where he thwarts the giant peach ship Balberra and duels Lily and Dancin' in their personal battle robot. Dancin' mocks Goemon in defeat, and Impact sends their robot's head far into outer space to reveal a picture of Dancin' and Lily smiling among the stars. Goemon returns to Japan to find a horde of girls rushing towards him, and awaits their praise for saving Japan. The group is shocked to find the girls angry over the apparent death of their idol, Spring Breeze Dancin'. = Humor = The story of Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon, a quest to thwart dancers in a peach-shaped spaceship from using laser weaponry to convert Japan to a giant stage and its citizens to loyal dancers, is steeped in surrealist and Japanese humor. Many reviewers and writers commented on the humor in the plot and dialogue. The game's dialogue is peppered with offbeat humor, and a few instances of sexual innuendo. In the Japanese version, Wise Man collected hentai magazines and pornographic posters rather than automotive publications. A laugh track punctuates certain jokes.  Development and audio  Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka. It was first titled Ganbare Goemon 5, then Legend of the Mystical Ninja. The Japanese producers wished to break the series' numerical naming pattern to stress that Mystical Ninja differed from its forefathers. Originally made with a two-player mode, this feature was scrapped months before the Japanese release. Early development pictures showed Impact battling in a modern city against a handgun-wielding foe. Later images touted the battle against the Wartime Kabuki Robot Kashiwagi taking place over a forest and village. Konami released many renders of Goemon posing and making faces for magazine previews. A 60‚Äì70% complete build of the game was featured at E3 in June 1997, suffering from graphical clipping and camera issues. Konami later presented a mostly finished build at the Tokyo Game Show in September 1997. Developers aimed to make the game \\"very visual\\" with new content, and the game's marketers echoed this by using large, colorful advertisements. Konami targeted children, among whom the series is popular in Japan, by scheduling appearances of a Goemon mascot at some elementary school gymnastics sessions. The game's later success prompted the production of an animated television show. The series followed Goemon as he struggled against evil after being transported to modern society, where he befriended an elementary school student. Its release in the United States was planned for winter 1997, then February 1998, but was ultimately delayed to two more months. Mystical Ninja featured a cartridge size of 128 megabits, designed to be much larger than most of its peers and predecessor games to allow high quality musical numbers and voice samples. In total, there are three musical numbers‚ÄîTheme of Ganbare Goemon, I Am Impact, and Gorgeous My Stage. They feature the talents of Hironobu Kageyama, Ichirou Mizuki, and Toshihiro Tachibana and Etsuyo Ota respectively. The song's main soundtrack is composed of a mix of traditional Japanese and modern instruments integrated in original arrangements. The dungeons feature minimalistic songs which grow in complexity and length as the player proceeds deeper into the lair. The soundtrack on whole is a collaborative effort by four composers.COMPOSER Shigeru Araki - Kato Yusuke - Saiko Miki - Yasumasa Kitagawa The musical numbers, with forty tunes from the game and one remix of I Am Impact, were released October 3, 1997 on CD. The soundtrack was later extracted from Read- only memory and presented in Nintendo Ultra 64 Sound Format on May 9, 2005; it is one of the most downloaded releases at USF Central.  Reception  Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon sold 55,000 units in America and 141,000 units in Japan. American reviewers praised the game's story and setting for its quirky, unique flavor; Nintendo Power called Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon a \\"blend of history, fantasy, and science fiction,\\" writing that the game \\"never failed to enchant or intrigue.\\" Dialogue was considered likably memorable, whether relying on clever puns or surrealist humor. The Japanese songs in Mystical Ninja's title and Impact sequences, unusual to Western audiences, augmented the bizarre humor. One Japanese reviewer claimed the Impact song cultivated a heroic atmosphere for ensuing battles. Gameplay was similar to that of Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda series, offering responsive play control and ability-driven progression. Mystical Ninja featured a simple controller setup and easy learning curve to this end. The minigames, Impact sequences, and secret tournament mode bolstered replay value, and reviewers praised the game's graphical finesse in animating characters creating the Japanese countryside in three dimensions. A reviewer for The News Tribune considered the presentation \\"a terrific upgrade from the Super Nintendo version\\". However, the game was found to be prone to slowdowns in detail-heavy areas, and one reviewer decried the inability to pause the game during Impact battles. Another found play control \\"not as fluid as it is in Super Mario 64\\". alt=A large room with dark metallic walls and lights, a floor flooded with bright blue water, floating Japanese sushi plate platforms, a section of the room composed of sushi rice, two enemy characters resembling sushi, the character Yae in purple with green hair, a status bar denoting that the player has 7925 ryo, a sword equipped, almost full health, six lives, and a rice ball for emergency health Critics enjoyed the soundtrack's integration of pop and shamisen-laden traditional Japanese music. A writer for IGN declared that the songs would \\"permanently burn themselves into your brain...something that can't be said for most N64 titles\\"‚Äîechoed by Japanese reviewers who noted that the music would not grow tiresome. Mystical Ninja was also commended for high- quality voice samples and sound effects. Reviewers were divided concerning the efficiency of the camera system‚Äîmost considered it inferior to Super Mario 64's, citing instances of clipping issues and resulting in \\"extremely difficult\\" platform jumping sequences. The game features a few sequences of long travel between towns, regarded as dull and unenjoyable. Reviewers disapproved of the game's short play time, estimating that Mystical Ninja could be completed in only ten to fifteen hours. The objections came in spite of the developers anticipating the problem and trying to mitigate it by requiring players to return to certain locations. Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon requires a Controller Pak to save‚Äîa rarity in early Nintendo 64 titles which garnered negative attention from both American and Japanese critics. One reviewer decried not being able to save his progress inside castles, which become \\"harder and more complex\\" with time. Reviewers fluent with past Ganbare Goemon games argued that the absence of the series' usually intuitive minigames and a two-player mode hampered Mystical Ninja's replay value, and a Japanese reviewer felt that the transition to three dimensions had deprived the game of the traditional Goemon feel. Mystical Ninja's localization was criticized often. The plot and poorly-translated jokes tended to confuse players. A critic for The Tampa Tribune wrote, \\"upon popping in the...cartridge and listening to the opening theme song, you'll realize something about this game. It's Japanese.\\" He added, \\"attempts at humor often come across as rather inane. Early conversations with village residents only add to the confusion.\\" Others countered that the strange localization often compounded the surrealist humor through the use of weird, unusual English and grammar. One critic stressed, \\"talk to everyone you meet... Everybody has something interesting to say.\\" A writer from GameSpot remarked that the game was translated surprisingly well given the sheer number of Japanese jokes and amount of innuendo. Next Generation lamented that Konami had not polished it more, holding that it otherwise might have been the \\"best N64 action/RPG\\". IGN's reviewer cautioned that though Mystical Ninja was billed as a role- playing game, it would differ from the expectations of Western fans. Critics noted that it would hold over gamers until the release of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time‚Äîprovided they played it with an open mind to avoid culture shock. A contributor for The Dallas Morning News concluded that the game \\"will please N64 owners starving for a decent adventure game... But players should rent it before they buy.\\" A reviewer for the Sentinel & Enterprise wrote in 2001 that while considered a \\"flawed 3D platformer\\", Mystical Ninja offered \\"quirky\\" fun \\"following the heels of Super Mario 64\\" by inviting players to \\"scale mountains, invade pagodas, and pilot giant robots in all-out fisticuffs to the rhythm of Japanese lyrics and pop tunes.\\" The game is rated 73.8% at GameRankings and received an 8.4 out of 10 rating by players at GameSpot.  Sequels  Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon was followed by a Game Boy game of the same name. Featuring gameplay similar to the Super Famicom title Ganbare Goemon 3: Shishij≈´rokubƒì no Karakuri Manji Gatame, the game presented a story in which Yae had been kidnapped by the Black Ship Gang. In 1999, Konami released Goemon's Great Adventure on the Nintendo 64‚Äîa 2.5D side-scroller with multiplayer support. Reviewers gave it high marks for recreating the feel of the older, 16-bit Goemon games and considered it the best side-scroller for the Nintendo 64. The final Goemon title for the Nintendo 64 was Goemon Mononoke Sugoroku, released in Japan on December 25, 1999. In Mononoke Sugoroku, players must collect Ofuda cards while navigating a board game. After a spate of sequels on the PlayStation line of consoles, Konami returned to the medieval, quirky Japanese themes of Mystical Ninja and its brethren on June 23, 2005 with Ganbare Goemon: T≈çkai D≈çch≈´ ≈åedo Tengu ri Kaeshi no Maki for the Nintendo DS.

Moro studied medicine in Graz, Austria, getting his M.D. in 1899. From 1901 to 1902 he worked with Theodor Escherich (1857‚Äì1911) in Vienna, the discoverer of the Escherichia coli bacterium. He was habilitated for pediatrics in Munich in 1906, and became a professor of pediatrics in the University of Heidelberg in 1911. Besides the Moro reflex he became also known for the following: * Proved the sterility of the normal small intestine * Discovered that breast-fed children have stronger bactericidal activity in their blood than bottle-fed ones * First described the irritable colon syndrome or recurrent abdominal pain (\\"Nabelkoliken\\") in children * Isolated the bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus from the stomach of children, which is caused by the souring of milk products * Developed the Moro test (percutaneous tuberculin reaction) * Coined the terms \\"first trimester\\" and \\"biological spring\\" * Invented \\"Moro's milk\\", an infant-feeding formula composed by full cream milk with added 3% flour, 5% butter and 5-7% sugar. * Invented Professor Moro's Carrot soup, which decreased the death rate of babies by diarrhea in Germany dramatically. * Published about his later famous \\"apple diet\\" to cure diarrhea symptoms In 1936, after the Nazis came to power, Moro resigned from his chair at the University of Heidelberg, alleging reasons of health. However the real motive was that he was married to Grete Moro, n√©e K√∂nigsvald, of Jewish origin. He started a private clinic at Mozartstrasse 10 (where a commemorative plaque is now affixed) and retired in 1948. Professor Moro's Carrot Soup In 1908, diarrhea killed many babies in Germany. Professor Moro, at that time the head of a children hospital in Heidelberg, found out by experiment that a simple carrot soup decreased the death rate of babies suffering from diarrhea by nearly 50% . The soup was made by pureeing 500 grams of peeled carrots in a blender, adding 1 liter of water, and then cooking it for one hour. After cooking, 3 grams of salt were added, along with enough water until the soup pot contained a total of 1 liter of liquid. A German study published in 2002 Wiley Online Abstract outlines that acidic oligosaccharides formed in aqueous extracts from carrots (carrot soup) may lead to less adherence of bacterial agents to the mucosal wall of the bowel, thus being a more effective treatment for acute gastrointestinal infections of children than glucose-electrolyte-solution oral rehydration. In 2009, experiments showed that Professor Moro's Carrot Soup can treat diarrhea caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Professor Moro's carrot soup (Article in German) Apple diet In 1929, Moro announced his later famous \\"apple diet\\" for the treatment of diarrheal conditions. The colleague August Heisler had pointed out to Moro the effect of apple days as an old folk remedy for intestinal catarrh. When the entire Eugenien Hall was infected with a small house infection of enteritis, all the children ate raw apple porridge. The further clinical trial confirmed the trial. In Moro's opinion, the tannin content of raw grated apples caused certain detoxification processes to alleviate the symptoms of dyspepsia, dysentery and agitation-like illnesses Personal Moro was married to Margareta H√∂nigswald. His son, Peter Moro, was a noted London architect. References Ignatius J. \\"Moro reflex\\" Ernst Moro 1874-1951. Duodecim. 1993;109(9):789-91. * Ernst Moro. Biography.

He pioneered the use of radios, airplanes, and electricity in the Arctic, brought back films and thousands of photographs of Arctic scenes, and put together a dictionary of the Inuktitut language. Early life Born in Provincetown, Massachusetts in 1874, MacMillan lived in Freeport, Maine after the deaths of both his parents in 1883 (his father died while captaining a Grand Banks fishing schooner) and 1886 (his mother died suddenly), and was educated at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, graduating in 1898 with a degree in geology. He later taught at Worcester Academy from 1903 to 1908. Personal life On March 18, 1935, MacMillan married Miriam Norton Look, the daughter of his long-time friends Jerome and Amy Look. Though MacMillan at first refused to let her accompany him north, Miriam soon convinced him of her willingness and ability to participate in his Arctic travels. She participated in several of his scientific and exploration trips to the Arctic and elsewhere. Arctic explorations Donald MacMillan in fur suit at wheel of ship Bowdoin c. 1922 After five years as a high school teacher, MacMillan caught the attention of explorer and fellow Bowdoin graduate Robert E. Peary when he saved the lives of nine shipwrecked people in two nights. Peary subsequently invited MacMillan to join his 1908 journey to the North Pole. Although MacMillan himself had to turn back at 84¬∞29' on March 14 because of frozen heels, Peary allegedly reached the Pole 26 days later. MacMillan spent the next few years traveling in Labrador, carrying out ethnological studies among the Innu and Inuit. He organized and commanded the ill-fated Crocker Land Expedition to northern Greenland in 1913. Unfortunately Crocker Land turned out to be a mirage. The expedition members were stranded until 1917, when Captain Robert A. Bartlett of the ship Neptune finally rescued them. On December 24, 1918, shortly after the armistice which ended the First World War, MacMillan was commissioned an ensign in the Naval Reserve Flying Corps. MacMillan was 44 years old at the time, making him one of the oldest ensigns in the history of the U.S. Navy. After the war, MacMillan began raising money for another Arctic expedition. In 1921, the schooner Bowdoin‚Äîthe namesake of MacMillan's alma mater‚Äîwas launched from East Boothbay, Maine and set sail for Baffin Island, where MacMillan and his crew spent the winter. The expedition was notable for taking along an amateur radio operator, Don Mix, who used station WNP (\\"Wireless North Pole\\") to keep them in contact with the outside world.John Dilks, Wireless North Pole Christmas, QST, December 2008, pp. 94-5. In 1923 there was concern about a new ice age and he again sailed toward the North Pole aboard the Bowdoin, sponsored by the National Geographical Society to look for evidence of advancing glaciers. In 1925 MacMillan led a scientific expedition backed by the National Geographical Society and financed primarily by the Chicago entrepreneur Eugene McDonald - which was accompanied by U.S. Navy personnel and planes commanded by Lt. Cmdr. Richard E. Byrd. The planes were to be used for aerial surveys of Baffin and Ellesmere Islands, investigation of the Greenland icecap, and reconnaissance of previously unexplored areas of the Arctic Sea. The aerial results proved to be disappointing due to severe weather conditions, unreliable engines and inadequate navigational tools (although Byrd would use this experience in preparing for his attempt to reach the North Pole the following year). The expedition is noted for the successful demonstration of SW radio in communications from the Arctic Region. In September 1926 MacMillan led a group of explorers which included three women and five scientists to Sydney, Nova Scotia. The team spent several months beforehand collecting flora and fauna in Labrador and Greenland. He believed it was possible that the ancient ruins off Sculpin Island, twenty miles from Nain, Labrador, are the remains of a Norse settlement 1,000 years old. On the side bordering the mainland MacMillan found what he considered the vestiges of ten or twelve houses. He estimated the age of the dwellings to be hundreds of years old according to the lichens which partially covered their foundations. However MacMillan could not say for certain if these had been built by Vikings. According to Inuit tradition the \\"stone igloos\\" were constructed by men who came from the sea in ships. Inuit called the site Tunitvik, meaning the place of the Norseman. MacMillan said the strongest argument that the Sculpin dwellings were of Viking origin was their resemblance to those he found in Greenland the previous year. World War II MacMillan was placed on the Naval Reserve Honorary Retired List with the rank of lieutenant commander on his 64th birthday in 1938.Register of Commissioned Officers of the U.S. Naval Reserve. July 1, 1939. Despite being past retirement age, he volunteered for active duty with the Navy during World War II. On May 22, 1941, he transferred the Bowdoin to the Navy for the duration of the war and served as her initial commanding officer before being transferred to the Hydrographic Office in Washington, DC. He was promoted to the rank of commander on June 13, 1942.U.S. Naval Reserve Register. 1 July 1944. Later life After the war, MacMillan continued his trips to the Arctic, taking researchers north and carrying supplies for the MacMillan-Moravian School he established in 1929. On June 25, 1954 MacMillan was promoted, by a special act of Congress, to rank of rear admiral on the Naval Reserve retired list in honor of his lifetime of service and achievement.The New York Times. June 25, 1954. Admiral MacMillan made his final trip to the Arctic in 1957 at age 82, and died in 1970 at the age of 95. He is buried in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where a main wharf is named after him. Honors In 1927, the Boy Scouts of America made MacMillan an Honorary Scout, a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to \\"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...\\". The other eighteen who were awarded this distinction were: Roy Chapman Andrews; Robert Bartlett; Frederick Russell Burnham; Richard E. Byrd; George Kruck Cherrie; James L. Clark; Merian C. Cooper; Lincoln Ellsworth; Louis Agassiz Fuertes; George Bird Grinnell; Charles A. Lindbergh; Clifford H. Pope; George Palmer Putnam; Kermit Roosevelt; Carl Rungius; Stewart Edward White; and Orville Wright. MacMillan Pier in Provincetown, Massachusetts is named in his honor. The bagpipe band at Robert E. Peary High School in Rockville, Maryland was formed and named after him with his permission in 1961. The adult MacMillan Pipe Band continues to this day, formed by the graduates of the high school pipe band. =Medals awarded by the United States Government=Peary Polar Expedition Medal *Naval Reserve Medal *American Defense Service Medal *American Campaign Medal *World War II Victory Medal References External links  * 1874 births 1970 deaths American explorers Baffin Island Bowdoin College alumni Crocker Land Expedition Explorers of the Arctic People from Freeport, Maine People from Provincetown, Massachusetts ","title":"Donald Baxter MacMillan"},{"id":"1833237","text":"¬´Ivan the Terrible and Malyuta Skuratov¬ª, by Grigory Sedov.

Rolling Stone once called him \\"The greatest songwriter in the English language\\". He sang and composed from the 1960s, and his rich and challenging songs have been recorded by more than 30 performers. He is best known for writing \\"The Dutchman\\", which was popularized by Steve Goodman and also recorded by Brendan Grace, Suzy Bogguss, Celtic Thunder, Liam Clancy, Norm Hacking, Anne Hills, Mara Levine and Si Khan, John McDermott, the New Kingston Trio, Gamble Rogers, Tom Russell, Jerry Jeff Walker, Robert James Waller, Josh White Jr., and Bernard Wrigley. Smith was also known for his whimsical songs such as \\"Zippy\\", \\"Famous in France,\\" and \\"Move Over Mister Gauguin.\\" Biography Smith was born in South Orange, New Jersey, United States.Smith's entry in Allmusic lists his birthdate as December 6, 1943, and his place of birth as Edmonton, London, England. This is due to confusion with Mike Smith, the former member of the Dave Clark Five, who was from Edmonton. He attended Catholic schools (Our Lady of the Valley and Our Lady of Sorrows), which would shape much of his writing. A notable example is his song \\"Sister Clarissa\\". Smith had three younger sisters and a brother and they were the basis for his autobiographical play, Michael, Margaret, Pat and Kate, originally presented at the Victory Gardens in Chicago. The play is Smith's story of his upbringing and family relationships surrounding his father's early death. While attending Passaic Valley Regional High School in Little Falls, New Jersey, he discovered the guitar and rock-and-roll. His earliest musical influence was Elvis Presley, although Roy Rogers was a close second. According to Smith, the music \\"ruined my grades,\\" however, his other love of English never suffered. An avid reader, Smith's command of the language has always shown in the literacy of his songs, and has inspired much of the acclaim he enjoyed. A Song Talk Magazine review commented that \\"[H]earing the songs of Michael Smith in this day and age is like reading an anthology of short stories by Hemingway after decades of only comic books.\\" After high school, Smith's family moved to Florida. Two years later, he started college and his interest in folk music blossomed. He cited The Kingston Trio and Harry Belafonte as his earliest folk influences. He spent three years of the 1960s working at a Miami venue called The Flick, playing six nights a week from 1966 to 1968. He was in a Peter, Paul and Mary-style trio for a couple of years which included his wife Barbara Barrow and fellow singer Ron Kickasola. They expanded into a rock band called Juarez and recorded one album for Decca before disbanding. Smith and his wife then played as an acoustic duo for most of the early 1970s. Steve Goodman's recording of \\"The Dutchman\\" in 1973 on his album Somebody Else's Troubles, formally introduced Smith's songs to a large audience, and propelled \\"The Dutchman\\" into becoming Smith's most popular song. Because Goodman was Chicago-based and had been playing several of Smith's songs in his act, it opened a lot of opportunities for Smith in Chicago. So, in 1976 Smith and Barrow moved from Detroit to Chicago, where he became a regular in the city's folk clubs for a couple of years, which allowed him to stop touring. Eventually though, the work began to dwindle and he took a day job as a clerk for Time magazine to pay the bills. He played a few festivals and a show at the Old Town School of Folk Music now and then, but aside from that, became inactive for about six years. He continued writing and his songs continued to get played and recorded by others all through that time. Besides \\"The Dutchman,\\" which Suzy Bogguss covered on her debut effort Suzy in 1981, Smith classics and their interpreters included \\"Spoon River\\", a song inspired by the poems of Edgar Lee Masters, which was also recorded by Goodman. Jimmy Buffett and Goodman both recorded \\"Elvis Imitators\\", Michael's tongue in cheek ode to the King's legions. \\"Dead Egyptian Blues,\\" a song about ex-pharaohs and their riches, was recorded by Trout Fishing in America. A couple of other Smith classics include \\"Crazy Mary\\", a song about the 'crazy lady next door' in everyone's life that Bonnie Koloc and also David Allan Coe recorded, and \\"Last Day of Pompeii\\", ‚Äì a smooth jazz number about the city's impending disaster, which appears on recordings by Trout Fishing in America, Anne Hills, Cathy Miller, and the swing recordings of Harmonious Wail. In 1986, Smith found himself regularly taking the stage again. He had started to work with Anne Hills, and Hills got Smith to record two albums for Flying Fish Records, while becoming his producer and touring partner. Smith recorded Michael Smith (1986) and Love Stories (1987.) Both albums have been reissued as a single CD, which is among Acoustic Guitar's list of essential singer- songwriter albums. Hills recorded her own album of Smith songs called October Child (1993). In the winter of 1987, Claudia Schmidt introduced Smith to theatrical director Frank Galati. It was Galati who asked Smith to write the music for Steppenwolf Theatre Company's production of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. The Steppenwolf Theatre, founded by Gary Sinise and John Malkovich, has a glowing reputation in Chicago and nationally, and The Grapes of Wrath became a huge success, playing in Chicago, London, San Diego, and on Broadway where it received Tony Awards for Best Play and Best Director. The success of The Grapes of Wrath allowed Smith to quit his job as a clerk at Time, and his work in theater brought both new dimensions to his writing and his performances. Smith recommenced performing regularly, both as a solo act and in a duet with Hills. He recorded his third album for Flying Fish, Time (1994), and recorded a duet album with Hills called Paradise Lost and Found (1999). He also continued to write music for theatre, including for a Colorado Children's Theatre production of The Snow Queen. Most notably though, in 1993 Chicago's Victory Gardens Theatre premiered his autobiographical play Michael, Margaret, Pat and Kate. The play won four Jeff Awards (the Chicago Theater Union's equivalent of the Tony), for Best Original Music, Best Production, Best Actor in a Revue, and Best New Work. February 2000 saw the official release of the music from Michael, Margaret, Pat and Kate by Wind River Records. Smith performed at dozens of major folk festivals including the Kerrville Folk Festival, Black Mountain Festival, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Owen Sound, Gamble Rogers Folk Festival, and Winnipeg Folk Festivals. He has also appeared on a number of radio programs including WUMB's Circle in the Stream, interviews with Studs Terkel on WFMT, a series of interviews on All Things Considered and Good Evening on NPR as well as interviews for the BBC in London for All Things Considered. He continued to write songs, tour regularly, do songwriting workshops as well as perform frequently with Hills. In 2009, Smith won the International Hans Christian Andersen Prize (Copenhagen) for The Snow Queen. The honor is awarded to people who promote and interpret Hans Christian Andersen and his works. He died from colon cancer on August 3, 2020.

The blaster's design is a humanoid figure at the centre, from which a specially made marble, is launched (but even other marbles of the same size may be used). Different attachments are used to change a B-Daman's accuracy, power, balance, control, and rapid fire. They are customizable and each have a special gimmick. In the English language Battle B-Daman toys, the marbles are referred to as \\"B-Dama\\". In all cases they are simply called \\"marbles\\" (; biidama, hence the name \\"B-Daman\\") in Japan. TimelineIn 2004, Hasbro collaborated with Takara and Fox Entertainment Group to bring it to the Japan and USA. *In 2005, Hasbro licensed the \\"Battle B-Daman\\" configuration of the toy. *In 2005, Takara licensed the show to Fox Entertainment Group. Game rules Depending on how it is played, there are different sets of game rules. In Hasbro's \\"Battle B-Daman\\" tournament set, it has the following 10 games: *Direct hit battle (DHB): Shoot at each other's B-Daman until opponent's B-Daman's switch is hit. In the \\"Zero\\" system, this causes a cap to block the barrel (originally a specially made game piece would pop out). Direct Hit Battle armor is required. (Note: Hasbro only sells the Zero, and blastercore versions) *Tag Team DHB: Similar to DHB, only you have teammates who you can tag in when you are not being fired at. You cannot tag in your tag team partner if their armor has been disabled. *DHB havoc: Similar to DHB, but the opposing B-Daman is behind target barricades placed in B-dabattlefield. *B-Daman invasion: Shoot at the battle puck in the arena until it reaches opponent's baseline. This is known as \\"Battle Hockey\\" in Japan. *Battle hammer: Try to shoot the puck as far as you can using 5 shots. *Ultimate strike: A classic game of shooting down as many target pins as possible in one shot. *Shoot the gap: Shoot between standing target pins while avoiding hitting them. *B-Daman assault: Flip your opponent's gates in 30 seconds. *B-Daman blast: Flip 4 gates with 6 marbles. *Hard target: Shooting battle pin hidden behind target barricades. *B-DaChallenge: Each player sets up a shot and tries to complete it. If they are successful, their opponent must complete it. If they fail you win. *B-Dama from 50 cm away. Score is determined by number of B-DaBalls that are shot out of the circle. *EZ battle getter: Place a pencil between opposing B-DaPlayer, then try to push the pencil to opponent by firing for 30 seconds. A match is won by pushing the pencil to opponent's side. *EZ through the gate: Place 5 pins in a row, with each pin 5 cm away from the next closest pin. Fire from 60 cm away for 10 rounds. Each B-Dama passes between gap scores 10 points, while each pin knocked down loses 10 points. *EZ broken three: Make a row of 3 targets with rubber(gomu) erasers, then fire at target from 50 cm away. Winner is determined by how long it takes to break the targets. *EZ sky jump: Place a paper cup with opening on top, then fire at the cup from 50 cm away for 3 shots. Winner is determined by how many B-DaBalls are shot into the cup. Unless otherwise stated, the following rules use limited model B-Daman as targets: *EZ battle hockey: Same as EZ battle getter, but can use PET bottle (clear plastic beverage bottle) instead of pencil. *EZ time attack: Fire at a row of targets from 50 cm away. Adjust number of targets and firing distance as necessary. Winner is determined by the amount of firing time. *EZ battle bowling: Same as the regular EZ battle bowling. Tournaments Game tournaments are by Hasbro in Canada every summer. Takara hosts many tournaments year round in Japan, much like Beyblade. B-Daman series B-Daman was first produced in 1993, modeled after Bomberman, and hence was called \\"Bomberman B-Daman\\". =Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden series=Bakugaiden (1995): Assembled from western armour-themes parts, which was the basis for Battle B-Daman. *Bakugaiden II (1996): Was sold with Super Bomberman 4. *Bakugaiden III (1997): B-Daman can be turned into vehicles. *Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden IV (1998): Unlike previous series, it is only sold in unassembled form, with interchangeable parts. Starting from the premier of the TV series, kits are no longer numbered. *Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden V (1999): =Battle B-Daman series= Battle B-Daman is a manga series that debuted in 2003, accompanied by a toyline.

This series specialized on shooting. It uses pistol type grip and trigger, making it look vaguely like a pistol. It is also compatible with some Battle B-Daman parts. The pistol grips and triggers vary in both size, color, and functionality. Crash only made 40 models before being canceled. Many import players liked the design, but Japanese parents believed that gun models were too violent for their kids just as their kids can enjoy, handle and be allowed to see guns on TV. * Crash Series Used simple gimmicks such as delta core, roller core, etc. Only barrels and magazines from Cartridge B-Daman were backwards compatible. * Synchronized Weapon System Series Add the gimmick of firing a Crash weapon from the handle as well as introducing much more complex gimmicks. =B-Daman Crossfire= The latest series of B-Daman which has a toyline and anime series. It is completely different compared to the previous B-Daman. Its main character is a boy named Riki. B-Daman Crossfire was directly followed by B-Daman Fireblast. =B-Daman Fireblast= The newest B-Daman Crossfire series is called B-Daman Fireblast (known as Cross Fight B-Daman eS in Japan), which introduced emblem charge attacks.

It is considered one of Virginia's ghost towns due to its history as a decoy airfield during World War II, then partially developed as an African-American mental hospital, before that project was abandoned. World War II The history of the Tract prior to World War II is unremarkable. During the war, however, the area was converted into a false city, its structure closely resembling that of Richmond. Richmond sat nearby to the west of the tract. It is widely accepted that the premise behind the work was to serve as a decoy for German or Japanese bombers on night raids. In theory, when reports would come from the eastern Virginia cities that enemy bombers were flying overhead, the city would cut power to its residents and businesses. At the same time, the lights would come up on Elko Tract - roads built in roughly the same pattern as the city, and a false landing strip arranged identically to the nearby airport, would convince the bombers that they had reached their target. The bombs would then harmlessly fall on an uninhabited stretch of land, and the bombers would return, thinking they had successfully attacked Richmond. World War II ended without any attempt by the Axis Powers to attack Richmond. Control of the land then passed to the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Wass also holds the record for the most wickets taken for Nottinghamshire - 1633 for 20.34 each. Tall and solidly built, Wass had a highly rhythmic run-up that allowed him to be, in his prime, fast through the air. However, it was his leg-cutter that made him formidable, and Wass unlike most fast bowlers of the time was very dangerous after rain but less effective on a firm pitch when the ball did not turn.Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers‚Äô Almanac 1954; p. 930 He also had a very difficult slower ball that on his best days caught many batsmen unaware.See The Times, 18 June 1902; ‚ÄòSporting Intelligence‚Äô Wass was a very moderate fieldsman and had no pretensions to be a batsman ‚Äì though he did score 56 against Derbyshire in 1906, he was dropped four times in doing so.Pardon, Sydney H.

This time wet weather continued almost continuously all summer, allowing Wass and Hallam to dominate match after match to such an extent that they took 298 wickets between them in just nineteen games and Nottinghamshire won fifteen of these and were never defeated. Nobody else bar John Gunn did any serious work, and Gunn took only 25 wickets in seventeen matches in which he bowled. Wass was chosen in the thirteen for the First Test against South Africa at Lord's in 1907 but left out of the final eleven.

By Miguel Cabrera. (1763) CastizoPronunciation in Latin American Spanish: is a racial category used in 18th-century Casta paintings of Colonial Spain to refer to people who were three-quarters Spanish by descent and one-quarter Amerindian. The feminine form of the word is castiza. The category was widely recognized by the 18th century in colonial MexicoVinson, Ben III. Before Mestizaje: The Frontiers of Race and Caste in Colonial Mexico. New York: Cambridge University Press 2018, p. 134. and was a standard category portrayed in eighteenth- century casta paintings.  History In the taxonomic chart accompanying a work on casta paintings, castizo is given as \\"uncertain origin\\". It appears in 1543 with the meaning \\"class, condition, social position\\" (calidad, clase o condici√≥n).Garc√≠a S√°iz, Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n. Las Castas Mexicanas: Un G√©nero Pict√≥rico Americano. Milan: Olivetti 1989, pp. 24-25. The term castizo applied to the offspring of a union of a Spaniard and a mestiza (offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian woman); that is, someone who is of three-quarters Spanish and one-quarter Amerindian ancestry. During this era, various other terms (mestizo, cuarter√≥n de indio, etc.) were also used. The word cuarter√≥n usually denotes someone whose racial origin is three- quarters White and one-quarter Black, but sometimes it refers to a castizo, especially in Caribbean South America. Most scholars do not view the racial labels and hierarchical ordering as a rigid or official \\"system of castes,\\" since there was considerable fluidity in the designations. Individuals might be classified or identify themselves with different categories at different points in their lives. Sometimes different labels were used simultaneously in the same documentation. Castizo was a category used in colonial Mexico. According to US scholar Ben Vinson, American-born Spaniards considered light- skinned Moriscas desirable marriage partners. Marriage licenses required a declaration of racial status for each partner. The category castizo \\"was widely recognized by the eighteenth century; castizos still did not appear in great numbers [in parish documentation] even though they were widely distributed throughout New Spain.\\" It was also used in colonial era Guatemala.Vinson, Ben III. (2018) Before Mestizaje, pp. 134, 45. In colonial censuses, officials sought to keep track of certain categories, particularly where a person could claim to be a Spaniard. \\"In the [colonial Mexican] censuses of white/mestizo households, provisions were made to keep accurate records of castizos. The flexibility of having three categories (mestizo, castizo, and espa√±ol) provided census takers a broader framework within which to capture differences of phenotype ‚Äî presumably in hopes of closely regulating entry into the coveted espa√±ol caste.\\" Some were classified as castizos rather than espa√±oles, but \\"their castizo status allowed them to maintain social elevation with the broader mestizo mainstream.\\"Vinson (2018), Before Mestizaje, p. 120. The child of a Spaniard (left) and a castiza woman is considered a Spaniard. (1799) An eighteenth-century visitor to colonial Mexico published the following observation about race mixture between Spaniards and Amerindians: > \\"If the mixed-blood is the offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian, the stigma > [of race mixture] disappears at the third step in descent because it is held > as systematic that a Spaniard and an Indian produce a mestizo; a mestizo and > a Spaniard, a castizo; and a castizo and a Spaniard, a Spaniard.

Ports within a single switch can be partitioned into multiple VSANs, despite sharing hardware resources. Conversely, multiple switches can join a number of ports to form a single VSAN. Cisco Systems designed VSANs modelled after the virtual local area network (VLAN) concept in Ethernet networking, but applying the idea to a storage area network. In October 2004 the Technical Committee T11 of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards approved VSAN technology as a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). A VSAN, like each Fibre Channel (FC) fabric, can offer different high-level protocols such as FCP, FCIP, FICON, iSCSI. Each VSAN is a separate self-contained fabric using distinctive security policies, zones, events, memberships, and name services. Traffic is also separate. Unlike a typical fabric that is resized switch-by-switch, a VSAN can be resized port-by-port. The use of VSANs allows the isolation of traffic within specific portions of the network. If a problem occurs in one VSAN, that problem can be handled with a minimum of disruption to the rest of the network. VSANs can also be configured separately and independently.

Biography Huang was a native of Yuyao in Zhejiang province. He was the son of Huang Zunsu, an official of the Ming court and an adherent of the Donglin Movement who died in prison after opposing the powerful eunuch Wei Zhongxian. Huang Zongxi became a licentiate in 1623 at the age of 14,All ages given here are in East Asian age reckoning. and in the same year followed his father to Beijing, where his father held a post as a censor. The struggle between the Donglin faction and the eunuchs was reaching a climax during this period, and as a result the elder Huang was dismissed from office in 1625 and the two returned home. Soon after, Huang Zongxi was married to Ye Baolin. When Huang Zunsu was traveling in custody to Beijing in 1626, he introduced his son to Liu Zongzhou, a noted philosopher of the Wang Yangming school. Huang Zongxi then became a devoted disciple of Liu and a proponent of the Wang Yangming school. Huang Zunsu was put to death in 1626. When a new emperor ascended the throne two years later, Huang Zongxi set off for the capital to protest the execution of his father. Even before he arrived, however, the eunuch faction was destroyed and those who died under it were bestowed with honors. Still, Huang engaged in daring acts of vengeance in the capital, gaining the respect of many. In accordance with his father's last wishes, he in 1631 devoted himself to studying Chinese history. In 1633, Huang completed the Shilu, or \\"Veritable Records\\" of the first thirteen reigns of the Ming dynasty. After the beginning of the Qing dynasty and the rise to power of Ruan Dacheng, arrest warrants were issued for descendants of Donglin members, including Huang Zongxi. Liang Qichao later speculated that Huang avoided capture by fleeing to Japan during this period, but the evidence consists of only one poem. Huang assisted Ming loyalist forces until his retirement in 1649. Thereafter, Huang devoted himself to study and lived near his native home for much of the rest of his life. He died in 1695, at the age of 84.Hummel (1943) pp. 351‚Äì53. Study Huang was notable for being one of the first Neo- Confucians to stress the need for constitutional law. He also openly advocated the belief that ministers should be openly critical of their emperor; and that rulers held a responsibility to their country. Moreover, an emperor should respect the concerns of his prime minister and head of the Imperial College. In local areas, the local gentry, scholars, and students should gather and form an assembly to discuss issues openly with local magistrates and officials. Huang's first work was not completed until the age of 52, and the work's fuller impact was not felt until the declining years of the Qing dynasty. Major works =Waiting for the Dawn= Waiting for the Dawn (Mingyi daifanglu, ) was a summary of ideas about political reform that had been advanced by various scholars since the reign of Wanli (1573‚Äì1619). The political tract begins with a condemnation of selfish autocratic rule, and declares that the world should belong to the people. The third and fifth section of the work, \\"On Laws\\" and \\"Schools\\", respectively, are particularly famous. In the former, Huang declares that all laws and regulatory bodies should be an outgrowth of local needs, not imposed by leaders with a political agenda. In the latter, he advocates using the education system as a semiofficial forum for educated opinion on public affairs. In the sixth and seventh sections of the work, entitled \\"Selecting Good Men\\", Huang also lays out his ideas for reform of the Imperial examination system. In later sections, he discusses equitable distribution of landholdings, the division between men of civil and military background, fiscal reform, and the problem of Eunuch power during the Ming dynasty.Struve (1988) pp. 476‚Äì78. =Record of the Ming Scholars= The Record of the Ming Scholars () is a systematic survey of all of the important schools of thought that arose during the Ming Dynasty.

Fields moved to Deadwood around 1876 to seek his fortune. He claimed to have been a General in the Union Army during the American Civil War; however, this was false. Career Fields went by several nicknames‚Äîincluding \\"Hoe General\\" and \\"General Darkey\\"but was commonly known as \\"General Fields\\". The man easily deflected any racial epithets and regardless of his personal wealth at any moment, referred to himself as a \\"sly-coon\\". In Deadwood, African Americans were even more of a minority than the Chinese, and Fields was quick to speak out at the many \\"Colored Citizens Meetings,\\" as well as city political gatherings. An eloquent speaker, he soon earned yet another nickname ‚Äì the \\"Shakespearian Darkey.\\" So \\"entertaining\\" was Fields, that the local papers often took his words out of context to provide even better stories for their readers. Such was the case when Fields correctly identified a tornado that touched down in Deadwood Gulch as a cyclone in June, 1881. Reporting on his statement, the Deadwood Times snidely referred to it as a \\"Sly-Coon,\\" which added that nickname to Samuel's already growing list of monikers. While sometimes the newspapers reported legitimate news about Fields, it was often such trivial events such as \\"The Shakespearian Darkey attacked by snow balls\\" and \\"Wonder what bar the darkey cleaned up this morning?\\" The quick talking man seemed to be everywhere in Deadwood and in April, 1878 he was arrested as a murder accomplice when Bill Gay shot and killed a man named Lloyd Forbes who was having an affair with his wife. According to the tale, Fields had carried a note between the lovers, when Bill Gay intercepted it. Gay, who was a leading citizen in Deadwood and after whom the adjacent camp of Gayville was named, defended himself on the basis that the killing was an accident. Gay argued that he only meant to pistol whip Forbes and the gun had gone off by accident. Fields was arrested on the same day as Gay and was kept in the jail for several weeks, mostly for his own protection. Though Fields soon went free, Bill Gay was found guilty of second degree murder and sent to prison. Though Fields had been vindicated, there were many of those in camp who believed that he should be made to leave. In July, the \\"General\\" was arrested for stealing from \\"Lola's Place\\", and his bad luck continued when Deadwood's first public school teacher was murdered in her sleep in August. It seems that Fields was either constantly in the wrong place at the wrong time, or had become the focus of blame for any evil that was taking place in the camp. Almost immediately after Minnie Callison had been found murdered, rumors began to circulate that the \\"General\\" had been seen outside her room that same night. To further complicate matters, Officer Siver found footprints in her yard that were the same size as Fields. Minnie's husband, John Callison, was convinced that Fields was her murderer. On August 20, 1878, Samuel was arrested, and though he was later released, it was yet another cloud that continued to hang over his head. Then, in December, 1878, the papers reported that Fields had prevented a woman named Annie Simms from committing suicide, so it seems it wasn't all mischief that the papers were reporting on. In 1879, Fields' name was submitted for the position of Justice in Deadwood and by November he was once again practicing his \\"Shakespearian\\" oratory skills on soap boxes. But the camp hadn't forgotten his alleged \\"criminal\\" past and he was egged by the audience. Though he didn't win the election, it didn't curb his political ambitions. In 1883, he was working to fill the vacant position of coroner and did in fact temporarily fill the position. During Fields' time in Deadwood, he was known to have worked at the Merchants, Wentworth, and International Hotels as a porter and as a waiter. By 1889, he had moved on to Omaha, Nebraska, but a year later, he was again back in South Dakota, working as a bellhop in Rapid City. Afterwards, his whereabouts are lost to history. Samuel Fields's exploits were common fodder in local newspapers, such as the Black Hills Pioneer. In popular culture Fields was portrayed by Franklyn Ajaye in the HBO series Deadwood and in 2019's Deadwood: The Movie.

Typical examples include operation below the maximum power rating, current rating, or voltage rating. In electronics Derating curve of a hypothetical power device. Power semiconductor devices have a maximum power dissipation rating usually quoted at a case temperature of . The datasheet for the device also includes a derating curve which indicates how much a device will dissipate without getting damaged at any given case temperature and this must be taken into account while designing a system. As can be seen from the derating curve image for a hypothetical bipolar junction transistor, the device (rated for 100 W at ) cannot be expected to dissipate anything more than about 40 W if the ambient temperature is such that the temperature at which the device's case will stabilise (after heat-sinking) is . This final case temperature is a function of the thermal resistance between the device's case and the heat- sink; and the heat-sink and the ambient (this includes the heat-sink's temp/watt rating - with lower values implying better cooling characteristics). Some capacitors' voltage capability is reduced at higher temperatures because the softened dielectric (e.g., a polymer) is softened further by the heat and its breakdown field strength is reduced. Derating curves are included in data sheets for such capacitors. Derating can also be used to provide a safety margin for transient voltages or currents (spikes) that exceed normal operation, or simply to prolong life. For example the life of electrolytic capacitors is dramatically increased by operating them below their maximum temperature rating. In electrical installations All dimmers rely on heat conduction and convection to keep the electronic components cool. Similarly, power wiring (e.g., house wiring) not surrounded by an air space (e.g., inside a conduit) needs to have its current-limiting device (e.g. circuit breaker or fuse) adjusted so as not to carry as much current through that circuit. Derating is the reduction of the maximum capacity (load) a unit can reliably handle when fins/side sections are removed.

The mountain or its locality is believed to be the birthplace of Genghis Khan as well as his tomb. It is also the birthplace of one of his most successful generals, Subutai. The mountain is part of the Khan Khentii Strictly Protected Area established in 1992. It had strong religious significance before Genghis Khan made it a powerful landmark and is considered the most sacred mountain in Mongolia since it was designated as sacred by Genghis Khan. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 4 July 2015 under the title \\"Great Burkhan Khaldun Mountain and its surrounding sacred landscape.\\" Under a Presidential Decree of 1955 the worship of this mountain has been formalised and the mountain declared a national monument. Its ecosystem is complex with unique biodiversity with flora of the Central Asian steppe. It has 50 species of fauna and 253 species of birds. Location Burkhan Khaldun is in the northeast of Mongolia in the middle of the Khentii mountain range. The mountain is integral to the Khan Khentii Strictly Protected Area established in 1992 and which extends over an area of . Geography Burkhan Khaldun means the \\"God Mountain\\" and is also called Khentii Khan (The King of the Khentii Mountain range). It is one of the Khentii Mountains in the Khentii Province of northeastern Mongolia. It is the highest mountain of the region, rising to an elevation of , and is crescent-shaped. It is the source of several rivers: the Onon and Kherlen rivers flow into the Amur, which has its outfall in the Pacific Ocean; and the rivers Tuul, Kharaa and Yeruu flow northwards to join the Selenge, which empties into the Arctic Ocean. It is in a complex ecosystem with unique biodiversity which is defined as a \\"transition zone from Siberian permafrost land forms to great steppe\\". History Genghis Khan (also known as Chinggis Khan) lost his battle against the Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking protection in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to the spirits of the mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and then put it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods. He took off his hat, crossed his hand across his chest and knelt in obeisance nine times offering worship to the sun and the mountain. He spent three days on the mountain offering prayers and thus established a strong bond of spirituality with the mountain and derived special strength from it. In the Secret History of the Mongols, Genghis Khan, who later became the \\"World Conqueror\\" believing in his own destiny, said: Genghis Khan then started his campaign to unify the land and people of Mongolia as a strong force. He gave the Burkhan Khaldun the status of a royal sacred mountain. The history is chronicled in the Secret History of the Mongols, which UNESCO recognised in 1990 as a \\"literary creation of outstanding universal significance\\". In this document Burkhan Khaldun is described in detail and mentioned 27 times, which signifies the unique position of the mountain in Mongolia‚Äòs heritage. This document establishes the authenticity of the site, stating: A Presidential Decree of 1955 formalised the worship of the Burkhan Khaldun Mountain as a national monument. Special worship is offered to the mountain according to a prescribed procedure at the main \\"Ovoo of the Heaven\\"; it is reserved for a few officials of the state and local administration, shamans and a few Buddhist lamas (monks). World Heritage status Burkhan Khaldun was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site at the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee on 4 July 2015 under the title \\"Great Burkhan Khaldun Mountain and its surrounding sacred landscape\\", covering an area of and an additional buffer zone of , categorised under Criterion (iv) for its unique cultural tradition of mountain and nature worship of past several millennium, and (vi) for its universally known historical and literary epic of immense importance. Religious significance An ovoo. Burkhan Khaldun has a spiritual significance unmatched by any other mountain in Mongolia and is given the symbolic status of the ‚Äúcradle‚Äù of Mongolia's nationhood fully representing the \\"heritage and traditional ways of life of nomadic people of Mongolia\\". The (unconfirmed) Mongolian belief that Genghis Khan was born here and is buried somewhere in this mountain has added to its sanctity, particularly since Khan offered worship here and declared the mountain as the most sacred in the country. It has given authenticity to the spiritual nature of the mountain. As a result, regular pilgrimage is undertaken by the people to the three sacred major ovoos or stone cairns at the sacred sites along a specified route where Mongolian shamanic worship is offered. The specified route is unique and covers: Main Ovoo of Heaven at the pinnacle of the mountain via Gurvan Khoriud (\\"Three Forbidden Precincts\\"); the Uud Mod (\\"Two Trees of Entrance\\"); the Bosgo Tengeriin Davaa (\\"Threshold Pass of Heaven\\"); the catchment of the Kherlen River and the Sacred Bogd Rivers; and finally to the Beliin (\\"Lowest\\") ovoo. Flora The flora found in the mountain belongs to the Central Asian steppe and consists of coniferous forests of the taiga. The plant species reported are 28 listed in the Mongolian Red Book, 15 very rare species, and 28 species listed as rare species. The species listed in the IUCN Red List are found here: two critically endangered species, four endangered species, and eight vulnerable species. Fauna In the faunal geographical province of the Burkhan Khaldun Mountain in the Khentii district the fauna reported are more than \\"50 species of 27 genera of six orders including five species of mammals/insectivores, 4 species of hymenoptera, four species of lagomorpha, 19 species of rodents, 13 species of predators, five species of ungulate, one species of reptile, and 253 species of birds\\". According to the Mongolian Red Data Book the very rare mammal species are musk deer (Moshus moshiferus) and moose (Alces alces); the very rare bird species are the Siberian white crane (Grus luecogeranus), Greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), Pallas‚Äôs fish eagle (Haliaeetus leucoryphus), white-naped crane (Grus vipio) and hooded crane (Grus monacha); the fish species is the Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii).

Most countries require licensed telecommunications operators to provide their networks with Legal Interception gateways and nodes for the interception of communications. The interfaces of these gateways have been standardized by telecommunication standardization organizations. With the legacy public switched telephone network (PSTN), wireless, and cable systems, lawful interception (LI) was generally performed by accessing the mechanical or digital switches supporting the targets' calls. The introduction of packet switched networks, softswitch technology, and server-based applications the past two decades fundamentally altered how LI is undertaken. Lawful interception differs from the dragnet-type mass surveillance sometimes done by intelligence agencies, where all data passing a fiber-optic splice or other collection point is extracted for storage or filtering. It is also separate from the data retention of metadata that has become a legal requirement in some jurisdictions.  Terminology  Lawful interception is obtaining communications network data pursuant to lawful authority for the purpose of analysis or evidence. Such data generally consist of signalling or network management information or, in fewer instances, the content of the communications. If the data are not obtained in real-time, the activity is referred to as access to retained data (RD). There are many bases for this activity that include infrastructure protection and cybersecurity. In general, the operator of public network infrastructure can undertake LI activities for those purposes. Operators of private network infrastructures in the United States have an inherent right to maintain LI capabilities within their own networks unless otherwise prohibited. One of the bases for LI is the interception of telecommunications by law enforcement agencies (LEAs), regulatory or administrative agencies, and intelligence services, in accordance with local law. Under some legal systems, implementations‚Äîparticularly real-time access to content‚Äîmay require due process and receiving proper authorization from competent authorities‚Äîan activity that was formerly known as \\"wiretapping\\" and has existed since the inception of electronic communications. The material below primarily treats this narrow segment of LI. Technical description Almost all countries have lawful interception capability requirements and have implemented them using global LI requirements and standards developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), or CableLabs organizations‚Äîfor wireline/Internet, wireless, and cable systems, respectively. In the USA, the comparable requirements are enabled by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), with the specific capabilities promulgated jointly by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice. In the USA, lawful intercept technology is currently patented by a company named Voip-pal.com under the USPTO Publication #: 20100150138. Governments require phone service providers to install a legal interception gateway (LIG), along legal interception nodes (LIN), which allow them to intercept in real-time the phone calls, SMS messages, emails and some file transfers or instant messages. These LI measures for governmental surveillance have been in place since the beginning of digital telephony. To prevent investigations' being compromised, LI systems may be designed in a manner that hides the interception from the telecommunications operator concerned. This is a requirement in some jurisdictions. To ensure systematic procedures for carrying out interception, while also lowering the costs of interception solutions, industry groups and government agencies worldwide have attempted to standardize the technical processes behind lawful interception. One organization, ETSI, has been a major driver in lawful interception standards not only for Europe, but worldwide. This architecture attempts to define a systematic and extensible means by which network operators and law enforcement agents (LEAs) can interact, especially as networks grow in sophistication and scope of services. Note this architecture applies to not only ‚Äútraditional‚Äù wireline and wireless voice calls, but to IP-based services such as voice over IP, email, instant messaging, etc. The architecture is now applied worldwide (in some cases with slight variations in terminology), including in the United States in the context of CALEA conformance. Three stages are called for in the architecture: # collection where target-related ‚Äúcall‚Äù data and content are extracted from the network # mediation where the data is formatted to conform to specific standards # delivery of the data and content to the law enforcement agency (LEA). The call data (known as intercept related information (IRI) in Europe and call data (CD) in the US) consists of information about the targeted communications, including destination of a voice call (e.g., called party‚Äôs telephone number), source of a call (caller‚Äôs phone number), time of the call, duration, etc. Call content is namely the stream of data carrying the call. Included in the architecture is the lawful interception management function, which covers interception session set-up and tear-down, scheduling, target identification, etc. Communications between the network operator and LEA are via the handover interfaces (HI). Communications data and content are typically delivered from the network operator to the LEA in an encrypted format over an IP-based VPN. The interception of traditional voice calls still often relies on the establishment of an ISDN channel that is set up at the time of the interception. As stated above, the ETSI architecture is equally applicable to IP-based services where IRI/CD is dependent on parameters associated with the traffic from a given application to be intercepted. For example, in the case of email IRI would be similar to the header information on an email message (e.g., destination email address, source email address, time email was transmitted) as well as pertinent header information within the IP packets conveying the message (e.g., source IP address of email server originating the email message). Of course, more in-depth information would be obtained by the interception system so as to avoid the usual email address spoofing that often takes place (e.g., spoofing of source address). Voice- over-IP likewise has its own IRI, including data derived from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that are used to set up and tear down a VOIP call. ETSI LI Technical Committee work today is primarily focussed on developing the new Retained Data Handover and next-generation network specifications, as well as perfecting the innovative TS102232 standards suite that apply to most contemporary network uses. USA interception standards that help network operators and service providers conform to CALEA are mainly those specified by the Federal Communications Commission (which has both plenary legislative and review authority under CALEA), CableLabs, and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS). ATIS's standards include new standards for broadband Internet access and VoIP services, as well as legacy J-STD-025B, which updates the earlier J-STD-025A to include packetized voice and CDMA wireless interception. To ensure the quality of evidence, the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) has outlined standards for electronic surveillance once a Title III surveillance application is approved: # Ensure clear access to all data without any loss of information or impact on the network being monitored # Create a filter to adhere to warrant parameters ‚Äì time span, types of communications that can be monitored, evidence to be collected, etc. # Set the lawful intercept device to capture and/or store data according to the warrant parameters. # Deliver data directly from the source to the mediation device without any human intervention or packet loss Generic global standards have also been developed by Cisco via the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that provide a front- end means of supporting most LI real-time handover standards. All of these standards have been challenged as \\"deficient\\" by the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to CALEA. Laws The principal global treaty-based legal instrument relating to LI (including retained data) is the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, 23 Nov 2001). The secretariat for the Convention is the Council of Europe. However, the treaty itself has signatories worldwide and provides a global scope. Individual countries have different legal requirements relating to lawful interception. The Global Lawful Interception Industry Forum lists many of these, as does the Council of Europe secretariat. For example, in the United Kingdom the law is known as RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act), in the United States there is an array of federal and state criminal law, in Commonwealth of Independent States countries as SORM. =Europe= In the European Union, the European Council Resolution of 17 January 1995 on the Lawful Interception of Telecommunications (Official Journal C 329) mandated similar measures to CALEA on a pan-European basis. Although some EU member countries reluctantly accepted this resolution out of privacy concerns (which are more pronounced in Europe than the US), there appears now to be general agreement with the resolution. Interception mandates in Europe are generally more rigorous than those of the US; for example, both voice and ISP public network operators in the Netherlands have been required to support interception capabilities for years. In addition, publicly available statistics indicate that the number of interceptions in Europe exceed by many hundreds of times those undertaken in the U.S. Europe continues to maintain its global leadership role in this sector through the adoption by the European Parliament and Council in 2006 of the far reaching Data Retention Directive. The provisions of the Directive apply broadly to almost all public electronic communications and require the capture of most related information, including location, for every communication. The information must be stored for a period of at least six months, up to two years, and made available to law enforcement upon lawful request. The Directive has been widely emulated in other countries. On 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the Directive 2006/24/EC invalid for violating fundamental rights. =United States of America= In the United States, three Federal statutes authorize lawful interception. The 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, Title III pertains mainly to lawful interception criminal investigations. The second law, the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, as amended by the Patriot Act, governs wiretapping for intelligence purposes where the subject of the investigation must be a foreign (non-US) national or a person working as an agent on behalf of a foreign country. The Administrator of the U.S. Courts annual reports indicate that the federal cases are related to illegal drug distribution, with cell phones as the dominant form of intercepted communication. During the 1990s, as in most countries, to help law enforcement and the FBI more effectively carry out wiretap operations, especially in view of the emerging digital voice and wireless networks at the time, the U.S. Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994. This act provides the Federal statutory framework for network operator assistance to LEAs in providing evidence and tactical information. In 2005, CALEA was applied to public broadband networks Internet access and Voice over IP services that are interconnected to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). In the 2000s, surveillance focus turned to terrorism. NSA warrantless surveillance outside the supervision of the FISA court caused considerable controversy. It was revealed in 2013 mass surveillance disclosures that since 2007, the National Security Administration has been collecting connection metadata for all calls in the United States under the authority of section 215 PATRIOT Act, with the mandatory cooperation of phone companies and with the approval of the FISA court and briefings to Congress. The government claims it does not access the information in its own database on contacts between American citizens without a warrant. Lawful interception can also be authorized under local laws for state and local police investigations. = Canada = Police ability to lawfully intercept private communications is governed by Part VI of the Criminal Code of Canada (Invasion Of Privacy). When evaluating Canada‚Äôs position on lawful interception, Canadian courts have issued two major rulings on this issue. In June 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers need a search warrant before accessing information from internet service providers about users‚Äô identities. The context behind this 8-0 ruling is an adolescent Saskatchewan man charged with possessing and distributing child pornography. The police used the man‚Äôs IP address to access his personal information from his online service provider‚Äî all of which was done without a search warrant. The plaintiff‚Äôs attorneys argued that their client‚Äôs rights were violated, as he was victim to unlawful search and seizure. Despite the court‚Äôs ruling, the evidence gathered from the unwarranted search was used as evidence in trial, as the court claimed that the police were acting in good faith. In accordance to the ruling, the court proclaims that a warrant is not needed if: # ‚ÄúThere are exigent circumstances, such as where the information is required to prevent imminent bodily harm.‚Äù # ‚ÄúIf there is a reasonable law authorizing access.‚Äù # ‚ÄúIf the information being sought does not raise a reasonable expectation of privacy.‚Äù The second court case to refer to is from the same year but in December. Essentially, the Supreme Court of Canada argued that police are allowed access to a suspect‚Äôs cell phone, but they must abide by very strict guidelines. This ruling came about from the argument of Kevin Fearon who was convicted of armed robbery in 2009. After robbing a Toronto Jewelry kiosk, Fearon argued that the police unlawfully violated his charter rights upon searching his cellphone without a warrant. Although divided, the Supreme Court laid out very detailed criteria for law enforcement officers to follow when searching a suspect's phone without a warrant. There are four rules which officers must follow in these instances: # ‚ÄúThe arrest must be lawful ‚Äì This is the case for any situation; it just means if the arrest isn‚Äôt lawful, then neither is the search.‚Äù # ‚ÄúThe search must be incidental to the arrest and police need an ‚Äúobjectively reasonable‚Äù reason to conduct the search. These include: protecting police/the accused/the public; preserving evidence; discovering evidence such as finding more suspects.‚Äù # ‚ÄúThe nature and extent of the search are tailored to the purpose of the search. This means police activity on the phone must be directly linked to the purpose they give.‚Äù # ‚ÄúPolice must take detailed notes of what they looked at on the device as well as how it was searched (e.g. which applications or programs they looked at, the extent of search, the time of search, its purpose and duration)‚Äù To continue a search without a warrant, the situation at-hand would need to meet three of the four guidelines stated above. Nonetheless, the court highly encourages law enforcement to request a warrant before searching a cellphone to promote and protect privacy in Canada. = Russia = Due to Yarovaya Law, law enforcement is entitled to stored private communication data. =Elsewhere= Most countries worldwide maintain LI requirements similar to those Europe and the U.S., and have moved to the ETSI handover standards. The Convention on Cybercrime requires such capabilities. Illegal use As with many law enforcement tools, LI systems may be subverted for illicit purposes, producing a violation of human rights, as declared by European Court of Human Rights in the case Bettino Craxi III v. ItalyThe deviant behaviors (...) were ignored as useful to prepare the public to an anticipated judgment incriminating: . It also occurred in Greece during the 2004 Olympics: the telephone operator Vodafone Greece was fined $100,000,000 in 2006 (or ‚Ç¨76,000,000) for failing to secure its systems against unlawful access.

It is planted in the approximate form of a cathedral, with grass avenues for nave, chancel, transepts, chapels and cloisters and \\"walls\\" of different species of trees. The tree cathedral was planned by Edmond Blyth in the 1930s as an act of \\"Faith, hope and reconciliation\\" in response to his memories of World War I. As a cadet at Sandhurst in 1916 Blyth had made close friends called Arthur Bailey, John Bennett and Francis Holland who were all killed prior to the end of the war. In 1930 he paid a visit to Liverpool Cathedral, which was then under construction. Blyth wrote: \\"As we drove south through the Cotswold hills on our way home... I saw the evening sun light up a coppice of trees on the side of a hill. It occurred to me then that here was something more beautiful still and the idea formed of building a cathedral with trees.\\" Work began in 1932 and continued in stages. The site became overgrown during World War II, but development recommenced after the end of the war. The first religious service at the site was held in 1953, and services continue to this day. The outer \\"wall\\" of the cathedral In 1960 the Tree Cathedral was accepted as a gift by the National Trust. The independent Whipsnade Tree Cathedral Fund is responsible for the religious use of the site. Services have been conducted by many different denominations. It is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The Tree Cathedral contains chapels meant for each of the four seasons.

Part of the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, it is bordered by the suburbs of Rosewater, Queenstown, Cheltenham and Port Adelaide.  History  Alberton, like Port Adelaide, is rich in historical significance. On 7 March 1839, the South Australian Company was granted private subdivision of preliminary section 423. Section 423 was sold as 'The Town of Albert' and subsequently became 'Albert Town' after Prince Albert, Prince Consort of Queen Victoria. Eventually, 'Alberton' became commonly used and around the turn of the century was officially adopted as the suburb's name. With demand for workers at the Port and homes for these workers needed, late in 1840 there were already 61 houses and 235 residents in Alberton. The layout of 'Albert Town' originally had provisions for four public squares, two of which still exist. St Georges' Square became the site for the Anglican Church while St Andrew's Square was later subdivided and became the site of the Trinity Uniting Church. St Patrick's Square and Company Square are today still used as public recreation areas (Couper-Smartt, 2003). Many of the streets in Alberton took the names of the original purchasers while others, such as 'Prince', 'Queen' and 'King' Streets reflect their English heritage. Alberton Post Office opened on 1 January 1855. The District Council of Queenstown and Alberton was established in 1864, bringing dedicated local government to the residents of the two townships either side of the new Port Road. In 1898 this council was absorbed by the Corporate Town of Port Adelaide.  Sport  Alberton is home to Australian rules football team Port Adelaide, who participate in the national Australian Football League (AFL) and the Adelaide-based South Australian National Football League (SANFL). The Alberton Lawn Bowls Club was opened in 1903 at the Alberton Oval as the second oldest lawn bowls club in Adelaide. It leased part of the Alberton Oval from the Port Adelaide Council until 1997 when it became an Underlessee of the Port Adelaide Football Club.  Landmarks  =Alberton Oval= Alberton Oval is located on Queen Street. The ground is used for Australian rules football and cricket and has a capacity of 15,000 people with seated grandstands holding 2,000. Alberton Oval is the training and administration base for the Port Adelaide Football Club. =Alberton Hotel= First licensed in 1848, the Alberton Hotel is one of the oldest hotels in South Australia. For the past 60 years, it has been owned and operated by the Brien family. The old bluestone structure still stands at the same spot on the corner of Port Road and Sussex Street. =Former Alberton Cemetery= Located on Parker Street, the former Alberton Cemetery was opened in 1847 and officially closed in 1874, with the last burial being conducted in 1922. In 1994, the land on which the former cemetery was located was converted into a park by the City of Port Adelaide. Transport TransAdelaide‚Äôs railcars nos. 3109/3110 at Alberton with 13.15 Outer Harbor ‚Äì Adelaide service on 26 May 2005. Alberton railway station was one of the first local stations to open in South Australia. The railway from Adelaide to Port Adelaide was constructed in 1856 and was the first line to be built in South Australia. Alberton was one of the original stops, the others being Woodville and Bowden. The stone and brick building on the Port Adelaide- bound platform is the original station building dating from 1856. There is still a regular train service from Alberton station to Adelaide and Outer Harbor. Unfortunately the ticket office has been closed for the past twenty years and this contributes to the station buildings being a frequent target for vandalism and graffiti. Governance The District Council of Queenstown and Alberton, established in 1864, was the first local government body in Alberton. From 1898 following the annexation of Queenstown and Alberton by Port Adelaide, Alberton was a prominent township at the south eastern end of the Port Adelaide council area. Port Adelaide council merged with Enfield council in 1996 to become the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, which now provides local government to Alberton. Alberton lies in the electoral district of Cheltenham (formerly Price) and within the safe Labor seat of Port Adelaide. Alberton, like much of the greater Port Adelaide area has always been strong Labor Party territory. Both state and federal government representation in Alberton has been dominated by members of the Labor party.

History Although it was not until 1880 that the California State Mining Bureau, predecessor to the California Geological Survey, was established, the \\"roots\\" of California's state geological survey date to an earlier time. As might be expected for a state that owed its existence to the gold rush of 1849, the California State Legislature recognized that geologists could provide valuable information. In 1851, one year after California was admitted to the United States, the Legislature named John B. Trask, a medical practitioner and active member of the California Academy of Sciences, as Honorary State Geologist. In 1853 the Legislature passed a joint resolution asking him for geological information about the state. He submitted a report On the Geology of the Sierra Nevada, or California Range. About two months later, the Legislature created the first California Geological Survey headed by Trask, who retained the title of State Geologist. William H. Brewer's 1864 field party Within a few years the mining of placer gold began to decline and mining of quartz lodes began. These changes, coupled with publication of reports by Trask, created a public clamor for a state geological survey. In 1860 the Legislature passed an act creating the Office of State Geologist and defining the duties thereof. The act named Josiah D. Whitney (for whom Mount Whitney is named) to fill the office. A Yale graduate, Whitney had worked on several surveys in the east. The act directed Whitney to make an accurate and complete geological survey of the state. The Team Whitney chose William Henry Brewer as chief botanist to lead the original field party. Brewer then added Clarence King, James Gardiner, topographer Charles F. Hoffmann and packer Dick Cotter. It was one of the most ambitious geological surveys ever attempted and yielded a vast amount of information about California that was hitherto unknown and unpublished. Among the natural features of California they were the first to describe Kings Canyon, which they discovered in 1864. The original California Geological Survey influenced the future of surveying and spurred the creation of the United States Geological Survey. Funding for the field work was limited and the last field work was done in 1870 by Hoffmann and W. A. Goodyear. In 1874 the Survey was officially ended due to hostility between then Governor of California Newton Booth and Whitney. Later Organizations Drafting Department, 1905 In 1880 the State Mining Bureau was established by the Legislature. The establishment of the Bureau was a direct action in response to the need for information on the occurrence, mining, and processing of gold in the state. Its focus was on California's mining industry and the Governor appointed the State Mineralogist. In 1891, the Bureau published the first geologic map of the state showing eight stratigraphic units in color, along with numerous blank areas where information was lacking. The second colored geologic map of the state, published in 1916, showed 21 stratigraphic units and was accompanied by an explanatory volume (Bulletin 72, Geologic Formations of California). In 1927 the Bureau became the Division of Mines within the Department of Natural Resources. In 1928, with the hiring of the first geologist, the focus of the Division began to shift towards the gathering of basic geologic information. In 1938 a new 1:500,000-scale geologic map was published. During the 1940s and 1950s, the Division developed as a state geological survey and two well- defined branches were established: the Mining Engineering Branch and the Geology Branch. The Division began processing numerous geological quadrangle maps and reports for publication. In 1952 the Division conducted its first public-safety related effort by documenting the impacts of the 1952 Kern County earthquake and its aftershocks. The 1960s were years of development of new programs and modernization of long-standing programs. In 1962, eighty-one years after its creation, the Division of Mines was renamed the Division of Mines and Geology (DMG). Its focus had shifted from an organization that was primarily mine-oriented to one responsible for a broader range of practical applications of geology, especially geologic hazards and seismic hazards. A highlight of the decade was the completion in 1966 of the geologic mapping program. From the early 1970s to the present, Division programs have expanded often due to the passage of legislation. Following earthquakes and landslide damage during the 1970s and 1980s, legislation passed which clearly focused DMG's authority on several fronts, including: *Establishing the Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program to obtain statewide records of the response of rock, soil, and structures to ground motion caused by earthquakes. *Enacting the Alquist Priolo Special Studies Zone Act, mandating the delineation of zones along traces of hazardous faults. *Enacting the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act to ensure that significant mineral deposits are identified and protected and the reclamation of mined lands. *Declaring that the California Department of Conservation is the primary state agency responsible for geologic hazard review and investigation. *Enacting the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, establishing a program to identify and map seismic hazard zones. Language was also added which outlined DMG's responsibilities as encompassing: *Hazard assessment ‚Äì identification and mapping of geologic hazards and estimates of potential consequences and likelihood of occurrence. *Information and advisory services including maintenance of a geologic library, public education program, maintenance of a geologic data base, review functions, and expert consulting to federal, state and local government agencies. *Emergency response including monitoring and assessment of anomalous geologic activity, and operation of a clearinghouse for post-event earth science investigations. *Development and application of mitigation methods, including identifying state research needs, facilitating needed research, and expediting the application of new research results to public policy. Naming history The California Geological Survey has had many names over its history. The original Geological Survey of California was replaced in April 1880 by the new California State Mining Bureau. This was renamed the Division of Mines in 1927. In 1962 the division's name was expanded to be California Division of Mines and Geology, a name that lasted until August 2006, when the state legislature renamed the division the California Geological Survey.

Skill level number one or \\"Z1\\" are two-channel aircraft aimed at first-time flyers who have had little or no experience with radio controlled aircraft and whose operation can be self-taught. The hand-held transmitter controls throttle and rudder only; climb and descent are strictly a function of throttle position. These models incorporate Horizon Hobby's proprietary \\"Smart-Trak\\" mixing system which automatically adds a small amount of \\"up elevator\\" in turns, thus keeping the nose up and avoiding loss of altitude. The Super Cub is the only three-channel \\"Z1\\" aircraft. \\"Z2\\" aircraft are three-channel craft which add the third dimension of controllable pitch and are intended for more experienced pilots, but can be learned by first-time pilots with the assistance of an experienced pilot. \\"Z3\\" aircraft are high-performance three- channel craft and are geared toward intermediate to advanced pilots. Most models regardless of skill level are equipped with the unique \\"X-Port\\" accessory receptacle which allows the addition of accessories such as a \\"bomb\\" drop, parachute drop, high-intensity white LED lighting for night operation, or a sonic pulse \\"gun\\" which allows for air-to-air combat with similarly equipped HobbyZone and ParkZone models. The gun emits a sonic pulse which briefly disables the stricken aircraft's drive motor. Models equipped with the \\"Multi-Mode\\" system can be flown in beginner mode with limited control surface throws and rudder/elevator mixing or \\"sport\\" mode which allows full control surface throw. Some HobbyZone produces include the patented Anti-Crash Technology which utilizes special optical sensors that detect both sky and ground. Should the plane enter a dive, the system automatically applies counter-control to reduce the likelihood of a crash. It also detects and avoids overcompensation of the controls, one of the leading causes of crashes by inexperienced pilots. As skills develop, the ACT is easily disabled by pulling the throttle stick downward and holding it for three seconds. The plane beeps twice to signify the ACT is turned off. Rearming the ACT is accomplished in the same manner and will cause the plane to beep once. Arming and disarming the ACT can be done in flight if desired. The second plane to incorporate ACT is the three-channel Firebird Freedom which features a two- piece wing with larger surfaces, a much more powerful 480-series motor with seven-cell power, and steel pushrods to manipulate the control surfaces. HobbyZone introduced their first scale model in 2006. The three-channel, 480-powered Super Cub RTF incorporates ACT technology for novice pilots in a larger, more powerful package than ParkZone's intermediate J-3 Cub.

Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat. Music John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed Q and Not U in the summer of 1998 and began playing shows in the D.C. area later that November. They released their first album, No Kill No Beep Beep, in late 2000. It was marked by strongly rhythmic compositions with dissonant guitar and bass, though each song was built around unique melodies and danceable beats that cut through and rode on top of the swells of noise. Several reviewers described the music as \\"catchy\\", and this quality of oblique yet upbeat and endearing musicality would be a trademark of the band's future work, setting them apart from their aurally less forgiving D.C. hardcore peers and bringing them more into line with the budding dance-punk scene.Review of \\"Power\\" at Crawdaddy! Following extensive touring in 2000 and 2001, alongside bands like Engine Down, Milemarker, Ted Leo and The Pharmacists, and El Guapo, bassist Borlik was dismissed in November 2001. His absence prompted a more slimmed-down sound as reflected in 2002's Different Damage. Guitarist Richards occasionally took a turn on bass guitar or keyboard and Klahr also incorporated keyboards, as well as a baritone guitar, though they left bass instruments out of some songs altogether, and the album is instead driven by ever-more complex and propulsive dance beats, razor sharp guitar licks (\\"So Many Animal Calls\\", \\"When the Lines Go Down\\"), and pronounced use of multiple overlapping vocals from each member of the band (\\"Snow Patterns\\", \\"No Damage Nocturne\\"). The album also expanded upon the small patches of hushed tapping cultivated on No Kill... (\\"We Heart Our Hive\\") into fully grown bodies of delicate rhythm (\\"Soft Pyramids\\"). The band toured extensively following the release, making their way through the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Japan. While Different Damage pulled a lot of sound out of very little equipment, the band put together Power (2004) using a greater variety of instruments, most notably synths, melodicas and recorders and integrated these new sounds into more delicate, multi-faceted, and ever-more variegated songs. The use of guttural and aggressive bass synth rafts on \\"Wonderful People\\" and other songs is especially prominent and adds greater depth to the songs, as well as giving heightened value to the bass-less, jangly interludes throughout the album. The tensed and urgent vocal delivery that had been part of each previous release was also pushed to new limits, now developing into falsetto (\\"Throw Back Your Head\\") and startling choral arrangements (\\"District Night Prayer\\") that had been previously unexplored. Miscellaneous details Q and Not U released very little non-album material; all of the band's songs have been included on one of their three LPs, except for three tracks: \\"Busy Lights, Busy Carpet,\\" from their debut single, 'Hot and Informed', \\"Ten Thousand Animal Calls,\\" from On Play Patterns, and a cover of Neil Young's \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\" from the compilation Don't Know When I'll Be Back Again. \\"You Did It Electric\\" is an unreleased song often played live in early shows. *On Play Patterns and the Book of Flags/X-Polynation single contain different recordings of tracks that also appeared on full-lengths. \\"After seven years, hundreds of shows, thousands of miles, 46 states, four continents, three albums, only one flat- tire and countless nicknames for Shawn Brackbill, Q and Not U is disbanding,\\" wrote band member Chris Richards. \\"With all of your support, we feel that we've reached all of our shared goals as Q and Not U and we're ready to move on to other projects in life. We all hope to play music together again someday, but we feel that it's a beautiful and natural time to bring this band to a close.\\" Final band members Harris Klahr ‚Äì guitar, vocals, synths, etc. * Christopher Richards ‚Äì guitar, vocals, synths, etc. * John Davis ‚Äì drums, percussion, vocals, etc. In 2009, Richards was named Pop Critic for The Washington Post.

It is based in London and had offices in Chicago (closed November 2008), Le Havre (closed July 2009), and Berlin (closed December 2008). History Southern was originally a recording studio owned and operated by John Loder. Loder became friends with musician, author and poet Penny Rimbaud and collaborated with him and others in an experimental progressive band called EXIT. Rimbaud later formed anarchist punk band Crass, and Southern Studios and John Loder were the obvious choice of venue for the recording of their first album The Feeding of the 5000, originally released on Small Wonder Records. When Small Wonder encountered problems manufacturing the release, due to the allegedly blasphemous nature of some of the lyrics, Crass determined they would need to start their own label to take full responsibility and control of their output. Loder facilitated this by acting as the business manager behind Crass Records: arranging manufacture, distribution and accounting. The success of Crass and their label thrust Loder into the emerging international independent record business, as he formed alliances with small distributors around the world to distribute the band's output. Through this work he came into contact with a handful of like-minded bands and labels that inspired his passion in a similar way as Crass. He in particular formed a lasting partnership with Dischord Records, helping them to release the Minor Threat records in Europe by pressing and distributing them on their own Dischord imprint. The first release on the Southern Records label (not to be confused with Loder's Southern Studios, the recording studio and distributor) was Babes in Toyland's album Fontanelle, in August 1992. Other label imprints operated by Southern include Black Diamond, Latitudes and Truth Cult. Southern closed its US distribution and label offices in November 2008 and moved all operations to London.

Originally an iron and coal mining project under joint Japanese and Chinese control, the mine came under predominately Japanese control. In the early 1930s, Japan invaded the northeast of China, and Liaoning province became part of the Japanese-controlled puppet state of Manchukuo. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese forced Chinese labourers‚Äîsome of whom had been captured from local military organizations‚Äîto work the colliery under very poor conditions. Food was scarce and workers did not have sufficient clothing. Working conditions were harsh, and diseases such as typhoid and cholera flourished due to poor sanitation and water supplies. Typically miners worked 12-hour shifts or longer. The Japanese controllers were known to beat workers with pick handles, and the perimeter of the mine was fenced and guarded. Many describe the conditions as slave labour. Coal dust explosion On April 26, 1942, a gas and coal-dust explosion in the mine sent flames bursting from the mine shaft entrance. Miners' relatives rushed to the site but were denied entry by a cordon of Japanese guards, who erected electric fences to keep them out. In an attempt to curtail the fire underground, the Japanese shut off the ventilation and sealed the pit head. Witnesses say that the Japanese did not evacuate the pit fully before sealing it, trapping many Chinese workers underground to suffocate in the smoke. The Soviet Union later investigated and blamed the actions of the Japanese for needlessly increasing the death toll. It took workers ten days to remove all the corpses and rubble from the shaft. The dead were buried in a mass grave nearby. Many victims could not be properly identified due to the extent of the burns. The Japanese at first reported the death toll to be 34. Initial newspaper reports were short, as few as 40 words, and downplayed the scale of the disaster, characterizing it as a minor event. Later the Japanese erected a monument to the dead. This stone gave the number of dead as 1,327. The true number is believed to be 1,549, 34% of the miners working that day. It was the worst disaster in the history of coal mining and the second-worst recorded industrial accident. Of this number, 31 fatalities were Japanese, the remaining 1,518 were Chinese. The Japanese continued to operate the mine until the end of World War II in 1945, when they were defeated and forced to withdraw from China. Following the Japanese withdrawal, the Chinese workers took control of the site. With the liberation after the war, the Soviet Union investigated the accident. They found that only some of the workers died directly from the gas and coal-dust explosion. Most deaths were from carbon monoxide poisoning produced when the Japanese closed the ventilation and sealed the pit head after the initial explosion.

In many cultures, it is most commonly, but not universally, used to indicate agreement, acceptance, or acknowledgement. To indicate acceptance Different cultures assign different meanings to the gesture. Nodding to indicate \\"yes\\" is widespread, and appears in a large number of diverse cultural and linguistic groups. Areas in which nodding generally takes this meaning include the Indian subcontinent (note that the head bobble also shows agreement there), the Middle East, Southeast Asia, most of Europe (see below), South America and North America. Nodding may also be used as a sign of recognition in some areas, or to show respect. An insult may be inferred if it is not returned in kind. In Greece, the single nod of the head down that indicates \\"yes\\" is often combined with closing the eyes simultaneously. This nod commonly also includes a very slight, almost unnoticeable, turn of the head to the left (or to the right). An early survey of nodding and other gestures was The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, written by Charles Darwin in 1872. Darwin wrote to missionaries in many parts of the world asking for information on local gestures, and concluded that nodding for \\"yes\\" was common to many different groups. There are varying theories as to why nodding is so frequently used to indicate acceptance. One simple theory is that it is a form of bowing, indicating that one is prepared to accept what another person is saying or requesting. It has also been statedDarwin, Charles. The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1913; Page 272, accessed through Google Book Search. that babies, when hungry, search for milk by moving their heads vertically, but decline milk by turning their head from side to side. To indicate refusal There are several exceptions: in Greece, Cyprus, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria,Nonverbal Communication: Yes and No in Bulgaria - Kerry Kubilius, tripsavvy.com Albania, and Sicily a single nod of the head up (not down) indicates a \\"no\\". Some cultures also swap the meanings between nodding and head shaking. Specifically in Greece and in Cyprus, the single nod of the head up that indicates \\"no\\" is almost always combined with a simultaneous raise of the eyebrows and most commonly also with a slight (or complete) rolling up of the eyes. There is also a sound that sometimes accompanies the whole gesture, called \\"œÑœÉŒøœÖ\\". This sound bears heavy resemblance, but is not identical, to the British tutting sound. The use of \\"œÑœÉŒøœÖ\\" is optional and reserved only for heavy emphasis on the \\"no\\". The emphasis on the raised eyebrows and the rolling up of the eyes is such, that the actual nod of the head upwards has ended up being of secondary importance. A person can denote \\"no\\" by simply raising their eyebrows and rolling up their eyes, with the head staying completely still. As greeting Nodding can also be used as a form of nonverbal greeting or acknowledgement of another's presence; in this context, it is essentially an especially mild form of bowing, with just enough movement to show a degree of respect without additional formality. This includes the traditional downwards nod, or the upwards nod (which is more informal and usually used among friends or subordinates). To increase the formality, the downwards nod may also be accompanied by a suitable verbal greeting. Nodding syndrome Nodding is also a symptom of nodding disease, a yet unexplained disease. It affects mostly children under 15, and was first documented in Tanzania in 1962.https://news.yahoo.com/photos/mysterious-nodding-disease- slideshow/children-suffering-nodding-syndrome-gather-akoya-lamin-omony- photo-173929058.html  See also  Head bobble * Head shake * Physical distancing References External linksThe Straight Dope *Imponderables Gestures Human head and neck ","title":"Nod (gesture)"},{"id":"1833556","text":"James Bernard Machen (; born March 26, 1944) is an American university professor and administrator.

Love (Ishq) and a social conscience are for him the foundation of religion; mankind is asleep, living in a desolate world. To Sanai common religion was only habit and ritual. Sanai's poetry had a tremendous influence upon Persian literature.

What real merit or punishment can there be? * He who knows not his own soul, how shall he know the soul of another? and he who only knows hand and foot, how shall he know the Godhead? The prophets are unequal to understanding this matter; why dost thou foolishly claim to do so? When thou hast brought forward a demonstration of this subject, then thou wilt know the pure essence of the faith; otherwise what have faith and thou in common? thou hadst best be silent, and speak not folly.

Its mission is to enrich the lives of people in the Southern California entertainment community by continuously evolving to meet their health and human services needs. History The need for a fund to benefit colleagues who fell on hard times was seen by many in the early days of motion pictures. It began with coin boxes at studios, where industry workers would drop their spare change for their colleagues. The MPTF was created by such industry luminaries as Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Conrad Nagel, Milton Sills, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and D. W. Griffith. In 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was incorporated with Joseph M. Schenck as first president, Pickford was vice president and the Reverend Neal Dodd (who portrayed ministers in more than 300 films) as administrator, each with a benevolent spirit intent on providing assistance to those in the motion picture industry who were in need. The original Board of Trustees included prominent names in Hollywood such as Charles Christie, Cecil B. DeMille, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., William S. Hart, Jesse L. Lasky, Harold Lloyd, Mae Murray, Hal Roach, Donald Crisp and Irving Thalberg. The advent of talkies in the late twenties brought many changes to the film industry. While talkies launched many new careers, hundreds of actors, directors, and writers who had not foreseen the change to the industry or their livelihood, became unemployed. MPRF came to their aid. As more requests for assistance were made, celebrity-packed benefits were held. Celebrity balls, benefit movie premieres, polo matches, fashion shows, and card parties were all means of raising funds for MPRF with talent provided by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Will Rogers. These events raised thousands of dollars in aid, but it was not enough to keep up with the demand for assistance. Other methods of fundraising were needed. In 1932, Pickford began the Payroll Pledge Program, a deduction plan for those earning over $200 a week. Studio workers were asked to pledge one-half of one percent of their earnings to the Fund. In 1938, participation in the program was increased by including talent groups, unions and producer representatives. The Screen Actors Guild improved this effort by ruling for compulsory contributions by its Class A members. The president Jean Hersholt was seeking an opportunity to supplement the income produced through Payroll Pledge. Dr. Jules C. Stein came up with the idea to have major movie stars appear on a new radio program The Screen Guild Show, whereby they would donate their normal salaries to MPRF. Members of the Directors and Writers Guilds also contributed their services to the show, which premiered on over 61 CBS stations in 1939. The first program starred such greats as Jack Benny, Judy Garland, and Joan Crawford, and quickly became one of the most popular programs on network radio, raising $5.3 million for MPRF during its 13-year run. Every major star participated at least once: Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Gary Cooper, Bing Crosby, Natalie Wood, Bob Hope, Betty Grable, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, and Tyrone Power. In 1940, Jean Hersholt found the property for the future Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital. It was of walnut and orange groves, selling for 850 dollars per acre. The Board was able to purchase the land from the money raised from The Screen Guild Show. They immediately sold to offset the costs for the first buildings of the Country House, designed by architect William Pereira. On September 27, 1942, three thousand members of the film community gathered in Woodland Hills for its dedication. In 1948, the Motion Picture & Television Hospital was dedicated. Eventually, the Fund offered services to those working in television, and in 1971 the Motion Picture Relief Fund became Motion Picture & Television Fund. Recent history In 1993, the Motion Picture & Television Fund Foundation was established with Jeffrey Katzenberg as Founding Chairman. The Foundation continues to exist as the conduit to marshal the vision of its donors and their philanthropy to the growing human needs of the entertainment community it serves. The MPTF Foundation puts on annual events that help raise millions of dollars in funds to continue to assist those entertainment industry members in need. These events include Michael Douglas and Friends Golf Tournament, The Night Before and The Evening Before. On September 13, 1996, the MPTF Corporation was created within the State of California and its corporate number is C1989085. Dr. David Tillman, MPTF President and CEO is listed as \\"Agent for Service of Process\\" with the California Secretary of State. Frank Mancuso, Sr. is Chairman of the MPTF Corporate Board. In 1998, the Woodland Hills campus was renamed The Wasserman Campus of the Motion Picture & Television Fund in honor of the long-time commitment and support of Mr. & Mrs. Lew Wasserman. In February 2000, William Haug resigned as MPTF CEO, and succeeded by Dr. David Tillman on May 16, 2000. In 2006, the groundbreaking for the Saban Center for Health and Wellness featuring the Jodie Foster Aquatic Pavilion was held on The Wasserman Campus. The center was named after donors Haim Saban and his wife Dr. Cheryl Saban.MPTF PDF profile It opened its doors on July 18, 2007, and features aquatic and land-based therapies as well as MPTF‚Äôs Center on Aging, a best practice model which provides a variety of programs that are geared toward improving the lives of the entertainment industry seniors throughout Southern California. A new and emerging need to address quality of life issues for older adults in their own homes was identified and led to the creation of such MPTF programs and initiatives as Palliative Care, Elder Connection, Rebuilding Together and the MPTF Age Well Program. On November 20, 2006, the Motion Picture & Television Fund registered the MPTF Endowment Corporation with California's Secretary of State. Its California corporate number is C2934691. Dr. Tillman is listed as \\"Agent for Service of Process\\" with the California Secretary of State. Besides offering temporary financial assistance and operating the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, MPTF's comprehensive services operate six outpatient health centers throughout the greater Los Angeles area as well as the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation Children‚Äôs Center. There was a turbulent period starting in early 2009 when the MPTF announced that rising costs amid the recession would force it to shutter its long-term care unit, which had 136 patients at the time, as well as its acute- care hospital. That decision created a barrage of criticism with some questioning the fund‚Äôs commitment to its stated goal of ‚Äútaking care of our own. The MPTF restructured, brought in Bob Beitcher in 2010 and launched an aggressive $350 million fundraising campaign in 2012 headed by Jeffrey Katzenberg and George Clooney. Beitcher said the fundraising push was to provide a safety net for the 75,000 baby boomers who would be retiring from the industry over the next 20 years. At that point, $238 million had already been raised with key contributions from Clooney, Steve Bing, Tom Cruise, Barry Diller, Fox Entertainment Group, David Geffen, Michael Lewis, Jerry Perenchio, Joe Roth, Jeffrey and Marilyn Katzenberg, Todd Phillips, Patrick Soon-shiong, Thomas Tull and John Wells, among others. As of 2014, $325 million has been raised for this campaign. For its health care centers, MPTF partnered with UCLA Health which today operates five MPTF health care centers in Los Angeles. These health centers are still exclusive to entertainment industry members. The brainchild of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the annual ‚ÄúNight Before the Oscars‚Äù launched in 2003, and remains one of the main MPTF fundraising events. The latest 14th annual \\"Night Before\\" party held February 27, 2016 raised a total of $5.2 million to benefit the MPTF More than $70 million has been raised since the event was launched 14 years ago. Through June 1, 2014, the MPTF‚Äôs operations include a 250-bed multilevel care hospital, seven primary care health centers, a 186 unit retirement community providing independent and assisted living, and a free-standing child care facility.Motion Picture and Television Fund and Affiliated Entities Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2014 and 2013 To date, the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation is the single largest donor in the foundation‚Äôs 93-year history, with the family‚Äôs total contributions to the MPTF upwards of $55 million.

History The historical sources of 1579 mention an International Gothic building in the same place. However, it later fell into disuse and then into ruin. Around 1765 the parcel was bought by Antoni Tyzenhaus (Antanas Tyzenhauzas in Lithuanian translation), a treasurer of Lithuania, starost of Grodno and a close friend of the Polish king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. A notable personality of the epoch, Tyzenhauz was a manager of royal grounds in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and was responsible for a major industrialisation effort in the area of Grodno. In the early 1770s he ordered the construction of a new, classical style palace. Antoni Tyzenhaus, the founder and the name-sake of the palace The house was most probably constructed by a Venetian architect Giuseppe de Sacco. After Tyzenhaus went bankrupt and was dismissed in 1777, the palace fell into disuse. After Tyzenhaus' death in 1785, it was sold to General Fitinhof's widow. She bought the palace in 1789 and she ordered its reconstruction and refurbishment the following year. The work was most probably carried out by German-born architect and professor at the Jesuit Academy of Vilna Martin Knakfuss. The new simplistic fa√ßades were added and a so-called Silver hall was built. After the reconstruction, the palace had 30 halls and 16 smaller rooms; and was one of the biggest aristocratic residences in Lithuania. In 1807, yet another refurbishment was carried out by Miko≈Çaj Szulc, after which the interior was modernised and a new staircase was added to the palace. Despite that, in the 19th century the palace yet again fell into disuse and was parcelated between various shops and stores. Many doors and windows were added on the ground floor and the luxurious part of the palace deteriorated. In the early 20th century the palace was bought by E. Bortkiewicz, who ordered the reconstruction of the second floor. Later, after the city of Vilnius/Wilno became a part of Poland in 1922, the 2nd and 3rd floors were yet again reconstructed to house a Hotel Soko≈Çowskiego, named after its owner. During the German bombings of Wilno during the Polish Defensive War the building was heavily damaged. It was further damaged during Operation Ostra Brama in 1944, and only the cellars, ground floor and outer walls were preserved. Unlike many buildings on Vokieƒçi≈≥ street, the palace was rebuilt in 1945. In 1957 the total reconstruction of the palace was led by Algimantas Umbrasas. As with most of the palaces at that time, it was reconstructed by the Soviet authorities to house small apartments. This was due to the shortage of living space in Vilnius caused by a great deal of residential buildings having been destroyed. A fourth floor was added, yet it is invisible from the outside of the palace. After Lithuania regained her independence, the Vilnius Old Town became a prestigious place, and many of the occupants of the palace took the opportunity to sell their flats for a high price. Out of 40 flats that were carved out of the palace, most currently serve as either offices or shops. The building The palace has 3 floors on the street side and 4 floors on the courtyard side. The courtyard is fully enclosed by the building and is accessible through 2 gates, one on each of the adjacent streets. The palace is of trapezoid form. On the street side, the building has a tall attic. It has 2-level gothic cellar, which is currently unused. One of more interesting elements are sculptures which can be seen immediately beneath the attic on the street side; there are many different bas-reliefs. The rooms on the sides of building facing the street are in two lines: each room has windows opening on both the street and the courtyard. The walls facing the courtyard are narrower. Other exposures of the palace face other courtyards. The attic was unused following the rebuilding after World War II, but has been put to commercial use since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

LAFCOs are located in all 58 counties and exercise regulatory and planning powers in step with their prescribed directive to oversee the establishment, expansion, governance, and dissolution of local government agencies and their municipal service areas to meet current and future community needs. LAFCOs were established in 1963 and administer a section of California planning law now known as the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2001. LAFCOs' regulatory powers are outlined in California Government Code Sections 56375 and 56133. This include approving, establishing, expanding, reorganizing, and, in limited circumstances, dissolving cities and special districts. LAFCOs are also responsible for approving all outside service extensions by contract or agreement beginning in 2001. LAFCOs' regulatory powers are generally exercised in response to applications filed by other local agencies, landowners, or registered voters. LAFCOs' are also allowed to initiate certain proposals if consistent with a recommendation from its own planning studies, such as establishing, consolidating, or dissolving special districts. LAFCOs' planning responsibilities are explicit to informing their regulatory powers and highlighted by establishing spheres of influence for all cities and special districts. Spheres of influence represent the State of California's version of municipal growth boundaries and demark the territory that the LAFCO independently believes represents the appropriate and probable future jurisdictional boundary and service area of the subject agency. All jurisdictional boundary changes and outside service extensions, notably, must be consistent with the subject agencies' spheres of influence, with limited exceptions. History They were established in 1963 in all California counties except San Francisco, which would obtain one only in 2001, by the California State Legislature. Their current legal authority and mandate are defined by the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000 (Government Code Section 56000 et seq). LAFCOs' powers and duties have expanded in step with subsequent legislation and most recently include regulating cities and districts' ability to provide services outside their jurisdictional boundaries by contract or agreement. LAFCOs also must approve requests by districts to either expand their service powers and/or divest existing service powers. Authority LAFCOs have both regulatory and planning authority: * As a regulatory agency, they are for \\"discouraging urban sprawl and encouraging the orderly formation and development of local agencies\\" based on \\"local circumstances and conditions.\\" Key regulatory responsibilities include establishing (formations and incorporations), expanding (annexations), decreasing (detachments), combining (mergers and consolidations), and eliminating (dissolutions and disincorporations) cities and special districts as well as authorizing outside service contracts. * As a planning agency, it is charged to determine and update, at least every five years, the sphere of influence of each city and special district. In updating spheres of influence, it must prepare Municipal Service Reviews of relevant local agencies and services. It may initiate proposals to consolidate special districts, merge a special district with a city, dissolve a special district, establish a subsidiary district, or any combination of them. Under the agency, no community within an incorporated city has ever been granted city status. That is partially because the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000 makes it difficult for communities to break away from their original cities, as the community must gain approval from the city from which it is detaching, and it requires two thirds of the entire community and re-affected city to agree. The only community within a city ever to be brought before a vote by LAFCO was the San Fernando Valley in the early 2000s, which was denied. No detachments from a city have been successful in the state since 1947. LAFCOs are governed by a commission consisting of appointed elected officials representing the county board of supervisors, city councils, and - at least for most - special district directors. (Not all LAFCOs have special district representation.) The appointed elected officials on LAFCO also appoint members from the general public to serve on the commission. LAFCO funding is provided by local agencies and divided in one-third apportionments between the county, cities, and special districts with the latter amounts further divided among the individual agencies based on tax revenues. =Types= According to the Committee on Local Government of the California Senate, LAFCOs regulate all city and most special district boundaries, including these: * Airport districts * California water districts * Community services districts * County sanitation districts * County service areas * County water districts * County waterworks districts * Fire protection districts * Harbor and port districts * Healthcare districts * Irrigation districts * Library districts * Mosquito abatement districts * Municipal utility districts * Municipal water districts * Pest control districts * Police protection districts * Public cemetery districts * Public utility districts * Reclamation districts * Recreation and park districts * Resource conservation districts * Sanitary districts * Sewer districts * Sewer maintenance districts * Vector control districts LAFCOs do not directly regulate counties.

Magnitude 6.6 - Kyushu, Japan Verified 2011-03-20. and named it and its subsequent aftershocks the . The quake occurred along a previously unknown fault in the Genkai Sea, North of Fukuoka city, and the residents of Genkai island were forced to evacuate as houses collapsed and landslides occurred in places. Investigations subsequent to the earthquake determined that the new fault was most likely an extension of the known Kego fault that runs through the centre of the city. Fukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, and was known prior to the earthquake as one of Japan's safest locations in terms of natural disasters; the previous earthquake, a magnitude 5, had occurred over a hundred years ago and it had been centuries since the city had experienced a serious earthquake. City Introduction Fukuoka is located in the northern Kyushu, Japan, and it is in the center of Fukuoka plain. Fukuoka is the most populous and developed prefecture in Kyushu. In geographically, Fukuoka is close to mainland east Asia, and the nearest megacity to Fukuoka is Seoul, South Korea, rather than a domestic Japanese city, and Fukuoka is about as far from Shanghai as Tokyo. As a result, Fukuoka has been the window of east Asian culture flowing into Japan since ancient times, and now there are many direct routes to Korea, mainland China and Taiwan. Description The strong earthquake occurred at 10:53 am in the Kyushu region, about 70 km west of shimonoseki city in Yamaguchi prefecture. The depth of the earthquake was extremely shallow, with a presumed Richter scale of 7.0. The Japan meteorological agency said that quake's epicenter was in the sea of Japan, northwest of Fukuoka prefecture, and the epicenter was about 9 kilometers under the sea. As of 6 p.m. local time, the earthquake has caused 381 people injured and one dead. Kyodo news agency, citing Japan's meteorological agency, said it was the strongest earthquake to hit kyushu since May 1997, and the first to exceed magnitude 6 since 1898. Earthquake experts in Japan said it is rare for a strong earthquake to strike the area. A quake measuring about seven on the Richter scale struck three hundred years ago, but no major quake has struck after that. Fukuoka's most famous major fault, the Kego fault, runs northwest to southeast, roughly parallel to Nishitetsu's ≈åmuta train line, and was thought to be 22 km long, terminating at Hakata Bay. It is estimated to be able to produce earthquakes as strong as magnitude 7 at the epicenter approximately once every 15,000 years. When a center is located at a depth of 10 km, it would cause an earthquake of a lower-6 magnitude (similar to the March 20, 2005 earthquake) in downtown Fukuoka. The probability of an earthquake along the known length of the Kego fault occurring within 30 years was estimated at 0.4% prior to the March 20, 2005 earthquake, but this probability has been revised upwards since. According to a National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology presentation April 12, 2005 , supposing the last Kego earthquake had occurred 13,000 years ago, the probability of major activity within 30 years had been revised to 7%, or it were 7,000 years ago, the probability had been revised to 4%. Suppose that an earthquake had occurred along the Kego fault within the last 2000 years, the risk would be unchanged. M5.8 aftershock on April 20 An aftershock hit at 6:11 a.m. April 20 on Japan's southern main island of Ky≈´sh≈´, the Central Meteorological Agency reported. Although considerable time had passed since the first quake, the aftershock was not unexpected. The quake, which swayed buildings and shattered some outer walls, was measured to have magnitude of 5.8. 2 and 56 people were severely and slightly injured and treated at a hospital in Fukuoka due to the quake and there were temporary closures of major highways, railway services and Fukuoka's airport. Following reports that the city has only prepared for earthquakes up to a magnitude of 6.5, the aftershock renewed fears that the quakes might cause the Kego fault to become active again beneath Fukuoka, leading to an earthquake as big as, or bigger than, the March 20 quake. In order to more accurately estimate the risk of ongoing or increased seismic activity, teams from Tokyo University, K≈çchi University, Hiroshima University and ≈åita University surveyed Hakata Bay to determine how far the Kego fault extends. Preliminary results, announced May 1, 2005 indicated that the fault extends nearly as far as Nokonoshima, 2.5 km out into the bay, though no sign of recent activity along the fault was uncovered. The teams also discovered a new fault in the Higashi-ku portion of Hakata Bay. Later findings indicated that the fault responsible for both the March 20 and April 20 quakes was likely an extension of the Kego fault, making its total length approximately 40 km. Aftershocks Situation After the main shock of the Fukuoka earthquake, several smaller aftershocks happened around the source. By 9 p.m. Tuesday, 85 aftershocks had been recorded. Within a month of the quake, there were four aftershocks with a magnitude of more than 5, including the largest one of M5.8 on April 20. Within half a year the size of aftershocks continued, a total of several thousand times, but the overall trend gradually reducedBiggest Earthquakes Near Fukuoka, Japan. . Effects of Earthquake =Architecture= During this earthquake, more than half of the 225 residential buildings on the Gemanjie Island in the western part of Fukuoka city, near the epicenter, suffered serious damage. The island was particularly hard hit because it near to the quake and traditional Japanese homes are less vulnerable to earthquakes than \\"mansions\\" that are built by engineers. In Kaido, about 120 homes were destroyed and another 55 damaged partially. ITraditional Japanese houses, particularly in the areas of Daimy≈ç and Imaizumi, were the most heavily damaged and many were marked for demolition. Insurance payments for damage were estimated at approximately 15.8 billion yen. In Tianjin, many windows were smashed and concrete cracked. Temples and shrines were also damaged a lot. More than half of the 225 residential buildings on the Gemanjie Island in the western part of Fukuoka city, near the epicenter, suffered serious damage =Transportation= According to public broadcaster NHK, local rail services were suspended after the tremors triggered an automatic safety mechanism. The operation of the Shanyang Shinkansen between Xinshankou and Bodoi was temporarily suspended. The cracks appeared on sidewalks in residential areas. =Other Effects= Officials reported water and gas breaks and power outages. Telephone service in the southern prefecture was jammed after an automatic safety mechanism was triggered by the tremors. The quake also caused 103 gas leaks. The meteorological agency issued a tsunami warning after the strong earthquake, but lifted it at noon. Landslides occurred around Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures. =The impact on Other Countries= Kyushu, which is separated from South Korea by a narrow strait, was felt about 130 miles from the South Korean port city of Busan, where it briefly shook buildings. A Busan police spokesman said no damage was immediately reported.

It was an outgrowth of the Bar-Giora group and was disbanded after the founding of the Haganah in 1920. Hashomer was responsible for guarding Jewish settlements in the Yishuv, freeing Jewish communities from dependence upon foreign consulates and Arab watchmen for their security. It was headed by a committee of three‚ÄîIsrael Shochat, Israel Giladi, and Mendel Portugali.  History  Hashomer members, some wearing keffiyeh and agal in 1909. Hashomer was originated by Socialist Zionists, mostly members of Poale Zion, including Israel Shochat, Manya Shochat, Yehezkel Henkin, Yitzhak Ben- Zvi and Ben-Zvi's wife Rachel Yanait, several of whom had earlier formed a small secret guard society called Bar-Giora, which guarded the Sejera commune (now Ilaniya) and Mes'ha (now Kfar Tavor). Bar-Giora was founded on September 29, 1907 by Israel Shochat, Alexander Za√Ød, Yehezkel Henkin in the apartment of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi which was in Jaffa. Less than two years later, on April 12, 1909 the Bar-Giora leadership decided at a meeting in Mes'ha to disband their organization and create a larger one, Hashomer. While earlier settlers had undertaken to defend their lands and communities, Hashomer was the first attempt to provide an organized defence for all the Jewish communities in Palestine. By 1910 Yehezkel Henkin was the first of the Shomer people to ride horseback so he became a riding guard. He taught other ‚ÄúWatchmen‚Äù how to ride. This prompted the committee to buy him a horse that he named \\"Tzipora\\". A serious obstacle was the lack of funds with which to buy arms. On Yehoshua Hankin's advice, they asked Eliahu Krause, the manager at Sejera, to lend them the money. The first guns were bought, several of the members refusing to part from them even for a moment. They adopted local dress, and many of the customs of the Bedouins, Druze and Circassians. They also drew inspiration from the history of the Cossacks. The first few Shomrim (guards), worked on foot, but soon acquired horses, which vastly increased their effectiveness. Mendel Portugali laid down the rules of engagement. > You do not seek an encounter with the thief; you chase him off, and only > when you have no choice do you shoot. After all, he is out to steal a bag of > grain, not to murder you, so don't murder him, drive him off. Don't sleep at > night. If you hear footsteps, fire into the distance. If you feel he is a > few steps away and you can fire without him falling upon you, fire into the > distance. Only if your life is in danger‚Äîfire. Guns used were the same as the locals', which included the 'jift', a single, or double-barrelled shotgun, the 'yunani' and 'osmanli' single-shot muskets, various rifles and Mauser pistols. Modern rifles, known as 'Abu-Hamsa' (father of five), were the most prestigious, and were prone to theft by the locals. The 'shibriyeh' (Arab dagger) and 'nabut' (club or mace) were carried by all. Ammunition was expensive and hard to come by, so primitive production centers were set up. Hashomer was successful in providing defense for settlements throughout the country; though it sometimes aroused the ire of Arab watchmen, who lost their jobs, and of pilferers, and antagonized the Arab population by retaliatory raids. Some of the older settlers were also worried that Hashomer might upset the status-quo with the local population. During World War I many of its members were exiled to Anatolia by the Ottoman government because they were enemy (Russian) nationals. Several were hanged. When the Turks caught Yosef Lishanski of the Nili group, he told all he knew, implicating twelve members of Hashomer. The group nonetheless survived. In 1920 it was decided to organize the Haganah, a much broader-based group, to cope with new defense challenges and needs of the growing Jewish community in Palestine. Many members of Hashomer joined the Jewish Legion, while others joined the mounted police, and played a prominent part in the defense of Tel Hai and Jerusalem during the Arab riots in 1920 and 1921. In June 1920 HaShomer ceased to exist as a separate body. Its members, however, maintained contact and made an important contribution to the Yishuv's defense. The Haganah itself became the core of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). In addition to their role as watchmen of the Jewish settlements in the country, members of Hashomer established a number of settlements of their own, including Tel Adash, Tel Hai, and Kfar Giladi. Professor , Dean of Humanities at the University of Haifa, described the Hashomer as \\"...illiterate people, chauvinist. They spoke Yiddish and not Hebrew. Even a poor Yiddish, they curse a lot. They were people I wouldn't like to meet in Sderot at midnight.\\" Gallery File:◊™◊ú ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë -◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊í◊ú◊¢◊ì◊ô- JNF010028.jpegIsrael Giladi Image:Members of Hashomer.jpgHashomer members File:◊û◊®◊ó◊ë◊ô◊î - ◊ó◊ë◊®◊ô ◊î◊©◊ï◊û◊®-JNF023708.jpegHashomer members from Merhavia 1915 File:Hashomer Ribbon.jpgThe IDF's Hashomer ribbon File:Tel hai inscription.jpgHashomer memorial at Tel Hai  Notable members Israel Shochat *Manya Shochat *Yitzhak Ben-Zvi *Alexander Za√Ød *Mendel Portugali *Israel Giladi *Eliyahu Golomb See alsoJewish Supernumerary Police *Jewish Settlement Police References External linksJewish Virtual Library: Hashomer Jews and Judaism in Ottoman Palestine Militant Zionist groups Military units and formations established in 1909 Military units and formations disestablished in 1920 Zionist organizations 1909 establishments in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Hashomer"},{"id":"1833609","text":"This is a list of Pashto language poets.

In this example a Unix-like operating system is using the X windowing system and the Compiz cube plugin to decorate the KDE desktop environment. In computing, a virtual desktop is a term used with respect to user interfaces, usually within the WIMP paradigm, to describe ways in which the virtual space of a computer's desktop environment is expanded beyond the physical limits of the screen's display area through the use of software. This compensates for a limited desktop area and can also be helpful in reducing clutter. There are two major approaches to expanding the virtual area of the screen. Switchable virtual desktops allow the user to make virtual copies of their desktop view- port and switch between them, with open windows existing on single virtual desktops. Another approach is to expand the size of a single virtual screen beyond the size of the physical viewing device. Typically, scrolling/panning a subsection of the virtual desktop into view is used to navigate an oversized virtual desktop.  Overview  = Switching desktops = Switchable desktops were designed and implemented at Xerox PARC as \\"Rooms\\" by Austin Henderson and Stuart Card in 1986D. Austin Henderson, Jr., Stuart Card (1986) Rooms: the use of multiple virtual workspaces to reduce space contention in a window-based graphical user interface ACM Transactions on Graphics and (unknowingly to the authors until their publication) was conceptually similar to earlier work by Patrick Peter Chan in 1984. This work was covered by a US patent.User interface with multiple workspaces for sharing display system objects, US Patent 5,533,183 Switchable desktops were introduced to a much larger audience by Tom LaStrange in swm (the Solbourne Window Manager, for the X Window System) in 1989. (\\"Virtual Desktop\\" was originally a trademark of Solbourne Computer.)Thomas E. LaStrange (1990) swm: An X window manager shell. USENIX Summer. Rather than simply being placed at an x, y position on the computer's display, windows of running applications are then placed at x, y positions on a given virtual desktop ‚Äúcontext‚Äù. They are then only accessible to the user if that particular context is enabled. A switching desktop provides a pager for the user to switch between \\"contexts\\", or pages of screen space, only one of which can be displayed on the computer's display at any given time. Several X window managers provide switching desktops. = Oversized Desktops = Other kinds of virtual desktop environments do not offer discrete virtual screens, but instead make it possible to pan around a desktop that is larger than the available hardware is capable of displaying. This facility is sometimes referred to as panning, scrolling desktops or view-port. For example, if a graphics card has a maximum resolution that is higher than the monitor's display resolution, the virtual desktop manager may allow windows to be placed \\"off the edge\\" of the screen. The user can then scroll to them by moving the mouse pointer to the edge of the display. The visible part of the larger virtual screen is called a viewport.  Implementation  Virtual desktop managers are available for most graphical user interface operating systems and offer various features, such as placing different wallpapers for each virtual desktop and use of hotkeys or other convenient methods to allow the user to switch amongst the different screens. = Amiga = The first platform to implement multiple desktop display as a hardware feature was Amiga 1000, released in 1985. All Amigas supported multiple in-memory screens displayed concurrently via the use of the graphics co-processor, AKA the \\"Copper\\". The Copper was a simple processor that could wait for a screen position and write to hardware registers. Using the GUI implemented in system ROM API's, programs could transparently display multiple independent screens, from non-consecutive memory, without moving the memory. This hardware-based scrolling does not use blitting, but something more like what is sometimes called hardware panning. The video output is simply told (once, or many times) where to display (scanline) and from what screen memory address. A screen can move to any position, or display any portion, by modifying the wait, or fetch position. Typically a single byte value. The Copperlist did need to be sorted in vertical and horizontal wait position in order to function. Note: See http://www.faqs.org/faqs/amiga/books/ for a list of reference material. Each desktop or 'screen' could have its own colour depth (number of available colours) and resolution, including use of interlacing. The display chipset ('graphics card' on a PC) could switch between these desktop modes on the fly, and during the drawing of a single screen, usually with three pixel deep line between each desktop shown on the screen. However, if one interlaced (flickering) desktop was displayed, all desktops onscreen would be similarly affected. This also allowed the OS to seamlessly mix \\"Full Screen\\" and Windowed \\"desktop\\"-style applications in a single environment. Some programs, VWorldshttps://aminet.net/package/misc/sci/VWorlds30 (an astronomy simulator) being an example, used the multiple desktops feature to overlay a set of controls over the main display screen. The controls could then be dragged up and down in order to show more or less of the main display. =X Window System (Unix and Unix-like)= Dynamic virtual desktops in GNOME Shell. Workspaces are automatically added or deleted as the existing ones are respectively consumed or freed. Almost all Unix and Unix-like systems use the X Window System to provide their windowing environment. The X Window System is unique in that the decoration, placement, and management of windows are handled by a separate, replaceable program known as a window manager. This separation allowed third-party developers to introduce a host of different window manager features, resulting in the early development of virtual desktop capabilities in X. The first implementation of virtual desktops for Unix was vtwm in 1990. Many of today's X window managers now include virtual desktop capabilities. Configurations range from as few as two virtual desktops to several hundred. The most popular desktop environments, GNOME and KDE, use multiple virtual desktops (two or four by default) called workspaces. Some window managers, like FVWM, offer separate \\"desks\\" that allow the user to organize applications even further. For example, a user may have separate desks labeled \\"Work\\" and \\"Home\\", with the same programs running on both desks, but fulfilling different functions. Some window managers such as dwm and Sawfish support \\"tagging\\" where applications can be configured to always launch on a particular desktop, supporting automatic organization and consistent navigation. = OS/2 = IBM's personal computer OS/2 operating system included multiple desktops (up to 4 natively) in the OS/2 Warp 4 release in 1996. This functionality has also been provided by the open source XWorkplace project, with support for up to 100 virtual desktops. XWorkplace is included with the ArcaOS distribution of OS/2. = Windows = Virtual desktop in Windows 10 showing two open apps in the same desktop, with a thumbnail showing another desktop Windows 10 offers virtual desktops through a system known as \\"Task View\\". Prior to Windows 10, Microsoft Windows did not implement virtual desktops natively in a user- accessible way. There are objects in the architecture of Windows known as \\"desktop objects\\" that are used to implement separate screens for logon and the secure desktop sequence (). There is no native and easy way for users to create their own desktops or populate them with programs.\\"Desktops.\\" Windows Dev Center. 27 Mar 2012 21:35 EST. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/ms682573.aspx However, there are many third-party (e. g. VirtuaWin, Dexpot and others) and some partially supported Microsoft products that implement virtual desktops to varying degrees of completeness. Microsoft offers a utility called Desktops which allows users running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 or later operating systems to run applications on up to 4 virtual desktops. Unlike nearly all other virtual desktop solutions for Windows, this utility actually uses native \\"desktop objects,\\" as discussed above. Because of this, it does not offer the ability to move programs between desktops, or in fact to stop using virtual desktops at all, short of logging off,\\"Desktops.\\" Windows Sysinternals, Microsoft TechNet. 17 Oct 2010 11:07 AM EDT. https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc817881.aspx and Windows Aero only works on the primary desktop object. Microsoft had previously provided a Virtual Desktop PowerToy for Windows XP, which simulates many desktops with the more common method of hiding and showing windows in groups, each group being a different desktop. However, the functionality provided is less comprehensive than that of many other virtual desktop solutions (e. g. maintain a window in a given desktop even when its application bar button flashes, etc.). As with all virtual desktop utilities that work by hiding and showing windows, application compatibility problems are common, because application developers do not expect virtual desktops to be in use on the Windows platform. Historically, software packaged with some video card drivers provided virtual desktop functionality, such as in Nvidia's nView product (this product has been discontinued for GeForce card owners since Vista). Some of these programs provide eye-candy features similar to those available on Compiz. Many desktop shell replacements for Windows, including LiteStep, Emerge Desktop and others, also support virtual desktops via optional modules. = Mac OS X = Despite its Unix underpinnings, Mac OS X does not use the X Window System for its GUI, and early versions had no provision for virtual desktops. Beginning with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in late 2007, Mac OS X has shipped with native virtual desktop support, called Spaces, which allows up to 16 virtual desktops. It allows the user to associate applications with a particular \\"Space\\". As of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, this functionality has been moved into Mission Control. Scrolling desktops were made available to Macintosh users by a 3rd party extension called Stepping Out created by Wes Boyd (the future founder of Berkeley Systems) in 1986. The code for this extension was integrated by Apple into a later version of the Mac OS, although the ability to create virtual desktops larger than the screen was removed. The code was used instead as an assist for visually impaired users to zoom into portions of the desktop and view them as larger, more easily discerned images. = BeOS = BeOS includes an implementation of virtual desktops called \\"Workspaces\\". Up to 32 different Workspaces are supported.

CEQA does not directly regulate land uses, but instead requires state and local agencies within California to follow a protocol of analysis and public disclosure of environmental impacts of proposed projects and, in a departure from NEPA, adopt all feasible measures to mitigate those impacts. CEQA makes environmental protection a mandatory part of every California state and local (public) agency's decision making process. It has also become the basis for numerous lawsuits concerning public and private projects. CEQA has been criticized for being \\"abused\\" (used for reasons than environmental ones) to block, downsize, delay, or gain other concessions from new development. Residents use CEQA to try to block homeless shelters and affordable housing projects from being located in their neighborhoods; one study found that 85% of CEQA lawsuits were filed by organizations with no record of environmental advocacy and 80% of CEQA lawsuits targeted infill development; CEQA requirements have dramatically increased the difficulty of creating bicycle lanes on already existing roads; and unions have used CEQA lawsuits or threats thereof to force developers to use union workers.See the section on Criticisms for more detail with sources cited. Policy The CEQA statute, California Public Resources Code ¬ß 21000 et seq., codifies a statewide policy of environmental protection. According to the act, all state and local agencies must give major consideration to environmental protection in regulating public and private activities, and should not approve projects for which there exist feasible and environmentally superior mitigation measures or alternatives. CEQA process overview CEQA mandates actions all state and local agencies must take to advance that policy. Specifically, for any project under CEQA's jurisdiction with potentially significant environmental impacts, agencies must identify mitigation measures and alternatives by preparing an Environmental Impact Report, and must approve projects with feasible mitigation measures and the environmentally superior alternative. The California Resources Agency promulgates the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations Title 14 ¬ß 15000 et seq., which detail the protocol by which state and local agencies comply with CEQA requirements. Appendix A of the CEQA Guidelines summarizes this protocol in flowchart form. CEQA originally applied to only public projects, but California Supreme Court interpretation of the statute, as well as later revisions to the wording, have expanded the CEQA's jurisdiction to nearly all projects within California, including those accomplished by private businesses and individuals. ¬ß 21002.1: \\"Each public agency shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so.\\" For private projects, CEQA applies when a discretionary government permit or other entitlement for use is necessary.

When more than one agency is involved in a project, the agency with primary responsibility for approving a project is the lead agency, for purposes of following the CEQA protocol. # Responsible Agency: Other agencies with discretionary approval power over the project are called \\"responsible agencies.\\" The lead agency has an obligation to consult with these agencies during the CEQA process to ensure their input is accounted for. Responsible agencies often have a vested interest in a specific environmental resource that they are charged with regulating. # Trustee Agency: An agency with jurisdiction over a resource held in trust for the people. This agency has no approval power over a project. =Initial study= If a project is not exempt from CEQA, a lead agency can conduct an initial study to preliminarily assess project impacts. Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines lists types of environmental impacts to consider in checklist form. This initial study guides the lead agency to prepare either a negative declaration, mitigated negative declaration, or environmental impact report depending on the impact assessment. The initial study completion also gives the project applicant opportunity to change their project scope early in the CEQA process if the initial study indicates significant impact(s) are likely. If the lead agency determines the project clearly has significant impacts, they can skip the initial study phase and immediately conduct an Environmental Impact Report. =Thresholds of significance= Under CEQA, every agency in the state \\"is encouraged to develop and publish thresholds of significance\\" against which to compare the environmental impacts of projects. Such thresholds are to be published for public review and supported by substantial evidence before their adoption. A lead agency will normally consider the environmental impacts of a project to be significant if and only if they exceed established thresholds of significance. According to a 2001 survey, however, few agencies have actually developed thresholds of significance. The survey's analysts wondered, \\"if most agencies are not developing thresholds and publishing them for public review, then what criteria are they using?\\". In absence of thresholds of significance developed independently by lead agencies, impact assessments apply the significant criteria detailed in Appendix G, Environmental Checklist, of the CEQA Statutes and Guidelines, which is produced by the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR). Lead agencies can also defer to authority agencies that publish their recommended guidelines for the resources they regulate. Examples of this include the California Department of Conservation has threshold tests for assessing impacts to agricultural resources using the LESA model, and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District has published guidelines for air quality impacts. Environmental impact analysis The lead agency must analyze project impacts to 18 different environmental resource factors detailed in Appendix G during their CEQA review. The next section discusses background and setting for each resource factor; and how lead agencies conduct their analysis and the authority for their significance thresholds for these resources. =Aesthetics= =Agricultural resources= =Air quality= =Biological resources= =Cultural Resources= =Geology and Soils= =Greenhouse gases= GHG legislative history; rule making; regulated greenhouse gases and their sources; and GHG CEQA responsible agencies are discussed below. The next section describes the analytical approach to determining if a project has significant GHG impacts using guidelines from two Air Quality Management Districts in California. Finally, mitigation measures recommended by air districts and used on various projects are presented for GHG impact analysis. Introduction and setting Greenhouse gas emissions were not required to be analyzed as an impact to the environment when CEQA was originally adopted. Several scientists have since attributed greenhouse gases to climate change and resulting negative impacts to humans and the environment.[Oreskes N. 2004. The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change. Science. 306(12): 1686.] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report in 2007 stating that human activities are responsible for increased global temperatures. As a result of these assessments, the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 that mandated greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Executive Order S-3-05 in June 2005 that declared California is vulnerable to climate change impacts resulting in loss of Sierra snowpack for water supply and rising sea levels threatening coastal real estate and habitat. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger also signed Executive Order S-21-09 in September 2009 requiring 33% of electricity sold in the California come from renewable resources by 2020 to curb greenhouse gas emissions. This assembly of legislation and evidence of environmental impact led to California enacting requirements for lead agencies to consider greenhouse gas emissions in their CEQA reviews. California Office of Attorney General sent several comment letters to lead agencies urging them to consider greenhouse gas emissions during their CEQA review. Senate Bill 97 required the Governors Office of Planning and Research to develop and recommend new guidelines to analyze greenhouse gas impacts under CEQA. California's Natural Resources Agency adopted new guidelines on December 31, 2009, requiring lead agencies to analyze greenhouse gas emissions under section 15064.4 during their CEQA review through California. The major category of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities is carbon dioxide. Several other primary gases also include methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons. Greenhouse gas sources resulting from project construction activities are typically generated from transportation of materials to the project site and petrol based equipment used during construction of the project itself. Stationary sources emit greenhouse gases from a single point source such as a smoke stack. Stationary source examples include coal- or gas-fired power plants, incinerators, refineries, bakeries, or chemical plants. Projects that are not stationary sources such as residential and commercial developments, schools, and related infrastructure can also contribute to increases in greenhouse gases. These projects emit greenhouse gases from sources such as vehicle mileage trips to site, energy to run the facility, and landscape maintenance equipment. Land use conversion can reduce vegetation sequestration of carbon dioxide. The State Air Resources Board or California Air Resources Board is the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of greenhouse gas emissions under AB32. California's thirty-five local air pollution control districts (APCD's) and air quality management districts (AQMD's) are the agencies primarily responsible for regulating stationary sources of air pollution. These air districts traditionally provide guidance to lead agencies, such as counties, cities and public utilities, on the evaluation of air pollutants under CEQA. Analysis approach The lead agency is the public agency which has the principal responsibility for approving a proposed project. The lead agency determines which type of environmental document will be prepared (Mitigated Negative Declaration, Environmental Impact Report, etc.) and has discretion to adopt significance criteria more conservative than those required by CEQA. ¬ß15064.4 provides a lead agency discretion to determine which type of analysis approach to utilize for a given project level GHG analysis: ‚Äú(1) Use a model or methodology to quantify greenhouse gas emissions resulting from a project, and which model or methodology to use. The lead agency has discretion to select the model or methodology it considers most appropriate provided it supports its decision with substantial evidence. The lead agency should explain the limitations of the particular model or methodology selected for use; and/or (2) Rely on a qualitative analysis or performance based standards.‚Äù The lead agency is charged with making a good-faith effort to ‚Äúdescribe, calculate, or estimate the amount of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from a project.‚Äù Lifecycle analysis of GHG includes the full aggregate quantity of GHG generated from the extraction, production, distribution and use of energy or fuel. If a lead agency had to complete a GHG lifecycle analysis under CEQA, they would have to quantify GHGs produced not only within the spatial boundary of the project site, but GHGs generated from transportation of products to the site and product supply chain production emissions. Several of these energy emissions could be produced overseas leading to difficulty by the lead agency in verification and enforcement of emission thresholds. CEQA guidance currently does not require lifecycle analysis of GHG emissions since the term is not well defined and too speculative, and the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) removed the term ‚ÄúLife Cycle‚Äù from CEQA guidelines in 2010. If any portion of the analysis is considered speculative by the lead agency and not supported by defensible and quantifiable scientific evidence, the impact must be eliminated pursuant to CEQA Guidelines 15145. Thresholds of significance can be determined by reference of air quality management district CEQA guidelines, although the ultimate discretion for thresholds remains with the lead agency. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District, South Coast Air Quality Management District, and San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District are the only districts to date that have adopted CEQA guidelines. Below are highlights from the BAAQMD and SCAQMD: =Bay Area Air Quality Management District= The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) typically acts as the responsible agency for setting CEQA air emission thresholds within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin. The BAAQMD adopted new guidance on June 2, 2010 to address greenhouse gas emission thresholds related to operational related emissions from stationary sources and projects other than stationary sources. Stationary sources are allowed to emit up to 10,000 metric tons (MT) e/year. Other projects are allowed to emit 1,100 MT of e/yr; 4.6 MT e/SP/yr; or compliance with a qualified greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The BAAQMD has not established construction related emissions thresholds, deferring this responsibility to the CEQA lead agency. Chapter 8.2 of the BAAQMD Air Quality Guidelines recommends lead agencies quantify construction emissions and assess if they conflict with AB 32 goals. BAAQMD also recommends using URBEMIS air modeling software to calculate GHG emissions on land use changing projects, and RoadMod software for linear projects. BAAQMD recommends analysis of operational emissions in the five step process: eliminate greenhouse gas analysis if project attributes do not pass screening criteria, quantify emissions using appropriate models, compare unmitigated emissions with thresholds of significance, implement mitigation measures if project is over thresholds of significance, then compare emissions again with thresholds of significance. =South Coast Air Quality Management District= The South Coast Air Quality Management District has developed a tiered analysis process for determining the significance of project-related GHG emissions. If a project is not categorically or otherwise exempt, and if it cannot be shown that the GHG emissions from the project are within GHG budgets in approved regional plans, then project applicants are required to show that the project GHG emissions are below, or mitigated to less than, the applicable following significance screening level: *10,000 metric tons of e per year for industrial projects; or *3,000 metric tons of e per year for commercial or residential projects =Impact mitigation measures= Lead agencies can implement several different mitigation measures to offset or reduce GHG emissions. The BAAQMD recommends using the following best management practices for construction activities: 15% of project's heavy equipment and transportation fleet run on alternative fuels and/or electricity, recycling or reusing 50% of demolition waste, and using 10% local of building materials. Other measures used to reduce construction emissions include limiting equipment idle time, car pooling, and purchase and retire of offsite carbon credits. BAAQMD recommends lead agencies mitigate operational emissions by adopting a qualified GHG Reduction Strategy that is consistent with AB 32. This strategy can be incorporated into the lead agency's general plan or programmatic level policy for assessing GHG emissions. The strategy involves assessing ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù current and forecasted emissions to calculate a baseline for reduction. The lead agency then proposes measures to reduce those emissions to meet AB 32 expectations. BAAQMD recommends the project mitigate to the maximum extent feasible before considering offsite mitigation options, and offsite mitigation should be measurable, enforceable, and occur within the nine-county Bay Area. =Hazards and Hazardous Materials= =Hydrology and Water Quality= =Land Use and Planning= =Mineral Resources= =Noise= =Population and Housing= =Public services= =Recreation= =Transportation and traffic= = Tribal Cultural Resources = =Utilities and Service Systems= =Mandatory Findings of Significance= Level of environmental review Projects may be exempt from CEQA if they are ministerial in nature, have been exempted by the California Congress through a statutory exemption, or fall within any of the classes of exemption by category that CEQA recognizes that do not have a significant impact on the environment. If the lead agency determines the project could have no significant environmental impacts after completing an initial study, no EIR will be necessary, but the lead agency must still prepare a Negative Declaration (Neg Dec) that discloses the impact analysis. If the project could have significant environmental impacts, but the lead agency has incorporated mitigation measures to lower those impacts to less than significant, no EIR will be necessary, but the lead agency must prepare a Mitigated Negative Declaration that demonstrates how all identified significant impacts will be mitigated to below the level of significance. Finally, if the lead agency determines the project may have significant environmental impacts, the lead agency must prepare an EIR. =Ministerial decision= CEQA applies to any action when a project requires discretionary approval by a state or local governmental body. Projects may also require ministerial permits that must comply with general plans and local ordinances such as building permits or marriage licenses. These decisions cannot be denied and provides the governmental body with no judgement as long as the proponent meets the specifications detailed in the permit or license requirements. CEQA does not apply when only ministerial approval is necessary. =Statutory exemptions= The California state legislature has, on occasion, abrogated CEQA such that specific projects or types of projects could proceed without an EIR. One such abrogation occurred in October 2009, with the passage of a union-backed law exempting the proposed construction of Los Angeles Stadium from CEQA's requirements. The abrogation mooted an ongoing lawsuit, brought by eight residents of a neighboring city, challenging the validity of the developer's EIR. The developer had originally prepared an EIR for a commercial development on the site, then prepared a supplemental EIR to include a proposed 75,000 seat stadium situated within 3,000 feet of homes in that neighboring city; the plaintiffs argued that a single new EIR studying the entire project was required. State officials said the abrogation ended an abuse of CEQA by individuals seeking to obstruct the project; at the signing ceremony, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would \\"terminate the frivolous lawsuit.\\" A plaintiff in the lawsuit said the abrogation \\"opens up the door for other developers... to hire lobbyists... and get exemptions from the environmental laws.\\" An environmental lawyer said that the slow economy would probably encourage developers to seek more abrogations, as legislators become more eager to stimulate job growth. =Categorical exemptions= Several categorical exemptions for projects are listed under Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, Chapter 3, Article 19. These exemptions cover projects that do pose a significant impact to the environment and fit within the description of the several categories listed under Article 19. A common categorical exemption used by agencies is 15301 for maintenance of existing facilities. Since the project is already built, the project often has no significant new impacts. Agencies do not have to file any CEQA findings for categorically exempt projects. They can be legally challenged by the public on whether the project must undergo CEQA. The lead agency can file a Notice of Exemption (NOE) to trigger a 35-day statute of limitations period for legal challenge or, if no NOE is filed, a 180-day statute of limitations applies. =Negative Declaration (ND) / Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND)= After the initial study is completed, the lead agency can then determine if the project could have a significant impact on the environment. The lead agency must propose mitigation measures to reduce any impacts to less than significant \\"to the maximum extent feasible.\\" The lead agency then prepares a draft Negative Declaration (ND) or Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) and publishes the document for public review for at least 21 days. After comments are considered, the lead agency can either recirculate the ND/MND if public comments required the project scope to substantially change, or the lead agency can adopt the document. The Lead agency must file a Notice of Determination (NOD) after adopting the document with a 30-day statute of limitations for legal challenge. If the lead agency is presented with a fair argument that shows substantial evidence of the project having a significant environmental impact after mitigation measures are exhausted, the lead agency is required to prepare an Environmental Impact Report. Thus, in essence, an ND/MND may only be used to satisfy CEQA requirements for projects with no significant unmitigated adverse environmental impacts (ND) or for which all potentially significant adverse impacts have been \\"avoided, reduced or minimized\\" to below the threshold of significance (MND). If significant impacts remain, an EIR must be prepared and a Statement of Overriding Considerations are necessary. =Environmental Impact Report (EIR)= According to case law, the environmental impact report (EIR) is at \\"the heart of CEQA\\". An EIR serves to inform governmental agencies and the public of a project's environmental impacts. Further, an EIR is required to propose mitigations and alternatives which may reduce or avoid any significant adverse environmental impacts; as the EIR is considered the heart of CEQA, mitigation and alternatives are considered the heart of the EIR. One alternative that a lead agency must usually consider is the no project alternative, that is, cancellation of the project, with the future instead unfolding according to existing plans (i.e., the status quo). Among all the alternatives, the EIR identifies the environmentally superior alternative; if the environmentally superior alternative is the no project alternative, the EIR identifies the environmentally superior alternative among the other alternatives. The EIR process begins with the circulation of a Notice of Preparation (NOP) which informs the public, responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and the OPR that an EIR will be prepared for a given project. The NOP must include sufficient project description details and likely environmental effects such that agencies and public citizens can provide meaningful comments on the proposed project for analysis in the EIR. The NOP comment period is no shorter than 30 days. After preparation of the draft EIR, a Notice of Completion (NOC) must be submitted to the Office of Planning and Research which includes project location, location of review copies, and public comment review period information. The lead agency must provide public notice of the draft EIR at the same time it issues the NOC. This notice must include the location of any public meetings intended to solicit comments on the draft EIR. If the draft EIR is circulated through the State Clearinghouse, then the public comment period must be 45 days minimum. The lead agency must prepare a final EIR before approving the project. The contents of a final EIR are specified in ¬ß15132 of the CEQA guidelines, but responses to draft EIR comments are the focus of the document. The lead agency then certifies the final EIR and issues its findings. Should significant and unavoidable impacts remain after mitigation, a Statement of Overriding Considerations must be prepared. Finally, the lead agency may decide whether or how to approve or carry out the project at which time a notice of determination (NOD) must be filed within five days of approval. Appeal periods and litigation avenues remain after the NOD. Comparisons to similar laws Similar laws at the federal and state levels require environmental impact analysis before commencing major projects. =National Environmental Policy Act= NEPA, a United States federal statute passed the year before CEQA, is similar to CEQA in that both statutes set forth a policy of environmental protection, and a protocol by which all agencies in their respective jurisdictions make environmental protection part of their decision making process. NEPA is narrower in scope than CEQA. NEPA applies only to projects receiving federal funding or approval by federal agencies, while CEQA applies to projects receiving any form of state or local approval, permit, or oversight. Thus, development projects in California funded only by private sources and not requiring approval by a federal agency would be exempt from NEPA, but would likely be subject to CEQA. The environmental impact statement (EIS) required under NEPA and the EIR required under CEQA are similar documents, yet have some crucial differences. For example, under NEPA, an agency can list all reasonable alternatives and their impacts, then choose their preferred project without regard to the severity of its impacts, even if it is more harmful to the environment. Under CEQA, the lead agency is required to mitigate all \\"significant\\" adverse environmental impacts to \\"the maximum extent feasible\\" and can approve a project only if the agency adopts a Statement of Overriding Considerations detailing the specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations that outweigh the project's significant, unavoidable impacts. If a major federal project, or project using federal funds is seeking approval in California, its lead agency must prepare both an EIS and an EIR, but both can be combined into one document (since the EIS and EIR have the same elements for the most part). Said document, however, must be processed through both the CEQA and NEPA approval steps. =Laws in other states= As of 2005, fourteen states as well as the District of Columbia have CEQA-style laws requiring impacts be reported for projects. CEQA influenced many of these laws, and New York state's law used CEQA as a foundation. Connecticut's Environmental Policy Act (CEPA) is modeled on CEQA and requires lead agencies to prepare an Environmental Impact Evaluation (EIE) that is very similar in nature to California's EIR. The various state laws are not entirely similar to CEQA, as most only apply to public projects (rather than all public actions, like CEQA) and few have as rigorous review standards. Litigation : CEQA's broad scope and lack of clear thresholds often lead to litigation, both by groups that support development, and individuals and agencies opposing such development. CEQA plaintiffs such as community and environmental groups often challenge projects with negative declarations, on the grounds that EIRs should have been carried out. Litigation also occurs on the grounds that EIRs are too brief or overlooked possible impacts, as there are no guidelines for the length or content of the EIRs. Plaintiffs also sometimes accuse developers of a practice called piece-mealing, by which projects are analyzed incrementally by parts to make the environmental impacts appear smaller to the overseeing agency. CEQA plaintiffs succeeded on one such claim in June 2009, concerning an expansion of the Chevron Richmond Refinery, the largest employer in Richmond, California. The judge ruled that Chevron erred by defining the project inconsistently, and the city of Richmond erred in allowing Chevron to piece- meal its project, and in allowing Chevron to develop a mitigation plan after the project begins. The judge consequently ruled the EIR to be insufficient to meet CEQA's requirements, ordering the preparation of a new EIR covering the whole, accurately defined project before the refinery's expansion could proceed. =Settlements= Plaintiffs in CEQA lawsuits seek various forms of redress, such as amending the EIR, preparing a new EIR, agreeing to mitigation measures, or paying money to local agencies to offset environmental impacts. Criticisms CEQA lawsuits (and threats of CEQA lawsuits) are frequently used by groups that want to block a proposed project for reasons than its environmental impacts. Carol Galante, a professor of Affordable Housing and Urban Policy at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley, who served in the Obama Administration as the Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), stated that ‚ÄúIt (CEQA) has been abused in this state for 30 years by people who use it when it has nothing to do with an environmental reason, ... NIMBY-ism is connected to the fact that for everyone who owns their little piece of the dream, there's no reason to want development next door to them, CEQA gives them a tool to effectuate their interest ... We need to fundamentally rethink how the CEQA process works in this state.\\" CEQA has been used by residents in San Francisco and Los Angeles to attempt to block homeless shelters and affordable housing projects from being located in their neighborhoods. A 2015 study by Jennifer Hernandez and others at the environmental and land-use law firm Holland & Knight, looking at all CEQA lawsuits filed during the three-year period 2010-2012, found that less than 15% were filed by groups with prior records of environmental advocacy. (such as the Sierra Club) While environmental groups largely agree that building dense housing in urban areas (\\"infill development\\") is better for the environment than converting open space to new homes, 4 out of 5 CEQA lawsuits target infill development projects; only 20% of CEQA lawsuits target \\"greenfield\\" projects that would convert open space to housing. A report by the California Legislative Analyst's Office found that in the state's 10 largest cities, CEQA appeals delayed projects by an average of two and a half years. CEQA's reqirement that automobile congestion be considered as an \\"environmental impact\\" that must be mitigated has resulted in the law both preventing the creation of bicycle lanes on already existing streets, as well as allowing lawsuits challenging new bike lanes both before and even after they have passed environmental review and been created. In one case, anti-abortion activists filed a CEQA lawsuit to try to block a new tenant (Planned Parenthood) from using an already constructed office building in South San Francisco. They cited the noise caused by their own protests as the environmental impact requiring mitigation. This lawsuit delayed the new tenancy by at least 18 months. Labor unions file CEQA lawsuits against projects to try to force them to pay prevailing wage. Governor Jerry Brown, in an interview with UCLA's Blueprint magazine, commented on the use of CEQA for other than environmental reasons: \\"But it‚Äôs easier to build in Texas. It is. And maybe we could change that. But you know what? The trouble is the political climate, that's just kind of where we are. Very hard to ‚Äî you can‚Äôt change CEQA [the California Environmental Quality Act]. BP: Why not? JB: The unions won‚Äôt let you because they use it as a hammer to get project labor agreements.\\" See alsoCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency References Further reading Fulton, W; Shigley, P Guide to California Planning Third Edition, (2005) Point Arena, California * CEQA at 40: A look back, and ahead‚Äîmaterials from a conference held at UC Davis School of Law, November 4, 2011 * Cecily Talbert Barclay; Daniel J Curtin; Matthew S Gray California Land Use and Planning Law, (2012) Point Arena, California External links California Natural Resources Agency, CEQA site * Governor's Office of Planning and Research, CEQA site Environmental Quality Act, California United States state environmental legislation Environment of California 1970 in law 1970 in California 1970 in the environment Environmental impact in the United States ","title":"California Environmental Quality Act"},{"id":"1833625","text":"The Great Train Robbery is a bestselling 1975 historical novel written by Michael Crichton, his third novel under his own name and his thirteenth novel overall. Originally published in the USA by Alfred A. Knopf (then, a division of Random House), it is currently published by Avon, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. It is the story of the Great Gold Robbery of 1855, a massive gold heist, which takes place on a train travelling through Victorian- era England on 22 May 1855. Most of the book takes place in London. A 1978 film adaptation was written for the screen and directed by Michael Crichton. Plot In 1854, Edward Pierce, a charismatic and affluent \\"cracksman\\" or master thief, makes plans to steal a shipment of gold worth more than twelve thousand pounds being transported monthly from London to the Crimean War front. He faces enormous obstacles as the bank has taken strict precautions, including locking the gold in two custom-built safes, each with two locks, thus requiring a total of four keys to open. He recruits Robert Agar, a \\"screwsman\\" or specialist in copying keys, as an accomplice. To ensure his plan's success, Pierce spends more than a year in preparation. His first steps are fairly easy as he uses his wealth and social contacts to procure information on the security measures and locations of the keys. The bank's president, Edgar Trent, and its general manager, Henry Fowler, each possess a key. The other two are locked in a cabinet at the offices of the South Eastern Railway at the London Bridge terminus. Pierce's first target is Edgar Trent's key, but he has no clues or prior information on Trent's habits. Through painstaking surveillance, conversations with bank employees and a deliberately bungled pickpocketing attempt, Pierce deduces that Trent's key is kept at his mansion, but is still unable to learn the exact location. After learning that Trent is keen on ratting (a blood sport involving the betting on dogs killing rats,) Pierce succeeds in becoming acquainted with Trent and while visiting the Trent mansion feigns a romantic interest in Elizabeth Trent, Trent's plain twenty-nine-year-old daughter, who has had few suitors. While pretending to court Elizabeth, Pierce learns that the key is most likely located in the basement wine cellar. With the assistance of his longtime mistress, known only as \\"Miss Miriam\\" (who is also an actress,) and his loyal associate, a buck cabby named Barlow, Pierce and Agar successfully break into Trent's home and wine cellar by night and make a wax impression of the key. Henry Fowler contracts syphilis and, too embarrassed to seek medical attention, asks his friend Pierce, as a bachelor and sporting gentleman, to aid him in seeking a remedy: sleeping with a virgin. After supposedly making the necessary arrangements through a madam (actually \\"Miss Miriam\\") and charging Fowler the exorbitant price of one hundred fifty guineas for a night-time assignation with a twelve-year-old (the legal age of consent) \\"fresh,\\" Pierce and Agar are able to make an impression of Fowler's key, which he always carries with him around his neck but takes off and leaves with his clothes (at the request of his virgin) during the assignation. The most difficult keys to \\"wax\\" are the two keys at the train station. Pierce plans to copy them at night, but the presence of \\"crushers\\" (policemen) and \\"jacks\\" (security guards) forces him to recruit \\"Clean Willy\\" Williams, a \\"snakesman\\" or burglar able to slip inside buildings through small and cramped openings, who is currently incarcerated in the high-security and supposedly escape-proof Newgate Prison. Pierce sends a message through Willy's former mistress and assists Willy in escaping from Newgate while the public is distracted by a public execution outside the prison. After nursing Willy back to health from injuries received during the escape, the criminals succeed in making wax copies of the two keys at the railway station, completing the job with only seconds to spare before detection. Now possessing copies of all four keys, Pierce bribes Burgess, the poorly paid train guard who rides in the baggage van containing the safes. Agar is then able to perform a dry run of the theft on 17 February 1855, making sure that the copied keys work perfectly. Certain unexpected events over the next few months cause delays. Finally the actual robbery is scheduled for May 22nd, but Pierce's plans are again disrupted when \\"Clean Willy\\" suddenly turns \\"nose\\" (police informer). Pierce's cabby Barlow murders Willy before he can reveal the most crucial information, although Willy has told enough to cause Edward Harranby, a very senior Scotland Yard detective, to deduce that a major robbery is planned. Through careful manipulation of a \\"blower\\" (informant) Pierce diverts the police's attention to an alleged robbery of the transatlantic cable company's payroll in Greenwich, leaving the thieves free and clear to finally strike. On the eve of the Great Train Robbery, another unexpected development occurs: a new railway policy requires the baggage van doors to be locked from the outside and prohibits anyone except the guard from riding in the baggage van. Determined not to further delay the theft, Pierce smuggles Agar into the baggage van inside a coffin, then risks his life by climbing across the roof of the train during the journey. He unlocks the door from outside, thus allowing them to drop off the gold at a pre-arranged point. By the next day, much of England is in an uproar upon the discovery of the robbery, with every organisation involved in the gold shipment blaming each other, few leads as to the true culprits and no idea how it was done. The members of the gang drop out of sight. Eighteen months later, Agar's mistress, who has been caught in the act of robbing a drunk, informs on Agar to escape imprisonment. Agar, who has been arrested on an unrelated charge, turns \\"nose\\" after being threatened by Harranby with transportation to Australia. Pierce and Burgess are arrested at a prize- fighting event in Manchester, and all three are ultimately convicted. Pierce is sentenced to a long prison term, but escapes while being transported from court (presumably arranged by Miss Miriam and Barlow) and disappears. After Pierce's escape, conflicting reports indicate him, Miriam and Barlow spending the rest of their lives living in luxury, reportedly in various foreign cities. Burgess dies of cholera during his short prison term; Agar is transported to Australia, but prospers and passes away a wealthy man in 1902. Edgar Trent dies from a chest ailment in 1857, while Henry Fowler dies from \\"unknown causes\\" in 1858. Edward Harranby dies in 1879 after being kicked in the head by a horse he had been flogging. The final line of the novel reads, \\"The money from the Great Train Robbery was never recovered.\\" Characters Edward Pierce - professional burglar who poses as a gentleman amongst his upper-class acquaintances in Victorian England. Pierce is arguably one of the most mysterious characters found in Crichton's works as almost nothing is known about his background; indeed even his name is likely false as others also refer to him as \\"John Simms\\" along with other titles. Nonetheless, his actions and thoughts in the book consistently demonstrate a sharp intelligence and broad knowledge which far outstrips that of his fellow criminals; perhaps his greatest asset is an ability to easily navigate through both the British underworld and the aristocracy. Throughout the planning and the execution of the Great Train Robbery, Pierce is always cautious, never truly trusting anyone‚Äîthis caution is eventually justified as it is Agar, his closest accomplice, who finally sells him out. * Robert Agar - A twenty-six-year-old screwsman (criminal who is skilled with copying keys and picking locks) at the beginning of the novel, Agar is pivotal to the eventual success of the Great Train Robbery, though he is also largely responsible for the culprits' eventual capture. He is apparently very well-acquainted with many criminals and helps Pierce identify many persons of interest including the informant Chokee Bill as well as the snakesman Clean Willy. Though he becomes a police informant at the end of the book in hopes of avoiding transportation to Australia, the judge sends him there anyway and he dies a wealthy man. Michael Crichton depicts Robert Agar as Pierce's lackey with limited intelligence, though his real life counterpart actually masterminded much of the robbery and got away with minor punishment. * Clean Willy - generally acknowledged to be the best snakesman available in London although his skills were apparently inadequate to prevent arrest and incarceration (which occurred at least twice before and during the story). Edward Pierce goes to great expense to help Willy escape from a high-security prison for the sole purpose of enlisting the snakesman's aid in the train robbery. After successfully completing his tasks, Willy is paid off by Pierce and disappears for some time from the narrative before resurfacing as a police informant, almost jeopardizing the entire scheme. Ultimately he is garroted by Barlow in a boardinghouse. * Barlow - a violent thug and former mugger who serves Edward Pierce loyally as a cabby, although his services are also employed for other purposes, such as the murder of Clean Willy. He and Miss Miriam manage to elude capture by the authorities, eventually rescuing Pierce from the authorities before the trio completely disappears. * Miss Miriam - Edward Pierce's mistress who is generally regarded as highly attractive by other characters in the book. She is also a talented actress and plays rather brief though important roles in the execution of the train robbery (such as pretending Agar is her dead brother and distracting Mr. Fowler while Pierce unlocks the baggage car). In many ways, she and Pierce are very similar and well suited for each other: both are resourceful and possess the ability to mix with men and women of all classes. Background Crichton became aware of the story when lecturing at Cambridge University. He later read the transcripts of the court trial and started researching the historical period. Historical deviations The story is a fictionalised representation of the historical events that happened, although the setting can be considered quite accurate. The characters' names are changed in the novel; for example, the main protagonist William Pierce is changed to Edward Pierce and Edward Agar to Robert Agar. Crichton stated that he did not want to be constrained by what actually happened. The true story of the robbery can be found in David C. Hanrahan's book The First Great Train Robbery. Reception The New York Times called it \\"Mr Crichton's best thriller to date.\\" The Los Angeles Times described it as \\"marvellous fun.\\" The book was one of the biggest best selling novels in the US in 1975. Three audiobook versions have been released: * an abridged version read by Michael Cumpsty released on audio cassette in 1996 by Random House (). * two unabridged versions on CD, one read by Simon Prebble and released by Recorded Books, LLC in 2000 () and one read by Michael Kitchen and released by Brilliance Audio in 2015 (). Film adaptation The novel was later made into a 1979 film entitled The First Great Train Robbery directed by Crichton starring Sean Connery as Pierce, Donald Sutherland as Agar and Lesley-Anne Down as Miriam. Unlike the real incident, only Pierce is captured and tried and all of the protagonists are seen to escape to freedom after the trial. The film was nominated for Best Cinematography Award for the British Society of Cinematographers, and the film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture by the Edgar Allan Poe award by the Mystery Writers Association of America. The film score by Jerry Goldsmith was short, but a favourite in the composer's repertoire and an extended version of the music was released in 2004.

It is his third non-fiction book. Description Crichton owned several computers, and he wrote articles and computer programs in the programming language BASIC for Creative Computing magazine. He was inspired to write Electronic Life because so many of his friends would call him asking for advice on computers. The book was intended to introduce the idea of personal computers to a reader who might be faced with them at work or at home for the first time. It defined basic jargon and assured readers that they could master the machine when it inevitably arrived. Electronic Life is written as a glossary, with entries like \\"Afraid of Computers (everybody is)\\", \\"Buying a Computer\\", and \\"Computer Crime\\". Entries consist mainly of Crichton's musings on these topics, and few of the entries reflect any research. The computer crime entry, for example, is three pages long and contains only four hard facts‚Äîspecifically, that institutions were then losing $5 billion to $30 billion a year on computer crime, that Citibank processed $30 billion a day in customer transactions using computers, that American banks as a whole were moving $400 billion a year in the U.S., and that the Stanford public key code (not otherwise described) had been broken in 1982. No examples of computer crime are given, though by 1983 such accounts were appearing in the mainstream press, and dedicated books on the topic had been around for at least a decade. Some portions of the book are dated. On page 140, Crichton points out that if you ask your computer to compute 5.01*5.02-5.03/2.04*100.5+3.06+20.07-200.08+300.09/1.10, there will be a noticeable delay as it works out the answer. Later he suggests that a user would do well to buy a CP/M-based system, because of all the excellent applications for that platform. In the book, Crichton correctly predicts that computer networks would increase in importance. He saw this as a matter of convenience‚Äîcomputers can share pictures, which you can't do with a verbal phone call, and computer networks can operate asynchronously, so you can leave information for somebody and have them pick it up at their convenience. He also comments on games that are played on computers, saying \\"Arcade games are the hula hoops of the '80s, and already there are indications that the mania for twitch games (another name for arcade games) may be fading... However, unlike hula hoops, the present generation of computer games represents a transitional phenomenon on the way to a permanent alteration of our world. Computers are the most compelling toy ever invented ... Ever more elaborate and challenging games will be played on computers in the future. Why not? It's a way of making friends with the machine.\\"Crichton, Michael. Electronic Life: How to Think About Computers (Alfred A. Knopf. New York, 1983), p69. In a section called \\"Microprocessors, or how I flunked biostatistics at Harvard\\", Crichton lashes out at a medical school teacher who had given him a 'D' fifteen years earlier. Reception Jerry Pournelle named Electronic Life as his \\"book of the month\\" in BYTE in June 1985, writing that \\"Dr. Crichton has managed to pack a great deal of useful information, philosophy, and common sense into 250+ pages. Recommended for almost everyone; even experienced hackers will find parts interesting and can then keep the book around to lend to beginners\\".

It was originally discovered by Albert Hofmann but was not widely studied until the rise in popularity of psychedelics in the 1960s.  Effects  In Entry 26 of his compendium TiHKAL, which discussed LSD, chemist Alexander Shulgin touched briefly on the subject of ALD-52. His comments there are vague, second-hand accounts saying doses in the 50‚Äì175 ¬µg range have resulted in various conclusions. One account found that there was less visual distortion than with LSD and it seemed to produce less anxiety and tenseness and that it was somewhat less potent. Another informant claimed it was more effective in increasing blood pressure. Yet another informant could not tell them apart.  Safety  In The Hallucinogens by Hoffer and Osmond (1967), ALD-52 is listed as having a lower (approximately 1/5) intravenous toxicity (in rabbits), a lower (approximately 1/8) pyretogenic effect, an equal psychological effect in humans, and double the \\"antiserotonin\\" effect as compared with LSD. Human experiments have not been well documented.  History  The Orange Sunshine variety of LSD that was widely available in California through 1968 and 1969 was produced in the Sonoma County underground chemistry lab of Tim Scully and Nicholas Sand. It was shut down by the police, and Scully was arrested and prosecuted. This resulted in the first drug analogue trial, where Scully claimed that he and his partners did nothing illegal, because they were producing ALD-52, which was not an illicit drug. However, as the prosecution claimed, there were problems with such a rationale‚ÄîALD-52 was claimed to readily undergo hydrolysis to LSD, and secondly, the synthesis of ALD-52 required LSD. (The second point was based on the methods available in the scientific literature at the time). Scully was convicted and served time in prison. Tim Scully has confirmed that the speculation above is incorrect. In a Reddit AMA with the director of the movie The Sunshine Makers, he says \\"The Orange Sunshine we delivered was LSD 25. ALD 52 was an ill-advised desperate defense strategy that failed miserably... The story of Orange Sunshine is complicated by the fact that The Brotherhood distributed LSD from more than one manufacturer as Orange Sunshine. \\"Nick and I made the original Orange Sunshine in Windsor. That was the last lab I worked in making LSD. Ron Stark managed several LSD labs in Europe and most of his output was tableted and sold as Orange Sunshine. At least some of the LSD that his labs made was not pure.\\"  Legal status  ALD-52 = Austria = ALD-52 is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz √ñsterreich) as an analogue of LSD = Denmark = ALD-52 is not listed as an illegal substance in Denmark as of April, 2019, and its chemical class 'lysergamide' is not banned under the Analogue Act (Some LSD analogues are, however, prohibited). = Germany = ALD-52 is controlled under the NpSG as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized. = Latvia = ALD-52 is illegal in Latvia. Although it isn't officially scheduled, it is controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015. = Romania = 1P-LSD is illegal to produce or sell in Romania. It is not included directly in the list of controlled substances, but it is included in an analogue act. However, it is not, as of yet, classified as illegal to use. = Singapore = ALD-52 is a class A controlled drug, and is illegal to traffic, manufacture, import, export, possess, or consume in Singapore as of December 1, 2019, punishable with a minimum of five years‚Äô imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. = Switzerland = Since March 2018, ALD-52 is illegal in Switzerland and has been put in the RS 812.121.11. = United Kingdom = On June 10, 2014 the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that ALD-52 be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying it as ever having been sold or any harm associated with its use. The UK Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015 as part of The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2014. = United States = ALD-52 is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of LSD, a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or scientific research could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act.

The five ƒÅgamas together comprise the Suttapi·π≠aka of the early Buddhist schools, which had different recensions of each ƒÅgama. In the Pali Canon of the Theravada, the term nikƒÅya is used. The word ƒÅgama does not occur in this collection. Meaning In Buddhism, the term ƒÅgama is used to refer to a collection of discourses (Sanskrit: sutra; Pali: sutta) of the early Buddhist schools, which were preserved primarily in Chinese translation, with substantial material also surviving in Prakrit/Sanskrit and lesser but still significant amounts surviving in GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ and in Tibetan translation. These sutras correspond to the first four NikƒÅyas (and parts of the fifth) of the Sutta-Pitaka of the Pali Canon, which are also occasionally called ƒÅgamas. In this sense, ƒÅgama is a synonym for one of the meanings of nikƒÅya. The content of both collections, the ƒÅgama, here: Northern Collection, and the nikƒÅya, here: Southern Collection, are dissimilar to an extent. Large parts of the Anguttara nikƒÅya and Samyutta nikƒÅya do not occur in the ƒÅgama, and several sutras/suttas are dissimilar in content.Chizen Akanuma, The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese ƒÄgama & Pali NikƒÅya, Delhi 1929 Sometimes the word ƒÅgama is used to refer not to a specific scripture, but to a class of scripture. In this case, its meaning can also encompass the Sutta-pitaka, which the Theravada tradition holds to be the oldest and most historically accurate representation of the teachings of Gautama Buddha, together with the Vinaya- pitaka.The traditional Theravada view regarding the authenticity of the Pali Canon is contested by some modern scholars such as Brough (2001) whose own methodology involves triangulating the texts of the Pali Canon and the ƒÅgamas to make inferences about pre-sectarian texts. In the 4th century MahƒÅyƒÅna abhidharma work Abhidharmasamuccaya, ƒÄsa·πÖga refers to the collection which contains the Prakrit/Sanskrit ƒÅgamas as the ≈örƒÅvakapi·π≠aka, and associates it with the ≈õrƒÅvakas and pratyekabuddhas.Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching. 2001. pp. 199-200 ƒÄsa·πÖga classifies the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras as belonging to the Bodhisattvapi·π≠aka, which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas. History Jens-Uwe Hartmann writes,Hartmann, Jens-Uwe (2003). \\"Agamas\\", in Buswell, Robert E. ed.; Encyclopedia of Buddhism, New York: Macmillan Reference Lib. . Vol. 1, p. 10. It is clear that, among the early schools, at a minimum the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda, KƒÅ≈õyapƒ´ya, MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika, and Dharmaguptaka had recensions of four of the five Prakrit/Sanskrit ƒÅgamas that differed. The ƒÅgamas have been compared to the Pali Canon's nikƒÅyas by contemporary scholars in an attempt to identify possible changes and root phrasings. The ƒÅgamas' existence and similarity to the Sutta Pitaka are sometimes used by scholars to assess to what degree these teachings are a historically authentic representation of the Canon of Early Buddhism.See, e.g., Norman (1983), Brough (2001) and nandajoti (2004) regarding the authenticity of the Pali Canon's Dhammapada, Sutta Nipata and other texts when juxtaposed with other non-Pali early Buddhist texts. Sometimes also the differences between them are used to suggest an alternative meaning to the accepted meaning of a sutta in either of the two recensions. The various ƒÅgamas There are four extant collections of ƒÅgamas, and one for which we have only references and fragments (the K·π£udrakƒÅgama). The four extant collections are preserved in their entirety only in Chinese translation (ƒÅgama: ÈòøÂê´Á∂ì), although small portions of all four have recently been discovered in Sanskrit, and portions of four of the five ƒÅgamas are preserved in Tibetan.A Dictionary of Buddhism, by Damien Keown, Oxford University Press: 2004 The five ƒÄgamas are: =Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama= The Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama (\\"Long Discourses,\\" Ch√°ng Ah√°njƒ´ng Èï∑ÈòøÂê´Á∂ì Taish≈ç 1) corresponds to the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya of the Theravada school. A complete version of the Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama of the Dharmaguptaka (Ê≥ïËóèÈÉ®) school was done by Buddhaya≈õas (‰ΩõÈôÄËÄ∂Ëàç) and Zhu Fonian (Á´∫‰ΩõÂøµ) in the Late Qin dynasty (ÂæåÁß¶), dated to 413 CE. It contains 30 s≈´tras in contrast to the 34 suttas of the Theravadin Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya. A \\"very substantial\\" portion of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama survives in Sanskrit,Between the Empires: Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE by Patrick Olivelle. Oxford University Press, 2006 pg 356 and portions survive in Tibetan translation. =Madhyama ƒÄgama= The Madhyama ƒÄgama ( \\"Middle-length Discourses\\") corresponds to the Majjhima NikƒÅya of the Theravada school. A complete translation of the Madhyama ƒÄgama of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda school was done by Sa·πÉghadeva () in the Eastern Jin dynasty in 397-398 CE. The Madhyama ƒÄgama of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda school contains 222 s≈´tras, in contrast to the 152 suttas of the PƒÅli Majjhima NikƒÅya. Portions of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Madhyama ƒÄgama also survive in Tibetan translation. =Sa·πÉyukta ƒÄgama= The Sa·πÉyukta ƒÄgama (\\"Connected Discourses\\", Z√° Ah√°njƒ´ng ÈõúÈòøÂê´Á∂ì Taish≈ç 2.99)Muller, Charles. Digital Dictionary of Buddhism, entry on ÈòøÂê´Á∂ì corresponds to the Sa·πÉyutta NikƒÅya of the Theravada school. A Chinese translation of the complete Sa·πÉyukta ƒÄgama of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda (Ë™™‰∏ÄÂàáÊúâÈÉ®) school was done by Gu·πáabhadra (Ê±ÇÈÇ£Ë∑ãÈôÄÁæÖ) in the Song state (ÂÆã), dated to 435-443 CE. Portions of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Sa·πÉyukta ƒÄgama also survive in SanskritTripa·π≠hƒ´ 1962. and Tibetan translation. In 2014,The Collation and Annotation of Sa·πÉyuktƒÅgamaÔºà„Ää<ÈõúÈòøÂê´Á∂ì>Ê†°Èáã„Äã, Chinese versionÔºâ, written by Wang Jianwei and Jin Hui, was published in China. There is also an incomplete Chinese translation of the Sa·πÉyukta ƒÄgama (Âà•Ë≠ØÈõúÈòøÂê´Á∂ì Taish≈ç 100) of the KƒÅ≈õyapƒ´ya (È£≤ÂÖâÈÉ®) school by an unknown translator, from around the Three Qin (‰∏âÁß¶) period, 352-431 CE. A comparison of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin, KƒÅ≈õyapƒ´ya, and Theravadin texts reveals a considerable consistency of content, although each recension contains texts not found in the others. =Ekottara ƒÄgama= The Ekottara ƒÄgama (\\"Numbered Discourses,\\" Zƒìngyƒ´ Ah√°njƒ´ng, Â¢ûÂ£πÈòøÂê´Á∂ì Taish≈ç 125) corresponds to the Anguttara NikƒÅya of the Theravada school. A complete version of the Ekottara ƒÄgama was translated by Dharmanandi (ÊõáÊë©Èõ£Êèê) of the Fu Qin state (ËãªÁß¶), and edited by Gautama Sa·πÉghadeva in 397‚Äì398 CE. Some believed that it came from the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda school, but more recently the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch has been proposed as well. According to A.K. Warder, the Ekottara ƒÄgama references 250 PrƒÅtimok·π£a rules for monks, which agrees only with the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, which is also located in the Chinese Buddhist canon. He also views some of the doctrine as contradicting tenets of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school, and states that they agree with Dharmaguptaka views currently known. He therefore concludes that the extant Ekottara ƒÄgama is that of the Dharmaguptaka school.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 6 Of the four ƒÄgamas of the Sanskritic S≈´tra Pi·π≠aka in the Chinese Buddhist Canon, it is the one which differs most from the TheravƒÅdin version. The Ekottara ƒÄgama contains variants on such standard teachings as the Noble Eightfold Path. According to Keown, \\"there is considerable disparity between the PƒÅli and the [Chinese] versions, with more than two-thirds of the s≈´tras found in one but not the other compilation, which suggests that much of this portion of the S≈´tra Pi·π≠aka was not formed until a fairly late date.\\"Keown, Damien. A Dictionary of Buddhism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. =K·π£udraka ƒÄgama or K·π£udraka Pi·π≠aka= The K·π£udraka ƒÄgama (\\"Minor Collection\\") corresponds to the Khuddaka NikƒÅya, and existed in some schools. The Dharmaguptaka in particular, had a K·π£udraka ƒÄgama. The Chinese translation of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya provides a table of contents for the Dharmaguptaka recension of the K·π£udraka ƒÄgama, and fragments in Gandhari appear to have been found. Items from this ƒÄgama also survive in Tibetan and Chinese translation‚Äîfourteen texts, in the later case. Some schools, notably the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda, recognized only four ƒÄgamas‚Äîthey had a \\"K·π£udraka\\" which they did not consider to be an \\"ƒÄgama.\\" Others‚Äîincluding even the Dharmaguptaka, according to some contemporary scholars‚Äîpreferred to term it a \\"\\"K·π£udraka Pi·π≠aka.\\" As with its PƒÅ·∏∑i counterpart, the K·π£udraka ƒÄgama appears to have been a miscellany, and was perhaps never definitively established among many early schools. =Additional materials= In addition, there is a substantial quantity of ƒÅgama-style texts outside of the main collections. These are found in various sources: # Partial ƒÅgama collections and independent sutras within the Chinese canon. # Small groups of sutras or independent sutras within the Tibetan canon. # Sutras reconstructed from ancient manuscripts in Sanskrit, Gandhari, or other ancient Indic languages. # Passages and quotes from ƒÅgama sutras preserved within Mahayana Sutras, Abhidharma texts, later commentaries, and so on. # Isolated phrases preserved in inscriptions.

He was a leading figure in the movement to perform music on period instruments. Leonhardt professionally played many instruments, including the harpsichord, pipe organ, claviorganum (a combination of harpsichord and organ), clavichord, fortepiano and piano. He also conducted orchestras and choruses. Biography Gustav Leonhardt was born in 's-Graveland, North Holland and studied organ and harpsichord from 1947 to 1950 with Eduard M√ºller at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel. In 1950, he made his debut as a harpsichordist in Vienna, where he studied musicology. He was professor of harpsichord at the Academy of Music from 1952 to 1955 and at the Amsterdam Conservatory from 1954. He was also a church organist. Career Leonhardt performed and conducted a variety of solo, chamber, orchestral, operatic, and choral music from the Renaissance, Baroque and Classical periods. The many composers whose music he recorded as a harpsichordist, organist, clavichordist, fortepianist, chamber musician or conductor included Johann Sebastian Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Heinrich Biber, John Blow, Georg B√∂hm, William Byrd, Andr√© Campra, Fran√ßois Couperin, Louis Couperin, John Dowland, Jacques Duphly, Antoine Forqueray, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Johann Jakob Froberger, Orlando Gibbons, Andr√© Gr√©try, George Frideric Handel, Jacques-Martin Hotteterre, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Claudio Monteverdi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Georg Muffat, Johann Pachelbel, Henry Purcell, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Christian Ritter, Johann Rosenm√ºller, Domenico Scarlatti, Agostino Steffani, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Georg Philipp Telemann, Francisco Valls, Antonio Vivaldi, and Matthias Weckmann. Central to Leonhardt's career was Johann Sebastian Bach. Leonhardt first recorded music of the composer in the early 1950s, with recordings in 1953 of the Goldberg Variations and The Art of Fugue. The latter embodies the thesis he had published the previous year arguing that the work was intended for the keyboard, a conclusion now widely accepted. The recordings helped establish his reputation as a distinguished harpsichordist and Bach interpreter. In 1954 he led the Leonhardt Baroque Ensemble with the English countertenor Alfred Deller in a pioneering recording of two Bach cantatas. The Ensemble included his wife Marie Leonhardt (born 1928), Eduard Melkus (violins), Alice Harnoncourt-Hoffelner (violin, viola), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (cello) and Michel Piguet (oboe). In 1971, Leonhardt and Harnoncourt undertook the project of recording the complete Bach cantatas; the two conductors divided up the cantatas and recorded their assigned cantatas with their own ensembles. The project, the first cycle on period instruments, ended up taking nineteen years, from 1971 to 1990. In addition, Leonhardt recorded Bach's St Matthew Passion, Mass in B minor, Magnificat, and the complete secular cantatas, as well as the harpsichord concertos, Brandenburg concertos, and most of his chamber and keyboard music; he recorded Bach's Goldberg Variations (three times), Partitas (twice), The Art of Fugue (twice), The Well-Tempered Clavier, French Suites, English Suites (twice), Inventions and Sinfonias, and many other individual works for the harpsichord, clavichord, or organ. To the surprise of some of his associates,Rudolf Rausch, \\"Gustav Leonhardt\\" Ad Parnassum: A Journal of Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Instrumental Music 10(19) April 2012, p.194-196 Leonhardt accepted the role of Johann Sebastian Bach (played in a wig) in The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach, a 1968 film by Jean-Marie Straub and Dani√®le Huillet. Influence and awards The keyboardist, conductor and scholar John Butt said, \\"...there‚Äôs absolutely no doubting the enormous influence [Leonhardt] held over multiple generations of music making in the Baroque field\\"; in this discussion, Butt spoke of how much he learned from Leonhardt when preparing a chorus for him in the early 1990s. More generally, Leonhardt significantly influenced the technique and style of many harpsichordists through his teaching, editions, and recordings; his students and collaborators included harpsichordists and keyboard players such as Robert Hill, Bob van Asperen, John Butt, Lucy Carolan, Lisa Crawford, Alan Curtis, Richard Egarr, John Fesperman, John Gibbons, Pierre Hanta√Ø, Frederick Renz, Elaine Thornburgh, Ketil Haugsand, Siebe Henstra, Philippe Herreweghe, Christopher Hogwood, Ton Koopman, Karyl Louwenaar,Palmer, Larry, \\"Harpsichord Playing in America \\"after\\" Landowska\\" The Diapason June 2011: 19‚Äì21 p. 20.

Butt argues that Leonhardt's influence is not necessarily a simple, direct matter, but that some of his students consciously or unconsciously tried to play differently than he did. In comparing recordings of Bach's Goldberg Variations, Butt asserts that a \\"classic case\\" of the anxiety of influence is at work in the Goldberg recording by Ton Koopman, in which \\"what is immediately evident is the incessant ornamentation added to virtually every measure, often regardless of whether there is already obvious ornamentation in the notation.... my immediate reaction is often that this performance's principal message is 'Not Leonhardt'.\\"John Butt, \\"Bach Recordings since 1980: A Mirror of Historical Performance,\\" in Bach Perspectives 4, ed. David Schulenberg, University of Nebraska Press, 1999, p. 186, Similarly, he says that \\"Bob van Asperen takes [Leonhardt's] rhythmic subtlety to a new extreme and perhaps presents the most rhythmically nuanced account of the work [The Goldberg Variations], one that will be ideal to some and mannered to others.\\" By contrast, Butt argues, the younger Christophe Rousset plays the Goldberg Variations in a \\"meat-and- potatoes\\" manner with \\"a steady rhythm, even articulation, and a matter-of- fact presentation with little extra ornamentation,\\" demonstrating that \\"certainly Rousset does not seem to count among the 'radical reactivists' [to Leonhardt] such as Koopman and van Asperen.\\" Leonhardt served as a member of the jury for the triennial International Harpsichord Concours of the Musica Antiqua Bruges. He was the only jury member who had participated in all sixteen juries from 1965 to 2010. Among the awards given to him were the Medal of Honour for the Arts and Sciences from the Netherlands, presented to him by Queen Beatrix in 2009, and the 1980 Erasmus Prize, which he shared with Nicolaus Harnoncourt; it honored their recording of the complete Bach cantatas. (Leonhardt donated the money he received from the Erasmus Prize to Oudeszijds 100, an ecumenical Christian charity operating \\"in the red-light district [of] Amsterdam\\" that \\"addresses the issues of drug-addicts, prostitutes, refugees, and the homeless.\\").Gaetan Naulleau, \\"Gustav Leonhardt's Bach cantata recordings: project, reception and style,\\" Early Music (2014) 42 (1): 37‚Äì54, p. 51 Leonhardt was doctor honoris causa of the universities of Dallas, Amsterdam, Harvard, Metz and Padua. In 2007 he was made Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France and in 2008 Commander of the Order of the Crown in Belgium. Leonhardt gave his last public performance on 12 December 2011 at the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris. Thereafter he announced his retirement due to illness and cancelled all of his 2012 engagements. He died in Amsterdam on Monday, 16 January 2012, aged 83. Two asteroids were named after him: 9903 Leonhardt and 12637 Gustavleonhardt.  Collection  Gustav Leonhardt lived in a canal house on the Herengracht dating from about 1617, the Huis Bartolotti, and was a collector of decorative arts, paintings, and engravings. In 2014, his collection was auctioned by Sotheby's. His instruments were sold to a few former students, including Skip Semp√© and Pierre Hanta√Ø.

It is unusual in that it requires traffic on the freeway overpass (or underpass) to briefly drive on the opposite side of the road from what is customary for the jurisdiction. The crossover \\"X\\" sections can either be traffic-light intersections or one-side overpasses to travel above the opposite lanes without stopping, to allow nonstop traffic flow when relatively sparse traffic. Like the continuous flow intersection, the diverging diamond interchange allows for two-phase operation at all signalized intersections within the interchange. This is a significant improvement in safety, since no long turns (e.g. left turns where traffic drives on the right side of the road) must clear opposing traffic and all movements are discrete, with most controlled by traffic signals. Its at-grade variant can be seen as a two-leg continuous flow intersection.Gilbert Chlewicki: About History Additionally, the design can improve the efficiency of an interchange, as the lost time for various phases in the cycle can be redistributed as green time‚Äîthere are only two clearance intervals (the time for traffic signals to change from green to yellow to red) instead of the six or more found in other interchange designs. A diverging diamond can be constructed for limited cost, at an existing straight-line bridge, by building crisscross intersections outside the bridge ramps to switch traffic lanes before entering the bridge. The switchover lanes, each with 2 side ramps, introduce a new risk of drivers turning onto an empty, wrong-way, do-not-enter, exit lane and driving the wrong way down a freeway exit ramp to confront high-speed, oncoming traffic. Studies have analyzed various roadsigns to reduce similar driver errors. Diverging diamond roads have been used in France since the 1970s. However, the diverging diamond interchange was listed by Popular Science magazine as one of the best innovations in 2009 (engineering category) in \\"Best of What's New 2009\\". The design also is promoted as part of the Federal Highway Administration's Every Day Counts initiative which started in 2011.  History  Pictures from the first diverging diamond interchange in the United States, in Springfield, Missouri Top left: Traffic enters the interchange along Missouri Route 13 Top right: Traffic crosses over to the left side of the road Bottom left: Traffic crosses over Interstate 44 Bottom right:Traffic crosses back over to the right side of the road. Southbound approach to the I-44/Route 13 interchange in Springfield Prior to 2009, the only known diverging diamond interchanges were in France in the communities of Versailles (A13 at D182), Le Perreux-sur-Marne (A4 at N486) and Seclin (A1 at D549), all built in the 1970s. (The ramps of the first two have been reconfigured to accommodate ramps of other interchanges, but they continue to function as diverging diamond interchanges.) Despite the fact that such interchanges already existed, the idea for the DDI was \\"reinvented\\" around 2000, inspired by the former \\"synchronized split-phasing\\" type freeway- to-freeway interchanges. Examples of this type of interchange include the intersection of Interstate 95 and I-695 north of Baltimore (since reconfigured), and the intersection of I-20/59 and Interstate 65 in Birmingham, Alabama. In 2005, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) considered reconfiguring the existing interchange on Interstate 75 at U.S. Route 224 and State Route 15 west of Findlay as a diverging diamond interchange to improve traffic flow. Had it been constructed, it would have been the first DDI in the United States. By 2006, ODOT had reconsidered, instead adding lanes to the existing overpass. The Missouri Department of Transportation was the first US agency to construct one, in Springfield at the junction between I-44 and Missouri Route 13 (at ). Construction began the week of January 12, 2009, and the interchange opened on June 21, 2009. This interchange was a conversion of an existing standard diamond interchange, and used the existing bridge.https://web.archive.org/web/20191209163854/http://www.ijtte.com/uploads/2016-03-08/935be804-aeae-25eaIJTTE_Vol%206(1)_4.pdf In November 2016, the Delaware Department of Transportation completed the conversion of the DE-1 and DE-72 (Wrangle Hill Rd) overpass west of Delaware City, DE into a diverging diamond interchange. The interchange is viewable via live traffic camera on the DelDOT website. In December 2019, the Virginia Department of Transportation completed the conversion of the interchange at Courthouse Road and I-95 in Stafford, VA into a diverging diamond interchange. The first interchange in Canada opened on August 13, 2017, at Macleod Trail and 162 Avenue South in Calgary, Alberta. Followed by one in Regina, Saskatchewan the next year as part of the Regina Bypass project. The interchange in Seclin (at ) between the A1 and Route d'Avelin was somewhat more specialized than in the diagram at right: eastbound traffic on Route d'Avelin intending to enter the A1 northbound must keep left and cross the northernmost bridge before turning left to proceed north onto A1; eastbound traffic continuing east on Route d'Avelin must select a single center lane, merge with A1 traffic that is exiting to proceed east, and cross a center bridge. All westbound traffic that is continuing west or turning south onto A1 uses the southernmost bridge. Additional research was conducted by a partnership of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center and published by Ohio Section of the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The Federal Highway Administration released a publication titled \\"Alternative Intersections/Interchanges: Informational Report (AIIR)\\" with a chapter dedicated to this design.

Advantages  Two-phase signals with short cycle lengths, significantly reducing delay. * Reduced horizontal curvature reduces the risk of off-road crashes. * Increases the capacity of turning movements to and from the ramps. * Potentially reduces the number of lanes on the crossroad, minimizing space consumption. * Reduces the number of conflict points, thus theoretically improving safety. * Increases the capacity of an existing overpass or underpass, by removing the need for turn lanes. * Costs significantly less than a normal interchange.  Disadvantages  Drivers may not be familiar with configuration, particularly with regard to merging maneuvers along the opposite side of the roadway or the crossover flow of traffic. * Pedestrian (and other sidewalk- user) access requires at least four crosswalks (two to cross the two signalized lane crossover intersections, while two more cross the local road at each end of the interchange). This could be mitigated by signalizing all movements, without impacting the two-phase nature of the interchange‚Äôs signals. * Free-flowing traffic in both directions on the non-freeway road is impossible, as the signals cannot be green at both intersections for both directions simultaneously. * Highway bus stops are appropriately sited outside the interchange. * Allowing exiting traffic to re-enter the through road in the same direction requires leaving the interchange on the local road and turning around, e.g., via a median U-turn crossover. This affects several use cases:  Drivers who take the wrong exit  Bypassing a crash at the bridge  Allowing an oversize load to bypass a low bridge  Further considerations  No standards currently exist for this design * The design depends on site-specific conditions. * Additional signage, lighting, and pavement markings are needed beyond the levels for a standard diamond interchange. * Local road should be a low-speed facility, preferably under posted speed on the crossroad approach. However, this may be mitigated by utilizing a higher design speed for the crossing movements.  Double crossover merging interchange  3D computer generated DCMI DCMI traffic flow patterns A free- flowing interchange variant, patented in 2015, has received recent attention. Called the double crossover merging interchange (DCMI), it includes elements from the diverging diamond interchange, the tight diamond interchange, and the stack interchange. It eliminates the disadvantages of weaving and of merging into the outside lane from which the standard DDI variation suffers. A highway U-turn requires weaving, however. As of 2016, no such interchanges have been constructed.

It is caused by a failure of the hymen to perforate during fetal development. It is most often diagnosed in adolescent girls when menstrual blood accumulates in the vagina and sometimes also in the uterus. It is treated by surgical incision of the hymen. Signs and symptoms Affected newborns may present with acute urinary retention. In adolescent females, the most common symptoms of an imperforate hymen are cyclic pelvic pain and amenorrhea; other symptoms associated with hematocolpos include urinary retention, constipation, low back pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Other vaginal anomalies can have similar symptoms to an imperforate hymen. Vaginal atresia and a transverse vaginal septum require differentiation. A strong urge to defecate has been observed in a few women. =Complications= If untreated or unrecognized before puberty, an imperforate hymen can lead to peritonitis or endometriosis due to retrograde bleeding. Additionally, it can lead to mucometrocolpos (dilatation of the vaginal canal and uterus due to mucous buildup) or hematometrocolpos (dilatation due to buildup of menstrual fluid). Mucometrocolpos and hematocolpos can in turn cause urinary retention, constipation, and urinary tract infection. Pathophysiology An imperforate hymen is formed during fetal development when the sinovaginal bulbs fail to canalize with the rest of the vagina. Although some instances of familial occurrence have been reported, the condition's occurrence is mostly sporadic, and no genetic markers or mutations have been linked to its cause. Diagnosis An imperforate hymen is most often diagnosed in adolescent girls after the age of menarche with otherwise normal development. In adolescent girls of menarcheal age, the typical presentation of the condition is amennorhea and cyclic pelvic pain, indicative of hematocolpos secondary to vaginal obstruction. An imperforate hymen is usually visible on vaginal inspection as a bulging blue membrane. If hematocolpos is present, a mass is often palpable on abdominal or rectal examination. The diagnosis of an imperforate hymen is usually made based purely on the physical exam, although if necessary the diagnosis can be confirmed by transabdominal, transperineal or transrectal ultrasound. An imperforate hymen can also be diagnosed in newborn babies and it is occasionally detected on ultrasound scans of the foetus during pregnancy. In newborns the diagnosis is based on the findings of an abdominal or pelvic mass or a bulging hymen. Examination of the normal neonatal vagina usually reveals a track of mucus at the posterior commissure of the labia majora; an absence of mucus may indicate an imperforate hymen or another vaginal obstruction. A similar condition, cribriform hymen, is diagnosed when the hymen contains many minute openings. Management Before surgical intervention in adolescents, symptoms can be relieved by the combined oral contraceptive pill taken continuously to suppress the menstrual cycle or NSAIDs to relieve pain. Surgical treatment of the imperforate hymen by hymenotomy typically involves making cruciate incisions of the hymen, excising segments of hymen from their bases, and draining the vaginal canal and uterus. For affected girls who wish (or whose parents wish) to have their hymens preserved, surgical techniques to excise of a central flange of the hymen can be used. The timing of surgical hymen repair is controversial: some doctors believe it is best to intervene immediately after the neonatal period, while others believe that surgical repair should be delayed until puberty, when estrogenization is complete. Epidemiology Imperforate hymen is the most common vaginal obstruction of congenital origin. Estimates of the frequency of imperforate hymen vary from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 females.

Tropical fish are generally those fish found in aquatic tropical environments around the world, including both freshwater and saltwater species. Fishkeepers often keep tropical fish in freshwater and saltwater aquariums. The term \\"tropical fish\\" is not a taxonomic group, but rather is a general term for fish found in such environments, particularly those kept in aquariums. Aquarium fish Tropical fish is a term commonly used to refer to fish that are kept in heated aquariums. Freshwater tropical fish are more commonly kept than saltwater tropical fish due to the common availability of fresh water sources, such as tap water, whereas salt water is not commonly available and has to be recreated by using fresh water with sea salt additions. Salt water has to be monitored to maintain the correct salinity because of the effects of evaporation. Freshwater tropical aquariums can be maintained by simply topping up with fresh water. Tropical fish are popular choices for aquariums due to their often bright coloration, which typically derives from both pigmented cells and iridescent cells. Tropical fish may include wild-caught specimens, individuals born in captivity including lines selectively bred for special physical features, such as long fins, or particular colorations, such as albino. Some fish may be hybrids of more than one species.  Freshwater tropical fish  Most fish that are sold as tropical fish are freshwater species. Most species available are generally bred from fish farms in the far east and Florida where tropical temperatures make the commercial production more viable. Mass production of tropical fish from farms has led to many inexpensive fish available to aquarists. Tropical freshwater fish are the most popular group of fish because of the low price and ease of keeping in aquaria. Some species are difficult to breed in captivity and so are still sourced from the wild. These species are generally more expensive. Among the bred-in- captivity species, the most expensive freshwater species include arowanas and flowerhorn cichlids. Some male flowerhorns are sterile due to many cross breedings.  Saltwater tropical fish  Marine fish that are sold as tropical fish are generally sourced from the wild, usually from the coral reefs around the world. This is because only a few species of marine fish have been successfully bred in captivity with any regularity. The price of marine fish coupled with the difficulty in keeping them alive in aquaria makes them less of a popular choice for aquarists to keep. However, because of the more vivid colours, patterns and behaviour of marine fish compared to freshwater fish, they are still reasonably popular. The advances in filtration technology and increase in available knowledge on how to maintain marine fish as well as the increasing number of aquarium-bred species is seeing a gradual rise in their popularity. Coral reef tropical fish Many marine tropical fish, particularly those of interest to fishkeepers, are those that live among or in close relation to coral reefs. Coral reefs form complex ecosystems with tremendous biodiversity. Among ocean inhabitants, tropical fish stand out as particularly colorful. Hundreds of species can exist in a small area of a healthy reef, many of them hidden or well camouflaged. Reef fish have developed many ingenious specialisations adapted to survival on the reefs. Some recreational SCUBA divers keep lists of fish species they have observed while diving, especially in tropical marine environments. Coral reefs occupy less than 1% of the surface area of the world oceans,Corals and Coral Reefs - Smithsonian Institution yet they provide a home for 25% of all marine fish species. Reef habitats are a sharp contrast to the open water habitats that make up the other 99% of the world's oceans. However, loss and degradation of coral reef habitat, increasing pollution, and overfishing including the use of destructive fishing practices, are threatening the survival of the coral reefs and the associated reef fish.

He has released several solo albums since his first, eponymous album in 1968. Fisher composed the song \\"The Final Trawl\\", recorded on the album Windward Away, that several other groups and singers, including The Clancy Brothers, have also recorded. Starting in the mid-1970s, he produced four folk albums with Makem and Clancy. He also performed with them and other groups as a backup singer and guitarist. He hosted his own radio show on BBC Radio Scotland for almost three decades. Early life Archie Fisher was born in Glasgow on 23 October 1939 into a large singing family. His sister Cilla Fisher is also a professional singer, as was his late sister Ray. In 1960 he moved to Edinburgh and appeared regularly at \\"The Howff\\" folk club run by Roy Guest. In 1962 Ray and Archie released the single \\"Far Over the Forth\\" on the Topic Records label and appeared on the BBC Hootenanny programme. In 1965 the whole family released the album Traditional and New Songs from Scotland.  Career  In 1963 Fisher ran a weekly folk club at the Crown Bar in Edinburgh, there he met acoustic musicians Robin Williamson and Clive Palmer who were performing together as a traditional folk duo. Mike Heron later auditioned to play rhythm guitar and the trio became The Incredible String Band. =Edinburgh Folk Festival= By 1964 the Edinburgh Fringe could boast a folk festival in its own right. An album of the participants was released on Decca. It was called Edinburgh Folk Festival vol 2 and contained tracks by Ray Fisher, Archie Fisher, Anne Briggs and the Ian Campbell Folk Group (including Dave Swarbrick). Bert Jansch and Briggs performed together but this was never recorded. At an early stage Fisher recognised the power of Barbara Dickson's singing and in 1969 invited her to guest on his albums. His live act included 'All Around My Hat', later to become a hit for Steeleye Span. His song \\"Witch of the Westmorland\\" was recorded by Dickson in 1971 on her album From the Beggar's Mantle, by Fisher on The Man With a Rhyme in 1976, by Stan Rogers in 1979 and by Golden Bough in 1983. Comeback In 1983 Fisher started hosting the long-running BBC Radio Scotland folk programme Travelling Folk. He retired in April 2010, handing over presenting duties to fiddler Bruce MacGregor. He appeared as the lead guitarist on Tom Paxton's 1986 album, The Very Best of Tom Paxton, and performed with Tommy Makem and Liam Clancy on television, recordings and concert tours. He also produced the Irish duo's first four albums, Tommy Makem & Liam Clancy (1976), The Makem & Clancy Concert (1977), Two For The Early Dew (1978) and The Makem & Clancy Collection (1980). After Barbara Dickson achieved fame as an easy listening singer, it was many years before she sang folk songs again. When she did, Fisher was invited back to join her. Fisher has toured Canada and the US as a solo act as well as appearing with Garnet Rogers and with John Renbourn. His style of singing is very gentle and he avoids all electronic instruments. \\"Dark-Eyed Molly\\" has been recorded by Fairport Convention, Eva Cassidy, Stan Rogers and Sheena Wellington. \\"Lindsay\\" has been recorded by John Renbourn and has been a highlight at his live shows for years, while \\"Mountain Rain\\" has been recorded by Wizz Jones (along with John Renbourn on guitar). Fisher now lives in the south of Scotland. He was awarded an MBE in the New Year Honours List in 2006.

It has been abolished by New South Wales and South Australia. It was used in the Australian Senate from the 1984 federal election until the 2013 federal election. A form of GVT is used for some elections in Fiji. Every Australian jurisdiction that has introduced GVTs has ballot papers with two sections separated by a line. Voters may choose to vote either ‚Äúabove the line‚Äù or \\"below the line\\". By voting ‚Äúbelow the line‚Äù voters can rank each candidate individually by numbering all boxes. Voters can choose to vote for a group ticket by placing the number '1' in one of the ticket boxes above the line. The single number '1' selects a GVT from one group or party, and all preferences are then distributed according to the GVT. This leads to pre- election trading between parties on how each group will allocate later preferences to other groups and candidates. About 95% of voters vote above the line. The introduction of GVTs led to the establishment of a multitude of minor parties and the creation of preference deals between them, enabling one or more candidates within the group to receive sufficient preferences to achieve the requisite quota for election, especially in multi-member electoral divisions. Such preference deals were first arranged for the 1999 NSW election, which saw the Minor Party Alliance succeed in having three of its members elected. \\"Above the line\\" voting GVTs have been abolished for federal Senate elections and for elections in New South Wales and South Australia. They continue to be available in Victoria and Western Australia. In elections for the Australian Senate, the New South Wales Legislative Council and the South Australian Legislative Council, voters can express an order of preferences for parties by voting '1', '2' and so on in different boxes ‚Äúabove the line‚Äù. The scope of a number above the line is merely the list of candidates for each party. The party supplies a list of its candidates to the Australian Electoral Commission, New South Wales Electoral Commission or Electoral Commission of South Australia before the election. All three jurisdictions have limited optional preferential voting, which enables voters to number as many boxes as they choose, but those only apply to the registered party list. New South Wales changed \\"above the line\\" voting for Legislative Council before the 2003 NSW election to optional preferential voting. Parties are now required to submit a higher minimum number of qualified members. A candidate group for Legislative Council elections now requires at least 15 candidates to be eligible for an \\"above the line\\" box. Parties do not register group preference tickets and a single 1 in a group's box only preferences the candidates in the group. Voters wishing to preference multiple parties with an \\"above the line\\" vote can use lower preferences (\\"2\\", \\"3\\", and so on) in those parties' \\"above the line\\" boxes. The changes reduced the number of parties contesting elections and increased the difficulty for new small parties to be elected. History Voting is compulsory in all Australian jurisdictions for both houses of Parliament, and those of the Australian States. Complete preferences voting was the only option available for the Australian Senate and the upper houses of other jurisdictions, and still is \\"below the line\\" in Western Australian elections. With the use proportional representation and preferential voting, it was daunting for many voters to have to fill in scores of boxes on the ballot paper. Some voters would choose their early preferences and then vote for other candidates in the order they appeared on the ballot paperknown as a donkey vote; or fill in the form incorrectly, leading to an informal vote. To ease this task, the GVT option was introduced to permit voters to choose one party or group, and all the remaining squares were deemed to be filled in according to a registered party ticket. Group voting tickets were introduced for elections for the Australian Senate by the Hawke Labor Government to reduce the number of invalid votes by simplifying the voting system for the Senate. Under the new system a voter cast a valid vote if they placed a single mark above the line instead of the scores on a typical Senate ballot paper. It was first used at the 1984 federal election. For the Australian Senate, the rate of informal voting was reduced from around 9% before 1984, to around 3% under ‚Äúabove the line‚Äù GVT system. Group voting tickets were introduced in South Australia in 1985 in New South Wales and Western Australia in 1987 and in Victoria in 1988.Constitution (Proportional Representation) Bill Following the use of tactical preference tickets and the record number of minor parties contesting the 1999 NSW election for the New South Wales Legislative Council, a modified form of \\"above the line\\" voting was introduced for the 2003 NSW election, effectively abolishing the GVTs. Other changes to party registration processes also resulted in many fewer parties contesting NSW Legislative Council elections. Group voting tickets for the Senate were abolished in March 2016 in favour of optional preferential voting in time for the 2016 federal election. South Australia changed from group voting tickets to optional preferential voting before the 2018 South Australian election. Instructions for above the line votes are to mark '1' and then further preferences are optional. The effect of an above the line vote is now to vote for all candidates in a single group in order, and not to follow a GVT. Voters who vote below the line are instructed to provide at least 12 preferences as opposed to having to number all candidates, and with a savings provision to admit ballot papers which indicate at least 6 below the line preferences. Criticism Group voting tickets voting has been criticised because electors do not know, and have no practical way of finding out, where their preferences are being directed. All details are published in advance, both electronically and in a free booklet published by the Australian Electoral Commission or the appropriate State electoral commission. The booklets may be viewed at polling booths on request to the poll officials. However, such is the complexity of the information that it is unlikely that the average voter could easily determine the fate of their vote's preferences particularly, as some parties submit multiple allocations (e.g., 33% to one party, 66% to another, and so on), and the effects are integrally wound up in preference deals between other parties. Using GVTs, the potential for tactical voting by parties is greatly increased. Because voters are not usually aware of how a party's preferences are directed, GVTs have allowed minor parties with low support in the community to be elected almost exclusively on the preferences of other parties, for example, where small parties with very different views have agreed to exchange preferences, or where larger parties have sought to minimise votes for opponents with similar views. A notable case was the 1999 New South Wales state election when the Outdoor Recreation Party's Malcolm Jones was elected to the Legislative Council with a primary vote of 0.19%,Antony Green (2009-06-16). Antony Green's Election Blog: NSW Legislative Council and its new electoral system. Retrieved on 2009-09-12. or 0.042 of a quota. GVTs came under scrutiny at the 2013 Australian election for multiple candidates getting provisionally elected with the vast majority of the 14.3% quota being filled from preferences, with \\"preference whisperer\\" Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance organising tight cross-preferencing between minor parties.Glen Druery - the 'preference whisperer': ABC 21 August 2013 Ricky Muir from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party won a senate seat on a record-low primary vote of 0.5% in Victoria (previous record held by Family First's Steve Fielding in 2004 on 1.9% in Victoria). The Sports Party's Wayne Dropulich was on track for a period of time to win a Senate seat from 0.2% in Western Australia, coming 21st out of 28 groups. Family First's Bob Day won a seat on a primary vote of 3.8% in South Australia, and the DLP's John Madigan won his seat in 2010 on a primary vote of 2.3% in Victoria. Xenophon and larger parties including the government proposed changes to the GVT system.

He was one of the Competitors for the Crown of Scotland.  Succession  Said to be aged 47 at his father's death, Sir Patrick de Dunbar, Knight, Earl of Dunbar, had livery of his father's lands on 14 May 1290. It appears that this Earl of Dunbar assumed the additional alternate title Earl of March, as he appeared designated Comes de Marchia at the parliament at Birgham in 1290,Anderson (1867), vol.iv,p.74 for the purpose of betrothing the Princess Margaret to the son of King Edward I of England. (This failed to come about).  Ambition and submission  Patrick was one of the \\"seven earls of Scotland,\\" a distinct body separate from the other estates of the realm, who claimed the right to elect a king in cases of disputed succession. He was one of the Competitors for the Crown of Scotland in 1291, when he entered a formal claim in right of his great-grandmother, Ada, Countess of Dunbar, an illegitimate daughter of William The Lion, King of Scots.Anderson (1867), vol.iv, p.74 Like so many Scottish noblemen, including the Bruces, Dunbar held lands in England also which required knights' services, and he was summoned by King Edward I in 1294 to assist him at war in Gascony. Fealty, then disobedience The Earl of Dunbar and March, with the Earl of Angus, Robert Bruce the elder, and his son the Earl of Carrick, swore fealty to the English King at Wark on 25 March 1296. In this turbulent year he appears to have been betrayed by his wife, who took the Scottish side and retained the castle of Dunbar for Balliol, but was obliged to surrender it to King Edward I of England in April 1296. In 1297 it appears that the Earl ceased his allegiance to Edward I, held his lands of the Scottish Crown, and was favourably received by Sir William Wallace, with whom he had been in bitter battle the previous year. In 1298 he was King's Lieutenant for Scotland, and in 1300 was present at the siege of Caerlaverock Castle, with his eldest son and heir, Patrick.

Mechanism  The mine has a slightly domed pressure plate made from flexible plastic with a raised 6 spoke wagon wheel pattern on top. Type 72 has a telescopic carrying handle molded into the bottom of the mine and a large diameter filler plug on the side just above the handle position. The mine has a crimp around the top edge where the mine body meets the pressure plate. The mine contains 5.4 kg of 50:50 RDX/TNT and is actuated when pressure of 300 kg deforms the flexible plastic pressure plate long enough to release the cocked striker fuze. When the pressure plate is moved approximately 9 mm downwards it exerts pressure on the fuze. If fuzed with the T-72 clear plastic-cased blast resistant fuze, pressure on the top of the fuze will depress the casing which will revolve due to the depression of the spring which is attached to the casing. The revolution is controlled by lugs on the inner fuze assembly which fit in grooves in the fuze casing. When the fuze casing is revolved and depressed sufficiently, the two retaining balls to will fall away in groove in the outer casing, which releases the striker. The striker is driven down by the spring, initiating the detonator, which in turn initiates the booster and the main charge. The mine is blast resistant since rapid depression of the fuze will push the fuze casing straight down without any revolution. The lugs on the inner fuze assembly will then slide into vertical groves instead of the diagonal ones. The striker retaining balls will then be prevented from coming in line with the groves in the outer casing and the striker will not be released. Instead the pressure plate will bounce back into its original position.  Similar Landmines  Two similar plastic bodied AT mines manufactured in China are the Type 69 and the Type 81, although it is entirely possible that there is no difference between the Type 69, Type 72 and Type 81 mines other than their fuzes. The basic descriptions (dimensions, weights, appearance, colour) for Type 69 and Type 81 mines match the Type 72 very closely. The fuzes are all blast resistant and the mine name may only vary depending on the fuze used. Because of its low metal content, the Type 72 cannot be located using metal detectors under most field conditions. The Type 72 is resistant to shock and overpressure from explosive breaching systems such as the Giant Viper and MICLIC. A copy of the mine, the YM-III (sometimes YM-3), is produced in Iran. It is slightly heavier at 7 kg, with a slightly heavier 5.7 kg Composition B main charge, with a slightly higher activation pressure of 450 to 900 kg.

Background Said to be aged 35 in 1248,Richardson (2005) p.209 he was the son of Patrick II, Earl of Dunbar (by Eupheme de Brus), who was son of Patrick I, Earl of Dunbar, who was son of Waltheof, Earl of Dunbar, who was descendant in male line of Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. His successors controlled the marches, but the title Earl of March was only assumed by Patrick IV, Earl of March. Career Patrick did homage for his lands in England to King Henry III in 1249. The earl was part of the English faction who opposed the Comyns and in 1255 he and others procured the dismissal of the Comyns and their faction from power. The same year he was nominated Regent and Guardian of the King and Queen. In 1258 the Comyn's faction prevailed, and Earl Patrick was excluded from the government. In 1263 he founded a monastery for the Carmelites or White Friars in Dunbar; and led the left division of the Scottish army at the battle of Largs the same year.

Auel set circa 30,000 years before present. There are six novels in the series. Although Auel had previously mentioned in interviews that there would be a seventh novel, publicity announcements for the sixth confirmed it would be the final book in the sequence. The series is set in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic era, after the date of the first ceramics discovered, but before the last advance of glaciers. The books focus on the period of co- existence between Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals. As a whole, the series is a tale of personal discovery: coming-of-age, invention, cultural complexities, and, beginning with the second book, explicit romantic sex. It tells the story of Ayla, an orphaned Cro-Magnon girl who is adopted and raised by a tribe of Neanderthals and who later embarks on a journey to find the Others (her own kind), meeting along the way her romantic interest and supporting co- protagonist, Jondalar. The story arc in part comprises a travel tale, in which the two lovers journey from the region of Ukraine to Jondalar's home in what is now France, along an indirect route up the Danube River valley. In the third and fourth works, they meet various groups of Cro-Magnons and encounter their culture and technology. The couple finally return to southwestern France and Jondalar's people in the fifth novel. The series includes a highly detailed focus on botany, herbology, herbal medicine, archaeology and anthropology, but it also features substantial amounts of romance, coming-of- age crises, and‚Äîemploying significant literary license‚Äîthe attribution of certain advances and inventions to the protagonists. In addition, Auel's series incorporates a number of recent archeological and anthropological theories. It also suggested the notion of Sapiens-Neanderthal interbreeding. The author's treatment of unconventional sexual practices (which are central to her hypothesized nature-centered religions) and frequent explicit depictions of sex has earned the series a top twenty place on the American Library Association's list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990‚Äì1999.  The books  = The Clan of the Cave Bear = The first book, The Clan of the Cave Bear was released in September 1980 and is a story of personal development set in pre-historic southern Europe during the current Ice Age but before the last glacial period. It introduces the reader to a wide variety of diverse topics, including herbal medicine and anthropological- archeological reasoning. The book introduces Ayla, a young girl belonging to the titular clan who looks nothing like her peers, especially with her long, golden hair. = The Valley of Horses = The Valley of Horses was released in September 1982. Ayla, cast out of the Clan, has been forced to follow the advice given her in the first book by her dying foster-mother Iza. She goes in search of \\"the Others\\"‚Äîthat is, people like herself: European Cro-Magnon Homo sapiens, or early-modern humans, returned west and north to Europe after an incubation period of tens of millennia in the near and far east. = The Mammoth Hunters = The third book in the series, The Mammoth Hunters, was released in fall 1985. It details Ayla's personal growth as she learns to cope with a society of widely disparate individuals and their unpredictable behaviors, mysterious motivations, and habits. = The Plains of Passage = The Plains of Passage was released in November 1990. Ayla and Jondalar travel west, back to Zelandonii territory, encountering dangers from both nature and humans along the way. Her interactions often force the people around her to take a broader view and be more accepting of new ideas. = The Shelters of Stone = The Shelters of Stone was released on 30 April 2002. Ayla and Jondalar reach the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, Jondalar's home, and prepare to marry and have a child. Unfortunately, nothing is ever simple, especially for a woman with Ayla's background. = The Land of Painted Caves = The Land of Painted Caves, a sixth and final installment in the Earth Children's series was published on March 29, 2011. Author Jean M. Auel is quoted in September 2010 saying that in the book Ayla is now about 25 years old and training to become a spiritual leader of the Zelandonii. Her training includes a series of harrowing journeys.  The setting  Since the stories take place during the W√ºrm glaciation, populations are small in number and are surviving mostly in hunter-gatherer fashion. Prior to the discovery of metals, the primary materials used for tools are leather, wood, bone, horn, and flint. = People = In Auel's series, two cultures vie for resources, space, and survival: the Clan, which is what Neanderthals call themselves, and the Cro-Magnons (whom Ayla, with her Clan upbringing, generally refers to as \\"The Others\\"). The races are fairly different in culture, society and technology, but with some overlap: both depend on flint for their tools; both recognize the importance of fire and use it; both hunt and gather. Physiologically, the Clan are heavier and broader but also shorter than the people of The Others. They are very slow to embrace change and to innovate, and they still chase after animals to spear them directly, whereas the Cro-Magnons are enthusiastic about innovation and have moved on to projectile spears. The Clan's tools, clothing, and household implements are similarly less refined and sometimes less effective than those of their Cro-Magnon counterparts, whose implements and other goods are more technologically sophisticated. The Clan's reluctance to change is depicted by Auel as a function of their cognition; they are presented as dependent upon their racial-genetic memory. The average Clan child needs only be 'reminded' of a thing to know it permanently, though skilled tasks still require repetitive practice. Furthermore, the need to encode everything into a child's brain has increased the average Neanderthal head size to the point that, by the time of the first novel, women of the Clan are having trouble giving birth to their large-headed babies‚Äîa sign that their evolutionary strategy has run its course. The \\"Flatheads\\", as \\"The Others\\" pejoratively call the Neanderthals (owing to their distinctive back-sloping foreheads), also have a far more limited vocal repertoire than The Others, and largely communicate instead via a gestural sign language, although spoken words are sometimes used to add emphasis to the gestures. Auel describes this language as being quite nuanced, especially as bodily posture, facial expression and other physical actions ‚Äî in short, body language ‚Äî can expedite and expand upon the basic vocabulary of the hand signals. A Cro-Magnon observing Ayla demonstrating a translation characterizes the language as dancelike and elegant. For this reason, Clan members are highly adept at reading body language and cannot be deceived by lying; while one can spell an untruth with one's hands, one's posture will give it away. Consequently, the idea of telling an untruth is alien to Clan culture, a fact that Ayla needs time to conceptualize and understand. However, a Clan member can \\"refrain from mentioning\\" something she would prefer other people did not know, even though residual clues would probably reveal that something was being concealed. Cultural conventions, Auel suggests, would cause other Clan members to ignore the concealment out of sheer courtesy, though, again, Ayla has trouble grasping this concept. Finally, the wider Clan possesses not only a colloquial, everyday \\"localized\\" language, but also a more formal \\"ancient\\" or \\"spirit language,\\" used to converse with ancestors and understood by every Clan member, anywhere. This language facilitates easy communication at inter- regional meetings of normally separated groups and does not require the multilingualism that the Others must acquire. This \\"spirit language\\" has no spoken words apart from personal names, and its users generally refer to themselves in the third person. In Auel's context, our human ancestors, The Cro-Magnon \\"Others,\\" generally look upon the \\"Flatheads\\" as animals, hardly better than bears (the lack of vocal language is a primary factor in this verdict). The Clan, for their part, seem to have no strong opinions about the Others other than considering their spoken language as babbling and a sign of their lack of intellect. Otherwise, they have concluded it is best simply to avoid the Cro-Magnon men. Accurate to current DNA evidence, Auel depicts Cro- Magnons and Neanderthals as able to interbreed. The mixed-race children are generally not favorably regarded by either group. As in many historical cultures, malformed Clan children are routinely subjected to exposure, while the Others may allow such children to live but prejudicially label them as 'abominations'. Such children and their experiences enter the plotline in several books of the series. \\"Children of mixed spirits\\", as the Cro-Magnons call them, are mis-matched combinations of both Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal phenotypes physiologically as they are genetic hybrids, with some traits (like facial features) appearing blurred or distorted when compared side-by-side. Of the five mixed-race people depicted in the series, only one has had the restricted vocal range of the Clan (Rydag, from The Mammoth Hunters), and all but one has been seen using Clan sign language, the sole exception being the difficult and disconsolate self-loathing Brukeval (who is in clear psychological denial about his ancestry), in The Shelters of Stone.The vocal range of one of the mixed-race persons is as of yet unknown because she was only a baby when we meet her in The Clan of the Cave Bear. = Organization = \\"The Clan\\" is an overarching term; every Neanderthal is a member of the Clan. Organizationally, they live in smaller tribes, also called \\"clans\\" but named after the man who leads them; for instance, Ayla is adopted into Brun's clan. Later, when Brun steps down and, as is traditional, passes leadership of the clan on to the son of his mate, it becomes known as Broud's clan. Every seven years, Clans from the immediate area meet in a Clan Gathering; the only one Auel has depicted consisted of approximately 250 people. The Clan is mostly patriarchal: women cannot hunt, make hunting tools, lead a Clan or become a Mog-ur (a spiritual leader or shaman). But men cannot become medicine women, a job that is almost as prestigious as clan leader. Unlike other women, whose status depends on the status of their mates, a medicine woman has status in her own right and can, if her line is illustrious enough, even outrank the leader's mate. \\"The Earth Children\\" is an overarching term; their primary allegiances are to their people and their caves. Each culture has a name for itself (Zelandonii, for instance, means \\"Children of the Great Earth Mother who live in the Southwest\\") and may subdivide into smaller Caves or Camps (the Twenty-Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, the Lion Camp of the Mamutoi). Curiously, however, most Other culture names includes their word for Great Earth Mother: Doni in Zelandonii, Mut in Mamutoi (\\"Children of the Great Earth Mother who hunt Mammoths\\"), Gaea in Sungaea (translation unknown), etc. Their culture is far more egalitarian, with different twists and customs at every hand; Mamutoi Camps, for instance, are co-ruled by headmen and headwomen who are biological, or adoptive, siblings, and the Sharamudoi, a people that lives half-on and -off the Great Mother River, form complex co-mate systems between river couples (Ramudoi) and land couples (Shamudoi). Each entire people generally gathers for Summer Meetings every year, during which a number of important ceremonies, such as the Matrimonial, take place. = Religion = The Clan worships animal spirits, most notably Ursus the Cave Bear, for, as is related in one of the best known Clan legends, it was the Spirit of the Great Cave Bear that taught the Clan to wear fur, live in caves, and store up reserves during the seasons of abundance in order to survive the winter. The honoring of Ursus is what binds the Clan together as a people, and it is for this reason that the Bear Ceremony, and Feast of Ursus which follows it, held at the Clan Gathering are the highest religious rituals of the Clan. As described in Chapter 22 of Clan of the Cave Bear when Brun's clan chanced to see a living cave bear on their way to the Clan Gathering, \\"But it was more than the tremendous size of the animal that held the clan spellbound. This was Ursus, the personification of the Clan itself. He was their kin, and more, he embodied their very essence. His bones alone were so sacred they could ward off any evil. The kinship they felt was a spiritual tie, far more meaningful than any physical one. It was through his spirit that all clans were united into one and meaning was given to the Gathering they had traveled so far to attend. It was his essence that made them Clan, the Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" The Clan's animal spirits are always male. However, in the early days of the Clan, weather spirits such as Wind and Rain‚Äîspirits whose worship is so ancient that Creb had to use deep meditation to find them in the Clan memories‚Äîbore female names. Goov, Creb's apprentice, also speculates that Ayla's totem may be the Cave Lioness, rather than the Cave Lion, although this would be unprecedented in the Clan. In the ancient days when the weather spirits were honored, roles within the Clan had not yet become so markedly differentiated by sex‚Äîfor example, women still hunted alongside the men when they didn't have little children who needed their care. At this time, women were also the ones in charge of the spiritual life of the Clan. Because they once controlled access to the spirit world, and because the ceremonies involved begging the Clan spirits in what could be considered an unmanly fashion, Clan tradition holds that should a woman see one of the men's religious ceremonies, the clan in which this occurred would suffer disaster. When a ceremony invoking the weather spirits is held to sanction Ayla's hunting, especially strong protection was required for the men, both to guard against the presence of a female at the ceremony and because the ancient spirits were feared as much as they were honored in the days when they were worshiped. Ayla's subsequent accidental observation of one of the highest ceremonies at the Clan Gathering is interpreted by Creb to foretell doom for the entire Clan of the Cave Bear, as those ceremonies have meaning for all the clans of the Clan, even those not present at the Gathering. All Clan members are assigned a totem at birth, and boys are marked with that totem's ritual tattoo as part of the ceremony that marks their passage from child to man following their first major hunting kill. People are also believed to possess personality traits similar to those of their totem spirit; Broud, quick- tempered, stubborn and unpredictable like a woolly rhinoceros (his totem spirit) is a prime example. Totems are also responsible for pregnancy; a woman's moon time is believed to be her totem fighting off the presences of marauding male totems; for this reason, women's totems are almost invariably weaker than those of men and women may not associate with men during menstruation. Should the male totem prove stronger, the woman will become pregnant. If the totem is not strong enough by itself, it may ask for the help of one or more other totems, in which case it may be one of the other totems that leaves behind an impregnating essence. It is considered especially lucky for a boy to have the same totem as the mate of his mother. Totems are assigned by Mog-urs, men whose talent is understanding the world of spirits. Each individual Clan has its own Mog-ur, but one - the one in the clan which Ayla joins - is traditionally recognized as being first among them. The Clan also believe that, if someone survives a cave bear attack, it means that person is now under the protection of Ursus and may claim the Cave Bear as their totem, in addition to the totem they were assigned in early childhood. Unlike other Clan totems, there is no specific mark for the Cave Bear and the Cave Bear is believed not to play a role in the conception, although it may be called on to help subdue a woman's unusually strong totem. In \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", two people, Creb and a man injured by a cave bear at a Clan Gathering, are described as being \\"chosen\\" in this way. The Others worship the Great Earth Mother, and to some extent the Moon, her Fair Celestial Mate. The Great Earth Mother goes by many names, depending on the language, but is worshipped unconditionally as the source of all bounty, and carved depictions of her proliferate. Faith and guidance are administered by spiritual leaders of both sexes, with different names depending on the language. Among most of the peoples described, Those Who Serve abandon their personal names in favor of the name of their people and god. (The Mamutoi are the only depicted exception so far: only the Mamut of the Lion Camp, who is first amongst his priesthood due to his age and spiritual power, no longer uses any name but Mamut‚Äîmostly because no one remembers his original name!) To avoid confusion, among the Zelandonii they generally take appendices after their cave (e.g. Zelandoni of the Ninth Cave, First Acolyte to the Zelandonii of the Second Cave, etc.), leading Ayla to muse that they have traded their names for counting words, i.e. numbers. As with the Clan, one among Those Who Serve is generally acknowledged (or elected) First. = Sex and reproduction = Whether accurately or not, Auel has incorporated sex into her prehistoric culture in a number of unique ways. While neither Clan nor Other society requires monogamy, a major difference is that in the former, sex can be treated as a purely physical need, whereas in the latter, it is always imbued with something of the sacred. For the Others, nothing is more abhorrent than the idea of sex without consent, and sexual rituals form a significant part of their culture. Among the Clan, there exists a hand sign that only men can make and only women can receive, instructing the female in question to present for sexual intercourse. Any man of the Clan (a male who has made his first hunting kill) may give this instruction to any woman of the Clan (a female who has passed menarche), should he feel the need to \\"relieve his needs,\\" regardless of marital status. (The female's state of arousal is never addressed directly, but since Clan women are able to flirt with men using seductive and inviting body language, enjoyment of the act is not unknown.) Because the Clan believes babies are created by the Totems and have no concept of any connection between copulation and conception, lines of descent are matrilineal, but any children a man's mate bears are considered his heirs (especially in regards to the son of the leader's mate becoming the future leader), and he is expected to provide for her family and train her sons to hunt. Who is mated to whom is decided solely by the men, though wise leaders do of course take the prospective bride's feelings into account; the few Clans depicted average less than fifty members, and even one discordant pairing can cause trouble. Sexual maturity is the subject of semi-religious customs among the Others, both of which take place at Summer Meetings. Every year, women volunteer to become sexual tutors to boys who have reached maturity; the name of their office changes from culture to culture, but they are generally furnished with some distinguishing marking, often the Mother's sacred color red (red dye on the soles of the feet for the Mamutoi; a red fringe among the Zelandonii). These women are often pregnant by the end of the summer, which is believed to be the Great Earth Mother smiling upon their piety. Young women who have reached menarche, on the other hand, are the subject of a far more formal ceremony called First Rites, in which she is ritually deflowered by a man (often specially chosen by her friends and family). Both these relationships are meant to be solely physical, and social contact between the involved parties is frowned upon for at least a year afterwards. Finally, during \\"Mother Festivals\\" which take place at various times of the year, men and women are free to copulate with whomever they choose. Once again, these polygamous practices blur the lines of heredity, and descent is generally traced only through one's mother. However, certain familial resemblances have been noticed (for instance, Jondalar looks almost identical to Dalanar, his mother's spouse at the time of Jondalar's conception), which has led to the belief that the Great Earth Mother chooses the \\"spirit\\" or \\"essence\\" of a nearby man to impregnate the woman with. Ayla's more accurate belief that children are the result of sexual activity is treated with skepticism among the Others: their women are seldom celibate, which makes the connection between sex and pregnancy harder to isolate. Homosexual relationships are portrayed as acceptable, if rare. The Zelandonii religious order features at least one homosexual male with a male partner. A Mamutoi clan leader is openly bisexual. Many shamans are also portrayed as what would now be called third gender or non-binary, along with mention of a Mamutoi who in our modern terms is a trans woman.

The story follows Fiona Belli, a young woman who wakes up in the dungeon of a castle after being involved in a car accident. She quickly befriends a White Shepherd, Hewie, and begins to explore the castle with his aid to seek a means of escape and unravel the mysteries of it and its inhabitants. The game shares many similarities with Capcom's earlier survival horror title Clock Tower 3 (2002), and has been described as a spiritual successor to the Clock Tower series. The player controls Fiona as she explores the environment, evades and hides from enemy pursuers, and occasionally fights against the castle's inhabitants. Sometimes Fiona will panic when in danger, in which case she begins to run on her own and the player loses some control. Hewie is a central part to the gameplay, and accompanies Fiona throughout the game. He can be given orders to explore the environment, attack enemies, and otherwise aid in Fiona's survival. Capcom added the dog mechanic during development thinking retailers and players alike would not enjoy a survival horror title with a lone female protagonist. Haunting Ground was released April 2005 and received generally mixed reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The game's voyeuristic nature and the sexual objectification of Fiona were highlighted by critics as some of the game's best elements. They felt that by exposing Fiona as a vulnerable object of desire, the game makes her and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games. Gameplay Fiona escapes from Debilitas after ordering Hewie to attack him. Haunting Ground is a survival horror game with similar gameplay elements to Clock Tower 3 (2002). The player controls Fiona Belli directly and gives commands to her canine companion, Hewie. Fiona can run and perform a backstep maneuver, both of which reduce stamina. She can also crouch down to hide from enemy pursuers. Fiona can kick and tackle enemies as well, but tackling also reduces stamina. Losing too much stamina will result in Fiona becoming exhausted, causing her movements to slow down or possibly stop altogether. Exhaustion can be revived with certain items or with time. Fiona can interact with the environment by checking items, opening doors, and climbing ladders. The player can utilize hiding spots to evade pursuers. Other areas act as retaliation points that allow Fiona to use her environment to counterattack against her enemy, although some of these locations can only be used once. Commanding Hewie is an integral part of Haunting Ground's gameplay. At the beginning of the game, he won't be completely friendly and obey all of Fiona's commands. The player has to build a friendship and gain his trust in order to survive the game. Hewie can be told to sniff out items, check suspicious areas or items, attack an enemy, or called back to Fiona's side. The player can praise Hewie by petting and feeding him, both of which can heal his vitality. Likewise, he can be scolded when he won't listen to commands. He can be told to \\"stand ready\\" before attacking, which increases his attack power. Enemies can hear footsteps and other sounds. When Fiona is in a dangerous situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items can be used to calm her down. There are glowing orbs called \\"Luminescents\\", which will put Fiona in a state of panic and attract enemies to her. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms. Plot Fiona Belli is an 18-year-old girl who recently moved to college. While visiting her parents, she is involved in a car accident, and awakens in a cage in the dungeon of a castle. Her memories of the incident are hazy. Noting that the cage that keeps her prisoner has been left unlocked, she steps out and begins searching for answers and a way out of the castle. Soon after, she befriends a White Shepherd named Hewie. As Fiona begins to unravel the mystery in which she finds herself, she learns that she is the carrier of the Azoth, an alchemic element, which for unknown reasons is being sought by Riccardo, the castle's keeper. The first enemy Fiona encounters is Debilitas, a large, mentally disabled groundskeeper who thinks of Fiona as one of his dolls. Fiona learns from a mysterious man named Lorenzo, that to escape the castle, she needs a staff from the chapel. However, upon taking the staff, Debilitas corners Fiona and Hewie, forcing a confrontation. They defeat Debilitas, but soon find their next enemy, Daniella, an icy maid. Daniella covets Fiona's ability to smell, taste, touch, feel, and \\"experience pleasure.\\" She is especially jealous that Fiona can create life (via a fertile womb). Daniella is defeated when she is impaled with a shard from a ceiling window pane. The third villain is Riccardo, who wields a flintlock pistol. For the majority of the game, Riccardo keeps his face hidden under a hood. Upon revealing himself however, Fiona is shocked to see her dead father's face. Riccardo reveals that he and her father, Ugo, are clones. He murdered Ugo in the car accident as revenge for leaving the castle and marrying Fiona's mother. He plans to use Fiona (by means of her womb and use of her Azoth) to bring about his own rebirth, so that he may live forever. As they fight atop a water tower, Hewie rescues Fiona by attacking Riccardo, causing him to fall from the summit. The final enemy is Lorenzo, who seemed to be an ally, but who now menaces Fiona in several different forms. Fiona first meets him as an old, crippled man. He tells Fiona that Riccardo was always the problem child, and that he created both Riccardo and Ugo in an attempt to find a body with an Azoth which he could use to gain immortality. Ugo had the Azoth, but left the castle to marry Ayla. Now with Riccardo dead, Lorenzo believes that Fiona is his, so he can take the Azoth she inherited from her father. He chases after Fiona, but she is able to crush him in a rock press. However, she soon encounters a resurrected, youthful Lorenzo; the life energy he acquired from Riccardo's body has allowed him mastery over his own aging process. With the help of Hewie, Fiona causes Lorenzo to fall into a pit of lava. At this point, the castle begins to shake and collapse, and Lorenzo returns as a flaming skeleton. He chases Fiona as she heads for the exit, and attempts to block her escape, but as they reach the door, he finally dies, and Fiona and Hewie leave the castle. Development and release Concept art of Fiona. Critics would later point out her design as emphasizing her sexual attributes. Capcom began development knowing they wanted to make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. He took inspiration from Universal Monsters such as Frankenstein and Bela Lugosi's Dracula. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay. On September 24, 2004, Capcom debuted Haunting Ground under its Japanese name Demento at the Tokyo Game Show after launching a teaser page on their official website two days prior. The game was released in Japan on April 21, 2005, and later in PAL territories on April 29, and in North America on May 10. Critics described the game as a spiritual successor to the Clock Tower series, although it has never been officially declared as such. In July 2012, Haunting Ground appeared to be slated for a PlayStation 3 re-release as a \\"PS2 Classic\\", having been rated by the ESRB with Sony Computer Entertainment named as the publisher. On April 21, 2015, it was re-released for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Store exclusively in Japan. Reception Haunting Ground received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics were quick to compare it to the Clock Tower series, specifically its 2002 installment, Clock Tower 3 (2002). The defenseless heroine elements and hide-and-chase gameplay were found to be highly derivative of the former titles. The dog companion was, for some, a well-received addition to the gameplay formula, with Eurogamer's Kristan Reed comparing it positively to Ico. Others found the dog and other gameplay elements to be repetitive and contributors to poor pacing. The graphics, cinematics, and atmosphere were universally praised. The staff at 1UP.com described the environments as \\"some of the most detailed, lavish 3D environments Capcom has ever produced.\\" Kill Screen's Astrid Budgor compared Haunting Ground's \\"psychological landscape\\" to Dario Argento's film Suspiria (1977) and also highlighted its grotesque expressionism. Despite these highlights, critics ultimately felt that Haunting Ground was too predictable and relied heavily on clich√©s previously established in the horror genre. For this reason, Reed said it \\"becomes stifled by its own eventual lack of ambition to break away from the norms instilled by two generations of Japanese horror adventures.\\" The staff at 1UP.com felt the game was dated when compared with the recently released Resident Evil 4 (2005), but said, \\"Haunting Ground isn't without merit, it's just that the merits are buried deep in an occasionally thrilling, mostly 'been there, done that' game of indistinct origin.\\" Some critics highlighted Haunting Ground's sexual themes surrounding the objectification of Fiona as one of its best elements. Jeremy Dunham of IGN stated that \\"Haunting Ground's success comes from making the player feel like a desired and endangered object.\\" He found the plot was kept interesting due to the disturbing suggestive behaviors of Fiona's pursuers. Kill Screen's Budgor also found the drive for the enemies to kill Fiona creates a continuous tension, as its unclear nature lends to an uncomfortable confusion for both Fiona and the player. GameSetWatch's Leigh Alexander stated that \\"disparaging Haunting Ground for its copious objectification of women is a facile task...it‚Äôs precisely that off-putting sexuality that makes Daniela terrifying, that makes Fiona‚Äôs circumstances so explicitly repugnant, that sharpens Haunting Ground‚Äôs fear factor to a knife in the gut.\\" Alexander praised the game's voyeuristic themes and presenting of Fiona as \\"an object of desire.\\" She notes that \\"Fiona is both a sex object and a victim...a fragile little woman...both male and female players can distinctly feel the threat to her person, the disconcerting wickedness of her enemies, thanks to her overt sexualization throughout the game.\\" Budgor found that removing the player's control at critical points highlights Fiona's subjectivity, with the sounds and images expressing ideas of \\"violation, transgression, and bodily autonomy.\\" Alexander ultimately felt Haunting Ground to be a \\"perfect illustration of how sexuality can be used to great effect.\\" Legacy Haunting Ground has been a subject of game studies regarding the relationship between players and their avatars. It was found that the altering states of Fiona's subjectivity change the role of the player in the game. The player is never a spectator, nor do they take on the embodiment of Fiona, but float between these states of involvement. Fiona appeared as a character card in SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters DS (2006), and as a costume for Cammy in Street Fighter V. Fiona, Hewie and Debilitas were also seen in a cutscene in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars.

These demos are usually sent to record labels in hopes that the artist will be signed onto the label's roster and allowed to record a full-length album in a professional recording studio. However, large record labels usually ignore unsolicited demos that are sent to them by mail; artists generally must be more creative about getting the demos into the hands of the people who make decisions for the record company. Many signed bands and artists record demos of new songs before recording an album. The demos may allow the artist to provide sketches for sharing ideas with bandmates, or to explore several alternate versions of a song, or to quickly record many proto-songs before deciding which ones merit further development. Demos may include as few as one or two songs or as many as would be contained on a full-length album. Availability Demos are seldom heard by the public, although some artists do eventually release rough demos in compilation albums or box sets, such as the album Demolicious by Green Day. Other demo versions have been unofficially released as bootleg recordings, such as The Beatles' bootleg demos and the Beach Boys' Sea of Tunes series. Several artists have eventually made official releases of demo versions of their songs as albums or companion pieces to albums, such as Florence and the Machine (\\"What the Water Gave Me\\", among others) and Cults on the EP Sunday Jams. The event of a demo tape appearing on eBay has happened in the past, with the recordings being leaked onto the internet. In rare instances, a demo may end up as the final released recording of a song, as was the case with Foster the People's \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\". The version of \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" that was released as a single and subsequently became a hit was a demo recorded by frontman Mark Foster alone, before he had formed the group. In 1982, Bruce Springsteen recorded ten demo songs in his bedroom that he intended to later record with his E Street Band, but he subsequently decided that he preferred the acoustic demos and released them as the 1982 album Nebraska. In more underground forms of music, such as noise music, black metal, or punk, demos are often distributed by bands to fans as self-releases or sold at a very low price. Amateur (and some professional) musicians may choose to make demos available to interested listeners through websites such as SoundCloud or Bandcamp in order to share new ideas, receive feedback and/or provide fans with \\"behind the scenes\\" access to the songwriting process.

Written by Antonioni and Tonino Guerra, it was Antonioni's first color film. The story follows a troubled woman (Vitti) living in an industrial region of Northern Italy following a recent automobile accident. Il deserto rosso was awarded the Golden Lion at the 25th Venice Film Festival in 1964. It has received acclaim from critics. This was the last in a series of four films he made with Vitti between 1959 and 1964, preceded by L'Avventura (1960), La Notte (1961), and L'Eclisse (1962). Plot In Ravenna, Italy, Giuliana is walking with her young son, Valerio, towards the petrochemical plant managed by her husband, Ugo. Passing workers who are on strike, Giuliana nervously and impulsively purchases a half-eaten sandwich from one of the workers. They are surrounded by strange industrial structures and debris that create inhuman images and sounds. Inside the plant, Ugo is talking with a visiting business associate, Corrado Zeller, who is looking to recruit workers for an industrial operation in Patagonia, Argentina. Ugo and Corrado converse comfortably in the noisy factory. Ugo tells Corrado that his wife, Giuliana, had a recent auto accident, and though she was physically unhurt, she has not been right mentally. That night in their apartment, Giuliana becomes highly agitated and fearful over a dream she had about sinking in quicksand. Ugo is unable to calm her or understand what she's experiencing. Attracted to Giuliana, Corrado visits her at an empty shop she's planning to open and talks about his life and the restless nature of his existence. She accompanies him to Ferrara on one of his worker recruitment drives, and she indirectly reveals details about her mental state. She tells him that when she was in the hospital, she met a young woman patient who was advised by her doctors to find someone or something to love‚Äîa husband, a son, a job, even a dog. She speaks of the young woman feeling like there was \\"no ground beneath her, like she was sliding down a slope, sinking, always on the verge of drowning.\\" They travel to a radio observatory in Medicina, where Corrado hopes to recruit a top worker. Surrounded by cold industrial architecture, Giuliana seems lost in her loneliness and isolation. The following weekend, Giuliana, Ugo, and Corrado are walking beside a polluted estuary where they meet up with another couple, Max and Linda, and together they drive to a small riverside shack at Porto Corsini where they meet Emilia. They spend time in the shack engaged in trivial small talk filled with jokes, role-playing, and sexual innuendo. Giuliana seems to find temporary solace in these mindless distractions. A mysterious ship docks directly outside their shack, and as she looks out to the open sea, Giuliana confides to Corrado, \\"I can't look at the sea for long or I lose interest in what's happening on land.\\" During their conversations, Corrado and Giuliana have grown closer, and he shows interest and sympathy for her. Like Giuliana, Corrado is also alienated, but he is better adapted to and accepting of his environment, telling her, \\"You wonder what to look at; I wonder how to live.\\" When a doctor arrives to board the ship, Giuliana, seeing that the ship is now quarantined due to an infectious disease, rushes off in a state of panic. Her unwillingness to stay, or to return to the shack to retrieve the purse she left behind, underscores her state of alienation from the others. Sometime later, Ugo leaves on a business trip, and Giuliana spends more time with Corrado, revealing more about her anxieties. One day she discovers that her son has apparently become suddenly paralyzed from the waist down. Fearing he has contracted polio, Giuliana tries to comfort her son with a story about a young girl who lives on an island and swims off a beach at an isolated cove. The girl is at home with her surroundings, but after a mysterious sailing ship approaches offshore, all the rocks of the cove seem to come alive and sing to her in one voice. Soon after, Giuliana discovers to her shock that Valerio was only pretending to be paralyzed. Unable to imagine why her son would do such a cruel thing, Guiliana's sense of loneliness and isolation returns. Desperate to end her inner turmoil, Giuliana goes to Corrado's apartment where he tries to force his affections on her. Initially resisting Corrado's advances, Giuliana eventually accepts his affections, and the two make love in his bed. The intimacy, however, does little to relieve Giuliana's sense of isolation. The next day, a distraught Giuliana leaves Corrado and wanders to a dockside ship where she meets a foreign sailor and tries to communicate her feelings to him, but he cannot understand her words. Acknowledging the reality of her isolation, she says, \\"We are all separate.\\" At that point, Giuliana seems to be completely alone and at her lowest state. Sometime later, Giuliana is again walking with her son near her husband's plant. Valerio notices a nearby smokestack emitting poisonous yellow smoke and wonders if birds are being killed by the toxic emissions. Giuliana tells him that the birds have learned not to fly near the poisonous yellow smoke.

The cinematography is highlighted by pastel colors with flowing white smoke and fog. The sound design blends a foley of industrial and urban sounds with ghostly ship horns and an abstract electronic music score by Gelmetti. This was Antonioni's first colour film, which the director said he wanted to shoot like a painting on a canvas: As he would do in later film productions, Antonioni went to great lengths in reaching this goal, such as having trees and grass painted white or grey to fit his take on an urban landscape. Andrew Sarris called the red hued pipes and railings \\"the architecture of anxiety: the reds and blues exclaim as much as they explain\\". Another of Il deserto rosso's innovating technical effect is extentive use of the telephoto and zoom lenses, even in shots where the actor stands relatively close to the camera. Antonioni wrote \\"I worked a lot in il deserto rosso with the zoom lens to try and get two dimensional effect, to diminish the distance between people and objects, make them seem flattened against each other. Such flattening contributes to the sense of psychological oppression : Guiliana in several shots seems pinned against the wall and the bars between couples seem part of their body.\\" =Themes= Screenshot from the film: \\"My intention...\\" said Antonioni, \\"was to translate the poetry of the world, in which even factories can be beautiful.\\" Antonioni dismissed simple interpretations of the film as a condemnation of industrialism, saying: Critical reception In 1965, a reviewer for TIME lauded Red Desert as \\"at once the most beautiful, the most simple and the most daring film yet made by\\" Antonioni, and stated that the director \\"shows a painterly approach to each frame\\". It continues to be viewed favorably. In The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin wrote that Antonioni's \\"bold, modernist angles and thrillingly innovative use of colour (he painted trees and grass to tone with the industrial landscape) make every frame a work of art\\". Jonathan Rosenbaum praised the director's \\"eerie, memorable work with the industrial shapes and colors that surround [Giuliana]; she walks through a science fiction landscape dotted with structures that are both disorienting and full of possibilities.\\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker viewed the approach to color as \\"greatly responsible for the film‚Äôs emotional and intellectual power\\" and argued, \\"The characters in his movies seem thin because their environment is developed so thickly; yet that environment, he suggests, is, though exterior to them, an inextricable part of them.\\" References Citations Bibliography  * External links Red Desert: In This World an essay by Mark Le Fanu at the Criterion Collection Italian drama films Italian films Italian-language films Films directed by Michelangelo Antonioni 1964 films 1964 drama films Golden Lion winners Films shot in Sardinia Adultery in films Films with screenplays by Tonino Guerra Films produced by Angelo Rizzoli Films scored by Giovanni Fusco ","title":"Red Desert (film)"},{"id":"1833824","text":"Gregory Donovan Ostertag (born March 6, 1973) is an American retired professional basketball player. He spent most of his career with the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball at the University of Kansas. High school and college Ostertag starred at Duncanville High School in Duncanville, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. He averaged 22.5 points and 13 rebounds per game during his senior season,Houston Chronicle: \\"Big Guy Concerns North Shore\\" and capped the year by leading the Panthers to the 1991 state championship, the first-ever for the school's boys basketball team. After his successful high school career, Ostertag joined the basketball team at the University of Kansas. Standing 7-foot-2 and weighing 280 pounds, Ostertag provided a strong presence in the paint, helping the Jayhawks reach the NCAA Final Four in 1993. Statistically, his best season was his junior year (1993‚Äì94), when he averaged 10.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. Most impressive, he set a school record by blocking 97 shots that year. He graduated in 1995 with career totals of 968 points and 770 rebounds, along with 258 blocked shots ‚Äì the highest total in the history of Kansas and the Big 8 Conference at that time (since surpassed by Jeff Withey). Professional career The Utah Jazz selected Ostertag with the 28th pick in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft. The Jazz hoped he could fill a void in the team's defense created by the retirement of Mark Eaton a few seasons earlier. Ostertag saw limited action in his rookie year, but emerged as Utah's starting center during his second season. The Jazz made back-to-back appearances in the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, with Ostertag providing strong defense in the playoffs against the likes of Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Tim Duncan, and Shaquille O'NealLos Angeles Times: Even Ostertag Taking Shots at Shaq. Envisioning him as a potentially dominant defender in the future, the Jazz signed Ostertag to a long-term contract extension worth $39 million over six years. However, throughout the remainder of his career, Ostertag struggled with poor physical conditioning and inconsistent play, much to the chagrin of his coaches and teammates. Also, he constantly frustrated Jazz fans with his clumsiness and lack of skill on offense. Nevertheless, Ostertag made valuable contributions to the team on the defensive side of the floor, providing size and intimidation in the paint. He never played full starter-level minutes, thus hindering his overall statistical totals, but he was one of the most efficient shot-blockers in the league during his career. He led the NBA in blocked shot percentage twice (in 2000 and 2002)Greg Ostertag Profile at Basketball-Reference.com and was particularly good at gaining possession of the ball after blocking a shot.82games.com \\"A study of the value of blocked shots\\" Ostertag's contract expired in 2004, making him a free agent in the league. After nine seasons in Utah, he joined the Sacramento Kings. He played one year in Sacramento, before the Kings sent him back to Utah in a \\"mega- trade\\" that involved five teams and 13 players‚Äîthe largest trade in NBA history. Ostertag played one final season (2005-06) with the Jazz, seeing limited action. He played his final game on April 19‚Äîa home contest against the Golden State Warriors. Having previously announced his retirement, and that game being the last of the season, Ostertag received a standing ovation from Jazz fans.Deseret News: Fans give Ostertag a warm send-off He played 3:36 in the game, all in the first quarter. Fittingly, he blocked a shot and grabbed a rebound‚Äîand missed two free throws. The Jazz won the game, giving the team a final record of 41-41 for the year, ensuring that Ostertag retired having never played for a losing team for his entire NBA career.

Under Adolf Hitler, he opposed the nazification of the Protestant churches and their unification into the movement of the 'German Christians'. His post-war fame as a scholar rested on his effort to separate fiction from facts in his reconstruction of Jesus' life and in his subsequent treatment of the gospel of Matthew. His brother was the ecclesiastical historian and Luther scholar . Biography Bornkamm was a student of Rudolf Bultmann with Ernst K√§semann (T√ºbingen), Ernst Fuchs (Marburg) and Hans Conzelmann (G√∂ttingen). He developed his studies in T√ºbingen, Marburg and G√∂ttingen. In 1934 he was appointed professor at the University of K√∂nigsberg, but in 1937 the Nazis withdrew his venia legendi and he had to stop lecturing. He was a pastor in M√ºnster and Dortmund before he was forced, in 1943, to join the Wehrmacht. From 1947 to 1949 Bornkamm was a professor at the University of G√∂ttingen from 1949 to 1971 and professor of New Testament at the University of Heidelberg. He was also a member of the Confederation of K√∂ngener (Bund der K√∂ngener), a German youth organization created in 1920 out of groups of Protestant Bible circles and disbanded by the Nazi dictatorship in 1934. G√ºnther Bornkamm was a proponent of the Second Quest for the Historical Jesus (following the Period of \\"No Quest\\" of Albert Schweitzer). He suggested a tighter relationship between Jesus and the theology of the early church (in contrast to the 'First' and 'No Quest' periods ending in 1953). Numbered among his opponents, Rudolf Bultmann argued for a divorce between the two, but their approaches remain similar in many aspects. In his book Jesus von Nazareth (1956), Bornkamm expressed the profound difficulties of researching the historical Jesus and wished to produce a work that would inform not only professional theologians on the many questions, uncertainties, and findings of historical research, but also the laymen who would wish, so far as possible, to arrive at an historical understanding of the tradition about Jesus and should not be content with edifying or romantic portrayals. He also stated that everyone was so familiar with the Nazarene through Christian tradition, and yet at the same time this very tradition had become strange and unintelligible to many. He affirmed: > If the journey into this often misty country is to succeed, then the first > requirement is the readiness for free and frank questioning, and the > renunciation of an attitude which simply seeks the confirmation of its own > judgements arising from a background of belief or of unbelief. The work by Ernst K√§semann is also valuable for understanding Bornkamm's work.

Motilin is secreted by endocrine Mo cells (or M cells, these are not the same as the Microfold cells (M cells) that are in Peyer's patches) that are numerous in crypts of the small intestine, especially in the duodenum and jejunum. It is released into the general circulation in humans at about 100-min intervals during the inter-digestive state and is the most important factor in controlling the inter-digestive migrating contractions; and it also stimulates endogenous release of the endocrine pancreas. Based on amino acid sequence, motilin is unrelated to other hormones. Because of its ability to stimulate gastric activity, it was named \\"motilin\\". Apart from in humans, the motilin receptor has been identified in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs, rats, cows, and cats, and in the central nervous system of rabbits. Discovery Motilin was discovered by J.C. Brown when he introduced alkaline solution into duodena of dogs, which caused strong gastric contractions. Brown et al. predicted that alkali could either release stimulus to activate motor activity or prevent the secretion of inhibitory hormone. They isolated a polypeptide as a by-product from purification of secretin on carboxymethyl cellulose. They named this polypeptide \\"Motilin\\".  Structure  Motilin has 22 amino acids and molecular weight of 2698 Daltons. In extract from human gut and plasma, there are two basic forms of motilin. The first molecular form is the polypeptide of 22 amino acids. The second form, on the other hand, is larger and contains the same 22 amino acids as the first form but includes an additional carboxyl- terminus end. The sequences of amino acids of motilin is: Phe-Val-Pro-Ile-Phe- Thr-Tyr-Gly-Glu-Leu-Gln-Arg-Met-Gln-Glu-Lys-Glu-Arg-Asn-Lys-Gly-Gln. The structure and dynamics of the gastrointestinal peptide hormone motilin have been studied in the presence of isotropic q = 0.5 phospholipid bicelles. The NMR solution structure of the peptide in acidic bicelle solution was determined from 203 NOE-derived distance constraints and six backbone torsion angle constraints. Dynamic properties for the 13CŒ±‚Üí1H vector in Leu-10 were determined for motilin specifically labeled with 13C at this position by analysis of multiple-field relaxation data. The structure reveals an ordered alpha-helical conformation between Glu-9 and Lys-20. The N-terminus is also well structured with a turn resembling that of a classical beta-turn. The 13C dynamics clearly show that motilin tumbles slowly in solution, with a correlation time characteristic of a large object. Stimulus Control of motilin secretion is largely unknown, although some studies suggest that an alkaline pH in the duodenum stimulates its release. However, at low pH it inhibits gastric motor activity, whereas at high pH it has a stimulatory effect. Some studies in dogs have shown that motilin is released during fasting or interdigestive period, and intake of food during this period can prevent the secretion of motilin. Intravenous injection of glucose, which increases the release of insulin, is also found to inhibit cyclic elevation of plasma motilin. Other studies on dogs have also suggested that motilin acted as endogenous ligand in positive feedback mechanism to stimulate the release of more motilin.  Function  The main function of motilin is to increase the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulate the production of pepsin. Motilin is also called \\"housekeeper of the gut\\" because it improves peristalsis in the small intestine and clears out the gut to prepare for the next meal. A high level of motilin secreted between meals into the blood stimulates the contraction of the fundus and antrum and accelerates gastric emptying. It then contracts the gallbladder and increases the squeeze pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter. Other functions of motilin include increasing the release of pancreatic polypeptide and somatostatin. Motilin agonists Erythromycin and related antibiotics act as non-peptide motilin agonists, and are sometimes used for their ability to stimulate gastrointestinal motility. In the case of erythromycin, it is its hemiketal intermediate, formed after an oral dose in the low-pH environment of the stomach lumen, which directly acts on the motilin receptor. Administration of a low dose of erythromycin will induce peristalsis, which provides additional support for the conclusion that motilin secretion triggers this pattern of gastrointestinal motility, rather than results from it. However, some of erythromycin's properties, including antibiotic activity, are not appropriate for a drug designed for chronic use over a patient's lifetime. New motilin agonists are erythromycin-based; however, it may be that this class of drugs becomes redundant. Growth hormone secretagogue receptors share 52% of their DNA with motilin receptors, and agonists of these receptors, termed ghrelins, can bring about similar effects to motilin agonists. Camicinal is a Motilin agonist under development. Related peptides This domain is also found in ghrelin, a growth hormone secretagogue synthesised by endocrine cells in the stomach. Ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretagogue receptors in the pituitary. These receptors are distinct from the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptors, and, thus, provide a means of controlling pituitary growth hormone release by the gastrointestinal system. Erythromycin has an advantage over metoclopramide in gastric emptying due to lack of central nervous system side-effects. It is not approved by FDA to use for gastric emptying. For short duration for patients with diabetes and for those that must clear the stomach for any procedure, it may be used based on the physician's discretion with full understanding that it is not approved by FDA for this use.

Early life Born in England, she grew up in a conservative household. She moved to the United States at the age of 21. After moving to the United States, she had a successful career in the import business. While living in San Francisco, she became interested in acting and began studying drama. Career Parker was reportedly introduced to the adult film industry during the late 1970s by actor John Leslie, who suggested she take part in one of his upcoming films. She made her first appearance in 'V' ‚Äì The Hot One in a non-sex role. Soon afterwards, porn director Anthony Spinelli talked her into doing her first sex scene in Sex World (1977). Despite entering the adult film industry at an older age than most, she became a leading star in the field and was often paired with younger co-stars. Typically she was cast in mature women roles, such as mothers, step mothers, rich aunts and so on. She is best known for her role in the 1980 film Taboo. She retired from porn in the mid-'80s and for a time worked for Caballero Home Video as their public relations representative. She also appeared in small parts in several mainstream movies and televisions series, such as The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Later years In 2001, she wrote her autobiography titled Taboo: Sacred, Don't Touch: An Autobiographical Journey Spanning Six Thousand Years in which she wrote about her early childhood, her career in the adult industry, and her experiences with the metaphysical.

Microsoft attempted to minimise the deviations between standard C++ and Managed Extensions for C++, resulting in core differences between the two being syntactically obscured. MSVC++ 2003 and 2005 also provided support for writing programs in Managed C++. In 2004, Managed Extensions for C++ was deprecated in favor of C++/CLI, a second attempt by Microsoft at supporting programming for the Common Language Infrastructure using C++.  Design  Managed refers to managed code that it is run in, or managed by, the .NET virtual machine that functions as a sandbox for enhanced security in the form of more runtime checks, such as buffer overrun checks. Additionally, applications written in Managed C++ compile to CIL‚ÄîCommon Intermediate Language‚Äîand not directly to native CPU instructions like standard C++ applications do. Managed C++ code could inter-operate with any other language also targeted for the CLR such as C# and Visual Basic .NET as well as make use of features provided by the CLR such as garbage collection. This means Managed C++ occupies a unique position in the gallery of .NET languages. It is the only language that can communicate directly with .NET languages (such as C#, VB.NET) as well as native C++. The other .NET languages can only communicate with C++ code via PInvoke or COM. But since Managed C++ can communicate directly in both managed and standard C++ contexts, it is often used as a \\"bridge\\".  Functionality  Programs coded in Managed C++ provide additional functionality of the .NET Framework and the CLR. Most notable of these is garbage collection, which relieves the programmer of manual memory management. The garbage collector (GC) is handled by the CLR. Memory management is executed quite quickly, but for more performance critical applications, native, unmanaged code is most likely the preferred option. Managed C++ is geared towards object-oriented programming. A major difference between standard C++ and Managed C++ is that multiple inheritance is not supported, and a class managed under the CLR's garbage collector cannot inherit more than one class. This is because of a limitation of the CLR. Key features: * Extensible metadata: information provided to describe the structure and types of a managed component. It can be extended and reused to create software components. It is used heavily in C# and Visual Basic .NET * Garbage collection: the CLR is fully managed by a garbage collector for memory management automated by the CLR itself, i.e. the delete operator need not be called in managed C++ code. * Interoperability with .NET languages: code targeted for the .NET Framework produces Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL, similar to Java bytecode) output and thus, modules compiled and components (assemblies rather) can be reused by other program components written in another language targeting the .NET Framework, such as JScript .NET, C#, Visual Basic .NET and other 3rd party languages for .NET. * Versioning: new methods and data members can be introduced into existing managed classes without breaking binary compatibility with existing client side software. * Binary headers: allows reusing of precompiled metadata; any .exe, .dll, .obj or .netmodule compiled into MSIL can be referenced from a C++ source file. * Buffer overflow protection - with the introduction of garbage collection into C++, Managed C++ is less prone to the common buffer overflow errors caused by the absence of data type checking in standard C++. The garbage collector helps to reduce (not completely though) the frequency of these errors. * .NET framework Base Class Library - Managed C++ also has the potential to be less verbose than standard unmanaged code, since all managed function calls and inherited classes are derived from the .NET Framework Base Class Library (BCL, sometimes referred to as FCL or Framework Class Library), whose API provides TCP/IP networking capabilities, textual manipulation functions, data access (from ODBC to SQL), XML services (from XSD to XSL), GUI programming (Windows Forms), mail services (SMTP), cryptography (X509 Certificates and XML digital signatures), MSIL generation (essentially emitting instructions in MSIL), file I/O, manual manipulation of the CLR garbage collector and management information to manipulate the WMI console. = Advantages over native code = Managed and unmanaged code can be mixed together in the same CLI assembly seamlessly. This allows the programmer to keep unmanaged code that cannot be ported over to the .NET Framework without re-writing it completely. Some ramifications of using this hybrid convention are present though. * Managed C++ is the only language that can contain unmanaged code and natively communicate with all other .NET languages. Managed C++ is thus very convenient for interoperability between programmers who use different languages, including those in the .NET theater and those who use standard C++. = Disadvantages compared to unmanaged code = Managed C++ introduces a lot of new keywords and syntactic conventions that can impair the readability of code, especially if C++ code is included directly and interacts directly with Managed C++ code in the same assembly. * Managed C++ is superseded by C++/CLI and thus obsolete as C++/CLI has been standardized. = Disadvantages compared to fully managed code = Managed C++ requires a slightly longer development time than other .NET languages that could be applied to projects that still produce the same results. The use of pointers may or may not be a requirement, because managed C++ has both value types (__value struct and __value class) and reference types (__gc struct and __gc class). * Managed C++ fully support ASP.NET web applications, even though the development is more difficult than with other .NET languages, including some other third party languages. * Managed C++ includes only support for templates (for interoperability with native C++) but no support for generics (for interoperability with all the other .NET languages). C++/CLI supports both templates (at compile time) and generics (at run time).  Examples  The following examples depict the use of Managed C++ as compared to standard C++: *(Global change) Existing C++ to be ported over the CLR must be appended with the following: //hello.cpp //new using directive #using //another using namespace directive. using namespace System; int main() { Console::WriteLine(\\"Hello, world!\\"); return 0; } A new preprocessor directive #using is required. In addition to that, more #using directives are required to import more libraries to use more namespaces in the Base Class Library, such as #using and using namespace System::Windows::Forms; to use Windows Forms. *To compile code to target the CLR, a new compiler option must be introduced. cl.exe hello.cpp /clr /clr enables any code referencing the .NET Framework to be compiled as CIL. *A class can be designated to be garbage collected via the \`__gc\` extension keyword. //gc.cpp #using __gc class gc { int* i; char* g; float* j; }; int main() { while (true) { gc^ _gc = gcnew gc(); } return 0; } The preceding code can be compiled and executed without any fear of memory leaks. Because class \`gc\` is managed under the garbage collector, there is no need to call the \`delete\` operator. To achieve the same with unmanaged code, the \`delete\` keyword is required: //nogc.cpp class gc { int* i; char* g; float* j; }; int main() { while (true) { gc* _gc = new gc(); delete _gc; } return 0; } Notes: *A __gc designated class can have a constructor declared. *A __gc designated class can have a destructor declared. *A __gc designated class cannot inherit more than one class. (This is a limitation of the CLR) *A __gc designated class cannot inherit another class that is not __gc designated. *A __gc designated class cannot be inherited by another class that is not __gc designated. *A __gc designated class can implement any number of __gc interfaces. *A __gc designated class cannot implement an unmanaged interface. *A __gc designated class is by default not made visible outside of its own assembly. Use public __gc class hey { }; the public keyword to modify the access of the a __gc designated class. A __gc designated class can be destroyed manually using the delete keyword, but only if the __gc designated class has a user-defined destructor. *An interface can be declared with the __gc extension keyword preceding it. Such as: //interface.cpp #using __gc __interface ClassBase { void Init(); int Common(); } The preceding code must be compiled with /clr and /LD to produce a simple DLL file. Notes: *A __gc __interface cannot contain any data members, static members, nested class declarations and no access specifiers. *A __gc __interface can only inherit from another __gc __interface interface or the System::Object. Inheritance from System::Object is the default behavior. *A __gc __interface cannot contain any implementation (body code) of its declared function prototypes.  Comparison with other languages  The following contains main points and programmatic standards that differ between Managed C++ and other well known programming languages that are similar in concept. = Standard C++ = Disadvantages *native C++ code may be faster at runtime. *C++ does not require an installation of an associated compiler and managed runtime environment on the target system *C++ supports generic programming. Until the final release of C++/CLI however, Managed C++ programmers must revert for workarounds for using generics. *C++ supports the keyword \\"const\\" and const correctness. Managed C++, like Java and C#, does not contain this feature. An alternative is to make a managed class immutable, or restricting set accessors on public interfaces. *C++ code is not constricted by the CLR's restrictions. For example, the CLR does not allow classes to inherit other classes privately nor protected, thus the following will produce a compiler error: public __gc class one { int i; }; public __gc class two: private one { int h; i = h; }; // error public __gc class three: protected one { int h; i=h;}; // error *Managed C++ __gc classes cannot inherit from more than one class, as such the following will produce a compiler error: __gc class a {}; __gc class b {}; __gc class c: public a, public b {}; //will produce an error Advantages *Managed C++ supports a greater degree of reflection than regular C++, which is generally much more convenient depending on the function of the code, or what the code is intended for. *Managed C++ can inter-operate with all other .NET capable languages, including other third party languages. *Managed C++ is garbage collected. In standard C++, memory management and allocation is the responsibility of the programmer. = Java = Differences *Running Java code requires an appropriate virtual machine, while running Managed C++ code requires an appropriate implementation of the .NET Framework. Disadvantages *Java provides a documentation on the source code, while Managed C++ does not. *Java has many other development tools available for Java programmers to use, while Managed C++ is only available under Visual Studio .NET. Advantages *Managed C++ can access the computer system on a low level interface much more easily than Java. Java programmers must use the JNI (Java Native Interface) to use low level services of the host operating system. = C# = Differences *While C# supports pointers just as in C++, this feature is turned off by default. Disadvantages *Like Java, C# is syntactically simpler when dealing with managed code. *C# can achieve basically the same result as Managed C++, as all syntactic and structural conventions remain strikingly similar. *Managed C++, though it is a strongly typed language due to its introduction into the CLR, can be prone to errors if unmanaged compiled code is introduced in the same codebase, while C# is pure MSIL. Advantages *C# must use the .NET Framework and provided class libraries to access the computer system on a low level. *Porting over applications to the .NET Framework from C or C++ is much easier to do using Managed C++. *The Microsoft Visual C++ .NET compiler, which compiles Managed C++ to target the .NET Framework, produces a much more matured set of instructions in its resultant assembly, thus improving performance.

Such systems occur as the general form of (systems of) differential equations for vector‚Äìvalued functions x in one independent variable t, ::F(\\\\dot x(t),\\\\, x(t),\\\\,t)=0 where x:[a,b]\\\\to\\\\R^n is a vector of dependent variables x(t)=(x_1(t),\\\\dots,x_n(t)) and the system has as many equations, F=(F_1,\\\\dots,F_n):\\\\R^{2n+1}\\\\to\\\\R^n. They are distinct from ordinary differential equation (ODE) in that a DAE is not completely solvable for the derivatives of all components of the function x because these may not all appear (i.e. some equations are algebraic); technically the distinction between an implicit ODE system [that may be rendered explicit] and a DAE system is that the Jacobian matrix \\\\frac{\\\\partial F(u, v, t)}{\\\\partial u} is a singular matrix for a DAE system. This distinction between ODEs and DAEs is made because DAEs have different characteristics and are generally more difficult to solve. In practical terms, the distinction between DAEs and ODEs is often that the solution of a DAE system depends on the derivatives of the input signal and not just the signal itself as in the case of ODEs; this issue is commonly encountered in systems with hysteresis, such as the Schmitt trigger., pp. 529-531 This difference is more clearly visible if the system may be rewritten so that instead of x we consider a pair (x,y) of vectors of dependent variables and the DAE has the form ::\\\\begin{align}\\\\dot x(t)&=f(x(t),y(t),t),\\\\\\\\\\\\0&=g(x(t),y(t),t).\\\\end{align} :where x(t)\\\\in\\\\R^n, y(t)\\\\in\\\\R^m, f:\\\\R^{n+m+1}\\\\to\\\\R^n and g:\\\\R^{n+m+1}\\\\to\\\\R^m. A DAE system of this form is called semi-explicit. Every solution of the second half g of the equation defines a unique direction for x via the first half f of the equations, while the direction for y is arbitrary. But not every point (x,y,t) is a solution of g. The variables in x and the first half f of the equations get the attribute differential. The components of y and the second half g of the equations are called the algebraic variables or equations of the system. [The term algebraic in the context of DAEs only means free of derivatives and is not related to (abstract) algebra.] The solution of a DAE consists of two parts, first the search for consistent initial values and second the computation of a trajectory. To find consistent initial values it is often necessary to consider the derivatives of some of the component functions of the DAE. The highest order of a derivative that is necessary for this process is called the differentiation index. The equations derived in computing the index and consistent initial values may also be of use in the computation of the trajectory. A semi-explicit DAE system can be converted to an implicit one by decreasing the differentiation index by one, and vice versa.Ascher and Petzold, p. 234  Other forms of DAEs  The distinction of DAEs to ODEs becomes apparent if some of the dependent variables occur without their derivatives. The vector of dependent variables may then be written as pair (x,y) and the system of differential equations of the DAE appears in the form :: F\\\\left(\\\\dot x, x, y, t\\\\right) = 0 where * x, a vector in \\\\R^n, are dependent variables for which derivatives are present (differential variables), * y, a vector in \\\\R^m, are dependent variables for which no derivatives are present (algebraic variables), * t, a scalar (usually time) is an independent variable. * F is a vector of n+m functions that involve subsets of these n+m+1 variables and n derivatives. As a whole, the set of DAEs is a function :: F: \\\\R^{(2n+m+1)} \\\\to \\\\R^{(n+m)}. Initial conditions must be a solution of the system of equations of the form :: F\\\\left(\\\\dot x(t_0),\\\\, x(t_0), y(t_0), t_0 \\\\right) = 0.  Examples  The behaviour of a pendulum of length L with center in (0,0) in Cartesian coordinates (x,y) is described by the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\dot x&=u,&\\\\dot y&=v,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot u&=\\\\lambda x,&\\\\dot v&=\\\\lambda y-g,\\\\\\\\\\\\ x^2+y^2&=L^2, \\\\end{align} where \\\\lambda is a Lagrange multiplier. The momentum variables u and v should be constrained by the law of conservation of energy and their direction should point along the circle. Neither condition is explicit in those equations. Differentiation of the last equation leads to ::\\\\begin{align} &&\\\\dot x\\\\,x+\\\\dot y\\\\,y&=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow&& u\\\\,x+v\\\\,y&=0, \\\\end{align} restricting the direction of motion to the tangent of the circle. The next derivative of this equation implies ::\\\\begin{align} &&\\\\dot u\\\\,x+\\\\dot v\\\\,y+u\\\\,\\\\dot x+v\\\\,\\\\dot y&=0,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow&& \\\\lambda(x^2+y^2)-gy+u^2+v^2&=0,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow&& L^2\\\\,\\\\lambda-gy+u^2+v^2&=0, \\\\end{align} and the derivative of that last identity simplifies to L^2\\\\dot\\\\lambda-3gv=0 which implicitly implies the conservation of energy since after integration the constant E=\\\\tfrac32gy-\\\\tfrac12L^2\\\\lambda=\\\\frac12(u^2+v^2)+gy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. To obtain unique derivative values for all dependent variables the last equation was three times differentiated. This gives a differentiation index of 3, which is typical for constrained mechanical systems. If initial values (x_0,u_0) and a sign for y are given, the other variables are determined via y=\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{L^2-x^2}, and if y e0 then v=-ux/y and \\\\lambda=(gy-u^2-v^2)/L^2. To proceed to the next point it is sufficient to get the derivatives of x and u, that is, the system to solve is now :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot x&=u,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot u&=\\\\lambda x,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[0.3em] 0&=x^2+y^2-L^2,\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&=ux+vy,\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&=u^2-gy+v^2+L^2\\\\,\\\\lambda. \\\\end{align} This is a semi-explicit DAE of index 1. Another set of similar equations may be obtained starting from (y_0,v_0) and a sign for x. DAEs also naturally occur in the modelling of circuits with non-linear devices. Modified nodal analysis employing DAEs is used for example in the ubiquitous SPICE family of numeric circuit simulators. Similarly, Fraunhofer's Analog Insydes Mathematica package can be used to derive DAEs from a netlist and then simplify or even solve the equations symbolically in some cases. It is worth noting that the index of a DAE (of a circuit) can be made arbitrarily high by cascading/coupling via capacitors operational amplifiers with positive feedback.  Semi-explicit DAE of index 1  DAE of the form ::\\\\begin{align}\\\\dot x&=f(x,y,t),\\\\\\\\\\\\0&=g(x,y,t).\\\\end{align} are called semi-explicit. The index-1 property requires that g is solvable for y. In other words, the differentiation index is 1 if by differentiation of the algebraic equations for t an implicit ODE system results, ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\dot x&=f(x,y,t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&=\\\\partial_x g(x,y,t)\\\\dot x+\\\\partial_y g(x,y,t)\\\\dot y+\\\\partial_t g(x,y,t), \\\\end{align} which is solvable for (\\\\dot x,\\\\,\\\\dot y) if \\\\det\\\\left(\\\\partial_y g(x,y,t)\\\\right) e 0. Every sufficiently smooth DAE is almost everywhere reducible to this semi-explicit index-1 form.  Numerical treatment of DAE and applications  Two major problems in solving DAEs are index reduction and consistent initial conditions. Most numerical solvers require ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations of the form ::\\\\begin{align}\\\\frac{dx}{dt}&=f\\\\left(x,y,t\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\0&=g\\\\left(x,y,t\\\\right).\\\\end{align} It is a non-trivial task to convert arbitrary DAE systems into ODEs for solution by pure ODE solvers. Techniques which can be employed include Pantelides algorithm and dummy derivative index reduction method. Alternatively, a direct solution of high-index DAEs with inconsistent initial conditions is also possible. This solution approach involves a transformation of the derivative elements through orthogonal collocation on finite elements or direct transcription into algebraic expressions. This allows DAEs of any index to be solved without rearrangement in the open equation form ::\\\\begin{align}0&=f\\\\left(\\\\frac{dx}{dt},x,y,t\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\0&=g\\\\left(x,y,t\\\\right).\\\\end{align} Once the model has been converted to algebraic equation form, it is solvable by large-scale nonlinear programming solvers (see APMonitor). = Tractability = Several measures of DAEs tractability in terms of numerical methods have developed, such as differentiation index, perturbation index, tractability index, geometric index, and the Kronecker index.http://www.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/ise-labs/takamatsu- lab/takamatsu/metr/METR08-10.pdf  Structural analysis for DAEs  We use the \\\\Sigma-method to analyze a DAE. We construct for the DAE a signature matrix \\\\Sigma=(\\\\sigma_{i,j}), where each row corresponds to each equation f_i and each column corresponds to each variable x_j. The entry in position (i,j) is \\\\sigma_{i,j}, which denotes the highest order of derivative to which x_j occurs in f_i, or -\\\\infty if x_j does not occur in f_i. For the pendulum DAE above, the variables are (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)=(x,y,u,v,\\\\lambda).

Born in Sydney, Australia, McCulloch began his scientific career at the age of 13 as an unpaid assistant to Edgar Ravenswood Waite in the Australian Museum there; Waite encouraged McCulloch to study zoology. Three years later, he was employed as a \\"mechanical assistant\\", and five years after that, as curator of fishes, a post he held until his death. Memorial for Allan Riverstone McCulloch on Lord Howe Island McCulloch collected and published prolifically; from his first paper in 1906 (published in Records of the Australian Museum), no year passed without his making a contribution to science, and he wrote over 100 original papers in all, many including his own illustrations. McCulloch travelled widely for his collections, including trips to Queensland, Lord Howe Island, New Guinea, the Great Barrier Reef and various Pacific islands. His major research interest was in fish, but he was also given the responsibility of the crustacean collection from 1905 to 1921, and he wrote several significant papers on decapods. In 1922 McCulloch journeyed through Papua with Captain Frank Hurley. In 1922 his Check List of Fishes and Fish-like Animals of New South Wales was published by the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales. McCulloch's hectic schedule seems to have damaged his health, and he was forced to spend a year off work for his health's sake. He died, however, on Honolulu in 1925. His collection ultimately included over 40,000 specimens, and he was considered \\"the greatest authority on fish in the southern hemisphere\\" (David Starr Jordan). A monument to his memory stands on Lord Howe Island. In 1930, A Check List of the Fishes Recorded from Australia, edited by Gilbert P. Whitley from McCulloch's materials was published as Memoir V of the Australian museum of Sydney.

The track was extended northwards from Ongagawa to by 28 February 1891, with Orio being opened on the same day as one of the intermediate stations. On 30 August 1891, Orio also became an intermediate station for the Chikuho Kogyo Railway (later renamed the Chikuho Railway) when it laid a track from to . The Chikuho Railway merged with the Kyushu Railway on 1 October 1897. When the Kyushu Railway was nationalized on 1 July 1907, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) took over control of the station. On 12 October 1909, the station became part of the Hitoyoshi Main Line and then on 21 November 1909, part of the Kagoshima Main Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, JR Kyushu took over control of the station. The station building was rebuilt in 1916, but use of this building was discontinued from 6 October 2012 in preparation for rebuilding work, with operations shifted to a temporary structure. The station building was scheduled to be demolished during 2012, with the new structure completed in fiscal 2016.

It is part of the Dizzy series. It was published on several platforms, including Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear, Nintendo Entertainment System,NES instruction booklet, p. 1 Amiga and MS-DOS. The game was originally intended to be released in time for Christmas in 1990, but because of a legal action between Codemasters and Nintendo over the Game Genie the title was released in April 1991, making it miss the Christmas rush it was originally slated for. Furthermore, only sold 125,000 units instead of the expected 500,000. Despite this, the game was awarded the 'NES Adventure Game of the Year 1991' by Game Players Magazine and given the coveted 'Parents Choice Award'. Story The evil wizard Zaks casts a spell on the Yolkfolk and kidnaps Dizzy's girlfriend Daisy.NES instruction booklet, p. 3 It is up to Dizzy to undo Zaks' doings and rescue Daisy from the castle in the clouds. =Characters= Fantastic Dizzy contains all 16 characters in the series. While most of the Yolkfolk were harmed by Zaks, others have different problems. Other characters include Good Wizard Theodore, Blackheart the Pirate, the Palace Guard, Prince Clumsy, Rockwart the Troll, Shamus the Leprechaun and the Shop Owner.Nes instruction booklet, pp. 9-21 =Locations= There are several places for Dizzy to visit, including the whole complex of the Yolkfolk secret treehouse, the mine, the neighbouring city of Keldor, a pirate ship, a castle, the grasslands, Carber Bay, the cemetery and finally Zaks' Cloud Castle. The game generally scrolls horizontally, although some mini-games/sections scroll vertically. When Dizzy climbs a ladder or jumps to an off-screen platform, a new screen is loaded. As game play continues, the scenery cycles between night and day. Concept The game is hard to qualify in a genre: while it seems at first a platform game, Dizzy is vulnerable to all enemies while unable to eliminate them, and puzzles are completed by bringing an object to a location (in the same fashion as Gods and adventure games), and also has to capture all 250 stars scattered in the game. The game can also be seen as a union of all the previous games where the player can find a lot of familiar puzzles (e.g. Elevators, magic beans) and places (e.g. mines, deep sea) as well as several arcade minigames based on older games in the series (like Bubble Dizzy). =Stars= Depending on the version of the game, 100 or 250NES instruction booklet, p. 4 stars are scattered around the game which must be collected to grant access to the final confrontation with Zaks. While most stars are accessible in the regular parts of the game, some are placed inside the minigames, which forces the player to run through them as many times needed to get all stars. If the player tries to reach the tower without the stars, Dizzy is stunned by the electric door. =Objects= Dizzy can carry up to three items like keys and objects to be used to solve puzzles.NES instruction booklet, pp. 7-8 Some objects are meant to be traded to characters, given to characters, or placed in certain locations. Some are used to reach places or things otherwise inaccessibleNES instruction booklet, p. 6 or to protect from danger. This element is similar to the game Puggsy, released for Sega systems. =Minigames= While most of the game is passed in the slower platform sections, there are three minigames required to complete it, plus one to get all the stars. * Mine carts: Dizzy can travel in the carts found in the mine into other places in the game, collecting stars along the way. There are a number of dangers in the rails, from falling rocks, dead ends and carts in the opposite direction. Nearing the end, both cart speed and number of dead ends increase. * Dizzy Down the Rapids: Some versions of Fantastic Dizzy feature a section where Dizzy must ride a barrel down a river avoiding a pursuing troll and several natural hazards while riding surface currents and attempting to collect stars. This minigame is omitted from several versions, including the Mega Drive/Genesis and PC releases. * Castle Capers: A minigame based on the Operation Wolf concept, Dizzy, armed with a crossbow, has to get a 5 hit advantage over the trolls, who are occupying the castle. However, if the trolls get the same advantage, Dizzy loses a life. * Bubble Trouble: Dizzy has to reach a small island before his oxygen wears out. To do so, he has to ride air bubbles formed in the sea bed, and jumping into the platforms in the sides or other bubbles before they burst. Larger bubbles endure more, but are slower, while smaller ones are fast but burst shortly after Dizzy rides them. This minigame was adapted into a standalone title, called Bubble Dizzy however due to further development required on Fantastic Dizzy and Dizzy Down the Rapids, Bubble Dizzy was released November 1990. * Theodore's magic puzzle: The extra life minigame is a regular 4x4 shuffling puzzle, which has to be completed in inside a time limit. As the number of lives increase, so does the complexity of the puzzles.NES instruction booklet, p. 5 =Damage indicator=The game features a damage indicator, as a reverse version of health. When the meter fills up, Dizzy loses a life.

Fitzgerald Expressway) is a section of freeway in downtown Boston, Massachusetts; it is designated as Interstate 93, US 1 and Route 3. The original Artery, constructed in the 1950s, was named after John F. Fitzgerald; it was partly elevated and partly tunneled. Its reputation for congestion inspired the local nicknames \\"The Distressway,\\" \\"the largest parking lot in the world\\", and \\"the other Green Monster\\" (the paint of the highway girders shared the same color as the left field wall at Fenway Park). The Artery was significantly rerouted during a 10-year period from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s as part of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (the \\"Big Dig\\"). The present-day Artery is almost entirely directed through the newly constructed O'Neill Tunnel, while the original Artery was demolished and replaced with the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, named after the daughter of John F. Fitzgerald and the mother of John F. Kennedy. According to Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation data, the Central Artery runs from the Massachusetts Avenue Connector just beyond Andrew Square in South Boston north to the split with U.S. Route 1 in Charlestown. Along with the harbor tunnels and the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) from Route 128 to East Boston, it is part of the Metropolitan Highway System. History A 1920 plan for Boston's Central Artery, based on the West Side Elevated Highway Traffic on the former Central Artery at mid-day (Demolished in 2003) A 1926 state report on rapid transit expansion recommended the conversion of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated to an elevated highway; however, it closed in 1938 and was demolished in 1942. The above-ground Artery was built in two sections in the 1950s. First was the part north of High Street and Broad Street to the Tobin Bridge, built between 1951 and 1954. Immediately, residents began to hate the new highway and the way it towered over and separated neighborhoods. Due to this opposition, the southern end of the Central Artery through the South Station area was built underground, through what became known as the Dewey Square Tunnel. Eventually, the entire highway was moved underground as part of the Big Dig Project. The Dewey Square Tunnel was the one part of the original Artery not torn down; it now serves southbound traffic. The idea of building the entire Artery underground was first floated in the 1970s emanating from the central artery depression concept developed by the Boston Transportation Planning Review. The final section through the Dewey Square Tunnel and on to the Southeast Expressway at Massachusetts Avenue opened in 1959. The highway gradually became more and more congested as other highway projects meant to complement the Artery were canceled. These included the Inner Belt project, which would have taken through traffic off the Artery and the Massachusetts Turnpike Extension coming in from the west. The Southwest Expressway would have been the route of Interstate 95 from Canton into Boston, and would have tied into the Inner Belt of I-695. Modifications of the above-ground Artery, which was in service until its demolition in 2003 included an additional interchange for the Massachusetts Turnpike (Mass Pike) extension that was completed in 1965, the removal of several on and off-ramps and the reworking in the late 1980s of the Tobin Bridge interchange. The Central Artery North Area (CANA) project placed the above ground ramps from the Artery underground into the City Square Tunnel in Charlestown and resulted in a reworking of the interchange at the north end, placing the northbound offramp from the east side to the west side, and eliminating dangerous weaving across the lanes of the Charlestown High Bridge, which required traffic coming from Storrow Drive and wanting to go to Charlestown to cross three lanes of traffic in only a tenth of a mile. In September 2017, a new park was opened beneath the Central Artery adjacent to the Ink Block section of Boston's South End. The $8.5 million park has a dog park, new lighting, boardwalks, murals, and 175 parking spaces. The artwork in the public space was created by street artists from around the United States. Exit lists Southbound Interstate 93 beneath the streets of Boston The original Central Artery did not have any exit numbers. These were added after the roadway was designated as I-93 in 1974. Many of these exits either do not exist or no longer resemble their original forms. Exits 19, 21, and 25 were completely eliminated. 20 and 26 were separated northbound and southbound; 20 northbound uses the old exit 19 location in South Bay, while southbound begins at the portal to the renovated Dewey Square Tunnel (now completely enclosed by Big Dig construction; 26 northbound begins just shy of the tunnel exit onto the Zakim Bridge, while 26 southbound is located in Charlestown's Sullivan Square near northbound exit 28 at the portal to the double decked section of I-93 and feeds onto the Leverett Circle Connector bridge. 22 continued to exist as an offramp to Chinatown from the southbound (former northbound) Dewey Square tunnel until the ramp was closed off in 2004. 23 exists both northbound and southbound and leads to the Scollay Square area. 24 now exits to Haymarket Square and MA-1A (the Callahan Tunnel). Much of the reconfiguration of on and offramps (particularly the wide separations of the ramps for exits 20 and 26) was done to move exiting traffic off the mainline of the road, reducing stress on the mainline. =Pre-Big Dig= Central Artery exit towards Oliver Street, near One International Place, overlooking Custom House Tower, 2002 The entire route was in Boston, Suffolk County. =Post-Big Dig= The entire route is in Boston, Suffolk County. Numbering The elevated Central Artery around 1999, on the right. Currently, the Artery is numbered I-93 and US 1 on the whole route, and Route 3 on all but the northernmost section‚Äìit leaves at Exit 26. The Artery has had many different route numbers through its history. When first built, the section between the Sumner Tunnel and Storrow Drive received the numbers C1 and C9 (city routes of US 1 and Route 9), which were rerouted off local streets. The rest of the highway was unnumbered, despite being closely paralleled by C37 south from the Sumner Tunnel. By 1969, I-95 was assigned to the whole Artery as part of its never-built route through Boston. The \\"C-prefixed\\" routes were removed in 1971, with Route C1 becoming part of a realigned US 1, using the Artery between Storrow Drive and the Sumner Tunnel. Additionally in 1971, Route 3 was moved from a bypass around downtown to use the Artery south of Storrow Drive and the Southeast Expressway. In 1974, I-95 was canceled through Boston (cancelling its approach from Providence, Rhode Island through the Southwest Corridor) and was instead rerouted around the city using part of Route 128. US 1 was realigned to use the Tobin Bridge and Northeast Expressway, which had been signed as part of I-95; thus US 1 used the Artery north of Storrow Drive. The former alignment of US 1 from Storrow Drive south along the Artery to the Sumner Tunnel became an extended 1A, and I-93 was extended south from Charlestown along the Artery, Southeast Expressway and Route 128 from Braintree to Canton. In 1989, US 1 was moved off the MDC Parkways onto its current alignment along the full Artery. Route 1A was then truncated to the Sumner Tunnel interchange. Signs put up for the new underground Artery only mention I-93, since it is the best-known designation. Older signs may mention only I-93 and US 1 or I-93 and Route 3. A 2008/2009 project to update this signage helped to clear up this potentially confusing situation.

The comic album is a very common printed medium. The typical album is printed in large format, generally with high quality paper and colouring, commonly 24x32 cm (9.4x12.6 in), has around 48‚Äì60 pages, but examples with more than 100 pages are common. While sometimes referred to as graphic novels, this term is rarely used in Europe, and is not always applicable as albums often consist of separate short stories, placing them somewhere halfway between a comic book and a graphic novel. The European comic genres vary from the humorous adventure vein, such as The Adventures of Tintin and Asterix, to more adult subjects like Tex Willer, Diabolik, and Thorgal. History The roots of European on-paper comics date back to 18th century caricatures (mocking others styles or behaviors) and illustrated picture books such as Wilhelm Busch's Max and Moritz. The early 19th century Swiss artist Rodolphe T√∂pffer is regarded by many as the \\"father of the modern comic\\" and his publication Histoire de M.

Cabot's original voyages After a voyage which had got no further than Iceland, Cabot left again with only one vessel, the Matthew, a small ship (50 tons), but fast and able. The crew consisted of only 18 men. The Matthew departed 2 May 1497. He sailed to Dursey Head (latitude 51¬∞36N), Ireland, from where he sailed due west, expecting to reach Asia. However, landfall was reached in North America on 24 June 1497. His precise landing place is a matter of much controversy, with Cape Bonavista or St. John's in Newfoundland the most likely sites. Cabot went ashore to take possession of the land, and explored the coast for some time, probably departing on 20 July. On the homeward voyage his sailors incorrectly thought they were going too far north, so Cabot sailed a more southerly course, reaching Brittany instead of England. On 6 August he arrived back in Bristol. Historic information Lack of clear documentation has been a problem in studying the history of Matthew. Even its name has been questioned, with some authors suggesting that it was actually named Mattea after Cabot's wife.Wilson, Ian John Cabot and the Matthew Breakwater Books 2001 p.22 Until the 1950s, all that was known about its size is that it was a small ship carrying about 18 men, but the discovery of a letter from a Bristol merchant named John Day written in 1497 saying that \\"in his voyage he had only one ship of fifty 'toneles' and twenty men and food for seven or eight months\\" provided more certainty about its size.'Jones, Evan \\"The Matthew of Bristol and the financiers of John Cabot‚Äôs 1497 Voyage to North America\\" English Historical Review Vol. CXXI No. 492 (2006)' The age of the ship is also uncertain. The name Matthew does not appear in the 1492/3 customs accounts, so it was either fairly new or an older ship renamed or a foreign ship. It has been suggested that it probably was an ordinary Bristol merchant ship hired for the occasion. The name Matthew appears in documents in 1503/04 and 1510/11 but in a 1513 survey there is reference to a 'new Matthew' and references to this ship afterward leave out the 'new' suggesting that Cabot's Matthew no longer existed.  Replica  Matthew replica moored in Bristol To celebrate the 500th anniversary of Cabot's voyage, a replica of Matthew was built in Bristol by Storms'l Services, a precursor of the Bristol Classic Boat Company. The design was by naval architect Colin Mudie. She was dedicated in a ceremony during the first International Festival of the Sea, held in Bristol's Floating Harbour in 1996. The next year, she reconstructed Cabot's original journey on the 500th anniversary of the landmark voyage.

She is a lady from the castle of Astolat who dies of her unrequited love for Sir Lancelot. Well-known versions of her story appear in Sir Thomas Malory's 1485 book Le Morte d'Arthur, Alfred, Lord Tennyson's mid-19th-century Idylls of the King, and Tennyson's poem \\"The Lady of Shalott\\". She should not be confused with Elaine of Corbenic, the mother of Galahad by Lancelot. Legend A version of the story appeared in the early 13th-century French Mort Artu, in which the Lady of Escalot (Demoiselle d'Escalot) dies of unrequited love for Lancelot and drifts down a river to Camelot in a boat.Lancelot-Grail: The Story And Its Branches Another version is told in the 13th-century Italian novellina La Damigella di Scalot (No. LXXXII in the collection Il Novellino: Le ciento novelle antike). Two of Tennyson's poems, both titled \\"The Lady of Shalott\\" (1832 and 1842), were inspired by the Italian version. In the 14th-century English Stanzaic Morte Darthur, she is known as the Maid of Ascolot. =Le Morte d'Arthur= left In Thomas Malory's 15th-century Le Morte d'Arthur, Elaine's story begins when her father Bernard, the lord of Astolat (William Caxton's misread of Malory's original Ascolathttps://www.jstor.org/stable/43343737), organises a jousting tournament, attended by King Arthur and his knights. While Sir Lancelot was not originally planning to attend, he is persuaded otherwise and visits Bernard and his two sons before the tournament. While Lancelot is in her family's household, Elaine becomes enamoured of him and begs him to wear her token at the coming tournament. Explaining that Queen Guinevere would be at the tournament, he consents to wear the token but says that he will have to fight in disguise so as not to be recognized. He asks Bernard if he can leave his recognizable shield with him and borrow another. Bernard agrees and lends him the plain-white shield of Sir Torre, Elaine's brother. Lancelot goes on to win the jousting tournament, still in disguise, fighting against King Arthur's party and beating forty of them in the tournament. He does, however, receive an injury to his side from Sir Bors' lance, and is carried off the field by Elaine's other brother, Sir Lavaine, to the hermit Sir Baudwin's cave (Baudwin being a former knight of the Round Table himself). Elaine then urges her father to let her bring the wounded Lancelot to her chambers, where she nurses him. When Lancelot is well, he makes ready to leave, and offers to pay Elaine for her services; insulted, Elaine brings him his shield, which she had been guarding, and a wary Lancelot leaves the castle, never to return but now aware of her feelings for him. Ten days later, Elaine dies of heartbreak. In accordance with her instructions, her body is placed in a small boat, clutching a lily in one hand, and her final letter in the other. She then floats down the river to Camelot (Winchester), where she is discovered by King Arthur's court, who call her 'a little lily maiden'. Lancelot is summoned and hears the contents of the letter, after which he explains what happened. Lancelot proceeds to pay for a rich funeral.

The square was a well-known feature of Boston from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, when the buildings around it were demolished to make way for the Central Artery and Government Center. The Haymarket produce market continues to operate at a location near the historic site of the square. History of the square During the early years of European settlement in Boston, the future site of Haymarket Square was in a part of Boston Harbor called Mill Cove. The mouth of the cove was dammed in the 1640s, turning it into Mill Pond. In 1807, the town of Boston gave the Boston Mill Corporation permission to begin filling in Mill Pond. A street plan for the filled land was proposed in 1808 by Charles Bulfinch. Filling of the pond to create the area known as the Bulfinch Triangle was completed in the early 1820s. The future location of Haymarket Square, where Merrimack, Canal, and Charleston Streets converged at the southern tip of the Bulfinch Triangle, appears on an 1826 map. 1895 drawing of filled land A drawing published in 1895 entitled \\"View of the New Land in 1828\\" shows Haymarket Square. Images from the early 1800s show hay being sold in the square. The name Haymarket Square appears on an 1844 map. From its opening in 1845 to its demolition in 1897, the most prominent building on the square was the Boston and Maine Railroad depot. In 1893, the depot was replaced by North Union Station, several blocks to the north on Causeway Street. The depot was demolished to make way for construction of the Canal Street incline, the northern end of the Tremont Street subway, the predecessor to the MBTA Green Line. The Haymarket station on the subway line opened in 1898, with an entrance kiosk in the center of Haymarket Square. In 1902, the Haymarket Relief Station, a branch of Boston City Hospital, opened in a new building on the former site of the depot on the north side of the square. Most of the buildings around the square were demolished in the 1950s for the construction of the elevated Central Artery, or in the 1960s for the construction of Government Center. Construction began in January 2017 on Bulfinch Crossing, a 2.9 million square foot redevelopment on the site of the Government Center Garage. The northeast corner of the garage is at the location of Haymarket Square. The name \\"Haymarket\\" in Boston The Haymarket Theatre operated in a building on the other side of Boston Common several decades before the creation of Haymarket Square. Haymarket Station on the MBTA Orange and Green lines is located adjacent to the historic site of the square. The Haymarket produce market is operated by the Haymarket Pushcart Association. \\"Haymarket Square\\" was the original name of a hotel and market building which began construction in 2018 on Blackstone Street between Hanover Street and North Street, a block south of the historic location of Haymarket Square.

It was written by Howard Franklin, produced by its star, Bill Murray, and co-directed by both. Geena Davis, Randy Quaid, Jason Robards, Tony Shalhoub, Stanley Tucci, Phil Hartman, Victor Argo, Kurtwood Smith, Bob Elliott and Philip Bosco all co-star. It is based on a book of the same name by Jay Cronley, which had previously been adapted into the 1985 Canadian film Hold-Up starring Jean-Paul Belmondo. The film is set in New York City, particularly in Manhattan and Queens, with scenes taking place on the New York City Subway and within John F. Kennedy International Airport. Times Square, the Empire State Building, and the Statue of Liberty are also briefly seen. Quick Change is the only directorial credit of Bill Murray's career. Plot Grimm, dressed as a clown, robs a bank in midtown Manhattan. He sets up an ingenious hostage situation and successfully gets away with $1 million and his accomplices: girlfriend Phyllis and best friend Loomis. The heist itself is comparatively straightforward and easy, but the getaway turns into a nightmare. The relatively simple act of getting to the airport to catch a flight out of the country is complicated by the fact that fate, luck and all of New York City appears to be conspiring against their escape. To begin with, the trio is seeking the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to get to the airport, but the signs were removed during construction work, resulting in the three robbers becoming lost in an unfamiliar neighborhood in Brooklyn. Then, a conman/thief robs the trio of everything they have (except the bank money, which they have taped under their clothes). After changing into new clothes at Phyllis' apartment, they are confronted and nearly gunned down by the paranoid and stressed-out incoming tenant. At the same time, a fire has broken out across the street and the fire department arrives and pushes their car away from a hydrant only to cause it to roll downhill and then down an embankment. When the three crooks eventually manage to flag down a cab, the foreign driver is hopelessly non-fluent in English. This causes a hysterical Loomis to jump out of the moving cab to grab another, but he runs into a newsstand, knocking himself unconscious. The driver leaves, thinking he's killed Loomis. An anal-retentive bus driver, a run-in with mobsters and Phyllis' increasing desperation to tell Grimm the news that she is pregnant with his child add further complications. All the while, Rotzinger, a world-weary but relentless chief of the New York City Police Department, is doggedly attempting to nab the fleeing trio. A meeting on board an airliner at the airport occurs between the robbers and the chief, who gets the added prize of having a major crime boss dropped in his lap with their assistance. Unfortunately the chief only realizes who they were after their plane has taken off. Cast Bill Murray as Grimm * Geena Davis as Phyllis Potter * Randy Quaid as Loomis * Jason Robards as Chief Walt Rotzinger * Tony Shalhoub as Cab Driver * Philip Bosco as Bus Driver * Phil Hartman as Edison * Bob Elliott as Bank Guard * Jamey Sheridan as Mugger * Stanley Tucci as Johnny * Kurtwood Smith as Vince Lombino/Russ Crane * Victor Argo as Skelton * Jack Gilpin as Yuppie Hostage Reception Despite being a box office bomb, the film was well received critically. In fact, several critics claim it is one of Murray's finest roles: a jaded man who has had too much of the Big Apple. Also praised were the strong performances by the supporting cast, particularly Robards as the police chief Rotzinger, who, while almost as burned out as Murray, is still determined to capture the robbers as a swan song to his long career. Roger Ebert, in his July 13, 1990 Chicago Sun-Times review, wrote: Quick Change' is a funny but not an inspired comedy. It has two directors...and I wonder if that has anything to do with its inability to be more than just efficiently entertaining.\\" The film currently holds an 82% \\"fresh\\" rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews.

Between March 31 and April 2, 1914, 132 sealers were stranded on the ice floes. During their two days and nights on the ice, 77 men died; another man later died from his injuries in a hospital in St. John's. 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster On March 30, 1914, Newfoundland was jammed in ice off the northern coast of Newfoundland. Her captain, Wes Kean, could see signals from the SS Stephano, commanded by his father Abram Kean, indicating that there were seals several miles away. The following morning, Wes Kean sent his crew in that direction across the ice to begin killing seals, under command of his first mate, expecting that if the weather worsened they would stay overnight aboard Stephano. When the men reached Stephano, Abram Kean gave the men lunch and then ordered them back onto the ice to kill seals and find the Newfoundland, despite signs of worsening weather. SS Stephano As a storm began that afternoon, both the captain of Newfoundland and the captain of the nearby Stephano thought the men were safely aboard the other man's vessel. The company which owned Newfoundland had removed the ship's radio transceiver because it was an added expense which did not contribute to profits. Newfoundlands captain, believing that the men were aboard Stephano, did not blow the ship's whistle to signal his location, which would have allowed his men to find the ship in the darkness and rain. The sealers endured two nights without shelter, first in a freezing rain storm and then in a snow storm. The dead and survivors alike were picked up around 54 hours later by another ship in the fleet, SS Bellaventure, under Captain Isaac Randell. Of the 132 men aboard Newfoundland, 78 died, and many more were seriously injured. This disaster occurred during the same storm in which sank with all hands. The total loss from all three sealing ships totaled over 250 lives and the collective tragedy became known as the 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster. Carrying survivors and bodies to SS Bellaventure after the SS Newfoundland sealing disaster This event was the subject of the book Death on the Ice by Cassie Brown, and two National Film Board of Canada documentaries: \\"I Just Didn't Want to Die\\": The 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster (1991) and the multimedia short 54 Hours (2014). After the 1914 sealing disaster The Newfoundland was sold to Job Brothers & Co. in 1915 and her name was changed to Samuel Blandford in 1916. A poem about this was written by James Murphy on January 27, 1916. The vessel was wrecked when she struck the Keys, near St. Mary's Bay on August 3, 1916. Heritage Another Newfoundland vessel carried the name Newfoundland for many years afterwards. This steel steam-liner was mobilized as part of the merchant navy and during peacetime acted as a passenger liner, usually pointing her bow towards Boston or Liverpool.

She was referred to as \\"God's image carved in ebony\\". Early life Smith was born to slaves in Long Green, Maryland, a small town in Baltimore County. Her father's was Samuel Berry and her mother's was Mariam Matthews. She was the oldest of thirteen siblings. Her father was a well-trusted man, and his master‚Äôs widow trusted him enough to place him in charge of her farm. After his duties for the day were done, Mr. Berry was allowed to go out and earn extra money for himself and his family. Many nights he would go without sleeping because he was busy making brooms and husk mats for the Baltimore market to make extra cash. He was devoted to the goal of freedom. After first purchasing his freedom, he made it his mission to buy his family's. Ruth Bogin, and Bert James Loewenberg, \\"Amanda Berry Smith.\\" Black Women in Nineteenth-Century American Life: Their Words, Their Thoughts, Their Feelings, (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1976.), 143 After his family's freedom was secured, the Smiths settled in Pennsylvania. = Childhood = Growing up, Smith had the advantage of learning to read and write. ‚ÄúHer father made it a regular practice on Sunday mornings to read to his family from the Bible. Her mother helped her to learn reading before she was eight and was sent to school.‚Äù Unlike many other enslaved children and adults, Smith had the privilege of learning at an early age. She and her younger brother attended school at the age of eight. The school only held summer sessions and after six weeks of attending, the school was forced to close. Five years later, at the age of 13, they had been given another option of attending school. However, the school was five miles from their home and they would only be taught if there was time after the teachers gave the white kids their lesson. The Smith siblings felt that it was not worth traveling in the cold to receive lessons only if time was permitted. After two weeks of attending school, they dropped out and were taught at home by their parents and sometimes taught themselves. Ruth Bogin, and Bert James Loewenberg, \\"Amanda Berry Smith.\\" Black Women in Nineteenth-Century American Life: Their Words, Their Thoughts, Their Feelings, (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1976.), 142 With only having three and a half months of formal schooling, Amanda went to work near York, Pennsylvania, as the servant of a widow with five children. While there, she attended a revival service at the Methodist Episcopal Church. Adult life Smith worked as a cook and a washerwoman to provide for herself and her daughter after her husband was killed in the American Civil War. By the time Smith was thirty-two, she had lost two husbands and four of her five children. Attending religious camp meetings and revivals helped Smith work through her grief and avoid depression. She immersed herself in the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. Prayer became a way of life for her as she trusted God for shoes, the money to buy her sister's freedom, and food for her family. She became well known for her beautiful voice and inspired teaching and hence, opportunities to evangelize in the South and West opened up for her. African-American women in the nineteenth century took the way they dressed very seriously and so did others. Being a preacher and traveling as much as Amanda did, she thought out her dress carefully. Wherever she went, she wore a plain poke bonnet and a brown or black Quaker wrapper, and she carried her own carpetbag suitcase. The appearances of women in the nineteenth century have been described as ‚Äú[Especially] fraught with volatile meanings, as the line between seemingly overly sexual or appearing presumptuously dressed above one‚Äôs station was a fine one.‚Äù African-American women struggled with receiving the respect they deserved even if they dressed the part of a lady. This was due to ‚ÄúShadowed stereotypes bred in slavery of wanton Jezebels and pious Mammies‚Ä¶‚Äù If free African-American women dressed out of their respective class, judgments would be made against them.Klassen, Pamela E. \\"The Robes of Womanhood: Dress and Authenticity among African American Methodist Women in the Nineteenth Century.\\" Religion & American Culture 14, no. 1 (Winter 2004) America: History & Life, EBSCOhost (Dec 20, 2013), 43 In 1878, Smith arranged for her daughter, Mazie, to study in England. The two traveled overseas and stayed in England for two years. On the journey over, the captain invited her to conduct a religious service on board and she was so modest that the other passengers spread word of her. She next traveled to and ministered in India, where she stayed for eighteen months. Smith then spent eight years in Africa, working with churches and evangelizing. She traveled to Liberia and West Africa. Smith also expanded her family by adopting two African boys. While in Africa she suffered from repeated attacks of \\"African Fever\\" but persisted in her work. As a strong proponent of the Temperance Movement both in Africa and in the United States, she was invited by noted temperance advocate Rev. Dr. Theodore Ledyard Cuyler to preach at his Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York, then the largest church in its denomination, on her return to America. Smith fund raised for the Amanda Smith Orphanage and Industrial Home for Abandoned and Destitute Colored Children. It was an institution for the poor and friendless colored children. Located in North Harvey, in a suburban neighborhood in Chicago, the orphanage opened on June 28, 1899. The institution provided a home for children to become self-reliant. Funds were sent by the Ladies Negro's Friend Society in Birmingham, UK. Smith traveled many states to help gather money to support her work. ‚ÄúSupport for this institution depended on interracial cooperation for fund-raising and an advisory board. To raise funds for the initial costs, Smith enlisted Methodist interracial cooperation across the country.‚Äù She was dedicated and put forth a lot of energy for the home. However, she soon met conflict with the orphanage due to many problems such as financial, a fire that destroyed the building, conflict between Smith and the staff, complaints from neighbors, and failed inspections by the orphan home investigators. Two years following Smith‚Äôs death, another fire broke out in the home killing two girls. The building was closed for good.Pope-Levison, Priscilla. \\"Methodist Interracial Cooperation In The Progressive Era: Amanda Berry Smith And Emma Ray.\\" Methodist History 49, no. 2 (January 2011) America: History & Life, EBSCOhost (Dec 20, 2013).

The word basse describes the nature of the dance, in which partners move quietly and gracefully in a slow gliding or walking motion without leaving the floor, while in livelier dances both feet left the floor in jumps or leaps. The basse danse was a precursor of the pavane as a dignified processional dance . The term may apply to the dance or the music alone. History Dance at Herod's Court, an engraving by Israhel van Meckenem, ca. 1490. The Grand Ball, engraving by Master MZ dated 1500; it shows the court in Munich The earliest record of a basse danse is found in an Occitan poem of the 1320s by Raimon de Cornet, who notes that the joglars performed them. The bassa danza is described in the dance treatise of Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro, in northern Italy towards the end of the 15th century, and by his friend Antonio Cornazzano, for whom it was the queen of all dance measures, low dance to be contrasted with the alta danza, the \\"high\\" or leaping dance called the saltarello. In Germany it became the Hofdantz . Thoinot Arbeau used the basse danse to explain his method of dance notation in his Orch√©sographie (1589). The dance was danced until 1725 but was extinguished soon after by the \\"high\\" dance technique of ballet The general measure of the basse danse was elaborated into different named sequences of steps and movements . The basic measure is counted in sixes but, like the later courante, often combines and time, using hemiola to divide the six as 3‚Äì3 or as 2‚Äì2‚Äì2. This rhythm matches the basic steps of the dance. Most basse danse music is in binary form with each section repeated . The basse danse was often followed by a tourdion, due to their contrasting tempi, and these were danced and composed in pairs en suite like the \\"pavane and galliard\\" and the \\"allemande and courante\\" (; ). Early music consisted of songs based on a tenor cantus firmus and the length of the choreography was often derived from the verse of the chanson. In performance three or four instrumentalists would improvise the polyphony based on this tenor. In others multiple parts were written, though choice of instrumentation was left to the performers. Most famous, perhaps, are the basses danses assembled in 1530 by Pierre Attaingnant in the \\"Attaingnant Dance Prints\\", which were for four voices, typically improvised upon by adding melodic embellishment (Attaingnant rarely wrote ornamentation, though he did in \\"Pavin of Albart\\", an embellishment on \\"Pavane 'Si je m'en vois'\\") .  Dance steps  A 16th-century basse danse A treatise in the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels gives us information about the elements of basse danse and the choreography of specific examples. The basse danse is based upon four steps: pas simple, pas double, d√©marche (also known as the reprise) and branle. * Pas simples are done in pairs, dancers take two steps (typically first left and then right) in one measure counting 2‚Äì2‚Äì2. * In pas double, dancers take instead three steps, counting 3‚Äì3. These steps take advantage of the hemiola feel of the basse danse. * In the d√©marche, dancers take a step backwards and shift their weight forward and then back in three motions in the feel of . * In the branle, dancers step to the left, shifting their weight left, and then close again, in two motions in the feel of . The r√©v√©rence, occurring typically before or after the choreography, is a bow or curtsy that takes place over the course of one measure.

Busui (ÁÑ°Á≤ã), literally \\"non-iki\\", is synonymous with yabo. A non-iki thing is not necessarily yabo but probably is. Something that is yabo is usually unrefined, gigantic, coarse, childish, colorful, self- conscious, permanent, loud, superficial, vulgar, snobbish, boorish, etc. The word yabo was often used by city dwellers, or Ch≈çnin (especially those of Edo). It often refers to samurai and farmers (nomin) from outside Edo, but could also be applied to another chonin. The city dwellers of Edo sometimes called themselves Edokko (similar to New Yorker or Parisian). Proud of having been born and raised in Edo, they had a tendency to despise outsiders. However, the origins of many chonin could be traced back to other areas and backgrounds. The meaning of the term has expanded and generalized through the modernization of Japan. Today, the word yabo is used more frequently than iki. References Further readingCecilia Segawa Seigle. Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan.

It is one of the four national radio channels produced by Deutschlandradio. History Deutschlandfunk Satellite truck in front of Glocke in Bremen Broadcasting in the Federal Republic of Germany is reserved under the Basic Law (constitution) to the states. This means that all public broadcasting is regionalised. National broadcasts must be aired through the national consortium of regional public broadcasters (ARD) or authorized by a treaty negotiated between the states. In the 1950s, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) began broadcasting its Deutschlandsender station on longwave. In response to this, the then- Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk applied for a licence to operate a similar longwave service on behalf of the ARD. This was granted in 1956 and operated as Deutscher Langwellensender (\\"German Longwave Station\\"). On 29 November 1960, the federal government under Konrad Adenauer created Deutschlandfunk as a national broadcasting corporation based in Cologne. At the same time, the government's attempted creation of a national television channel under its direct control (later to become ZDF) prompted a complaint from several states to the Federal Constitutional Court regarding broadcasting powers. In the \\"First Broadcasting Judgement\\", handed down on 28 February 1961, the court held while that broadcasting to Germany was not a power granted to the federal government and therefore delegated to the states, broadcasting from Germany to other countries fell under the federal government's responsibility to conduct foreign affairs. When Norddeutscher Rundfunk's licence to broadcast on longwave expired, the federal government acquired the frequencies for Deutschlandfunk and began transmissions on 1 January 1962, joining the ARD on 7 June. Deutschlandfunk broadcast primarily in German, targeting the GDR and German-speaking minorities in Eastern Europe. However, its European Department was responsible for foreign-language transmissions to neighbouring countries in Europe, primarily from the Ehndorf transmitter. From 7 June 1963 it began foreign language transmissions in Czech, Croatian, Polish and Serbian. Later it focused on the Federal Republic's free neighbours in northern Europe, including English programming for Ireland and the UK. Inter-continental broadcasts were the responsibility of Deutsche Welle. Back in 1989, also news on the half-hour were placed next to the hourly news. =Post-reunification= Deutschlandfunk headquarters in Cologne, Germany After reunification, negotiations between the states and the Federal Government led to a reorganization of Germany's national and international public broadcasters in which DLF lost its independence and ARD membership. On 1 July 1993, DLF's European Department was transferred to Deutsche Welle. DLF English programmes were phased out over several years and replaced by DW's intercontinental programmes. The rest of DLF was merged into Deutschlandradio (\\"Germany Radio\\"), a public broadcasting institution created to oversee national services, from 1 January 1994. DLF was given a new remit as a news and current affairs service, while retaining its staff and studio facilities in Cologne. The service remains free of advertising. In the years immediately after the merger it was sometimes referred to as DeutschlandRadio K√∂ln (\\"Germany Radio Cologne\\"). Deutschlandradio developed its service and beside of Deutschlandfunk( mainly news and information) and Deutschlandfunk Kultur (culture in a broader sense) they started Deutschlandfunk Nova, which is based on production also from Deutschlandfunk and targets young adults, mainly with spoken-word. The Dokumente und Debatten is an opt-out channel, often for special events and significant parliament debats. Programming Deutschlandfunk's schedules are largely made up of news and documentaries, covering politics, economics and science. Music is also aired, especially during nighttime and weekend hours, it can account for half of the airtime. =News= Deutschlandfunk broadcasts a news bulletin every half hour weekdays between 04:00 and 18:00, and every hour at all other times (except Saturday at 21:00). In even-numbered hours between 06:00 and 20:00; everyday at 13:00 and weekdays at 23:00, the bulletins can last up to 10 minutes; and 5 minutes at all other times. The traffic bulletins cover the information of the whole Germany. On weekdays, the morning news magazine Informationen am Morgen is broadcast between 05:00 and 09:00, with frequent news bulletins. News magazines are also broadcast between 12:00 and 13:30 (Informationen am Mittag), and between 18:00 and 18:40 (Informationen am Abend). The main evening bulletin (Das war der Tag (\\"That was the Day\\")) is from 23:10 to 23:57. Selections from German and international newspaper commentaries are interspersed in the morning, noon, and midnight news magazines. =Culture= On Sundays, a discussion programme called Essay und Diskurs is broadcast between 09:30 and 10:00, covering subjects as varied as Islam in Germany, neurophysiology and the history of art. These discussions are archived on the internet . =International cooperation= Deutschlandfunk provides programming for the German-language Belgian radio station BRF-DLF in Brussels. It also cooperates with the main Belgischer Rundfunk (BRF) domestic radio service for the East Cantons of Walonia, BRF1. Technologies Ravensburg- Horgenzell transmitter Deutschlandfunk broadcasts in FM, DAB, and broadcast digitally via the Astra satellite system and used in the German and some European cable networks. Until the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 came into effect on 23 November 1978, Deutschlandfunk was transmitted on longwave from Sender Donebach and on mediumwave from Bad D√ºrrheim, Cremlingen, Ravensburg, Ehndorf, and Mainflingen. With implementation of the plan Bad D√ºrrheim was shut down. In 1979 new transmitters came into service: in Erching for daytime longwave transmission and in 1980/81 in Nordkirchen and Thurnau for mediumwave transmission. On 1 January 1989 the Aholming transmitter replaced Erching and allowed 24-hour service on the second longwave frequency. On 1 October 1994 Heusweiler transmitter, which had previously transmitted \\"Europawelle Saar\\", began transmitting Deutschlandfunk. On 31 December 1994 Mainflingen transmitter was shut down. On 31 December 2014 longwave transmissions from Donebach on 153 kHz and Aholming on 207 kHz ceased, although Donebach 153 kHz continued into the early hours of 1 January 2015 before being shut down. On 31 December 2015 all remaining medium wave transmissions ceased at 2350 CET. =FM= FM transmitters carry the Deutschlandfunk signal throughout Germany but there are gaps in the coverage pattern, especially ‚Äî but not only ‚Äî in the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemberg. As the state authorities have the power to allocate frequencies to broadcasters, they give preference to the regional public and commercial broadcasters under their jurisdiction. =Streaming= Several streams of Deutschlandfunk are available in MP3, AAC and Opus formats.

The Romo movement was essentially a derivation of late-1970s disco and early-1980s club music, with an emphasis on the extroverted sartorial style and decadent air of New Romantic-era bands such as Japan and Soft Cell. Nonetheless, contemporary features in Melody Maker (where the genre was championed mainly by Simon Price and Taylor Parkes ‚Äì it was dismissed by the rival NME) tended to downplay the nostalgic connection with New Romantic, emphasising Romo's newness and contemporary relevance. Much championed by the aforesaid writers at the Melody Maker as a stylish and poppy backlash against the dressed-down style of the Britpop movement, while variously feted and lambasted by others in the media as a New Romantic revival (a tag rejected by those on the scene), Romo's prime legacy has been chiefly in club culture as it heralded a new generation of glam/style orientated club nights which would continue through the 2000s.  History  = Birth of Romo = Club Skinny was created in spring 1995 by promoters Kevin Wilde and Paul \\"HiFi\\" Nugent as a club playing stylish 1980s pop as an antidote to the fashion for indie-derived Britpop. The club was originally located at Camden's Laurel Tree venue, then the home of top Britpop clubnight Blow Up. Wilde and Nugent regarded it as a subversive and \\"punk\\" act to host their glamorous pop night at a major epicentre of the indie/Britpop movement they were opposing. Although initially forced to make the compromise of including concerts by upcoming Britpop bands in order to attract punters, the club gained momentum after members of Persecution Complex, a female David Bowie-influenced band noted for their flamboyant dress sense, became regulars at the club, attracting a flow of further flamboyant club-goers in their wake. A further development was the recruitment of two glamorous 1980s-styled bands Plastic Fantastic and DexDexTer, the former a Brighton-based Roxy Music/Japan- influenced outfit fronted by former Scorpio Rising/Supercharger frontman Stuart Miller, the latter formerly known as MkII and led by Xavior (born Paul Wilkinson, also formerly known as Paul Roide). a future Placebo keyboardist. The two bands were duly scheduled to double-headline the 17 August edition of Club Skinny. In addition, one of the aspiring Britpop bands who had been playing at the club, Viva, led by Derek 'Del' Gray, were inspired by the club to reinvent themselves as a pure pop/disco outfit in the same vein as ABC circa The Lexicon of Love. Wilde would subsequently become the manager of both Viva and DexDexTer. = Discovery by Simon Price of Melody Maker = Melody Maker writer Simon Price was already alert to the existence of Plastic Fantastic and had previously linked them, together with Sexus, a Manchester- based \\"intelligent handbag\\" duo consisting of singer David Savage and keyboard player Paul Southern (together formerly indie guitar duo Sanity Plexus) and a non-glamorous electronic act called Boutique, as \\"New Romo\\" [sic] in a June 1995 review for Sexus's debut single \\"Edenites\\".Singles review: Sexus ‚Äì Edenites, Single of the Week No. 1, Simon Price, Melody Maker 24 June 1995 p32 (His colleague Everett True also heavily used the term Romo for a Plastic Fantastic review that summer.)Romo Copped ‚Äì Plastic Fantastic Live Review at the Richmond, Brighton, Melody Maker 5 August 1995 p17 Price was invited to the aforementioned double bill edition of Club Skinny and, with the event judged a success by all concerned, not only began to cover the scene enthusiastically in his writing, converting his colleague Taylor Parkes along the way, but also opened up a second clubnight for the scene in Soho, named Arcadia. This was based at L'Equippe Anglais in Duke Street but later moved to legendary Soho drag bar Madame Jojo's. Club Skinny meanwhile also relocated to HQ's, a venue in Camden Lock Market close to Dingwalls starting with the club's 31 August 1995 edition. A Plastic Fantastic/Viva/DexDexTer triple bill at the venue on 28 September 1995 was reviewed by Parkes in memorable fashion: By this time, more acts were emerging from the scene. Orlando who had played live as an indie band in 1993-1994 before withdrawing to reinvent themselves as an \\"alienated\\" white soul duo consisting of singer Tim Chipping, guitarist/lyricist Dickon Edwards and some sidemen, approached Club Skinny to relaunch themselves as a live act. Punk trio Xerox Girls likewise reinvented themselves as a glacial synth/electro duo Hollywood consisting of singer Hannah Edgren and keyboardist Stacey Leigh, with third member David Gray (Leigh's then-boyfriend) retained as a synth programmer. Gray would later become Orlando's live drummer while Nugent would take over the management of both bands. = Mainstream media attention = The scene began to achieve mainstream media coverage with a feature on Arcadia in Katie Puckrick's Sunday Show featuring live footage of Plastic Fantastic and Sexus (by now a full part of the Romo scene) and interviews with the two aforementioned bands, Xavior from DexDexTer and Simon Price, and queue/crowd/dancefloor footage of Arcadia featuring Wilde, Grey, Chipping, Edwards, Edgren and Leigh.Romo/Arcadia feature on the Sunday Show hosted by Katie Puckrick, BBC2 late 1995, viewable on Youtube By the end of 1995, media coverage of Romo had included TV coverage on ITV, Sky News and an unspecified Japanese TV news programme, radio coverage on BBC Radio 1 and BBC World Service and print media coverage in Time Out, The Observer, The Guardian, The Sunday Times,The Romo Empire, 1995 The Year in Review, Melody Maker 23/30 December 1995 p56 as well as colour features in style magazines The FacePose Who Dare ‚Äì Clubs Section, The Face December 1995 p180 and i-D.Plastic Passion ‚Äì i-D December 1995 \\"The Performance Issue\\"Ridicule is nothing to be scared of ‚Äì i-D December 1995 \\"The Performance Issue\\" Tabloid newspaper the Daily Star also printed an enthusiastic but largely inaccurate full page article depicting the scene as a straightforward New Romantic revival.They're the new romantics and they're DRESSED TO KILT! by Lee Harpin, Daily Star Thursday 26 October 1995 p28 Melody Maker meanwhile continued its enthusiastic coverage, culminating in a cover-featured Romo special defining the scene.

It's to do with the fact that some bands just won't tour with each other, not because they dislike each other, they just have different... living styles.\\" Nevertheless, by the end of the tour, all of the seven core acts originally featured in the Melody Maker special had recording contracts with either major or big independent labels ‚Äì Orlando with WEA subsidiary Blanco y Negro Records, Plastic Fantastic with Mercury Records, Sexus with ZTT, Hollywood with U2's Mother Records label, DexDexTer with Island Records subdivision Trade2, Viva with Planet3 Records and Minty (whose transvestite drummer Trevor Sharpe had filled in as drummer for Plastic Fantastic on the tour) with Candy Records. = 'Death' of Romo = After the tour, Price wrote an editorial in Melody Maker declaring the movement dead as it had achieved its aims but was now being soured by the revivalist portrayal in the mainstream media.Viewpoint by Simon Price, Melody Maker 20 April 1996 p41 Despite this, the scene in London continued with more bands emerging such as Anglo-Japanese female quartet √âtoile√âtoile introductory article by Kristy Barker, Melody Maker 24 June 1996 as well as the arrival in Britain of Donovan Leitch's band Nancy Boy.Nancy Boy live review at Club Skinny by Simon Price, Melody Maker 13 April 1996 p20 Another late major addition to the scene at around this time was Belvedere Kane, fronted by Romo scene face Barry Stone, later of the Jewels And Stone writing/production partnership. In his review of the latter's gig, Price recanted his \\"Romo is dead\\" declaration, dismissing it as a red herring tactic and further adding that the continued spread of Romo was by now beyond even his control.Belverdere Kane at Club Skinny live review by Simon Price, Melody Maker 3 August 1996 At around this time, a first anniversary party was held for Club Skinny headlined by Crush, the band of former Byker Grove TV stars Donna Air and Jayni Hoi. However, continued tensions in the scene led to the discontinuation of both Skinny and Arcadia in July 1996. Romo activities continued at the individual bands' concerts, although one Plastic Fantastic concert at Dingwalls from this time ended in a mass brawl after a hat was thrown onstage.Melody Maker 9 July 1996 p9 Plastic Fantastic also had a residency at the Dublin Castle, Camden during this period, although this was terminated by management after an incident where stage invaders performed a sex show. The bands mostly concentrated on their recording contracts at this point ‚Äì in late 1996 Hollywood released a heavily remixed single Apocalypse Kiss while Plastic Fantastic ‚Äì having previously released the Eno-influenced Fantastique no.5- recorded a planned album Autumn which was never released due to a dispute with Mercury over the mix of planned second single Plastic World. Sexus, who had also released a second single The Official End Of It All and recorded an album The Boyfriend Olympics, similarly fell out with ZTT over the mix of planned third single How Do You Kiss. Personal differences between Xavior and his bandmates led to the demise of DexDexTer in early 1997 just as their single Another Car Another CarCrash was released.\\"The Beginning and The End?\\" -news report on DexDexTer single & split, Melody Maker 11 January 1997 p3 Both parties remained signed tor Trade2; the bandmates as ExDexTer recorded demos for the label but were swiftly dropped as eventually was Xavior in 1998 after he had recorded an unreleased solo album, Chainsaw Mass AppealXavior career history, 2004 and appeared in the film Velvet Goldmine.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120879/fullcredits After several years producing, playing keyboards for Placebo and recording further unreleased solo albums, he would reemerge as a frontman in the late 2000s fronting Paul St Paul and the Apostles with David Ryder Prangley. Viva meanwhile, despite continuing to demo material, never released any records and would later rename themselves Scala 5 and revert to a heavier guitar sound before their demise circa 2000. Stuart Miller dissolved Plastic Fantastic and revived his old band Supercharger, while Hollywood's Hannah Edgren was spotted (by Dickon Edwards) fronting a new band in 1998 ‚Äì she and Stacey Leigh would later reunite as Fubar. Sexus were frozen into inactivity due to a dispute with management after the fallout with ZTT ‚Äì they would eventually re-emerge in 2002 as the Psychodelicates with a download/mail order album Psychodelicates Go Adventuring. Thus by the middle of 1997 it was left to Orlando and Minty to be the most prolific ‚Äì and in that sense the most successful ‚Äì Romo bands as they were the only two of the seven core acts to reach the stage of releasing their respective albums. Orlando, having already released two singles \\"Just for a Second\\" and The Magic EP in late 1996 (the latter of which achieved #96 on the UK Singles ChartMagic EP by Orlando on Official UK Singles Chart) and a third, Nature's Hated in spring 1997, having toured extensively with Kenickie and having scored the only UK Top 75 chart hit of any core Romo act with their contribution to the Fever Pitch soundtrack EP, a cover of Tim Hardin's How Can We Hang On to a Dream, released their album Passive Soul in October that year before Dickon Edwards departed to found Fosca. Tim Chipping would continue to use the Orlando band name for a planned folk-orientated second album under the working title Sick Folk (to have included a collaboration with Kenickie/Rosita members Marie Du Santiago and Emmy-Kate Montrose), before finally dissolving Orlando in Spring 2000. Minty, likewise, having released singles \\"Useless Man\\", \\"Plastic Bag\\" (a No. 2 hit in the Netherlands), \\"That's Nice\\" and \\"Nothing\\", released their parent album Open Wide in late 1997 before also disbanding, with some members later forming rock band The Servant. With all the core bands and major London clubnights now defunct (or at least no longer in their Romo incarnations), the Romo scene effectively came to an end.  Legacy  In Romo's wake over the next several years came a fresh wave of glam/style orientated clubnights. One of the first of these was Club Kitten, the successor to Club Skinny, based at the latter's old location of HQ's in Camden and featuring Stuart Miller as DJ. Another important post-Romo club was Stay Beautiful, run by Simon Price at various London locations from 2000‚Äì2009 and in Brighton 2011-2016. Several other Romo musicians ran glam/style orientated club nights ‚Äì notably Minty vocalist Mathew Glammore's \\"Kashpoint\\" (at a January 2004 instalment of which Glammore performed a medley of old Minty songs and a March 2005 instalment of which featured a Minty reunion),Flyer for Minty Reunion concert at Kashpoint on Kashpoint website Xavior's \\"Hanky Panky Kabaret\\" clubnight (and associated meetings in London's Wolsey restaurant) and Dickon Edwards' \\"Beautiful And Damned\\" and \\"Against Nature\\". Wilde and Nugent would later unleash another scene ‚Äì the Club Rampage/Club P*rnstar \\"Bratpop\\" scene in late 1998 (also the beneficiary of a Melody Maker cover special).Teenage Rampage (Bratpop special cover feature) Melody Maker 15 August 1998 pages 20‚Äì22 Other promoters also hosted such glam/style-orientated clubnights in the 2000s ‚Äì most notably Glam-Ou-Rama, which later relocated to Tel Aviv. Romo Night in Sweden, first established in 1996 during the original London scene's lifetime, was still active as of 2003. Romo was also frequently cited as a precedent for (if not actually an influence on) the electroclash scene of the early 2000s.\\"... just like RoMo before it ‚Äì a proto-Electroclash if there ever was one ...\\" reader's comment on Guardian article on Electroclash The Disciples by James Mollison, a book of photographs of music fans, includes a spread of photos of fans at a London concert by major electroclash act Fischerspooner, mostly dressed in Romo-style attire (one of whom is Simon Price).The Disciples by James Mollison (with foreword by Desmond Morris), Chris Boot 2008 ‚Äì Fischerspooner fans image section Writing and production team Xenomania, who became critically and commercially successful in the 2000s for their work with groups such as Girls Aloud and Sugababes, started out as remixers for songs by several Romo bands, including Hollywood's \\"Apocalypse Kiss\\" and Sexus' \\"How Do You Kiss?\\". According to Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger, writing in 2003, Xenomania's Romo roots could be heard in their then-current work. Writing in 2004 in regards to Xenomania's commercial success, Ewing said: \\"You can find Romo links everywhere if you look!\\" Ewing also compared Hollywood (whose repertoire had included \\"Lost in Moscow 3am\\")Hollywood - The Songs ThisIsRomo.com accessed 17 January 2018 to Russian duo t.A.T.u., who he said were \\"entirely Romo, though it would be more accurate to say that Romo was a spirited runt in a litter that also birthed them.\\"  Musical characteristics  One wing of Romo bands, such as Plastic Fantastic and DexDexTer cleaved towards art-glam. Although actually mostly referencing Brian Eno's Here Come the Warm Jets (particularly the tracks \\"Baby's on Fire\\" and \\"Needles in the Camel's Eye\\"), Fantastique no.5 was reviewed in the NME by Pulp members Russell Senior and Candida Doyle as \\"Ro-mu - as in Roxy Music.

Viva bassist Lee David described how his band's sound \\"came from going to clubs and seeing what got people dancing.\\" Sexus's sound was characterised by Price as \\"intelligent handbag.\\" Musically, Orlando combined the synthesised dance-pop of 1990s boybands and American swingbeat acts with verbose lyrics in the general style of Morrissey and Richey Edwards.

It was his second film after Une Visite in 1955 but it is considered his \\"first short film of any real consequence\\". Truffaut simply called it \\"my first real film\\". Moreover, it was Bernadette Lafont's film debut. She was at that time G√©rard Blain's wife. The film demonstrates already some examples for Truffaut's \\"trademark tracking shots\\" and would \\"help define his style\\" as well as \\"set Truffaut on a path for his career\\". Truffaut's narrative stresses the details of life, hereby establishing one of the traits of the French New Wave. Thus he also became a predecessor of French film directors such as Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Am√©lie). It has been stated that the formation of the French New Wave could be \\"tracked through two short films\\": Jean-Luc Godard's All the Boys Are Called Patrick and Truffaut's Les Mistons. In 2013 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City screened this film together with Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Plot The story takes place in Provencal France, where a group of young boys (\\"mistons\\" roughly translates \\"brats\\") are infatuated with a beautiful young woman. Jealous of her passionate affair, they conspire to make mischief for the woman and her boyfriend. Production The film was shot on location in Bernadette Lafont's hometown N√Æmes in Southern France. It sports the town's Roman arena. It was shot on 35mm film without live sound. DVD release In 1999 the film was released on a DVD which also contained Antoine and Colette. In 2007 Les Mistons was again released, this time as a part of a DVD collection. The extras included an introduction by film historian Serge Toubiana and an audio commentary by Truffaut's assistant, Claude de Givray.

It lies 3 miles southwest of the small town of Eccleshall and about 1 mile west of the village of Woodseaves, both on the A519. Woodseaves is the largest settlement in the parish, which also includes the hamlet of Shebdon to the WSW of High Offley, as well as a number of scattered houses and small farms (such as on Grub Street). The Shropshire Union Canal runs through the parish, to the southwest of the villages of High Offley and Woodseaves, with the Shebdon aqueduct and wharf in the west of the parish, from Shebdon towards Knighton.

He has released music under many names, of which most well known is his solo project, Prometheus, and his collaboration with Twisted Records label colleague, Simon Posford, under the moniker Younger Brother. His music is characterized by distinct basslines, high production quality, intense thematic development and unique or alternative approaches to the psytrance genre. He frequently combines diatonic melodic content with metallic or \\"glitchy\\" percussive polyphonic elements to form thick contrapuntal tapestries of sound. Although much of his music sounds like it was composed using equipment at the forefront of technology, it is not uncommon for him to use equipment now considered antique, such as the 1971 Korg micro synth that he used for portions of the second album, Corridor of Mirrors. Benjamin Vaughan founded a tech startup, called Disciple. Disciple is a community media platform that, unlike Facebook or a website, empowers community hosts to build, manage and control their own private, social apps. The platform gives communities their own mobile meeting spaces to gather and interact in the ways that work for them.  Releases  He has released three albums as Prometheus; Robot-O-Chan (2004), Corridor of Mirrors (2007), and Spike (2010). The albums have been well received by the trance community for their innovation, dancefloor appeal, and their incorporation of non- traditional influences. Robot-O-Chan features two down-tempo tracks, whereas Corridor of Mirrors maintains a consistent trance bent. Younger Brother have released four albums to date, A Flock of Bleeps (released in 2003), The Last Days of Gravity (2007), Vaccine (2011) and Vaccine Electronic. Younger Brother‚Äôs musical output is much more varied than that of Prometheus, with tracks ranging from the psychedelic French ballad, \\"The Receptive,\\" to progressive breakbeats such as \\"Weird on a Monday Night\\", to sounds reminiscent of Pink Floyd on their recent album. On 2 September 2013, his debut solo album Even Tundra was released on Spotify and as a digital download.

His last film role was as the alcoholic director Burke Dennings in The Exorcist (1973). Stage career MacGowran was born on 13 October 1918 in Dublin. He established his professional reputation as a member of the Abbey Players in Dublin, while he achieved stage renown for his knowing interpretations of the works of Samuel Beckett. He appeared as Lucky in Waiting for Godot at the Royal Court Theatre, and with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Endgame at the Aldwych Theatre. He released an LP record titled MacGowran Speaking Beckett to coincide with Samuel Beckett's 60th birthday in 1966, and he won the 1970‚Äì71 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor in the off-Broadway play MacGowran in the Works of Beckett. He also specialised in the work of Se√°n O'Casey, creating the role of Joxer in the Broadway musical Juno in 1959, based on Juno and the Paycock, O'Casey's 1924 play about the Irish Civil War. He played O'Casey's brother Archie in Young Cassidy (1965), one of John Ford's later films (which the director had to abandon due to ill health). In 1954, he moved to London, where he became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. There he struck up a lasting friendship with Peter O'Toole, with whom he later appeared in Richard Brooks' Lord Jim (1965). He apparently had a fractious relationship with Royal Shakespeare director Peter Hall. He was Old Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice, and when the set arrived, Hall called all the cast into the theatre to view it. MacGowran was not there, still in his dressing room. An assistant was sent to fetch him. He returned alone: \\"Mr MacGowran says, Mr. Hall, that if you had read the play you would know that Old Gobbo was blind.\\" MacGowran played the title role of Gandhi in the Broadway play written by Gurney Campbell in 1971, directed by Jose Quintero. Film career MacGowran's film career started in Ireland with the film No Resting Place (1951), and many of his earlier films were set in Ireland. Notably The Quiet Man (1952), The Gentle Gunman (1952), Rooney (1958) and Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959). In 1966 Roman Polanski cast him as the gangster Albie in Cul-de-sac, before creating Professor Abronsius in The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967) especially for him. Other notable film appearances include the Ealing comedy The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953), Tony Richardson's Tom Jones (1963), David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), Richard Lester's How I Won the War (1967), Peter Brook's King Lear, the leading role of Professor Collins in Wonderwall (1968), and Age of Consent (1969). On TV, he appeared in \\"The Happening\\", an episode of The Champions and as professor Poole in The Winged Avenger episode of The Avengers. He played a safecracker opposite Kenneth Cope in \\"The Ghost Talks\\" episode of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). His last film was The Exorcist (1973), where he played Burke Dennings, an alcoholic director and Regan's first victim. Personal life In 1963, he married Aileen Gloria Nugent, daughter of Sir Walter Nugent, Bt., the Irish MP for South Westmeath and Senator of the Irish Free State. Shortly after completing work on The Exorcist, while in New York City appearing as Fluther in Se√°n O'Casey's The Plough and the Stars, MacGowran died at 54 from influenza after complications resulting from the recent London flu epidemic.

Front entrance of Fuerte de San Pedro circa 1900. A view of the Southwest Basti√≥n La Concepci√≥n from the waterfront circa 1900. Fuerte de San Pedro is a military defense structure in Cebu (Philippines), built by the Spanish under the command of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, first governor of the Captaincy General of the Philippines. It is located in the area now called Plaza Indepedencia, in the pier area of the city. The original fort was made of wood and built after the arrival of Legazpi and his expedition. In the early 17th century a stone fort was built to repel Muslim raiders. Today's structure dates from 1738 and is the oldest triangular bastion fort in the country. It served as the nucleus of the first Spanish settlement in the Philippines. During the Philippine Revolution at the end of the 19th century, it was attacked and taken by Filipino revolutionaries, who used it as a stronghold. The fort is triangular in shape, with two sides facing the sea and the third side fronting the land. The two sides facing the sea were defended with artillery and the front with a strong palisade made of wood. The three bastions are named La Concepci√≥n (SW); Ignacio de Loyola (SE), and San Miguel (NE). It has a total inside area of . The walls are high by thick (20 feet high by 8 feet thick), and the towers are high from the ground level. The circumference is . The sides are of unequal lengths and the one fronting the city is where one may find entry into the fort. Fourteen cannons were mounted in their emplacements most of which are still there today. Work first started in 1565 with Miguel Lop√©z de Legazpi breaking ground. Little was known about the activity of the fort from the time it was built until two centuries later in 1739 when the King of Spain, Philip V, desired information regarding the island of Cebu. Governor-general Tam√≥n, who was the Spanish ruler of the islands at the time made the following report: > Fuerte San Pedro, the fort is described as built of stone mortar with a > terreplein where guns are mounted. The fort contains the necessary > buildings. The largest of these buildings was the Cuerpo de Guardia where > the personnel that manned the fort lived. Adjacent to it was the vivienda > del teniente which was the living quarters of the lieutenant of the fort. In > between the aforementioned buildings is a well. At one corner attached to > the walls of the basti√≥n San Miguel (NE) was the Almacenes de P√≥lvora > (powder magazine).Special Places of Interest - Fort San Pedro  Timeline  The date of construction of the stone fort is uncertain, although there are claims that a Jesuit Antonio Campioni built a stone fort in 1630, and the gate of the fort bears the date 1738 together with the arms of Castile and Leon. It is certain, however, that the fort underwent major renovations in the late 19th century as part of a building program to improve Cebu. The victory of the Americans led by Commodore Dewey at the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898 marked the end of the Spanish era in the Philippine Islands. The fort was then surrendered by the Spaniards to the Cebuano revolutionaries. Fort San Pedro became a part of the American Warwick barracks during the American regime. From 1937 to 1941 the barracks was converted into a school where many Cebuanos received their formal education. During World War II from 1942 to 1945, Japanese residents of the city took refuge within the walls. When the battle to liberate the city of Cebu from the Imperial Japanese forces was fought, the fort served as an emergency hospital for the wounded. From 1946 to 1950, Fort San Pedro was an army camp. After 1950, the Cebu Garden Club took over and fixed the inner part and converted it into a miniature garden. Although already in ruins, the upper deck was utilized for different offices. First, as a clinic of the City Health, as office of the Presidential Arm and Community Development then the City Public Works Unit used the ruins of the lieutenant's quarters as its field office. In 1957 mayor Sergio Osme√±a Jr. jolted the public with his announcement to demolish Fort San Pedro and erect on the spot a new City Hall. This started a movement against the demolition idea. Articles voicing opposition appeared in the local dailies and magazines in Cebu City and in Manila. Finally, confronted by civic leaders and society heads at his Cebu City Hall office, he gave up his idea and said he will use instead the space behind the fort. In the very same year, the city council commissioned \\"The Lamplighter\\", a religious sect, to manage a zoo subsidized by the city within the fort courtyard. By 1968, the fa√ßade, quarters and walls of the original structures of Fort San Pedro were so obliterated that only the two towers were recognizable. Plans for the restoration of the fort was started and the zoo was relocated. Plans and estimates for the restoration of the fort were completed by architect Leonardo Concepci√≥n, who had completed his MA in Building restoration in Madrid. The project was jointly funded by the Board of Travel Industry (now Department of Tourism), the Cebu City Government, and the Cebu Zonta Club. The Fort San Pedro restoration was a tedious, time and labor consuming project. To restore the fort as close to the original as possible, coral stones which were hauled from under the sea along Cebu coastal towns were utilized. Delivered crudely cut to the restoration site, the fort laborers did the final cutting and polishing to make the blocks fit each other. Work progressed slowly but the fa√ßade, the main building, (Cuerpo de Guardia), the walk and the observatory roof garden were faithfully restored after one and a half years. To make the project functional; the restored main building serves then as the Cebu Office of the Department of Tourism, the lieutenant's quarters now houses a museum, the inner court is an open-air theater and its immediate vicinity is a park. At present, it is under the care and administration of the city of Cebu, as a historical park under City Executive Order No. 08-87 of February 20, 2008. This order also known as Plaza Independencia - Fort San Pedro Interim Policy and Advisory Board (PIFSIPAB) appointed Hon. Michael L. Rama as overall overseer of the Plaza Independencia and Fort San Pedro.http://www.cebucity.gov.ph/deptsoffices/frontline/fortsanpedro The land on which it is situated is, however, owned by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. These days, part of the fort is a museum. Inside the fort houses the legacies of the Spanish Government: well preserved Spanish artefacts such as Spanish documents, paintings and sculpture. A large statue of Legazpi and Antonio Pigafetta may be seen outside the fort walls. Inside Fort San Pedro Facing Entrance, August 2010.

The village is on the gentle slopes of the low western end of the North Downs range, and has the remains of a Roman villa. Despite the English Reformation, Winchester Cathedral (or its Dean and Chapter) held the chief manors representing much of its land from 975 until 1861. A large collection of Anglo-Saxon and Merovingian coins found in the parish has become known as the Crondall Hoard. Toponymy Various earlier spellings have the intuitive, post-Norman spelling of \\"u\\" instead of \\"o\\" and the village is still pronounced as it has been for centuries by rooted residents or by those who correctly abstract the sound from 'front': in the 10th century 'Crundelas' was recorded; throughout the 14th century it was 'Crundale'. An Old English crundel was a chalk-pit or lime quarry, and the word has survived in the name of Crondall. The remains of one quarry can still be seen as a large depression on the golf course. History =Pre-Norman= Crondall's southern boundary is the North Downs along which ran the prehistoric Harrow Way, an ancient unpaved route in Britain which ran from the Cornish tin mines to Dover in Kent. Near this stretch of today's Pilgrims' Way is evidence for neolithic settlements: an Iron Age earthworks at Caesar's Camp. Remains of Roman settlements have been found close beside the Harrow Way near Barley Pound. Evidence for Roman occupation can be found in the fields as broken tiles and artefacts. In 1817 an intact Roman mosaic pavement was found by a ploughman, 200 yards north of Barley Pound Farm and which is commemorated by a tapestry in the parish church. Coins from the third century were found in 1869. King Alfred the Great bequeathed the Hundred of Crondall to his nephew √Üthelhelm in 885. In 975 it was handed over by King Edgar to the monks at Winchester and remained in their hands until 1539. At this time Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries and within two years Crondall was controlled by the new Dean and Chapter of Winchester Cathedral. Crondall remained in their hands until 1861, when it was taken over by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Crondall Hoard The Crondall Hoard of one hundred and one old French and Anglo-Saxon coins, two jewelled ornaments, and a chain was found in 1828. Some of these date to the fifth century and ninety seven of the coins are now in the possession of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. The hoard was deposited after c. 630; of its 101 gold coins, 69 were Anglo-Saxon and 24 were Merovingian or Frankish., p. 161, p. 84 Crondall Hundred The map of Hampshire in the 1722 edition of William Camden's Britannia or Geographical Description of Britain and Ireland shows symbols for major habitation in Farnborough, Cove, Ewshot, Aldershot and Crookham in the Crundhal (Crondall) hundred, a strategic collection of lands with a meeting place at which the wealthy and powerful would convene as needs require, and which came to hold Hundred Courts, a level above the Manorial courts.Samuel Lewis' A Topographical Dictionary of England of 1831 Ewshot and Crookham remained in the parish and hundred of Crondall The Hundred of Crondall was divided into 'Manors', Itchell, Ewshot, Crokeham/Crookham Well, Feldmead, Dippenhall, Farnborough and Aldershot. These Manors are all mentioned in the records of Winchester Cathedral. All the land within the Hundred was administered by a steward landowner at Crondall on behalf of \\"the monks of St Swithen\\" and later on behalf of Winchester Cathedral. =Evolution of the estate= By the early 19th century the cathedral as manorial owner owned the pick of the surrounding five tithings, the last three of which came to be villages: Crondall, Swanthorpe, and portions of Dippenhall, Church Crookham and Ewshot. This contrasted with lesser agricultural fertility land, much of which was common land and which was no longer connected with the manor. =Itchell Manor= The Giffard/Gifford of Itchel(l) family acquired a Coat of Arms in the Middle Ages. Itchell Manor's gardens (house demolished 1954) were laid out by Capability Brown. A greenhouse, built 1840, is still in use and a Tudor Gateway remains. John Gifford died seised of the manor in 1563, leaving a son George, then aged 10 years. A third part of the manor passed to his widow who married William Hodges of Weston Sub Edge. In 1579, shortly after George Giffard came of age, Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, desiring to add it to his neighbouring estate of Dogmersfield, purchased the estate. After 1628 the estate passed through several hands and in the 18th still had these closes/farmstead localities technically in its freehold: The Hyde, Little Potter's Fore, Earlins, Two Downs, Tanley, Green Park, Park Corner, Dean's Piddle, Old Hop Garden. =Civil War= All Saints' Church in Crondall was a minor parliamentary outpost for much of the English Civil War, guarding the western approaches to Farnham. =Tithe map= A Tithe Map of The Hundred of Crondall, dated 1846, is housed at the Hampshire County Archive in Winchester. Industry Crondall has for centuries been rich farming land. A great variety of soils appear in the area because it lies on the edge of the London Basin including chalk, clay and heavy fertile loam. There are many natural springs in the area that were used as watercress beds and for growing osier trees for basket weaving. Some of the baskets were incorporated into the balloon baskets and airship gondolas used by S.F. Cody in his early aviation experiments at Farnborough. For two centuries up to the Second World War, the area was also renowned for hops. For many years Crondall had a brickworks that supplied tiles and brick to local towns. Architecture =Barley Pound, Motte and Bailey= Barley Pound Barley Pound is a large ring-motte with four baileys and is one of the best examples of a ring and bailey fortress in Hampshire. The fortification may be the \\"Lidelea Castle\\" which was mentioned in the Gesta Stephani for 1147, when it was besieged and captured by King Stephen. After its return to Henry of Blois, Bishop of Wincheter it was abandoned in favour of Farnham Castle. Archaeological work has uncovered evidence of an 8-inch thick wall along with a masonry keep. To the east is Powderham CastleNot to be confused with Powderham Castle in Devon which was a siege-castle to Barley Pound. It too was founded by the Bishop of Winchester and built during The Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen. It was originally an earth and timber ringwork fortress, encased by a ditch and with a counterscarp bank. Due to the demolition of its encasing rampart, the ringwork now resembles a low flat-topped motte. It now also has a dense cover of trees. Excavations on the mound have uncovered post-holes and large flints which may indicate former buildings. =All Saints, Norman Church= All Saints Church The 12th-century Norman parish church, All Saints, which operates as part of the Parish of Crondall and Ewshot, has been called 'The Cathedral of North Hampshire'. It replaced a Saxon church on the same site and the Saxon font remains from that period. The east end of the Nave dates to 1170. The original bell tower was poorly designed for the weight of the bells it housed and by 1657 the whole tower had to be dismantled to prevent its total collapse. In 1659 a new brick tower, modelled on St Matthews in Battersea, was erected at the NE corner of the original structure. Among notable interior features are an early brass of 1370, the dogtooth mouldings of the chancel arch and the imposing arcades and foliate capitals of the Nave. To date All Saints has undergone two major restorations, the first in 1847 by the architect Benjamin Ferrey and the second in 1871 under the guidance of Sir George Gilbert Scott. In 1995 the \\"National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies\\" (NADFAS) declared All Saints to be one of the finest examples of architecture of its style in the country. There have been reported sightings of the ghosts of Parliamentarian soldiers, including a mounted Roundhead in full battle dress, in the churchyard, following the use of the church as a minor outpost during the English Civil War. =Other buildings= Throughout Crondall there are many well-preserved old houses and cottages. The Plume of Feathers pub is an example of Tudor architecture and was a resting stop on the turnpike to Portsmouth. Notable visitors and residents A panoramic view of this part of Hampshire may be gained from Queens View looking from East to West across Crondall. It takes its name from the fact that Queen Victoria admired this view whilst inspecting troops garrisoned at nearby Aldershot \\"Home of the British Army\\". Oliver Cromwell is reputed to have stayed in the Plume of Feathers in October 1645, when the siege of Basing House was in progress.Plume of Feathers, Crondall Notable residents include Field Marshall Edwin Bramall, former Head of the British Army and D-Day veteran and Chris Fawkes, a weatherman for the BBC. Statistics According to the 2001 census, 3463 people lived in Crondall. * There were 1478 households in the ward. * The parish covers 10.7 square miles (27.7 km2).

Cutaway model of Danfoss's first automatic valve  History  = Beginning (1933-1966) = In 1933 Mads Clausen (1905-1966) founded Dansk K√∏leautomatik- og Apparatfabrik, later in 1946 the company name was changed to Danfoss. The first product was an expansion valve for refrigeration units, it was developed after studying imported valves from the US. In 1941, activities are expanded to products for heating. The thermostatic radiator valve was invented by Mads Clausen in 1943, later patented, and in 1952 promoted as an energy saving device. In 1962 the company started production of power electronics, the first product was custom- built rectifiers, later in 1968 production of the VLT Frequency converter began, the first of its kind in the world. The company also expands its activities into hydraulics, the first hydraulic component is produced on the factory in Nordborg in 1964. Mads Clausen died in 1966, at only 60. Since the sons are still too young to take over the company, Bitten Clausen took on the role as head of the board. The company had yearly sales of 500 million Danish kroner, and the factory had grown to 10.000 m¬≤. The office of Mads Clausen as he left it in 1962 = Since 1966 = Expansion into other countries started in 1956, when the company started to build a factory in Flensburg, Germany, which was completed in 1958. China is also an important market for Danfoss. In 2013, two new factories were opened on the same day, bringing the number to seven. The Chinese market was the third largest for the company. Activities The Danfoss Group manufactures products and provides services used in: * cooling food * air conditioning * heating buildings * variable-frequency drives * gas compressors * powering mobile machinery. Danfoss employs approximately 28,000 people worldwide with its headquarters in Nordborg, Denmark. In 2002 Danfoss joined the United Nations Global Compact, consisting of nine principles with social and environmental responsibility. Bitten og Mads Clausens Fond was established as a self-governing institution in 1971 by Bitten Clausen. Today, the foundation is the biggest shareholder in the company.  Controversy  = World War II = In 2010, some Danish newspapers reported that Danfoss was selling its products to Nazi Germany during World War II. They quoted the book Krigens k√∏bm√¶nd (\\"Mercents of War\\") by Christian Jensen, Tomas Kristiansen and Karl Erik Nielsen, who stated that Danfoss sold goods to the occupuing forces for 408,850 Danish kroner. According to Ole Daugbjerg from Danfoss, they did not trade directly with the Germans. Later in 2001, it was cleared in the book Danfoss under bes√¶ttelsen (\\"Danfoss during the Occupation\\") by Ditlev Tamm although other critics have claimed the book might not be neutral because Tamm was paid by Danfoss to perform the investigations. = Cartel = On December 7, 2011, Danfoss was fined 90 million euro for exercising a cartel with Embraco / Whirlpool Corporation, Panasonic, ACC and Tecumseh Products. The cooperation was entered with compressors from April 2004 to October 2007. The basis of the is the violation of free competition to the detriment of consumers. Danfoss was fined 16.5 million Danish kroner in the United States. From October 2004 to 2007, the German subsidiary also entered illegal price agreements with competitors.

It lies southeast of Frankfurt am Main in the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region and has the greatest population of any municipality in the Offenbach district. It came into being in 1979 when the greater community of Rodgau was raised to town, after having been formed through a merger of five formerly self-administering communities in the framework of municipal reform in Hesse in 1977. The current constituent communities‚Äô history reaches back to the 8th century.  Geography  = Location = Rodgau's location in the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region Rodgau's town limits and built-up area Rodgau is part of the metropolitan area known as the Rhein-Main-Gebiet in German, one of Germany's economically strongest areas. The fiftieth parallel of north latitude (50¬∞N) passes right through Puiseaux-Platz (square) in Nieder-Roden. The town lies on the so-called Untermainebene, or Lower Main Plain, the northern outlying part of the Rhine rift. The flat land around Rodgau is set against hillier country in the nearby Spessart, Taunus, Vogelsberg, Odenwald and Bergstra√üe, which all serve as recreational areas for the people. The state boundary with neighbouring Bavaria runs only a few kilometres away, at the Main. About a third of the municipal area is made up of woodland, and another third of land under agricultural use and of open water, while the remaining third is built up with residential and commercial areas and transport facilities. The brook, the Rodau, runs for 15 km through the whole municipal area. Climatically the area is among Germany's mildest and least rainy areas (mean yearly measurements for 1982-2004: 10.5 ¬∞C, 639.1 mm).Deutscher Wetterdienst Offenbach = Neighbouring communities = Rodgau borders in the north on the towns of Heusenstamm and Obertshausen, in the east on the community of Hainburg and the town of Seligenstadt, in the southeast on the town of Babenhausen and the community of Eppertshausen (both in Darmstadt-Dieburg), in the southwest on the town of R√∂dermark and in the west on the town of Dietzenbach. = Constituent communities = Rodgau's Stadtteile are Weiskirchen, Hainhausen, J√ºgesheim, Dudenhofen and Nieder-Roden with its own Ortsteil of Rollwald.  History  = Town‚Äôs founding = On 1 January 1977, in the course of municipal reform in Hesse,Gesetz zur Neugliederung des Landkreises Offenbach vom 26. Juni 1974 GVBl. I S. 316; ¬ß 6 Stadt Rodgau the greater community of Rodgau came into being as the communities of Weiskirchen, Hainhausen, J√ºgesheim, Dudenhofen and Nieder-Roden, along with the settlement of Rollwald belonging to Nieder-Roden were amalgamated. The greater community was granted town rights on 15 September 1979. The old cropfield name Rodgau, like Bachgau and Kinziggau belonging to the Maingau, gave the town its name. The original communities, though, have existed for hundreds of years. Today (as at 31 December 2007), Rodgau has 45,236 inhabitants (including 2,035 whose main residence is elsewhere), of whom 22,120 are male and 23,116 female. Foreigners from 52 different nations account for 4,471 inhabitants (9.9%). Those who have lived in Rodgau longer than ten years account for 64.6% of the population.Einwohnermeldeamt Stadt Rodgau = Weiskirchen = The Rodau on Weiskirchen's outskirts Waterwheel in Weiskirchen View from the watertower over Hainhausen towards Frankfurt Around Saint Peter's Church (Peterskirche) arose the settlement of Wichenkirchen (or Wizzinkirchin) in Frankish times as a thorpe (one-street village). It had its first documentary mention in 1287 in the Seligenstadt Monastery's accord with the Auheimer Mark. Weiskirchen was at this time Mother Church to the villages of J√ºgesheim, Hainhausen and Rembr√ºcken. The first landlords, the Lords of Hagenhausen ‚Äì later of Eppstein ‚Äì sold the Amt of Steinheim in 1425 along with Weiskirchen, a village belonging to it, to the Archbishop and Elector of Mainz, to whom the village belonged until 1803. With this, Weiskirchen formed an ecclesiastical and economic hub in the Rodgau. When the Auheimer Mark (a communally held parcel of land to which belonged several villages) was divided up in 1786, Weiskirchen received a share of the forest. After Secularization in 1803, the Amt of Steinheim along with Weiskirchen passed to Hesse. In 1896 the Rodgaubahn (railway) with a railway station in Weiskirchen opened. In the course of the 19th century, Weiskirchen shifted from a farming village to a worker's community. Of the once well known village with its timber-frame houses very little is left. During National Socialist times, the small Jewish community was driven out. In March 2005, the small, restored former synagogue was ceremoniously reopened as a memorial. Since 1967, the Weiskirchen transmitter, a medium-wave transmitter owned by Hessischer Rundfunk, has been in operation on Weiskirchen's northwestern outskirts on a frequency of 594 kHz although this has now been dismantled.  Population development  In 1576, Weiskirchen had 37 households. In 1681, 111 inhabitants lived in 26 households. In 1834, 655 people lived in the village. A century later, in 1939, that figure had risen to 1,740. By 1970, the population had risen to 4,840 inhabitants. In late 2007, the constituent community had 6,115 inhabitants. = Hainhausen = As early as 1108, Rodgau's smallest constituent community (with a population today of roughly 3,800) had a documentary mention as the location of a moated castle belonging to the Lords of Hagenhausen, in which it was named as Haginhusen. Remains of this castle still lie under a meadow near the Rodau on today's Burgstra√üe (road). The Hagenhausen noble family, who after moving to the Taunus began styling themselves the Lords of Eppstein, and writing many a page in mediaeval German history, found themselves holding great importance and power from the 13th century onwards. Four Archbishops of Mainz alone were installed by the Eppsteins. Hainhausen, though, did not benefit from the former lords‚Äô descendants‚Äô lordliness. In 1425, the Lords of Eppstein sold the Amt of Steinheim along with Hainhausen to the Archbishop and Elector of Mainz. Its low point came, as it did for all the surrounding villages too, in the Thirty Years' War, at which time the Plague also raged among the population. The survivors besought the patron saint of Plague sufferers, Saint Roch for help. The end of the deadly epidemic is still celebrated today every year on 16 August with a procession, whose destination was originally the Rochus-Kapelle (‚ÄúSaint Roch‚Äôs Chapel‚Äù), consecrated in 1692. Nowadays, though, the newer Rochus-Kirche (‚ÄúSaint Roch‚Äôs Church‚Äù), standing at a different site in the heart of the community, serves as the procession's endpoint, and has since the late 19th century. Saint Roch's Church houses as an art history treasure a piet√† from the mid 14th century which depicts in sculpture Mary and Jesus after he has been taken down from the Cross. After Secularization in 1803, Hainhausen passed to Hesse.  Population development  In 1681, 101 inhabitants lived in 18 households. In 1834, there were 341 inhabitants in Hainhausen. In 1939, this had risen to 835 inhabitants. In 1970, Hainhausen had 2,051 inhabitants. In late 2007 the constituent community had 3,820 inhabitants. = J√ºgesheim = View of J√ºgesheim with watertower St. Nikolaus in J√ºgesheim Founded as a clump village, today's constituent community had its first documentary mention in 1261 under the name Guginsheim. One of Charlemagne‚Äôs V√∂gte (singular: Vogt) named Gugin or Guginhart was supposedly the namesake. Other forms of the name used over the course of the Middle Ages were Gugesheym, Goge√üheym, Goginsheym, and Gugesheim. In the local speech, J√ºgesheim is sometimes still called Giesem today. J√ºgesheim was founded in Frankish times, or more particularly in Merovingian times (between 481 and 560). Near the old Roman roads in the Maingau woods, which crossed near J√ºgesheim, the Franks built new military colonies to control the land. In the Middle Ages, the surrounding woodlands belonged to the Wildbann Dreieich, a royal hunting forest, one of whose 30 Wildhuben (special estates whose owners were charged with guarding the hunting forest) was maintained in J√ºgesheim. In 1425, the Lords of Eppstein sold the Amt of Steinheim along with J√ºgesheim to the Archbishop and Elector of Mainz. The Thirty Years' War took a heavy toll on the community, which at that time was part of the R√∂dermark (communal lands). The place only recovered in the 17th century. In the 20th century it established a leather industry with many workers working leather at home. Besides this there were of course many farming households. After Secularization in 1803, J√ºgesheim passed to Hesse. In 1896 the Rodgaubahn (railway) with a railway station in J√ºgesheim opened. In the mid-1970s, a commercial area was laid out, which over the years that followed further grew. The new Town Hall made J√ºgesheim into a centre of Rodgau. Today Rodgau's second biggest constituent community has some 11,700 inhabitants. North of the constituent community between Hainhausen and J√ºgesheim is found the 43.5 m-tall watertower built in the years from 1936 to 1938. It was in use until 1979, and is now under monumental protection. It has become a kind of landmark for J√ºgesheim, and indeed for all Rodgau.  Population development  In 1576 J√ºgesheim had 36 households. In 1681, 121 persons lived in only 26 households. In 1834, the village had 1,071 inhabitants. In the 20th century this rose to 3,174 in 1939, and to 7,673 in 1970. In late 2007 the constituent community had 11,855 inhabitants. = Dudenhofen = Evangelical church Dudenhofen was founded in the second wave of Frankish settlement, after the time of the partition of the empire in 561. The place was founded at a newly built road junction in an expanded road network, at the expense of the former hub at J√ºgesheim. The placename relates to a personal name Tuoto or Dodo. Dudenhofen had its first documentary mention in 1278 in an accord from Archbishop Werner von Eppstein of Mainz with the Lords of Eppstein. The village long belonged to various owners at the same time (the Lords of Falkenstein, Hanau, Isenburg and Electoral Mainz), the odd part was bequeathed, others were traded or mortgaged (complete with inhabitants). Between 1450 and 1736, Dudenhofen belonged to the County of Hanau-Lichtenberg and was assigned to the Amt of Babenhausen, thereby making the place as of 1550 an Evangelical enclave surrounded by Catholic neighbours. The Counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg died out in 1736, whereupon Hesse-Darmstadt and Hesse-Kassel found themselves at odds over the village. In 1771, Dudenhofen was annexed by the County of Hesse-Kassel. Above the main entrance to the Baroque Evangelical church is therefore found Hesse-Kassel's coat of arms. Underneath the arms is the inscription Was unter Hessens Lust Erbprinz Wilhelm gebaut, sei Dir, o wahrer Gott, zur Pflege nun vertraut (‚ÄúThat built under Hesse‚Äôs desire Hereditary Prince William, be it trusted unto Thee, O true God, for its care‚Äù). Meant here is William IX. In 1807, the Amt of Babenhausen along with Dudenhofen passed to French administration. In 1811, Dudenhofen was absorbed into the Grand Duchy of Hesse. In 1896 the Rodgaubahn (railway) with a railway station in Dudenhofen opened. In the 18th and 19th centuries, many young men emigrated to the Americas to seek their fortune. Today, agriculture, except for asparagus growing, plays no further r√¥le.  Population development  In the Thirty Years' War, the village's population suffered great losses. In 1622 alone, 155 of the 430 inhabitants lost their lives. In 1631 the Plague claimed 104 victims. Only 26 inhabitants lived to see the war end. In 1681, Dudenhofen had 38 households and 139 inhabitants. In 1834 there were 1,139 people in the village, almost all Evangelical but for one long established Jewish family, the Reinhardt family, that was driven out of the village in 1938 shortly after Kristallnacht. In 1939 there were 2,120 inhabitants and in 1970, 4,628. In late 2007 the constituent community had 7,967 inhabitants. = Nieder-Roden = The centre that is now Rodgau's biggest constituent community had its first documentary mention as early as 786 when the Rotaha Monastery was bequeathed to the Lorsch Abbey. The name might go back to the Siedlung auf einer gerodeten Aue (‚ÄúSettlement on a cleared floodplain‚Äù), but it is also likely that it comes from the Rodau, which runs through the community, and which rises in Rotliegend near Urberach. During floods, it was once known to run red (rot in German). Whereabouts the monastery lay is to this day unknown. Finds, however, confirm that people were settling in what is now Nieder-Roden long before the Christian Era. In the Middle Ages, the surrounding woodlands belonged to the Wildbann Dreieich, a royal hunting forest, one of whose 30 Wildhuben (special estates whose owners were charged with guarding the hunting forest) was maintained in Nieder-Roden. Nieder-Roden had another documentary mention in 791 when the Frankish nobleman Erlulf donated all his holdings in Nieder-Roden (rotahen inferiore), Ober-Roden (rotahen superiore) and Bieber to the Lorsch Abbey. In 1346 the village became an independent parish, although in the years that followed it still remained in a certain dependency relationship with its former mother parish of Ober-Roden. Boules and chess under planetrees in Nieder-Roden Formerly an Eppstein holding, the place belonged from 1425 to 1803 to the Archbishopric of Mainz and enjoyed great importance as the centre of a tithing area and the seat of a tithe court. In 1803, the village, as part of the Amtsvogtei of Dieburg, ended up with the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, the later Grand Duchy of Hesse. When the R√∂dermark (a communally held parcel of land to which belonged several villages) was divided up in 1818, Nieder-Roden received a share of the forest. In 1832, Nieder-Roden passed to the Offenbach district. From 1874 to 1977, the community was in the Dieburg district. In 1896 the Rodgaubahn (railway) with a railway station in Nieder-Roden opened. In the Second World War, during the National Socialist r√©gime, there arose a penal and prison camp, the Lager Rollwald (‚ÄúRollwald Camp‚Äù) on the land now occupied by the Rollwald community. After the war, Nieder-Roden grew, especially in the 1960s and 1970s from 2,500 inhabitants to now almost 16,000. In the course of district reform in Hesse in 1977, the community was transferred from the Dieburg district to the Offenbach district, to which the town of Rodgau also belongs.  Population development  In 1576 there were 66 households. In 1681, 117 people lived in only 29 households. In 1829 Nieder-Roden had 787 inhabitants. In 1939, this had risen to 3,616 and by 1970 the number had reached 11,033. In late 2007 the constituent community had 15,479 inhabitants.  Politics  Apportionment of seats on Rodgau town council Town council, as the highest political body in Rodgau, is elected every five years by eligible citizens. The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results: CDU 47.7%, SPD 31.1%, GR√úNE 9.9%, B√ºrger/FWG 4.2%, FDP 3.9%, Deutsche Liste 3.2%.Wahlamt Kreis Offenbach in Dietzenbach This has further yielded the following seat apportionment: CDU = 22, SPD = 14, Gr√ºne = 4, B√ºrger/FWG = 2, FDP = 2, Deutsche Liste = 1. The CDU and FDP work together and between them have a three-vote majority in local government. These two parties are also the ones from which the two full-time members of the town executive come. These are each elected for six-year terms. In late November 2006, three members from the CDU faction were excluded and since then have formed a further faction, styling themselves the CSG (Christlich Soziale Gruppe). This altered the seat apportionment and therefore the majority relationship as follows: CDU = 19, CSG = 3, SPD = 14, Gr√ºne = 4, B√ºrger/FWG = 2, FDP = 2, Deutsche Liste = 1\\\\. Town council furthermore chooses eight of its members to sit on the town executive (Magistrat), two full-time and the other six part-time. The mayor, who is directly elected by the citizenry every six years, chairs the executive. The five constituent communities‚Äô concerns are handled through local councils in each one. These, however, have only an advisory function at town council, and seats are apportioned according to election results in each constituent community. Political bodies sit in the session chamber at Town Hall, which was completed in 1988 and stands in the constituent community of J√ºgesheim. = Coat of arms = left The town's arms can be blazoned thus: Party per bend sinister azure a rose argent surmounted by a heart gules, itself surmounted by a Latin cross sable, gules a wheel spoked of six of the second, surmounting the parting a bend sinister wavy of the second, itself surmounted by five mullets of five of the fourth. In 1978, the then greater community of Rodgau was granted a coat of arms. The German blazon reads: Das Wappen zeigt in Blau und in Rot einen gewellten silbernen Schr√§glingsbalken, belegt mit f√ºnf Sternen, begleitet oben rechts von einer silbernen Rose mit silbernen Kelchbl√§ttern, diese belegt mit einem roten Herzen, dem ein schwarzes Kreuz aufliegt (Lutherrose), unten links von einem sechsspeichigen silbernen Mainzer Rad.Regierungspr√§sidium Darmstadt The escutcheon is divided in half by a wavy bend beginning at the upper sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side. This symbolizes the Rodau, which runs through the whole municipal area. The five mullets (stars) stand for the five constituent communities. On the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side stands the ‚ÄúLuther rose‚Äù as a charge. This recalls Dudenhofen's time as an Evangelical enclave surrounded by Catholic neighbours. On the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is the Wheel of Mainz, borrowed from the arms borne by the Archbishops of Mainz. This recalls the time when Electoral Mainz succeeded the Lords of Eppstein in all constituent communities in 1425. Mainz's overlordship lasted in most constituent communities until Secularization in the early 19th century, but in Dudenhofen ended as early as the 17th century. Until 1977, each constituent community had its own coat of arms as a self- administering community. Weiskirchen left (Granted in 1958) The four waterwheels refer to the mills that were once found in Weiskirchen, and the white churchtower is canting, referring to the community's name, from the German for ‚Äúwhite church‚Äù. Hainhausen left (Granted in 1954) The arms show a stylized image of the former moated castle that once stood on the Rodau's right bank south of the road that leads to Weiskirchen, and that was once the family seat of the Lords of Hainhausen, who were first mentioned in 1122. Out of this family grew the Eppstein dynasty, whose arms with three chevronnets are included here in an inescutcheon. The tinctures silver and red refer to the arms borne by the Archbishops of Mainz, into whose ownership the village was sold in 1425. J√ºgesheim left (Granted in 1955) The charges in these arms, both the oak sprig and the pair of hart's horns, were chosen to recall the days when J√ºgesheim was part of the Wildbann (royal hunting forest). The silver and red here likewise refer to the Wheel of Mainz arms borne by the Archbishops of Mainz. Dudenhofen left (Granted in 1954) The three chevronnets recall the community's former allegiance to the County of Hanau. Below these is the Luther rose, which recalls Dudenhofen's time as an Evangelical enclave surrounded by Catholic neighbours. This charge is now also in the town's arms. Nieder-Roden left (Granted in 1949) The churchtower shown in these arms is the one found at the local church, and is interesting from an art-history point of view. It is flanked in the arms by two inescutcheons, the chevronnets borne by the Lords of Eppstein on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side, and the Wheel of Mainz borne by the Archbishops of Mainz on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side. These stand for former feudal overlords. = Town partnerships = Puiseaux, Loiret, France since 1974 (originally with Nieder-Roden) * Hainburg an der Donau, Bruck an der Leitha district, Austria since 1974 (originally with Nieder-Roden) * Nieuwpoort, West Flanders, Belgium since 1975 (originally with Dudenhofen) * Donja Stubica, Krapina-Zagorje County, Croatia since 2002 On 25 May 1974, the mayors Hans Elgner (Nieder-Roden), Georges Bordry (Puiseaux) and Hubert Rein (Hainburg an der Donau) signed the partnership documents at the Nieder-Roden community centre.  Economy and infrastructure  = Economic development = Asparagus field in Dudenhofen Much as agriculture may have defined life in the formerly self-administering communities until the early 19th century, this changed with creeping industrialization, above all that in Offenbach. Most farmers took work in the nearby cities of Offenbach and Frankfurt and thereafter ran their farms only as a sideline. In the mid 20th century, many small and midsize businesses in the leatherworking industry set up shop in the Rodgau's communities. Its products ‚Äì handbags, suitcases, belts, wallets and purses ‚Äì were made mostly in private homes as a kind of cottage industry. By 1975, this had led to the almost complete disappearance of the farming sideline. In 2004, only eleven farms were still being worked as main income earners, mostly to grow asparagus, and four were still being worked as a sideline. Besides leatherworking, metalworking also locally became a field of endeavour at roughly the same time to supply belt buckles, suitcase handles and suchlike. Major works were located in Weiskirchen, J√ºgesheim and Nieder-Roden. Nowadays, though, leatherware manufacturing and metalworking play only a subordinate r√¥le. In 1954, a new field of industry for this region established itself on Dudenhofen's outskirts, the Dudenhofen Sand Lime Works (Kalksandsteinwerk Dudenhofen), which quarried the fine dune sand available there for making up to 73 million bricks in one year. In the 1990s the company shifted its production focus to manufacturing porous concrete presicion blocks (Plansteine), today known under the name Porit. Aerial photograph of the Opel Test Centre in Dudenhofen High-speed track at the Opel Test Centre In the early 1960s, Adam Opel AG chose Dudenhofen as the location for their test centre, which came into service in 1966. In the middle of a 4.8 km-long high- speed loop track are found a crash-test facility and a 6.7 km-long test track with all conceivable road types for longterm tests. Beginning in the 1960s, Rodgau opened up six major industrial parks with a combined area of 219 ha in which settled mainly service businesses such as the IBM product distribution centre (until 2005, thereafter Mann-Mobilia logistics centre), the firm Atlas Rhein Main, the FEGRO wholesale market, MEWA Textilservice, GEODIS, Pepsi-Cola Deutschland, PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences and a DHL postal freight centre. All together, in mid-2005, there were reported to be 3,871 businesses in Rodgau, among them 23 supermarkets from the best known chains and 16 hotels with 795 beds. The trend of shifting from producing industries and crafts to service industries became clear when 2003 is compared to 1987: ten years after the greater community was founded, service industries comprised 52% of the economy, but this share rose over the next 15 years to 73%.Stadt Rodgau Wirtschaftsf√∂rderung In Rodgau, roughly 150 high technology companies are resident. Dominating the technological field is information and communications technology for aviation and space travel, followed by sensor, measuring, control and analytical technology. Furthermore, production technology, automatic surface finishing, microelectronics and optoelectronics are also represented.Rodgau im Zeichen der Innovation, Heft 1, 2006 In 2005, Rodgau's commercial operations made available all together 9,076 jobs on the social insurance rolls. Moreover, there were roughly 3,000 jobs for the self- employed, officials and those marginally employed. A great number of Rodgau's working people have jobs in the nearby cities: Frankfurt am Main (25 km away), Frankfurt Airport (30 km away), Offenbach am Main (15 km away), Hanau (15 km away), Darmstadt (20 km away) and Aschaffenburg (20 km away). = Transport = Rodgau's transport connections S-Bahn line S1 at Rodgau-J√ºgesheim Bundesstra√üe 45 in Rodgau-J√ºgesheim  Local public transport  Since 14 December 2003, all Rodgau's constituent communities have been linked to the broad network of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn by the extension of line S1 from Wiesbaden to Ober-Roden. Until that time, Rodgau had been served by the Rodgaubahn (railway). There is regular bus service to the railway stations at Nieder-Roden and J√ºgesheim on the S1 through district buslines to Babenhausen, Seligenstadt, Dietzenbach and Langen and town buslines to Hainhausen, Weiskirchen and Rollwald. = Cycle path network = The town of Rodgau is slowly finding at its disposal a network of cycle paths which are being laid out in collaboration with the Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club (‚ÄúGeneral German Bicycle Club‚Äù, ADFC), and which link all five constituent communities together. Since 2005, the signposted Rodgau-Rundweg has run through fields and woods right round the town. At 42.1 km in length it runs to almost marathon distance. On both sides of the S-Bahn line, a 14 km-long, asphalt-paved cycle path from Rollwald to Weiskirchen links all constituent communities. Special bicycle parking places with stands and lockable rental boxes are to be found at every S-Bahn station. = Pedestrian precincts = Pedestrian precincts have been laid out in Nieder-Roden between the S-Bahn station and Puiseauxplatz (square) and in J√ºgesheim on Rodgau-Passage. Areas with much reduced traffic with their attendant paving can be found in all constituent communities, mostly in the old community cores and in new development areas. Walking paths through the Rodau-Aue in Dudenhofen and J√ºgesheim, partly laid out like a park, are reserved for pedestrians. An extensive network of signposted hiking trails threads its way through fields and woods in Rodgau's municipal area. = Roads = In Rodgau's north, the A 3 (Frankfurt-W√ºrzburg) runs through the municipal area and crosses Bundesstra√üe 45 (Hanau-Dieburg), which has been expanded to expresswaylike proportions, and which runs north- south, touching all constituent communities, and has four interchanges. The Weiskirchen service centre within Rodgau town limits on the A 3 can be reached by drivers going in either direction. Adjoining the northern rest area is a motel. With the A 3's extension from Offenbach to W√ºrzburg in the 1960s, both service centres, for the first time in Germany, were outfitted as automats. This concept, however, was abandoned in the early 1980s and they were converted to self-service restaurants. The western residential areas are linked by the 11 km-long Rodgau-Ring-Stra√üe (ringroad), which in the north runs on to Heusenstamm and Offenbach. The Dietzenbach-Rodgau-Seligenstadt cross-district road links Rodgau once again to the A 3\\\\. Weiskirchen is furthermore linked to the A 3 through the Obertshausen interchange. Since 2001, six heavily used intersections within Rodgau town limits have been replaced with roundabouts with raised, plant-covered islands. To reduce traffic in residential areas, four further, small roundabouts have been built. = Parking = At the bathing lake in Nieder-Roden there are roughly 2,000 parking places right near the entrance to the bathing beach. At all six S-Bahn stations, 400 ‚Äúpark & ride‚Äù places are available all together. J√ºgesheim has at its disposal two underground parking garages in the community core, and at the community centres in Dudenhofen, Weiskirchen and Nieder-Roden, and at every sport hall are found major carparks. Even the five forest leisure facilities offer goodly parking, as does the hiking carpark in the eastern woods on the Lange Schneise (‚ÄúLong Aisle‚Äù). = Air transport = The proximity to Frankfurt Airport ‚Äì and the easy access thereto afforded by the S-Bahn ‚Äì make possible international economic links. Of course, holidaymakers also benefit from this proximity. Between Offenbach and Darmstadt, some 25 km from Rodgau, lies Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport, the busiest airport for general aviation in Germany. With its roughly 77,000 movements each year, it relieves and complements Frankfurt Airport.  Media  = Newspapers = The widely distributed daily newspapers Frankfurter Rundschau and Offenbach-Post contain in their editions for the Offenbach district a Rodgau local section. Also, on Thursdays comes the free Rodgau-Post from the Offenbach-Post‚Äôs publishing house. Also free are two further locally oriented weekly newspapers which are delivered to households, the B√ºrgerblatt and the Rodgau-Zeitung. Also, the Dreieich-Spiegel deals with Rodgau happenings peripherally. = Cable network = Many households in Rodgau can choose to have a supply of 32 television and 35 radio channels over the cable network run by Unitymedia. The signals are fed into the system at the R√∂dermark centre. Since 2005, Rodgau has also had a broadband network which can bring digital television and radio channels to every household. = DVB-T reception = Forecast DVB-T reception in Rodgau On 28 May 2006, transmission of analogue television signals to Rodgau from the Gro√üer Feldberg and W√ºrzberg Transmitters ended. Digital terrestrial broadcasting (DVB-T) took over broadcasting over the area the next day. Since then Rodgau has lain in the broadcast areas of the Gro√üer Feldberg and Frankfurt Transmitters. Reception of the broadcast television signal has been forecast throughout the town according to whether a mere indoor antenna will be enough to receive it or a simple outdoor antenna. The map at the side shows the areas in which each kind of antenna should be used.Empfangsprognose der Task Force DVB-T von ARD und ZDF = Radio = Owing to the proximity to the economic metropolis of Frankfurt, Rodgau lies within the reporting area of the following radio stations: * Hessischer Rundfunk 1-4 as well as youfm and hr- info * Hitradio FFH (Bad Vilbel) * Radio Primavera (Aschaffenburg) * Radio Fortuna (Heusenstamm) Since August 2008, the local radio station K.C.-Radio in the Rodgau constituent community of J√ºgesheim has been on the air. = Development = Given each constituent community's original village structure, their natural centres each lay around the church. This was so even after the merger into the greater community in 1977, except for Nieder-Roden. There, beginning in 1950, the fivefold swelling of the population demanded that residential building be expanded heavily towards the northwest, establishing the so-called Gartenstadt (‚ÄúGarden Town‚Äù), and that a new community core be developed, with a post office, shops, a clinic, and a community and social services centre. Here, under planning by the Baugilde S√ºd (‚ÄúBuilding Guild South‚Äù) also arose in the late 1960s several developments of compact dwellings with up to twelve floors. Most striking in today's skyline is the development known locally as the Chinamauer (‚ÄúChina Wall‚Äù), a roughly 300 m-long block of maisonette flats. The original plan called for the development to be 900 m long, but this never came about. Despite the town's neverending growth, it has no hospital. The nearest one is found in Seligenstadt. Carefully laying out new building developments since 1979 has on the one hand made possible the population growth that has led to the current levels, but on the other hand it has also led to the establishment of the needed social infrastructure such as kindergartens, schools, and sport and leisure facilities. Although the town has slowly been growing together, as yet there is no true town centre. The individual constituent communities look after their own structures as they have thus far grown. Since 1998, the Lokale Agenda 21 has been flowing as the leading stream of thought in shaping the town. A board of dedicated citizens developed a guiding image for the townsfolk whose goal is sustainability as a ‚Äúroof‚Äù for economy, environment, social services, culture, one world, and so on. The board was granted an advisory function to town council and the right to speak at council meetings, and it worked out suggestions for, among other things, renaturalization and desegregation. Since 2002, the Agenda 21 Quality Phase has been running, that is to say the actual implementation of the suggestions until 2017. The board itself was dissolved in 2003 after the end of the Growth Phase (1998‚Äì2002). = Churches = Sch√∂nstatt-Zentrum Chapel At five Evangelical and six Catholic churches and community centres, regular services are held. The Islamic community gathers at a small mosque in Nieder- Roden. Evangelical Christians number 25.5% in Rodgau, Catholics 39.0%. The other 35.5% either belong to other denominations, or adhere to no faith. On Rodgau-Weiskirchen's eastern outskirts, there has been since 1982 a conference and training centre of the Catholic International Apostolic Sch√∂nstatt Movement in the Bishopric of Mainz. = Education = Besides 25 kindergartens, there is in Rodgau ‚Äì owing in some measure to the long time during which the current constituent communities were self-administering ‚Äì a broad array of different kinds of school. There is the Gymnasium upper level at the Claus-von-Stauffenberg-Schule in Dudenhofen with grade levels 11 to 13. There are the Georg-B√ºchner-Schule in J√ºgesheim and the Geschwister-Scholl- Schule in Hainhausen, both co√∂perative comprehensive schools, and also the Heinrich-B√∂ll-Schule in Nieder-Roden, an integrated comprehensive school. There are six primary schools: the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Grundschule in Dudenhofen, the Carl-Orff-Schule in J√ºgesheim, the Gartenstadt-Schule in Nieder-Roden, the Grundschule am B√ºrgerhaus in Nieder-Roden, the M√ºnchhausen- Schule in Hainhausen and the Wilhelm-Busch-Schule in J√ºgesheim. The Georg- B√ºchner-Schule, the Heinrich-B√∂ll-Schule, the Geschwister-Scholl-Schule and a few other schools located elsewhere form a school league within whose framework an exchange of experience and the planning of common projects and classwork take place. Moreover, there is in Weiskirchen the Friedrich-von- Bodelschwingh-Schule f√ºr Praktisch Bildbare (special school for trainable pupils). The town also maintains a folk high school and promotes the Freie Musikschule Rodgau. = Sport and leisure facilities = Rodgau swimming beach, the famous ‚ÄúSt. Tropez on the Quarry Pond‚Äù Besides the bathing beach on the 32.4 ha Rodgausee with its up to 300,000 visitors yearly, there are several forest recreational facilities, barbecue pits and two miniature golf courses within town limits. Those who play sports have on hand three sport centres, five sport fields, five sport halls with several functions, four gymnasia, two fitness paths and several horseback riding facilities. Seven tennis facilities and a tennis hall are likewise among the offerings, along with a beach volleyball facility with three courts at the bathing beach and a big skating facility. Sporting life in Rodgau is in the care of 55 sport clubs in the town. Among the regular yearly highlights in municipal sport are the 50-km-Ultramarathon Rodgau run by RLT Rodgau in January, a triathlon in August, the 24-Stunden-Lauf Rodgau (24-hour walk) in September and the Drachenfest (‚ÄúDragon Festival‚Äù), likewise in September.  Culture and sightseeing  Forty-nine clubs nurture the town's cultural life with many choir and orchestra concerts, readings, theatrical productions, dance tournaments, art exhibitions and workshops. The town's cultural office yearly offers a theatre season (three subscription series) with well-known artists and the regionally noted art exhibition at the Nieder-Roden community centre. Two other community centres are found in the constituent communities of Weiskirchen and Dudenhofen. In the constituent communities of Weiskirchen J√ºgesheim and Nieder-Roden, ‚Äúhomeland clubs‚Äù take it upon themselves to run museums whose collections deal with each community's history. On Friedensstra√üe in Nieder-Roden is found the region's only DDR-Museum (‚ÄúEast Germany Museum‚Äù). This museum offers a detailed overview of what were once the consequences of a divided Germany. Four cinemas and seven public libraries round the cultural life out. Since 1979, the ‚Ç¨2,500 ‚ÄúCultural Prize of the Town of Rodgau‚Äù (Kulturpreis der Stadt Rodgau) for outstanding performance by a Rodgau artist or project has been given out every year, since 1992 alternating with the ‚ÄúCultural Promotion Prize‚Äù (Kulturf√∂rderpreis), specially for young artists. Rodgau became well known countrywide for hits by the band the Rodgau Monotones, for example St. Tropez am Baggersee (‚ÄúSt. Tropez on the Quarry Pond‚Äù, which is the nickname for the local bathing beach in the town) or Erbarme, die Hesse komme (‚ÄúHave mercy, the Hessians are coming‚Äù). The Rodgau Monotones received the Cultural Prize of the Town of Rodgau in 1983. In Rodgau, four amateur theatrical groups, whose productions are a firm part of Rodgau's cultural life, are active on a club level. The Nieder-Roden group Das Gro√üe Welttheater, having gained note among thousands of spectators both in and beyond the region for its theatre projects, won the Cultural Prize in 1996 and the Cultural Promotion Prize in 2000. = Fasching (Fastnacht) = Town Hall storm on Carnival Saturday Fasching (Fastnacht, Fassenacht) is celebrated lustily in Rodgau. Said to be the Carnival's stronghold in Rodgau is J√ºgesheim (dialectal name: Giesem). Here, before the Town hall on 11 November, the opening of the ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù takes place, and on the Saturday before Ash Wednesday the opening of the ‚ÄúTown Hall storm‚Äù, the symbolic transfer of the town's administration to the fools. On the Thursday before Ash Wednesday the Carnival parade winds its way through J√ºgesheim's streets. The Carnival representatives, the Carnival Prince and Princess and the Child Prince and Princess, have in more recent times not always come from J√ºgesheim. Other constituent communities may now enter contestants. = Sightseeing = An historic town core is something that Rodgau, given the way it came into being, simply cannot offer. A lack of awareness of the worth of old buildings led, especially in the years after the Second World War, to the wholesale destruction of many timber-frame buildings in the old communities. Only in the early 1970s were historical buildings that were still standing systematically catalogued and ranked according to criteria for monumental protection. The five former village churches from the 13th to 19th centuries even today still mark the old village cores. In the 1990s, with the church parishes‚Äô, the municipality's and many volunteers‚Äô support, they were renovated and also put back in their original states. The Gothic tower at the Matthias-Kirche (‚ÄúSaint Matthew‚Äôs Church‚Äù) in Nieder-Roden is Rodgau's oldest preserved building. Within the churches themselves are found objects of importance to art history from various epochs. Particularly worthy of mention among these is the Late Gothic Marienaltar (‚ÄúMary‚Äôs Altar‚Äù) in Nieder-Roden's Catholic Matthias- Kirche, which comes from the time about 1520, and is ascribed to the Riemenschneider school. Single timber-frame houses scattered about the municipal area from the 16th to 19th centuries have been restored and today adorn the old village cores. A few buildings, such as the bakehouse (Backes) in Dudenhofen have been built once again from old plans. The watertower in J√ºgesheim, opened in 1938 and operated until 1979 is said from its architectural uniqueness and bold static construction to be an industrial monument. It shows clear echoes of the expressionistic style of the 1920s. Three of the four railway station buildings on the former Rodgaubahn opened in 1896 are said to be worthy of preservation, but are still awaiting renovation and new uses. Another historical building is an old fire station in which is housed the Weiskirchen local history museum. Worth seeing, too, are the eleven artistically made fountains as well as many sculptures and fa√ßade paintings that characterize the town. Many dedicated citizens contribute to the further bettering of the town's appearance through donations, street festivals and hands-on work, and to the building and expansion of a civic culture. A further highlight of Rodgau is the Drachenfest (‚ÄúKite Festival‚Äù) with its firework contest, held every year in late September.

Kick start mechanisms were almost universally a part of motorcycle engines before the mid-1970s, and were phased out of production over the next twenty years or so as electric starters became standard equipment. There are still some motorcycles produced that have both kick and electric starters. Many mopeds and scooters also carry both a kick start and an electric start, the former being useful in case the latter fails, as scooter and moped batteries tend to be smaller and, as a result, run down much faster than other forms of automotive batteries. Also, it is usually not possible to push start a moped or scooter with automatic transmission. Larger motorcycles featured a manual compression release mechanism that made starting easier while modern units did this automatically through a cable attached to the kick start lever. Today, dedicated off-road motorcycles and many ATVs use kick start systems, due to the increased weight of electric starters. The majority of the inexpensive two-wheelers and sometimes three-wheelers in developing countries, also use kick start levers. Operation Before starting, kickstart levers are generally unfolded from the side of the motorcycle so that the rider can clear the side of the engine as it rotates. As the lever begins to descend under the riders foot, the rachet engages a gear linked to the crankshaft causing it to spin past top dead center so that an ignition spark can ignite the compressed fuel mixture. Upon starting, the rachet disengages and the rider folds the lever back. On some large displacement twins or singles, 'kickback' can occur if the fuel ignites before the piston reaches top dead center. This causes the crank to spin backwards and can be painful for the rider as the lever kicks back on their foot. The first kick start motorcycle was a British Scott Motorcycle two-stroke twin manufactured in 1910. Some scooters have kick starters with a tendency not to always work, if not performed correctly. Some manufacturers have also included kick starters in their models, only for a purpose of introducing apparent convenience for ignition, as opposed to offering a reliable alternative for an electric starter.

The city of Sheberghan has a population of 175,599. It has four districts and a total land area of 7,335 hectares. The total number of dwellings in SheberghƒÅn is 19,511. Location SheberghƒÅn is located along the Sari Pul River banks, about west of Mazari Sharif on the national primary ring road that connects Kabul, Puli Khumri, Mazari Sharif, SheberghƒÅn, Maymana, Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, and Maidan Shar. SheberghƒÅn airport is situated between SheberghƒÅn and Aqchah. Etymology The city's name is a corruption of its classical Persian name, Shaporg√¢n, meaning \\"[King] Shapur's town\\". Shapur was the name of two Sasanian kings, both of whom built a great number of cities. However, Shapur I was the governor of the eastern provinces of the empire, and it is more likely that he is the builder of a roadway between a few important cities. These include Nishapur and Bishapur in Iran, and Peshawar in Pakistan. Ethnography After Maymana, Sheberghan is the second most important Uzbek-dominated city in all of Afghanistan. Uzbek is the First language of a majority of its inhabitants. Large numbers of Tajiks, Hazaras, Pashtuns, and Arabs live in the city. In 1856, J. P. Ferrier wrote: \\"SheberghƒÅn is a town containing 12,000 souls. Uzbeks being in the great majority.\\" The Sheberghan \\"Arabs\\" are all Persian-speaking, even though they claim an Arab identity. There are other such Persian and Pashto-speaking \\"Arabs\\" to the east, with pockets residing in Mazar-i Sharif, Kholm, Kunduz, and Jalalabad. Their self-identification as Arabs is largely based on their tribal identity, and may in fact point to the Arab migration of the 7th and 8th centuries migration to this and other Central Asian locales in the wake of the Islamic conquests of the region.Barfield (1982), p. ? History Circular fortress of Yemshi Tepe (to scale), and tumuli of Tillya Tepe, near Sheberghan. SheberghƒÅn was once a flourishing settlement along the Silk Road. In 1978, Soviet archaeologists discovered the famed Bactrian Gold in the village of Tillia Tepe outside SheberghƒÅn. In the 13th century Marco Polo visited the city and later wrote about its honey-sweet melons. SheberghƒÅn became the capital of an independent Uzbek khanate that was allotted to Afghanistan by the 1873 Anglo-Russian border agreement. SheberghƒÅn has for millennia been the focal point of power in the northeast corner of Bactria. It still sits astride the main route between Balkh and Herat, and controls the direct route north to the Amu Darya, about 90 km away, as well as the important branch route south to Sar-e Pol. In 1856, J. P. Ferrier reported: The heavily fortified town of Yemshi-tepe, just five kilometres to the northeast of modern SheberghƒÅn, on the road to Akcha, is only about from the famous necropolis of Tillia Tepe, where an immense treasure was excavated from the graves of the local royal family by a joint Soviet-Afghan archaeological effort from 1969 to 1979. In 1977, a Soviet-Afghan archaeological team began excavations 5 km north of the town for relics. They uncovered mud-brick columns and a cross-shaped altar of an ancient temple dating back to at least 1000 B.C. Six royal tombs were excavated at Tillia Tepe revealing a vast amount of gold and other treasures. Several coins dated to the early 1st century C.E., with none dated later. SheberghƒÅn has been proposed as the site of ancient Xidun, one of the five xihou, or divisions, of the early Kushan Empire.Hill (2009), pp. 29, 332-341. SheberghƒÅn was the site of the Dasht-i- Leili massacre in December 2001 during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in which 250 to 3,000 (depending on sources) Taliban prisoners were shot or suffocated to death in metal truck containers, while being transferred by American and Northern Alliance soldiers from Kunduz to a SheberghƒÅn prison. SheberghƒÅn was the stronghold of Uzbek warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum, who had been vying with his Tajik rival General Mohammed Atta for control of northern Afghanistan. Land Use SheberghƒÅn is a trading and transit hub in northern Afghanistan. Agriculture accounts for 50% of the 7,335 hectares within the municipal boundaries. 23% of the land is residential, and largely clustered in the central area, but well distributed through the four districts. Climate SheberghƒÅn has a cool, semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk) with hot summers and chilly, though variable, winters. There is moderate rainfall and some snowfall from January to March, but the rest of the year is dry, especially the summer. Economy SheberghƒÅn is surrounded by irrigated agricultural land. With Soviet assistance, exploitation of Afghanistan's natural gas reserves began in 1967 at the Khowaja Gogerak field, 15 kilometers east of SheberghƒÅn in Jowzjan Province. The field's reserves were thought to be 67 billion cubic meters. In 1967, the Soviets also completed a 100-kilometer gas pipeline linking Keleft in the Soviet Union with SheberghƒÅn. To demonstrate how natural gas reserves could be used as an alternative to expensive petroleum imports, the United States Department of Defense spent $43 million on a natural gas filling station. SheberghƒÅn is important to the energy infrastructure of Afghanistan: * The Zomrad Sai Oilfield is situated near SheberghƒÅn. * The SheberghƒÅn Topping Plant processes crude oil for consumption in heating boilers in Kabul, Mazari Sharif, and SheberghƒÅn. * The Jorqaduk, Khowaja Gogerak, and Yatimtaq gas fields are all located within of SheberghƒÅn.

They seem to be similar in purpose and character to Trajan's Wall situated to the southwest in Bessarabia. The remaining ancient walls have a total length of 1,000 km and constitute less than 20% of the original wall system. According to a legend, the earthworks are results of ancient events when a mythical hero (bohatyr) Kozmodemian (or Borysohlib) in order to slay gargantuan Dragon (Serpent) harnessed it in a giant plow and furrowed. The Dragon (Serpent) bit the dust and from plowing there were left furrows on both sides of which towered immense chunks of earth that among people were named as Serpent's Wall. The ancient walls were built between the 2nd century BC and 7th century AD, according to carbon dating. There are three theories as to what peoples built the walls: either the Sarmatians against the Scythians, or the Goths of Oium against the Huns, or the Early East Slavs against the nomads of the southern steppes. In Slavic culture, the warlike nomads are often associated with the winged dragon, hence the name. On the right bank of Dnieper between its tributaries Teteriv and Ros the remnants of wall create six lines elongated from west to east. One Serpent's Wall was passed over the left bank of Dnieper and its tributary Sula. The 1974-85 explorations has established that Serpent's Wall is a remnant of wooded earth fortifications built at the end of 10th and the first half of 11th centuries, smaller part in the 12th century, to protect middle Dnieper Ukraine and Kyiv from pechenegs and cumans.

History Beefeater was formed by Tomas Squip, Fred \\"Freak\\" Smith, Dug E. Bird (Birdzell) and Bruce Atchley Taylor. Their debut LP, Plays for Lovers, was released in 1985 on Dischord Records, their follow-up was the six-song 1986 Need a Job EP, whereas their second record on Dischord, House Burning Down, was posthumously released in 1987 as their farewell album. Both band's Dischord releases would be combined on the 1992 compilation CD Plays For Lovers & House Burning Down, with two bonus tracks. For Beefeater's second record, drummer Bruce Taylor was replaced by Mark \\"Two- Chair\\" Shellhaas, who in turn, would be substituted by Kenny Craun for the band's final album. After the breakup of Beefeater, Squip and Birdzell went on to form Fidelity Jones, while Craun joined the Rhythm Pigs, and Fred \\"Freak\\" Smith joined Strange Boutique. While Beefeater's songs had all the angry energy of its hardcore labelmates the energy was channelled as much through funk and jazz as rock and roll. Dug E. Bird's fast-paced bass slap drives a rhythm section over which Fred \\"Not Sonic\\" Smith's guitar rides in a way reminiscent of the Minutemen. House Burning Down saw the incorporation of even more non-punk influences, most notably world music and included musical cameos many of the Dischord Records regulars (Ian MacKaye provides an intro to the album, in addition to some saxophone).

Inspired by the memoir of the same title by gay historian Martin Duberman, Stonewall is a fictionalized account of the weeks leading up to the Stonewall riots, a seminal event in the modern American gay rights movement. The film stars Guillermo D√≠az, Frederick Weller, Brendan Corbalis, and Duane Boutte. While the film is a work of fiction, Finch makes the unusual directorial choice of including documentary-style interview footage with several people who were at the Stonewall Inn during the uprising. Finch also intersperses lip synch numbers performed by the actors throughout the film to function as something of a Greek chorus. Plot Matty Dean, a young gay man, arrives in New York City and heads for Greenwich Village. He falls in with crossdressing sex worker La Miranda and friends, who take him to Stonewall Inn. There is a police raid and Matty and La Miranda are arrested. They are bailed out by Bostonia, the African-American \\"mother\\" of the queens who hang out at Stonewall, and the secret lover of Vinnie, the deeply closeted mafioso who runs Stonewall. Matty and La Miranda go back to her place where she receives her draft notice. Matty attends a meeting of the Mattachine Society, where he meets Burt and Ethan. The group is planning a picket at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. Ethan and Matty witness an initiation of sorts as a young man named Jos√© becomes the persona Camelia. After the ceremony they return to La Miranda's place and have sex. Matty spends time with Ethan, who is a writer under a pseudonym for a homophile magazine. La Miranda reports to the induction center in full drag and is ordered to go for psychological evaluation. La Miranda is terrified because of former bad experiences with psychiatrists, so Matty dons her clothes and meets with the doctor in her place, securing a rejection from military service for her as a \\"sexual deviant.\\" On the subway ride home, Matty tells La Miranda he loves her. At a Mattachine meeting, Matty is disgusted by the guest speaker, a psychiatrist who discourses on the then-current disease model of homosexuality, and leaves. After the meeting Burt, Ethan and Matty argue about it on their way to meet with a reporter and photographer from the Village Voice newspaper. The group stages a \\"sip-in,\\" trying to illustrate discriminatory alcohol service laws by being refused service but no one refuses to serve them until they go to Stonewall. At the bar La Miranda and Ethan meet and Ethan treats her mockingly. La Miranda realizes that Matty hasn't told his Mattachine friends about her and storms out. Matty follows and they argue about La Miranda's refusal to conform and Matty's feeling the need to be with more masculine men. Matty seeks out Ethan and they begin an affair. Vinnie points out a clinic he calls the \\"Palace of Dreams\\" and tells Bostonia that he wants her to have sex reassignment surgery so that they can marry, but she is opposed to the idea. Following the Philadelphia picket, Ethan takes Matty to Fire Island. Given the choice between Ethan's acceptance of discrimination and La Miranda's defiance, Matty chooses La Miranda and they reconcile. It is the day of Judy Garland's death. Bostonia watches the television coverage. To cheer her up, Vinnie takes her out in full drag in public for the first time. They have ice cream at a fancy restaurant, their open affection drawing disapproving stares and are asked to leave by the manager. As they wake up together the next morning, Vinnie asks Bostonia if he's ever told her that he loves her. She says no. Vinnie suddenly commits suicide with a bullet through the head and Bostonia becomes hysterical. Vinnie has left her a large amount of cash and scrawled \\"I LOVE YOU\\" on a mirror in lipstick. That night at Stonewall there's another raid. Several of the queens are arrested, including Bostonia. She smashes a police officer in the face and is attacked by other cops. When other queens fight back, touching off the riots that would mark the beginning of the gay community's militant advocacy movement for its rights.

He was considered as one of the pupils of Akhund Khorasani and besides he was admired by Ayatollah Mara'shi Najafi. =Education= At the age of 5, Morteza Motahhari went to school without informing his parents. By the age of twelve he learned the preliminary Islamic sciences from his father. He also went to the seminary of Mashhad and studied for two years there in the school of Abd ul-Khan along with his brother. But his studies remained unfinished in Mashhad seminary because of problems faced by his family which obliged him to return to Fariman to help them. According to Motahhari's own account, in this period he could study a great number of historical books. It was in this period that he was confronted with questions on worldview such as the problem of God. He considered Agha Mirza Mahdi Shahid Razavi as an eminent master in rational sciences. He decided to go to Qom in 1315 (Solar Hijri calendar). He finally took up residence in the school of Feyzieh in Qom. He studied the books Kifayah and Makaseb in Shia jurisprudence under the instruction of Ayatollah Sayyed Mohaqeq Yazdi popularly known as Damad. He also participated in the lectures of Hojjat Kooh Kamarehei and sought knowledge from Sadr al-Din al- Sadr, Mohammad Taqi Khansari, Golpaygani, Ahmad Khansari and Najafi Marashi. When Ayatollah Boroujerdi emigrated to Qom, Motahari could take part in his courses on Principles of Jurisprudence. Ayatollah Montazeri was his classmate in this period. Later, Motahhari emigrated to Isfahan because of hot climate of Qom. There he became familiar with Haj Ali Agha Shirazi who was the teacher of Nahj al-Balagha in 1320 (Solar Hijri calendar) whom Motahhari always described with honor. Later, he joined the University of Tehran, where he taught philosophy for 22 years. Between 1965 and 1973 he also gave regular lectures at the Hosseiniye Ershad in Northern Tehran. Motahhari wrote several books on Islam, Iran, and historical topics. His emphasis was on teaching rather than writing. However, after his death, some of his students worked on writing down his lectures and publishing them as books. As of the mid-2008, the \\"Sadra Publication\\" published more than sixty volumes by Motahhari. Nearly 30 books were written about Motahhari or quoted from his speeches. Morteza Motahhari opposed what he called groups who \\"depend on other schools, especially materialistic schools\\" but who present these \\"foreign ideas with Islamic emblems\\". In a June 1977 article he wrote to warn \\"all great Islamic authorities\\" of the danger of \\"these external influential ideas under the pretext and banner of Islam.\\" It is thought he was referring to the People's Mujahideen of Iran and the Furqan Group. Motahhari was the father-in-law of Iran's former secretary of National Security Council Ali Larijani. It was by Motahari's advice that Larijani switched from computer science to Western Philosophy for graduate studies. A major street in Tehran formerly known as Takhte Tavoos (Peacock Throne) was renamed after him. Morteza Motahari Street connects Sohrevardi Street and Valiasr Street, two major streets in Tehran. Activities during the Islamic revolution During the struggle with Shah's regime, Morteza Motahhari contributed in creating new Islamic discourses. Besides, he was among those who had discussed the conditions of Marja' after the death of Ayatollah Broujerdi. He wrote the book Mutual services of Iran and Islam in such a condition. Also his works had an important impact on expanding the movement of religious reform in early days of revolution. His works primarily consisted of traditional Islamic and Shia thoughts. He wrote an essay about revitalization of religious thought in the occasion. Writing the \\"need for Candidness in religious leadership\\", he aimed to show the youth the attractiveness of Islam. Opinions Morteza Motahhari expressed his opinions in different majors and disciplines such as philosophy, religion, economic, politics, etc. Motahhari and Shariati were counted as two prominent figures during Islamic revolution of Iran. He emphasized on Islamic democracy for suitable political structure. Motahhari also recognized fitra as the truth of human. According to him, fitra is a permanent and unchangeable quality in human nature. In fact, he believed that fitra played the role of a mediator in God-human beings relation. Also, he believed that Imam was a perfect man who shows the high rank of human spirituality. Imam also is characterized as a religious leader. His lengthy footnote on the ‚Äúbook of principles of philosophy and method of realism‚Äù by Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i was against the historical Marxism. Also he believed that Wali-e faqih only had the right of supervisory not governing. He also maintained that the ruling was one of the political aspect of Imam in society. He maintained that there was no conflict between science and religion since he believed that Science qua science had no conflict and challenge with metaphysics. He believed that the quasi-conflict between science and religion was in terms of their language not themselves.The relation of science and religion according to Motahhari, Muhammad hossein mahdavi nejad, magazine of legal investigation, number:6-7, 1381 solar, in Persian =Development= Motahhari also expressed views on development and relevant ideology. According to him, freedom, culture and mental-cultural revolution are principles of development. He also refers to some elements for characterizing a developed society. These factors are independence, knowledge and transcendence. Also, according to Motahhari, development originates from cultural self-reliance, purification of cultural sources and logical and cautious communication with west. Motahhari believed in the development of human resources but he also thought that economy was not an aim but only is a condition for development. =Equality= As outlined by Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari in 1975, the phrase ‚Äòequal rights‚Äô means something different from what is commonly understood by western world. He clarified that men and women were innately different and therefore enjoyed different rights, duties and punishments. =Fiqh= Motahhari believed that the eternality of Islam is provided by Fiqh. He thought that fiqh along with the character of ijtihad could be an important thing for confronting with the problem of different times and places. Using ijtihad, there is no need to a new prophet. =Freedom = Motahhari defined freedom as nonexistence of obstacles. According to him, obstacles were of two characters. The first one was that obstacle could limit human and besides counted as a something get human not to do something. In simple word, obstacle could has the dignity of limiting and declining humans. The second one is to thing which decline the perception and introspection of subject in terms of knowledge. According to Motahhari, aside from the realization of putting away obstacles we need to give the spirit of freedom. He analyze the concept of freedom as both right and obligation. He believes that the freedom has necessity for human. Human must be free to choose voluntarily his path. He believes that, contrary to liberalists, inborn right has an ultimate for transcending of human beings.Life's outcome, A survey of Morteza Motahhari's Ideas. p.455-475. vol.1, 1386 solar, Abdullah Nasri =Philosophy of law= Like other men of thought, Motahhari thinks that we have to define the concepts first of all. Therefore, he defines right as a dominance or score on something. According to right the human is merit to possess something and other human ought to respect him. Some of rights are such as the right of parents on their children or the rights of husband and wife in relation to each other. Motahhari divided the right into two groups. First group is existential rights or takwini and the second is religious rights or tashriei. former is a real relation between person and object and the latter determined according to former. He knew the right as a potential score for persons. In fact the right concerned with the priority of somebody on something. He concerned with the question in that is the right and possession predicated on human as such or predicated on human in terms of being in society? He believes that undoubtedly the right existed prior to society. Contrary to John Austin (legal philosopher), Motahhari believes that there is a mutual relation between right and responsibility (Haq va Taklif). Motahhari believes that the natural law theory is a rational one that is of importance for human kind. According to him, the foundation of natural theory of law is to world has a goal and aim finally. On the basis of principle of having goal, the God creates the world for the sake of human kind and they have potential right to change the world therefore human kind have right prior to introducing in society.life's outcome, A survey of Motahhari's Ideas.p.401-410.vol.1,1386 solar =Philosophy of religion= Motahhari refers to the concept of 'maktab' or school when he intends to define the word of religion. According to him maktab is a thoughtful disciplined system including ideology and View in terms of ethics, politics, economy and civil law, etc. Finally, he defines religion as a collection of knowledge bestowed to human for the sake of guiding him and also religion is a collection of beliefs, moralities and individual and collective judgments. Therefore, he knows religion and its teaching as beliefs, moralities and judgments. Also Motahhari believes that the domain of religion at all is not limited to life but concerned with after afterlife. He believes that Islam as a religion is consistent with life of human and there is no room for denying it.Ryaz Ahmaddar,religion and political and social system from Motahari and Iqbal Lahouri, Tolou Magazine, 2007, 21, 6. =Western philosophy= Dariush Shayegan believes that Motahhari confused the Hegelian thought and Stace's quotations in confronting with Hegel. According to Shaygan since each of Motahhari and Hegel belong to different paradigms, there is no common world between them. Epistemology He considered Marxism as a great threat for youths and revolution of Iran therefore he tried to criticize Marxism along with pioneer figures like Ali Shariati. Also his commentary on the book of Mulla Sadra influenced many scholars. Besides, he also emphasized on the social, cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge. Motahhari argued that if someone compares fatwas belong to different jurists and at the same time considers their lives and states of knowledge then it is clear that the presuppositions of jurists and its knowledge affected their knowledge. According to him, because of this reason, we observe that the fatwa belong to Arab has an Arab flavor and the fatwa belong to non-Arab has an Ajam flavor. Also He tried to compare Quran with nature. He also believed that the contemporary interpretations of Quran were considerable than Ancient rendition of Islam because the future generation has a better understanding of Quran and Also a deeper appreciation of it. But At the same Time he doesn‚Äôt believe in epistemological pluralism.Behrooz Ghamari-Tabrizi, Abdolkarim Soroush,The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics, Edited by John L.

During his 9 years of residence in this house (from 1346 to 1355), which had the longest time compared to the rest of his years of residence in Tehran, he wrote most of his works in this house. The house is built on two floors, on the first floor of which are the manuscripts and personal belongings of Shahid Motahari and on the second floor are the books of that martyr. The Shahid Motahari Museum was established in 2007. Identifying, collecting, organizing, introducing and preserving the works of the master is one of the main goals of becoming a museum of this historical house. Providing a suitable space and environment for researchers who intend to study the works of Master Motahhari has also been one of the reasons for reading the second floor of this house.

NOCS was created in 1995 jointly between the University of Southampton and the UK Natural Environment Research Council and is located within the port of Southampton at a purpose-built dockside campus with modern facilities. In 2010 the University and NERC components demerged, and the NERC-managed component became the National Oceanography Centre (NOC ‚Äì with the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in Liverpool). The two components of NOCS continue close collaboration through the jointly run Graduate School, shared research facilities and laboratories, complementary research groups, and many joint research grants and publications. The University component ‚ÄúOcean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton‚Äù (OES) is part of the Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, (FNES). It was ranked 30th in the world for Earth and Marine Sciences by the QS World University Rankings in 2014. In November 2019, NOC became formally independent from the NERC and now operates as a company limited by guarantee with charitable status. History The centre can trace its origins back to the years immediately after Second World War, when the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) was founded. The plan to create National Oceanography Centre Southampton as a centre of excellence in marine and earth science was formulated in the late 1980s to early 1990s by the Natural Environment Research Council in coordination with the University of Southampton. According to that plan a research and teaching complex was erected on the new Waterfront Campus dock-side location within the Port of Southampton to become the new home for the former National Institute of Oceanographic Science (from Wormley, Surrey), the Research Vessel Service (from Barry, Wales) and the former University of Southampton departments of Geology and Oceanography. NOCS was officially opened in 1996 as the Southampton Oceanography Centre by Prince Philip (he also renamed it the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, in 2005). The Centre's inaugural director from 1994-99 was John Shepherd, a former Deputy Director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and an Earth system scientist.

Amleto Vespa's Chinese Affair (1884-1944), translation of Amleto Vespa spia in Cina (1884-1944) , 2014Mattia Fonzi, I misteri sull'incredibile storia di Amleto Vespa: agente segreto aquilano, NewsTown, 15 February 2015 (in Italian) was an Italian mercenary and secret agent of Italian origin, who worked in Manchuria from 1922 to 1940, first for a local warlord, and then for the Empire of Japan. A self-proclaimed fascist and an admirer of Benito Mussolini, Vespa had no admiration for the Japanese administration of Manchukuo, which he described with considerable venom in a book published in 1938. Biography Vespa was born in the town of L'Aquila, Abruzzo, as the youngest of five children of Alessandro Vespa, a civil servant and Ginevra Concetta de Chellis, a teacher. Little is known of his early life, aside from what he subsequently wrote in his autobiography, in which he claims to have been born in 1888 to a poor farmer's family, left the Italian countryside in 1910 to fight in the Mexican Revolution against Emiliano Zapata, had been involved in various political intrigues in Eastern Europe and to have married a Polish Countess. He also claimed to have traveled extensively in the United States, Australia, French Indochina and in Mongolia. His Italian military service record however shows that he was born in L'Aquila in 1884 and there are no traces in the Mexican archives of an Italian in the front line alongside Madero. Letters to his brother indicate that he left Italy in 1908 for San Francisco and in 1911 traveled to Vladivostok, where he joined the Allied Expeditionary Forces intelligence services. He met his wife Jeannine (Nina for short) in Vladivostok, where she and her mother, as Russian aristocrats, had fled after the 1917 revolution. Vespa and his wife moved across the Chinese border to Harbin in 1920, and worked for Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin until Zhang's assassination in 1928. The Italian consulate in Tianjin had arrest and deportation orders issued for Vespa, who was accused of smuggling weapons and dealing in drugs on behalf of Zhang. To avoid arrest and deportation, he managed to obtain Chinese citizenship in 1924. After the Manchurian Incident of 1931, Vespa fled Harbin just ahead of the Kempeitai secret police. His family was captured and eventually freed after Vespa agreed to work for the new Japanese rulers of Manchuria under the name \\"Commander Feng\\". Secret Agent of Japan Through an Australian reporter, Vespa published an account of his life in Manchukuo in a sensationalist book intended for mass audiences in 1938: Secret Agent of Japan: A Handbook to Japanese Imperialism. According to Vespa, he began to meet with the chief of the Japanese secret service in Manchukuo, a \\"Japanese Prince\\" whose name was unknown to him. According to conversations with his Japanese superiors, Vespa reports that the Japanese wanted the colony of Manchukuo to be financially self-supporting. Vespa was instructed to compile reports on wealthy members of Harbin's Jewish community, White Russian and other foreign and Chinese residents. He was also instructed to recruit bandit forces to sabotage the China Far East Railway, which was run by the Soviet government. Vespa claimed that the Japanese sold monopolies in gambling, prostitution and opium to racketeers to help pay for the conquest of China. In Harbin alone, Vespa counted 172 brothels, 56 opium dens and 194 stores selling narcotics. However, the situation was confused because there were five distinct Japanese security organizations in Manchuria, often at odds with each other, and individual officers sometimes kept for themselves money that was intended to pay for Japanese arms. Vespa sold protection to other racketeers and organized gang raids against rivals of the monopolies. Vespa mentions that the areas under opium poppy cultivation increased rapidly after 1932, and that from 1937, opium was sent to China, under the guise of military materiels for the Imperial Japanese Army. In localities with no Japanese military detachments, shipments were sent to Japanese consulates. Imperial Japanese Navy vessels transported drugs to towns and cities along China's coastlines and Japanese patrol boats did the same on China's principal rivers. Vespa supposed that these shipments were meant to demoralize enemy troops and reduce their combat effectiveness. Vespa also reported that many monopolies were awarded to ethnic Koreans. These monopolies included chimney sweeping and supplying Manchukuo flags, which were attempts to extort money from the local population. =The Kaspe Affair= Vespa's book also gives details of the Simon Kasp√© kidnapping case. Joseph Kaspe was a prominent Jewish businessman who owned the \\"Moderne Hotel\\", the principal hotel in Harbin. His son Simon, a French citizen and a pianist from Paris, was kidnapped while visiting Harbin on 23 August 1933. Those directly responsible were said to be a White Russian gang. When foreign diplomatic pressure obliged the Japanese authorities to arrest the kidnappers, the gang executed Simeon Kaspe. Vespa relates the discovery of the mutilated corpse of Simeon Kaspe in November 1933 outside Harbin. Vespa recorded a number of other similar cases. =The Lytton Commission= Vespa also reported that Japanese secret agents were instructed to prevent complaints and petitions filed by the local population from reaching the members of the Lytton Commission during their visit. However, despite all these efforts, the Commission nevertheless was able to interview many individuals secretly, and it received many more written submissions which protested against the Japanese authorities. =Last years and death= His double agency discovered, Vespa managed to take refuge in Shanghai in 1936. His book was published in London in 1938 and had sold very well. He took a trip as a Chinese citizen between Hong Kong and New York in April 1939 under the name Dechellis Vespa and calling himself a journalist. In 1940, he was imprisoned in Shanghai by the Kenpeitai, on accusations of being a spy for the United States, but as an Italian and thus also a citizen of a Japanese ally, he could not be sentenced. Contact with his family ceased after the Pearl Harbor attacks in December 1941. Amleto and Nina had two children, Italo and Ginevra/Genevieve. After Vespa's disappearance, they moved to the United States. Genevieve joined the League of Nations as an interpreter, while his son became an aeronautical engineer, completely changing his identity. After the war, Genevieve visited the Italian Embassy in Shanghai and was shown documents informing that her father had been taken prisoner by the Japanese, who took him to Taiwan and executed him there or perhaps in the Philippines. However, together with most of the archive, those documents were destroyed in a mysterious fire inside the embassy shortly after.

As pioneers of the four-member instrumental format, the band consisted of lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums. Their range covers pop, rock, surf rock and ballads with a jazz influence. The core members from 1958 to 2015 were Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch. Along with the Fender guitar, another cornerstone of the Shadows sound was the Vox amplifier. The Shadows, with Cliff Richard, dominated British popular music in the late 1950s and early 1960s in the years before the Beatles. The Shadows' number one hits included \\"Apache\\", \\"Kon-Tiki\\", \\"Wonderful Land\\", \\"Foot Tapper\\" and \\"Dance On!\\". Although these and most of their best-remembered hits were instrumentals, the group also recorded occasional vocal numbers, and hit the UK top ten with the group-sung \\"Don't Make My Baby Blue\\" in 1965. Two other vocal songs by the Shadows also made the charts. They disbanded in 1968, but reunited in the 1970s for further commercial success. The Shadows are the fifth most successful act in the UK singles chart, behind Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Cliff Richard and Madonna The Shadows and Cliff Richard & the Shadows each have had four No. 1 selling EPs. Career Hank Marvin, lead guitarist of the Shadows The Shadows formed as a backing band for Cliff Richard under the name The Drifters, the original members were founder Ken Pavey (born 1932), Terry Smart on drums (1942), Norman Mitham on guitar (1941), Ian Samwell on guitar and Harry Webb (before he became Cliff Richard) on guitar and vocals. They had no bass player. Samwell wrote their debut single, \\"Move It\\", often mistakenly attributed to \\"Cliff Richard and the Shadows\\" and not the Drifters . Initially their producer and manager Norrie Paramor wanted to record using only studio musicians but after persuasion he allowed Smart and Samwell to play as well. Two session players, guitarist Ernie Shear and bassist Frank Clark, played on the \\"Move It/Schoolboy Crush\\" single on Paramor's insistence to ensure a strong sound.\\"Cliff Richard ‚Äì 29 August 1958\\" in Crampton, L., Lazell, B., Rees, D in: \\"Guinness Book of Rock Stars\\" Guinness Publ. Co. Middlesex 1989 In his memoirs, Welch regrets that he and Marvin could not be at the start of making history with \\"Move It\\".Bruce Welch: Rock and Roll, I Gave You the Best Years of My Life, Penguin Books, London, 1989, p.78. The Drifters signed for Jack Good's Oh Boy! television series. Paramor of EMI signed Richard, and asked Johnny Foster to recruit a better guitarist. Foster went to Soho's 2i's coffee bar, known for musical talent performing there, particularly in skiffle, in search of guitarist Tony Sheridan. Sheridan was not there but Foster's attention was caught by Hank Marvin, who played guitar well and wore Buddy Holly-style glasses. Bruce Welch, rhythm guitarist of the Shadows In spring the same year, the owner of the United States vocal group The Drifters threatened legal action over naming rights after the release and immediate withdrawal of \\"Feelin Fine\\" in the US. The second single, Jet Black, was released in the States under the name of The Four Jets to avoid further legal aggravation, but a new band name was urgently needed. The name \\"The Shadows\\" was thought up by guitarist Jet Harris (unaware of Bobby Vee's backing group) while he and Marvin were at the Six Bells pub in Ruislip in July 1959. From The Story of the Shadows: > With a combination of the American situation, Cliff Richard's first number 1 > hit, the runaway success \\"Living Doll\\" had by now sold over a million copies > in Britain alone and after a bit of nudging from Norrie Paramor, they set > about finding a permanent name, which arrived out of the blue one summer's > day in July 1959 (maybe the 19th). When Hank Marvin and Jet Harris took off > on their scooters up to the Six Bells pub at Ruislip, Jet hit upon a name > straight away. 'What about the Shadows?' The lad was a genius! So we became > the Shadows for the first time on Cliff's sixth single \\"Travellin' Light\\". =1960s= Cliff Richard and the Shadows in 1962 The Shadows where also becoming popular band in their own right and in 1960, \\"Apache\\", an instrumental by Jerry Lordan, topped the UK charts for five weeks. Further hits followed, including the number ones \\"Kon Tiki\\" and \\"Wonderful Land\\", another Lordan composition with orchestral backing. The Shadows played on further hits as Richard's band. In October 1961, drummer Tony Meehan left to be a music producer at Decca records. He was replaced by Brian Bennett. In April 1962, Jet Harris was replaced by Brian \\"Licorice\\" Locking. Bennett and Locking were friends from the 2I's who had been in Marty Wilde's backing group, the Wildcats, who recorded instrumentals as the Krew Kats. This Shadows line-up released seven hit singles, two of which, \\"Dance On!\\" and \\"Foot Tapper\\", topped the charts. In October 1963, Locking left to spend more time as a Jehovah's Witness. Meanwhile, Harris and Meehan teamed up at Decca as an eponymous duo to record another Lordan instrumental, \\"Diamonds\\". It rose to UK no. 1 in January 1963. Two further hits, \\"Scarlett O'Hara\\" (also by Lordan) and \\"Applejack\\", followed in the same year. On the Lordan tunes, Harris played lead using a six-stringed Fender Bass VI. During 1963, ironically the ex- Shadows were competing in the charts with their former bandmates. The Shadows had met John Rostill on tour with other bands and had been impressed by his playing, so they invited him to join. This final and longest-lasting line-up was the most innovative as they tried different guitars and developed a wider range of styles and higher musicianship. They produced albums but the chart positions of singles began to ease. The line-up had ten hits, the first and most successful of which was \\"The Rise and Fall of Flingel Bunt\\". =Films with Cliff Richard= During the 1960s, the group appeared with Cliff Richard in the films The Young Ones, Summer Holiday, Wonderful Life, and Finders Keepers. They also appeared as marionettes in the Gerry Anderson film Thunderbirds Are GO, and starred in a short B-film called Rhythm 'n Greens which became the basis of a music book and an EP. =Stage Pantomimes= They appeared in pantomime: Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp in 1964 at the London Palladium with Arthur Askey as Widow Twankey, Richard as Aladdin, and the Shadows as Wishee, Washee, Noshee and Poshee; Cinderella at the Palladium in 1966 featured Richard as Buttons and the Shadows as the Broker's Men. Their film and stage roles allowed the group to develop as songwriters. They wrote only a few songs for the earliest film, 1961's The Young Ones, but by Finders Keepers in 1966 almost the entire soundtrack was credited to Marvin-Welch- Bennett-Rostill. In 1967, the Shadows used Olivia Newton-John on the track \\"The Day I Met Marie\\" on their album From Hank Bruce Brian and John. In October 1968, Marvin and Welch decided to disband the group following a concert at the London Palladium. In the event, only Welch left, but the Shadows had disbanded by the end of the year. =1970s= The group began 1970 by appearing on the BBC's review of the '60s music scene, Pop Go The Sixties, performing \\"Apache\\" and backing Richard on \\"Bachelor Boy\\", broadcast across Europe and BBC1, on 31 December 1969. This was followed by Marvin and a reconstituted Shadows becoming resident guests on Richard's debut TV series for the BBC, It's Cliff Richard! The group were chosen by BBC Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton to perform the Song for Europe in the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest. The Shadows recorded six songs, seen each week on a weekly television show It's Lulu, on BBC1 and hosted by Lulu, a former Eurovision winner. The group taped all six performances in the TV studio before the series itself began, with the video cut into the weekly show. For the presentation of the songs on week seven and the announcement of the result on week eight, the pre-recorded performances were run again. Two of the songs (\\"No, No Nina\\" and \\"This House Runs on Sunshine\\") were co-written by members of the group. The public voted for \\"Let Me Be the One\\", composed by Paul Curtis, to go to the Eurovision final in Stockholm, Sweden in 1975. There, the group came second to the Dutch entry, Teach-In's \\"Ding-A-Dong\\". Having long stepped out of Richard's shadow, this was a rare excursion into vocals for a band known for instrumentals (although they had cut vocal tracks on most albums, plus some singles 'B' sides, and had four charting vocal singles in the '60s). Welch sang lead and let the world know when, forgetting a couple of words, he turned to colleagues and said \\"I knew it\\" in range of his microphone. Author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor notes in The Eurovision Song Contest ‚Äì The Official History that they were not a popular choice to represent the UK and the viewers' postal vote was the lowest in 'Song For Europe' history.O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest ‚Äì The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. EMI however released a compilation album in 1976, spanning 1962 to 1970: Rarities with sleeve notes by John Friesen. The first half of the album was from Marvin's solo career and the second was by the Shadows . Following the rare vocal single \\"It'll Be Me, Babe\\", written and sung by Marvin & Farrar, John Farrar amicably left the band that year, moving to the US to become the music producer for Olivia Newton- John. Among her hits, Farrar wrote \\"You're the One That I Want\\" from the film Grease which was covered by the Shadows in 1979. The packaging of hits in Twenty Golden Greats by EMI in 1977, which led to a number one album prompted the group to re-form once more for a 'Twenty Golden Dates' tour around the UK, featuring Francis Monkman (soon to be in Sky) on keyboards and Alan Jones on bass guitar. Francis left after that tour and the line-up settled as Marvin, Welch and Bennett, supplemented on records and gigs by Cliff Hall (keyboards) and Alan Jones (bass). It was this line-up that reunited with Cliff Richard for two concerts at the London Palladium in March 1978. Highlights of the concert, including four solo Shadows tracks, were released the following year on the top ten charting album Thank You Very Much. On the back of this The Shadows recorded an instrumental version of \\"Don't cry for me Argentina\\" from the west end production \\"Evita\\", released as a single at the tail end of 1978. The record eventually reached number 5 in the singles chart thereby giving the group their first top ten single since the 1960s. In 1979, their version of \\"Cavatina\\" also became a top ten hit, and they recorded ten more tracks with bassist Jones and keyboardists Dave Lawson and Alan Hawkshaw for the album String of Hits on EMI which topped the British album charts. The success of this led to EMI issuing a follow-up album with 13 old tracks (including a Marvin solo track) and one unreleased track from the 'String of Hits' sessions. These tracks came from albums released earlier in the group's career of cover versions of hit singles; this was eventually released as Another String of Hot Hits in 1980. = 1980s = After 20 successful years together the Shadows parted ways with their record company EMI and the group signed a 10-year contract to Polydor Records. The first album released under the Polydor banner was the aptly titled \\"Change of Address\\" in September 1980. With the influential arrival of keyboardist Cliff Hall, the musical style shifted from the traditional sound, becoming more electronic-based with prominent keyboards and synthesizers burying Welch's contributions. For the group's 25th anniversary in 1983, the Shadows released a double album on the Tellydisc label entitled \\"Shadows silver Album\\" which contained previously released recent material along with new recently recorded tracks. In July 1984 the Shadows reunited with Cliff Richard for a series of celebratory concerts at Wembley Arena and Birmingham NEC. In 1986, the Shadows had a top ten hit on the LP chart with 'Moonlight Shadows' a cover album in the same vein as early Polydor releases with singles \\"Moonlight Shadow\\" and Bruce Springsteen's, \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" both failing to make a dent in the singles chart. Due to Alan Jones involvement with the Dave Clark's musical Time, the bassist was not available to contribute to the album and Paul Westwood temporarily sat in. Moonlight Shadows was released on LP and CD simultaneously as the group's third CD release. This top ten album consisted entirely of cover songs. The album spent 16 weeks on chart peaking at number 6. In June 1989 the Shadows once more reunited with Cliff to celebrate 30 years in show business where the singer filled London's Wembley Stadium for two nights with a spectacular titled \\"The Event\\" in front of a combined audience of 144,000 people. As a special surprise for the fans Cliff invited onto the stage original and founding members of the group Jet Harris and Tony Meehan to perform \\"Move It\\" with him and his band. On 30 June 1990, Cliff and the Shadows performed to an estimated 120,000 people at Knebworth Park as part of an all-star concert line-up that also included Paul McCartney, Phil Collins, Elton John and Tears for Fears. The concert in aid of charity was televised around the world and helped to raise $10.5 million for disabled children and young musicians. Brian Bennett resigned from the group just before the group were to embark on what would be their final tour for 14 years with Marvin, Welch and Bennett going their separate ways on 1 December following the final concert in Southampton. The last studio album the Shadows recorded before they split, Reflection, was released in September. =Later career= The Shadows Live at Abbey Road In December 2004, each of the then-current members of the Shadows was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), but Marvin declined. The group re-formed in 2004 for a farewell tour, and recorded \\"Life Story\\" (written by Lordan) to accompany a hits package of the same name which featured 1980s re-recordings of all their 1960s and 1970s hits. This opportunity to see Marvin, Welch and Bennett, joined on keyboards by Cliff Hall and on bass by Mark Griffiths, was successful enough that they extended the tour to continental Europe in 2005. The line-up was almost the same, except that Warren Bennett, son of Brian, came in on keyboards instead of Hall. The Shadows in Brussels (2009) Marvin, Welch and Bennett appeared together as special guests at Marty Wilde's 50th anniversary concert at the London Palladium on 27 May 2007, performing \\"Move It\\" with Wilde on vocals. The concert also featured former Shadows Jet Harris and Brian Locking. On 11 December 2008, Richard and the Shadows performed at the Royal Variety Performance, at the same time announcing their forthcoming 50th anniversary tour. The tour began in September 2009 with 36 shows throughout the UK and continental Europe, extending in 2010 to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. A new album, Reunited, featuring mostly rerecorded versions of their own hits, reached number four in the UK Albums Chart in 2009. \\"Singing the Blues\\", the first \\"Cliff Richard and the Shadows\\" single for 40 years, reached number 40 in the UK Singles Chart, and is Richard's most recent top 40 hit. The Final Tour was put on Blu-ray format by Eagle Records in 2010. Welch, Bennett, Mark Griffiths and Warren Bennett performed two Shadows hits (\\"Apache\\" and \\"Wonderful Land\\") at Albert Lee's 70th birthday concerts at Cadogan Hall, London, on 1 and 2 March 2014, Lee playing with them on lead guitar. The Shadows recorded an interpretation of John Barry's \\"The Appointment\\" for the 2015 Brian Bennett album Shadowing John Barry. Rumours circled in late 2016 about a reunion and a tour with Richard, but this did not occur. On 1 May 2020, BBC4 showed The Shadows at Sixty, a documentary looking back at their success as they celebrated the 60th anniversary of their first No 1 hit, \\"Apache\\". Marvin, Welch and Bennett all gave interviews and the programme included some previously unseen footage from their early days. Marvin, Welch, and Bennett performed a new version of ‚ÄúApache,‚Äù without bass and percussion, for use in the documentary.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MWp3xb7NNVghttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wdU5BsKdGCc The Shadows reuniting with Sir Cliff Richard in 2009 Style and image The Shadows are difficult to categorise because of their stylistic range, which includes pop, rock, surf rock and ballads with a jazz influence. Most tunes are instrumental rock, with a few vocal numbers. Their rhythmic style is primarily on the beat, with little syncopation. They said in 1992 that \\"Apache\\" set the tone with its surf guitar sound. =Band logo= The Shadows and their management did not exploit commercial opportunities such as self- promotion via artwork. They allowed Vox to produce metallic badges in a script typeface, with the group name on the front bottom right corner of all three Vox cabinets sometime during the early 1960s. This badge became the \\"default\\" band logo but was never commercially exploited by the group. The Shadows never used the logo on the front of the bass drum, preferring to allow Meehan and Bennett to use their names instead. Belatedly, the logo was used once on the front artwork of the 1975 original studio album Specs Appeal. As of 2009, the logo still remains untrademarked and uncopyrighted. In lieu of a proper band logo, four silhouettes of the original line-up, in ascending order of height, were used as a pseudo-logo on concert programme covers and artwork projects such as sheet music, EP and album covers. From left to right after the drum- kit were Meehan, Harris, Marvin, and Bruce Welch. The original artwork group silhouette was modified each time a member changed: the last version featured Brian Bennett and Rostill in the late 1960s. During the 1970s, EMI dropped the silhouettes, preferring to use three guitar necks or colour photos of the Shadows. During the later 1980s, Polydor used a red Fender Stratocaster (with white scratch plate) as a symbol. =The Shadows' walk= In 1958, Bruce Welch went to a concert as part of the 1958 Jerry Lee Lewis tour of the UK of which he said: > On the show was this black American band called the Treniers. Hank Marvin > and I were at the back, and we were really impressed at the way the > saxophone players moved in unison, taken, I suppose, from the Glenn Miller > days. It looked fantastic and we thought, \\"We must do something like that > because it looks so interesting from the front.\\" The Shadows developed sequences using their bodies and guitars in tempo with the music, such as 'the walk'. It has been copied by other groups as part of their Top of the Pops performances, notably Mud, the Rubettes, Showaddywaddy and Yellow Dog. 'The walk' is three steps within a 60‚Äì60‚Äì60-degree triangle, with a reverse right-heel back-kick, with optional can-can finale. This was varied throughout a gig during certain numbers, for example \\"FBI\\". During the 1980s, rather than play in a static posture during an instrumental number, or using the walk, their live act was refined to include another movement. This featured Marvin, Welch and the bassist moving their guitars in time, or in sequence, with note or chord changes. Occasionally, during other instrumentals, this guitar presentation is re-engineered with Marvin and Welch acting out of sequence or alternating. When the group performed the popular live number \\"Shadoogie\\" (originally a track on their first LP), Hank and Bruce would walk forward whilst the bass player would walk back - and vice versa. =Stage names= During the late 1950s in the UK, it was a common practice for pop stars to adopt a stage name, and several members of the original Cliff Richard and the Shadows did so: Harry Webb became \\"Cliff Richard\\", Brian Rankin became \\"Hank B. Marvin\\", Terence Harris became \\"Jet Harris\\" and Bruce Cripps became \\"Bruce Welch\\". Subsequently, the names Cliff Richard and Hank Brian Marvin were confirmed by deed poll. Legacy and influence The Shadows have been cited as a major influence on many guitarists, including Brian May, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Andy Summers, Ritchie Blackmore, David Gilmour, and Tony Iommi. A tribute album, Twang! A Tribute to Hank Marvin & the Shadows (Capitol 33928), in October 1996 featured Blackmore, Iommi, Peter Green, Randy Bachman, Neil Young, Mark Knopfler, Peter Frampton and others playing Shadows hits. The early set of Queen (who played their first gig on 27 June 1970 with Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor and Brian May) included a cover of Cliff and the Shadows' \\"Please Don't Tease\\".Blake, Mark (2010). Is This The Real Life? The Untold Story of Queen. p. 96. Arum Press. The Shadows influenced 1960s Yugoslav beat bands like Crni Biseri, Elipse, Iskre, Siluete, Tomi Sovilj i Njegove Siluete and Zlatni Deƒçaci, all of whom were the pioneers of the Yugoslav rock scene. In the words of Crni Biseri member Vladimir Jankoviƒá \\"Jet\\" (who got his nickname after Harris), \\"even the Beatles weren't as popular in Belgrade as the Shadows were\\". The second episode of Rockovnik, a Serbian 2011 documentary series about the Yugoslav rock scene, deals with the appearance of the Shadows and the influence they had on Yugoslav bands.

The population is 131,264 (2012 census).Statistical Institute The city has been governed by mayor Alaaddin Yƒ±lmaz (AK Party) since local elections in 2004. It was the site of Ancient Claudiopolis and has also been called Eskihisar (\\"old fortress\\") (and as such has several Turkish namesakes). Bolu is on the old highway from Istanbul to Ankara, which climbs over Mount Bolu, while the new motorway passes through Mount Bolu Tunnel below the town.  History  The Bronze age artifact in Bolu Museum The statue from Antonine Dynasty period, 2nd century AD, of crystalline white marble and stems from Bithynia - Claudiopolis in Bolu Museum. = Antiquity until the Seljuk Turks = Bolu was part of one of the Hittite kingdoms around 2000 BC and later 500 BC became one of the leading cities of the Kingdom of Bithynia (279 BC - 79 BC). Bebryces, Mariandynes, Koukones, Thyns and Paphlagons are native people of the area in antique era. Strabo (XII, 4, 7) mentions a Hellenistic town, Bithynium (), celebrated for its pastures and cheese, which according to Pausanias (VIII, 9) was founded by Arcadians from Mantinea.History of Bolu (tr) Bolu In the Ancient Roman era, as is shown by its coins, the town was commonly called Claudiopolis after Emperor Claudius. It was the birthplace of Antinous, the posthumously deified lover of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who was very generous to the city, and his name was later added to that of Claudius on the coins of the city. Emperor Theodosius II (408-50) made it the capital of a new province, formed out of Bithynia and Paphlagonia, and called by him Honorias in honour of his younger son and successor Honorius. The city was known under Byzantine rule as Hadrianopolis (like many other; not to be confused with Hadrianopolis in Honoriade, also Constanti(n)a, now Viran≈üehir). Turkmens migrating west settled the city in the 11th century and it was referred to as Boli, Turkicized short for the Greek Polis 'city'. It was recaptured by Byzantines in 1097 but was conquered by the Great Seljuk Sultanate of Rum in 1197. = The Ottoman era = In 1325, the town was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, becoming known under the present Turkish name (sometimes called Bolou or Boli). It was also ruled by Candaroƒülu between 1402 and 1423. It became the chief town of a sanjak in the vilayet (province) of Kastamonu and had a population of 10,000 inhabitants. In the late 19th and early 20th century, (after 1864 with Vilayetler Nizannamesi) Bolu was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. Bolu was an Ottoman state (eyalet) until Vilayetler Nizannamesi 1864 and was covering from Beykoz kazasi of ƒ∞smid Sanjak to Boyabat kazasi of Sinop Sanjak.  Ecclesiastical history  = (Arch)Bishopric = As secular capital of the Roman province of Honorias, in the civil Diocese of Pontus, the bishopric of Claudiopolis became the metropolitan see, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, with five suffragan sees : Heraclea Pontica, Prusias ad Hypium, Tium, Cratia and Hadrianopolis in Honoriade. It appears as such in the Notitiae Episcopatuum of Pseudo-Epiphanius of about 640 and in that of Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise of the early 10th century, ranking sixteenth viz. seventeenth among the Patriarchate's Metropolitans. The city, known as Hadrianopolis (like many other) under Byzantine rule fell to Turkmens migrating west in the 11th century who called it Boli, was recaptured by Byzantines in 1097, besieged unsuccessfully by the Sultanate of Rum in 1177 and reconquered in 1197. Under Ottoman rule since the 14th century it lost to Heraclea Pontica the Metropolitan dignity. It ceased to exist as a residential bishopric in the 15th century. Michel Lequien mentions twenty bishops of the see to the 13th century; documentary mentions are available for the following incumbent (Arch)bishops : * the first is St. Autonomus, said to be an Italian missionary who suffered martyrdom under Diocletian. * Callicrates (mentioned in 363 in Socrates Scolasticus' church history) * Gerontius (first actual historically documented bishop, in 394 attending the council against Metropolitan Bagadius of Bosra. * Olympius (in 431) * Calogerus (449 - 458) * Carterius (menzionato nel 459) * Hypatus (circa 518) [dismissed by Janin] * Epictetus (in 536)  Vincentius (in 553) [dismissed by Janin] * Ciprianus I (in 680)  only Janin also includes a bishop Sisinnius, attending the council in Trullo (692), but apparently assigns the same to namesake see Claudiopolis in Isauria * Nicetas I (in 787) * Ignatius, a friend and correspondent of Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople * Ciprianus II (869 - 879) * Nicetas II (10th-11th centuries)Catalogue of Byzantine Seals at Dumbarton Oaks and in the Fogg Museum of Art, vol.

Wildlife within Yedig√∂ller National Park includes, but is not limited to, red deer, roe deer, wild boar, brown bears, wolves, red fox, lynx, jungle cats, otters and squirrels. The countryside around Bolu offers excellent walking and other outdoor pursuits. There are hotels in the town. Sights near the town include: * The 14th-century mosque, Ulu Jamii. * Bolu Museum holding artifacts from Hittite, Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk and Ottoman periods. * The hot springs Kaplƒ±calar. * Lake Abant and village of G√∂lk√∂y, near the university campus. * The famous crater lake called G√∂lc√ºk. * Hayreddin-i Tokadi, the local saint whose his shrine is visited by the folk in an annual festival.Hayreddin-i Tokadi siteLocation of Hayreddin-i Tokadi  Culture  = Architecture and sights = Bolu is home to examples of Ottoman architecture. The Grand Mosque dates to 1899, but was originally built by Bayezid I and is home to decorations that resemble embroideries. The Kadƒ± Mosque is perhaps the best example of classical Ottoman architecture in the city, having been built in 1499 and having its entrance embroidered with ornate k√ºndekari works.B√ºy√ºk Larousse, vol. 4 (1992), p. 1781, Milliyet Gazetesi Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, \\"Bolu\\".

The remains of the ancient city of Bithynium have been found in four hills in the city centre, Kargatepe, Hisartepe, Hƒ±dƒ±rlƒ±ktepe and the Uƒüurlunaip Hill. In Hƒ±dƒ±rlƒ±ktepe, a tomb and the remains of a theatre have been uncovered. In Hisartepe, a temple believed to have been built by the Roman emperor Hadrian for his lover Antinous has been excavated. In 1911, it was noted that \\"in and around [Bolu] are numerous marbles with Greek inscriptions, chiefly sepulchral, and architectural fragments.\\" Bolu Museum was established in 1975 to display and protect artifacts found in the Bolu area. It functions as both an archaeological and an ethnographic museum and is home to 3286 archaeological and 1677 ethnographic artifacts, as well as 12,095 historical coins. The archaeological artifacts chronicle the history of the area from Neolithic to Byzantine eras.

Economy  Mount Bolu Tunnel Bolu is a busy market town rather than a large city. It has one long shopping street and an attractive forested mountain countryside. Students from the university and soldiers based in Bolu make an important contribution to the local economy, which traditionally depended on forestry and handicrafts. Market day is Monday, when people from the surrounding villages come into town for their weekly shop. The main road from Istanbul to Ankara used to cross Bolu mountain, although more people would stop at the roadside restaurants than actually come into the town, and anyway now the Mount Bolu Tunnel is open most people will rush by on the motorway rather than climb up into Bolu, especially in winter when the road has often been closed due to ice and snow. Some of the service stations on the mountain road have already announced their closure or moved elsewhere.  Climate  Bolu has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb), with cold and snowy winters and warm summers with cool nights. Unlike the low-lying, sheltered city center, many parts of the province, like Gerede, have a humid continental climate (Dfb), due to very cold winters. January mean temperature is 0.7 ¬∞C, and temperatures rarely rise more than 12.3 ¬∞C and rarely drop below -15.0 ¬∞C during winter months. July mean temperature is 19.9 ¬∞C and temperatures rarely drop below 8.3 ¬∞C and rarely rise up to 32.2 ¬∞C in summer months. Lowest temperature recorded is -34 ¬∞C (-29.2 ¬∞F) in February 1929, and the highest was 39.8 ¬∞C (103.6 ¬∞F) in August 2006. Record snow thickness was 72 cm (28.3 inches) in February 1950. Bolu is a usually cloudy and foggy city and annual sunshine hours are about to be 1,600.Bolu's climate is similar to Budapest's climate.

The term is not necessarily a diagnosis since it requires an evaluation to determine the cause of the hypoglycemia. The condition is related to homeostatic systems used by the body to control the blood sugar level. It is described as a sense of tiredness, lethargy, irritation, or hangover, although the effects can be lessened if a lot of physical activity is undertaken in the first few hours after food consumption. The alleged mechanism for the feeling of a crash is correlated with an abnormally rapid rise in blood glucose after eating. This normally leads to insulin secretion (known as an insulin spike), which in turn initiates rapid glucose uptake by tissues, either storing it as glycogen or using it for energy production. The consequent fall in blood glucose is indicated as the reason for the \\"sugar crash\\". Another cause might be hysteresis effect of insulin action, i.e., the effect of insulin is still prominent even if both plasma glucose and insulin levels were already low, causing a plasma glucose level eventually much lower than the baseline level. Sugar crashes are not to be confused with the after-effects of consuming large amounts of protein, which produces fatigue akin to a sugar crash, but are instead the result of the body prioritising the digestion of ingested food. The prevalence of this condition is difficult to ascertain because a number of stricter or looser definitions have been used. It is recommended that the term reactive hypoglycemia be reserved for the pattern of postprandial hypoglycemia which meets the Whipple criteria (symptoms correspond to measurably low glucose and are relieved by raising the glucose), and that the term idiopathic postprandial syndrome be used for similar patterns of symptoms where abnormally low glucose levels at the time of symptoms cannot be documented. To assist in diagnosis, a doctor may order an HbA1c test, which measures the blood sugar average over the two or three months before the test. The more specific 6-hour glucose tolerance test can be used to chart changes in the patient's blood sugar levels before ingestion of a special glucose drink and at regular intervals during the six hours following to see if an unusual rise or drop in blood glucose levels occurs. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), a blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) at the time of symptoms followed by relief after eating confirms a diagnosis for reactive hypoglycemia.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms vary according to individuals' hydration level and sensitivity to the rate and/or magnitude of decline of their blood glucose concentration. A crash is usually felt within four hours of heavy carbohydrate consumption. Along with the symptoms of hypoglycemia, symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia include: *double vision or blurry vision *unclear thinking *brain fog *insomnia *heart palpitation or fibrillation *fatigue *dizziness *light-headedness *sweating *headaches *depression *nervousness *muscle twitches *irritability *tremors *flushing *craving sweets *increased appetite *rhinitis *nausea, vomiting *panic attack *numbness/coldness in the extremities *confusion *irrationality *hot flashes *bad temper *paleness *anxiety *trouble talking *cold hands *disorientation *the need to sleep or 'crash' The majority of these symptoms, often correlated with feelings of hunger, mimic the effect of inadequate sugar intake as the biology of a crash is similar in itself to the body's response to low blood sugar levels following periods of glucose deficiency.  Causes  The NIH states: \\"The causes of most cases of reactive hypoglycemia are still open to debate. Some researchers suggest that certain people may be more sensitive to the body‚Äôs normal release of the hormone epinephrine, which causes many of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Others believe deficiencies in glucagon secretion might lead to reactive hypoglycemia. Several other hormones are responsible for modulating the body's response to insulin, including cortisol, growth hormone and sex hormones. Untreated or under-treated hormonal disorders such as adrenal insufficiency (see also Addison's disease) or growth hormone deficiency can therefore sometimes cause insulin hypersensitivity, and reactive hypoglycemia. Stomach bypass surgery or hereditary fructose intolerance are believed to be causes, albeit uncommon, of reactive hypoglycemia. Myo-inositol or 1D-chiro-inositol withdrawal can cause temporary reactive hypoglycemia. There are several kinds of reactive hypoglycemia: # Alimentary hypoglycemia (consequence of dumping syndrome; it occurs in about 15% of people who have had stomach surgery) # Hormonal hypoglycemia (e.g., hypothyroidism) # Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis (some reports suggest this bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reactive hypoglycemia) # Congenital enzyme deficiencies (hereditary fructose intolerance, galactosemia, and leucine sensitivity of childhood)-Updated March 2018 # Late hypoglycemia (occult diabetes; characterized by a delay in early insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells, resulting in initial exaggeration of hyperglycemia during a glucose tolerance test) \\"Idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia\\" is a term no longer used because researchers now know the underlying causes of reactive hypoglycemia and have the tools to perform the diagnosis and the pathophysiological data explaining the mechanisms. To check if there is real hypoglycemia when symptoms occur, neither an oral glucose tolerance test nor a breakfast test is effective; instead, a hyperglucidic breakfast test or ambulatory glucose testing is the current standard. The body requires a relatively constant input of glucose, a sugar produced upon digestion of carbohydrates, for normal functioning. Glucagon and insulin are among the hormones that ensure a normal range of glucose in the human body. Upon consumption of a meal, blood sugar normally rises, which triggers pancreatic cells to produce insulin. This hormone initiates the absorption of the just- digested blood glucose as glycogen into the liver for metabolism or storage, thereby lowering glucose levels in the blood. In contrast, the hormone glucagon is released by the pancreas as a response to lower than normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon initiates uptake of the stored glycogen in the liver into the bloodstream so as to increase glucose levels in the blood. Sporadic, high-carbohydrate snacks and meals are deemed the specific causes of sugar crashes. The ‚Äúcrash‚Äù one feels is due to the rapid increase and subsequent decline of blood sugar in the body system as one begins and ceases consumption of high-sugar foods. More insulin than is actually needed is produced in response to the large, rapid ingestion of sugary foods.  Treatment  tuna fish and a single serving of starchy pasta. Reactive hypoglycemia can usually be relieved by dietary changes: * Avoiding or limiting sugar intake, including candy, sweet desserts, fruit juice, and drinks with added sugar.Kenrose, S. The Reactive Hypoglycemia Sourcebook, 2009. \\" * Eating only small amounts of starchy foods, including potatoes, pasta, breakfast cereals, and rice. * Eating a variety of foods, including:  eggs, nuts, dairy products, tofu, beans, lentils, meat, poultry, fish, or other sources of protein with every meal or snack,  whole-grain carbohydrates, such as eating whole wheat bread instead of white bread, and  more fruits and vegetables (but not fruit juice), with 5 A Day being a recommended goal for most people. * Eating more high-fiber foods, such as lentils, beans, pulses (legumes), leafy greens, and most fruits and vegetables. Other tips to prevent sugar crashes include: * Exercising regularly, as exercise increases cellular sugar uptake, which decreases excessive insulin release. * Avoiding eating meals or snacks composed entirely of carbohydrates; simultaneously ingest fats and proteins, which have slower rates of absorption; * Consistently choosing longer lasting, complex carbohydrates to prevent rapid blood-sugar dips in the event that one does consume a disproportionately large amount of carbohydrates with a meal; * Monitoring any effects medication may have on symptoms. Low- carbohydrate diet and/or frequent small meals is the first treatment of this condition. The first important point is to add small meals at the middle of the morning and of the afternoon, when glycemia would start to decrease. If adequate composition of the meal is found, the fall in blood glucose is thus prevented. Patients should avoid rapidly absorbed sugars and thus avoid popular soft drinks rich in glucose or sucrose. They should also be cautious with drinks associating sugar and alcohol, mainly in the fasting state. As it is a short-term ailment, a sugar crash that was not caused by injecting too much insulin does not usually require medical intervention in most people. The most important factors to consider when addressing this issue are the composition and timing of foods. Acute (short-term) low blood sugar symptoms are best treated by consuming small amounts of sweet foods, so as to regain balance in the body's carbohydrate metabolism. Suggestions include sugary foods that are quickly digested, such as: * Dried fruit * Soft drinks * Juice * Sugar as sweets, tablets or cubes. The anti-hypertensive class of medication known as calcium channel blockers could be useful for reactive hypoglycemia as inhibition of the calcium channels on beta islet cells can help prevent an overproduction of insulin after a meal is eaten. Postprandial syndrome : If there is no hypoglycemia at the time of the symptoms, this condition is called idiopathic postprandial syndrome. It might be an \\"adrenergic postprandial syndrome\\"  blood glucose levels are normal, but the symptoms are caused through autonomic adrenergic counterregulation. Often, this syndrome is associated with emotional distress and anxious behaviour of the patient. This is often seen in dysautonomic disorders as well. Dietary recommendations for reactive hypoglycemia can help to relieve symptoms of postprandial syndrome.

Sheila \\"Shea\\" Chambers and Shaun Murphy (also known as Stoney Reese) were vocalists in Knape's band, as well as pre-RCA Victor recording artist Dan Schafer on guitar and vocals with Jim Langois on drums, Dave Heater on sax and Jack Muncie on trumpet. In the early 1990s, former Doors guitarist Robbie Krieger formed a trio called The Robby Krieger Organization featuring Knape on electric organ and organ pedal bass and Dale Alexander on drums and backing vocals. Teegarden & Van Winkle reunited for another album, Radioactive, in 1997. In 2012, Knape was working and recording with the Stronghold Rockin Blues Quest in Southern California. He can be seen in the Strong Rhythm and Blues Quartet's video \\"Big Girl\\" featuring Chuck Strong on drums and vocals. In 2016, Van Winkle began performing every Tuesday night at Bergie's steakhouse in Santa Clarita, California. Skip (Knape) Van Winkle died on 27 November 2018 at age 74.

U 990 has a stylized cross. U 991 has the same runic text as U 937. U 999 is the oldest of the four stones. The Funbo runestones constitute a group of four runestones originally from Funbo in the province of Uppland, Sweden, which were raised by members of the same family during the eleventh century. The following presentations show the runic script transliterated into Latin script, together with transcriptions into the Old West Norse and Old East Norse dialects of Old Norse and translations into English. The runestones are listed in order of their Rundata catalog listing, chronologically U 999 is the oldest inscription and is followed by U 990 and then the two stones U 937 and U 991. U 937 The runestone designated as U 937 in the Rundata catalog was found in Uppsala in 1875 in the walls of a Franciscan monastery between the streets of St. Persgatan and Klostergatan, and is currently located at a park in Uppsala University. The fact that its inscription mentions names from the same family as the runestones of Funbo, shows that it was formerly part of the same group. Like many other runestones, it had been used as construction material at a time when the historical significance of the stones was not understood. It is considered to be a good example of runestone style Pr3, which is also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animals heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. On this stone the runic text lies within a serpent that circles a triquetra, which would have been considered a high status motif. Because the runic text of runestones U 937 and U 991 have the same message, it has been suggested that they were once at the same site and formed a coupled memorial to the deceased brother Ve√∞r. They are considered to be the most recent of the four Funbo inscriptions and, although unsigned, are considered to be the work of the runemaster Fot. He is known for his Urnes style inscriptions and for the consistency of his use of the punctuation mark √ó between words, as shown in the runic text of this runestone. =Inscription= Transliteration: :√ó √æiak(n) √ó auk √ó kunar √ó raistu √ó stana √ó afti Ä √ó ua√ær √ó bru√æur sin √óProject Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for U 937.

The Vientiane Treaty was in some sense a corollary to the Paris Peace Accords, signed the month before, which had ended U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war. Just as the Paris Accords had mandated the withdrawal of all US forces in Vietnam, the Vientiane Treaty called for the removal from Laos of all foreign forces allied to each side. Under the terms of the treaty, a new coalition government was to be created; security in major cities (such as Vientiane) was to be undertaken by joint forces from both sides. There were no outside guarantees to the terms, as the agreement was only between the Lao factions; the ICC (which had overseen the 1954 Geneva Accords ending the First Indochina War) was more powerless than before to monitor compliance. The coalition government envisaged by the treaty did not long outlast it; as with the treaty itself, events in Laos emulated those in Vietnam. Shortly after the fall of the South Vietnamese government on 30 April 1975, the Pathet Lao took over Laos on 15 August 1975.

The distance is approximately .Max Wooldridge, London to Suffolk on two wheels and a baked potato, 24 June 2001, The Independent The ride takes place overnight, hence \\"Dynamo\\". It is usually scheduled to take place on the Saturday night closest to the full moon in July, partly for tradition but also because it is easier to ride by moonlight.Matt Seaton, Two wheels, 27 Sept 2007, The Guardian The date for DD20 was moved to 30 June/1 July 2012 to avoid clashing with the Olympics. The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. History The event was started in 1993 when Patrick Field, of the London School of Cycling, converted an informal ride into an organised event. It was sponsored by Mosquito Bikes of Essex Road, Islington, with some mechanical support and \\"controls\\" where riders had to check in to stamp an Audax-style ‚ÄúBrevet card‚Äù. During this period the ride started from the Eastway cycle circuit rather than London Fields as at present. After about 4 years the ride, which had become very popular, continued on an unsupported 'turn up and go' basis. The controls and support ended, and the organisation of transport back from Dunwich at the end of the ride was arranged by Southwark Cyclists. For many years this was managed by Barry Mason. The number of participants has increased every year, to an estimated 1,000 riders in 2009James Randerson, A moonlit bike ride to remember: the legendary Dunwich Dynamo, The Guardian, 7 July 2009 and 1,500 in 2011.Southwark Cyclists,Dunwich Dynamo FAQs ,Organisers website, 8 June 2012 By 2015 over 2,000 participants started the ride. Due to the increasing numbers of participants the once adequate feeding arrangements have become overwhelmed and a number of \\"pop up\\" food stands have been introduced, with the blessing of the organisers, to help meet demand. The main feeding stop was moved from the small village hall at Great Waldingfield (approximately out) to Sible Hedingham (about out) in 2010. Due to noise and littering issues Sible Hedingham was withdrawn as a feeding stop and from 2016 onwards the main feeding stop is at the Fire Station in Sudbury ( out) with the profits going towards the Firefighters Charity. = Unusual vehicles = In 2009, the ride was completed on a penny farthing.

Often religious themes are used to convey a broader message, but others confront the subject head-on‚Äîcontemplating, for example, how attitudes towards faith might shift in the wake of ever-advancing technological progress, or offering creative scientific explanations for the apparently mystical events related in religious texts (gods as aliens, prophets as time travelers, etc.). As an exploratory medium, science fiction rarely takes religion at face value by simply accepting or rejecting it; when religious themes are presented, they tend to be investigated deeply. Some science fiction works portray invented religions, either placed into a contemporary Earth society (such as the Earthseed religion in Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower), or in the far future (as seen in Dune by Frank Herbert, with its Orange Catholic Bible). Other works examine the role of existing religions in a futuristic or alternate society. The classic Canticle for Leibowitz explores a world in which Catholicism is one of the few institutions to survive an apocalypse, and chronicles its slow re-achievement of prominence as civilisation returns. Christian science fiction also exists, sometimes written as allegory for inspirational purposes. Orson Scott Card has criticized the genre for oversimplifying religion, which he claims is always shown as \\"ridiculous and false\\".\\"On Religion in SF and Fantasy: An Interview with Orson Scott Card\\"; Writing World online Afterlife The Palace of Eternity (1969) by Bob Shaw * The Riverworld series, by Philip Jos√© Farmer * Ubik (1969) by Philip K. Dick ‚Äî In the novel, companies use a form of cryonic suspension (\\"cold-pac chambers\\") to preserve the deceased in a state of \\"half-life\\" which allows for limited consciousness and the ability to communicate with both the living world and others in half-life. (The half-life concept was first explored in Dick's 1964 novella, \\"What the Dead Men Say.\\") * The Divine Invasion (1981) by Philip K. Dick ‚Äî Dick revisits cryonic suspension in this novel, with two principle differences being that, here, (A) the clinically dead can be brought back to life with proper medical procedures (provided they do not lose brain function for too long a period before being suspended) and (B) the dreamlike state of one in cryonic suspension often takes the form of extended memories from the person's life. The Divine Invasion also explores more traditionally religious visions of afterlife; e.g., deities discuss a sifting bridge that must be crossed by the souls of the newly dead to be judged and the coming- about of an \\"Advocate\\" who speaks on behalf of those souls so that they need not be \\"plunged into the fiery pit of hell\\" (pp. 134‚Äì138). AngelsIn Out of the Silent Planet (1938; part of the Space Trilogy), by C. S. Lewis, the protagonist meets \\"eldila\\", mysterious beings of light native to the void of interplanetary space (who are actually what Christianity defines as \\"angels\\", and who are also identified as Mars, Venus and other deities of Greek and Roman mythology), and are completely loyal and obedient to God, and have never wanted to be worshiped as gods themselves (although the ancient Greeks and Romans mistakenly did so) Creation myths The film Prometheus (2012) explores the myth that human life did not arise spontaneously by chance, but that a humanoid species, the \\"Engineers\\", created life on Earth. They also taught humans how to use technology and visited the Earth sporadically. Some elements are similar to the Ancient Aliens myths. The story develops when a scientific expedition travels to confront their creators. * In the film Blade Runner (1982) based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Roy Batty is an artificial person looking to confront his creator, while Rick Deckard searches for lost humanity despite his job: hunting and \\"retiring\\" runaway replicants. * Mary Shelley's Frankenstein * The short story The Last Question (1956) by Isaac Asimov ‚Äì Humans of the future ask the supercomputer Multivac how the net amount of entropy of the universe can be massively decreased. Multivac fails, displaying the error message \\"INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER\\". The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally the universe dies with the exception of Cosmic AC ‚Äì Multivac's final successor. At that point it has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself. As the universe died, Multivac drew all of humanity into hyperspace, to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question. Ultimately, Multivac did decipher the answer, announcing \\"Let there be light!\\". * The early part of Tolkien's The Silmarillion provides a detailed Creation myth, with the world being created through the singing of Angel-like beings under the direction of God. Similar to the Christian account of The War in Heaven, this myth includes the rebellion of Melkor (equivalent of Lucifer/Satan) but considerably different in detail from the Christian account. Demons In the Doom series demons from Hell have come into the universe through an inter-dimensional portal which is located on Mars. * In Princess of Wands by John Ringo, a Christian housewife and soccer mom gets involved in an organization which co-operates with the FBI in dealing with demons. * In That Hideous Strength by C.

They can be summoned by certain groups of people with arcane knowledge. They are known as daemons, and the people who hunt them, daemon hunters. Devil The television series, Futurama, features a recurring character called the Robot Devil * In the 1975 Doctor Who episode \\"Pyramids of Mars\\", the Doctor states that Satan is one of the names the last of the Osirians, Sutekh (who considers all life his enemy), is known by.Doctor: \\"Serve you, Sutekh?

His name is Count Iblis ‚Äî Iblis being the Islamic name of the Devil. * The 2006 Doctor Who episodes \\"The Impossible Planet\\" and \\"The Satan Pit\\" feature an ancient being known as the Beast, which claims to be the basis of the Devil figure in all religions and mythologies; earlier in \\"The D√¶mons\\", it is shown a race resembling the typical image of the Devil had visited Earth and become the basis for both Gods and Demons. * In Perelandra by C. S. Lewis, the protagonist must fight against a man possessed by a demon, hinted to be the devil himself. * Ubik (1969) by Philip K. Dick ‚Äî In the novel, companies uses a form of cryonic suspension to preserve the deceased in a state of \\"half- life\\" which allows for limited consciousness and the ability to communicate. The recently deceased protagonist Joe Chip finds the \\"reality\\" of the half- life world around him decaying and temporally regressing and discovers that Jory Miller, another half-lifer, is the cause of this; Jory devours the life force of others in half-life in order to prolong his own existence. Ella, who has been in \\"half-life\\" for many years, instructs Joe Chip on the usage of the spray \\"Ubik\\" (whose name is derived from the Latin word ubique meaning \\"everywhere\\") which can preserve people in half-life from Jory's deleterious influence. While Ubik can be seen as a metaphor for God, Jory Miller can be seen as an allegorical representation of the Devil. * The Divine Invasion (1981) by Philip K. Dick ‚Äî In this second installment of the VALIS trilogy, Belial (also referred to as Satan, the Adversary, and the bright morning star who \\"Fell from heaven and began it all (p. 80)) is depicted as a little, foul- smelling goat kid who is accidentally released from his cage (p. 221). Satan is described as the \\"prosecutor of man in the divine court\\" who \\"impugns and indicts\\" souls, a role contrasted with \\"the Advocate who defends the accused human\\" (pp. 137‚Äì138). Belial is also presented as protagonist Herb Asher's yetzer ha-ra, whom Herb must not choose over his yetzer ha-tov (p. 253). * In the episode \\"Something Ricked This Way Comes\\" (2014) of the science fiction comedy television series Rick and Morty a character \\"Summer\\" reports to her first job in an antique shop run by the Devil that sells items that fulfill a desire for the owner but come at a price making the item essentially worthless (the shop and the Devil's name, Mr. Needful, are both references and parodies of the Stephen King novel Needful Things). During the episode a protagonist \\"Rick\\" sets up a competitive counter-business across the street that removes the curses and runs the Devil out of business. The Devil is so dismayed that he tries to kill himself but Summer finds himself in the middle of his suicide attempt and revives him. They relaunch with a new dot-com company that becomes wildly successful. As it turns out, the Devil had no plans to include Summer in reaping the profits and has her hauled off by security. Betrayed by the Devil, she and Rick build muscle mass to get physical revenge. * In an episode of Star Trek: The Animated Series called \\"The Magicks of Megas-tu\\" the Devil is captured by space-faring Puritans and is to be destroyed. Kirk argues in his defense. * In an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called \\"Devil's Due\\" a character named Ardra is an alien that uses technology to appropriate the religious myths of several planets. She takes the holographic form of several \\"Devils,\\" to extort goods and services from a terrified populace. Eschatology and the ultimate fate of the universe In the far future of Le Dernier Homme (1805) by Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville Earth is becoming sterile and the human ability to reproduce is failing. A man travels to the last fertile woman to begin a rebirth of the human race and at return meets Adam, the first man, who has been condemned by God to watch all the damned among his descendants enter Hell, and is now charged with persuading the pair not to prolong the life of humanity, which God has determined must now end. The world then begins to end the dead to rise from their graves while Ormus, the spirit of Earth, who cannot survive without humanity, despairs. * Omega: The Last Days of the World (1894) by Camille Flammarion * The poem Darkness (1816) by Lord Byron * Star Maker (1937) by Olaf Stapledon * The Nine Billion Names of God (1953) by Arthur C.

However, the starship with the book's protagonists on board survives because there is still enough uncondensed hydrogen for maneuvering, outside the monobloc, and eventually they could colonize one of the new universe's planets. * Manifold: Time (1999) by Stephen Baxter begins at the end of space and time, when the last descendants of humanity face an infinite but pointless existence. Due to proton decay the physical universe has collapsed, but some form of intelligence has survived by embedding itself into a lossless computing substrate where it can theoretically survive indefinitely. However, because there will never be new input, eventually all possible thoughts will be exhausted. Some portion of this intelligence decides that this should not have been the ultimate fate of the universe, and takes action to change the past, centering around the early 21st century. * Left Behind is a series of 16 best-selling novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, dealing with Christian dispensationalist End Times: the pretribulation, premillennial, Christian eschatological viewpoint of the end of the world. The primary conflict of the series is the members of the Tribulation Force against the Global Community and its leader Nicolae Carpathia‚Äîthe Antichrist. Left Behind is also the title of the first book in the series. The series was first published 1995‚Äì2007 by Tyndale House, a firm with a history of interest in dispensationalism. Evangelism In S. M. Stirling's Nantucket series, the entire island of Nantucket is suddenly transported into the past, to about 1300 BC and the modern Americans marooned in the past must make the best of the Bronze Age world in which they find themselves; the Christians among them face the dilemma of whether or not to embark on missionary activity and spread their religion - even though Jesus Christ had not yet been born, and the very act of their spreading Christianity might so fundamentally change the world that Jesus might never be born at all. * In The Sparrow, by Mary Doria Russell, most of the Jesuit missionaries sent to investigate a radio transmission from an unknown planet (believing that they have been chosen by God to be the first to set foot on an alien world) are killed by the planet's inhabitants; and the sole survivor is enslaved but eventually escapes and returns to Earth with his faith in tatters. Fictional religions A main theme of Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) is the fictional religion \\"Mercerism\\". It is Earth's main religion, in which Empathy Boxes link simultaneous users into a collective consciousness based on the suffering of Wilbur Mercer. In the shared experience of the Empathy Box, Wilbur Mercer takes an endless walk up a mountain while stones are thrown at him, the pain of which all users share. Television broadcasts of \\"Buster Friendly\\" represent a second religion, designed to undermine Mercerism. * The Earthseed religion in Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower * The Bajoran religion ‚Äì Star Trek: Deep Space Nine * Cavism in Gore Vidal's novel Messiah - a religion founded by John Cave, an American undertaker. Cave teaches, among other things, not to fear death and to actually desire it under certain circumstances. Later followers come to glorify death, and even enforce it on other members. The founder John Cave is himself ironically killed by his followers when he proves inconvenient for the new religion's development. Cavism eventually completely displaces and destroys Christianity, even to the extent of all Gothic Cathedrals being blown up and destroyed to erase all trace of it. * The Klingon religion and various other religions from Star Trek * Bene Gesserit, Buddislam, Maometh Saari, Mahayana Christianity, Zensunni Catholicism in Frank Herbert's Dune series * Bokononism and in Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut * Chernobog, the Satanic, cannibalistic, human-sacrificing god whose worship displaced Christianity in the remnants of Russia in the post-apocalyptic world of The Peshawar Lancers by S.

However, saying that in Tarxia might result in being burned as a heretic. * Goa'uld religion ‚Äì most Goa'uld pose as gods to control slave armies. \\"Goa'uld\\" means \\"God\\" in the Goa'uld language from the television series Stargate SG-1 * Hemilkism in The Gate of Time by Philip Jos√© Farmer - in an alternate history where there never was a Roman Empire and European culture has many Semitic elements, a major religion was founded in the Fourteenth Century by a charismatic Irish religious figure named Hemilka. While having some resemblances to Christianity, Hemilkism is not an imperialist faith and therefore does not dominate its world in the way Christianity does in ours. * Monism (specifically, Evangelical Monism) in Robert Heinlein's Tunnel in the Sky. In the last decades of the 21st Century, great waves of Monist proselyting swept out of Persia and numerous Westerners were converted. Two generations later, when the plot takes place, Evangelical Monism is one of the main religious denominations in the US, many American families observing the Monist ritual of lighting the Lamp of Peace during dinner. From references in the book, the Monist faith appears to be Deistic, with a generalized acceptance of a deity having no particular defining characteristics or abilities, and including significant elements of Fire worship - suggesting the influence Mazdaism, the pre-Islamic fire-worshiping religion of Persia. For such a religion to be strongly established in modern Persia/Iran implies a major upheaval in the position of Islam there - for which Heinlein provides no information . * Ori religion - the main antagonist in Stargate SG-1 after the fall of the Goa'uld. Ori, ascended beings, relatives and mortal enemies of the Ancients, thrive on the life force stolen from their worshippers. The clash is finally resolved in the movie Stargate: The Ark of Truth. * Church of Science ‚Äì the bogus religion established by Salvor Hardin in Isaac Asimov's Foundation * Soterism - in the alternate history of L. Sprague de Camp's Aristotle and the Gun, Christianity never arose. Its place during the Roman Empire was taken by Soterism, an Egypto-Hellenic synthesis founded by a fiery Egyptian prophet, whose followers called him \\"Soter\\" - the Greek word for \\"Savior\\". Soterism did not become as powerful as Christianity in the history we know, with Mitraism and Odinism surviving at its side. In later times, followers of these religions hounded the scientist Georg Schwartzhorn (much as Galileo was persecuted in our history). * Church of Humanity Unchained - the primary religion of the Grayson and Masada systems in the Honorverse. (Two churches, with one origin, but now mutually implacably hostile, with massively different theologies.) * In John Varley's story \\"Equinoctial\\",Included in \\"Picnic on Nearside\\", New York, 1980 the Rings of Saturn are inhabited by the followers of two mutually antagonistic religions. The Church of Cosmic Engineering (informally The Engineers), founded by Ringpainter the Great, considers it a Sacred Duty to paint red the Rings of Saturn - a duty holy enough to be worth the devoting of one's entire lifetime to it. The opposing Conservationist Church (Consers in short) is equally certain that painting the Rings is the Ultimate Sacrilege and that undoing all such painting is the task to which one should devote one's life. The two are involved in a centuries-long, fierce religious war - both equally certain that the issue of painting or unpainting the Rings fully justifies killing on sight any member of the opposing Church (see Eight Worlds#Symbiotic spacesuits). *In Fallout there is a religious, cult-like group known as The Children of Atom. They worship a god-like entity known as Atom and believe in an afterlife of sorts, which is known as the great beyond. The group is known for worshipping nuclear weapons. They set up churches in radioactive areas to stay closer to Atom. * Cthulhu Mythos deities * In The Magic Labyrinth, the fifth volume of Philip Jose Farmer's Riverworld series, humans from different times and places who were resurrected on the banks of a great river in another world, found the pacifist Church of the Second Chance offering resurrected people a second chance, to live a more moral life than their earlier one. Both Hermann G√∂ring and Erik Bloodaxe take this chance in all sincerity, becoming adherents of the pacifist Church.

K. Chesterton * Neverness, by David Zindell * Parable of the Sower, by Octavia E. Butler, features a religion called Earthseed, where \\"God is change\\". * In the TV series Stargate SG-1, and the 1994 Stargate film, the supposed ancient gods are revealed to be powerful, parasitic aliens posing as supernatural beings to exploit mankind. Stargate SG-1 later introduces the Ancients and the Ori, who are basically indistinguishable from actual gods - particularly the Ori who command worship and actually gain power by it. * In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode, \\"Who Watches the Watchers\\", a serious accident with a hidden scientific observation post starts a chain of events that leads to a primitive civilization becoming convinced that the Starfleet personnel are divine beings with Capt. Jean-Luc Picard being the supreme one; and the crew of the Enterprise struggle to prevent the reestablishment of religion in the civilization. * In the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \\"Who Mourns for Adonais?\\", the Enterprise crew encounters an alien figure who is the ancient Greek god, Apollo. * In Philip K. Dick's novel, VALIS, the protagonist faces an all-powerful God who subtly manipulates the actions and thoughts of humans in an effort to redeem humanity. * Ubik (1969) by Philip K. Dick ‚Äî After dying and being placed into a form of cryonic suspension called \\"half-life,\\" protagonist Joe Chip and his colleagues find the \\"reality\\" of the half-life world around them decaying and temporally regressing; one-by-one, Joe Chip's colleagues are shrivelling up and their consciousnesses are dying. Ubik, a spray product whose name is derived from the Latin word ubique meaning \\"everywhere\\", can preserve people in half-life from this regression. Dick's former wife Tessa remarked that \\"Ubik is a metaphor for God. Ubik is all- powerful and all-knowing, and Ubik is everywhere. The spray can is only a form that Ubik takes to make it easy for people to understand it and use it\\".UBIK Explained, sort of Tessa Dick, It's a Philip K. Dick World, December 4, 2008 The metaphor is also made clear in a passage of the book. * The protagonist of The Worthing Saga, by Orson Scott Card, keeps himself in hidden stasis over the years, and becomes the target of worship by the descendants of the very settlers that he delivered to a new world * James K. Morrow's Godhead trilogy considers the literal death of God, when the two-mile-long corpse of God is found floating at sea. In the first volume, Towing Jehovah (Harcourt Brace, 1994) the angel Raphael calls on supertanker captain Anthony Van Horne to tow the body to an icy tomb in the north, while the faithful and unbelieving alike seek to deal with the fallout of the death of God. * In the short story The Last Question (1956) by Isaac Asimov humans of the future ask the supercomputer Multivac how the net amount of entropy of the universe can be massively decreased. Multivac fails, displaying the error message \\"INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER\\". The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally the universe dies with the exception of Cosmic AC ‚Äì Multivac's final successor. At that point it has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself. As the universe died, Multivac drew all of humanity into hyperspace, to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question. Ultimately, Multivac did decipher the answer, announcing \\"Let there be light!\\" and essentially ascending to the state of God in the Old Testament. * In Sara Paretsky's novel Ghost Country, an ancient Mesopotamian fertility goddess calling herself Starr appears in present-day Chicago. She exudes an overwhelming sexuality, affecting both men and women, and attracts an enormous crowd of worshipers, especially from among Chicago's poor and homeless. To the chagrin and scandal of Protestant and Catholic clergy alike, she emulates many of the miracles of Jesus Christ - feeding many people with minute amounts of food, healing the sick and also bringing the dead back to life. Finally she is lynched by a mob of bigoted Christians inside one of the city's most prestigious churches - but her body unaccountably disappears from the morgue three days later, though no one actually saw her rise. Thus disappearing, she has had an enormous - and on whole, positive - impact on the lives of all the book's cast of characters. * In the universal roleplaying setting Nova Praxis, a supercomputer with the ability to process theoretical environments encompassing all laws of physics, was created. It started inventing all kinds of obscure technology and jumped human technology and civilization forwards by over a millennium, before suddenly shutting down after 3 months of work, likely due to system overload. The computer, called Mimir (pronounced \\"me-mer\\"), is considered by some to be a deity, prophesied to return to gift humanity with the ultimate ascension, and the virtual-reality library that contains all the data produced by \\"her\\", called \\"The black library\\" due to its black-and-white design, is considered a holy place of pilgrimage.Nova Praxis, Savage Worlds edition, Void Star Studios Heaven and paradise \\"The Reformers\\" (Weird Science #20) ‚Äî When three space men dressed in scifi versions of religious garb land on a planet to \\"free it of evil;\\" they are greeted by a man named Peter who informs them they are not needed (for there is no crime, no immorality, nor any of the evils seen in other societies); so they plan to create evil for which they can blame literature, clothing, and alcohol (as they have done on previous worlds)‚Äîincluding Earth‚Äîthey are contracted by their leader (the Devil) who informs that their efforts are doomed...because they have landed in Heaven. * In an alternate scene of Prometheus (2012) astronaut Elizabeth Shaw who survived the clash with god-like aliens who turned out to be rather malicious asks the AI David to navigate a stranded alien spaceship toward where the alien came from instead of back to Earth, saying \\"I don't want to go back to where we came from...I want to go where they came from...I want to go to paradise.\\"Questions about God and Paradise Lost (Source Quotes)Quote from the alternate scene: David: Dr. Shaw! Over here! Elizabeth Shaw: Where is my cross? David: The pouch in my utility belt...the other pouch. ...even after all this...you still believe, don't you? Elizabeth Shaw: You said you could figure out their navigation....use their maps. David: Yes, of course. Once we get to one of their other ships...finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward Elizabeth Shaw: I don't want to go back to where we came from...I want to go where they came from...I want to go to paradise. You think you can do that, David? David: Yes. I believe I can. May I ask what you hope to achieve by going there? Elizabeth Shaw: They created us. And they tried to kill us. They changed their minds. I deserve to know why. David: Does it matter why they changed their minds? Elizabeth Shaw: Heh. Yeah...yes, it does. David: I don't understand. Elizabeth Shaw: Well, I guess that's because I'm a human being...and you're a fucking robot. Do you mind? David: Mind? Previously Shaw has been portrayed as a deeply religious person whose first encounter with the concept of heaven or paradise stems from when her mother died ‚Äì a memory David coexperienced during Shaw's hypersleep. Previously an additional dialogue between Shaw and David was shown: > Elizabeth Shaw: Before that thing ripped your head off, what did he say, > David? > David (AI): \\"Thing;\\" Dr. Shaw? Not too long ago, you considered them gods. > Elizabeth Shaw: God never tried to kill me. So... what did he say? Where > did he come from? > David: There is no direct translation, but... Several of your ancient > cultures had a word similar to it... \\"Paradise\\". > :When David asks her what she hopes to achieve by going there she tells him that she wants to know why the aliens (the \\"Engineers\\") created humanity and why they later intended to destroy them. Hell In the cult science fiction/horror movie Event Horizon, the titular ship passes through an extra- dimensional realm, and the crew‚Äîpossessed by an entity from Hell‚Äîare driven murderously insane * \\"A Nice Place to Visit\\", a 1960 episode of The Twilight Zone * The short story \\"A Planet Named Shayol\\" (by Cordwainer Smith), was inspired by Dante's Inferno * The Divine Invasion (1981) by Philip K. Dick ‚Äî The novel states that \\"a sifting bridge had to be crossed by the newly dead person. If he was evil the bridge got narrower and narrower until he toppled off and plunged into the fiery pit of hell\\" (p. 134). Although this bridge was originally mechanical in its punishment of sinful souls, there one day came a new figure, the \\"Beside-Helper\\" or \\"Advocate,\\" who would defend and speak for anyone who accepted his assistance before stepping upon the bridge (p. 135), thereby \\"feed[ing] mercy into the circuit\\" (p. 136). Jesus \\"Give us Barabbas!\\" Were they all tourists? (from The Bible and its Story Taught by One Thousand Picture Lessons, 1910) * H.G. Wells' A Modern Utopia, takes place in an alternate timeline in which \\"Jesus Christ had been born into a liberal and progressive Roman Empire that spread from the Arctic Ocean to the Bight of Benin, and was to know no Decline and Fall\\" \\"A Modern Utopia,\\" Chapter 9  with profound implications for Jesus' religious teachings, and later on those of Muhammad * In Behold the Man, by Michael Moorcock, twentieth-century Karl Glogauer (a Jew obsessed with the figures of Jesus and Carl Jung), travels in time to the year 28 A.D. where he meets various New Testament figures (such as John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary), and discovers that Mary and Joseph's child, Jesus, is a mentally retarded hunchback, who could never become the Jesus as is portrayed in the Scriptures, and after having a mental breakdown, steps into the role of Jesus, eventually dying on the cross (having specifically asked Judas to betray him) * In The Didymus Contingency, by Jeremy Robinson, a scientist's time-travel to see Jesus' death and resurrection‚Äîonly to witness several scenes not recorded in the New Testament (while realizing Jesus was a fraud)‚Äîfaces the dilemma of whether or not to make a revelation in the present which would shake the foundations of Christianity is complicated further with the appearance of an assassin from a different futureNote: The Didymus of the title is the Apostle Saint Thomas, whose initial skepticism of the resurrection earned him the title \\"Doubting Thomas\\". * The Last Starship from Earth, by John Boyd, is set in a dystopian society in the very near future (in an alternate timeline) where Jesus Christ became a revolutionary agitator and was never subjected to crucifixion; and who overthrew the Roman Empire by force of arms, and established a theocracy that has lasted until the twentieth century * In Garry Kilworth's story Let's Go to Golgotha!, tourists from the future can book a time-traveling \\"Crucifixion Tour\\", but before setting out, they are strictly told that, when the crowd is asked whether Jesus or Barabbas should be spared, they must all join the call: \\"Give us Barabbas!\\"‚Äîhowever, when the moment comes, the protagonist suddenly realizes that the crowd condemning Jesus to the cross is composed entirely of tourists from the future, and that no actual Jewish Israelites of 33 A.D. are present at all * When the protagonists of Clifford Simak's Mastodonia make trips to the past commercially available, American church groups band together and seek to purchase an exclusive franchise for Jesus' time on Earth‚Äînot because they want to go there but because they do not want anyone at all to go there (the clergymen state quite forthrightly their apprehension that time travel would disprove some of the accounts given in the Gospels and thus undermine Christianity)‚Äîwhen refused, the church groups turn aggressive and energetically lobby Congress to ban time travel altogether; opening an enormous theological debate unresolved by the end of the book * Ray Bradbury's 1949 story \\"The Man,\\" reprinted in The Illustrated Man, tells of a miracle worker who matches the description of Jesus and who travels from planet to planet, healing and teaching. When a spaceship lands on one such planet and is told that the miracle worker had been there just the day before, the arrogant captain vows to chase him down through space until he catches him. After the captain blasts off again in search of the man, another spaceman, who chose to remain behind because of his faith having been awakened by the faith of the people on that planet, is told that the man is still there. * In The Rescuer, by Arthur Porges, future scientists destroy a three- billion dollar time-travel project because a religious fanatic had taken over the machine, heading for Golgotha with a rifle and five thousand rounds in an attempt to save Jesus and the affair must be kept from the public, since some might identify with \\"The Rescuer\\" * Resurrection Day (1999) by Thomas Wyckoff, is about a man sent back into time to steal Jesus' body to disprove Christianity * In There Will Be Time, by Poul Anderson, a young twentieth- century American (who has discovered that he has the ability to travel through time without any need of a machine) reasons that there must be others like him and that Jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion is a good place to try locating them, goes there and walks through the street singing the Greek mass (which is meaningless to people of the time), but get himself located by agents of a time-travel policing organization, who take him to their headquarters in the far future‚Äîwithout getting to see Jesus at all * In the TimeWars series by Simon Hawke, set in 2461, Cardinal Lodovico Consorti proposes to use the recently discovered time-travel technology to obtain empirical proof that Christ indeed rose from the dead after being crucified, causing the Catholic Church to excommunicate him (the Church hierarchy preferring to continue relying on faith alone and not seeking factual confirmation) * Times Without Number, by John Brunner, depicts an alternate reality in which the Spanish Armada had conquered England; and when time travel is discovered‚Äîcontrolled by the Catholic Church‚Äîit is decreed that every new pope would be privileged to travel to Palestine in the time of Christ's ministry, while everyone else is strictly forbidden to go there * In The Traveller, by Richard Matheson, a confirmed skeptic is chosen to be the first to travel in time to see the crucifixion (in a kind of traveling cage which makes him invisible to the people of the past) and he witnesses the actual event, causing him to feel empathy for Jesus; and is hauled back to the present after attempting to save him; and, although he had seen no miracles, he is a changed man, having seen \\"a man giving up his life for the things he believed\\" and stating, \\"that should be miracle enough for everybody\\" * The plot of Jesus Video, a German novel by Andreas Eschbach, revolves around the search for a hidden video camera that is believed to hold digital footage of Jesus recorded by a time travelerNote: The book, written in 1997, was adapted into a television movie called Das Jesus Video in 2002. The film was released in English under the title The Hunt for the Hidden Relic (or Hidden Relic). * In Robert Silverberg's Up the Line, featuring a company organizing tours into the past, a character notes that \\"the crowd at the Sermon on the Mount grows bigger and bigger, every time I go there again\\" *Robert Young wrote a short story called Time Travel, Inc where two men go back in time to meet Jesus through sending their minds into peoples' bodies who were alive at the time and get trapped in the bodies of the two crucified thieves. * In one of the episodes of Philip Jos√© Farmer's Riverworld series, Jesus was resurrected in a manner completely different from that depicted in Christian theology. Along with millions of other people from all times and places in history, he was given a new, completely human, life along the banks of a mysterious long river on another planet. In this depiction, the revived Jesus is a Jew who never intended to found a new religion, and when encountering Christians from later ages he does not recognize himself in the Divine Jesus which they believe in. He is delighted to encounter an Israelite woman who took part in the Exodus from Egypt and whose eye-witness account of Moses and Aharon is substantially different from that in the Bible. Eventually Jesus is tortured to death by a rabidly antisemitic Medieval German Baron, who angrily rejects the very idea that this Jew might be Jesus. Before dying again, Jesus cries out: \\"Father, they do know what they are doing!\\"Published in \\"Down in the Black Gang\\" (1971) . * In an episode of Star Trek: The Original Series called \\"Bread and Circuses,\\" an alien planet is depicted as having \\"parallel evolution\\" to that of Earth and at the time of the episode was in a state of \\"20th century Rome.\\" Slaves were forced to fight gladiator style on a television set designed like ancient Rome that was broadcast to the rest of the citizens. However, some of the slaves rebelled when they heard the \\"word of the sun\\" and became \\"sun worshipers.\\" It is revealed at the end of the episode that the rebel slaves were not inspired by the \\"sun\\" but by the \\"son;\\" as in the Son of God. The last few line of the episode is delivered by Captain Kirk and Dr. McCoy where Kirk says \\"Caesar and Christ; they had them both. And the word is spreading only now\\" and McCoy says \\"a philosophy of total love and total brotherhood.\\" Another Son of God In the alternate history timeline of Harry Turtledove's In High Places, in which the Black Plague was much worse than in our history, there appeared in the city of Avignon at that time of crisis a charismatic religious leader named Henri, claiming to be \\"The Second Son of God\\". He was executed as a heretic. However, on the day after his execution, the church where the Pope and the King of France were worshiping collapsed, killing both of them. This was taken as an act of Divine Retribution and a proof of Henri's claim. Therefore, the worship of Henri as the Second Son of God was officially taken up by the Catholic Church. The life of Henri was described in \\"The Final Testament\\", added to the New Testament (with the name implying that the Church would not welcome any Third Son); churches were henceforward built with two towers, standing for Jesus and Henri; since Henri was broken on a wheel, the Wheel became the symbol of Christianity instead of the Cross; and Avignon remained the permanent seat of the Papacy and became a holy city, with pilgrims flocking to the locations associated with Henri's life and martyrdom. In later times, Christians tended in times of crisis to call on Henri rather than on Jesus. This upheaval in Christian theology had the effect of deepening the hostility between Christianity and Islam. The Muslims - grown very powerful due to the Black Plague devastating Europe - respected Jesus as a Prophet, but refused to accord any such status to Henri. * The Stephen Baxter story \\"The Lingering Joy\\", a sequel to Poul Anderson's The Long Remembering Published in Multiverse: Exploring Poul Anderson's Worlds, ed. Greg bear and Gardner Dozois, Subterranean Press, Boston, 2014, depicts a world on the brink of destruction in nuclear war. A young woman, the story's protagonist, embarks on a kind of \\"mental time travel\\", enabling her to experience the life of a Prehistoric ancestress. Her main motivation is religious: to find out whether the Incarnation of Jesus was a single and unique event, or if God had before incarnated among the Neanderthals, to bring salvation to them, too. She experiences the life of a remote ancestress, a rebellious young Cro-Magnon woman who seeks to prove that she can be the equal of her tribe's male hunters. But while in courage and skill she is fully their equal, she cannot match the male hunters' ruthless cruelty. When visiting the last remaining enclave of the Goblins (Neanderthals), on the verge of final extinction, she cannot help feeling empathy and compassion for a male Goblin whose mate was raped and murdered by a male of her own tribe. And then she encounters the miraculous baby who was born to the doomed Goblins, his birth heralded by a strange new star which blazed in the sky, tens of thousands of years before the Star of Bethlehem. * In the post-apocalyptic world depicted in Edgar Pangborn's novel Davy, the Holy Murkan Church - holding sway over a quasi-medieval culture which had grown in what had been the northeastern US - preaches veneration of Abraham, a Divine Being who was incarnated in human form and underwent martyrdom at what had been Newburgh, New York and became the Holy City of Nuber. Under this new dispensation, Jesus Christ was downgraded to the status of an earlier Prophet who prophesied the Coming of Abraham. Daughter of God In James Morrow's novel Only Begotten Daughter, Julie Katz is the new Messiah, the daughter of God, spontaneously conceived from a sperm bank donation by her father, Murray Katz, through \\"inverse parthenogenesis\\". Julie struggles with her messianic powers, the mind games of Satan, being hunted by fundamentalists, and the silence of her mother, God. This novel precedes Morrow's Godhead Trilogy. *In Poul Anderson's story The Longest Voyage, humans marooned on a faraway planet eventually create a society similar to Elizabethan England, except that their Monotheistic religion is focused on veneration for a Daughter of God rather than a Son. They believe that Paradise is located in the Heavens directly above the place where She lived while She was in the World, and that those who venerate Her and live a righteous life as She coomanded would ultimately get to Paradise. By the end of the story it is revealed that humans on this world are descended from the crew of a crashed interstellar ship, the Daughter of God being evidently a mytholigized memory of the ship's captain or of a woman leader who rallied the survivors to adapt to living in their new environment. Judaism I, Gezheh by Clifford Meth, presents a futuristic universe where the proselytizing Hasidic sect Chabad-Lubavitch have gained influence over many alien worlds * Philip Jose Farmer's 1979 novel Jesus on Mars has terran marsnauts discover a civilization on Mars composed of the technologically superior Krsh and a population of human beings descended from people picked up from earth centuries before. The Krsh and humans now form one community who practice a form of Judaism, having been converted by Matthias, the disciple who replaced Judas as one of the original Twelve. They acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Messiah, God's adopted Son, but not as Deity, causing all sorts of issues for the terran crew (which comprises a nominal Baptist, a liberal Jew and Muslim, and an atheist) who come face to face with a figure claiming to be Christ himself...

To her husband, Glen Runciter, she describes this rebirth as beginning by a dissolution of personality, an intermingling and \\"growing together\\" of different personalities in half-life, and tells him that she keeps dreaming of a \\"smoky red light.\\" He reminds her that the Bardo Th√∂dol (Tibetan Book of the Dead) indicates that the smoky red light is a \\"bad womb\\"‚Äîa \\"humiliating, low sort of womb\\"‚Äîand to be avoided (pp. 12‚Äì13). * The Vitanuls (1967) by John Brunner extrapolates the implications of a Hindu cosmology of rebirth in a world that has conquered death.

It's the remake of the hollywood movie \\" Bad Boys (1995 film)\\"released in 1995, directed by Michael Bay starring Will Smith and Matin Lawrence. Bade Miyan Chote Miyan was Bachchan's first box office hit since his comeback to Bollywood after a hiatus of few years, and its muharat shot was done by Bachchan's daughter Shweta Nanda on 22 December 1998. Produced on a budget of , Bade Miyan Chote Miyan was theatrically released on 16 October 1998 alongside Karan Johar's Kuch Kuch Hota Hai; though the latter emerged as the biggest success of the year, it became the second biggest hit in the list and went on to gross over worldwide. Synopsis A woman Neha (Ramya Krishnan) witnesses the murder of a friend of her named Madhu (Divya Dutta) by a notorious smuggler Zorawar (Paresh Rawal) but she skips while being chased by Zorawar's goons and ends up in the secure custody of police inspector Arjun Singh (Amitabh Bachchan), a friend of police inspector Pyare Mohan (Govinda). In reality, Neha, unaware of their identities, believes Arjun to be \\"Pyare\\", about whom she was agreeably apprised of by Madhu, and so, Arjun has to impersonate Pyare, giving rise to hilarious situations. Concurrently, Pyare flirts with Seema (Raveena Tandon) - Arjun's sister. Everything could have been passable for the two cops if two lookalikes of the cops, by the nicknames \\"Bade Miyan\\" (Amitabh Bachchan) and \\"Chote Miyan\\" (Govinda) had not been a cause of concern for them because of the misdeeds they commit leading to Arjun and Pyare being accused as the miscreants every time. With background scores of the songs (especially \\"Bade Miyan Toh Bade Miyan\\") that stir the listeners, the movie advances through scenes of thrill and amusement. Plot Arjun Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) and Pyare Mohan (Govinda) are police inspectors. They share a friendly bond. Arjun's sister, Seema (Raveena Tandon), is in love with Pyare. Arjun has no female companion and some petty comments are made about his age. Zorawar (Paresh Rawal) runs a business smuggling arms and diamonds, under a cover of being a statue maker. Once, in a hotel, he discovers that he is being spied upon and along with the cop spying on him, he gets rid of Madhu (Divya Dutta), an eyewitness. Madhu's friend, Neha (Ramya Krishnan), witnesses Madhu's murder. Scared, and with the gangsters after her, she calls the police station and asks for Pyare, but since he is not there, Arjun is asked to go to her, and masquerade as Pyare, who had been described as a very good person to Neha by her dead friend. In a considerable amount of confusion, he takes her to Pyare's house and even ges to the extent of asking Pyare to masquerade as Arjun. Two petty thieves, Bade Miyan (Amitabh Bachchan) and Chote Miyan (Govinda), who are look-alikes of Arjun and Pyare respectively, arrive in town. Confusion ensue when every crime the crooks commit are blamed on Arjun and Pyare. Things goes further downhill when Shyamlal (Anupam Kher), the police commissioner, is also thrashed by the doubles. Arjun and Pyare are blamed for stealing a diamond from a bank and messing up security operation of Madhuri Dixit (herself). Even Seema and Neha mistake Bade and Chote for Arjun and Pyare. Arjun and Pyare further land in trouble when Zorawar kidnaps Seema and asks for the diamond and Neha in return. Arjun and Pyare, who have been arrested, are saved by the arrival of Bade and Chote, who confuse their acts of theft and conning, and promise to get Neha and Seema back. Bade and Chote arrive at Zorawar's hideout and stall them while Arjun and Pyare come with police force and everyone at the hideout is arrested. The crooks leave after apologising to Neha and Seema for the confusion. However, some of Zorawar's men hijack the police van which is taking Zorawar and his associates to jail. They are stopped on the way by Bade and Chote, asking for a lift. The latter realises who really are in the van and proceed to badly thrash Zorawar and his men and return him to jail. Arjun and Pyare are criticised for their mistake regarding the hijacking of the van and the two crooks are given a job in the police force by the commissioner himself. The film ends with Arjun and Pyare ending up being demoted to the post of traffic police officers and Bade and Chote taking their place as police inspectors.

Similar to Shah's prior compositions for films like Mohra and Gupt that became quite popular, the album noticeably showed his offbeat mode of music yielding the tuneful numbers like the hit title track \\"Bade Miyan Chote Miyan\\", the hit zippy bhangra number \\"Makhna\\" and the groovy \\"Kisi Disco Mein Jaayein\\".

Croatia formally declared independence during his term, on 25 June 1991. Following his brief term as Prime Minister, he served as the first Speaker of the Chamber of Counties, the upper house of the Croatian Parliament, from 1993 until 1994.  Youth and World War II  Manoliƒá was born in Kalinovac near ƒêurƒëevac. When he was 18, he joined the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia (SKOJ). He was vice president of the Association of Workers' Unions (URS) for the tanning industry. He was accepted into the Communist Party of Croatia when he was 19. In 1940 he was appointed Secretary of the Municipal Committee of SKOJ for Nova Gradi≈°ka and was named member of the Regional Committee of the Communist Party. After the outbreak of the World War II in Yugoslavia, Manoliƒá was involved in illegal party activity in Nova Gradi≈°ka. He was arrested by the Usta≈°e authorities in May 1941, along with twelve members of the Communist Party and SKOJ, for multiplying and sharing the Communist Party leaflets. At first, he was imprisoned in Nova Gradi≈°ka, but was later transferred to Slavonska Po≈æega. Two of the party members were sentenced to death, but were later pardoned and their sentences were reduced to two and three years in prison, respectively. The rest were released. After his release, Manoliƒá went to Zagreb, where he agitated for the Yugoslav Partisans. He remained in Zagreb until October 1942, when he moved to the territory under the partisan control. As a party agitator, he traveled across Croatia. With dismissal of Andrija Hebrang in 1944, the whole leadership of SKOJ was dismissed as well, including Manoliƒá, who was Organisational Secretary. After his dismissal, the Party sent him to Bjelovar. In March 1944, Manoliƒá became Member of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia for Bjelovar, and was later named Organisational Secretary. In October 1944, he was named Director of OZNA 2 in Bjelovar, the communist police founded in May 1944. OZNA 2's jurisdiction were internal affairs, while OZNA 1's jurisdiction was external security and OZNA 3 served within the military. Under pressure from the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia, the Yugoslav Partisans left Bjelovar, and returned again on 5 May 1945. His duty, from that point on, was, as Manoliƒá said, to \\"clear the terrain from the remaining Usta≈°e and adversary occupational forces\\". His jurisdiction was Municipality of Bjelovar, which then included Koprivnica, Kri≈æevci, ƒêurƒëevac, Vrbovec, ƒåazma and Ivaniƒá-Grad.  Communist era  After the war, in spring of 1946, Manoliƒá was dismissed as Chief of OZNA 2 for Bjelovar, and in autumn of the same year, he was sent to be educated at the Military-Political School in Belgrade. The school was organised according to the Soviet model, and was part of the educational system of the Yugoslav People's Army. At the end of 1947, Manoliƒá returned to Zagreb, and was named the Chief of the Department for Staff of the State Security Administration of PR Croatia. On 1 August 1948, Manoliƒá was named the Chief of Department for Execution of Criminal Sentences of the Secretariat of Internal Affairs in Zagreb. During that time, he imprisoned Archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac. In 1948 he became a chief for prisons for political prisoners and remained in this office until 1963. In 1960, Manoliƒá gained a law degree from the Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb. In 1965 he was elected to the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Croatia. As a Member of Parliament, Manoliƒá was Member of the Constitutional Commission, President of the Legislative-Legal Commission and President of the Organisational-Political Committee. He was reelected as an MP in 1965. In the aftermath of the Croatian Spring in 1972, Manoliƒá was relieved of all duties and sent into retirement.  Democratic changes and War in Croatia  He was one of the founders of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), participating at its founding assembly in Jarun, Zagreb. Manoliƒá was Franjo Tuƒëman's closest associates. Soon, he was named Vice President of the Presidency of the SR Croatia. Between 24 August 1990 and 17 July 1991, he was Prime Minister of Croatia, having succeeded Stjepan Mesiƒá in the post. His Chief of Staff was Tomislav Karamarko, the future chairman of the HDZ and Deputy Prime Minister under Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá. On 25 June 1991, the Croatian Parliament voted for Croatia to secede from SFR Yugoslavia and declared it an independent country. Manoliƒá was succeeded by Franjo Greguriƒá in July 1991. When Manoliƒá left the office on 17 July 1991 Croatian forces  police and nascent military  were involved in full-scale war with Krajina rebels, who were backed by the Yugoslav federal army. He took another, even more important post as the head of Constitutional Order Protection Office (Ured za za≈°titu ustavnog poretka), a body that would coordinate and supervise all Croatian security services. There he built Tuƒëman's security apparatus, relying mostly on the old cadre from UDBA and other sections of the Communist-era security apparatus. Despite the nature of his work, he remained very much in the public spotlight. In his interviews and statements he gradually gained a reputation of being a moderate. His enormous power, moderate views and Partisan past made him very unpopular among the rank and file of the HDZ party and brought him into conflict with Gojko ≈†u≈°ak, the powerful Minister of Defence, who led a hard-line nationalist faction. In 1993 Manoliƒá was replaced from his post and elected as Speaker of the Chamber of Counties of Croatia (to 1994). Many saw this as his demotion and fall from Tuƒëman's favor. One year later Manoliƒá and Mesiƒá tried to organise a mass defection of HDZ members of Sabor and thus deprive Franjo Tuƒëman of parliamentary majority. They failed and later, together with other HDZ dissidents, created a new party called Croatian Independent Democrats (HND), of which Manoliƒá was the president in 1995. Manoliƒá's attempt to take power on national level failed, but his supporters in the Zagreb County Assembly succeeded in replacing HDZ administration. This led Tuƒëman to introduce new legislation, merging Zagreb County and the City of Zagreb and calling for new elections, which ultimately resulted in the Zagreb Crisis. Those elections coincided with the 1995 parliamentary elections, during which HND fared badly, failing to enter Sabor. Since that time, Manoliƒá has been retired from active politics. His autobiography, Politika i domovina ‚Äì Moja borba za suverenu i socijalnu Hrvatsku (Politics and homeland - My fight for a sovereign and social Croatia), was published in 2015. Personal life In 1945, Manoliƒá married his first wife, Marija Eker (1921 ‚Äì 15 April 2003). On 30 April 2016, Manoliƒá married his second wife, Mirjana Ribariƒá (5 March 1956 ‚Äì‚Å† 18 August 2020),https://direktno.hr/zivot/shrvani-manolic-primio-vijest-o-smrti-svoje- supruge-jedino-me-tjesi-da-se-vise-nece-muciti-strasno-g-204430/ who is 36 years his junior.http://www.izbori.hr/2003Sabor/kandidatura/IJ06/IJ06-20.htm =Longevity= Manoliƒá is the oldest living former Croatian Prime Minister and the longest-lived person to have ever held the office. His advanced age has earned him notoriety both on social media and in the press. Namely, he was found to be one of the oldest holders of a valid driver's license in Croatia and also became allegedly the first Croat to have undergone a sequencing of his genome. There is also a notable satirical Facebook page dedicated to his longevity with the title Jo≈æa Manoliƒá je nad≈æivio (Josip Manoliƒá has outlived). He turned 100 on 22 March 2020.

It forms a superspecies with the Taiwan blue magpie and the red-billed blue magpie. The species ranges across the northern parts of the Indian Subcontinent including the lower Himalayas, with a disjunct population in Vietnam. Description Length , including tail of about . Sexes alike. Head, neck, and breast black, with a white patch on the nape; remainder of lower plumage white, faintly tinged with lilac; whole upper plumage purplish-blue, brighter on the wings and tail; flight-feathers tipped with white, the outermost edged with the same; tail long and graduated, the feathers blue, broadly tipped with white, all except the very long central pair having a band of black in front of the white Distribution The yellow-billed blue magpie is found throughout the Himalayas from Hazara to the Brahmaputra. It is divided into two races. Of these, U. f. cucullata is the better known and is found from the Western boundary of the range to Western Nepal, being a common species about most of the hill stations of the Western Himalayas, breeding in a zone from . The typical form is found from Eastern Nepal eastwards and differs in that the under parts have a darker lilac tinge; its zone is slightly higher than that of the Western form, as it seldom occurs as low as . A resident species, but during the winter months it usually deserts the higher parts of its summer zone. From Simla eastwards, the closely allied red-billed blue magpie (Urocissa erythroryncha) is often found in the same areas as the yellow-billed species; it is particularly common about Mussoorie, Tehri-Garhwal, -Kumaon, and in Nepal, and may be easily distinguished by its red beak and the greater extent of the white nape-patch. Behaviour The blue magpies are, as may be judged from their handsome tails, essentially arboreal birds; though, while they are most usually to be met with in heavy jungle areas, they also venture out into the trees amongst cultivation, and at times on to bare mountain sides at high elevations. They frequently feed on the ground and then adopt a curious hopping gait, with the tail held high to prevent it coming into contact with the ground. They live in parties of seven or eight birds and are very partial to particular localities, so that once a party has taken up its abode in any particular nullah or patch of forest it will generally be found there. They are very active, flying incessantly from bough to bough and not hesitating to launch high into the air when flying from ridge to ridge; a party of these bird crossing a nullah out of gunshot above one's head is a curious sight, with their long tails waving in the air and the light shining through the feathers. The flight is rather slow, laboured, and undulating once the bird comes into the open. The food consists of small mammals, the eggs and young of other birds, insects, and wild fruits and berries of various kinds. This bird is very noisy; the ordinary call is harsh and grating, but it has a wide variety of notes, some of which are melodious enough. =Nesting= The nest is built in a fork of a tree, usually of moderate size but with dense foliage, and is difficult to find. It is a rather large and roughly constructed cup of sticks with a lining of fine grass, roots and fibres. The clutch consists of three or four eggs. The base-colour varies from a pale, dingy yellowish-stone colour to a darkish rather reddish-stone colour, and there is very occasionally a faint greenish tinge. The markings consist of small specks, blotches, streaks, and mottlings of various shades of brown, sienna 1 or purple, and they generally tend to collect in a cap or zone about the broad end of the egg.

He is also heir to the headship of the House of Austria-Este, a cadet branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and is sixth in line to the throne of Belgium. Birth and family Amedeo was born on 21 February 1986 at the Saint-Luc University Hospital in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, Belgium, as the first child and elder son of Lorenz, Archduke of Austria-Este, and Princess Astrid of Belgium. He bears the same given name as his paternal great-grandfather, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta. His godparents are his maternal uncle King Philippe and grandmother Queen Paola of Belgium. Amedeo himself is godfather to his cousin, Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant. Amedeo has one younger brother, Joachim (b. 1991), and three younger sisters: Maria Laura (b. 1988), Luisa Maria (b. 1995) and Laetitia Maria (b. 2003). He was baptised and married by the archbishop of Mechelen, Cardinal Danneels. Education and career Amedeo undertook primary school and the greater part of his secondary education at the Jesuit school Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege (founded 1604) in Brussels, popular with Belgian aristocracy and royalty. He finished his secondary education at Sevenoaks School in Kent, England, between 2001 and 2004. He then spent a year in Belgium's Royal Military Academy. In September 2005, he began studies at the London School of Economics, where he graduated in 2008 with a BSc degree in Management, and took a sabbatical before entering professional life. From July 2009 to June 2012, Amedeo worked for Deloitte in New York City, first as a business analyst from July 2009 to June 2011, then as a management consultant in strategy and operations from July 2011 to June 2012. He then worked as a research analyst intern at Accumulus Capital Management, LLC from August through December 2012. During 2013 and 2014, Amedeo resumed his studies, obtaining an MBA degree at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University. He subsequently returned to Belgium, where he worked for McKinsey & Company in Brussels from September 2014 to September 2016. In January 2017, he began working at the Gutzwiller private bank in Basel, where his father is a partner. Marriage  On 15 February 2014, the Belgian Royal Court announced the engagement of Prince Amedeo to an Italian journalist, Nobile Elisabetta \\"Lili\\" Maria Rosboch von Wolkenstein. Announcement of the engagement. Amedeo and Elisabetta both descend from Don Giuseppe Tiberio Ruffo di Calabria-Santapau, 2nd Prince of Palazzolo, Count of Sinopoli (1627‚Äì1683), while through German princely dynasties their most recent common ancestor is Franz Albrecht I, Prince of Oettingen-Spielberg (1663‚Äì1737).vtm.

In 1993, his maternal grandfather acceded to the throne as King Albert II and he became third in Belgium's line of succession, following his uncle Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant, and his mother. Upon Philippe's marriage in 1999, the prospect of Amedeo inheriting the throne substantially diminished, and the birth of a daughter and dynastic heir to Philippe in 2001 dropped his place in the order of succession down to fourth and eventually to seventh, following the birth of Philippe's other children. The abdication on 21 July 2013 of his grandfather King Albert II promoted him to sixth in line to the throne. Although an announcement of Amedeo's engagement was published on the Royal Family's website, no dynastic authorisation for his marriage was published prior to his wedding, as foreseen in Article 85 of the Belgian Constitution. Speculation in the media included a commentator on the military parade for La Une who, on 21 July 2014 (Belgian National Day), alleged that no royal authorisation was announced because the prince intentionally chose not to request permission to marry, and therefore Amedeo was no longer deemed in the line of succession. In November 2015, a royal decree expressing King Philippe's retroactive permission for the marriage was gazetted in the Moniteur Belge.http://fr.metrotime.be/2015/11/24/news/le-prince-amedeo- reintegre-lordre-de-succession-au-troneroyal decree of 12 November 2015.

The ruling was issued in regard to pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally. Since the 1880s, baseball owners had included a paragraph described as the reserve clause in every player contract. The paragraph as written allowed teams to renew a contract for a period of one year following the end of a signed contract. Owners asserted and players assumed that contract language effectively meant that a player could be \\"reserved,\\" by a ballclub's unilateral contract renewal, year after year in perpetuity by the team that had signed the player. That eliminated all market competition and kept salaries relatively low. In 1975, Messersmith of the Los Angeles Dodgers and McNally of the Montreal Expos had had their 1974 contracts automatically renewed by their teams on the basis of this reserve clause. Since neither signed a contract during that option year, both insisted that they were free to sign with other teams the following season. The owners disagreed, arguing that under the reserve clause the one- year contracts were perpetually renewed. The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) filed notices of grievance on behalf of both players on October 7, 1975. Eventually hearings were held on November 21, 24 and December 1, 1975 before an Arbitration Panel composed of MLB Player Relations Committee chief negotiator John Gaherin, MLBPA Executive Director Marvin Miller and Seitz, the Chairman and Impartial Arbitrator agreed upon by both opposing parties. Seitz ruled in favor of Messersmith and McNally on December 23, 1975, declaring:Kansas City Royals Baseball Corp. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass'n, 409 F. Supp. 233, 261 (W.D. Mo. 1976) aff'd, 532 F.2d 615 (8th Cir. 1976) - Leagle, Inc. Seitz's Opinion further stated: In essence, the players were free to bargain with other teams because organized baseball could maintain a player's services for only one year after expiration of the previous contract. According to Gaherin, Seitz indicated soon after he heard arguments from both sides that he was leaning toward ruling for the players. MLB appealed the decision to the United States district court for Western Missouri, but Seitz's ruling was upheld on February 3, 1976 by Judge John Watkins Oliver, and later by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. After all appeals were exhausted, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association signed a new agreement in 1976 allowing players with six years experience to become free agents.

The sister product to Rag√∫, known as Raguletto, is produced in Oceania, Finland, and South Korea. Raguletto is sold in Oceania by Simplot and in Finland by Continental Foods. Overview The Rag√∫ brand was first sold in 1937 and in 2014 was the best selling U.S. brand of pasta sauce. Rag√∫ was acquired by the Lipton and Bestfoods companies before merging with the Unilever portfolio, prior to its sale to Mizkan. The Rag√∫ pasta sauce line consists of smooth Old World Style sauces, Chunky sauces, bold Robusto! sauces, as well as organic and light pasta sauces. While most well known for selling jar packaged pasta sauce, Rag√∫ also purveys a pizza sauce and an Alfredo sauce. Current advertising highlights the natural ingredients and \\"full serving of veggies\\" found in the sauce. Cooked tomato foods, including Rag√∫, are highlighted as containing the antioxidant lycopene, which is claimed to be a cancer fighting agent. As of 2015, the advertising campaign refers to the creation of Rag√∫ by Assunta Cantisano (see below: \\"History\\") with the phrase \\"Simmered in Tradition.\\" Spelling Although the name is spelled with an accent like the Italian sauce, rag√π, the brand name Rag√∫ is spelled with an acute accent, while the Italian word rag√π (an Italian sauce typically used for dressing pasta) is spelled with a grave accent. History Rag√∫ had its origins in Rochester, New York, in 1937. Assunta Cantisano and her husband Giovanni founded the Ragu Packing Company in their home in Rochester, New York, in 1937, making spaghetti sauce in their basement and selling it on their front porch. They later expanded to an entire factory. In 1969, the Ragu name was sold to Chesebrough-Pond's, which in turn was acquired by Unilever in 1987. The facility in Rochester still manufactured products under the Cantisano name brand. Some of the original facility still exists and produces products for other labels (including Newman's Own) as private label foods. The Cantisano family left to create Cantisano Foods (now LiDestri Foods), and invented the Francesco Rinaldi brand of pasta sauce. The quotations \\"As I got older, I got better\\" and \\"Ciao, Francesco Rinaldi\\" have gained popularity since their use in commercials for Francesco Rinaldi. In August 2020, Mizkan announced that they were removing Rag√∫ from the Canadian market.

Visualisation for Semantic Information Systems. p.32 This type of diagram was developed in 1972 by Isaac Nassi and Ben Shneiderman who were both graduate students at Stony Brook University.A short history of structured flowcharts (Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams). Webdoc draft: May 27, 2003. (Source) These diagrams are also called structograms,Rolf Isermann (1988).

Overview  Following a top-down design, the problem at hand is reduced into smaller and smaller subproblems, until only simple statements and control flow constructs remain. Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams reflect this top-down decomposition in a straightforward way, using nested boxes to represent subproblems. Consistent with the philosophy of structured programming, Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams have no representation for a GOTO statement. Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams are only rarely used for formal programming. Their abstraction level is close to structured program code and modifications require the whole diagram to be redrawn, but graphic editors removed that limitation. They clarify algorithms and high-level designs, which make them useful in teaching. They were included in Microsoft Visio and dozens of other software tools, such as the German EasyCode. In Germany, Nassi- Shneiderman diagrams were standardised in 1985 as DIN 66261.Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung e. V.

Diagrams  Process blocks: the process block represents the simplest of steps and requires no analysis. When a process block is encountered, the action inside the block is performed and we move onto the next block. Process blocks Branching blocks: there are two types of branching blocks. First is the simple True/False or Yes/No branching block which offers the program two paths to take depending on whether or not a condition has been fulfilled. These blocks can be used as a looping procedure stopping the program from continuing until a condition has been fulfilled. True/False branching blocks The second type of branching block is a multiple branching block. This block is used when a select case is needed in a program. The block usually contains a question or select case. The block provides the program with an array of choices and is often used in conjunction with sub process blocks to save space. Multiple branching blocks Testing loops: this block allows the program to loop one or a set of processes until a particular condition is fulfilled. The process blocks covered by each loop are subset with a side-bar extending out from the condition. There are two main types of testing loops, test first and test last blocks. The only difference between the two is the order in which the steps involved are completed. In the test first situation, when the program encounters the block it tests to see if the condition is fulfilled, then, if it is not completes the process blocks and then loops back. The test is performed again and, if the condition is still unfulfilled, it processes again. If at any stage the condition is fulfilled the program skips the process blocks and continues onto the next block. Test first loop block The test last block is simply reversed, the process blocks are completed before the test is performed. The test last loop allows for the process blocks to be performed at least once before the first test. Test last loop block Concurrent execution can be drawn like this: parallel processing  See also Drakon- chart *Flowchart *Pseudocode  Publications  Nassi, I.; Shneiderman, B.: Flowchart techniques for structured programming, SIGPLAN Notices XII, August 1973.

It was influenced by the traditional cuisine of its neighbours and it influenced them as well. The origins of traditional Slovak cuisine can be traced to times when the majority of the population lived self-sufficiently in villages, with very limited food imports and exports and with no modern means of food preservation or processing. This gave rise to a cuisine heavily dependent on a number of staple foods that could stand the hot summers and cold winters. These included wheat, potatoes, milk and milk products, pork meat, sauerkraut and onion. To a lesser degree beef, poultry, lamb and goat, eggs, a few other local vegetables, fruit and wild mushrooms were traditionally eaten. All these were usually produced and processed by families themselves with some local trade at the country markets. Wheat was ground, and bread, dumplings and noodles were made from it. Potatoes were mostly boiled or processed into potato dough. Milk was processed into a wide range of products such as butter, cream, sour cream, buttermilk, and various types of cheese etc. Typical pork products include sausages, smoked bacon, and lard. Spices were not widely used, and animal fats and butter were used instead of cooking oils. Main beverages included fresh and sour milk, and beer. Contemporary Slovak cuisine is widely influenced by various world cuisines and uses many different ingredients, spices and industrially processed foods.

Among poultry, chicken is most common, although duck, goose, and turkey are also well established. Game meats, especially boar, rabbit, and venison, are also widely available throughout the year. Lamb and goat are also available, but for the most part are not very popular. The consumption of horse meat is generally frowned upon. Grilled meat is not common in Slovakia. Instead, meat is either breaded and fried in oil (schnitzel), or cooked and served in sauce. Hungarian influences in Slovak cuisine can be seen in popular stews and goulashes. However, these have been given Slovak touches. Chicken paprikash is typically served with halu≈°ky and Hungarian goulash (spicy beef stew) is served with slices of a large bread- like steamed dumpling.

In Lincolnshire, sock dyke was formerly a frequently found form of the expression.Wheeler, W.H. A History of the Fens of South Lincolnshire (1896). facsimile edn. Paul Watkins, Stamford. (1990) . Appendix IV. In some parts of the world, the embankment would be called a levee. The soak is the ground water in the peat or silt of the fenland, though the term is often used to mean water table.See Oxford English Dictionary. . See soak, substantive, 2. In The Fens, water from the surrounding higher land is carried across the land which lies below high tide level, in embanked rivers. In this way, the need for pumping is reduced. However, the banks are never completely waterproof so that even in an otherwise thoroughly drained fen, the water table near the river bank would be high, reducing the value of the land and weakening the bank. The leaky condition of the river embankments usually arose from a difficulty in finding good materials for their construction and from the piecemeal way in which the structures accumulated as the ground shrank or repairs were needed. The difficulty is overcome by cutting a fairly small ditch, perhaps twenty or thirty metres from the bank, so that it collects the ground water and feeds it to a pump. Counter drain Counter drain is another term for much the same thing though in this case, it may have been designed also to deal with water overflowing the river bank. The counter drain would therefore need to be bigger than the soak dike. Counter drain has tended to supersede the other term, particularly in its use as a proper name. The Counter Drain in Deeping Fen is a good example, where the land between it and the bank of the River Glen was designed as a wash. In other words, the land between the river and the outer bank of the counter drain was originally intended to act as a reservoir in the event of an overflow from the river.Wheeler p120 Notes and references Land management Dikes ","title":"Soak dike"},{"id":"1834488","text":"FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Ridge FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains ( ; ) are the highest mountains of the Southern Carpathians, in Romania.

Glacier lakes include B√¢lea (2034 m, 46,508 m2, 11.35 m deep), the largest. The highest lake is in the HƒÉrtopul Leaotei glacial valley. The deepest glacial lake is Podragu (2140 m, 28,550 m2 15.5 m deep). Other lakes: Urlea (2170 m, 20,150 m2), Capra (2230 m, 18,340 m2).

The TransfƒÉgƒÉrƒÉ»ôan runs across the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô range. It is generally open only between June and September, due to unfavorable weather conditions for the rest of the year. The FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains are a very popular hiking, trekking and skiing destination in Romania.

At the root of the fire is under »òerbota several meters of steel cable handrail, on the other part there are no artificial enhancements.  Conflicts  A decision to designate the mountains as a national park occurred in 2016, and has proven controversial with local people seeking to protect access to timber and forest products. In reality, the range has complex land tenure arrangements, so only a portion could be so designated initially, aided by private investment. There are also plans to develop a ski resort, opposed by conservationists but supported by many residents of the surrounding towns, who seek better livelihood and economic opportunities.https://www.romania- insider.com/romanias-fagaras-mountains-declared-national-park Marie Louise Aastrup.2020.

It was built for a Japanese bank and then sold on to accommodate staff of the Department of Health who were moved out of Alexander Fleming House. The project architect was Paul Cayford. Its address is 80 London Road SE1 6LH, next to the Bakerloo line entrance to Elephant & Castle tube station. It was opened by Virginia Bottomley, who was then Secretary of State for Health, on 15 February 1993. Its floor area is . From outside, the two outstanding characteristics are the dark brown marble cladding and the impressive entranceway. Inside, there is a large glass-topped central atrium, with the second to sixth floors having balconies. When the Information Centre for Health and Social Care was created on April 1, 2005 its London office was in Skipton House. It has since moved to Leeds, West Yorkshire. Furthermore, during 2005 substantial numbers of Department of Health staff were moved in from nearby Eileen House and Hannibal House where those leases had expired. In 2011 a further tranche of Department of Health staff were moved in from nearby New Kings Beam House. It is the headquarters of the NHS Counter Fraud Authority. Image:Skipton_House_side.jpgThe marble cladding Redevelopment plans Plans were approved in 2016 to demolish Skipton House as well as the adjacent hostel and London South Bank University Perry Library to make way for a mixed-use development designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill containing high-end flats, offices and restaurants. The plans were subsequently withdrawn due to a lack of agreement between the landowners and in 2019 a new planning application was submitted to re-clad and add six more storeys to the existing building.The application was referred back to Southwark London Borough Council by the Greater London Authority on the basis that it \\"does not comply with the London Plan and the draft London Plan\\". Although the GLA suggested possible remedies including contributing towards the cost of a new Elephant and Castle Northern line London Underground station, the developer has not submitted an updated plan.

While laughter is popularly thought of as a pleasure response, in tickle torture, the one being tickled may laugh whether or not they find the experience pleasant. In a tickling situation, laughter can indicate a panic reflex rather than a pleasure response. Tickle torture may be a consensual activity or one that is forced, depending on the circumstances. In a consensual form, tickle torture may be part of a mutually fulfilling, physically-intimate act between partners. However, forced tickle torture can cause real physical and mental distress in a victim, which is why it has been used as an interrogation method or to simply show dominance over another person. In history Chinese tickle torture is an ancient form of torture practiced by the Chinese, in particular the courts of the Han Dynasty. Chinese tickle torture was a punishment for nobility since it left no marks and a victim could recover relatively easily and quickly. Josef Kohout, a man persecuted in the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp during World War II, witnessed Nazi prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate, followed by various other tortures which resulted in his death. This incident is described in Heinz Heger's book The Men With The Pink Triangle: \\"The first game that the SS sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the armpits, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other. Then he could not restrain himself and finally he broke out in a high-pitched laughter that very soon turned into a cry of pain.\\"Heger, Heinz. The Men With the Pink Triangle. Boston: Alyson Publications, 1980. An article in the British Medical Journal about European tortures describes a method of tickle torture in which a goat was compelled to lick the victim's feet because they had been dipped in salt water. Once the goat had licked the salt off, the victim's feet would be dipped in the salt water again and the process would repeat itself. However, it remains unclear if this method was ever used in practice as it is only described in the 1502 Tractatus de indiciis et tortura by the Italian jurist and monk Franciscus Brunus de San Severino - a treatise that actually cautioned against torture in general - and while it seems clear that Franciscus Brunus had not made up this practice, the issue is left open whether the inclusion in the treatise is based on hearsay, (reliable) eye- witness accounts or personal experience. This uncertainty does not preclude this anecdote from being repeated in popular culture, for instance during a 2013 episode of the British satirical quiz show QI. In ancient Japan, those in positions of authority could administer punishments to those convicted of crimes that were beyond the criminal code. This was called shikei, which translates as ‚Äòprivate punishment.‚Äô One such torture was kusuguri-zeme: \\"merciless tickling.\\"Schreiber, Mark. The Dark Side: Infamous Japanese Crimes and Criminals. Japan: Kodansha International, 2001. Page 71 In his book Sibling Abuse, Vernon Wiehe published his research findings regarding 150 adults who were abused by their siblings during childhood. Several reported tickling as a type of physical abuse they experienced, and based on these reports it was revealed that abusive tickling is capable of provoking extreme physiological reactions in the victim, such as vomiting, incontinence (losing control of bladder), and losing consciousness due to inability to breathe.Wiehe, Vernon. Sibling Abuse: Hidden Physical, Emotional, and Sexual Trauma. New York: Lexington Books, 1990. There is currently no evidence that tickle torture was ever widespread or was practiced by governments. The very small amount of related documentation discovered thus far originates from England and the United States. A 1903 article described an immobilized suicidal patient at the Hudson River State Hospital who was tied to a bed for his own safety. While he lay helpless, the patient's feet were tickled by one of the hospital attendants, Frank A. Sanders. \\"Sanders is said to have confessed that while intoxicated he amused himself by tickling the feet and ribs of Hayes and pulling his nose.\\" Sanders also gave his restrained victim a black eye. Another hospital employee came upon Sanders while he was entertaining himself at his patient's expense, and the criminal was brought before a grand jury. An 1887 article entitled \\"England in Old Times\\" states \\"Gone, too, are the parish stocks, in which offenders against public morality formerly sat imprisoned, with their legs held fast beneath a heavy wooden yoke, while sundry small but fiendish boys improved the occasion by deliberately pulling off their shoes and tickling the soles of their defenseless feet.\\" Other uses and meanings The term tickle torture can apply to many different situations that do not include the aforementioned acts of either sexual gratification or malicious torture. Tickle torture can be an extended act of tickling where the recipient of the tickling would view it as a long time or tickling of an intense nature. This can be due to the length of time they are tickled, the intensity of the tickling or the areas that are being tickled. This can simply be a 30-second tickle applied to the victim's bare feet, which can seem like a much longer time if the victim's feet are very ticklish. While the palm of the hand is far more sensitive to touch, other commonly ticklish areas include the armpits, sides of the torso, neck, knee, midriff, thighs, navel, and the ribs. Many people consider the soles of their feet the most ticklish, due to the many nerve endings located there: this explains why tickling one's feet against their will is the most common example of \\"tickle torture\\". \\"Tickle torture\\" may also have other uses, including the act of tickling a person as a means of humiliating someone, or even an interrogation method. This may not be extreme tickling, but could include prolonged tickling upon a sensitive area until the victim has released the required information. In the former case, it could be used as a way of humiliating a person, as the act of being tickled can produce many sounds and sensations that could be viewed as being embarrassing to the victim. In this way, the tickling can continue to the point where a certain reaction is revealed. This method of \\"humiliating\\" could also incorporate the use of physical restraint or restraint using materials. This would be done to leave a desired area of the body bare and vulnerable to the tickling, in a way that the victim would not be able to remove this area from the tickling, and would have to simply endure. This can also be seen as \\"punishment\\" or \\"payback\\" as the tickler could be using the tickling as retribution from a previous tickling experience or \\"humiliating event\\". Consensual EXXXOTICA New York 2009 In sexual fetishism, tickle torture is an activity between consenting partners. A torture session usually begins with one partner allowing the other to tie them up in a position that exposes bare parts of the body, particularly those that are sensitive to tickling. Though many parts of the human body are deemed ticklish, tickle torture is commonly associated with the tickling of the bare feet or armpits. The bondage methods of the tickling usually follows the same basic methods. The object of the bondage is to render the victim unable to remove themselves from the tickling, as well as rendering the ticklish areas of the victim vulnerable. The victim is usually bound in a sitting or lying position rather than a standing one as to expose the soles of the feet which are often among the areas upon which tickling is inflicted. The restraint of the arms above the head leaves the upper body and underarms susceptible to the tickling. This enables the torturer to use whatever they want, e.g. fingers, tongue, beard, feathers, brush, pine cones, salt sticks, electric toothbrush or a hairbrush. In fiction In VeggieTales's Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen, King Xerxes disposes of criminals by banishing them to the Island of Perpetual Tickling, to which Death, wielding a scythe-sized feather, escorts them. Thus, tickle torture serves here as a family-friendly depiction of capital punishment. The TV series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a recurring character named Don Turtelli whose main form of torture was to take a feather to the soles of the feet of his captives. Tickle torture has become the subject of many fetish/sexual publications. These fictional writings can portray a fantasy of a desirable character, often a celebrity, being restrained and interrogated. These stories are not always sexual, although they are mostly the object of sexual fantasies and dreams. Because of the fantasy element of the plot, the characters are often magical or the circumstances are completely imaginative. In one of the light novels of the Naruto Secret Chronicle series, the shinobi Sai uses tickle torture on an ANBU member he was interrogating, as the man had been taught to withstand traditional torture. The action succeeded in them finding the location of their comrade, Sakura Haruno.

In 1882 the Anglo‚ÄìEgyptian War resulted in Britain acquiring physical control over the Suez Canal and Egypt. France, which had previously dominated the canal and whose investors still controlled the majority of shares in the Suez Canal Company, hoped to weaken British control and attempted to sway European opinion for internationalizing the canal. The two powers compromised by neutralizing the canal through the treaty. Article I, guaranteeing passage to all ships during war and peace, was in tension with Article X, which allowed the Khedive to take measures for \\"the defence of Egypt and the maintenance of public order.\\" The latter clause was used to defend their actions by the British in the Second World War and by Egypt against Israeli shipping after 1948. However, Britain accepted the treaty reluctantly and only with serious reservations: > The delegates of Great Britain, in offering this text as the definitive rule > to secure the free use of the Suez Canal, believe it is their duty to > announce a general reservation as to the applicability of its provisions in > so far as they are incompatible with the transitory and exceptional state in > which Egypt is actually found and so far as they might fetter the liberty of > action of the government during the occupation of Egypt by the British > forces. France accepted the reservation but, in accordance with international law at the time, noted that this made the treaty a \\"technically inoperative\\" \\"academic declaration.\\" The reservation was not removed until the Entente Cordiale between Britain and France, and the convention finally came into force in 1904. The Entente stipulated that the functioning of the international supervisory commission described in article 8 would \\"remain in abeyance.\\" However, for the next forty years, British actions would be largely in the spirit of the abandoned reservation. On 5 August 1914, at the beginning of the First World War, Egypt declared that the canal would be open to ships of all nations, but Britain converted its occupation into a British protectorate and barred canal access to enemy ships. Citing the security of the canal, Britain attempted to maintain its prerogatives in unilateral declarations.Allain, p.54 The signatories comprised all the great European powers in 1888, and the treaty was interpreted as a guaranteed right of passage of all ships through the Suez Canal during war and peace. Subsequent wars and skirmishes passed control of the Canal to various powers, including the United Kingdom, Egypt, Israel, and the United Nations. In 1956 the Egyptian Government nationalized the Suez Canal. On June 5, 1967, during the Six-Day War, Egypt closed and blockaded the canal against Israel. The waterway reopened on June 10, 1975. A multinational observer force (including the United States, Israel, and Egypt) currently oversees the canal, which is owned and maintained by the Suez Canal Authority of the Arab Republic of Egypt. According to the international rules which govern navigation through Suez, Egypt cannot forbid any vessel from passing through the Suez Canal if there is no war between Egypt and that country.

Being accorded the highest military decoration, the Hero of the Soviet Union title, for the skill and courage in commanding a division in the 1939-1940 Finnish campaign, Kirponos is remembered for his leading role in the failed defense of Ukraine during the Battle of Brody, the Battle of Uman, and Kyiv in the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was killed in action by German fire in the defense of Kyiv on 20 September 1941. Early life Kirponos was born in a poor peasant family and worked as a forester. He was conscripted in 1915 and took part in World War I. In 1917 he joined the Red Army, fought in the Russian Civil War, and joined the Bolshevik party in 1918. In 1927 he graduated from the M. V. Frunze Military Academy. After graduation he was chief of staff of the 44th Rifle Division, then chief of the Supreme Soviet of the Tatar Autonomous Republic Kazan Military School from 1934 to 1939. On 21 March 1940, he was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions during the Soviet-Finnish War. He became commander of the Leningrad Military District the same year. World War II In February 1941 he was assigned commander of the Kiev Military District, which was transformed into the Southwestern Front at the beginning of the German-Soviet War. On the night of 21 June 1941, the day before the launch of Operation Barbarossa by the Wehrmacht, Mikhail Kirponos disregarded the strict instruction from Stavka to ignore rumors of the pending invasion the next day and spent the night preparing mission orders for his command. That same night, the unfortunate D. G. Pavlov of the Western Front accepted Stavka's assertion that rumors of war were deception at face value and went to the opera in Minsk. While his front- line units were under the Stavka's general order to treat any German attack as a likely provocation, and not to return fire, just as all other front line units of the Soviet armies of the frontier had been instructed, the armies of the Southwestern Front were alert, and had not been completely stood down. It is possibly because of this wary attitude of Kirponos and his staff that the Southwestern Front was not caught completely flat footed when the Germans attacked. Disposition of forces for the Southwestern Front, and considerable terrain advantages also favored Kirponos in comparison to his counterparts in Byelorussia. In general, his command had more forces to deploy in depth, and von Runstedt's Army Group South only attacked with a single Panzer army, as opposed to two available to Army Group Center. Stavka in fact believed that Kirponos had enough forces under his command to effectively comply with Stavka's General Chief of Staff G. K. Zhukov's \\"Directive No. 3\\", which called for a counterattack by the Southwestern Front with the objective of seizing Lublin in German occupied Poland. Kirponos, and his staff were ambivalent about this ambitious proposal. Shortly thereafter, Zhukov himself showed up at Southwestern Front headquarters at Ternopil with Nikita Khrushchev in tow, to personally direct the operation. The result was the ill-fated attack against the flanks of the 1st Panzer Group that was advancing toward Kyiv between the 5th and 6th armies, known as the Battle of Brody. Severe communications, logistics and coordination problems plagued the operation, and as a consequence, the uncoordinated Mechanized Corps showed up late to their jump- off points in a disorganized fashion, without their complete complement of equipment and entered the battle piecemeal. The fact that Zhukov and Kirponos were at odds about the offensive deepened these problems with Kirponos issuing a general order to cease the offensive on the 27th of June, because he wanted to make his front line shorter, \\"so as to prevent the enemy tank groupings from penetrating into the rear of the 6th and 26th Armies\\", according to H. Baghramyan.* This order was quickly countermanded by Zhukov who ordered the attack resumed, an order that was promptly refused on the \\"personal responsibility\\" of the commander of the 9th Mechanized Corps, Konstantin Rokossovsky, leaving the commander of the 8th Mechanized Corps unaware that he was engaging alone. Despite these difficulties, and the eventual loss of the great majority of the tanks involved in the fight, the German command was taken off guard. Even though in the balance the Southwestern Front did comparatively better than the other Front commands in the frontier battles, and generally maintained organizational cohesion and some operational initiative, Nikita Khrushchev noted that Zhukov said \\"I am afraid your commander (Kirponos) here is pretty weak\\". Zhukov was soon forced to return to Moscow due to the critical situation developing along the Bialystok-Minsk- Smolensk axis, and the Southwestern Front, and newly formed Southern Front created on the basis of the Odessa Military District, were put under the umbrella of the \\"Southwestern Direction\\" commanded by Marshal Semyon Budyonny, a long time Stalin associate, in mid July, with disastrous results in the Battle of Uman. Afterwards, Kirponos' forces fought in the Battle of Kyiv. He was killed in action near Dryukivshchyna, southwest of Lokhvytsia while trying to breakout of the Kyiv encirclement, in which the Soviets ended up losing badly due to the overwhelming advantage by the Germans, which was exacerbated by the grave errors of Joseph Stalin and the high-ranking military leaders.Dehtiarenko Nevertheless, more than sixty years later and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kirponos remains highly regarded both in Ukraine and Russia for his exemplary military leadership, courage and valour.

He played as a goalkeeper from 1984 until 2003. He was part of the Blackburn Rovers side that won the Premier League in 1995 and earned 11 caps for England. He also played for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southampton, Swindon Town, Leicester City, Stockport County, Coventry City and Manchester City. Flowers has been manager at Stafford Rangers, Northampton Town (twice caretaker), Solihull Moors, and Macclesfield Town. Club career =Wolverhampton Wanderers= Flowers was born in Kenilworth and began his career with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1984. He quickly broke into the first team, becoming their regular goalkeeper by his 18th birthday, but his breakthrough came at the bleakest time in the club's history, as the two seasons he spent there both ended in relegation (in 1984‚Äì85) to the Third Division and in 1985‚Äì86 to the Fourth. After Wolves fell into the Fourth Division to complete a hat-trick of successive relegations, they had to sell Flowers as part of the effort to avoid bankruptcy. =Southampton= He joined First Division club Southampton for ¬£70,000 in June 1986. He was understudy to Peter Shilton in 1986‚Äì87, but managed nine league appearances (the first in a 5‚Äì1 defeat to Manchester United in mid September) and also played a further nine games on loan to Swindon Town in the Third Division. He made another nine league appearances in 1987‚Äì88 (by which time Shilton had joined Derby County) and returned to Swindon for a five-match loan spell, before becoming Southampton's regular goalkeeper in the 1989‚Äì90 season. Within a couple of years of becoming Southampton's first choice goalkeeper, Flowers was regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the English league and inevitable rumours of a transfer to a bigger club began. =Blackburn Rovers= He finally left Southampton on 4 November 1993 when a ¬£2.4million move to Blackburn Rovers made him the most expensive goalkeeper in Britain. His excellent goalkeeping was not quite enough to win Blackburn the Premier League title that season, but they did finish second to Manchester United, and went one better the following year when they won their first top division title since 1914. He remained at Ewood Park for another four seasons before Blackburn were relegated in 1999. =Leicester City= He was transferred to Leicester City, where he collected a Football League Cup winner's medal in his first season. In August 2002 he went on loan to Manchester City to provide cover for Carlo Nash after injuries to Peter Schmeichel and Nicky Weaver. He stayed with Leicester for one season after their relegation to Division One two years later before retiring as a player. His final appearance for Leicester City was against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux in May 2003. It was the final game of the season, and with Leicester 1‚Äì0 down, Flowers came on as a late substitute for Ian Walker. Leicester were awarded a late penalty, and despite shouts from the travelling Leicester fans for Flowers to take the penalty, and Flowers himself signalling to the bench, Micky Adams (then Leicester manager) ignored the fans, and allowed Trevor Benjamin to take it, who scored. International career Flowers won 11 caps with England between 1993 and 1998. He was in the squads for both Euro 96 in England and the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France.1998 FIFA World Cup: England Squad FIFA. Retrieved 22 January 2010. He retired following the 2002‚Äì03 season. Coaching and management  Following a spell as goalkeeper coach for both Leicester City and Manchester City, on 19 February 2007 he was appointed as assistant manager to Iain Dowie at Coventry City.

From 1851 to 1852, Aulick commanded the East India Squadron but was forced to give up command of the projected Japanese expedition to Commodore Matthew C. Perry.

They form the western branch of the South Semitic languages, itself a sub-branch of Semitic, part of the Afroasiatic language family. Amharic, the official working language of Federal Government of Ethiopia and Amhara Region, has about 21 million speakers (including second language speakers) and is the most widely spoken Ethiopian Semitic language. Tigrinya has 7 million speakers and is the most widely spoken language in Eritrea. There is a small population of Tigre speakers in Sudan. The Ge'ez language has a literary history in its own Ge'ez script going back to the first century AD. It is no longer spoken but remains the liturgical language of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, as well as their respective Eastern Catholic counterparts. The \\"homeland\\" of the South Semitic languages is widely debated, with sources such as A. Murtonen (1967) and Lionel Bender (1997),Bender, L (1997), \\"Upside Down Afrasian\\", Afrikanistische Arbeitspapiere 50, pp. 19-34 suggesting an origin in Ethiopia and others suggesting the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula. A study based on a Bayesian model to estimate language change concluded that the latter viewpoint may be more probable.Kitchen, Andrew, Christopher Ehret, et al. 2009. \\"Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of Semitic in the Near East.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 276 no. 1665 (June 22) The modern Ethiopian Semitic languages all share subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb (SOV) word order as part of the Ethiopian language area, but Ge'ez had verb-subject- object (VSO) order in common with other Semitic languages. Classification The division into northern and southern branches was established by Cohen (1931) and Hetzron (1972) and garnered broad acceptance, but this classification has recently been challenged by Rainer Voigt. Voigt rejects the classification that was put forward by Cohen and Hetzron, concluding that they are too closely related to be grouped separately into a north and south.

Overview MegaMek was started in 2000 by Ben Mazur and first made public with the initial revision on SourceForge in February 2002. Today MegaMek is developed and maintained by a community of volunteer programmers, with a small core of developers supported by numerous contributors. Originally hosted on SourceForge, the project is now hosted on GitHub and is distributed with its source code under the GNU General Public License. The game is written entirely in Java with graphics based on Swing, resulting in reasonable playability even on low-end platforms. Currently, MegaMek supports all the rules from the BattleTech introductory box set, most of the rules from the Total Warfare core rulebook, a number of advanced rules from the Tactical Operations rulebook, and some house rules. The game offers a bot that one can play against. It is capable of using most of the core features, but is unable to use many of the advanced rules. Also, most of the AeroTech rules from Total Warfare are implemented. The game currently supports multiplayer via TCP/IP, though play- by-email is possible through the exchange of saved games.

Greguriƒá was born in the Zagorje village of Lobor. He attended the Technical highschool in Zagreb, and then the Technical Faculty of the University of Zagreb. His work experience included the chemical factories \\"Radonja\\" in Sisak, and \\"Chromos\\" in Zagreb, where he advanced to the positions of a technical director. He then became a high-ranking official of \\"Astra\\", a large state-owned company from Zagreb that exported to the Soviet Union, and Greguriƒá worked in Moscow for some time. In the first democratic elections of 1990, Franjo Greguriƒá entered politics as a member of the Croatian Democratic Union. In the second Croatian government in 1990 he was a deputy prime minister. On 17 July 1991, he was appointed to the post of prime minister by President Franjo Tuƒëman. When he took his post, Croatia was in very difficult situation - its independence, declared on 25 June 1991, was not recognised by the international community and Croatia, unlike Slovenia, lacked proper military infrastructure to resist Krajina rebels backed by Yugoslav People's Army. Only few weeks later, following couple of disastrous setbacks for nascent and inexperienced Croatian military, his cabinet was reshuffled by introducing of members of other political parties represented in Croatian Parliament (with exception of Croatian Party of Rights). This cabinet, later dubbed as \\"Government of National Unity\\", was in charge when major combat operations in Croatia ceased on 3 January 1992, following UN-sponsored armistice. On 15 January 1992 Croatian independence was recognised by major European countries. This is hailed as the greatest achievement of Greguriƒá's cabinet, while Greguriƒá himself enjoyed favourable reputation because of his mild manners and managerial skills. His cabinet was often taken as a great example of national unity under difficult situation. Those achievements, however, must be taken into proper context. Foreign policy was in hands of Franjo Tuƒëman, while defence was in hands of Gojko ≈†u≈°ak and military officials responsible only to President. That left Greguriƒá with more mundane tasks like issuing first Croatian currency and setting up Croatian air traffic control and other institution previously in Yugoslav federal jurisdiction. With war generally perceived to be over and with prospects of new elections, \\"Government of National Unity\\" began to fall apart. In February 1992 his government proposed the laws offering territorial autonomy to ethnic Serbs in Krajina in exchange for their formal recognition of Croatian sovereignty. Dra≈æen Budi≈°a, one of government's ministers and leader of Croatian Social Liberal Party, left the government in protest. This was followed by representative of other parties who gradually left the government. By the end of his term, cabinet of Franjo Greguriƒá again had members of only one party. At parliamentary elections of 1992, Greguriƒá was elected as representative of HDZ and remained in that party. Greguriƒá was later the president of the Croatian Firefighting Association between 1993 and 2000. In May 2010, Greguriƒá was appointed the head of the Supervisory board at Institut IGH.

The first Secretaries' Day was sponsored by the National Secretaries Association with the support of corporate groups. In 1955, the observance date of National Secretaries Week was moved to the last full week of April, with Wednesday now designated as Administrative Professionals Day. The name was changed to Professional Secretaries Week in 1981 and became Administrative Professionals Week in 2000 to encompass the expanding responsibilities and wide-ranging job titles of administrative support staff in the modern economy. The week-long observance was created in order to space out the bookings at restaurants, country clubs, and other places where administrative professionals would be taken out to lunch.

Knowsley Safari Park is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). The safari park contributes to conservation and research through links with conservation projects and its links with universities in Liverpool, Chester and Manchester. History The park was opened in July 1971 by Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby and Jimmy ChipperfieldBBC, KNOWSLEY SAFARI PARK, 1986 using the expertise of general manager Laurence Tennant MBE, formerly the Chief Game Warden of Parks in Uganda and Botswana. Initially the road through the park was , with visitors driving past lions, cheetahs, monkeys, giraffes, zebra, elephants and various antelope. Due to the popularity of this route, an additional of road was added in 1973, and camels, buffalo, white rhino, and tigers were added to the park. Over the years, a few modifications have been made. For instance, tigers are now displayed in enclosures within the reserve, and a bypass around the baboons was built for visitors who are worried about damage to their cars. The park was also home to a former RAF airfield which closed at the end of World War II. The RAF airbase situated at the safari park was also known as No 49 SLG or RAF Knowsley Park and was in use between 13 May 1942 ‚Äì November 1944.http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/knowsley-park Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust The park has hosted several sporting events including the Olympic torch relay, watched by 6,000 children and families in June 2012. The park hosted the finish of Stage Two of the 2012 Tour of Britain cycling event and hosted Stage Three of the 2013 Tour in September of that year. Zoological collection Situated around Knowsley Hall on the ancestral estate of the Earl of Derby, the reserve is home to different animals. The Derby Estate have a tradition of keeping animals, ever since the famous artist and nonsense-poet Edward Lear was employed there in the 19th century to paint pictures of the Earl's collection. =Baboons= The park is open to the public and customers drive around the park in their own vehicles. There is a bypass route past the baboons for those who wish to avoid the risk of the baboons damaging their cars. In 2009 the baboons made the news all over the world when a video was released showing how they were intelligent and curious enough to open car roofboxes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCQtbLngkmM Baboons video on YouTube = Tiger Trail = Amur Tiger Trail opened 25 May 2018, home to the Amur Tiger otherwise known as the Siberian Tiger. The area is 10,000m2 and includes forested areas, natural streams and ponds. = The Equatorial Trail = This exhibit focuses on animals who thrive in habitats around the Earth's Equator. The exhibit also houses the 'Equatorial Express', a small train which visitors can ride to gain a unique viewpoint of the animals. 4 completely different species of animals are housed in this exhibit, the South American tapir, Sitatunga, Rhea and the Capybara. = African Elephant = Until 2017 the park housed a herd of 4 adult cows named Tana, Ashanti, Nala and Juba. They were transported to Zoo Parc d'Beauval, France to enter the European Breeding Programme and allow for transformations on Knowsley Safari's Foot Safari. Knowsley previously housed a bull named Nissim, who collapsed in June 2014. Knowsley also recently lost their cow named Shaba due to a long battle with elephant arthritis. = Southern White Rhinoceros = Knowsley's crash of 11 adult rhinos is one of the most successful and genetically diverse breeding groups in Europe. The latest calf (as at 4 June 2016), Nomvula (Mother of Rain ‚Äì a reference to the recent wet weather), born to mum Meru and is the 19th to be born at the facility in the last 40 years. Nomvula is Meru's 6th calf and was born on 2 January 2016.  Safari Drive  The Safari Drive is the park's main attraction and contains over 29 species of animals in 7 zones. = Zone 1+11 - Eastern Asia = This zone contains: P√®re David's deer, Yak, Kiang and Bactrian camel. = Zone 2+8 - Southern Asia = This zone contains: Blackbuck, Nilgai, Eld's deer, Chital (Axis Deer) and Barasingha. = Zone 3+4+6 - African Savannah = Zone 6 is over 100 acres and contains over a mile of road. It is one of Knowsley's two white rhino paddocks and is one of the largest in the UK. This zone contains: Southern White Rhino, Roan antelope, Eland, Lechwe, Wildebeest, Plains Zebra, African Forest Buffalo, Ostritch and Waterbuck. = Zone 5 - African Woodland = This zone contains: Blesbok and Bongo = Zone 7 - African Savannah = This zone contains exclusively the Olive baboon, which are famous for removing windscreen wipers and other appendages off vehicles. There is a car-friendly route which totally removes this zone however is still visible from outside the perimeter. This leads directly to zone 6. Various animals have been housed with the baboons in the past. Examples are: Barbary sheep, Nilgai, Ankole Cattle and Zebras. Other types of monkeys were housed with the baboons in the past, which were: Hamadryas baboons, Chacma baboons, Yellow Baboons and Drills, according to the 1972 guidebook. = Zone 9 - Eurasia = This zone contains: European Bison, Fallow Deer and European Moose = Zone 10 - African Savannah = This zone contains: Lion, and the Somali wild ass. This zone previously housed African wild dog, Iberian Wolf and Siberian Tiger. Railway and other attractions The park features a gauge railway, 'The Lakeside Railway', on which visitors may tour parts of the site. There is also a collection of amusements and fairground rides on site plus paintballing, off- road driving challenges, and aerial extreme ropewalks. A baboon house was added in 2006, along with African wild dogs that same year, a lion and tiger house in 2007. Red river hogs and marmosets were also added to the walkaround section, as well as an outdoor pool. =Animal care= In January 2011, local animal rights activists held a peaceful demonstration after an inspection by government vets found one instance of a breach of regulations on the disposal of animal ‚Äòby-products‚Äô. The park has since installed an enclosure for the storage of animal carcasses before disposal.

The program premiered on NBC on July 7, 1975 at 12:00 pm ET, replacing the short-lived game show Blank Check. Merrill Heatter and Bob Quigley packaged the program, with Robert Noah as executive producer. Art James served as host, and Johnny Gilbert was the announcer. This is one of the few Heatter-Quigley programs that Kenny Williams was not involved with. Gameplay Two contestants competed, one a returning champion, each paired with a celebrity partner. In the first half of the game, the teams answered general knowledge questions, frequently involving puns or other wordplay, that were displayed on a large electronic marquee, similar to one found on a pinball's backbox display. The players were shown blanks on the display's bottom line denoting the number of words and letters in the answer. A clue then crawled across the display's upper line. If no team buzzed in once the clue was revealed, letters of the answer then filled in at random as time progressed. For example, with the clue \\"He's center and he's square\\", and blanks displaying \\"#### #####\\", the correct answer is \\"Paul Lynde\\". James occasionally gave an additional clue before the main clue scrolled across the marquee. For any given question, only the contestant or the celebrity was eligible to buzz in. This alternated with each question, and was indicated by lighted panels in front of the eligible player. Correct answers each scored one point. Five points won the game, and the winning team played \\"The Magnificent Marble Machine\\" in the bonus round. =Bonus round= The winning team played the show's centerpiece: a giant pinball machine measuring 20 feet high and 12 feet long. Each team member manipulated one button, each of which controlled two flippers, and tried to keep the ball in play for as long as possible within a 60-second time limit. The team accumulated points by hitting bumpers, noisemakers and lights. Hitting any of the seven large numbered bumpers won the contestant a prize, with bumpers two and three together earning a larger prize, such as a car or trip. Play ended if the ball fell into one of the two \\"out holes\\" (one located below the main flippers, the other in the middle of the playing field). The flippers were disabled when 60 seconds expired, with the ball (still in play) usually entering an out hole within a few seconds. At some point during the series, a bonus prize was added for hitting all seven numbered bumpers at least once. Originally, each bumper scored 500 points while any noisemaker scored 200 points. Producers audited the score by watching the tape to ensure that each scoring feature had registered, but scoring errors increased week by week as the machine aged. The rules were eventually altered so that only the seven \\"thumper bumpers\\" added 500 points for each hit, with nothing else scoring. Money ball If a team reached a target score after playing two balls, the team played a bonus \\"gold money ball\\" in which the player earned $200 for each noisemaker and bumper. The goal was originally 15,000 points for each new champion, and lowered by 1,000 for each return visit. Later, the goal started at 13,000 points, and the money ball earned $500 for each bumper hit. At some point in the run, this round was redesigned to be a multi-player \\"money ball marathon\\" rather than a bonus round any player might be able to achieve in any one play of the machine. The contestant achieving the top point score over a two-week period was awarded a money ball round. This format lasted for five marathons (ten weeks), after which the money ball was dropped from the game altogether. After the money ball round was removed, the electronic point counters on the pinball machine were covered over. Contestants then only played for prizes obtained by hitting the seven bumpers. Format change In early 1976, game play changed to feature two teams of two celebrities each playing the front game. The winning team headed to the machine. One celebrity drew a name from the drum (filled out by the studio audience) and the lucky person played the bonus round with each celebrity. Broadcast history The Magnificent Marble Machine aired in its original time slot until November 28, 1975. On December 1, 1975, the series replaced Three for the Money at 12:30 PM so Wheel of Fortune could expand to an hour. With the move, Marble was reduced in length to 25 minutes as a national newscast anchored by Edwin Newman aired at 12:55. After the January 2, 1976 broadcast, the show was pulled from the schedule for a two-week trial run of Take My Advice, a talk show hosted by KNBC news anchor Kelly Lange. When Marble returned on January 19, it changed to an all-celebrity format, which finally brought on its demise. While the last first-run episode aired March 12, its replacement, The Fun Factory, was postponed because of a technicians' strike, resulting in repeats airing through June 11. In popular culture A brief clip from The Magnificent Marble Machine is seen in the 1979 film The China Syndrome, as the \\"regularly scheduled programming\\" that the TV station interrupts to show the main character's report from inside the power plant. The clip shows celebrity guest Joan Rivers playing a normal ball on the machine, though the original audio is dubbed over with musicwritten by composer Michael Small and included on the film's soundtrack release (\\"Source Suite #1\\") composed for the film. The film's credits do not mention the show, Rivers or Heatter-Quigley.

From 1981 to 1989, he was a spokesman for the communist Council of Ministers. From April to September 1989, he was a minister without portfolio and chairman of the Polish Radio and Television. From 1990 is the editor-in-chief of the weekly NIE and the owner of the Urma publishing company. Biography =Before 1989= He was born into an assimilated Polish-Jewish family in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. His father was a journalist and activist of the Polish Socialist Party as well as the Bund. He spent his early childhood in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. He lived at 134 Piotrkowska Street, in a transverse outbuilding on the first floor. In the autumn of 1939 he moved with his family to Lviv. Jerzy's father received an engineer job at the State Institute of City Design. The whole family adopted Soviet citizenship. During this time, the family officially changed the name from \\"Urbach\\" to \\"Urban\\". After German invasion of the Soviet Union, they had to hide in the Eastern Borderlands. Initially, they stayed in the village of Budaniv near Terebovlia, later in Ternopil. From 1944 they lived first in Che≈Çm, then in Lublin. They returned to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ at the beginning of 1945. After the end of the war, Jerzy Urban attended seventeen different primary and secondary schools. In 1948 he joined the Union of Polish Youth, of which he was an active member. From 1951 to 1954 he was studied journalism at the University of Warsaw, but did not graduate. In 1951 he began journalistic career. In July 1955 he became a journalist of the weekly \\"Po prostu\\". From January 1956 he was the head of the political department. After the liquidation of the weekly, Urban was officially banned from publishing under his name. From 1961 he worked in \\"Polityka\\", when he wrote under Pseudonyms. In 1963 he was banned from working in journalism. After some time, Zenon Kliszko, who was then Gomu≈Çka's right hand, allowed him to take up a job provided he did not disclose himself. The ban on journalistic work for Jerzy Urban was officially withdrawn only after W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka's departure from power. After some time, despite remaining independent, he assumed the position of head of the national department of \\"Polityka\\". Despite his critical attitude towards Edward Gierek's rule, he was an opponent of the Solidarity movement in 1980 and often criticized its leaders (including Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa). From 1981 to 1989, he was a spokesman for the Council of Ministers. He created the tradition of weekly press conferences, transmitted by the Polish television and attended by both Polish and foreign journalists. He criticized the priest Jerzy Popie≈Çuszko as an anti-communist Savonarola.Jan Rem, Seanse Nienawi≈õci, ‚ÄûTu i Teraz\\", 19 wrze≈õnia 1984 In 1986 Urban masterminded a media story that the United States had betrayed the Solidarity movement. He met with a Washington Post reporter and told him that a Polish spy for the CIA, who was later identified as Ryszard Kukli≈Ñski, was aware of the plan to install martial law in 1981 and had passed that information on to Washington. \\"The US administration could have publicly revealed these plans to the world and warned Solidarity,\\" Urban said, \\"Had it done so, the implementation of martial law would have been impossible.\\"Bob Woodward and Michael Dobbs, \\"CIA had Secret Agent on Polish General Staff,\\" The Washington Post, 4 June 1986, p. A1. At press conference Urban alleged that \\"Washington ... did not warn its allies. It did not boast of its agent as it customarily does.\\" According to Urban, the Reagan administration had \\"lied to its own people and to its friends in Poland,\\" when it denied having prior knowledge of martial law. He did not protest against the campaign against homosexuals in the 1980s. In 1986, when asked about the Operation Hyacinth in an interview with the American press, he denied that it ever took place. From April to September 1989, he was a minister without portfolio and chairman of the Polish Radio and Television. From 1989 to 1990, he was a member of the Polish United Workers' Party. In 1989 Polish legislative election he unsuccessfully ran for the Sejm as an independent candidate. He eventually obtained around 34,000 votes.

Currently it is the world's second highest concrete arch dam with a height of . It is located north of the town Jvari. It is part of the Enguri hydroelectric power station (HES) which is partially located in Abkhazia. History Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev initially proposed a major dam and hydroelectric power scheme on the Bzyb River as his favourite resort was located near the mouth of the river at Pitsunda. However, his experts informed him that a dam built on the Bzyb River would have had catastrophic effects in causing beach erosion at Pitsunda, so in the end the dam was built on the Enguri River instead, where the impact upon the coastline was assessed to be considerably less pronounced. Construction of the Enguri dam began in 1961. The dam became temporarily operational in 1978, and was completed in 1987. In 1994, the dam was inspected by engineers of Hydro- Qu√©bec, who found that the dam was \\"in a rare state of dilapidation\\". In 1999, the European Commission granted ‚Ç¨9.4 million to Georgia for urgent repairs at the Enguri HES, including replacing the stoplog at the arch dam on the Georgian side and, refurbishing one of the five generators of the power station at the Abkhaz side. In total, ‚Ç¨116 million loans were granted by the EBRD, the European Union, the Japanese Government, KfW and Government of Georgia. In 2011 The European Investment Bank (EIB) loaned ‚Ç¨20 million in order to complete the rehabilitation of the Enguri hydropower plant and to ensure safe water evacuation towards the Black Sea at the Vardnili hydropower cascade.Hydropower in Georgia receives boost from EIB (ENPI Info Centre)  Technical features  Distribution of the Enguri HES facilities in Abkhazia and Georgia proper.

It is used as a bird scarer in the vineyards of traditional wine-growing landscapes of Slovenia, Austria, and Croatia. It is one of the symbols of Slovenia and Styria. The windmill in the Slovene Hills typically has four blades, and in Haloze six blades, driving an axis with a sail or vane that is constructed to swivel so it is always positioned perpendicular to the wind. As the axis rotates, wooden hammers are lifted off their resting position by fixed notches. As they fall back, they rhythmically impact on a wooden board. While the quality of the sound is dependent on the wood of which the hammers and sounding boards are made, the rattle frequency depends on the number of hammers, as well as changes in wind speed. The device is used primarily to scare starlings and other birds off the vineyards so that they do not peck grapes. A folk belief also states that klopotecs drive snakes from the vineyards and soften grapes. In Catholic folk music of its region of origin, it is sometimes combined with an organ stop and used as a rural church instrument (e.g. in Gleisdorf parish church).  Name  The device has many names. In Slovene it is called klopotec and in some dialects klapoc. Both words derive from klopotati, that is to produce cut off, rhythmic sounds. In German it is called Windradl or Windm√ºhle; ever increasing is the use of the word Klapotetz and also Klapotez. In English it could be described as a bird- scaring rattle, a wind-rattle or a wind-clapper.  History  Although a local historian from Maribor claims that the device appeared in Haloze and in Zagorje already in the 16th century, nothing particular is known about its origin. An educated guess has been made that it developed during the period of the Enlightenment. According to the most plausible theory held by the majority of ethnologists, including the German ethnologist Leopold Kretzenbacher, the bird-scaring rattle is of Slovene origin. Another theory claims that it was first used in the 18th century in the fields by the French. The first written mentions of klopotec date to the second half of the 18th century, whereas its oldest depictions date to the first half of the 19th century. The device is also mentioned in the oldest Slovene social poem, Lamentation of a Winedresser, written in 1797 by Leopold Volkmer. Archduke Johann of Austria (1782‚Äì1859), the youngest brother of the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, had it in his vineyard in 1836. Still earlier than this, however, is the mention of the Klapperm√ºhle in German writings from at least the 16th century, which could signify either a true mill intentionally designed to scare birds away especially from fruit trees, or a smaller windmill-like device similar to the klopotec.http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=klappermuehle  Construction  A klopotec consists of different parts, each of which should (ideally) be made of a specific type of wood to produce a fine and melodic sound. The wood of hammers and of the board is especially important, as only the right combination enables that the device produces the ultrasound that scares the birds away. The parts are: * stolƒçek (block) - holds the axle; made from a hardwood (e.g. chestnut, oak or ash). * kvaka (axle) - holes are drilled into it and hammers or macleki are attached onto it. * macleki (hammers) - should be set up in such a way that only one of them strikes at a time. The best wood is beechwood, but some other types of wood can be used. * deska (board) - macleki strike against it; made from chestnut or cherry. * viliƒçice (pl.;little forks) - hold macleki; made from oak or beech. * veri≈æica (chainlet) - the board is hanged on it. * rep (tail) - enables the rattle to turn with the wind; made from the sprigs of the oak, pine or other tree, as by these species the leaves remain attached for the longest time. Also an old broom can be used as a tail. * vetrnica (sail) - rotates in the wind and transfers the rotation onto the axle; made from poplar or fir wood. The sail from the Slovene Hills has four blades, while the one from Haloze has six blades and the one from the Austrian Styria has eight blades. * zavora (brake) - part of especially large rattles; prevents them from stopping in a forceful wind. The largest construction of this type in a natural setting stands in the Sausal mountain range, near the summit of the Demmerkogel. It is 16 meters high, and its moving parts mass 3.4 metric tons. Each of the eight hammers weighs 40 kilograms.  Tradition  The klopotec is most frequently heard in the transnational region from Southwest Styria (e.g., the Sausal mountain range and the Weinstra√üe) to Eastern Slovenia: the Slovene Hills, Haloze and Prlekija (of which it is a symbol), less frequently in Lower Carniola and White Carniola. It is also found in Southwestern Slovenia, in the Littoral Region and in Croatia's Zagorje region. These areas traditionally produce white wines. Traditionally such rattles have been set up on 25 July (Feast of Saint James) or on 15 August (Assumption Day), but also on any day in between. They have usually been taken down after the vintage till 1 November (All Saints Day), but no later than on 11 November (Feast of Saint Martin). If a husbandman forgets to take it down, the youth from the village can steal it and leave a message about the ransom that he must pay to get it back. Some of these bird-rattle devices are ornamented with small carved figurines. The traditional types which are made solely from wood are becoming more and more rare, as they are getting replaced by devices with metal elements. Motif The Post of Slovenia issued a stamp worth 13 Slovenian tolars in 1997 featuring klopotec. The stamp was a part of the collection Slovenija - Evropa v malem (\\"Slovenia - Europe in Miniature\\"). * One of the meetings of Slovenian folk musicians that happens annually is called Veseli klopotec (\\"Happy Klopotec\\"). * The Slovenian Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for the Protection of Copyright (SAZAS) yearly confers the Zlati klopotec (\\"Golden Klopotec\\") award to the author of the best popular song in a Slovene dialect for that year.

A convinced communist, he defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, where he continued his research on the decay of the muon and on neutrinos. The prestigious Pontecorvo Prize was instituted in his memory in 1995. The fourth of eight children of a wealthy Jewish-Italian family, Pontecorvo studied physics at the University of Rome La Sapienza, under Fermi, becoming the youngest of his Via Panisperna boys. In 1934 he participated in Fermi's famous experiment showing the properties of slow neutrons that led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission. He moved to Paris in 1934, where he conducted research under Ir√®ne and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot- Curie. Influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he joined the French Communist Party, as did his sisters Giuliana and Laura and brother Gillo. The Italian Fascist regime's 1938 racial laws against Jews caused his family members to leave Italy for Britain, France and the United States. When the German Army closed in on Paris during the Second World War, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and Salvador Luria fled the city on bicycles. He eventually made his way to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he applied his knowledge of nuclear physics to prospecting for oil and minerals. In 1943, he joined the British Tube Alloys team at the Montreal Laboratory in Canada. This became part of the Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic bombs. At Chalk River Laboratories, he worked on the design of the nuclear reactor ZEEP, the first reactor outside of the United States that went critical in 1945, followed by the NRX reactor in 1947. He also looked into cosmic rays, the decay of muons, and what would become his obsession, neutrinos. He moved to Britain in 1949, where he worked for the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. After his defection to the Soviet Union in 1950, he worked at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna. He had proposed using chlorine to detect neutrinos. In a 1959 paper, he argued that the electron neutrino () and the muon neutrino () were different particles. Solar neutrinos were detected by the Homestake Experiment, but only between one third and one half of the predicted number were found. In response to this solar neutrino problem, he proposed a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation, whereby electron neutrinos became muon neutrinos. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998. He also predicted in 1958 that supernovae would produce intense bursts of neutrinos, which was confirmed in 1987 when Supernova SN1987A was detected by neutrino detectors.

Pontecorvo was born on 22 August 1913 in Marina di Pisa, the fourth of eight children of Massimo Pontecorvo and his wife Maria . His older brother Guido, who was born in 1907, became a geneticist. His brother Paolo, who was born in 1909, became an engineer who worked on radar during World War II. His older sister Giuliana was born in 1911. His younger brother Gillo was born in 1919, and is best known as the director of The Battle of Algiers. He also had two younger sisters; Laura, who was born in 1921, and Anna, who was born in 1924, and a younger brother Giovanni, who was born in 1926. His family was a wealthy family; Massimo owned three textile factories employing over 1,000 people. The family was Jewish and non-observant,Simone Turchetti.

Ebrei e fascismo a Bologna (p. 127) He enterered the University of Pisa intending to study engineering, but after two years he decided to switch to physics in 1931. On the advice of his brother Guido, he decided to study at the University of Rome La Sapienza, where Enrico Fermi had gathered together a group of promising young scientists known as the Via Panisperna boys after the name of the street where the Institute of Physics of Rome University was then situated. At the age of 18 he was admitted to the third year of Physics. Fermi described Pontecorvo as \\"scientifically one of the brightest men with whom I have come in contact in my scientific career\\". As their youngest member, the group nicknamed him Cucciolo, which means \\"puppy\\". In 1934, Pontecorvo contributed to Fermi's famous experiment showing the properties of slow neutrons that led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission. Pontecorvo's name was included on the Via Panisperna boys' patent \\"To increase the production of artificial radioactivity with neutron bombardment\\". He was made a temporary assistant at the Royal Institute of Physics on 1 November 1934 and the University of Rome, and on 7 November, he was listed as co-author, along with Fermi and Rasetti, of a landmark paper on slow neutrons that reported that hydrogen slowed neutrons more than heavy elements, and that slow neutrons were more easily absorbed. An Italian patent was granted for the process in October 1935, in the name of Fermi, Pontecorvo, Edoardo Amaldi, Franco Rasetti and Emilio Segr√®. A US patent was granted on 2 July 1940.. The US patent was . =Early career= In February 1936, Pontecorvo left Italy and moved to Paris to work in the laboratory of Ir√®ne and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie at the Coll√®ge de France on a one-year scholarship to study the effects of collisions of neutrons with protons and on the electromagnetic transitions among isomers. During this period, influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he adopted the ideals of communism to which he remained loyal for the rest of his life. He formed a relationship with Helene Marianne Nordblom, a Swedish woman working in Paris as a nanny. Whether because of his relationship with Marianne, his interesting work on isomers, or the deteriorating political situation in Italy, he turned down an opportunity in 1937 to apply for a tenured position at the University of Rome to stay in Paris. Marianne moved in with Pontecorvo at the H√¥tel des Grands Hommes on the Place du Panth√©on on 4 January 1938. Their son, Gil, was born on 30 July. Her visa expired, and she had to return to Sweden in September. Pontecorvo accompanied her, leaving Gil behind in a residential nursery in Paris. Travelling back to Paris alone, he dined with Manne Siegbahn and met with Niels Bohr and Lisa Meitner on 12 October 1938. Pontecorvo was now unable to return to Italy because of the Fascist regime's racial laws against the Jews. This caused the breakup of the Via Panisperna boys, with Fermi moving to the United States. Pontecorvo's family also dispersed. Guido moved to Britain in 1938, followed by Giovanni, Laura and Anna in 1939, while Gillo joined Pontecorvo in Paris. Working in collaboration with the French physicist Andr√© Lazard at Joliot-Curie's laboratory at Ivry-sur-Seine, Pontecorvo discovered what Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie called \\"nuclear phosphorescence\\"; the emission of X-rays when neutrons and protons were excited and returned to their ground state. He also discovered that some isomers do not change into other elements on decaying radioactively. This expanded the scope for their use in medical applications. For this ground- breaking research, Pontecorvo received a Curie-Carnegie scholarship, and funding for his work from the French National Centre for Scientific Research. =Second World War= Escape from France In June 1939, Pontecorvo applied for a visa to visit Sweden, but his application was rejected. On 23 August came the news of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. He joined the French Communist Party the next day as an affirmation of his personal faith in the Soviet Union. Marianne rejoined him in Paris on 6 September 1939, three days after the British and French declaration of war on Germany in response to the German invasion of Poland that started the Second World War in Europe. They were married on 9 January 1940. As the Germans closed in on the city in May 1940, they decided to leave. Although the British offered refuge to French nuclear scientists, including Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, they regarded Pontecorvo as an \\"undesirable\\". Fortunately, Segr√® had been given an offer of employment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by two European expatriates who were looking for an expert on neutron physics. Segr√® had turned down the offer ‚Äî he already had a good job at the University of California ‚Äî but recommended Pontecorvo. On 2 June 1940, he saw Marianne and Gil off with their chattels on a train to Toulouse, where his sister Giuliana lived with her husband, Duccio Tabet. On 13 June, just a day before the Germans entered Paris, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and Salvador Luria set out for Toulouse on bicycles. It took them ten days to reach Toulouse. Luria went to Marseilles, from whence he eventually made his way to the United States. Pontecorvo, Marianna, Gil, Giuliana and Tabet boarded a train that took them to Lisbon via Madrid on 19 July 1940. Both women were pregnant. Marianne had a miscarriage, and was hardly fit to travel, but nonetheless boarded the liner Quanza on 9 August 1940 on its voyage bringing refugees to the United States. Both women were seasick. On 19 August 1940, the ship reached New York City, where they stayed with his brother Paolo. While there, he visited Fermi at his new home in Leonia, New Jersey. Prospecting in Oklahoma In Tulsa, Pontecorvo went to work for two European migrants, Jakov \\"Jake\\" Neufeld and Serge Alexandrovich Scherbatskoy, who had founded a company called Well Surveys with funds provided by Standard Oil. Their idea was to apply nuclear physics to searching for minerals. A gamma ray device had been successful at analysing rock outcroppings. Inspired by the work done in Italy and France, they reasoned that neutrons, being without electrical charge, might be able to detect different elements beneath the surface by inducing radioactivity on the rocks. In Pontecorvo, they had the expert they needed. Pontecorvo created a neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with paraffin wax as a neutron moderator, and measured the absorption of different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application of the discovery of slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.. The patents were: , , and . By late 1941, Pontecorvo was having difficulty securing the radioisotopes that he needed. Unbeknown to him, the Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to build atomic bombs, was cornering the market. In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and George Placzek in New York in April 1942. He was unable to secure the supplies he wanted, but Fermi showed an unexpected keen interest in the Wells Surveys work. Tube Alloys The meeting with Fermi yielded no supplies, but it did result in Pontecorvo receiving an offer from von Halban and Placzek to join the Tube Alloys team at the Montreal Laboratory in Canada. There was some concern from Sir Edward Appleton over his appointment, not because of Pontecorvo's political beliefs, but on account of the fact that he was not a British national, and there were already a large number of foreign scientists working on Tube Alloys. Appleton was ultimately persuaded due to Pontecorvo's reputation, and the fact that good physicists were in short supply. Pontecorvo was officially appointed to Tube Alloys on 15 January 1943, and arrived in Montreal with his family on 7 February 1943. The Montreal team designed a nuclear reactor using heavy water as a neutron moderator, but lacked the quantity of heavy water needed. In August 1943, Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of cooperation between the United States and Great Britain, merging Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project. NRX and ZEEP buildings at Chalk River in 1945. NRX was for a time the world's most powerful research reactor. John Cockcroft became director of the Montreal Laboratory in 1944. For safety reasons, he decided to build the reactor at the remote Chalk River Laboratories. With an eye on a post-war nuclear program, he had Pontecorvo and Allan Nunn May \\"debrief\\" Manhattan Project scientists who visited Canada, in practice spying for Britain. Unfortunately, Nunn May was also a Soviet spy. Pontecorvo's second son was born on 20 March 1944, and was named Tito after the Yugoslavian communist leader. A third son, Antonio, was born in July 1945. With heavy water supplied by the United States, the reactor at Chalk River, known as ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945. In addition to reactor design, Pontecorvo also looked into cosmic rays, the decay of muons, and what would become his obsession, neutrinos. He wrote 25 papers related to reactor design, although only two were published. He also did some prospecting with his old firm, searching for uranium deposits near Port Radium in the Northwest Territories. Physicists were in great demand after the war ended in August 1945, and Pontecorvo received attractive and lucrative offers from several universities in the United States. Instead, on 21 February 1946, he accepted an offer from Cockcroft to join the British Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE). For the time being, he remained at Chalk River for the commissioning of the new NRX reactor in 1947. He was one of four physicists present in the control room when the NRX was started up on the night of 21‚Äì22 July 1947. At the time, it had five times the neutron flux of any other reactor, and was the most powerful research reactor in the world. He acquired the nickname \\"Ramon Novarro\\" after the actor of that name following an adventure in which he made a trip to Boston with two women, which culminated in Marianne clearing out the bank account and departing for Banff with the children; but they were reconciled. Although he had previously taken steps to become a United States citizen, he instead became a British subject on 7 February 1948. He finally departed Chalk River for the United Kingdom on 24 January 1949. =Defection= At Harwell, Pontecorvo continued to be involved in reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of the production and use of fissile materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors. In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segr√®, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor‚Äîand nuclear weapon‚Äîdesign. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Giuliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C. In February 1950, Pontecorvo's Harwell colleague Klaus Fuchs was arrested for espionage, and the AERE began to take security more seriously, and Pontecorvo was interviewed by Henry Arnold, the security officer at AERE. While Arnold had no evidence that Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy, he did feel that he was a security risk, and recommended that he be moved to a position where he did not have access to Top Secret material. Herbert Skinner suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the University of Liverpool, where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics. In June 1950, Pontecorvo was offered the position. On 1 September 1950, in the middle of a holiday in Italy, Pontecorvo abruptly flew from Rome to Stockholm with his wife and three sons without informing friends or relatives. On 2 September he was helped by Soviet agents to enter the Soviet Union from Finland. His abrupt disappearance caused much concern to many of the western intelligence services, especially those of Britain, Canada and the United States, that were worried about the escape of atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and of Finland and Sweden, through which Pontecorvo and Marianne had been allowed to travel without valid passports and visas. In 1952, Pontecorvo's potential role in the transfer of nuclear secrets to Russia was discussed in American newspapers. According to Oleg Gordievsky, the highest-ranking KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy director of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied that he was a spy. The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had made their way to the Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect. In the USSR Pontecorvo was welcomed with honours and given a number of privileges reserved only to the Soviet nomenklatura. He worked until his death in what is now the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, concentrating entirely on theoretical studies of high energy particles and continuing his research on neutrinos and decay of muons. In recognition of his research he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1953, membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1955 and the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1958, and two Orders of Lenin. He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1964 for his work on the weak interaction. He began a lifelong affair with Rodam Amiredzhibi, the wife of poet Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov, in 1950. In 1955, he appeared in public at a press conference where he explained to the world the motivations of his choice to leave the West and work in the Soviet Union. As a result, the United Kingdom revoked his British citizenship on 24 May 1955. Pontecorvo was not permitted to leave the Soviet Union for many years; his first trip abroad being in 1978 when he travelled to Italy for celebrations of Amaldi's 70th birthday. Thereafter, he made frequent trips to Italy, and occasional visits to other countries. France refused to allow him to visit in 1982 and 1984, but relented in 1989. =Later life= The scientific work of Pontecorvo is full of formidable intuitions, some of which have represented milestones in modern physics. Much of this involved the neutrino, a subatomic particle first proposed theoretically by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 in order to explain undetected energy that escaped during beta decay so that the law of conservation of energy was not violated. Fermi named it the neutrino, Italian for \\"little neutral one\\", and in 1934, proposed his theory of beta decay which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino. Initially neutrinos were thought to be undetectable, but in 1945 Pontecorvo noted that a neutrino striking a chlorine nucleus could transform it into unstable argon-37 that emits, with a 34 days half-life, after a K-capture reaction, a 2.8 keV Auger electron allowing its direct detection: : + ‚Üí + Supernova SN1987A (the bright object in the centre), as seen through the Hubble Space Telescope Pontecorvo's 1945 paper credits the idea using carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to the French physicist Jules Gu√©ron. Experiments were conducted at Chalk River using the NRX as a neutrino source, but were unsuccessful, and were abandoned in 1949, after Pontecorvo had left. The experiment was unsuccessful because, unknown at the time, nuclear reactors produced antineutrinos instead of neutrinos. In what is now known as the Cowan‚ÄìReines neutrino experiment, Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan detected antineutrinos in 1955, for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995. The idea was taken up again in the search for solar neutrinos. Theoretically, the Sun produced neutrinos in the course of nuclear fusion reactions. Pontecorvo credited Maurice Pryce for this idea. The most common, the proton‚Äìproton chain reaction in which hydrogen is fused to form helium produces neutrinos that are not energetic enough to interact with chlorine. However, the much less common CNO cycle that produces carbon, nitrogen and oxygen does. In the late 1960s, Ray Davis and John N. Bahcall detected solar neutrinos in the Homestake Experiment, for which Davis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. The experiment was the first to successfully detect and count solar neutrinos, but the number of neutrinos detected was between one third and one half of the predicted number. This became the solar neutrino problem. For a time, scientists contemplated the awful possibility that the Sun might have burned out. The problem had already been solved by Pontecorvo in 1968. In 1959, a powerful accelerator (that was never built) was being designed, and he began considering experiments that could be performed with it. He contemplated a project investigating muons. Julian Schwinger had hypothesised that particles experience the weak interaction through exchanging W bosons. The W boson would not be discovered until 1983, but a problem immediately surfaced. Gerald Feinberg pointed out that this implied that some interactions that had never been observed should occur, but conceded that this was only true if the neutrinos associated with electrons were the same as those associated with muons. In a 1959 paper, Pontecorvo listed 21 possible reactions involving neutrinos and noted that some of them could not occur unless the electron neutrino () and the muon neutrino () were one and the same. (Thus an inability to find those reactions would be evidence that there were two types of neutrinos.) This paper introduced this notation for neutrinos, which we use today, and listed the reasons why he felt that having two types of neutrinos was \\"attractive from the point of view of symmetry and the classification of particles\\". The prediction that neutrinos associated with electrons are different from those associated with muons was confirmed in 1962. In 1988 Jack Steinberger, Leon M. Lederman and Melvin Schwartz were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the muon neutrino. Pontecorvo's gravestone at the Cimitero Acattolico di Roma Pontecorvo's solution to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This was the idea that neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments. This prediction was recognised by the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics, awarded to Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald \\"for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass\\". Pontecorvo also predicted in 1958 that supernovae would produce intense bursts of neutrinos. Few scientists were more excited when Supernova SN1987A was detected by neutrino detectors. Pontecorvo died in Dubna on 24 September 1993, afflicted by Parkinson's disease. In accordance with his wishes, half of his ashes were buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome, and another half in Dubna in Russia. In 1995, in recognition of his scientific merits, the prestigious Pontecorvo Prize has been instituted by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The prize, awarded annually to an individual scientist, recognises \\"the most significant investigations in elementary particle physics\\", as acknowledged by the international scientific community. In 2006, Moscow historical society Moskultprog unveiled an artistic plaque celebrating Pontecorvo's Moscow house at 9 Tverskaya Street.

It can be seen that the fuel has failed mechanically and has formed a pool near the bottom of the bundle, the bottom of the bundle did not melt. A fuel element failure is a rupture in a nuclear reactor's fuel cladding that allows the nuclear fuel or fission products, either in the form of dissolved radioisotopes or hot particles, to enter the reactor coolant or storage water. The de facto standard nuclear fuel is uranium dioxide or a mixed uranium/plutonium dioxide. This has a higher melting point than the actinide metals. Uranium dioxide resists corrosion in water and provides a stable matrix for many of the fission products; however, to prevent fission products (such as the noble gases) from leaving the uranium dioxide matrix and entering the coolant, the pellets of fuel are normally encased in tubes of a corrosion-resistant metal alloy (normally Zircaloy for water-cooled reactors). Those elements are then assembled into bundles to allow good handling and cooling. As the fuel fissions, the radioactive fission products are also contained by the cladding, and the entire fuel element can then be disposed of as nuclear waste when the reactor is refueled. If, however, the cladding is damaged, those fission products (which are not immobile in the uranium dioxide matrix) can enter the reactor coolant or storage water and can be carried out of the core, into the rest of the primary cooling circuit, increasing contamination levels there. In the EU, some work has been done in which fuel is overheated in a special research reactor named PHEBUS. During these experiments the emissions of radioactivity from the fuel are measured and afterwards the fuel is subjected to Post Irradiation Examination to discover more about what happened to it.

He is known for being a regular presenter at multiple hacking conferences, but is best known as the creator of the \\"Binary Revolution\\" initiative, including being the founding host and producer of Binary Revolution Radio, a long-running weekly Internet radio show which ran 200 episodes from 2003 to 2007. Biography Blake was born in Newport News, Virginia on September 13, 1971. He received an AAS (Associates in Applied Sciences) degree from the University of Kentucky 1992, and has a BS in Computer Science from Florida Atlantic University as well as a CEH certificate. He presently lives and works as a computer programmer/analyst in Orlando, Florida. Blake is a member of the International High IQ society. Hacking StankDawg is a staff writer for the well-known hacker periodical 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, as well as the now-defunct Blacklisted! 411 magazine. He has also been a contributing writer to several independent zines such as Outbreak, Frequency, and Radical Future. He has been a frequent co- host of Default Radio and was a regular on Radio Freek America, and has appeared on GAMERadio, Infonomicon, The MindWar, Phreak Phactor, and HPR (Hacker Public Radio). He has presented at technology conferences such as DEF CON, H.O.P.E., and Interz0ne. He has been very outspoken about many topics, many of which have gotten some negative feedback from different sources. His most controversial article was entitled \\"Hacking google Adwords\\" at DefCon13 which drew criticism from such people as Jason Calacanis. among others. His presentation at the fifth H.O.P.E. conference drew some surprise from the AS/400 community. StankDawg appeared as a subject on the television show The Most Extreme on Animal Planet where he demonstrated the vulnerabilities of wireless internet connections. Blake chose the handle \\"StankDawg\\" in college, where he started a local hacking group which became known as the \\"Digital DawgPound\\". Digital DawgPound The Digital DawgPound (more commonly referred to as the \\"DDP\\") is a group of hackers, best known for a series of articles in hacker magazines such as 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and Make, the long-running webcast Binary Revolution Radio, and a very active set of forums with posts from high-profile hackers such as Strom Carlson, decoder, Phiber Optik and many more. The stated mission of the DDP is to propagate a more positive image of hackers than the negative mass media stereotype. The group welcomes new members who want to learn about hacking, and attempts to teach them more positive aspects and steer them away from the negative aspects by reinforcing the hacker ethic. Their goal is to show that hackers can, and regularly do, make positive contributions not only to technology, but to society as a whole. =History= The DDP was founded and named by StankDawg. His stated reasons were that he had made many friends in the hacking scene and thought that it would be useful to have everyone begin working together in a more organized fashion. He was motivated by the fact that there had been other well-known Hacker Groups in the 1980s who had accomplished great things in the hacking world such as the LoD and the MoD. In 1988, while a junior in high school, StankDawg came up with the name on his way to the \\"Sweet 16\\" computer programming competition. He jokingly referred to his teammates as \\"The Digital Dawgpound\\". StankDawg lurked in the shadows of the hacking world for many years throughout college under many different pseudonyms. In 1997 he popped his head out into the public and began becoming more active on IRC and many smaller hacking forums. He saw some people who he thought were insanely brilliant individuals who seemed to have the same mindset and positive attitude towards hacking that he did so he decided to approach a couple of them to see if anyone would be interested in forming a group and working together. There was always a huge emphasis not only on technical competence and variety, but also on strength of character and integrity. The team was a mix of hackers, programmers, phone phreakers, security professionals, and artists. They had experience in multiple programming languages and operating systems. DDP members are not only good programmers and hackers, but more importantly, good people. By 1999 the DDP had its first official members and from this partnership, creativity flowed. The DDP communicated and worked together on StankDawg's personal site, which was open to anyone who wanted to join in on the fun. StankDawg was never comfortable with the fact that it was his name that was on the domain and that many people who were coming to the site were coming because of his articles or presentations but not really appreciating all of the other great contributions from other community members that were around. In 2002, after watching the web site grow quickly, it was decided that a new community needed to be created for these like-minded hackers who were gathering. This was the start of the biggest DDP project called Binary Revolution which was an attempt at starting a true \\"community\\" of hackers. As the site grew, so did the DDP roster. =Members= Over the years, DDP membership has included several staff writers for 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and Blacklisted! 411 magazine including StankDawg and bland_inquisitor. They frequently publish articles, provide content, and appear on many media sources across the global Interweb. DDP members are also regular speakers at hacking conferences such as DEF CON, H.O.P.E., Interzone, Notacon, and many more smaller and more regional cons. Some DDP members hold memberships in Mensa and the International High IQ society. StankDawg is very proud of the diversity of the team and has spoken to this many times on Binary Revolution Radio. Members are from both coasts of the United States to Europe and have even had members from Jamaica, Brazil, and many other countries. =Recognition= The DDP maintains a blog \\"which they refer to as a \\"blawg\\" (Obviously a play on the intentionally misspelled word \\"Dawg\\"). Posts by DDP members have been featured on other technology-related sites such as those of Make Magazine, HackADay, Hacked Gadgets, and others. Binary Revolution In 2003, StankDawg moved the forums from his personal site over to a new site as part of a project called the Binary Revolution which he considered a \\"movement\\" towards a more positive hacking community. This \\"Binary Revolution\\" is the best known of the DDP projects and is commonly referred to simply as \\"BinRev\\". This project was created in an attempt to bring the hacking community back together, working towards a common, positive goal of reclaiming the name of hackers. The Binary Revolution emphasizes positive aspects of hacking and projects that help society. It does this in a variety of outlets including monthly meetings, the weekly radio show Binary Revolution Radio(BRR), a video-based series of shows called HackTV, and very active message board forums. BinRev is more than just a radio show or forums, although they are certainly the most well-known of the projects. It is actually composed of many parts. =Binary Revolution Radio= Binary Revolution Radio, often shortened to \\"BRR\\", was one part of the binrev community. Started and hosted by Blake in 2003, it featured different co-hosts each week, and covered different aspects of hacker culture and computer security. It was broadcast via internet stream, usually prerecorded in Florida on a weekend, and then edited and released on the following Tuesday, on the DDP Hack Radio stream at 9:30pm EST. Topics included phreaking, identity theft, cryptography, operating systems, programming languages, free and open source software, wi-fi and bluetooth, social engineering, cyberculture, and information about various hacker conventions such as PhreakNIC, ShmooCon, H.O.P.E., and Def Con. In July 2005 Blake announced that he was going to take a break, and so for the third season, the show was produced by Black Ratchet and Strom Carlson (who had been frequent co-hosts during Blake's run). During the time that they hosted the program, the format rotated between the standard prerecorded format, and a live format which included phone calls from listeners. Blake returned to the show in May 2006. He maintained the prerecorded format, and brought more community input into the show, by bringing on more members of the Binary Revolution community. For the first episode of the fourth season, BRR had its first ever broadcast in front of live audience during the HOPE 6 convention in New York City, June 2006.HOPE Number Six The final episode, #200, took place on October 30, 2007, with a marathon episode which clocked in at 7 hours and 12 minutes.

Those places that did have meetings were sparse on information. Binary Revolution meetings were started as an answer to these problems and as a place for our forum members to get together. BinRev meetings offer free web hosting for all meetings to help organize the meetings and keep communications alive and to help projects to grow. Some meetings are in large cities like Chicago and Orlando while others are in small towns. Anyone can start their own BinRev meeting by asking in the BinRev forums. =BinRev.net= \\"BRnet\\" is the official IRC network of Binary Revolution. It is active at all hours of the day and contains a general #binrev channel but also contains many other channels for more specific and productive discussion. =HackTV= In the middle of 2003, he released an Internet video show entitled \\"HackTV\\" which was the first internet television show about hacking, and which has grown into a series of several different shows. They were released irregularly since most of the episodes were filmed by StankDawg in South Florida where he lived at the time. They wanted the show to appear professional in terms of quality, but this made cooperating over the internet difficult. Sharing large video files was difficult and encoded video caused editing problems and quality concerns. The original show was released as full-length 30 minute episodes. This was also a problem since it because more and more difficult to get enough material for full-length episodes. There was also some content that was related to hacking only on a fringe level and StankDawg did not feel it was appropriate to include in the show. This led to other ideas. HackTV:Underground In light of the difficulties of putting together the full HackTV original show, and in an attempt to make the show more accessible for community contributions, StankDawg launched a new series that was less focused on format and video quality that focused more on content and ease of participation. This series was titled \\"HackTV:Underground\\" or \\"HTV:U\\" for short. This series allowed anyone to contribute content in any format and at any length or video quality. The allowed people to film things with basic cameraphone quality video if this was the only way to get the content. One episode of HackTV:U was used by G4techTV show called \\"Torrent\\". HackTV:Pwned This series of HackTV was a prank style show, similar to the popular \\"Punk'd\\" show on MTV at the time. Even the logo is an obvious parody of the Punk'd logo. This series contains pranks that mostly took place at conferences, but is also open to social engineering and other light-hearted content. =DocDroppers= The DocDroppers project is a community project to create a centralized place to store hacking articles and information while still maintaining some formatting and readability. Old ascii text files existed scattered across the internet but they come and go quickly and are difficult to find. They are usually formatted with the very basics and sometimes difficult to read. DocDroppers allows users to submit articles to a centralized place where they can be searchable, easily maintained, and easy to read and reference. Recently, this project has grown to include encyclopedia style entries on many hacking topics after many were deleted from sites such as Wikipedia. This has caused DocDroppers to include a section on hacker history and culture among its content.

He worked for The New Yorker for almost 30 years, and wrote numerous essays and several books. He is best known for his long essay on television and its effect on American culture, \\"Within the Context of No Context,\\" first published in The New Yorker on November 17, 1980, and later published as a book.The beginning of the essay is available at The New Yorker website. This was one of the few times that the magazine devoted its central section to one piece of writing.Other pieces given this honor were \\"Hiroshima\\" by John Hersey in the August 31, 1946, issue; the three articles that formed the basis of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in the June 16, 23 and 30 issues of 1962; three articles that were the basis of The Fate of the Earth by Jonathan Schell, in the February 1, 8 and 15 issues of 1982; and an article on the massacre of the inhabitants of El Mozote, El Salvador, by Mark Danner, in the December 6, 1993, issue. Life and career Trow was born in an upper-middle-class family in Greenwich, Connecticut, the son of Anne (n√©e Carter; 1918‚Äì2010) and George William Swift Trow (1916‚Äì1997).https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/obituaries/01trow.html His father was a newspaperman. His great-great paternal grandfather, John Fowler Trow (1810‚Äì1886), was a New York-based publisher who is known today was the namesake of New York City directories. Trow studied at Phillips Exeter Academy, and graduated from Harvard University in 1965. There, he was president of The Harvard Lampoon. He later served as an editor for its offshoot, the National Lampoon, working with young humorists like Michael O'Donoghue, Henry Beard, and Douglas Kenney. He served on active duty in the U.S. Coast Guard.Hertzberg, Hendrik. \\"The Talk of the Town: Postscript: Swift\\" The New Yorker December 11, 2006 (82:41), p. 42, 44 In 1966, Trow took a position at The New Yorker, writing articles for the magazine, especially in the section \\"The Talk of the Town,\\" and contributing short fiction. He worked under editors William Shawn (1951‚Äì1987) and Robert Gottlieb (1987‚Äì1992), whom he saw as mentors. In 1994, when new editor Tina Brown invited Roseanne Barr to oversee a special issue on women, Trow quit the magazine in protest. He abandoned the house he was building in Germantown, New York, and traveled around North America, living in Texas, Alaska, and Newfoundland. Several years before his death, he moved to Naples, Italy. In 2006 he died there, alone, having secluded himself for a decade. Trow was socially ambitious: throughout his life, he was \\"striving to be part of the '10 percent of people at Harvard who wear tuxedos to their own little events in their own little buildings and you can see them out on their balconies with their tuxedos and their often very beautiful girls who are also similarly there from the Vanderbilts and the Astors.'\\"Levy, Ariel. \\"The Last Gentleman\\", New York Magazine, March 26, 2007, quoting close friend Jacob Brackman. Writing Throughout his career, Trow analyzed mainstream American cultural institutions to understand how the culture had changed from the newspaper-reading, eastern Establishment- dominated world of his childhood in the 1940s and early 1950s, to the ahistorical, tabloid sensibility born in the Jazz Age and propagated by television. The appeal and value of Trow's work can be difficult to communicate, because the style \\"in its very essence resists summary. Summary, of course, flees from detail, whereas for Trow the details are the notes without which there is no song.\\" Birkerts, Sven. ‚ÄúAfter the Fall‚Äù, The Atlantic January 21, 1999. Some critics have found Trow's works impenetrable and elitist; some argue that Trow's nostalgia for the pre-television era was misplaced, because the subsequent civil rights movements had made American culture more democratic.\\"The failure of Trow's essay [Within the Context of No Context] is its failure to note the following: The old boys club had to be blown up. It had to be. And if it had to be, then the resulting world, a world of more equalized life chances and stiffer competition, would of course result in less continuity, more yuppie striving, and a more vulgarized pop culture.\\" Metcalf, Stephen. Within the Context of WASP Context: Assessing the legacy of George W. S. Trow, Slate, December 8, 2006 =Essays= \\"Within the Context of No Context\\", which was edited by New Yorker editor William Shawn, was published in book form in 1981 accompanied by Trow's profile of music mogul Ahmet Erteg√ºn. In 1997, \\"No Context\\" was reprinted with a new introductory essay, \\"Collapsing Dominant\\". In \\"No Context\\", Trow pointed out the role of television in the destruction of American public culture and Americans' sense of history. \\"Middle-distance\\" institutions that had long given Americans' lives real contexts (such as fraternal organizations, bowling leagues, and women's clubs), had disappeared as people stayed home to watch television. Their replacements, television shows, were false contexts designed to be just compelling enough to keep people watching. What remained as real contexts for Americans to live in were \\"the grid of two hundred million\\" (the U.S. population at the time) and \\"the grid of intimacy\\" (the immediate family). Celebrities had a real life in both grids, and only they could now be complete. Deprived of real context, everyone else now wanted to be celebrities themselves. Trow argued that as marketers segmented the viewers into demographically defined groups, and pitched advertisements and shows to particular niches, viewers for the first time learned to see themselves as part of an age-related demographic group rather than as part of a linear flow of people from the past into the future. In consequence, demography had replaced history as the default context for understanding the world. Things were now valued not on an absolute scale, but by discovering if one was in tune with one's group. Trow illustrates this point with a reference to Family Feud, where a contestant was asked to guess \\"what a poll of a hundred people had guessed would be the height of the average American woman. Guess what they guessed. Guess what they guessed the average is.\\"Trow, George W. S. Within the Context of No Context (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1997), p. 88 \\"No Context\\" ends with a narrative memoir of Trow's experiences working two summers as a guide at the 1964 New York World's Fair. His summary of the Fair: \\"At the Fair, one could see the world of television impersonating the world of history.‚ÄùContext, p. 116. In an obituary for Trow, the novelist and screenwriter Michael Tolkin is quoted as saying that \\"No Context\\" is no longer fashionable because \\"It's not a polemic for change. It's just a cold description of where things are going. There aren't many books that are unafraid to be that negative.\\" In his essay \\"The Harvard Black Rock Forest,\\" Trow criticizes another mainstream American institution, Harvard University (which he had attended). The Black Rock Forest, 50 miles north of New York City along the Hudson River, had been donated to Harvard as a nature preserve for scientific studies. Trow writes about the Harvard administration's indifference to the property except as a profit opportunity, and its eventual rescue and dedication to educational nature studies. In addition to his nonfiction, Trow also wrote casuals for The New Yorker, many of which were \\"subtle to the point of unintelligibility\\", according to Ben Yagoda. =Memoir= A memoir, My Pilgrim's Progress: Media Studies, 1950‚Äì1998, analyzes the cultural world of the United States in the 1950s, at the transitional time when television began to take over American culture. The book is written in a conversational style, sometimes transcribed from audiotapes. Trow \\"swirls\\" between pop and mainstream cultural icons, such as Doris Day, Alfred Hitchcock, Elvis Presley, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The book cover has a photograph of President Eisenhower, whom Trow admired as \\"the guy of guys\\". Trow asserts that the models of masculine adulthood presented to his generation by the official mass culture were so out of date or irrelevant that being in/on/with television (and adopting an ironic attitude to one's self) was the only possible choice. Some reviewers were put off by the book's haughtiness, elitism, or repeated statements of authority, e.g. \\"You'll have to trust me on that one.\\"For example, Marzorati, Gerald. \\"Still No Context,\\" New York Times Magazine, February 14, 1999. According to a close friend, Trow was \\"extremely upset\\" by the critical reception of Progress.Bernhard, Brendan. \\"A Death In Naples: Appreciation\\" New York Sun, March 6, 2007. After that, he only published one known article, a critique of television news anchor Dan Rather.\\"Is Dan Mad? The Mind of an Anchorman\\" (c. 1998) =Novel= Trow's only novel, The City in the Mist, (1984) did not impress critics. They were put off by its minimalist style and lack of plot, narrative momentum or involving characters. The book, which moves from the mid-19th century to the present, tracks the energy in three intertwined families, from the masculine vitality of a thuggish Irish immigrant to the weak flame of his elderly bachelor grandson, who lives on his income in two rooms in New York City, and spends his time caring for his clothes and going out into what remains of Society. The central concerns of the novel ‚Äì the decline of masculine energy and the replacement of masculine social authority by feminine social authority ‚Äì Trow later addresses explicitly in My Pilgrim's Progress.

He competed in the men's 5000 metres at the 1960 Summer Olympics. Beatty moved to Charlotte, North Carolina with his family when he was four years old. He grew up in the Dilworth neighborhood, delivering for the Charlotte Observer with his trusted dog \\"Trigger\\" for five years. Then focused on boxing, young Beatty would run his paper route to help him train. During the last meet of his junior year in high school, Beatty convinced his coach to let him run the mile event. His speed was discovered in that race, as he went on to win. In the course of a month, he went from never running in a race before, to winning a state championship in the mile.

The Arakan forest turtle is a semiterrestrial turtle, meaning it can survive in aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats, but as adults, they prefer living in terrestrial habitats.  Taxonomy  Illustration from 1878 Geo√´myda depressa was the scientific name proposed by Anderson in 1875 who described a zoological specimen collected in Arakan.  Characteristics  The Arakan forest turtle has 18 plastral annuli, a carapace length of and weighs .  Distribution and habitat  In 2009, the Arakan forest turtles was discovered in Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range in Myanmar. The scientific team also labeled the area as a good prospective place to focus conservation efforts for the turtle, despite the fact that locals do occasionally hunt and eat them. Even with those activities, this protected area is difficult to access and lacks any human settlement, making any human interference with the turtle merely opportunistic. No large-scale commercial project hunts the turtle, nor would there be a demand for one, since the turtle is too difficult to find compared to the little profit there is for doing so. Furthermore, the area even has a low risk of being exploited for natural resources.  Behaviour and ecology  The Arakan forest turtle is active at night and increases its activity during the early wet season. Local hunters found eggs in June and July when skinning female specimens, possibly revealing the reproductive system and cycle of the species. It remains dormant the majority of the time and hides in leaves and debris. It is an omnivore, feeding on both animals and plants. Although it is considered a relatively reserved animal for the majority of its daily activity, it is aggressive when it comes to eating insects, worms, and fish. It also consumes fruit that falls to the forest floor.  Threats  Arakan forest turtles are being traded by animal pet dealers in China, who catch them in western Myanmar. In 2003, researchers took samples for research from nine Arakan forest turtles that had been imported to the Czech Republic to be kept in a private collection. ReferencesRobbins, R. G., and Steven G.

Early life  Bacon was born in Barnstable, Massachusetts, and his family was one of the prominent, politically active Boston Brahmin families. His father, Gaspar G. Bacon, was on the board of Harvard University, and later, in the 1930s, served as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. Born to a life of privilege and wealth, David Bacon attended Deerfield Academy and graduated from Harvard in 1937. He summered with his family at Woods Hole on Cape Cod, where he became involved during the early 1930s with the \\"University Players,\\" at West Falmouth. There he met then unknown performers James Stewart and Henry Fonda, with whom he later shared accommodations while he struggled to establish himself.  Career  Bacon's acting career failed to progress, and he drifted for several years. He moved to New York City, where he was sponsored by a wealthy British patron, and although he once again failed to secure employment, he began to wear expensive clothes and jewelry, leading to speculation that he was acting as a gigolo. He moved to Los Angeles, where he met and married Austrian singer and actress Greta Keller, eleven years his senior, in 1942. In her later years, Keller disclosed that Bacon was homosexual, and that she was lesbian, and that their lavender marriage partly served as what she referred to as a \\"beard\\", allowing both of them to maintain the requisite facade in Hollywood, where they were both attempting to establish film careers. In 1942, Howard Hughes met Bacon, and signed him to an exclusive contract, with the intention of casting him in The Outlaw (1943) as Billy the Kid. Bacon screen tested for the role and was found unsuitable. Though Hughes later decided not to use Bacon in The Outlaw, replacing him with actor Jack Beutel, he kept Bacon to the terms of his contract, casting him in several smaller roles, usually as college boys. Keller alleged that there was a homosexual relationship between Hughes and Bacon, and she blamed the alleged relationship for Bacon's being replaced. Hughes, however, was widely known as a womanizer and was often the target of unscrupulous claims to cash in on his money. Later, Hughes did lend Bacon for a role in the Republic serial The Masked Marvel (1943). The serial was produced with a low budget, and marked a low point in Bacon's career, with Keller recalling that he was completely humiliated. Today it remains his best remembered work.  Death  On September 12, 1943, Bacon was seen driving a car erratically in Santa Monica, California, before running off the road and into the curb. Several witnesses saw him climb out of the car and stagger briefly before collapsing. As they approached he asked them to help him, but he died before he could say anything more. A small puncture wound was found in his back; the weapon had punctured his lung and caused his death. A weapon was never found, though the wound was suggested to be from a stiletto. Keller, who was then five months pregnant, collapsed when she heard of her husband's death. She was inconsolable and was given sedatives by Bacon's brother, a doctor. On September 20, eight days after Bacon's death, Keller went into labor and delivered a stillborn. When he died, Bacon was wearing only a swimsuit, and a wallet and camera were found in his car. Also in his car was a small sweater not belonging to Bacon. Allegedly, the film from the camera was developed and found to contain only one image, that of Bacon, nude and smiling on a beach. There is no proof of the existence of this photo, however, and it is believed to be a rumor long built into the story as fact. The case attracted publicity for a time and remains unsolved. David Bacon was cremated at Cunningham & O'Connor Mortuary in Santa Monica. His cremains were shipped to Massachusetts where they were interred at Woods Hole Village Cemetery (also known as Church of the Messiah Memorial Garden) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

Palmarola. The Pontine Islands (, also ; ) are an archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the west coast of Italy. The islands were collectively named after the largest island in the group, Ponza. The other islands in the archipelago are Palmarola, Zannone, and Gavi to the northwest, Ventotene and Santo Stefano to the southeast. These two groups are separated by . From Sabaudia-Cape Circeo peninsula to Zannone the distance is , while Ventotene faces Gaeta (21 miles). The minimum distance between Santo Stefano and the isle of Ischia is . The archipelago is volcanic and has been inhabited for thousands of years. Neolithic artifacts and Bronze Age obsidians have been excavated on the islands. The islands were used by the Etruscans who carved the \\"Blue Grottos\\". The earliest recorded history of the islands occurs with the Roman victory over the Volsci at 338 BC. According to a local legend, this was once the lost Kingdom of Tyrrhenia which sank with a narrow strip connected to mainland Italy. During the reign of Rome's Caesar Augustus, residential expansion on the islands was encouraged and people spread from Ponza to Ventotene. Rome used the two islands as a retreat and a place to exile politically troubling citizens. Some two thousands years later the islands were used for the same reason by the Fascist regime. Agrippina the Younger, mother to the future Roman emperor, Nero, was exiled to the Pontine Islands by her brother, the then Roman emperor, Caligula, in 39 AD, before having the exile lifted by her uncle, the emperor Claudius upon his succession. Deposed Pope Silverius was exiled there in 537 shortly before his death. The Pontine were abandoned during the Middle Ages after raids by Saracens and pirates. During the 18th century, the Kingdom of Naples re- colonized the islands, and they later became part of the Kingdom of Italy. Ponza and Ventotene are populated, but the smaller islands are not, with total population of archipelago at 4,066 inhabitants as of 2009. Ventotene and Santo Stefano are land and sea conservation areas supervised by the Italian State. Currently, tiny vineyards, wild herbs and flowers, and secluded beaches and grottos make them a popular tourist destination.

Criteria Today, the Philippine Legion of Honor is conferred upon a Filipino or foreign citizen in recognition of valuable and meritorious service in relation to the military affairs of the Republic of the Philippines. It is thus the primary order of military merit of the Republic of the Philippines. To signify the importance of the civil service in military affairs in the preservation of the honor of the Republic of the Philippines and in nation building, the Philippine Legion of Honor is conferred on the anniversary of the declaration of Philippine Independence. The Philippine Legion of Honor may be awarded by the Secretary of National Defense in the name and by authority of the President of the Philippines.

Lord Vishnu's Temple Vishnupad Mandir is situated on the bank of Phalgu river. Course Phalgu River at Gaya in winter The Phalgu is formed by the confluence, some below Bodh Gaya, of the Lilajan (also called Niranjan or Nilanjan) and the Mohana, two large hill streams each of which is over wide. The Phalgu is also mentioned as Niranjan. The united stream flows on to the north past the town of Gaya, where it attains a breadth of over . The Phalgu here passes by a high rocky bank, on the steep sides of which are many paved stairs leading down to the river bed, while high above are the Vishnupad Mandir, with many minor shrines around it. It then runs in a north-easterly direction for about , and opposite the Barabar hills it again takes the name of Mohana, and divides into two branches which eventually flow into a branch of the Punpun. The Phalgu like its confluent streams, Lilajan and Mohana, is subject to high floods during the monsoons but in other seasons of the year it dwindles to a stream wandering through a wide expanse of sand. Religious significance =History= Women performing Chhath Puja in the river Phalgu in Gaya The portion of the course of the Phalgu flowing by Gaya is sacred to the Hindus. It is the first holy site visited by the pilgrim and here his first offering must be made for the souls of his ancestors. According to the Gaya Mahatmya, which forms part of the Vayu Purana, the Phalgu is the embodiment of Vishnu himself. One tradition states that it formerly flowed with milk. According to Hindu belief, the soul wanders after death until pindadan, or religious service seeking salvation for the dead from the cycle of rebirth, is performed. The fortnight-long pitrapaksh period is considered auspicious to offer pindadan. The 15 days of the waning moon during the Hindu month of Ashvin are known as pitrapaksh. Pindadan is traditionally offered on the banks of the Phalgu at Gaya. It is mandatory for Hindu devotees offering pindadan to shave their heads and take a holy dip and head for the Baitarni pond. The prayers are performed at the Vishnupad Mandir. Priests, known as Gaywal- pandas, conduct the ritual. Thousands of Hindus visit Gaya for the purpose of pindadan. =Hinduism= There is reference to the city of Gaya and the Phalgu in the Ramayana in which it says that Sita had cursed the Phalgu River. There is an interesting story and the purana states that on account of this curse, the Phalgu lost its water, and the river is simply a vast stretch of sand dunes. According to history, in the absence of Rama, his wife Sita offered pinda on its banks to Dasharatha father of Rama. The story goes that Rama, along with his brothers and Sita, came to Gaya to perform the sacred rites for his father, Dasaratha. When the brothers were bathing in the river, Sita was sitting on the banks, playing with the sand. Suddenly, Dasaratha appeared out of the sand, and asked for the Pindam, saying he was hungry. Sita asked him to wait till his sons returned, so that she could give him the traditional Pindam of rice and til. He refused to wait, asking her to give him pindams made of the sand in her hand. Having no other option, she gave him the Pindam he desired with five witnesses ‚Äì the Akshaya Vatam, the Falguni River, a cow, a Tulsi plant and a Brahmin. Soon, Rama returned and started the rituals. In those days apparently, the ancestors would arrive in person to collect their share, and when Dasaratha did not appear, they wondered why. Sita then told them what had happened, but Rama could not believe that his father would accept pindams made of sand. Sita now mentioned her witnesses, and asked them to tell Rama the truth. Among the five, only the Akshaya Vatam took her side and told the truth, while the others lied, trying to take Rama‚Äôs side. In her anger, Sita cursed all of them thus: the Falguni river henceforth would have no water at Gaya; the Cow would no longer be worshipped from the front as all others are- only its backside would be worshipped; there would be no more Tulsi plants at Gaya and the Gaya Brahmins would never be satisfied, they would always be hungry and crave more and more. She then blessed the Akshaya Vatam saying that all who came to Gaya would perform the Pinda pradaanam at the Akshaya Vatam too. =Buddhism= Before attaining Enlightenment, the prince SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama practiced asceticism for six years (ten or twelve years according to some accounts) on the banks of the river, residing in a forest near the village of UruvilvƒÅ. After realizing that strict asceticism would not lead to Enlightenment, he recuperated after bathing in the river and receiving a bowl of milk-rice from the milkmaid SujƒÅtƒÅ. He sat under the nearby pippala tree, where he finally achieved Enlightenment. This tree became known as the Bodhi Tree, and the site became known as Bodh GayƒÅ.

Before his retirement, Ihde was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. In 2013 Ihde received the Golden Eurydice Award. Ihde is the author of over twenty original books and the editor of many others. Ihde lectures and gives seminars internationally and some of his books and articles have appeared in a dozen languages.  Major concepts and thoughts  =Bodies in cyberspace= Ihde's work Bodies in Technology spells out the original exploration of the ways cyberspace affects the human experience. The book explores embodiment in cyberspace with references to human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI) research. The main question of the book is the meaning of bodies in technology. Ihde rejects Cartesian dualism. Even to have an out of body experience is to have an implicit 'here-body' from which we experience an 'object-body' over there. He has further explored these arguments in his book Bodies in Technology. Beginning with a \\"phenomenology of multistability\\" in the way various \\"technological media\\" are perceived, Ihde examines the \\"roles of human embodiment, perception, and spatial transformations within communication and information media.\\"http://www.ifs.tu- darmstadt.de/fileadmin/gradkoll/Publikationen/space-folder/pdf/Ihde.pdf Ihde argues that movies like the Matrix trilogy play upon fantasy in a technological context and relate to the human sense of embodiment. He stresses an important fact that we have to experience the embodiment where we live, rather than to \\"plugin\\" to a technofantasies world. =Technoscience= The study of technoscience examines cutting-edge work in the fields of the philosophies of science and technology, and science studies; it also emphasizes the roles of our material cultures and expertise. According to Ihde, science and technology are in a symbiotic relationship, where scientific research relies fully on the development of scientific instruments, the technological development. In a paper \\"Was Heidegger prescient concerning Technoscience?\\", Ihde re-examines Martin Heidegger's philosophy of science with a reappraisal of what was innovative, and what remained archaic. Heidegger then is read against the background of the \\"new\\" approaches to science in science studies, and against the background of the scientific revolutions which have occurred since the mid-20th century.Ihde, D (2001) Was Heidegger Prescient Concerning Technoscience? Existentia 11 (3-4):373-386 = Material and expanding hermeneutics = Ihde has introduced the concept of material hermeneutics, which characterises much practice within the domains of technoscience. He rejects the vestigial Diltheyan division between the humanistic and natural sciences and argues that certain types of critical interpretation, broadly hermeneutic, characterize both sets of disciplines. He examines what he calls a style of interpretation based in material practices relating to imaging technologies which have given rise to the visual hermeneutics in technoscience studies. With references to science studies, sociology of science and feminist critique of science, Ihde have present the idea of expanding hermeneutics, that emphasises praxis, instruments and laboratories over theoretical work. He claims that in science, the instruments and technologies used operate in hermeneutic way.\\"Material Hermeneutics\\" , presented at \\"A Symmetrical Archaeology, TAG 2005\\" symposium. =Philosophers in 'R&D;'= Ihde has argued on numerous occasions that \\"if the philosopher is to play a more important role it must not be only in or limited to the Hemingway role. Rather, it should take place in the equivalent of the officers' strategy meeting, before the battle takes shape. I will call this the 'R&D; role'\\".Ihde, D (1999) Technology and Prognostic Predicaments, AI & Soc (1999) 13:44-51, Springer-Verlag London Philosophers should engage themselves on interdisciplinary research teams and actively participate in research and development work.Ihde, D (1999) Technology and Prognostic Predicaments, AI & Soc (1999) 13:44-51, Springer-Verlag London He has claimed that only by having philosophers in the R&D; labs they can have truly new and emerging technologies that are philosophically engaged.Ihde, D (2012) Can continental philosophy deal with the new technologies?

Santo Stefano () is an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the west coast of Italy, and part of the Pontine Islands. It has a circular shape, is less than in diameter, and is located east from the nearby island of Ventotene. Overview Like the rest of the archipelago, the island was created by volcanic activity. It is dominated by an old prison built by the Bourbons, completed in 1797 and in use until 1965. It has 99 cells around a central watchtower. Built for 600 inmates, it had 800 in 1817 (and 400 on Ventotene). People imprisoned included Carmine Crocco, the most important brigand during the Italian unification, and the anarchist Gaetano Bresci, who killed King Umberto I in 1900. He was imprisoned there for a year before being found hanged in his cell. During the Fascist regime, other prisoners were the future President of Italy Sandro Pertini, Umberto Terracini, Giorgio Amendola, Lelio Basso, Mauro Scoccimarro, Giuseppe Romita, Altiero Spinelli and Ernesto Rossi. In October 1860, part of the Bourbon troops left the island for the siege of Gaeta. During a revolt, some Camorra prisoners proclaimed the Republic of Santo Stefano. The prisoners legislated a statute and remained autonomous until January 1861, when a Navy contingent recovered the island. The island has been uninhabited since the closure of the prison, except for tourists that visit by boat during the day. The island has had several names, such as Partenope, Palmosa, Dommo Stephane and Borca since Roman times. The island was put up for sale in 2012 for the price of ‚Ç¨20,000,000.rightmove.co.uk This did not include the prison. Wildlife This island once harbored an endemic lizard, the Santo Stefano Lizard (Podarcis sicula sanctistephani). It became extinct in 1965, probably due to feral cats and a snake species.David Day, 1981, The Doomsday Book of Animals, Ebury Press, London.

He was closely associated with the creation of Scouting and the popular look of Boy Scouts in France and Belgium, comparable to the American artist Norman Rockwell. Biography Pierre Joubert was born in Paris. Joubert was a young Scout himself, and attended the √âcole des Arts Appliqu√©s in Paris. His first amateur drawings appeared in Scouts de France in 1926. He graduated to the magazine L'Illustration in 1927 through 1934, but continued increasingly to focus on Scout-centered art in Scouting publications. Joubert also was an illustrator of calendars, handbooks, boys' adventure novels, particularly the Signe de Piste (Trail Sign) line (where he worked with Ren√© Follet). The style of Joubert's illustrations depicted idealized boys experiencing the glories of Scouting and comradeship. Joubert is considered, owing to his eye for trend and his mass-market exposure, to have had reflective influence on boy-culture in France from the 1930s until the close of the 1960s. He made the comic book Gribouille, Scout (1935) and two books of the Pouf series. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/j/joubert_pierre.htm Joubert had his controversial side; in the 1940s, the Nazis banned all French Scouting but through Vichy; thus, Joubert worked with Vichy and has been tarred with \\"collaboration.\\" He also did work for some right-wing Catholic journals and, as with any artist, the particulars of his patrons have been imputed to him. Not long before his death, Joubert produced a large volume of memoirs and reprinted art, Souvenirs en vrac. He died in La Rochelle at age 91.

It should not be confused with hardness, which is a measure of a sample's resistance to indentation or scratching. It is an important property for welding, since it is inversely proportional to weldability, that is, the ease of welding a material. When a hot steel work-piece is quenched, the area in contact with the water immediately cools and its temperature equilibrates with the quenching medium. The inner depths of the material however, do not cool so rapidly, and in work-pieces that are large, the cooling rate may be slow enough to allow the austenite to transform fully into a structure other than martensite or bainite. This results in a work-piece that does not have the same crystal structure throughout its entire depth; with a softer core and harder \\"shell\\". The softer core is some combination of ferrite and cementite, such as pearlite. The hardenability of ferrous alloys, i.e. steels, is a function of the carbon content and other alloying elements and the grain size of the austenite. The relative importance of the various alloying elements is calculated by finding the equivalent carbon content of the material. The fluid used for quenching the material influences the cooling rate due to varying thermal conductivities and specific heats. Substances like brine and water cool the steel much more quickly than oil or air. If the fluid is agitated cooling occurs even more quickly. The geometry of the part also affects the cooling rate: of two samples of equal volume, the one with higher surface area will cool faster. The hardenability of a ferrous alloy is measured by a Jominy test: a round metal bar of standard size (indicated in the top image) is transformed to 100% austenite through heat treatment, and is then quenched on one end with room-temperature water. The cooling rate will be highest at the end being quenched, and will decrease as distance from the end increases. Subsequent to cooling a flat surface is ground on the test piece and the hardenability is then found by measuring the hardness along the bar. The farther away from the quenched end that the hardness extends, the higher the hardenability. This information is plotted on a hardenability graph.ASTM A255-10, Standard Test Methods for Determining Hardenability of Steel, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA. The Jominy end-quench test was invented by Walter E. Jominy (1893-1976) and A.L. Boegehold,W.E. Jominy & A.L. Boegehold, \\"A Hardenability Test for Carburizing Steel,\\" Trans.

It was introduced in France in 1992 but is based on a Canadian empirical model developed and widely used since 1976.  Description  The index is a whole number that ranges between 0 and 20 in France and up to above 30 in Canada. It is computed from five components. The first three components are numeric ratings of the moisture content of litter and other fine fuels, the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth, and the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers. The last two components are the rate of fire spread if fuel is available for combustion, and the frontal fire intensity. The essential information needed to calculate this index is: * the humidity of the air at the beginning of the afternoon (when it has its lowest value); * the temperature in the middle of the afternoon (when it has its highest value); * the 24-hour total precipitation (from noon to noon); * the maximum speed of the average wind.  Usages  = Australia = The FWI was adapted for use in Australia, with large FWI values most commonly associated with high wind speeds, followed secondly by low relative humidities and then thirdly by high temperatures. = France = This index is computed for 40 zones of France, three are in the Landes (d√©partement with the biggest forest of France). M√©t√©o France sends the IFM to civil defense authorities, which allows the prepositioning of men and vehicles, especially air units.

The document was inspired by the Bottom-Up Review that was also performed by the DoD. The general theme for the first NPR was to lead and hedge threats from abroad. The review was organized around six areas of focus: Role of nuclear weapons, nuclear force structure, nuclear force options, nuclear safety and security, and relationship between US nuclear posture, counter-proliferation policy and threat reduction policy with the former Soviet Union. This review was led by a group of five members, headed by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear security and Counterproliferation Ashton Carter and Major General John Admire. Owing to the differences in experiences between the two chairs of the review, this led to internal conflict as the NPR was being worked through.Admire, John H. \\"MEMORANDUM FOR THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR NUCLEAR SECURITY AND COUNTERPROLIFERATION\\", United States Department of Defense. 1994-01-07.Admire, John H., Carter, Ashton \\"MEMORANDUM FOR NPR STEERING GROUP\\", United States Assistant Secretary of Defense. 1994-01-10.

The final report is National Security Classified and submitted to the Congress of the United States. The 2002 Nuclear Posture Review also included components requiring the \\"Pentagon to draft contingency plans for the use of nuclear weapons against at least seven countries, naming not only Russia and the \\"axis of evil\\"‚ÄîIraq, Iran, and North Korea‚Äîbut also China, Libya and Syria.\\"WILLIAM M. ARKIN: ‚ÄúSecret Plan Outlines the Unthinkable‚Äù - Los Angeles Times of March 10, 2002 (via Internet Archive) Only portions of the report have been released, such as the foreword for the 2002 NPR. In this report, there is a proposal for a new US nuclear triad based on: offensive strike systems, defenses, and a revitalized defense structure.Donald H. Rumsfield, Department of Defense \\"Nuclear Posture Review Report: Forward,\\" 2002. The NPR also calls for the development of new types of nuclear weapons, as well as retaining 2000 deployed strategic nuclear weapons. Critics have argued that this does the opposite of hedging against global threats and inadvertently promotes nuclear proliferation. = 2010 NPR = President Barack Obama's 2010 Nuclear Posture Review was preceded by high expectations because of his 2009 speech in Prague, Czech Republic where he prominently outlined a vision of a world without nuclear weapons. His NPR was hoped by observers to make concrete moves toward this goal. The finished 2010 policy renounces development of any new nuclear weapons such as the bunker-busters proposed by the Bush administration, and for the first time rules out a nuclear attack against non-nuclear-weapon states who are in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This rule specifically excludes Iran and North Korea. As part of the implementation of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, the US Government is reviewing its nuclear deterrence requirements and nuclear plans to ensure that they are aligned to address today's threats. Rose Gottemoeller, US Acting Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, said in early June 2012 that the United States was considering what forces the United States needed to maintain for strategic stability and deterrence, including extended deterrence and assurance to US Allies and partners. Based on this analysis the United States would develop proposals for potential further reductions in its nuclear stockpile. = 2018 NPR = With Donald Trump's election came a new nuclear posture review headed by Secretary of Defense James Mattis. The 2018 NPR maintains the need for a nuclear triad in the US defense strategy. There are a variety of options that have been proposed by the 2018 NPR. One of the statements made include a need to close a gap in the nuclear arsenal with low- yield nuclear weapons. This suggests that the US would consider using nuclear weapons if necessary on a smaller-scale regional conflict rather than all-out nuclear war. Other things to note from the 2018 NPR include a need to develop sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) to bolster the SSBN portion of the triad. The review also states the US's intention to not ratify the CTBT and rejects the idea of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Despite these recommendations and stances, the 2018 NPR is argued to be similar rather than different from previous NPRs. The NPR maintains that nuclear weapons are still meant to serve as a deterrent, which is the goal of these proposed actions to modernize the US nuclear arsenal.

Vesuvianite occurs as tetragonal crystals in skarn deposits and limestones that have been subjected to contact metamorphism. It was first discovered within included blocks or adjacent to lavas on Mount Vesuvius, hence its name. Attractive-looking crystals are sometimes cut as gemstones. Localities which have yielded fine crystallized specimens include Mount Vesuvius and the Ala Valley near Turin, Piedmont. The specific gravity is 3.4 and the Mohs hardness is . The name \\"vesuvianite\\" was given by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1795, because fine crystals of the mineral are found at Vesuvius; these are brown in color and occur in the ejected limestone blocks of Monte Somma. Several other names were applied to this species, one of which, \\"idocrase\\" by Ren√© Just Ha√ºy in 1796, is now in common use. A sky bluish variety known as cyprine has been reported from Franklin, New Jersey and other locations; the blue is due to impurities of copper in a complex calcium aluminum sorosilicate. Californite is a name sometimes used for jade-like vesuvianite, also known as California jade, American jade or Vesuvianite jade. Xanthite is a manganese rich variety.

He was a highly decorated World War II fighter pilot who served in both the RCAF and the U.S. Army Air Corps. 18 months after joining the U.S. Army Air Corps, at 26 years of age, Benedict achieved the rank of Major and was made Squadron Commander. He is best known for being the first man to land an aircraft on the North Pole. Early life Benedict joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in July 1940. After training, he was sent to Great Britain where he flew Spitfires, and was later transferred to North Africa. In March 1942 he was assigned to 127 Squadron RAF. He was shot down on July 16, 1942, while flying a Hurricane, but parachuted to safety. On December 14, 1942, Benedict transferred to the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he flew Curtiss P-40s and later P-47 Thunderbolts. He returned to the U.S. on leave and married his Canadian fianc√©e on January 7, 1945. He then returned to Europe for the remainder of the war. Landing at North Pole Wanting the Air Force to get credit for the first landing on the North Pole, General Old, Commander of the Alaskan Air Command, asked Major Benedict to take what he needed and command the first flight to land on the North Pole. The historic landing was accomplished on May 3, 1952 in a U.S. Air Force C-47 modified with skis. Readings taken by the scientists accompanying Benedict and his crew verified that they were the first men to set foot on the exact geographical North Pole. Post-Air Force years Benedict retired from the Air Force in 1962 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He then worked as a firefighting pilot in California where he was killed in a plane crash on August 31, 1974 while flying a Grumman F7F Tigercat dropping fire retardant in the Ukiah area.

Geography The Hoher Mei√üner is densely forested and covers an area of 10 km by 5 km. It is located approximately between Eschwege and Grossalmerode as well as Bad Sooden- Allendorf and Waldkappel. Together with large parts of the Kaufungen Forest and the Soehre forest it forms the very extensive Naturpark Mei√üner-Kaufunger Wald. Geology In the Tertiary period the area was covered by thick forests. From these forests, lignite deposits were formed, which were then covered by sand and lava. The basalt formations have been eroded by weathering and were much higher at one time. Geomorphology =Highest mountain in northeast Hesse= The Mei√üner peak is not the highest point in northern Hesse, even if it is commonly held to be. In northwest Hesse lie some mountains which are substantially higher. Therefore, the Kasseler crest, with an elevation of 753.6 m, is the highest peak in northeast Hesse, but not in all of Hesse. =Mountains= View from the Kalbe in winter *Kasseler Kuppe (753.6 m) *Kasseler Stein (748 m) *Kalbe (720 m) *Heiligenberg am Mei√üner (583 m) *B√ºhlchen am Mei√üner (537 m) Lookout points From different locations on the Mei√üner one can enjoy wonderful views: * Kalbe: From this basalt crest, approximately 720 m high, there are views of the Werra Valley (\\"Werratal\\") and the Eichsfeld-Hainich-Werratal nature park. One can also see the Harz Mountains, the Thuringian Forest and the Rh√∂n Mountains. This lookout point can only be reached on foot - e.g. by the path which begins at the Mother Hulda Pond (German: Frau-Holle-Teich). * Schwalbenthal: This spot is easier to reach than the ‚ÄûKalbe,‚Äú but the views are hardly less attractive; it lies about 100 m lower, at a fork in the road, slightly below the \\"Stinksteinwand.\\" Here there is a parking lot (elevation 620 m) with splendid views of Mei√üner- Vockerode, and, in the distance, Thuringia. * Mei√ünerhaus: Views from the southwest side of the mountain include, among other things, the ranges of the Kellerwald, the Habichtswald and the Kaufunger Wald.  Mining  The lignite mining industry began around 1560, after gloss coal bits were discovered in a brook, and persisted until 1929. The coal was used, for example, as fuel for salt production in Bad Sooden Allendorf and at the large power station in Kassel. * Stinksteinwand and Schwalbenthal: Striking evidence of the centuries-long practice of mining on the Mei√üner is given by the so-called Stinksteinwand (\\"stinking stone wall\\"), located above Schwalbenthal on the east face of the mountain. In former times coal was extracted there, by sub- surface mining. This coal was prone to spontaneous combustion, and for centuries people on the surface have seen and smelled the smoke from the smoldering fires in the subterranean coal seams. Even in recent times all attempts to extinguish these fires have failed, so that one can often notice a sulfur-like smell  sometimes quite strong  at the Schwalbenthal parking lot or beyond. Slightly below the Stinksteinwand lies the Gasthaus Schwalbenthal inn, the last remaining building in a mining industry settlement of about 10 houses, demolished because of the danger of landslides. * Bransrode: Bransrode, on the northwest side of the mountain massif, is the site of the last sub-surface coal mine in the area, which was closed in 1929. Immediately thereafter, the quarrying of basalt began, which continued until 2003. * Kalbe (former open pit mine): From 1949 to 1974 lignite coal was mined at Kalbe. Since then, the former mine has filled with water which is up to 30 m deep and which has a surface area of 20,000 m¬≤. The pit's impressive basalt shelves rise above the lake. In order to access the coal seams, the basalt over it had to be removed. It was dumped down the mountain slope, where it formed piles which can be seen today.

To the west is Dundrum, to the east is Blackrock, to the south is Sandyford, and to the north Ranelagh. Nature Goatstown is primarily a residential area, with extensive housing developments from the middle decades of the 20th century onwards, with little local industry. It is roughly centred on a pub named the Goat Grill, at the intersection of Goatstown Road and Taney Road, where there has been a pub since the early 18th century. Etymology Goatstown got its name from the fact that formerly goats were bred there; in the 19th century it was popular to travel to Dundrum and nearby Goatstown as goat's milk was considered to be excellent for those suffering from tuberculosis. Transport A number of roads pass through Goatstown. At the crossroads the R112 passes from west (Taney Road) to east (Mount Anville Road), to the south is the R825 (Goatstown Road) and to the north is the R133 (Lower Kilmacud Road). A short distance from the crossroads is a T-junction where the R826 terminates at the R112 on the Taney Road. The Luas green line runs through the southwest corner of Goatstown and the Dundrum Luas stop is nearby, with the vehicular entrance off Taney Road. The bus routes of the 11, 11a and 75 run through Goatstown as well, linking Goatstown to the city centre, D√∫n Laoghaire and Tallaght. Development To the east of the Goatstown Road lies former allotment land, much of which was compulsorily purchased during the 1960s for the proposed Eastern Bypass / Saint Helen's link road. A portion of this land is currently being built on by D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council, to provide social and affordable housing. A Georgian house and remaining surrounding land, known as Trimbleston, was sold in the early 1990s to builders Sorohan Brothers. The house was subsequently damaged in two fires and the remaining ruins demolished and replaced by a housing and apartment development, also called Trimbleston. Phase two of Trimbleston has recently commenced with the demolition of five two-storey houses on Goatstown Road and construction of 202 dwelling units in their place and on land to the east owned by the Sorohans. Notable people William Dargan lived for a time in Mount Anville House in Goatstown.

They appeared in various classic Mexican films and made many appearances on nationally syndicated programs in Mexico and the United States.  Formation  The band was formed in 1960 in Linares, Nuevo Le√≥n by Homero Guerrero. The idea of the name \\"Cadetes\\" came from the fact that, as a child, Guerrero's dream was to attend a military academy. However, because of his family's financial problems, he decided to devote himself to music. He began playing a bajo sexto, singing at family parties, festivals, schools and in the main square of Linares. In 1961 Guerrero added an accordionist, Adan Moreno. They began playing around Linares, and became known as Los Cadetes de Linares. In 1967 Moreno left the band due to disagreements with the group. In 1968 Samuel Zapata became the group's second accordionist. Homero and Samuel made their first recordings for Discos del Valle, a record company from Houston, Texas. Their early singles included \\"S√°came, S√°came\\", \\"El Ranchero\\", \\"El Rog√≥n\\", \\"Estoy Pagando\\", and \\"Quiero Que Sepas\\". Zapata left the group for family reasons in 1968. In late 1968 Candelario Villareal joined as the third accordionist for the band. Homero and Candelario made local performances throughout Monterrey, Linares, and southern Texas. The band subsequently added Lupe Tijerina. Guerrero and Tijerina made a recording in 1974 with of corrido composed by Lupe Tijerina called \\"Los Dos Amigos\\". The band subsequently began touring across Mexico and the southwestern United States, as well as places such as Chicago and Los Angeles with large Mexican communities. With the addition of Lupe Tijerina's style, the band began to find chart success. The band's hits in this era included \\"Dos Coronas a mi Madre\\", \\"Las Tres Tumbas\\", \\"Pueblito\\", \\"Regalo de Reyes\\", and \\"Polvo Maldito\\". On February 19, 1982, Guerrero died in a car accident on the road from Monterrey to Reynosa. His funeral was attended by thousands of people.  Later years  After Guerrero's death, Rosendo Cantu took his place in the group. Lupe Tijerina had success with Cadetes de Linares in that same year with his bolero, \\"Adi√≥s Amigo Del Alma\\". Cantu and Tijerina played sold out stadiums and appeared on Siempre en Domingo and the Johnny Canales Show. The band broke up later on, but Cantu, seeing that Los Cadetes de Linares's contract had ended with Ramex Records, applied and bought the legal rights to perform as the authentic Cadetes de Linares, instead of Tijerina. Cantu and Tijerina both formed their own bands. Eventually, after litigation over the name at the USPTO, Ramex Records ended up owning the trademark \\"Los Cadetes de Linares\\". The label later sold the trademark to Zamic Records of Houston, Texas. Many bands subsequently formed with the name \\"Cadetes de Linares\\", to Tijerina's irritation. Tijerina died from respiratory problems shortly after performing the opening song at a concert in Ciudad Fern√°ndez, San Luis Potos√≠ on July 5, 2016.

(Source: United States Geological Survey.) The vadose zone, also termed the unsaturated zone, is the part of Earth between the land surface and the top of the phreatic zone, the position at which the groundwater (the water in the soil's pores) is at atmospheric pressure (\\"vadose\\" is from the Latin word for \\"shallow\\"). Hence, the vadose zone extends from the top of the ground surface to the water table. Water in the vadose zone has a pressure head less than atmospheric pressure, and is retained by a combination of adhesion (funiculary groundwater), and capillary action (capillary groundwater). If the vadose zone envelops soil, the water contained therein is termed soil moisture. In fine grained soils, capillary action can cause the pores of the soil to be fully saturated above the water table at a pressure less than atmospheric. The vadose zone does not include the area that is still saturated above the water table, often referred to as the capillary fringe. Freeze, R.A. and Cherry, J.A., 1979. Groundwater. Englewood Cliffs, NJ, Printice-Hall Inc., 604 p. Movement of water within the vadose zone is studied within soil physics and hydrology, particularly hydrogeology, and is of importance to agriculture, contaminant transport, and flood control. The Richards equation is often used to mathematically describe the flow of water, which is based partially on Darcy's law. Groundwater recharge, which is an important process that refills aquifers, generally occurs through the vadose zone from precipitation. In hydrology The sharp contact between the vadose zone (brown oxidized mudstone) and the underlying phreatic zone (grey unoxidized mudstone) exposed at a construction site. The vadose zone is the undersaturated portion of the subsurface that lies above the groundwater table. The soil and rock in the vadose zone are not fully saturated with water; that is, the pores within them contain air as well as water. In some places, the vadose zone is absent, as is common where there are lakes and marshes, and in some places, it is hundreds of meters thick, as is common in arid regions. Unlike the aquifers of the underlying water-saturated phreatic zone, the vadose zone is not a source of readily available water for human consumption. It is of great importance in providing water and nutrients that are vital to the biosphere, however, and it is intensively used for the cultivation of plants, construction of buildings, and disposal of waste. The vadose zone is often the main factor controlling water movement from the land surface to the aquifer. Thus it strongly affects the rate of aquifer recharge and is critical for the use and management of groundwater. Flow rates and chemical reactions in the vadose zone also control whether, where, and how fast contaminants enter groundwater supplies. Understanding of vadose-zone processes is therefore crucial in determining the amount and quality of groundwater that is available for human use.US Geological Survey, Office of Groundwater In speleology In speleology, cave passages formed in the vadose zone tend to be canyon-like in shape, as the water dissolves bedrock on the floor of the passage.Caves & Caving: Glossary Passages created in completely water-filled conditions are called phreatic passages and tend to be circular in cross-section.New Mexico: Bureau of Mines & Mining Bulletin 117 (Part I: Discussion of Deposits and Events)  See also   *  References   Further reading    Hydrogeology Soil physics ","title":"Vadose zone"},{"id":"1834889","text":"Count Andrzej Hieronim Franciszek Zamoyski (12 February 1716 - 10 February 1792) was a Polish noble (szlachcic).

In the year 1412 the area was called \\"Goetze\\" after the family name of the owners. After Louise Henriette acquired the land 1651, she leased the area of Zehlendorf to the town Oranienburg. One-hundred-twenty-four years later, in 1775, Zehlendorf became its own town. In the year 1819 the Prussian state leased the property Zehlendorf to Ernst Friedrich William Kienitz, the mayor of the town Friedrichsthal. In the year 1826 Zehlendorf was freed from the lease. In 1901 a railway station, Heidekrautbahn was opened, which led from Berlin to Liebenwalde. In the year 1927 the property was sold to the \\"German Society for Internal Colonization\\" headquartered in Berlin. This sale was part of a settlement with the local farmers, who had lost land due to the mining of clay and metal in order to supply Germania-Klinkerwerk.

It was the first game in the Zork trilogy and was released for a wide range of computer systems, followed by Zork II and Zork III. It was Infocom's first game, and sold 378,000 copies by 1986. Gameplay The game takes place in the Zork calendar year 948 GUE (although the passage of time is not notable in gameplay). The player steps into the deliberately vague role of an \\"adventurer\\". The game begins near a white house in a small, self-contained area. Although the player is given little instruction, the house provides an obvious point of interest. When the player enters the house, it yields a number of intriguing objects, including a brass, battery-powered lantern, an empty trophy case, and an Elvish sword of great antiquity. Beneath the rug a trap door leads down into a dark cellar, which is revealed to be one of several entrances to a vast subterranean land known as the Great Underground Empire. The player soon encounters a colorful host of dangerous enemies, including deadly grues who only prey on their victims in the dark, an axe- wielding troll, a giant cyclops who flees in terror at the mention of Odysseus, a vampire bat that can drop the player anywhere in the mine if encountered, evil spirits guarding the Entrance to Hades, and a nimble- fingered thief armed with a stiletto who makes mapping the maze difficult by removing or scattering any items that the player might drop to leave a trail. The ultimate goal of Zork I is to collect the Twenty Treasures of Zork and install them in the trophy case. Finding the treasures requires solving a variety of puzzles such as the navigation of two complex mazes and some intricate manipulations at Flood Control Dam #3. Placing all of the treasures into the trophy case scores the player 350 points and grants the rank of \\"Master Adventurer.\\" An ancient map with further instructions then magically appears in the trophy case. These instructions provide access to a stone barrow. The entrance to the barrow is the end of Zork I and the beginning of Zork II. There are 28 ways for the player to die. It is possible to score all 350 points in 223 moves (and win the game completely in 228 moves) by exploiting a bug. Notes Screenshot of Zork I running on Gargoyle, a modern interpreter The opening text of Zork I is among the most notable descriptions in video games: :\`West of House\` :\`You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.\` :\`There is a small mailbox here.\` Zork I introduced the grue, a \\"sinister, lurking presence\\" that kills adventurers who go exploring in the dark. Grues appeared (or, at least, were mentioned) in many subsequent Infocom adventures, right up to the 1997 graphic adventure Zork Grand Inquisitor, published by Activision. Reception Zork being played on a Kaypro computer. Zork Is sales surprised Infocom by rising, not falling, over time. Computer dealers demonstrated its parser to customers as example of what their products could do. They sold the game as an essential accessory to those purchasing new computers, including the DEC Rainbow, TI Professional, and others that most people did not see as game machines. It was the best-selling game of 1982, with 32,000 copies sold by the first half of that year; almost 100,000 copies in 1983,‚ÄîInc. reported that the game had been a best seller for four years‚Äîmore than 150,000 copies in 1984, comprising more than 20% of Infocom's sales that year; and a total of 378,987 copies by 1986.

BYTE declared in 1981 that \\"No single advance in the science of Adventure has been as bold and exciting\\" as Zork.

Zork can be felt and touched‚Äîexperienced, if you will‚Äîthrough the care and attention to detail the authors have rendered.\\" It concluded, \\"Somebody, please, let me know when [the sequel is] done.\\" Jerry Pournelle wrote in the magazine in 1983 that he played the game with his sons, stating that \\"If you liked Adventure and wanted more after you solved the Colossal Cave, I guarantee you'll love Zork\\". Jon Mishcon reviewed Zork in The Space Gamer No. 40. Mishcon commented that \\"Other than the absence of graphics, this game has no weak points I can find. Although [the price] is expensive I believe this is a first rate game and well worth every penny.\\" 80 Micro called Zork \\"complicated and sophisticated ... a joy to play\\". It praised the documentation (\\"Take it from a rank amateur; these instructions are clear and easy to follow\\"), and wondered if the game could be solved because \\"the program lets you do pretty much what you want to do, even if the consequences are much less than desirable, it leaves open marvelous opportunities\\". The magazine concluded by hoping that \\"we can expect a second part sometime soon\\". Deirdre L. Maloy reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, stating that \\"Zork is a program that is worth the money for anyone even mildly interested in adventure games. Those that like puzzles will have their fill, I'm sure. Master adventurers will even take a while on this one\\". The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the game an overall A+ rating, calling it \\"THE definitive adventure game\\". In 1992, Computer Gaming World added Zork I to its Hall of Fame, waiving the normal criteria \\"in favor of honoring this venerable classic.\\" In 1996, the magazine listed Zork I at #13 among the top 150 best games of all-time. The editors wrote, \\"This seminal Infocom text adventure combined challenging puzzles, wonderful descriptive prose, and a touch of humor to create a rich universe that existed not in SVGA graphics, but within your head.\\" On March 12, 2007, The New York Times reported that it was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon. The Library of Congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list, including Zork. Legacy Zork I was one of five Infocom games that were re-released in Solid Gold format with in-game hints. Infocom allowed the distribution of the early Fortran version, therefore source code is available. Various Public domain software ports are available in various repositories.The DUNGEON (Zork I) source on github.com/devshane/zorkdungeon-3.2A.tar.Z (05-Oct-1994) on the Interactive Fiction Archive \\"Dungeon version 3.2A, 1-Oct-94; contains all the rooms and puzzles of the original MIT Zork. DEC FORTRAN source code by Robert M. Supnik; see dungn32b.zip for a port to DOS.\\" There is also an abridged version, called Mini-Zork I, dated November 24, 1987. Mini-Zork was released free of charge as a promotion. A German language version was developed, but never released. An unfinished version of this story file, dated January 13, 1988, has made its way into public circulation. The German is evidently non- native, containing many spelling and grammar errors. It is known that Jeff O'Neill worked on this version. A remastered version of was first released by Japanese software development company SystemSoft for the NEC PC-9801 in March 1991. There are differences in this enhanced remake: the game recognizes verb commands typed in kana (Japanese syllable system) or Latin alphabet. For convenience, some of the most common verb commands (Look, Take, etc.) can be accessed by pressing a corresponding button, but the player still has to type the name of an object. This remake also helps the player to interact with the environment by displaying a list of objects after the player has typed a command. Also, unlike the original, the remake contains enhanced graphics, especially in the list of objects on which the text is superimposed. Another remastered version was released by Activision and Shoeisha in Japan for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1996. This version also includes graphics (with the interfaces of Lucasfilm's and Legend's early entries in particular), sound effects, auto-mapping, and music by Yuzo Koshiro. Neither version was ever released outside Japan. The game is playable in Call of Duty: Black Ops with the code \\"ZORK\\". To do this, Mason (the main character) needs to get up from the chair. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users need to pull L2 and R2 (LT and RT on Xbox 360) rapidly. Windows players need to press the spacebar rapidly and Wii players must shake the controls (Wiimote + nunchuck control scheme). After Mason gets up from his chair, he must walk to the left and use the old computer, which is behind the chair. To play Zork, type \\"zork\\" into the command prompt. An achievement/trophy is also awarded for putting in the code. Zork is referenced in the 2011 novel Ready Player One. In order to acquire the Jade Key, a \\"gunter\\" must successfully complete the game and blow on a Cap'n Crunch whistle to obtain a copy of the key. The opening of Zork is referred to with the clue, \\"a dwelling long neglected\\". Zork is not featured in the 2018 film version.

Mauretania Caesariensis (Latin for \\"Caesarean Mauretania\\") was a Roman province located in what is now Algeria in the Maghreb. The full name refers to its capital Caesarea Mauretaniae (modern Cherchell). The province had been part of the Kingdom of Mauretania and named for the Mauri people who lived there. Formerly an independent kingdom, and later a client state of Rome, it was annexed into the Empire formally during the reign of Claudius and divided into two provinces about 42 AD. A third province, named Mauretania Sitifensis, was later split off from the eastern portion during the reign of Diocletian in 293 AD. During and after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, most of the hinterland area was lost, first to the Vandal Kingdom and later to the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, with Roman administration limited to the capital of Caesarea. The land was reconquered by Rome during the reign of Justinian. In the late 580s, under the emperor Maurice, all of the Maghreb was granted to the Exarchate of Africa, and Mauretania Caesariensis became part of a new province, Mauretania Prima. The Muslim conquest of the Maghreb brought an end to Roman rule in Mauretania, which became ruled by the Umayyad Caliphate as part of Medieval Muslim Algeria.  History  The Roman Empire in the time of Hadrian (ruled 117‚Äì138), showing the imperial province of Mauretania Caesariensis (roughly modern Algeria, in the Maghreb) In the middle of 1st century AD, Roman emperor Claudius divided the westernmost Roman province in Africa, named Mauretania (land of the Mauri people, hence the word Moors), into Mauretania Caesariensis (named after its capital, one of many cities simply named Caesarea after the imperial cognomen that had become a title) and Mauretania Tingitana. Mauretania Caesariensis included eight colonies founded by the Emperor Augustus : Cartennas, Gunugu, Igilgili, Rusguniae, Rusazu, Saldae, Zuccabar, Tubusuctu; two by the Emperor Claudius: Caesarea formerly the capital of Juba, who gave it this name in honour of his patron Augustus, and Oppidum Novum; one by the Emperor Nerva: Setifis; and in later times, Arsenaria, Bida, Siga, Aquae Calidae, Quiza Xenitana, Rusucurru, Auzia, Gilva, Icosium and Tipasa in all 21 well-known colonies, besides several municipia and oppida Latina. Under Diocletian's Tetrarchy reform, the easternmost part was broken off from Mauretania Caesariensis as a separate small province, Mauretania Sitifensis, called after its inland capital Sitifis (now S√©tif) with a significant port at Saldae (presently B√©ja√Øa). Map of Mauretania Sitifensis (in blue color) & Mauretania Caesariensis (in light brown color) At the time of Diocletian and Constantine the Great, both Sitifensis and Caesariensis were assigned to the administrative Diocese of Africa, in the praetorian prefecture of Italy, while Tingitana was an outpost of the Diocese of Spain. After the fall of the Western part of the Roman Empire, a Germanic Vandal Kingdom was founded, but the remaining Eastern Empire (now known to historians as the Byzantine Empire) recaptured the area around 533, but most of Mauretania Caesariensis remained under the control of local Moorish rulers such as Mastigas, and it was not until the 560s and 570s that Byzantine control was established in the interior. During the reign of Maurice, the empire was reorganized and a number of Exarchates were founded, among them the Exarchate of Africa which included Mauretania, among other territories. Mauretania Sitifensis was re-merged back into this province, and was granted the name \\"Mauretania Prima\\". The Muslim conquest of the Maghreb for the caliphate under the Umayyad dynasty meant the end of the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa and Late Antique Roman culture there and Mauretania Caesariensis became part of the westernmost Islamic province called Maghreb.  Economy  The principal exports from Caesariensis were purple dyes and valuable woods; and the Amazigh or Mauri were highly regarded by the Romans as soldiers, especially light cavalry. They produced one of Trajan's best generals, Lusius Quietus, and the emperor Macrinus.  Religion  Caesarea was a major center of Judaism before 330, and Sitifis was one of the centres of the soldier cult of Mithraic mysteries. Christianity spread throughout in the 4th and 5th centuries. Among the ruling class, Trinitarian Christianity was replaced by Arianism under the Germanic kingdom of the Vandals, which was established in 430, when the Vandals crossed the Strait of Gibraltar. = Episcopal sees = Ancient episcopal sees of Mauretania Caesariensis listed in the Annuario Pontificio as titular sees:Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), \\"Sedi titolari\\", pp. 819-1013  See also  Notitia Dignitatum * Pauly-Wissowa  References  = Sources = Westermann, Gro√üer Atlas zur Weltgschichte (in German) Roman provinces in Africa Ancient Algeria Late Roman provinces Provinces of the Byzantine Empire States and territories established in the 40s 40s establishments in the Roman Empire 7th-century disestablishments in the Exarchate of Africa ","title":"Mauretania Caesariensis"},{"id":"1834907","text":"Jeremy Harrison (born January 29, 1978) is a Canadian provincial politician who is currently a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, representing the riding of Meadow Lake. Harrison is also the former Canadian Member of Parliament for the riding of Desneth√©‚ÄîMissinippi‚ÄîChurchill River, a riding that encompasses the northern half of the province of Saskatchewan. Born in Saskatoon, Harrison joined the Reform Party in 1996 and served in numerous positions in Reform, the Canadian Alliance, and the Conservative Party of Canada, including time as a political staffer in the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in Ottawa. He worked for Stephen Harper's leadership campaign in 2002, and from 2002 to 2004 he served on the national executive of the Canadian Alliance. During this time Harrison was also enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan College of Law. He graduated from that institution with a Bachelor of Law degree in the spring of 2004. He later graduated with a Master's in Public Administration from the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy. Federal politics He was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in the 2004 federal election. Harrison was defeated in the 2006 federal election by Liberal opponent Gary Merasty. On election night, the margin was 106 votes, which was reduced to 73 when election official reviewed the count sheets. He challenged the result, alleging threats and ballot stuffing by the Liberals, but a judicial recount confirmed Merasty's victory, by a reduced margin of 67 votes. On February 20, Harrison announced that he would not pursue the matter further. Harrison was cited as being part of the Conservative Party of Canada's alleged In-and-Out scheme during the 2006 election. Provincial politics Harrison was acclaimed as the Saskatchewan Party's candidate in Meadow Lake in June 2007. He was initially declared defeated in the 2007 election, narrowly losing to incumbent MLA Maynard Sonntag in Meadow Lake, but was subsequently declared elected after a count error was noted the following day. The count of absentee ballots on November 19 confirmed Harrison's victory. Following the election, Harrison was named legislative secretary to the minister of energy and resources, northern resources and oilsands development. On May 29, 2009, Premier Brad Wall appointed Harrison to the Executive Council of Saskatchewan as Minister of Municipal Affairs. On June 29, 2010, he was moved to Minister of Enterprise and Minister Responsible for Trade in a cabinet shuffle. Harrison was re- elected in the 2011 election. Following the election, he was given an additional role as Government House Leader. Harrison was dropped from cabinet in May 2012, but retained his position as Government House Leader. On June 5, 2014, Harrison returned to cabinet when appointed associate minister of the economy responsible for trade, tourism, innovation and immigration. On August 20, 2017, Harrison announced his bid for the leadership of the Saskatchewan Party just days after party leader and Premier Brad Wall announced that he was retiring from politics. However, Harrison withdrew from the race on September 1 and announced he would support another candidate, Scott Moe, who on January 27, 2018 became the 15th Premier of Saskatchewan.
