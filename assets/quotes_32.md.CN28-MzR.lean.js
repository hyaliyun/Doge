Biography  He went to primary school in Berrouaghia and Larba, and secondary school in Medea, Blida and Ben Aknoun. During this time he became a medium level leader of the Algerian Muslim Scouts (Scouts Musulmans Alg√©riens) in the Mitidja from 1943 to 1946 and then a militant of the Algerian People's Party (PPA) in 1944. From 1946 to 1953 he was a medicine student at the University of Algiers. In 1948 he became the leader of the university section of the Party of the Algerian People, a nationalist party which was arguing for independence from France. In 1949 he was one of the co- authors of the party's platform document 'L'Algerie libre vivra' (Free Algeria will live). After the so-called Berber crisis of 1949 within the PPA party, Hadjer√®s left having been involved in the crisis. He himself refused the term 'Berber' for this crisis on several occasions including in 2007 in an interview for the Soir d'Alg√©rie daily newspaper. After being a member for several years since his youth of the AEMAN he became in 1950 the president of the AEMAN (Association des √©tudiants musulmans de l'Afrique du Nord), which was the first political organisation created in North Africa. The AEMAN was created in Algiers in 1912 by Emir Khaled, the grandson of Emir Abdelkader. In 1951 Sadek Hadjer√®s joined the Algerian Communist Party (Parti Communiste Alg√©rien). He became a member of the Party Council (Conseil Consultatif) in 1952. In 1953 and 1954 he was the director of the magazine 'Progr√®s' (Progress) and became the General Advisor of the Party for the El Harrach and Mitidja East regions. That year, the Algerian War had begun on 1 November. In 1955 he became a member of the Political Bureau of the Algerian Communist Party and in December his support for the independence struggle was forced underground. He condemned in absentia to hard labour by a French court, and became national co-director of the armed organisation 'Combattants of the Liberation', which was the Algerian Communist Party's armed wing and was cooperating with the much larger nationalist guerilla force: the National Liberation Front, but without being a part of it. With his fellow communist friend Bachir Hadj Ali he negotiated in April, June, and July 1956 with the representatives of the National Liberation Front (Benyoucef Ben Khedda and Abane Ramdane) regarding the integration of the Communist troops into the FLN forces. He continued to fight within the PCA (Algerian communist party) throughout the war, until independence. After independence in July 1962, he became a member of the Secretariat of the Algerian Communist Party. In October 1962, the new president Ahmed Ben Bella banned the Communist Party which went underground. Sadek Hadjeres then became the coordinator of the Communist Party. During the Socialist Charter of Algiers of 1964 he attempted to advance the ideas of the party. From 1963 to 1965 he was a medical practitioner and medical sciences researcher. After the coup of Boumedi√®ne which ousted Ben Bella from power in 1965, he continued to operate clandestinely for the next 24 years. He was a member of the ORP (Organisation of Popular Resistance) during some of that time in the beginning, and a founding of member in 1966 of the PAGS party (Parti de l'Avant Garde Socialiste) which was a new facade for the Communist Party. The Organisation of Popular Resistance had been created by Mohamed Harbi and Hocine Zahouane, two left wing leaders of the FLN to oppose Boumedienne's coup. Hadjeres joined the ORP while other communist leaders such as Henri Alleg and Larbi Bouhali went into exile. With the leaders exiled, the ORP was weakened and the PAGS party was created the following year. In the early 70's, Boumedi√®ne undertook several leftist projects such as the Agrarian Revolution, the nationalisation of lands and factories, and other such socialist projects. President Boumedi√®ne also made Algeria closer to the Eastern bloc of the USSR and all these steps pleased indirectly Sadek Hadjeres' PAGS party which found a favourable political terrain to advance its ideas, while still remaining an opposition closely watched by the government and excluded from all official activities and subject to repression like all other opposition parties. In 1976 during the debate on the national Charter, Hadjeres led the underground PAGS briefly out of clandestinity by expressing loudly its views via student organisations such as the UNJA. This was the zenith of the communist party's political activities and influence on state affairs in Algeria according to many political commentators. With arrival of the new president Benjedid Chadli in 1979 however, and the progressive introduction of right wing policies, slow liberalisation and the introduction of the article 120 which allowed only the one party (FLN) to operate legally, Sadek Hadjeres and his PAGS party began to clash more and more with the government and the FLN. The FLN in turn looked for new support within the Islamist currents of Algerian politics. The fact the FLN supported the freedom fighters in Afghanistan combating the USSR only served to sour relations further with Sadek Hadjeres and his PAGS party. The PAGS became more and more clandestine and in 1986 voted its own expatriation due to internal disputes. Hadjeres would then assist to Eastern European Communist Party congresses and conferences, sometimes with the FLN delegation sitting only two rows away, putting the FLN in an uncomfortable position with its socialist partners from the Eastern bloc. Hadjeres entered back completely into the legal framework in 1989 with the beginning of the multi-party system in Algeria. His re-entry on the Algerian political scene occurred however at a time when the Berlin Wall was falling and his communist convictions were several shaken by the birth of a new era. His communist PAGS party was in this context severely defeated at the 1990 and 1991 elections by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and Hadjeres decided to pull out of politics in 1991. That same year Islamists began violent confrontations with the communists as their doctrines were totally opposed (Islamists were and remained convinced that Hadjeres and his communists are atheist and must be killed). The following year in 1992 several communist were assassinated by Algerian Islamists and this continued until 1994. When the government and the army cancelled the elections in 1992, they asked for Hadjeres' vocal support but he refused to give it, even he was condemned to death by several Islamist para- military and then terrorist organisations (MIA, FIDA, GIA etc...). The PAGS party ceased all activity in 1992 and Hadjeres himself left Algeria and settled in France where he undertook works as associate lecturer and researcher in geopolitics with the CRAG center of Paris 8 University (Centre de recherches et d‚Äôanalyses g√©opolitiques √† l'Universit√© de Paris VIII). He published several articles in the journal H√©rodote and gave talks at colloquiums and study conferences, as well as publishing articles in the Algerian and international press, and prepared books on the evolution of the national and social Algerian movements, starting with the PPA crisis of 1949. In 2007, the PAGS returned to the political scene under the name MDS (Democratic and Social Movement). It won one seat in the Algerian Parliament in the 17 May Algerian legislative elections. Sadek Hadjeres continues to be a very influential figure for Algerian communists and members of the MDS although he does not take part officially in any more political activities at the age of 79.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 290. Geography White Heath is located at (40.0861442, -88.5128395). It is located in Sangamon Township. History A plaque in the community center states that the area was settled by a Mr. White and a Mr. Heath. There is one school, White Heath Elementary School. Their mascot (when a junior high school and had sports) was a Warrior. The school is now part of Monticello Community District School #25. White Heath, located about 15 miles west of Champaign, IL, was platted in 1872 by James Deland at the junction point of two pioneer railroads that were constructing through the area - the Monticello Railroad (Champaign-Monticello-Decatur) and the Havana, Mason City, Lincoln & Eastern Ry through the named towns. Mr. Deland was an incorporator of the H,MC, L & E and owned property at the junction point. Being a railroad junction, it was expected White Heath could develop into a major town, but when this failed to materialize, Mr. Deland sold his land interests in the town. The two pioneer railroads were later consolidated and the lines eventually became part of the Illinois Central. The Monticello Railway Museum purchased 7 miles of the former Illinois Central Decatur and Havana District branch lines between Monticello and White Heath in July 1987. White Heath is located at the northern end of the Museum's purchase. The trackage arrangement in White Heath forms a complete \\"wye\\" which can be used to turn trains. The depot, built in 1942 to replace an earlier structure, is still standing although it is owned by a local resident and not the Museum. It is unused at present. The Decatur District (MRyM's \\"Central District\\") has been refurbished for operation at 10 mph to White Heath and is occasionally used for the Museum's \\"Railroad Days\\" event on the third weekend of September every year.

The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) initially defined this code, and gave it the description phrase \\"Moved Temporarily\\" rather than \\"Found\\". An HTTP response with this status code will additionally provide a URL in the header field Location. This is an invitation to the user agent (e.g. a web browser) to make a second, otherwise identical, request to the new URL specified in the location field. The end result is a redirection to the new URL. Many web browsers implemented this code in a manner that violated this standard, changing the request type of the new request to GET, regardless of the type employed in the original request (e.g. POST). For this reason, HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616) added the new status codes 303 and 307 to disambiguate between the two behaviours, with 303 mandating the change of request type to GET, and 307 preserving the request type as originally sent. Despite the greater clarity provided by this disambiguation, the 302 code is still employed in web frameworks to preserve compatibility with browsers that do not implement the HTTP/1.1 specification. As a consequence, RFC 7231 (the update of RFC 2616) changes the definition to allow user agents to rewrite POST to GET.

According to RFC 7231, which obsoletes RFC 2616, \\"A 303 response to a GET request indicates that the origin server does not have a representation of the target resource that can be transferred by the server over HTTP. However, the Location field value refers to a resource that is descriptive of the target resource, such that making a retrieval request on that other resource might result in a representation that is useful to recipients without implying that it represents the original target resource.\\" This status code should be used with the location header, as described below. If a server responds to a POST or other non-idempotent request with a 303 See Other response and a value for the location header, the client is expected to obtain the resource mentioned in the location header using the GET method; to trigger a request to the target resource using the same method, the server is expected to provide a 307 Temporary Redirect response. 303 See Other has been proposed as one way of responding to a request for a URI that identifies a real-world object according to Semantic Web theory (the other being the use of hash URIs).Cool URIs for the Semantic Web, see section 4 For example, if http://www.example.com/id/alice identifies a person, Alice, then it would be inappropriate for a server to respond to a GET request with 200 OK, as the server could not deliver Alice herself. Instead the server would issue a 303 See Other response which redirected to a separate URI providing a description of the person Alice. 303 See Other can be used for other purposes. For example, when building a RESTful web API that needs to return to the caller immediately but continue executing asynchronously (such as a long-lived image conversion), the web API can provide a status check URI that allows the original client who requested the conversion to check on the conversion's status. This status check web API should return 303 See Other to the caller when the task is complete, along with a URI from which to retrieve the result in the Location HTTP header field.Subbu Allamaraju.

Listing\\" lortel.org, accessed September 14, 2015 The play follows Albert Cobb, a man who once dreamed of owning a farm, becoming a plowboy. He and his wife Helen are awaiting to be reunited fifteen years after World War II, along with Larry Doyle, the man who saved his life. The title comes from when they were in the war, and Albert was staked as bait by the Germans, and Larry kept shouting \\"Who'll Save the Plowboy?\\" until he finally crept out and saved him. The Subject Was Roses premiered on Broadway on May 25, 1964 and closed on May 21, 1966.\\"The Subject WasRoses\\" ibdb.com, accessed September 14, 2015 The two-act play has been compared to Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night.McCaffrey, Lawrence J.

Taxonomy Epactionotus was first described in 1998 by Roberto E. Reis and Scott A. Schaefer, as including three species. Epactionotus is part of the tribe Otothyrini within the subfamily Hypoptopomatini. Epactionotus is sister to a clade including Eurycheilichthys, Pseudotocinclus, Microlepidogaster, Schizolecis, Otothyris, and Pseudotothyris. E. yasi was described in 2004. Species There are currently four recognized species in this genus: * Epactionotus bilineatus Reis & Schaefer, 1998 * Epactionotus gracilis Reis & Schaefer, 1998 * Epactionotus itaimbezinho Reis & Schaefer, 1998 * Epactionotus yasi Almir√≥n, Azpelicueta & Casciotta, 2004 Distribution The first three described Epactionotus species are each endemic to a very limited geographic area along the Atlantic coast of southern Brazil. E. bilineatus is endemic to the rio Maquin√©, the rio Tr√™s Forquilhas and its tributaries in Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil. E. itaimbezinho is endemic to two localities in the upper reaches of the rio Mampituba drainage, an isolated coastal stream situated along the border between Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina States, southern Brazil. E. gracilis is endemic to the Ararangu√° River drainage, an isolated coastal drainage in southern Santa Catarina State. E. yasi is only known from the arroyo Lobo, a tributary of the Iguazu River in Argentina. Description These fish are small, none surpassing SL. The head have longitudinal light-colored stripe markings which may extend onto the body over a base green color. The body is covered by bony plates except for a few areas. E. yasi is differentiated from the other species by a vent completely covered by platelets. The adipose fin is absent. The lips are small and round and form a suckermouth. Maxillary barbels are short. Odontodes are present on the head and trunk and are generally uniform in size and distribution. Ecology The habitats of most of these species are similar. These fish are found in shallow, small rivers or creeks with bottom composed of rocks, loose stones, and gravel (and may also include sand and mud) and clear water with slow to moderate current. Water is usually very cold in the austral (southern) winter. Grass or other vegetation is always present on the stream margins. The fishes are usually found on leaves and stalks of marginal vegetation, frequently adhering by means of their pelvic fins. E. yasi lives among terrestrial vegetation that falls into the water.

It is found in the Palearctic from northeast Iran to Japan and Korea.  Description  This is a large and heavy snipe 29‚Äì31 cm long with a stocky body and relatively short legs for a wader. Its upperparts, head and neck are streaked and patterned with medium brown stripes and whitish edges to the feathers forming lines down its back. The face is whitish. The breast is ginger-brown and the belly is white with brown barring on the flanks. The brown and black bill is long, straight and fairly slender. The legs and feet are yellowish- olive to yellowish-brown. All plumages are similar, but females average larger. An artist's illustration. There are two quite similar subspecies. Nominate G. s. solitaria is very widespread. The breeding range of G. s. japonica, which is richer red and less white above, is unknown, but it winters in Japan. The solitary snipe makes a hoarse kensh call as it takes off, and has a far carrying chok-a-chok-a call when displaying. The solitary snipe has a relatively slow, heavy flight. Distribution and habitat The solitary snipe breeds discontinuously in the mountains of eastern Asia, in eastern Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia. Many birds are sedentary in the high mountains, or just move downhill in hard weather, but others are migratory, wintering in northeast Iran, Pakistan, northern India, Bangladesh, eastern China, Korea, Japan and Sakhalin. Behaviour This snipe breeds in mountain bogs and river valleys above the timberline, typically from 2,400 m to 5000 m. It is often found in similar marshes and swamps at lower altitudes when not breeding or on migration. The solitary snipe builds a saucer-shaped nest of dry grass in the drier areas of its breeding wetland. The nest is concealed in a dense tuft of grass or sedges. This bird has an aerial display, which involves flying high in circles, followed by a powerful stoop during which the bird makes a \\"drumming\\" sound, caused by vibrations of modified outer tail feathers. The solitary snipe forages by pushing its long bill deep into the mud seeking invertebrates, such as insects and worms, seeds and plants. It is quite approachable, but if alarmed, it crouches, and its cryptic plumage provides effective camouflage when the bird stands motionless amongst marsh vegetation. When flushed, it drops back into the marsh after a short slow flight.

Contemporary Latin variants to his name include Ekkihardus, Eggihardus, Eggihartus, Heckihardus, Egihhartus, and Ekgihardus. ‚Äì 30 April 1002) was Margrave of Meissen from 985 until his death. He was the first margrave of the Ekkehardinger family that ruled over Meissen until the extinction of the line in 1046. Life Eckard was of noble east Thuringian stock, the eldest son of Margrave Gunther of Merseburg (d. 982). He followed his father into exile from 976 to 979 and took part in the 982 Battle of Stilo against the Emirate of Sicily, where Gunther was killed. Back in Germany, Eckard upon the death of Emperor Otto II in 983 supported his minor son King Otto III of Germany. At the Hoftag diet of Rohr in June 984, he together with Archbishop Willigis of Mainz and several German princes enforced the release of the four-year-old king by his rivaling cousin Duke Henry II of Bavaria. In 985 Otto III appointed him to succeed Margrave Rikdag in Meissen, following severe Saxon setbacks against the Slavic Lutici tribes during the Great Slav Rising. Eckard remained a vital support for the king and his mother Empress Theophanu. His military responsibilities consisted primarily of securing the Milceni lands as well as the containment of the neighbouring Polish and Bohemia duchies. Duke Boleslaus II of Bohemia had allied with Duke Henry and had taken the occasion to occupy the Albrechtsburg residence, he nevertheless had to withdraw by 987, after Eckard's forces had prevailed. According to the chronicles of Thietmar of Merseburg, he was later elected Duke of Thuringia by the magnates of the region, an event which has been taken as evidence of the principle of tribal ducal election. When Boleslaus II allied with the Lutici and entered into war with Mieszko I of Poland in 990, Margrave Eckard led the united German-Polish forces against Bohemia. Margrave Eckard had to restore Thiadric, Bishop of Prague to his see after his expulsion by Boleslaus II of Bohemia. In 996 he accompanied Otto III on his campaign to Rome, where the king was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Gregory V. Two years later, Eckard's forces helped to suppress the revolt of Crescentius the Younger in 998 by storming Castel Sant'Angelo. Eckard was high in the favour of Otto III, who rewarded him handsomely by converting many of his benefices (fiefs) into proprietas (allods). When in January 1002 Otto III died without issue and the German princes met at Frohse (today part of Sch√∂nebeck) to elect a new king, Eckard even aimed at the German crown, because the late emperor's Ottonian relative Henry of Bavaria, son of rebellious Duke Henry II, who was the preeminent candidate, met with strong opposition. Eckard was at that time the most obvious Saxon candidate, but the nobles were opposed to him.Thietmar of Merseburg records how one Saxon had taunted Eckard, saying, \\"Can't you see that your cart is missing its fourth wheel?\\" which may refer to either Eckard's seeming lack of hereditary right, although he was related distantly to the Ottonians, or to his apparent lack of self-control. They only agreed to meet again at the Kaiserpfalz of Werla and to support no candidate before then. The Werla meeting took place in April and Henry, through his cousins, Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim and Adelheid I of Quedlinburg, the sisters of deceased Otto III, succeeded in having his election confirmed, at least in part by hereditary right. Nevertheless, Eckard received enough support to commandeer the closing banquet of the Werla assembly and dine in state with Duke Bernard I of Saxony and Bishop Arnulf of Halberstadt. He was subsequently honoured as royalty by Bishop Bernward when he arrived at Hildesheim. Within days, however, he had been assassinated by agents of his Saxon opposition in P√∂hlde. Among these rivals were Count Henry III of Stade, his brother Udo, and Count Siegfried II of Northeim. Eckard was initially buried at his family's castle in Kleinjena near Naumburg, but his remains were transferred to the Benedictine monastery of Saint George in Naumburg in 1028. He was remembered by Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as decus regni, solatium patriae, comes suis, terror inimicis et per omnia perfectissimus., citing Thietmar V, 7 (5). Meissen fell into dispute on his death. Duke Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry of the Polans, who had supported Eckard for the throne, laid claim to it as his relative by marriage. Henry, now king, allotted to Boles≈Çaw the March of Lusatia (which had been attached to Meissen), but Meissen itself was granted to Gunzelin, Eckard's younger brother. Marriage and children Eckard left behind his wife Schwanehilde (Suanhild), daughter of Hermann Billung, regent of Saxony.

Survivors clung to the wreck for over a week and many people took days to die as they glimpsed the land from the sea and watched as one rescue attempt after another failed. With the loss of 89 lives, mostly due to cold and exposure, it is one of the worst maritime disasters in Australian history. Admella disaster remains the greatest loss of life in the history of European settlement in South Australia. Of the 113 on board 24 survived, including only one woman, Bridget Ledwith. Of the 89 dead, 14 were children. The 150th anniversary of the disaster was marked in August 2009 by events across the south east of South Australia and at Portland, Victoria. Description and career SS Admella (so named for her circuit Adelaide, Melbourne, Launceston) was built by Lawrence Hill and Co. at Port Glasgow, Scotland in 1857. She was an iron single screw steamer nearly 60 metres long and 8 metres at her widest and displaced about 395 tons. At the time she was one of the fastest and most luxurious ships on the Australian intercolonial trade routes. On the regular Adelaide ‚Äì Melbourne run her fastest voyage had once been made in 42 hours. In 39 voyages between Adelaide and Melbourne there had never been cause for alarm aboard Admella. Never any need for life boats or life belts. The vessel's only captain, Hugh McEwan was a cautious and capable master mariner. Admella had been built with watertight bulkheads, riveted to the hull. These were designed as a special safety feature, but were ultimately the cause of a catastrophic break up of the ship into three exposed sections in the first 15 minutes of the disaster. Final voyage Under the command of Captain Hugh McEwan Admella left Port Adelaide for what was to be her final trip early on Friday, 5 August 1859, on her usual run to Melbourne with 84 passengers and 29 crew. Her cargo consisted of 93 tons of copper, flour for the Victorian goldfields, general merchandise, and four racehorses. Due to the heavy swell, one of the horses fell over. To right it the ship changed course slightly, while the horse was put on its feet. At four o'clock next morning, when the vessel was approaching the Cape Northumberland light, the captain believed himself to be far from land. In reality, however, the ship was close to a dangerous reef at , probably from a current that carried the vessel shorewards. Suddenly she grated on a reef and, keeling over, lay broadside on to the heavy seas. An effort was made to lower the boats, but two of them were smashed and the third broke adrift. The swell lifted her further on to the reef, impelling her with such force that she lay on the summit of the ridge, with her starboard side high out of the water. In less than 15 minutes Admella broke into three parts and several passengers were washed overboard. A few rockets were found and fired in the hope of attracting the attention of lighthouse-keepers at Cape Northumberland, away, but they were damp and failed to ignite correctly. Meanwhile, those on the wreck turned their eyes to seaward for assistance. Daylight revealed a deserted coast about away interrupted by raging surf, and plans were being formulated for an attempt to reach shore when a steamer was seen in the distance. Signals were hurriedly erected on the remaining mast and rigging, and the ship's bell rung, but the vessel, Admellas sister ship Havilah, passed without seeing them. On the second day the sea was calmer and two seamen, John Leach and Robert Knapman, succeeded in reaching the shore with the aid of a raft. Exhausted, they hurried through the night to alert Cape Northumberland lighthouse. Rescue efforts The wrecked Admella, by James Shaw The lighthouse was without telegraph and so the lighthouse keeper, Ben Germein, set off to ride to Mount Gambier to telegraph authorities in Adelaide north west and Portland east. Corio left from Adelaide and Ladybird from Portland but, due to poor information, both rescue boats had difficulty locating the now desperate Admella. Meanwhile, the wreck was battered by the heavy swell. Captain McEwan shared out what little food remained and had to prevent survivors from drinking salt water, which had begun to take the lives of those who drank it. Others, exhausted by their ordeal, simply slipped into the sea to their death. In the words of one lifeboat captain they were: Over the next few days, several rescue attempts were made by Corio and Ladybird rescue boats. Rockets were fired to try to get lines aboard but mountainous seas and severe winter storms drove the rescuers back and lives were lost as the lifeboats were swamped. A further attempt was made to launch one of Admella's own lifeboats, which had washed ashore, but it too was unsuccessful. By Saturday, one full week after the wreck, Admella's lifeboat, skippered by Ben Germein and Corio's boat were launched from the beach and managed to crash through the surf and reach the wreck. Eventually three people made it onto one boat, which then capsized, drowning one man. The Portland lifeboat which had been towed to the scene by Ladybird had made an earlier attempt to reach the wreck but was driven back by the raging seas. Now it was finally successful in coming alongside the wreck and the remaining 19 survivors jumped and fell into the boat. They were transferred to Ladybird which returned to Portland. The lifeboat is now housed in the Portland Maritime Museum. Aftermath The final journey of Admella. (Click to enlarge) As news of the disaster reached Adelaide and Melbourne, interest in the wreck reached fever pitch; telegraph offices throughout the colonies were crowded, while newspapers printed extra editions only to see them sold out immediately upon release. In Adelaide, the news of the disaster brought hundreds of people to the telegraph office to hear the story as it unfolded; businesses closed and both Houses of Parliament adjourned. For a few weeks crews who had participated in the rescue were treated as heroes, especially Captain Greig and the crew of Ladybird. In the community, businesses and individuals raised money for the Admella Shipwreck Reward and Relief Fund for rescuers and survivors. After the commission of inquiry into the wreck of Admella, the loss was attributed to the effects of a current that pushed the vessel off course, although investigations were also held into a magnetic disturbance in the area that may have affected the compasses on iron-hulled ships. The commission found that a contributing factor had been the way that the watertight bulkheads had been inserted ‚Äì the holes for the hundreds of rivets had weakened the metal. The inquest also resulted in the installation of the telegraph at Cape Northumberland. The SS Admella was cited, at the time, as being a key reason why the Cape Jaffa Lighthouse was commissioned. Nearly a century later a much larger Corio was wrecked on the same reef and sank, but all aboard were rescued. Admellas wreck site is protected by the Commonwealth Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976, and is at Prior to statutory protection, some salvage work has been conducted on the wreck site over the decades, but due to its very exposed location, diving is difficult in all but the calmest of seas. In the area between the Victorian border and the River Murray mouth 101 vessels have been wrecked and 218 lives lost.

He received the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play All the Way Home. Biography =Early years= Mosel was born George Ault Mosel, Jr. in Steubenville, Ohio to George Ault Mosel, Sr. and Margaret Norman. Raised as a Presbyterian, he was eight years old when his father's wholesale grocery business failed following the stock market crash, and the family moved to the suburbs of New York City. In 1931, George, Sr. launched a successful New York advertising company. Remembering his youth in Larchmont and New Rochelle, Tad Mosel stated: :My brother and I were given a sense of security. My brother is four years older than I am. We had a good, wonderful home. I had a marvelous mother and father... I adored my mother and father. They were both wonderful parents. Mosel's interest in theater began in 1936 when he saw Katharine Cornell on Broadway in George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan. He went for one year to the Mount Hermon School in Northfield, Massachusetts, graduating from New Rochelle High School. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mosel dropped out of Amherst College to enlist in the Army. During World War II, he was a Sergeant in the U.S. Air Force Weather Service (1943‚Äì46) as a weather observer, including one year in the South Pacific. In the post-WWII years he finished at Amherst and did graduate studies at the Yale Drama School (BA), followed by a Master's at Columbia University. He was writing plays while auditioning as an actor, and in 1949 he was on Broadway in the scene- stealing, non-speaking role of a confused private in the farce, At War with the Army. =Career= His first teleplay was performed on Chevrolet Tele- Theater in 1949. During the early 1950s, he became a leading scripter for live television dramas, contributing six teleplays to Goodyear Television Playhouse (in 1953-54), two to Medallion Theatre (1953‚Äì54) and four to Playhouse 90 (1957‚Äì59). He also wrote for The Philco Television Playhouse (1954), Producers' Showcase and Studio One. After Eileen Heckart appeared in his 1953 play about a troubled marriage, The Haven (on Philco Television Playhouse), Mosel and Heckart became friends, and he wrote several scripts especially for her, including the 1953 Other People's Houses (on Goodyear Television Playhouse) about a housekeeper caring for her senile father. In 1997, Mosel recalled: :Paddy Chayefsky, Horton Foote, Sumner Locke Elliott, JP Miller and all of the group of writers that I knew, we grew up at the same time, and our eyes were on the theater. That was the Emerald City. That was the goal. Now, television came on after World War II, and television was a pauper. It had no money. No \\"self-respecting writer\\" would deign to write for television. Even drunken screenwriters wouldn't write for television. So who was there left? It was us. It was kids who would work for 65 cents. And so with a very patronizing attitude you thought, \\"Well, if I could make a few bucks doing that, it would give me time to write the great American play.\\" It didn't take too much experience to realize that television was a medium all in itself, and that it was a career all in itself, and it was a thrilling one. But we stumbled into it by being snobs if I may say so. They would give anyone a chance. I look back on it, and I think, \\"Weren't we lucky to be there?\\" Because it was pure luck that we were there... It was the stillness before you went on the air that was so dramatic because everybody would be in place in plenty of time, but everybody would be silent. Nobody talking, nobody moving the hands on the keys but not moving. The only thing moving was the second hand on the big clock, and then when it hit the top everybody started to move. It was very dramatic, that peace, that calm before you took the dive into it. It was a great thrilling moment and you suddenly loved every actor, and you just wanted them all to be rich and have children and go to happy graves. Mosel's All the Way Home premiered in New York November 30, 1960, at the Belasco Theater to critical acclaim. In addition to winning a 1961 Pulitzer Prize, the play was nominated for a Tony Award. A stage adaptation of James Agee's novel A Death in the Family, it dramatizes the reactions of a Tennessee family to the father's accidental death in the summer of 1915. The play was also performed several times on television‚Äîin 1963, 1971 and 1981. In Denmark it was known as I havn and directed for Danish television by Clara √òst√∏ in 1959. The movie adaptation of All The Way Home (1963) was filmed in the same Knoxville, Tennessee neighborhood where Agee grew up. Directed by Alex Segal, it starred Robert Preston, Jean Simmons and Pat Hingle. Mosel wrote screenplays for the films Dear Heart, starring Glenn Ford and Geraldine Page, with Mosel seen in a cameo appearance as \\"Man in Lobby\\", and the popular Up the Down Staircase, based on the novel by Bel Kaufman and starring Sandy Dennis. He also was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series for an episode of The Adams Chronicles, a PBS drama series based on the lives of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams and their families. Many of Mosel's plays for television are available for viewing at The Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles. =Personal life= Mosel's death at age 86 of esophageal cancer came after 18 years of residency at Havenwood-Heritage Heights, a Concord, New Hampshire retirement community where he often lectured. He was preceded in death in 1995 by his partner of more than 40 years, McCall's magazine graphic designer, Raymond Tatro. Legacy Mosel's US$100,000 gift to Havenwood-Heritage Heights will go to finance an auditorium, Tad's Place, for future speakers to the community.

The Group was created in Solothurn on 12 September 1982 by 120 people. Its roster has varied considerably; as of 2009 its website states that it consists of about 20,000 members or supporters, consisting largely of pacifists and anti- militarists. Means and objectives The group is politically active and spreads awareness of its cause in several ways: *using the direct democratic tools in Switzerland to propose constitutional amendments and stimulate the public debate; *practical and legal information, such as alternatives to Switzerland's mandatory military service, e.g. Swiss Civilian Service, often opted for by conscientious objectors; *media work, covering subjects such as arms equipment sales. Currently, the group focuses on the following topics: *opposition to arms trade: In 2007, the group filed enough signatures for a national initiative against arms trade. The Swiss would vote in a referendum on an amendment to the constitution that would ban the export of any weapon from Switzerland. This national referendum was held on November 29, 2009. *opposition to arms procurements, for example against the fighter jets which the Swiss army is about to purchase; *constant criticism of Switzerland's militaristic traditions. Initiatives and referendums In early 1986 the group launched its first initiative, named, in the English translation, For a Switzerland Without an Army and an Overall Peaceful Political Stance, which gathered 111,300 signatures (100,000 were required to initiate a vote). On 26 November 1989, 68.6% of eligible voters cast their ballot, resulting in 1,052,218 (35.6%) votes for the initiative. The high percentage of yes voters stunned everybody, and was interpreted as a manifestation of a remarkable loss of significance of the military in Swiss society. Although the initiative was rejected, the surprising result of the initiative influenced later reforms of Switzerland's armed forces. In Spring 1992, both chambers of the Swiss parliament decided to procure 34 F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets. Within 32 days, the GSoA gathered 503,719 signatures. Never before and never since has an initiative been submitted within such a short time or with a comparable number of signatures. Nevertheless, the Swiss people rejected the initiative on the ballot by 57% to 43%. In 1999, the GSoA assisted in collecting the 50,000 valid signatures necessary for a referendum on whether Switzerland would join the United Nations. The Swiss electorate approved this proposal in 2002. In 2001, the GSoA gathered more than 60,000 signatures for a referendum against the revised legislation regulating the structure and deployment of the armed forces. The GSoA especially opposed the option to send armed troops abroad  a concern that was shared by some right-wing traditionalists. On 10 June 2001, the revised legislation was approved by 51% of the voters. On 2 December 2001, Swiss voters considered two additional GSoA initiatives, called \\"In favor of a credible security policy and a Switzerland without an army\\" and \\"Solidarity instead of soldiers: In favor of a voluntary civilian peace service\\". In contrast to the first initiative to abolish the Swiss army, there was only sparse public debate on the issue - another topic dominated the media and the minds of the people: The September 11 attacks which occurred a few weeks before the vote took place. Both initiatives were rejected by 78% and 77% of the voters. On 21 September 2007, the GSoA submitted an initiative that required a ban on all arms exports from Switzerland. This initiative was rejected in a referendum on November 29, 2009 with 68.2% of the voters casting a no. Another initiative required stricter legislation on private possession of firearms and a stop to the Swiss tradition to store the assault rifles of each soldier at home. The initiative was supported by some 40 organisations, of which the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland, the Green Party of Switzerland and the GSoA made the largest contributions. The initiative was rejected on February 13, 2011 with 56.3% of the voters saying no. GSoA's initiative to abolish conscription was rejected by 73.2% of the Swiss electorate on September 22, 2013. In 2008 the Swiss Federal Council announced its plans to purchase a new generation of fighter aircraft. Immediately after this, the GSoA started an initiative that proposes a 10-year-moratorium for aircraft procurements. The collection of signatures was completed in May 2009.Swiss Face Fighter Vote, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 170, 25 (22 June 2009), p. 12 After guaranteeing the group that there would be a Referendum about new fighter jets the group pulled the initiative back. When the parliament decided to buy new jets 2014 it was possible to collect signatures for a referendum which is easier to win than an initiative. In the end 53% of Swiss voters decided not to buy new Gripen fighter jets on May 18, 2014. This was the first victory on the ballot for GSoA in a nationwide referendum.

Princes and territories in medieval Germany, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York, p. 165. . was a form of settlement used for the organisation of the northeastern marches of the Kingdom of Germany in the mid-10th century. Based on earlier organisations within the Frankish Empire and among the Slavs, the burgwards were composed of a central fortification (a burg) with a number of smaller, undefended villages, perhaps ten to twenty (the ward), dependent on it for protection and upon which it was dependent economically. The fortified site served as a place of refuge during attack and also as an administrative centre for tax collection, the Church, and the court system. It was given a garrison of cavalry, usually Slavic. The first burgwards (civitates or Burgen) were Merovingian and Carolingian constructions, mostly built to defend against the Saxons. An important line of burgwards lay along the Unstrut west of Merseburg, but it declined in importance in the early ninth century after the integration of the Saxons into the Frankish state. The first burgwards in Sorbian territory were founded in the 940s. Not much later they were being established among the Hevelli and around Brandenburg. There were three lines of burgwards defending eastern Thuringia. Many burgwards were controlled by monasteries, such as Hersfeld and Fulda. The burgwards were detested by the Slavs, but they were effective in their time. They converted the \\"tribute- paying peoples\\" into \\"census-paying peasants.\\" The German reverses of 983, however, doomed the burgward structure and began a new epoch of Slavic independence in the region (until the 12th century).

The list was compiled by critics Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss and generated significant attention, receiving 7.8 million hits in its first week alone. The List There are 106 films in this list with Olympia (1938), The Apu Trilogy (1955, 1956, 1959), The Godfather and The Godfather Part II (1972, 1974), and The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001‚Äì2003) each listed as single entries. These pairs and trilogies of films were directed by Leni Riefenstahl, Satyajit Ray, Francis Ford Coppola, and Peter Jackson, respectively. Martin Scorsese also had three films on the list, which were Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980), and Goodfellas (1990). Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Donen, Alfred Hitchcock, Elia Kazan, Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, Sergio Leone, Ernst Lubitsch, Kenji Mizoguchi, Yasujir≈ç Ozu, Steven Spielberg, Fran√ßois Truffaut, Billy Wilder, and William Wyler all had two films each on the list. Films on the list span a period of 80 years starting with Sherlock Jr. (1924) directed by Buster Keaton, and finishing with Finding Nemo (2003) directed by Andrew Stanton. Method Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss each independently compiled a list of 115-120 films they judged to be worthy of inclusion and then debated and weighed each choice until they agreed on the top 100. The process took about four months to complete. An effort was made to make the list as diverse as possible in terms of directors, actors, countries, and genres represented. 10 Best Soundtracks The list also included a section on the \\"10 Best Soundtracks\\" of all time, as chosen by Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss. A.R. Rahman's Roja (1992) was the only debut album in the list. Reception According to Richard Corliss, the list's web pages attracted a record 7.8 million page views in its first week, including 3.5 million on May 23, its opening day. \\"Thousands of readers have written in to cheer or challenge our selections, and thousands more have voted for their own favorites.

It is used to make an already formatted medium bootable. It will install a boot sector capable of booting the operating system into the first logical sector of the volume. Further, it will copy the principal DOS system files, that is, the DOS-BIOS (IO.SYS or IBMBIO.COM) and the DOS kernel (MSDOS.SYS or IBMDOS.COM) into the root directory of the target. Due to restrictions in the implementation of the boot loaders in the boot sector and DOS' IO system, these two files must reside in the first two directory entries and be stored at the beginning of the data area under MS-DOS and PC DOS. Depending on version, the whole files or only a varying number of sectors of the DOS-BIOS (down to only three sectors in modern issues of DOS) will have to be stored in one consecutive part. SYS will try to physically rearrange other files on the medium in order to make room for these files in their required locations. This is why SYS needs to bypass the filesystem driver in the running operating system. Other DOS derivatives such as DR-DOS do not have any such restrictions imposed by the design of the boot loaders, therefore under these systems, SYS will install a DR-DOS boot sector, which is capable of mounting the filesystem, and can then simply copy the two system files into the root directory of the target. SYS will also copy the command line shell (COMMAND.COM) into the root directory.Microsoft DOS sys command The command can be applied to hard drives and floppy disks to repair or create a boot sector. Although an article on Microsoft's website says the \`SYS\` command was introduced in MS-DOS version 2.0,SYS.COM Requirements in MS-DOS versions 2.0-6.0 this is incorrect. SYS actually existed in 86-DOS 0.3 already. According to The MS-DOS Encyclopedia, the command was licensed to IBM as part of the first version of MS-DOS, and as such it was part of MS-DOS/PC DOS from the very beginning (IBM PC DOS 1.0 and MS-DOS 1.25).

He was born in Oakland, California in 1879. He studied art at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art (now the San Francisco Art Institute), the Partington Art School (San Francisco) and with Eric Spencer Macky (1880‚Äì1958). Kelly worked for fourteen years as an illustrator for the San Francisco Examiner, and had even been a prizefighter, before he and his wife, the sculptor Kate Kelly, went to Hawaii in 1923. Their plan was to stay a year, working for an advertising agency creating material to promote tourism. They fell in love with the islands and the people and stayed permanently. Kate took a class in printmaking at the University of Hawaii with Huc-Mazelet Luquiens (1881‚Äì1961), and then taught John the techniques. John‚Äôs ravishing depictions of Polynesians was, in fact, what distinguished him from other artists in Hawaii at the time. The Kellys immediately identified with the native Hawaiians and became their champions in images and in print. John produced etchings and aquatints, primarily of human figures, though he occasionally did landscapes as well. He authored and illustrated \\"Etchings and Drawings of Hawaiians\\" in 1943, and \\"The Hula as Seen in Hawaii\\" in 1955. John Melville Kelly died in Honolulu in 1962. The Hawaii State Art Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (Kansas City, Missouri), Saint Joseph College Art Gallery (West Hartford, Connecticut) and the San Diego Museum of Art (San Diego, California) are among the public collections holding work by John Melville Kelly.

The state park is the home of Cunningham Falls, the largest cascading waterfall in Maryland, a man-made lake, and the remains of a historic iron furnace. The park is one of several protected areas occupying 50-mile-long Catoctin Mountain; it is bordered on its north by Catoctin Mountain Park and on its south by Frederick Municipal Forest. History Before the arrival of European settlers, Native Americans used the Catoctin Mountain area for hunting and fishing and also quarried it for rhyolite to make projectile points. During the 19th century, settlers began cutting the area's forests for charcoal to power the Catoctin Iron Furnace. \\"Charcoal flats\\"‚Äîsquare areas measuring approximately , cut flat into the hillsides and linked by mule trails‚Äîwere used to build charcoal kilns. The charcoal flats can still be seen in the park. Over two hundred years of abuse of the forest led to the destruction of the land. In the 1930s, after years of clearcutting for the making of charcoal, mountain farming, and timber harvesting, the land was purchased by the Federal government. Beginning in 1935, workers with the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps began constructing the Catoctin Recreational Demonstration Area to transform the area for recreational use. The site's northern portion was transferred to the National Park Service on November 14, 1936, and renamed and reorganized on July 12, 1954, as Catoctin Mountain Park. The southern were transferred to Maryland as Cunningham Falls State Park. Features View from the top of Cunningham Falls ;Waterfalls and formations Known locally, as McAfee Falls, after a family of early settlers, Cunningham Falls was apparently named after a photographer from Pen Mar Park who frequently photographed the falls. An old homestead can be seen above the falls. There is an abandoned iron mine located in the park in addition to the ruins of the third Catoctin iron furnace, owned and constructed by Jacob Kinkel, in the 1850s-1860s. Activities and amenities Recreational activities include hiking, hunting, swimming, boating, fishing, and camping. Big Hunting Creek, one of Maryland's premier trout streams, flows through the park.

It was designed by the Minnesota firm of Reed and Stem, the first architects for New York City's Grand Central Terminal in an Italianate style with red and yellow brick and ornate terra cotta detailing from lions' heads to floral figures and the NP's trademark yin-yang emblem, and its interior includes inlaid terrazzo and tiling including the same NP emblem. It was constructed in approximately three years for $112,000 and dedicated in the summer of 1902. The current facility accommodated traffic for both the main and Yellowstone Park Branch lines, and it and its predecessors thus functioned as the primary gateway to Yellowstone National Park for most of its visitors for approximately a quarter century. It served as the headquarters for the NP's Rocky Mountain division, including orders and telegraphy, and would host active rail traffic including the North Coast Limited runs. The complex combines a main building, a restaurant building, and a baggage building connected by a colonnade surrounding a courtyard facing the railroad tracks. Its shorter-lived precursors were an 1882 wooden facility, which burned down, and an 1888 brick structure, which grew to be inadequate for the rapidly increasing and somewhat affluent passenger traffic the NP was bringing to visit Yellowstone. The earliest fortunes of the Depot were tied to the fate of the railroad. Initially it was a busy connection center, sited adjacent to the large Livingston shops complex and served as an NP division headquarters, being roughly equidistant between the termini of St. Paul, Minnesota, and Seattle, Washington. Toward about World War II, rail travel to the park tapered off heavily in favor of automobile visits, and chiefly charter excursions used the Yellowstone Park line. In 1970 the NP merged with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, Great Northern Railway, and Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, forming the facility's new owner, the Burlington Northern Railroad; passenger train service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971. In 1979 Amtrak discontinued the North Coast Hiawatha in favor of the Empire Builder track on the high line, the old line of the Great Northern, and the Depot began to suffer some neglect. By the mid 1980s the BN began unsuccessfully to seek a buyer for it. Local citizens lobbied for its donation to the city and adoption by the non-profit Livingston Depot Foundation which they created for its extensive restoration and subsequent operation. Livingston Depot Center In summer of 1987 it opened as the Livingston Depot Center, operating as a museum and community center in the heart of the city, as it continues to operate today. The museum opens typically from late May to mid-September, and the facility during the off-season hosts wedding receptions, holiday parties, blues and other concerts, cards nights, historic talks, economic development forums, and similar events, and a model railroad club meets in its basement. During the Fourth of July weekend it hosts a festival of arts in the adjacent Depot Rotary Park running parallel to the train tracks. The facility also underwent a roof restoration and restabilization project from approximately 2004 to 2007.

The Catholic Church in Tonga is part of the worldwide Catholic Church under the leadership of its local bishop in communion with the Pope of Rome. It is estimated that approximately 16% of the population of the Pacific island Kingdom are Catholic, being 15,767 in 2004.1 Bishop Soane Patita Paini Mafi succeeded as Bishop of Tonga in 2008. History Prior to the arrival of European sailors and missionaries, the islands of Tonga practised an animistic Polynesian religion.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/468832/Polynesia/276584/Religion Responsibility for Oceania was given by the Catholic Church to the Society of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in 1825; but the territory was judged to be too large, and the western portion was formed into a vicariate Apostolic and given to the Society of Mary in 1836, with Mgr Jean Baptiste Pompallier (1807‚Äì1871) appointed vicar Apostolic of Western Oceania. In 1842, the vicariate Apostolic of Central Oceania was created comprising New Caledonia, Tonga, Samoa, and Fiji. A later subdivision, reduced the vicariate to include only Tonga, the Wallis Islands, Futuna, and Niu√©.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11200b.htm In 1937 the Vicariate Apostolic of Tonga Islands was created and in 1957 it became the Vicariate Apostolic of Tonga Islands and Niue and in 1966 the region became the Diocese of Tonga. The conversion to Christianity of King George Tupou I, who was the political architect of modern Tonga, had a great influence on the religious life of the Polynesian nation. Of note, the last of the Tu'i Tonga line of Tongan Kings was Catholic. This is cited as being the reason that Lapaha in Mu'a, the former capital of the Tu'i Tongan Empire, is Catholic in contrast to neighbouring Tatakamotonga, which is predominantly Methodist. Tonga sent a delegation of young people for the first time to World Youth Day 2008 when it was held in Sydney, Australia. There is no official state religion in Tonga, but around 63% of Tongans are Christian, including around 48% Protestant and 15% Catholic. There is also 18% american Mormon sect. The constitution declared Sabbath a holy day and the law restricts activities on Sundays. The Catholic Church in Tonga has accepted and included Tongan culture. As in other countries, the Catholic Church runs schooling and social services in Tonga. On 4 January 2015, Pope Francis announced his intention to appoint the present Bishop of Tonga Soane Patita Paini Mafi as a cardinal at a Papal consistory to be held on 14 February 2015.Christopher Lamb, \\"Red hats for a global Church\\", The Tablet, 8 January 2014 (Retrieved 15 January 2015) See also *Diocese of Tonga References Tonga ","title":"Catholic Church in Tonga"},{"id":"11551166","title":"WHRV"},{"id":"11551192","text":"WHRO-FM is a Public Radio broadcast radio station, broadcasting a classical music format.

A heat pump is a mechanical system that allows for the transmission of heat from one location (the \\"source\\") at a lower temperature to another location (the \\"sink\\" or \\"heat sink\\") at a higher temperature.The Systems and Equipment volume of the ASHRAE Handbook, ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2004 Thus a heat pump may be thought of as a \\"heater\\" if the objective is to warm the heat sink (as when warming the inside of a home on a cold day), or a \\"refrigerator\\" or ‚Äúcooler‚Äù if the objective is to cool the heat source (as in the normal operation of a freezer). In either case, the operating principles are close. Heat is moved from a cold place to a warm place.  Thermodynamic cycles  According to the second law of thermodynamics heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter area; work is required to achieve this.Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics, by Howell and Buckius, McGraw-Hill, New York. An air conditioner requires work to cool a living space, moving heat from the cooler interior (the heat source) to the warmer outdoors (the heat sink). Similarly, a refrigerator moves heat from inside the cold icebox (the heat source) to the warmer room-temperature air of the kitchen (the heat sink). The operating principle of ideal heat engine was described mathematically using Carnot cycle by Sadi Carnot in 1824. An ideal refrigeration or a heat pump system can be thought of as an ideal heat engine that is operating in a reverse Carnot cycle. Heat pump and refrigeration cycles can be classified as vapor compression, vapor absorption, gas cycle, or Stirling cycle types. = Vapor-compression cycle = The vapor-compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators as well as in light commercial, commercial, and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. Figure 1: Vapor-compression refrigeration For comparison, a simple stylized diagram of a heat pump's vapor-compression refrigeration cycle: 1) condenser, 2) expansion valve, 3) evaporator, 4) compressor The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analysed on a diagramThe Ideal Vapor-Compression Cycle as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating working fluid commonly called refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a low pressure and low temperature vapor. The vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor superheated. The superheated vapor travels through the condenser which first cools and removes the superheat and then condenses the vapor into a liquid when releasing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. The liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of, typically,a small portion of the liquid.Temperature‚ÄìEntropy diagram of the vapor-compression cycle. That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet to complete the thermodynamic cycle. The above discussion is based on the ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, and does not take into account real-world effects like frictional pressure drop in the system, slight thermodynamic irreversibility during the compression of the refrigerant vapor, or non-ideal gas behavior (if any). = Vapor absorption cycle = In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used but, after the development of the vapor compression cycle, it lost much of its importance because of its low coefficient of performance (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Nowadays, the vapor absorption cycle is used only where heat is more readily available than electricity, such as industrial waste heat, solar thermal energy by solar collectors, or off-the-grid refrigeration in recreational vehicles. The absorption cycle is similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber and a generator. The absorber dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid (dilute solution) and therefore the dilute solution becomes a strong solution. Then, a liquid pump would move the strong solution from the absorber to a generator where, on heat addition, the temperature and pressure increase. Then the refrigerant vapor is released from the strong solution, which turns into the dilute solution and is moved back to the absorber by the liquid pump. Some work is required by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. However, the generator requires a heat source, which would consume heating energy unless waste heat is used. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) and water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) and lithium bromide (absorbent). Absorption refrigeration systems can be powered by fossil energies (i.e., coal, oil, natural gas, etc) or renewable energies (i.e., waste-heat recovery, biomass, solar energy). = Gas cycle = When the working fluid is a gas that is compressed and expanded but does not change phase, the refrigeration cycle is called a gas cycle. Air is most often this working fluid. As there is no condensation and evaporation intended in a gas cycle, components corresponding to the condenser and evaporator in a vapor compression cycle are the hot and cold gas-to-gas heat exchangers. For given extreme temperatures, a gas cycle may be less efficient than a vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle works on the reverse Brayton cycle instead of the reverse Rankine cycle. As such, the working fluid never receives or rejects heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect is equal to the product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, gas refrigeration cycle machines require a larger mass flow rate, which in turn increases their size. Because of their lower efficiency and larger bulk, air cycle coolers are not often applied in terrestrial refrigeration. The air cycle machine is very common, however, on gas turbine-powered jet airliners since compressed air is readily available from the engines' compressor sections. These jet aircraft's cooling and ventilation units also serve the purpose of heating and pressurizing the aircraft cabin. = Stirling engine = The Stirling cycle heat engine can be driven in reverse, using a mechanical energy input to drive heat transfer in a reversed direction (i.e. a heat pump, or refrigerator). There are several design configurations for such devices that can be built. Several such setups require rotary or sliding seals, which can introduce difficult tradeoffs between frictional losses and refrigerant leakage. =Reversed Carnot cycle= The Carnot cycle is a reversible cycle so the four processes that comprise it, two isothermal and two isentropic, can also be reversed. When a Carnot cycle runs reversely, it is called a reversed Carnot cycle. A refrigerator or heat pump that acts on the reversed Carnot cycle is called a Carnot refrigerator or Carnot heat pump respectively. In the first stage of this cycle, the refrigerant absorbs heat isothermally from a low-temperature source, TL, in the amount QL. Next, the refrigerant is isentropically compressed and its temperature rises to that of the high-temperature source, TH. Then at this high temperature, the refrigerant rejects heat isothermally in the amount QH. Also during this stage, the refrigerant changes from a saturated vapor to a saturated liquid in the condenser. Lastly, the refrigerant expands isentropically until its temperature falls to that of the low-temperature source, TL. Coefficient of performance The efficiency of a refrigerator or heat pump is given by a parameter called the coefficient of performance (COP). The equation is: :{\\\\rm COP} = \\\\frac{ Q}{ W} where * Q \\\\ is the useful heat supplied or removed by the considered system. * W \\\\ is the work required by the considered system. The Detailed COP of a refrigerator is given by the following equation: :COPR = (Desired Output)/(Required Input) = (Cooling Effect)/(Work Input) = QL/Wnet,in The COP of a heat pump (sometimes referred to as coefficient of amplification COA), given by the following equation, where QH = QL \\\\+ Wnet,in: :COPHP = (Desired Output)/(Required Input) = (Heating Effect)/(Work Input) = QH/Wnet,in = 1 + (QL/Wnet,in) Both the COP of a refrigerator and a heat pump can be greater than one. Combining these two equations results in: :COPHP = COPR \\\\+ 1 for fixed values of QH and QL This implies that COPHP will be greater than one because COPR will be a positive quantity. In a worst-case scenario, the heat pump will supply as much energy as it consumes, making it act as a resistance heater. However, in reality, as in home heating, some of QH is lost to the outside air through piping, insulation, etc., thus making the COPHP drop below unity when the outside air temperature is too low. Therefore, the system used to heat houses uses fuel. For Carnot refrigerators and heat pumps, COP can be expressed in terms of temperatures: :COPR,Carnot = TL/(TH-TL) = 1/((TH/TL) - 1) :COPHP,Carnot = TH/(TH-TL) = 1/(1 - (TL/TH)) References ;Notes  * External links * \\"The Basic Refrigeration Cycle\\" Category:Thermodynamic cycles Category:Heat pumps Category:Gas technologies ","title":"Heat pump and refrigeration cycle"},{"id":"11551241","text":"The Hawaii Express' Boeing 747 The Hawaii Express was a scheduled passenger airline that operated flights between Los Angeles, California (LAX) and Honolulu, Hawaii (HNL). It was nicknamed \\"The Big Pineapple\\" and started service with one Boeing 747-100 aircraft, featuring a unique and detailed paint job with a mango-colored tail and a rainbow-colored stripe down the side. History Founded by Michael Hartley, who would later go on to found Air Hawaii and CheapTickets, the airline began flights on August 20, 1982. The Vice-President of Operations was William Traver. Since the airline wanted to hire personnel with airline experience, the employment ad which ran in the airlines section of Los Angeles Times newspaper classified ads in the spring of 1982 listed previous 747 qualification as a requirement. The airline's original crew members included fifteen pilots, most of whom were from the recently bankrupted Braniff Airlines based in Dallas, Texas, while the original fifty flight attendants were furloughed from various major airlines in the United States. Four of those fifty flight attendants served as permanent pursers/First Flight Attendants. All crew members were based at Los Angeles International Airport with maintenance and gate facilities provided by TWA. Hawaii Express acquired two McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 aircraft in May 1983 to replace the 747, although all three aircraft were operated simultaneously for a while. The Hawaii Express suspended flights on December 20 of that year and filed for bankruptcy the following day.

He is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics, at Queen Mary University of London. Education After undergraduate study at the University of Cambridge, he completed his PhD at Stanford University under the supervision of Dana Scott in 1968. Career and research From 1973 to 1985, he was Professor of Mathematics at Yale University. From 1985 to 1999, he was Professor of Mathematical Logic at Merton College at the University of Oxford. In 1999, Macintyre moved to the University of Edinburgh, where he was Professor of Mathematics until 2002, when he moved to Queen Mary College, University of London. Macintyre was the first Scientific Director of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) in Edinburgh. Macintyre is known for many important results. These include classification of aleph-one categorical theories of groups and fields in 1971, which was very influential in the development of geometric stability theory. In 1976, he proved a result on quantifier elimination for p-adic fields from which a theory of semi-algebraic and subanalytic geometry for p-adic fields follows (in analogy with that for the real field) as shown by Jan Denef and Lou van den Dries and others. This quantifier elimination theorem was used by Jan Denef in 1984 to prove a conjecture of Jean-Pierre Serre on rationality of various p-adic Poincar√© series, and subsequently these methods have been applied to prove rationality of a wide range of generating functions in group theory (e.g. subgroup growth) and number theory by various authors, notably Dan Segal and Marcus du Sautoy. Macintyre worked with Zo√© Chatzidakis and Lou van den Dries on definable sets over finite fields generalising the estimates of Serge Lang and Andr√© Weil to definable sets an revisiting the work of James Ax on the logic of finite and pseudofinite fields. He initiated and proved results on the model theory of difference fields and of Frobenius automorphisms, where he proved extensions of Ax's work to this setting (including model-companions and decidability). Independently Ehud Hrushovski has proved model-theoretic results on Frobenius automorphisms. Macintyre developed a first-order model theory for intersection theory and showed connections to Alexander Grothendieck's standard conjectures on algebraic cycles. Macintyre has proved many results on the model theory of real and complex exponentiation. With Alex Wilkie he proved the decidability of real exponential fields (solving a problem of Alfred Tarski) modulo Schanuel's conjecture from transcendental number theory. With Lou van den Dries he initiated and studied the model theory of logarithmic-exponential series and Hardy fields. Together with David Marker and Lou van den Dries, he proved several results on the model theory of the real field equipped with restricted analytic functions, which has had many applications to exponentiation and O-minimality. The work of van den Dries-Macintyre-Marker has found many applications to (and is a very natural setting for problems in) Diophantine geometry on Shimura varieties (Anand Pillay, Sergei Starchenko, Jonathan Pila) and representation theory (Wilfried Schmid and Kari Vilonen). Macintyre has proved results on Boris Zilber's theory of the complex exponentiation, and Zilber's pseudo-exponential fields. Macintyre and Jamshid Derakhshan have developed a model theory for the adele ring of a number field where they prove results on quantifier elimination and measurability of definable sets. They use and extend foundational work by Solomon Feferman and Robert Vaught on the first-order theory of products of algebraic structures. The adele ring was introduced by Claude Chevalley. (The word \\"adele\\" is short for \\"additive idele\\"[2] and it was invented by Andr√© Weil. The previous name was the valuation vectors.) The initial purpose for introducing adeles was simplifying and clarifying class field theory. It quickly found applications in a wide range of problems in number theory after John Tate's thesis, the work of Andr√© Weil and Tsuneo Tamagawa on adelic groups and varieties, and work of Robert Langlands and others around the Langlands program. Macintyre and Marek Karpinski have proved several results on VC-dimension, which has had applications to theoretical computer science and neural networks.

Varieties There are varieties of b√°nh b√≤: *B√°nh b√≤ n∆∞·ªõng (literally \\"baked b√°nh b√≤\\") - This variety of b√°nh b√≤ is cooked by baking in a pan in an oven. It is generally off-white or yellowish-white in color on the inside and golden on the outside by caramelized coconut milk. Individual cakes are often large in size, in which case a serving will consist of a slice rather than the whole cake.photo This variety is definitely served alone. *B√°nh b√≤ h·∫•p (literally \\"steamed b√°nh b√≤\\") is similar in appearance to the baked version. These cakes are often small in size, ball-shaped and cooked from the liquid. B√°nh b√≤ h·∫•p may be white in color, green (by Pandanus amaryllifolius extract), pink or pale purple (by magenta plant extract). There are three ways to serve this variety. Like b√°nh b√≤ n∆∞·ªõng, it can be used alone. It can be put in the middle of b√°nh ti√™u (Chinese hollow doughnuts) and served. Also, people enjoy them in a small dish with coconut milk sauce including tapioca starch on top and a little bit mu·ªëi m√® or mu·ªëi ƒë·∫≠u ph·ªông (literally: sesame salt and peanut salt, respectively). ::Both traditional varieties are available in Vietnam as well as in Asian grocery stores in countries with substantial overseas Vietnamese populations, such as the United States and France. *B√°nh b√≤ s·ªØa (n∆∞·ªõng) (literally \\"(baked) milk b√°nh b√≤\\") is a brand new variety of b√°nh b√≤ appearing in the mid-2000s. Coconut milk, the official traditional ingredient is replaced by condensed milk or milk powder. The variety is cooked in a small pan. *B√°nh b√≤ d·ª´a (literally \\"coconut b√°nh b√≤\\") is the latest variety of b√°nh b√≤ appearing in the late 2000s. It is not generally recognized because it seems totally different from three above mainly from core ingredients. Core ingredients are wheat powder, hen eggs, baking soda, and obviously sweetened coconut. It tastes much leathery, seldom hard crispy and silky in the skin as opposed three above. In the middle, there is sweetened coconut with cooked mung bean. The Indian steamed rice cake called idli is similar in texture, although idli are never sweet.

Barbaro was born in Harrison, New York. His parents were immigrants from Barile, Italy, named Daniel \\"Donato\\" Barbaro and Carmella Teresa Paternoster Barbaro. He was one of seven sons. All of his six brothers enjoyed golfing. Barbaro became the golf team captain for Harrison High School beginning in his sophomore year For three years following with Barbaro as their captain, Harrison High School's golf team remained undefeated. On July 25, 1933, Barbaro (age 17) became the Westchester County Caddie Golf Champion, turning in 150-total for 36 holes at the Green Meadows Golf Club in Harrison, New York. Barbaro, at the age of 23 years, won the Providence Open (Providence, Rhode Island) on September 28, 1941, with a record 273, which was 15 under par and at least 6 shots or more ahead of Sammy Byrd, Sam Snead, Gene Sarazen, Toney Penna, Herman Barron, and Lawson Little. He gave the mere $1,200 Providence Open winnings to his younger brother, Tony to pay for medical school. Barbaro became a pro at the Green Meadows course in Harrison, New York at the age of 19. Only one year after becoming a member of the National Professional Golfers' Association, Barbaro beat the notoriously-tough Winged Foot Golf Club's (of Mamaroneck, New York) record scoring 69, 3 under par. He played the first eight holes in 35, four above the regulation. He had bogies on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th holes, and was all for quitting. But, comes a 9th and a birdie, the 10th and a birdie, the 11th and a birdie, the 12th and another birdie, the 13th and a par, the 14th and an eagle, the 15th and a birdie, and the 16th still another birdie. To recapitulate, his score at Winged Foot was eight under par for eight consecutive holes, the 9th through the 16th. The 14th hole eagle was something in itself; it was a par four, 383-yarder. He smashed his tee shot straight down the middle and then holed a niblick from more than 100 yards out. In the newspaper article documenting this, they quoted \\"Gee whiz, he must have a magnet, or something.\\" That day, Barbaro had four pars, seven birdies, one eagle, and six bogies; and the wind was blowing at a good clip (approximately 35 miles per hour) throughout the afternoon. Barbaro married Gretchen Gabler at the First Baptist Church Of White Plains in White Plains, New York on February 9, 1946. They had three children, Stephen, Louis Jr., and Christine. Although Barbaro was obviously talented at golfing, he put his family first and chose not to \\"hit-the-road\\" and tour too often, as he took his responsibilities as a husband and father more seriously than becoming \\"renowned\\" for his golfing. On May 20, 1949, Barbaro and teammate Bobby Jacobson were co-winners of the New Jersey State Pro-Am match-play championship held at Plainfield Country Club, after having twice been runners-up in the event.Sanderson-Lee Tie For Medal With 72\\", The New York Times, May 21, 1949. p. 16.

It should not be confused with the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, which exercises jurisdiction over federal law. The Supreme Court sits in the capital, Saipan, and consists of a Chief Justice and two Associate Justices. The CNMI has no intermediate appellate commonwealth law court, which means that the CNMI Supreme Court hears appeals directly from the trial-level Superior Court.

It uses components from vintage communications equipment as well as a mechanical filtering device to achieve a limited bandwidth frequency response similar to that of AM radio and the nostalgic sound of the early recordings. The Copperphone is manufactured by Pirro and distributed through his company Placid Audio. Placid Audio microphones have been used by many artists including Green Day, Queens of the Stone Age, Lou Barlow, Rush, Norah Jones, Jack White, St. Vincent, The Bright Light Social Hour, as well as Grammy Winning producer Jacquire King History Mark Pirro designed the first Copperphone while playing with The Polyphonic Spree. He wanted to produce a \\"telephone\\" voice effect for the group's lead singer Tim DeLaughter. Pirro created the Copperphone to produce the phone effect live on stage as opposed to relying on outboard effects. He created a few prototypes, including one using PVC and duct tape, which led to the creation of the first Copperphone. Pirro then started to produce small quantities of the Copperphone out of his garage. He later developed a smaller version of the Copperphone known as the Copperphone Mini. In 2003, Pirro founded the company Placid Audio for the manufacture and distribution of the Copperphone as well as other audio microphones. Placid Audio is based in Dallas, Texas. The Copperphone made national news in 2004 when it was mistaken for a pipe bomb as it passed through scanners at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Brian Teasley, percussion player of The Polyphonic Spree, was on his way home after a tour and had a Copperphone packed in his luggage. Due to the microphones suspicious appearance and internal wiring, Teasley's luggage was held back by TSA officials and the terminal was shut down. The bag was retrieved by the bomb squad using a robot and later 'disarmed' by blasting the contents of the bag with a water cannon. Teasley was unaware of the incident until he arrived at his residence in Birmingham, Alabama where he was approached and questioned by members of the FBI. Eventually the facts were confirmed that the device back in Dallas was not a pipe bomb but was indeed a microphone. The Copperphone survived the water blasting and continued to work as designed. Sound and features The Copperphone is hand made. It is built out of polished copper housings and manufactured with an adjustable aluminum mounting bracket to fit North American style microphone stands. The Copperphone naturally yields a classic telephone effect and can achieve a sound similar to an AM radio. The effect comes from the build of the microphone, with the housing working as a ported resonant chamber.

She had five sister ships; , Osterley, , Orvieto, and the Orama. These ships allowed the Orient Line a prized attraction to the traveling public: fixed sailings every other week to Australia and New Zealand. Requisitioned by the Royal Navy and deployed as an armed merchant cruiser, Otway was torpedoed and sunk by German U-boat off the Hebrides on 23 July 1917 during World War I, with the loss of 10 lives. Launch She was launched, on 21 November 1908, from the yards of the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Ltd., the christening ceremony being performed by Mrs. Frederick Green. The vessel was named after the well- known headland on the Victorian coast, Cape Otway. Description Immediately prior to her arrival at Sydney at the conclusion of her maiden voyage 21 August 1909, a reporter described the ship: \\"The Otway is equal in every respect to the Orsova, which has created a favourable impression since she first arrived here a fortnight ago. Her tonnage ‚Äî 12,077 ‚Äî is 41 tons in excess of that of the Orsova, so that she is the largest British mail steamer that has yet visited Australia. The principal dimensions of the Otway are:‚Äî Length, 552ft; breadth, 63ft 3in; depth, 46ft. She is subdivided into 10 watertight compartments, fitted for wireless telegraphy, and equipped with all the devices necessary to ensure efficient ventilation and sanitation. An important feature is a vast improvement in the accommodation for third-class passengers, a very important matter now that large numbers of English mechanics and labourers are finding out the great opportunities which Australia offers to them. These passengers are provided with a spacious dining saloon, music-room, and smoking-room, and their sleeping accommodation is mostly on the upper and main decks, and their promenade deck for exercise and amusement is unusually extensive. The first-class saloons, lounges, lodges and cabins are palatial and luxurious, and the second-saloon passengers find their accommodation in no way less roomy and comfortable, even though it is less highly embellished. A feature of the second-class is that the accommodation is entirely amidships.\\" An earlier report provided further details of her furnishings: \\"She is furnished in darker tints than Clydebank's Orsova. The first-class dining saloon is in walnut, in old English style. The lounge and drawing room are in Italian walnut, and the music-room adjoining in Italian walnut relief and planetree carving. The deck above has been raised so as to give a height below of about 11ft. The smoking room is in carved oak, old English style. Eight of the cabins are cabins deluxe and are finished in satinwood, oak, mahogany, and planetree. In the dining saloon and also in the bedrooms of the cabins deluxe there are ventilating punkahs, while in each cabin there is a ceiling fan. Many of the cabins are single berth, and a number are on the Bibby principle. The second class dining saloon is in polished mahogany, the ladies' or music room, in light oak, and the smoking room in teak. The third-class dining saloon, on the main deck, extends from side to side of the ship. The third class have also a ladles' room and smoking-room. The majority of the rooms are for two and four passengers.\\" Wireless telegraphy equipment At the time of launch, the Otway was stated to be being fitted for wireless telegraphy equipment. Her sister ship the RMS Otranto had actually been so fitted at time of commissioning and there was an expectation that the Otway would likewise. But when the Otway arrived in Melbourne 1 August 1909, it was reported: \\"Apparently the Orient S.N. Co. is in no hurry to equip all its liners with \\"wireless\\" until the establishment of Australian shore stations admits of practical use being made of the system between sea and land. In view, however, of the fact that the Otranto was installed with \\"wireless\\" before she left London on her present visit to the Commonwealth, it was generally anticipated that the other liners of the fleet would be similarly fitted in turn before their departure for Australia. This expectation, however, is not being fulfilled, as the Otway, which arrived at Port Melbourne yesterday morning, having left London a fortnight later than the Otranto, is still without a \\"wireless\\" apparatus. So far, therefore, the Otranto is the only vessel of the \\"Orient\\" line with this invaluable system installed. It will be remembered that the Otranto made free use of \\"wireless\\" on her voyage to Australia, establishing communication with shore stations and liners en route. The despatch and receipt of \\"wireless\\" messages by passenger steamers is naturally a great attraction to voyagers, whose interest in the \\"outside\\" world is thereby sustained from day to day whilst communication is possible with the shore. During the voyage of the Otranto, for instance, \\"wireless\\" exchanges passed between the liner and the Poldhu station, at Cornwall, England until at a distance of 1,500 miles further contact became impossible. As will be readily understood by those who have experienced the monotony of a sea voyage, items of news received from the land by \\"wireless\\" were greatly appreciated by the Otranto's passengers. The Otway berthed alongside the Port Melbourne Railway Pier early yesterday morning, having experienced a quiet and enjoyable trip from London via the usual stages. The passengers comprised about 90 in the saloon and 480 in the third class, all of whom were apparently well pleased with their sojourn on board the fine liner. She leaves for Sydney to-day.\\" Speed trials A report of 8 July 1909 was as follows: \\"The twin-screw steamer Otway, the second of the five liners built for the Orient Steam Navigation Co.'s mail service, ran full-power trials on the Firth of Clyde on 26 May. The Otway, ran the measured mile trials at Skelmorlie. She carried out a series of 12 runs, varying in speed from 13 knots to a maximum of 18.2 knots. Afterwards a series of trials were carried out to determine the diameter of the turning circle. This was found to be three cable lengths. Further trials consisted of four runs between the Cloch and Cumbrae Lights. These proved thoroughly successful, a mean speed of 17.87 knots being attained. Later she went on a six hours' continuous run at this speed. She afterwards left for London, running on the way a 24 hours' coal consumption trial. The stipulated limit is 1.4lb per i.h.p.\\" Maiden voyage The RMS Otway left London on her maiden voyage on 9 July 1909. Ports of call included Marseilles, Naples (18 July), Port Said (22 July), Suez (23 July), Colombo (2 August), Fremantle (12 August), Adelaide (16 August), Melbourne (18 August), Sydney (21 August), Brisbane (26 August), Sydney (30 August), Melbourne (6 September), Fremantle, Port Said, Naples, London. Upon arrival in Adelaide 16 August 1909, the local agent had arranged a special reception on the Otway for some 200 invited guests: \\"A special train which left Adelaide for the Outer Harbor on Monday afternoon carried a party of about 200 ladies and gentlemen who had been invited by the Orient Steam Navigation Company to a reception onboard the splendid new mail steamer Otway, which arrived from England on Monday morning. The guests were received by Mr M. G. Anderson, the Adelaide agent, and Captain F. Symons, R.N.R., the commander, and were shown over the vessel, the luxurious appointments of which were generally admired. The cost of the great ocean liner approximated to ¬£350,000, and she has a register of 12,077 tons, with a capacity for carrying many hundreds of passengers in the three classes. The chief dining saloon is superb, and so are the smoking, reading, and drawing rooms set apart for first-class travellers. Even the apartments reserved for second class passengers are fitted in a much more, costly fashion than are the best hotels in this city, while the third- class dining saloon is a spacious chamber the full width of the ship, and well lighted from both sides. The acme of comfort has been reached in the staterooms, which are as large and as airy as many bedrooms ashore, while the suites consisting of staterooms, bathroom, sitting-room, and maids' room were so attractive that they instilled a desire for ocean travel into many hearts. The sleeping apartments in the second class are desirable chambers, both in regard to their size and their appointments, and generally, the company in the Otway appear to have reached as nearly to perfection in the endeavour to cater for the comfort of their patrons asleep and awake as it is possible to reach even in these days of great achievements. There are several promenade decks, which run practically the whole length of the ship, and the space thus available for exercise is remarkable. It is \\"a Sabbath day's journey\\" to get from one end of the Otway to the other, while the decks are all so high above the water that a most comprehensive view of the surroundings is obtainable from them. The company hospitably entertained the visitors at afternoon tea, and a fine programme of instrumental music, including selections from a number of favorite operas, was rendered by the Otway band. The special tram left the Outer Harbor at 5 p.m. amid cheers from the steamer's passengers, and not long afterwards the mail boat resumed her voyage to Melbourne. Everyone present thoroughly enjoyed the trip, which was made particularly pleasurable by the excellent arrangements of Mr Anderson for the convenience of his guests.\\" Details of the crew were provided in a report of her arrival in Melbourne (18 August 1909): \\"With names obliterated it would be impossible to distinguish the R.M.S. Orsova from her consort Otway, which arrived yesterday. The Otway berthed alongside the Railway Pier at Port Melbourne, where for the rest of the day she was an object of interest and admiration. Her arrival could not have been made under more propitious conditions, the weather leaving nothing to be desired. ln every sense the voyage of the new liner was a distinct success. Leaving London on 9 July, the Otway met with fine weather, which continued to prevail throughout the voyage. There were 500 passengers. The Otway made the customary port calls on her way to Melbourne. She is under the care of Captain F. S. Symons, who has associated with him the following officers:‚Äî Chief, Mr W. de V. Baynham; second, Mr C. Mathieson; third, Mr C. F. Halliday; surgeon, Mr L. Stephen; purser, Mr Windle; chief engineer, Mr D. Williamson; second engineer, Mr G.D.S. White; chief steward, Mr T. E. Rimington. The Otway will leave here for Sydney at noon today.\\" Career =Mail Steamer= The Otway left London on her second voyage on 29 October 1909. =Armed merchant cruiser= Fate A brief report 27 July 1917 advised the loss of the Otway: \\"R.M.S. OTWAY TORPEDOED AND SUNK; LONDON, Thursday.‚Äî The Admiralty announces that the armed merchant cruiser Otway (Orient line) was torpedoed and sunk on July 22 in northern waters. Ten men were killed, the remainder being saved. [Before the war the Otway was a regular trader to Australia, calling at Hobart for apples.]\\" Otway was torpedoed and sunk by German U-boat off the Hebrides on 23 July 1917 during World War I, with the loss of 10 lives.

It is located between Lac Ste. Anne County and the County of Barrhead No. 11, 85 km north-west from Edmonton, east of the Grizzly Trail. The lake is located within the Athabasca River basin and is fed by Majeau Creek, with water levels controlled by a dam, on the outflowing MacDonald Creek which then flows into the Pembina River.  History  Lac la Nonne is fairly large (11.8 km2) and deep (maximum depth 19.8 m) lake located about 90 km northwest of Edmonton in the counties of Barrhead and Lac Ste. Anne. This is a highly developed and popular recreational lake. The closest large population centre is the town of Barrhead, 20 km to the north. The name of the lake was originally mi-ka-sioo, meaning \\"eagle\\" in Cree. Lac La Nonne State of the Watershed Report, October, 2006, PG.12 The current name, Lac la Nonne has an uncertain origin but is believed to derive from \\"the nun\\" in French. In 1827, Edward Ermatinger recorded the lake's name in his journal as Lac La Nane or ‚ÄúLac La Nan‚Äú. It has been suggested that the name comes from the white-winged scoter, a duck with features similar to ducks in England known as \\"the nun\\". The Hudson's Bay Company established a trading post at the lake in the early 19th century; by the 1830s there were many M√©tis, and by the 1870s a Catholic mission had been established. In the 1890s several families had settled around the lake, and by 1912 most of the available land had been homesteaded. The Atlas of Alberta Lakes has this to say about the history of Lac LaNonne:  On the York Factory Express  Lac la Nonne was on the York Factory Express the main overland connection between HBC headquarters at York Factory and the principal station of Columbia Department, Fort Vancouver, as recorded in the York Factory Express Journals of ‚Äú1827-182S‚Äù by Edward Ermatinger's York Factory Express Journal.  Among the earliest land grants in Alberta granted at Lac la Nonne  Only three years after the Hudson's Bay Company assumed responsibility for Ruperts Land it started surveying for issuing special land grants at Lac la Nonne:  Connection to the Klondike Trail   Camp Encounter  Currently owned by Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton, Camp Encounter has this to say about its history at Lac La Nonne: Killdeer Beach Resort and Elksbeach Campground are the two commercial facilities at the lake. No commercial fisheries exist on the lake, although sport fishery, with the main catches being walleye and northern pike, is very popular in the summer. Killdeer Beach was established in 1928, making it one of Alberta's oldest such resorts. \\"In 1928 a local recreation centre was founded called Killdeer Beach Resort on the southwest shore.\\" LacSte Anne County Trails The following quote is taken from GeoTourism Canada's more extensive history and descriptive page on Lac La None: Land acquisition around this lake and cottage development on the shoreline increased through to the 1970s until most of the shoreline became privately owned. Many cottages have been winterized and general lake use has intensified over the last half of the 20th century. Due to concerns about the quality of the lake, further development around the lake was halted through regulations enforced by Alberta Environment.\\"University of Alberta.

Significant portions of the highway are concurrent with other highways, most significantly, U.S. Highway 34 between Culbertson and Hastings. Also, from Milford east to the Iowa border, the highway is closely paralleled by Interstate 80. Large portions of the route parallel the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Route description US 6 runs east as Dodge Street in Omaha U.S. Highway 6 enters Nebraska from Colorado west of Imperial on a short southeasterly segment. It turns east and stays due east until shortly before Imperial. It then goes into Imperial and meets Nebraska Highway 61. The two routes are paired together until they separate at the Enders Reservoir State Recreation Area. It goes in a generally southeasterly direction until it meets U.S. Highway 34 west of Culbertson. US 6 and US 34 continue east together through Culbertson and at McCook, is briefly concurrent with U.S. Highway 83. US 6/34 continue together in a northeasterly direction through Cambridge, then turns due east and meets U.S. Highway 283 in Arapahoe. Near Edison, it meets U.S. Highway 136, which begins at its intersection with US 6/34. Further east, the two highways meet Nebraska Highway 4 and turns northeast towards Holdrege, Nebraska. In Holdrege, US 6/34 meet U.S. Highway 183. The highways continue on a northeasterly trajectory through Minden until Heartwell. At Heartwell, US 6/34 turns due east until Hastings. In Hastings, US 6/34 meet U.S. Highway 281 and US 34 separates to go with US 281 while US 6 continues eastward. US 6 continues on a due east highway from Hastings. Near Sutton, the highway turns northeast to go through Sutton. It continues east and at Fairmont, US 6 encounters U.S. Highway 81. After passing through Friend, US 6 meets Nebraska Highway 15 and the two highways overlap until shortly before Milford. US 6 goes east, then north out of Milford, then US 6 turns east to go towards Lincoln. In Lincoln, US 6 comes into the city on West \\"O\\" Street, portions of which are divided highway. At Sun Valley Boulevard, it turns to go northeasterly. At North 10th Street, US 6 turns north-northwest and becomes North 11th Street, a divided highway. At Cornhusker Highway, US 6 turns east with a short urban connection to Interstate 180 on the west along Cornhusker. US 6 then follows Cornhusker Highway, which is a divided highway, northeast out of the city. At the eastern end of Cornhusker Highway (near Waverly), US 6 meets Interstate 80. From Interstate 80, US 6 goes northeast through Waverly, Greenwood and Ashland. East of Ashland, US 6 crosses the Platte River. After that, US 6 meets Nebraska Highway 31 in Gretna, where US 6 turns north with NE 31 on a divided highway. US 6/NE 31 meet U.S. Highway 275 and Nebraska Highway 92 near the Elkhorn neighborhood of Omaha and they separate in Elkhorn itself at a freeway interchange which also has Nebraska Link 28B, a connector to US 275. At this point, US 6 goes onto the freeway, the West Dodge Expressway, and turns due east to go towards downtown Omaha. At 137th Street is the exit for Boys Town. Between 120th and 108th Streets, US 6 is an elevated freeway with separate viaducts for eastbound and westbound traffic. Shortly after this ends, US 6 meets Interstate 680. East of I-680, US 6 continues east as West Dodge Road and at Cass Street, turns briefly southeast where West Dodge Road ends and US 6 follows Dodge Street eastward. Before 30th Street, US 6 splits into two one-way streets, with Dodge Street serving westbound traffic, and Douglas Street serving the eastbound. US 6 goes through downtown and then goes up onto Interstate 480, which is an elevated freeway around downtown Omaha, and shortly thereafter, crosses into Iowa via the Grenville Dodge Memorial Bridge. History right When the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926, much of the current US 6 in Nebraska was U.S. Highway 38. The route was slightly different in the Omaha area, as it turned east from 204th Street onto Q Street to go through what was the city of Millard. It went through Millard on what is now Millard Avenue (Nebraska Highway 50), then north on 132nd Street, then east on Center Street, and then north on 36th Street to end at Farnam Street. In 1932, US 38 was deleted and replaced by US 6. The cities of Hastings and Lincoln also had City U.S. Highway 6. These are former routes for US 6 in those cities. City US 6 in Hastings was deleted in 1970 and in Lincoln, it was deleted in 1983.  Future  The Nebraska Department of Roads is planning a total rebuild and partial realignment/rerouting of U.S. 6 from its current path along Sun Valley Boulevard in Lincoln, Nebraska.

History  During the Last Glacial Maximum in the Late Pleistocene, the climate in the region of Suba gave rise to alternations of p√°ramo and Andean forests. Since approximately 12,000 years BP, groups of hunter-gatherers inhabited the area. Around 3500 BC, the people began to domesticate animals, cultivate crops and create arts and crafts. By 500 BC, maize and potatoes were the predominant products cultivated and by the year 800 the Muisca inhabited the area. After the Spanish conquest of the Muisca, in 1538, the Muisca were preserved in a Resguardo, located in the area of Suba and to the north in Ch√≠a and Cota. In 1550, Antonio D√≠as Cardoso and Hern√°n Camilo Monsilva founded the village of Suba. On June 22, 1850, the Resguardo of the Muisca in Suba was closed and the indigenous people forced away from the urban areas. This process continued until the year 1877. On November 16, 1875, Suba was declared a territory free of indigenous people and became a satellite municipality of Bogot√°. It became a municipality by decree during the Sovereign State of Cundinamarca. The rural area then was divided into landlords and peasants. In 1954 the municipality was formally annexed to the \\"Special District of Bogot√°\\" during the reign of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla while still keeping its municipality status. In 1977, a minor city hall was constructed and in 1991 Suba was elevated to a locality of the renamed Capital District. In 1990, the indigenous peoples of Suba and their towns were legally recognized by the government and ratified in the Colombian Constitution of 1991. In 1992 and 2001, the Cabildo Muisca of Suba and the Cabildo Muisca of Bosa respectively were legally recognized in an official ceremony with the participation of the then Mayor of Bogot√° Antanas Mockus as stipulated in the Law 89 of 1890 and after more than a century without legal existence, it was also ratified in 2005. ratificado  Indigenous population  According to the numbers provided by the respective Cabildos, the Muisca population of Suba is estimated to 5186 people. The indigenous last names with their origin in Suba are conserved as Niviayo, Bulla, Cabiativa, Caita, Nivia, Chisaba, Muzuzu, Neuque, Yopas√°, and Quinche.

He worked in Cameroon's state administration during the 1960s and then worked at the African Development Bank through the 1970s. After a stint as head of Cameroon Airlines in the mid-1980s, he participated in the beginnings of multiparty politics in the early 1990s, becoming Secretary- General of the UPC. Allying himself with President Paul Biya, he was appointed to the government as Minister of State for Planning and Regional Development from 1992 to 1994 and then as Minister of State for Agriculture from 1994 to 1997. Subsequently, he was again Minister of State for Agriculture from 2002 to 2004 and Minister of State for Planning from 2004 to 2007. Background and administrative career Kodock was born at Mom village in the Makak District of Nyong-et-Kell√© Department, located in the Centre Province of Cameroon, in 1933. Following independence in 1960, he became Deputy Director of Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Finance in 1961; he was then posted in Douala for about six months as Director of External Economic Relations and subsequently was Director of Economic Orientation. He also coordinated the preparation of Cameroon's first five-year plan, and from 1963 to 1965 he served in the government as Secretary of State for Finance; he was then appointed as Director of Litigation and Studies at the Ministry of Territorial Administration in 1965. Later, he worked at the African Development Bank from 1968 to 1980 and was appointed as Technical Adviser to Cameroon's Ministry of Finance in 1982. He was President Director-General of Cameroon Airlines (CAMAIR) from May 1984 to September 1985,Andreas Mehler, Kamerun in der √Ñra Biya (1993), page 269 . and he participated in the founding congress of the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (RDPC), held in Bamenda in 1985, as a member of its Transport Commission.Jean-Pierre Biyiti Essam, \\"Etre ou ne pas √™tre du RDPC\\", Cameroon Tribune, January 16, 2009 . Political career during the 1990s In 1991, Kodock was elected as Secretary-General of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) at its Nkongsamba congress, and in the March 1992 parliamentary election he was elected to the National Assembly as a UPC candidate in Nyong-et-Kelle constituency. In the National Assembly, he became President of the UPC Parliamentary Group. President Paul Biya, who was facing strong opposition in 1992, sought to improve his position by dividing and weakening the opposition. Two weeks before the 11 October 1992 presidential election, the UPC Parliamentary Group signed an agreement to support Biya on 28 September 1992. Kodock's decision to support Biya was an important development, as it gave Biya a political boost at a crucial moment and buttressed his precarious parliamentary majority. By drawing Kodock over to his side, Biya may have also hoped to fuel factionalism within the UPC and thereby weaken the party as a political force. Ultimately, Biya narrowly won the presidential election with a plurality of the vote, according to the controversial official results;Joseph Takougang, \\"Cameroon: Biya and Incremental Reform\\", in Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), eds. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, pages 171-172. subsequently he appointed Kodock to the government as Minister of State for Planning and Regional Development on 27 November 1992. As Secretary-General of the UPC, Kodock was a firm supporter of the unitary state, which was created by President Ahmadou Ahidjo in 1972; he believed that national unity, facilitated by a strong central government, was crucial to the development of Cameroon. He denounced the notion of federalism, which was favored by some Anglophone Cameroonians; in 1993, he said that \\"linguistic fractioning brought about by colonisation cannot determine the future course of our country. The return of Anglophone Cameroon and the unification are the greatest achievements of Cameroon since independence.\\"The Herald, June 9-16, 1993, page 6, cited in Piet Konings and Francis B. Nyamnjoh, Negotiating an Anglophone Identity: A Study of the Politics of Recognition and Representation in Cameroon (2003), page 159. At around the same time, he filed a defamation suit against staff at two newspapers, La Nouvelle Expression and Galaxie, for reporting that an official at his ministry was embezzling money.George B. N. Ayittey, Africa in Chaos (1999), page 233. Continuing to serve in the government, he was moved to the position of Minister of State for Agriculture on July 21, 1994. The UPC was divided by internal disagreements during the 1990s. Kodock's moderate faction, which was allied to the RDPC, emerged from the intraparty struggles as the dominant faction, although it was opposed by the party's more radical members.Milton H. Krieger and Joseph Takougang, African State and Society in the 1990s: Cameroon's Political Crossroads (2000), Westview Press, page 160. In 1996, the UPC split into different factions, one of which was led by Kodock and another by Ndeh Ntumazah.Donald F. Busky, Communism in History and Theory (2002), page 115. Kodock's faction held a congress at Makak in 1996, at which he was re-elected as Secretary-General. He was also re-elected to the National Assembly from Nyong-et-Kelle constituency in the 1997 parliamentary election1997 election results. and was the only UPC candidate to win a seat. After the election, he was excluded from the government that was formed on December 7, 1997, in which a rival UPC leader, Henri Hogb√© Nlend, was named Minister of Scientific Research.Edmond Kamguia, \\"Coalition: Antar Gassagay quitte le navire\\", La Nouvelle Expression, December 11, 2004 . Return to the government On January 13, 2001, Kodock and various other party leaders participated in an unauthorized protest in Yaound√© against the National Election Observatory, believing that it would not be an impartial body. The protest was dispersed by security forces, and Kodock, along with the other party leaders, was detained for five hours.\\"U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2001 - Cameroon\\", United States Department of State, March 4, 2002. According to Kodock, the Observatory's neutrality was doubtful because its members were all appointed by President Biya.\\"Les membres de l'ONEL pr√™tent serment devant la cour supr√™me\\", Panapress, 26 October 2001 . In the June 2002 parliamentary election, Kodock was again re-elected to the National Assembly from Nyong-et-Kelle constituency;2002 election results. the UPC list of three candidates in Nyong-et-Kelle received a narrow majority over the RDPC, with 50.80% of the vote. Following the election, Kodock briefly presided over the National Assembly prior to the election of its bureau due to his status as the oldest member of the National Assembly at age 69.\\"Augustin Fr√©d√©ric Kodock, Pr√©sident provisoire de l'Assembl√©e nationale\\" , Cameroon- info.net, August 1, 2007 . He was then appointed as Minister of State for Agriculture in the government named on August 24, 2002, thus returning to the government after five years of absence from it. He and the UPC-K supported Biya in the October 2004 presidential election, citing Biya's accomplishments as President.Emmanuel Kendemeh, \\"Election 2004: CPDM Patiently Awaits Results\\", Cameroon Tribune, October 18, 2004. After that election, he was moved to the position of Minister of State for Planning in the government named on December 8, 2004. Speaking at a conference in Limbe on 1 September 2006, Kodock discussed the lack of economic development in Cameroon. He described a visit to South Korea; according to Kodock, South Korea and Cameroon had similar GDPs in the 1960s, but South Korea had since then made vast strides, developing a prosperous and modern economy, while Cameroon, still deeply impoverished, was no longer even remotely comparable. He stressed the importance of unity and cooperation among Cameroonians and the need for \\"a new spirit to build this country\\". Recalling that the UPC had been founded with three goalsindependence, national unity, and the achievement of a high standard of livingKodock noted that the last of those goals was still distant, while emphasizing the importance of national unity in achieving it. He also bemoaned Cameroon's reliance on imports and its failure to take advantage of its own resources, and he said that Cameroon needed to find the will to develop its economy.Francis Tim Mbom, \\"Cameroon Lacks The Will To Develop - Kodock\\", The Post, 4 September 2006. At a workshop held to assess progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals on December 5-7, 2006, Kodock said that he saw no real hope that Cameroon could meet the goals by 2015.\\"Le gouvernement camerounais inquiet par rapport √† l'atteinte des OMD\\", African Press Agency, December 7, 2006 . He was re-elected as Secretary- General of the UPC-Kodock faction at a congress on December 30-31, 2006; he also gained stronger powers at the congress.Roland Tsapi, \\"partis politiques: Ils s'√©ternisent au pouvoir\\" , Le Messager, January 26, 2007 . Political activities after 2006 Kodock ran again as a UPC candidate for re-election to the National Assembly in the July 2007 parliamentary election,\\"More than 1200 candidates vie for 180 MP seats in Cameroon\\", African Press Agency, June 1, 2007.\\"Deux ministres camerounais candidats aux l√©gislatives\\", African Press Agency, July 15, 2007 . saying that he believed it was important that a minister in the government obtain popular legitimacy through election to a parliamentary seat. However, Kodock was defeated according to initial results. He filed a request for the election in his district, Nyong-et-Kelle (which he described as his party's \\"natural stronghold\\"), to be cancelled, alleging fraud on the part of RDPC candidates.Aim√©-Francis Amougou, \\"Cameroun: Aujourd'hui, dernier d√©lai de recours\\", Cameroon Tribune, July 26, 2007 . In August, the Supreme Court accordingly cancelled the election in Nyong-et- Kelle, giving Kodock another opportunity to win the seat when the election was held again.\\"Cameroun: Augustin Fr√©d√©ric Kodock - Il sacoche au serpent\\", Le Quotidien Mutations, August 10, 2007 . Kodock remained Minister of State for Planning until he was dismissed from the government in a cabinet reshuffle on September 7, 2007.\\"Remaniement: La Vid√©o\\" , cameroon-info.net, September 7, 2007 . Kodock then denounced Biya for allegedly killing democracy.\\"Country of Origin Information Report: Cameroon\\", British Border & Immigration Agency, January 16, 2008. It was believed that Kodock was excluded from the government because his support had fallen to such a level that it was no longer politically useful to include him; his age may have also been a factor (he was then 74 years old).Kini Nsom and Nformi Sonde Kinsai, \\"Cameroon: Despite Cabinet Reshuffle Northerners Still Gun for Inoni's Job\\", The Post, September 13, 2007. In the re-vote held in Nyong-et-Kelle on September 30, the UPC list headed by Kodock was defeated by the RDPC list, receiving about 40% of the vote against 55% for the RDPC, according to provisional results.Aim√©-Francis Amougou, \\"Elections partielles: Le Rdpc confirme sa supr√©matie\\", Cameroon Tribune, October 2, 2007 . UPC factionalism was considered a factor contributing to the defeat, with Kodock's rival Henri Hogb√© Nlend calling for people to vote for the RDPC; additionally, some in the UPC reportedly declined to vote for Kodock because they felt it was time for new leadership in the party.Jean Francis Belibi, \\"Nyong et Kell√© : Le glas a sonn√© pour Kodock\\", Mutations, October 2, 2007 . Kodock appealed to the Supreme Court for the RDPC list to be disqualified and for the revote to be annulled, but the Supreme Court rejected his request on October 10.Armand Essogo, \\"Contentieux post- √©lectoral des l√©gislatives partielles : sans surprise\\" , Cameroon Tribune, October 11, 2007 . Kodock criticized the National Elections Observatory's generally positive report on the 2007 election, which was published on July 31, 2008; according to Kodock, the election in Nyong-et-Kelle had been blatantly rigged through vote-buying, intimidation, and violence.Kini Nsom, \\"Opposition Says NEO Report is Fallacious\\", The Post, 4 August 2008. Although summoned to appear before State Counsel at the Mfoudi High Court on June 17, 2008, as part of an investigation regarding embezzlement of public funds, Kodock refused to appear, denouncing the investigation as a smear campaign against him.Kini Nsom, \\"Kodock Woos State Anger\\", The Post, June 20, 2008. At a press conference on January 30, 2009, Kodock said that 2008 had been a disappointing year for the economy, which he attributed to poor governance. He criticized the country's leaders for allegedly enriching themselves at the expense of the general population and failing to make productive use of money made available through debt cancellation. He also accused the government of assisting Hogb√© Nlend's UPC faction as a means of weakening the party. However, he refrained from denouncing the composition of the newly appointed Elections Cameroon (ELECAM) electoral commission, unlike some opposition leaders, saying that ELECAM should be given a chance and judged on its performance.Daniel Gwarbarah, \\"Late Marthe Moumie Was No Longer a UPC Militant - Kodock\\", The Post, February 6, 2009. On April 10, 2009, at a celebration marking the 61st anniversary of the UPC's founding, Kodock called for party unity; he described the UPC as \\"the immortal soul of the Cameroonian people\\" and warned that those dividing it were \\"cursed\\".Pierre-Marie Djongo, \\"Kodock promet la mal√©diction aux d√©tracteurs de l'Upc\\", Le Messager, April 13, 2009 . On the same occasion, he stressed the need for political dialogue and said that patriots should mobilize and work for the improvement of living standards in Cameroon. He also said that \\"the only way of honoring the sacrifices of the founding fathers of the UPC is to make Cameroon a model in the Central African Sub-region\\".Emmanuel Kendemeh, \\"UPC Advocates Political Dialogue in Cameroon\\", Cameroon Tribune, April 14, 2009. Following the death of veteran UPC leader Ndeh Ntumazah in early 2010, Ntumazah's family refused to allow Kodock to speak at his funeral. Although Kodock and Ntumazah had once been rivals within the UPC, Kodock described Ntumazah as \\"a long-time friend\\" and \\"a comrade of the struggle\\", and he said that he was insulted by the family's decision to exclude him. Ntumazah's family, on the other hand, argued that the decision was appropriate because Kodock had ignored Ntumazah during the years of illness that preceded his death; they claimed that Kodock had never phoned to inquire about Ntumazah's health.Rodrigue N. Tongue, \\"Les enfants Ntumazah accusent Kodock de blasph√®me\\" , Le Messager, 5 April 2010 . At Nyong-et-Kelle on 30 April 2011, amidst continued UPC factionalism, Kodock was designated as his faction's candidate for the October 2011 presidential election. A few months later, he was taken to South Africa to be treated for illness.Georges Alain Boyomo, \\"Pr√©sidentielle 2011: Les ca√Ømans ne tombent pas les masques\\", Mutations, 19 July 2011 . Kodock was ultimately unable to stand as a presidential candidate because the authorities rejected his application.Clarisse Juompan, \\"Cameroun : les grands absents de la pr√©sidentielle\\", Jeune Afrique, 3 October 2011 . Shortly after the rejection of his presidential candidacy, Kodock, who was still Secretary-General of the UPC, died on 24 October 2011 at the age of 78. He was buried at Mom village, his birthplace, on 17 December 2011.Jean De Dieu Bidias, \\"Obs√®ques : Augustin Fr√©deric Kodock quitte d√©finitivement l'Upc\\", Mutations, 19 December 2011 .

Fowler (born February 18, 1970) is an American social scientist specializing in social networks, cooperation, political participation, and genopolitics (the study of the genetic basis of political behavior). He is currently Professor of Medical Genetics in the School of Medicine and Professor of Political Science in the Division of Social Science at the University of California, San Diego. He was named a 2010 Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation.http://www.gf.org/fellows/16759-james-fowler Background Fowler earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard College in 1992, a master's degree in International Relations from Yale University in 1997, and a Ph.D. in Government from the Harvard University in 2003. He was also a Peace Corps volunteer in Ecuador from 1992 to 1994. In 2010, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers.\\"Foreign Policy Magazine\\" Research Fowler's research centers on social networks. He is best known for his studies of the social spread of obesity, smoking, and happiness in the Framingham Heart Study, but he has also studied the network of legislative cosponsorships in the U.S. Congress and the network of U.S. Supreme Court precedents. Studies by Nicholas A. Christakis and Fowler suggested a variety of individuals' attributes like obesity, smoking cessation, and happiness rather than being individualistic, are causally correlated by contagion mechanisms that transmit these behaviors over long distances within social networks. A debate over the statistical models used to establish these three degrees of influence findings ensued, but subsequent studies have found evidence of their central claims about behavioral influence and contagion. In addition to his research on social networks, Fowler has become known for his work on genopolitics, showing that genes influence voting and other forms of political participation. Fowler used twin studies of voter turnout in Los Angeles and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to establish that the decision to vote in the United States has very strong heritability. He has also identified three genes that are associated with voter turnout and partisan attachment, specifically those regulating the serotonin and dopamine systems in the brain via the production of monoamine oxidase, 5HTT, and DRD2. More recently, he has shown evidence that social networks have a partly genetic basis. In 2010, he published a paper regarding the use of social networks as 'sensors' for forecasting epidemics. In other research, Fowler is known for his theoretical and experimental work on egalitarianism and the evolution of cooperation, with related work on altruism, overconfidence, and political participation. Fowler's newest research focuses on Facebook friendship as a predictor of voter mobilization, and the use of the social network medium, to mobilize voters in American elections. Based on a large manipulation of friendship cues in the Facebook social network, Fowler demonstrates that being presented with indications of friends having voted is a strong predictor of individual voting. Books In September 2009, Little, Brown & Co. published Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives by Nicholas A. Christakis and James H. Fowler. Connected draws on previously published and unpublished studies, including the Framingham Heart Study and makes several new conclusions about the influence of social networks on human health and behavior.http://www.connectedthebook.com/ \\"Connected The Book\\" Official Website In Connected, they put forward their \\"three degrees of influence\\" rule about human behavior, which theorizes that each person's individual social influence stretches three degrees before it fades out. The Colbert Report On February 28, 2008, the Los Angeles Times published an op-ed that summarized Fowler's research showing that Democratic candidates who come on The Colbert Report receive 44% more in campaign donations in the first 30 days after appearing on the show. Colbert pointed out the op-ed on his March 3, 2008 show. Fowler also appeared during the Threatdown on his December 10, 2008 show, describing his work on the spread of happiness in social networks, and again on the January 7th, 2010 show to discuss the sociological impact of social networking.

The newspaper's coverage area includes parts of Guilford, Davidson, Randolph and Forsyth counties in the Piedmont Triad area of North Carolina. The Enterprise is owned by Paxton Media Group. The paper was founded in 1885 and is a member of the North Carolina Press Assocaiation. History The Enterprise was founded as a weekly newspaper in November 1885. In 1888 Charles Farriss purchased the paper. Soon after, he left the paper in the hands of his brother J.J. Farriss, a former editor of The Biblical Recorder, the newspaper of the North Carolina Baptist Convention. On September 9, 1904 the paper became a daily. In 1919, the paper was bought by J.P Rawley (1886-1937) and R.B. Terry (1883-1955), and it remained in the Rawley and Terry families for eight decades. The newspaper moved to 210 Church Ave. in 1970. It moved in August 2014 from that location to its current home at 213 Woodbine St., a facility that allows space for a new printing press. =Recent history= On October 3, 1994, the paper shifted from afternoon publication to mornings. In 1999, the Rawley family sold its stake of the newspaper company, which also included The Thomasville Times, The Archdale-Trinity News and the Triad Business News, to Paxton Media. Longtime publisher Randall B. Terry Jr. held onto his half of the company. The relationship between Terry and Paxton was testy. In 2000, Terry accused Paxton of trying to cut local content. Paxton sued Terry, alleging mismanagement. In June 2001, the paper cut 16.5 positions, including eight full-time jobs and two part-time jobs from the main newspaper. Terry died of cancer in May 2004. Soon after, Paxton bought the remaining shares of the newspaper. Rick Bean became publisher in May 2004. Upon assumption of operations, Paxton fired Gary B. Moore, general manager, and laid off 20 employees after it closed ESP, a weekly entertainment newspaper. The paper underwent a redesign in 2005. More layoffs took place at the Enterprise in 2007. In early 2008, Bean became publisher of the Herald-Sun in Durham, and, in May 2008, Mike Starn became publisher of the Enterprise. On Feb. 9, 2009, Paxton Media Group officials informed High Point Enterprise employees that printing and related business would be handled by the Durham Herald-Sun in Durham, N.C., effective March 2. Effective February 2011, Jodi Brookshire became publisher of the Enterprise. In October 2012, Rick Bean returned to serve as both publisher of the Enterprise and Herald-Sun. In August 2014, the Enterprise resumed printing operations at its facilities. At its new location, 213 Woodbine St., the Enterprise also prints the Herald-Sun in Durham, as well as other Paxton papers from Sanford, Henderson and Monroe. In August 2015 the High Point Enterprise Launched a new website allowing the integration of Facebook commenting and better ad locations. In April 2016 The Enterprise started HPE: High Point Talks a podcast under information Technology manager Allison Temple and Editor Megan Ward. The channel featuring their staff in interviews, story and discussionary type shows and hopes to move the paper further into newer technology.

It is in the church of Ognissanti in Florence. Botticelli was born in a house in the same street as the church, still called Via Borgo Ognissanti. He was to live within a minute or two's walk of this all his life, and to be buried in the church.Lightbown, 17‚Äì19 History In 1464 Botticelli's father bought a house in Via Nuova nearby (modern Via della Porcellana), which Sandro took over in 1470 and lived in for the rest of his life. Here the notable family on the street were the Vespucci, including Amerigo Vespucci, born in 1454, after whom the Americas were named. The Vespucci were close Medici allies, and would become regular patrons of Botticelli.Lightbown, 18‚Äì19 The work was commissioned by the Vespucci family, probably Amerigo's father Nastaglio, a notary, and his brother Giorgio Antonio, both neighbours of Botticelli.Lightbown, 77 Someone else, probably the order running the church,Lightbown, 77 commissioned Domenico Ghirlandaio to do a facing Saint Jerome; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects. As in other cases, such direct competition \\"was always an inducement to Botticelli to put out all his powers\\", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Ronald Lightbown.Lightbown, 73‚Äì78, 74 quoted Both depicted two Doctors of the Church in their studies, with a number of objects which mark them as scholars and precursors of Renaissance Humanism. There is known to have been a small painting of Jerome in his study said to have been by Jan van Eyck in the Medici collection, which is now lost. This may have influenced both frescos.Legouix, 76 They decorated the screen of the unusually located choir, which was demolished in 1564‚Äì1566, when they were detached and moved to the nave. They are now in the refectory, moved there after sustaining slight damage in the 1966 flood of the Arno. In the first move part of the frame with its inscriptions went lost, and all of Jerome's.Lightbown, 74‚Äì76; Legouix, 76 Deseption It portrays Augustine of Hippo in meditation inside his study. The precise subject is a legend, probably first found in the 13th century, of a vision Augustine had as he began to write a letter to Jerome in his study at Hippo in 420. The time is shown on the clock by his head as the end of the twenty-fourth hour, counting from the previous sunset. This is the hour of Compline, specified in the legend. A light and sweet odour came into his study and a voice told him that \\"he might as soon enclose the ocean in a small vessel, as soon clasp the whole earth in his fist, as soon halt the movement of the heavens as describe the beatitude of the saints without having experienced it\\", as the speaker was now doing. When Augustine asked who he was, he replied he was Jerome. Augustine later heard that Jerome had died in Jerusalem at exactly that hour.Lightbown, 76‚Äì77, 77 quoted The coat of arms visible in the upper part is that of the Vespucci family; Jerome has no equivalent arms.Lightbown, 77 The lines in the book over the saint's head are mostly meaningless, apart from a line in which reads: Dov'√® Frate Martino? √à scappato. E dov'√® andato? √à fuor dalla Porta al Prato (\\"Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato\\"), probably referring to the escapades of one of the Uumiliati, the order who ran the church. Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought \\"the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them\\".Lightbown, 77 (different translation to same effect) See also *Saint Augustine in His Study (Botticelli, Uffizi), a later version (1494) of the same subject *St. Augustine in His Study (Carpaccio) Notes References *Legouix, Susan, Botticelli, 2004 (revd edn), Chaucer Press, *Lightbown, Ronald, Sandro Botticelli: Life and Work, 1989, Thames and Hudson Category:1480 paintings Category:Fresco paintings Category:Paintings by Sandro Botticelli Category:Books in art Category:Paintings of Augustine of Hippo ","title":"Saint Augustine in His Study (Botticelli, Ognissanti)"},{"id":"11551951","text":"Nguy·ªÖn Thu Thu·ª∑ (born 1976 in Hanoi) was crowned the 4th Miss Vietnam in 1994 when she was a first year student at the Institute For International Relations in Hanoi.

The similitude principle was developed by Wallace D. Hayes, a pioneer in hypersonic flow, which is considered to begin at about five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5, and is described in his classic book Hypersonic Flow Theory co-written with Ronald Probstein and first published in 1959. The behavior of the physical processes in actual problems is affected by so many physical quantities that a complete mathematical description thereof is usually very difficult and sometimes practically impossible due to the complicated nature of the phenomena. We know from experience that if two systems are geometrically similar there usually exists some kind of similarity under certain conditions, such as kinematic similarity, dynamic similarity, thermal similarity, and similarity of concentration distribution, and that if similarity conditions are satisfied we can greatly reduce the number of independent variables required to describe the behavior of the process. In this way, we can systematically understand. describe, and even predict the behavior of physical processes in real problems in a relatively simple manner. This principle is known as principle of similitude. Dimensional analysis is a method of deducing logical groupings of the variables, through which we can describe similarity criteria of the processes. Physical quantities such as length [L], mass [M], time [T], and temperature are dimensional quantities and the magnitude of each quantity can be described by multiples of the unit of each dimension namely m, kg, s, and K, respectively. Through experience, we can select a certain number of fundamental dimensions, such as those mentioned above, and express all other dimensional quantities in terms of products of powers of these fundamental dimensions. Furthermore, in describing the behavior of physical processes, we know that there is an implicit principle that we cannot add or subtract physical quantities of different dimensions. This means that the equations governing physical processes must be dimensionally consistent and each term of the equation must have the same dimensions. This principle is known as the principle of dimensional homogeneity. (courtesy: Book: Mass transfer : from fundamentals to modern industrial applications, Publisher: Weinheim : WILEY-VCH, 2006.

Originally, mathematicians used the simpler calculus of earlier centuries to determine velocity, thrust, elevation, curve, distance, and other parameters. New weapons, however, such as Germany's giant cannons, the \\"Paris Gun\\" (Encyclopedia Astronautica) and \\"Big Bertha,\\" and the V-2 rocket, meant that projectiles would travel hundreds of miles in distance and dozens of miles in height, in all weathers. As a result, variables such as diminished wind resistance in thin atmospheres and changes in gravitational pull reduced accuracy using the historic methodology. There was the additional problem of planes that could now fly hundreds of miles an hour. Differential equations were applied to stochastic processes. Developing machines that could speed up human calculation of differential equations led in part to the creation of the modern computer through the efforts of Vannevar Bush, John von Neumann and others. According to Mary Croarken in her paper \\"Computing in Britain During World War II,\\" by 1945, the Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory created by John Lennard-Jones utilized the latest computing devices to perform the equations. These devices included a model \\"differential analyser,\\" and the Mallock machine, described as \\"an electrical simultaneous equation solver.\\" According to Croarken, the Ministry was also interested in the new arrival of a differential analyzer accommodating eight integrators. This exotic computing device built by Metropolitan-Vickers in 1939 consisted of wheel and disk mechanisms that could provide descriptions and solutions for differential equations. Output resulted in a plotted graph. At the same time, in the United States, analog computer pioneer Vannevar Bush took on a similar role to that of Lennard-Jones in the military effort after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt entrusted him with the bulk of wartime research into automatic control of fire power using machines and computing devices. According to Sarah Bergbreiter in her paper \\"Moving from Practice to Theory: Automatic Control after World War II,\\" fire control for the downing of enemy aircraft by anti- aircraft guns was the priority. The analog electro-mechanical computing machines plotted the differential firing data while servos created by H.L. Hazen adapted the data to the guns for precise firing control and accuracy. Other improvements of a similar type by Bell Labs increased firing stability so that output from the differential engines could be fully used to compensate for stochastic behaviors of enemy aircraft and large guns. A new age of intelligent warfare had begun. This work at MIT and Bell Labs would later lead to Norbert Wiener's development of the electronic computer and the science of cybernetics for the same purpose, speeding the differential calculation process exponentially and taking one more giant step toward the creation of the modern digital computer using von Neumann architecture. Dr. von Neumann was one of the original mathematicians employed in the development of differential equations for ballistic warfare.

The outer circle, discovered in 2005 by Jarrod Burks, is about in diameter. Robert Riordan, Professor of Archaeology at Wright State University and lead archaeologist investigating the site, estimates that about two hundred wooden posts were set in the outer circle. Following the 2009 Field Season though, this estimate will likely be reevaluated given a huge number of tightly spaced post-molds found on the geographic south of the feature. Thirty post-molds in all, were found in an eight meter long area excavated on the border of the circle. \\"A radiocarbon date on charcoal from a remnant trace of a post suggests it was built between 40 BC and AD 130.

The use or uses of the circles has not been determined, although it was likely ceremonial. Dr. Riordan named the circle in honor of Warren K. Moorehead, first curator of archaeology for the Ohio Historical Society and a leading North American archaeologist around the turn of the twentieth century, who was largely responsible for preservation of the Fort Ancient site.

He was the fifth Archbishop of Portland from 1966 to 1974, having previously served as the second Bishop of Reno (1952‚Äì66). Early life and education Dwyer was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, the only child of John Charles and Mabel (n√©e Maynard) Dwyer. His father was of Irish descent, and his mother of French Canadian. He attended Wasatch Public School and Judge Memorial High School. In 1925, he enrolled at the Marist Seminary in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Shortly afterwards, he transferred to St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, California. Priesthood On June 11, 1932, Dwyer was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Edward Kelly. He was the first native Utahn to be ordained a priest for the Diocese of Salt Lake City. His first assignment was as a curate at the Cathedral of the Madeleine, where he remained for two years. From 1934 to 1938, he served as chaplain at the College of Saint Mary-of-the-Wasatch and editor of The Intermountain Catholic. He was then sent to continue his studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1941 with a thesis entitled: \\"The Gentile Comes to Utah: A Study in Religious and Social Conflict 1862-1890\\". Following his return to Utah, Dwyer served as diocesan superintendent of Catholic schools (1941‚Äì52) and resumed his position as editor of the diocesan newspaper. He became diocesan director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith in 1942. He was named rector of the Cathedral of the Madeleine in 1948, and raised to the rank of Monsignor in 1950. Episcopacy He was appointed the second Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno in Reno, Nevada on May 19, 1952 by Pope Pius XII, and was consecrated August 5, 1952. Pope Paul VI appointed him the fifth Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland, in Portland, Oregon, on December 9, 1966. Retiring on January 22, 1974 due to ill health, he died in Piedmont, California on March 24, 1976.http://www.catholic- hierarchy.org/bishop/bdwyer.html http://www.archpdx.org/previous- archbishops/ab_dwyer.htm As a historian Dwyer began his work as a historian of the American west at the Catholic University of America, in Washington, D.C. in 1938, receiving his Ph.D. in history in 1941. His dissertation was published as The Gentile Comes to Utah: A Study in Religious and Social Conflict (1862-1890) and is considered an accomplished and objective work on the religious history of early Utah. Dwyer described Mormonism as an attempt to resurrect the idea of creating an ideal human order on earth. Sections of this work addressed the conflicts between the religious stance of Brigham Young, President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the antipolygamy crusade launched by the federal government (The Gentile Comes to Utah, p. 97, Topping, p. 40). Although his work as a historian was secondary to his religious calling, he served as a member of the governing and editorial boards of the Utah State Historical Society from 1943 to 1952. Dwyer periodically acted as editor to the Utah Historical Quarterly, and produced two noted volumes. In 1943, he edited work on the diary of Albert Tracy, a soldier in Albert Sidney Johnston's troops during the Utah War and in 1946 he edited a volume on Mormon pioneer Lorenzo Dow Young which contained a biography of Young by James Amasa Little, an edited diary of Lorenzo Dow Young and additional information on the pioneer's extensive family. After he became Archbishop, Dwyer became a member of the board of advisors of the Western History Center at the University of Utah.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Isle of Wight from 1924 to 1959. Early life One of nine children born to Mary and Ronald A MacDonald, he was born in Gillis Lake, Nova Scotia and attended Dalhousie College in Halifax. When World War I began, he left his studies and joined the Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force, November 1, 1915. He sailed aboard Metagama from St. John, New Brunswick 1 January, 1916 and arrived in Plymouth, England 10 January, 1916. He was promoted a Staff Sergeant February 1, 1916 at Sandgate, Kent. His army registration number as a member of the Canadian Expeditionary Force is 522023. He is listed as a S. Sergeant, occupation, accountant with CAPC, 6th Division, 63 battalion. Peter MacDonald was attached to the Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR) 27 August, 1916 for rations and Instructions. He ceased to be attached to the RCR 9 October, 1916, upon his evacuation to England injured. He was attached to No. 3, Canadian General Hospital in Boulogne, France when he came under intense shelling October 8, 1916 as a member of the 57th battalion. He was aided from the shelling with assistance walking but a right arm injury and contused back saw him returned to Norfolk War Hospital, Thorpe, Norwich, England. He was discharged from Convalescence Hospital, Woodcote Park, Epsom 27 November, 1916. He remained with CAPC until November 2, 1917 when he received a Lieutenant's commission to the Army Service Corps, ASC, Camp Aldershot. After training as an officer and a temporary gentlemanhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_gentlemen he served in the Army Pay Department (APD) until he was discharged from the army 13 March, 1918 to pursue his legal education at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. During the First World War he served in France, reaching the rank of Staff Sargeant. On 22 February 1918 he received a Commission to the Imperial Army. Political career At the 1923 general election he was chosen by the Conservatives to contest the Isle of Wight constituency as a Unionist candidate, and narrowly failed to unseat the sitting Liberal MP, J. E. B. Seely. Seely held the seat with a majority of 90 votes in a three-way contest, with the Labour Party candidate coming a distant third. When a further general election was called in 1924, MacDonald faced Seely and Labour candidate Weaver. MacDonald received 52% of the vote as a Unionist candidate. A marked swing to the Conservatives secured the large majority for MacDonald as he was elected to the House of Commons. He was parliamentary private secretary to Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, President of the Board of Trade from 1928-1929. During the Second World War, MacDonald saw service in 242 Squadron as Flight Officer and as Adjutant to Douglas Bader during the Battle of Britain. On the 24th June 1940 Bader was promoted to squadron leader and given command of No. 242 Squadron at Coltishall. After the Battle of Britain MacDonald, as MP, found himself embroiled in the \\"Big Wing\\" controversy. Bader and Leigh-Mallory were proponents while, Dowding and Park were not. Dowding and Park were the commanders overseeing the British victory in the Battle of Britain. It seemed a conspiracy engineered the downfall of Air Chief-Marshal Hugh Dowding, head of Fighter Command, and Air Vice-Marshal Keith Park commander of 11 Group. Park was responsible for Battle of Britain command decisions from Operations Command at Uxbridge. MacDonald left 242 Squadron to accept a transfer to the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, reaching the rank of squadron leader. MacDonald held a number of positions within the parliamentary Conservative Party including holding the chair of the Imperial Affairs Committee for more than 20 years. He also took part in a number of inter-parliamentary bodies, and was vice-chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (British Group) in 1945‚Äì1947. He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Dissolution Honours of 1945. MacDonald retired from parliament at the 1959 general election. Death He died following a riding accident near his home, Ningwood Manor, Yarmouth, Isle of Wight in December 2, 1961. He was cremated. His ashes were interred in Shalfleet Churchyard, Shalfleet, Isle of Wight Dec 9, 1961.(4) Personal life He was twice married: his first wife was Lady Jean Hervey, daughter of the Earl of Dundonald.

He studied Law at Lund University and was a professor of law at the University of Uppsala from 1914 to 1947. Like H√§gerstr√∂m, Karl Olivecrona and Alf Ross, he resists the exposition of rights as metaphysical entities, arguing that realistic legal analysis should dispense with them. Lundstedt's main focus in his theoretical work became a sustained attack on what he called the method of justice. He considered that there was no objective way to define the requirements of justice and that invocations of justice cloaked purely subjective preferences or unacceptable metaphysical claims. Instead, law and legislation should be guided by a method of social welfare centred on objective study of social conditions and of the practical effects and capabilities of law in improving society for all its members. Lundstedt was a member of the Swedish parliament for many years and promoted within it changes to the penal system and a range of other liberal reforms.

Environmental studies have revealed the lake has been uniquely stable for thousands of years. Blue Lake was the focus for research on environmental change in which numerous indicators such as water discharge, water quality, pollen and algae samples were examined to understand the history of the lake. In 1980, the lake was described in the entry on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate for the Blue Lake National Park as follows: > Blue Lake is a watertable lake in the coastal sandmass of North Stradbroke > Island. Although only relatively small, Blue Lake contains a diversity of > habitats & species, including: Blue Lake, a boomerang-shaped watertable > window lake; Tortoise Lagoon, a perched lake receding to swamp that > fluctuates between swamp and a lagoon depending on rainfall; and other > swamps; examples of dry sclerophyll forest, scrub heath, marshes, > herbfields, associated linear swamps with surrounding eucalypt open forest > and mallee heath.

CAI.100). Sitter and author The identification of the sitter is based on the old, but probably not original, inscription on the windowsill at the bottom of the picture Smeralda di M.Bandinelli Moglie di VI...

Baccio Bandinelli and art at the Medici court It has been suggested that the portrait was painted by one of Botticelli's assistants during the 1470s. William Michael Rossetti said: \\"Leading critics will now have it that the portrait is not the work of Botticelli himself, but of someone for whom they have invented the name 'Amico di Sandro'\\". The Victoria & Albert Museum attributes the painting to Botticelli himself.

Composition Art historians point out changing conventions of portraiture in Botticelli's painting: \\"earlier Florentine portraits were in profile. The woman's three-quarter pose, with her hand on the window frame, was Botticelli's own invention.\\" The portrait is thought to be the first example of a three-quarter pose in Florentine portrait painting. \\"By abandoning the profile pose traditionally used in depictions of Renaissance women, Botticelli brought a new sense of movement into the portrait.\\" The painting helped art historians to identify the sheer overdress worn by the Mona Lisa, a \\"similar\\" guarnello. The sitter also wears a cotta, a light summer gown. Provenance By the early 19th century (1805) the portrait was in the collection of Comte James de Pourtal√®s Gorgier (1776‚Äì1855) in Paris.

Background \\"Moonlight Serenade\\" released as Army V-Disc 39A, VP 75, Theme Song, by the U.S. War Department in November 1943 Miller studied the Schillinger technique with Joseph Schillinger,\\"Joseph Schillinger, the forgotten Guru\\", The Schillinger School of Music who is credited with helping Miller create the \\"Miller sound\\", and under whose tutelage he composed \\"Moonlight Serenade\\"., The Schillinger System. The song evolved from a 1935 version entitled \\"Now I Lay Me Down to Weep\\", with music by Glenn Miller and lyrics by Eddie Heyman to a version called \\"Gone with the Dawn\\" with lyrics by George Simon,Simon, George T. Glenn Miller and his Orchestra, pp, 71-72. and \\"The Wind in the Trees\\" with lyrics by Mitchell Parish. In his biography of Glenn Miller, George T. Simon recounted how vocalist Al Bowlly of the Ray Noble Orchestra sang him the Eddie Heyman lyrics to the Glenn Miller music of \\"Now I Lay Me Down to Weep\\" in 1935. The Noble Orchestra never recorded the song. Finally it ended up as \\"Moonlight Serenade\\" because Robbins Music bought the music and learned that Miller was recording a cover of \\"Sunrise Serenade\\", a Frankie Carle associated song for RCA Victor. They thought \\"Moonlight\\" would be a natural association for \\"Sunrise\\".Simon. pp. 162‚Äì163. Jazz critic Gary Giddins wrote about the song's impact and legacy; \\"Miller exuded little warmth on or off the bandstand, but once the band struck up its theme, audiences were done for: throats clutched, eyes softened. Can any other record match 'Moonlight Serenade' for its ability to induce a Pavlovian slobber in so many for so long?\\" (The New Yorker, May 24, 2004).

A V-Disc test pressing of a recording of the song from November 17, 1945 by the AAF Band was made but the disc was not issued.

This greatly enhanced the development of supersonic flight and supersonic aircraft design. In a series of publications beginning in 1947 with his Ph.D. thesis under Theodore von K√°rm√°n at the California Institute of TechnologyWallace Hayes obituary , he developed a theory of supersonic flow called the area rule which strongly influenced the design of high-speed aircraft. His work also provided the first understanding of the behavior of delta wing aircraft flying just above the speed of sound. He followed his work in supersonic flow with groundbreaking studies in the late 1940s and early 1950s in hypersonic flow, which is considered to begin at about five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. He developed the Hayes similitude principle, which enabled designers to take the results of one series of tests or calculations and apply them to the design of an entire family of similar configurations where neither tests nor detailed calculations are available. Many of his developments appeared in his book Hypersonic Flow Theory, co-written with Ronald Probstein and first published in 1959. He made important contributions to the understanding of sonic booms and served on numerous NASA advisory committees on the subject. Hayes was born in Beijing, China and educated in California where he received his B.S. in physics in 1941 and his Ph.D. in physics, magna cum laude, in 1947 from the California Institute of Technology. His work in the aircraft industry began in 1939 with Consolidated Aircraft and continued during World War II as an aerodynamicist with North American Aviation. From 1952 to 1954 he was scientific liaison officer with the Office of Naval Research in London. In 1954, he came to Princeton University, where he taught until 1989. He also taught at the California Institute of Technology, Brown University, Delft Technical University, and the University of New Mexico at Holloman Air Force Base. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Physical Society(Fellow, 1986) and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, which honored him in 1965 with its Research Award. Hayes was an active member of the Sierra Club since 1942 and an avid outdoor sports enthusiast enjoying rock-climbing, hiking, water sports, and skiing. He was also a glider and small airplane flight instructor. He died on March 2, 2001, in Hightstown, New Jersey at age 82.

Via the Minnesota River, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of in an agricultural region. The river's name is a translation of the Sioux name for the river, Waraju, for the cottonwood tree, which is common along prairie rivers. It has also been known historically as the Big Cottonwood River. The Cottonwood River flows generally eastwardly throughout its course. It rises southwest of Balaton in Rock Lake Township in southern Lyon County, as an intermittent stream on the Coteau des Prairies, a morainic plateau dividing the Mississippi and Missouri River watersheds. The river flows off the Coteau in a wooded valley in southeastern Lyon County, dropping 200 feet (60 m) in five miles (3 km), and enters a region of till plains, flowing through southern Redwood County, the northeastern corner of Cottonwood County, and northern Brown County, past the communities of Sanborn and Springfield. It enters a wooded valley near its mouth, flowing through Flandrau State Park and entering the Minnesota River just southeast of New Ulm. The river was formerly dammed to form a lake in the state park, but the dam was not rebuilt after being washed out by floods in 1965 and 1969. Due to the northeastward slope of the Coteau des Prairies and the presence of a terminal moraine along the northern side of the river, very few tributaries enter the Cottonwood River from the north. The largest is Sleepy Eye Creek, 51 miles (82 km) long, which flows eastwardly through Redwood and Brown Counties, past Cobden. Tributaries from the south include Plum Creek, 35 miles (56 km) long, which flows northeastwardly through Murray and Redwood Counties, past Walnut Grove; and Dutch Charley Creek, 46 miles (74 km) long, which flows northeastwardly through Murray, Cottonwood, and Redwood Counties. Approximately 84% of land in the Cottonwood River watershed is used for agriculture; the predominant crops are corn and soybeans. Wetlands in the watershed have been extensively drained, and fewer than 4,000 acres (16 km¬≤) remain. Flow rate At the United States Geological Survey's stream gauge near New Ulm, 3.2 miles (5.2 km) upstream from the river's mouth, the annual mean flow of the river between 1909 and 2005 was 381 cubic feet per second (11 m¬≥/s). The highest recorded flow during the period was 28,700 ft¬≥/s (813 m¬≥/s) on April 10, 1969. The lowest recorded flow was 0.5 ft¬≥/s (0 m¬≥/s) on November 27, 1952.

The Finnish‚ÄìNovgorodian wars were a series of conflicts between Finnic tribes in eastern Fennoscandia and the Republic of Novgorod from the 11th or 12th century to the early 13th century. The wars' effect on the Finns' society contributed to the eventual Swedish conquest of western Finland in around 1249. The term used in Russian chronicles to refer to Novgorod's enemy, Yem, is unclear and probably referred to several different groups, even though etymologically it derives from the Finnish word H√§me, which means Tavastia. Some of the groups identified as Yem may have been the inhabitants of Tavastland in south-central Finland, the West Finns in general,About the association of the term Yem with Finns, see Suomen varhaiskeskiajan l√§hteit√§. Historian aitta XXI. Gummerus kirjapaino Oy. Jyv√§skyl√§ 1989. . or a sub-group of Karelians on the northern coast of the Ladoga who descended from western Finns who had moved to the area earlier.Pirjo Uino: Ancient Karelia: Archaeological Studies. Helsinki 1997. Early developments The only known written sources on the Yem-Novgorodian wars are contained in the medieval Russian chronicles. The Russians and Yem had frequent conflicts from the 11th or 12th century onwards. The eastern Finnic Votes, Korela (interpreted as Karelians in general or more specifically as the Karelians on the southwest coast of the Ladoga) and Izhorians are all mentioned as allies of Novgorod, said to have been fighting against the Yem even without Novgorod's direct involvement, possibly over control of land area in central and eastern Finland; this territorial feud manifested in annual retaliatory expeditions that featured merciless treatment of the settlers of the opposing tribe. The earliest possible mention of hostilities is from the Laurentian Codex which records in passing that the Novgorodian Prince Vladimir Yaroslavich was at war with the \\"Yam\\" in 1042 AD.. In Swedish. Hosted by the National Archive of Finland. See and Diplomatarium Fennicum from the menu. The Yam are also mentioned as tributaries to Novgorod in the Primary Chronicle,Primary Chronicle. In Russian. but they disappear from sources later on.At the time of the conflict, Sweden still controlled access to the Baltic Sea. Also, the Primary Chronicle does not mention the Karelians or Izhorians who lived between Russians and Finns. Furthermore, the said Vladimir attacked Constantinople in 1043, making it unlikely that he was fighting on the other side of the continent only a year earlier. Conflicts certainly began in the early 12th century, however information on them remains very scarce. According to the Novgorod First Chronicle, another Prince of Novgorod, Vsevolod Mstislavich, and his troops from Novgorod were at war with Yem during a great famine in 1123. The chronicle leaves any further developments of the conflict open, including the whereabouts of the fight.Novgorod First Chronicle entry about the war, . In Swedish. 13th-century Novgorod as represented in Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky (1938). Yem pillaged Novgorodian territory in 1142, but were defeated near Ladoga with 400 casualties. Coincidentally or not, Swedes attacked the Novgorodians in the same year as well.See . In Swedish. The Korela, now under Novgorodian influence, were at war with Yem in the following year, but were forced to flee, losing two ships.Novgorod First Chronicle entries about Finnish wars, , . In Swedish. Yem attacked Russian soil again in 1149 with 1000 men. Novgorodians, totaling 500, went in pursuit of the Yem, utterly defeating them with Votes, a Finnic tribe in alliance with Novgorod. Votes, today almost extinct, lived south of the present-day Saint Petersburg, probably making this the deepest attack that Yem ever made into Russian territory.Novgorod First Chronicle entry about the war, . After a long pause in open hostilities‚Äîat least in the chronicles‚Äîa Novgorodian called Vyshata Vasilyevich led his troops against Yem in 1186, returning unharmed with prisoners. It is not clear whether he took his forces to fight in the land of Yem or to defend his country against an intrusion. Reasons for the renewed fighting have not been identified.Novgorod First Chronicle entries about the war, . In Swedish. Korela accompanied Novgorodians for yet another attack against the Yem in 1191. This time the fighting is clearly said to have taken place \\"the land of the Yem\\", the first such entry in Russian chronicles. The assailants \\"burned the country and killed the cattle\\".Novgorod First Chronicle entries about the war, . In Swedish. Very hypothetically this may have been the same attack that was mentioned in a much later Swedish chronicle, the mid-16th century Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium by Bishop Paulus Juusten, that records the Russians burning \\"Turku\\" in 1198, at the time of Bishop Folquinus.The chronicle has been published in Finnish, see e.g. Suomen piispainkronikka. Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seuran toimituksia 476. Pieks√§m√§ki 1988. Russian chronicles have no information about a conflict that year. The town of Turku did not exist before the end of the 13th century. After this, there is no information on further Novgorodian conflicts for several decades. It is also impossible to confirm whether the 1191 war resulted in a brief Novgorodian rule in parts of Finland or Karelia. However, a later chronicle entry from the mid-1220s said that Russian princes had not been able to dwell in the land of Yem. Swedish and Papal involvement? At the same time, Sweden and Novgorod were in conflict as well. Pope Alexander III, in his letter to the Archbishop of Uppsala and Jarl Gottorm of Sweden in 1171 (or 1172), perhaps refers to the Finns' struggle against Novgorod by demanding Sweden take over Finnish fortresses in exchange for protection. in 1171 (or 1172). In Latin. In the late 15th century, historian Ericus Olai claimed that Bishop Kol of Link√∂ping (died c. 1196) had been the \\"Jarl of Finland\\" (Dux Finlandiae),Suomen Museo 2002. See page 66. The book can be ordered from the Finnish Antiquarian Society. Note that the Latin word \\"Dux\\" came to mean \\"Duke\\" only in the late 13th century and was used in the meaning of Jarl earlier. possibly leading Swedish troops temporarily situated in Finland. He may have been in a military role similar to that of Jon Jarl, who allegedly spent nine years overseas fighting against Novgorodians and Ingrians at the end of the 12th century.Suomen museo 2002. See page 65. Ericus Olai may also have made a mistake, since Jon Jarl is apparently buried in the Cathedral of Link√∂ping, thus making him the Jarl of Finland instead of Bishop Kol. Also noteworthy is the so-called First Swedish Crusade, which, according to several 15th-century sources, took place in 1150.Note, however, that several historians from the early 20th century onwards have tried to date the crusade to 1155, with some questionable lines of argument. See Heikkil√§, Tuomas. Pyh√§n Henrikin legenda. Karisto Oy H√§meenlinna 2005. . The crusade is only known from later legends that presented the expedition (if it ever took place) as a Christian mission, headed by a saint king to baptize heathens. However, it seems to have followed the exceptionally edgy 1140s with both the Yem and Swedes fighting against Novgorod. Some historians have seen it as a direct reaction to the failed Yem expedition in 1149, associating it with the co- operation mentioned by the Pope 20 years later.Linna, Martti. Suomen alueellinen pyhimyskultti ja vanhemmat aluejaot. Vesilahti 1346-1996. Jyv√§skyl√§ 1996. See page 197. In 1221, Pope Honorius III was again worried about the situation after receiving alarming information from the Archbishop of Uppsala. He authorized the unnamed Bishop of Finland to establish a trade embargo against the \\"barbarians\\" that threatened the Christianity in Finland. in 1221. In Latin. The nationality of the \\"barbarians\\", presumably a citation from Archbishop's earlier letter, remains unknown, and was not necessarily known even by the Pope. However, as the trade embargo was widened eight years later, it was specifically said to be against the Russians.See papal letters from 1229 to and . In Latin. Russian sources mention Swedish-Yem co-operation in 1240 at the earliest; it was then that As \\"Yems\\" and \\"Sums\\", possibly separating Tavastians and the coastal Finns which from then on was customary in Russian sources until the early 14th century. were mentioned as one of the Swedes' allies in the little-documented Battle of the Neva. The first reliable mention of Yem being a part of Swedish forces is from 1256,. In Swedish. seven years after the conventional dating of the so-called Second Swedish Crusade. Final war The final known conflict between Yem and Novgorod took place in the 1220s, following decades of peace, at least in the chronicles. After having secured his power in Novgorod by 1222, Grand Prince Yaroslav II of Vladimir organized a series of attacks against Estonia, Yem and Karelia. The offensive against Yem took place in winter 1226‚Äì27. > The same winter Yaroslav, son of Vsevolod left Novgorod over the sea against > Yem where no else Russian prince had been able to dwell; and he conquered > the land and returned to Novgorod praising God with many prisoners. When > those who were accompanying him could not handle all the prisoners, they > killed some of them but released many more. from the Laurentian Codex. In > Swedish. The Yem retaliatory expedition in summer 1228 against Ladoga, allegedly with more than 2000 menThe figure sounds high. The usual Swedish ledung had just 2500 men which would mean that less organized Yem were able to establish a similar naval force. Total population in Finland at the time is estimated to have been 50 000 at the maximum. See Suomen museo 2002 (), page 85. ended in disaster, as described by the Novgorod First Chronicle. Ladoga castle (here in its 15th-century appearance) repelled the Yem forces in 1228. > The Yem came to Lake Ladoga to war, and word about that came to Novgorod on > the Ascension Day of the Christ (6.8). And Novgorodians took their barges > and rowed to Ladoga with prince Jaroslav.

Many of them fell there, but their boats were burned.  And of > those who had come, 2000 or more were killed, God knows; and the rest (who > had not fled) were all killed.. In Swedish. The war seems to have been the end of independent Yem-Novgorodian conflicts. Based on Papal letters from 1229,See letters by Pope Gregory IX: , , , , , , . All in Latin. the unknown Bishop of Finland took advantage of the chaotic situation by taking over non-Christian places of worship and moving the see to a \\"more suitable\\" location. On the bishop's request, the Pope also enforced a trade embargo against Novgorodians on the Baltic Sea, at least in Visby, Riga and L√ºbeck. A few years later, the Pope also requested the Livonian Brothers of the Sword send troops to protect Finland. Whether any knights ever arrived remains unknown.. In Latin. Novgorodian wars were a factor contributing to the eventual Swedish conquest of Finland around 1249.See e.g. Suomen historian pikkuj√§ttil√§inen. WSOY 1987. . Pages 55-59.

Family and marriage  He was the son of Gale Yges Galama and Trijn Douwesdr Harinxma. The marriage of Gale and Trijn was an attempt to create a provisional peace between the warring factions of the Vetkopers and Schieringers. Gale came from a Vetkoper line and Trijn from a line of Schieringers. Ygo Gales Galama was married to Goslinga. The marriage is mentioned in the ‚ÄúStamboek van de Friese Adel\\", which traces the genealogy and history of the Frisian nobility.Stamboek van den Frieschen, vroegeren en lateren, adel, uit oude en echte bescheiden en aanteekeningen, en met bijvoeging van de wapens der onderscheidene geslachten, opgemaakt, by Montanus de Haan Hettema; A van Halmael, Jr.; H van Ryn Publisher: Leeuwarden : Meindersma, 1846. The couple possessed fortified homes at Koudum, Hemelum and Oudega. From this marriage they had four children: Trijn, Otto, Maaike and Juw.Langenaberg Family Genealogy  The forest viking  Ygo was a rich, powerful and war-skilled Vetkoper with a notorious reputation. To his compatriots he was known as ‚Äúthe forest viking‚Äô but to his enemies het woudzwijn, the ‚Äòforest swine‚Äô.  Late middle-ages  The late Middle Ages were an important period in the development of Friesland. Monks ensured dike construction, new agriculture methods and an increase of written sources. Some of the oldest records of Frisian text originate from this period. The eleven Frisian cities got their town rights, trade contacts were extended and a money economy arose. The 14th and 15th centuries however were dominated by fighting between competing noble families. The cause of the fighting, aligned along two monastical orders, the Schieringers and Vetkopers, was due to complex family relations in which family loyalty, honour and blood revenge played an important role. In particular the fighting took place between important noble families and the influential monasteries. The Schieringers had their largest group of followers in Westergo. The Vetkopers had their power base in the east of the province. The name Schieringers refers to the grey garments of the Cistercians (Middle Dutch schiere = grey). The Vetkopers (\\"buyers of fat\\" ‚Äì trading in butter, cheese etc.) were associated with the Norbertines, who supposedly obtained their income from livestock- farming. In 1439 the factionalism which had abated for some years started once again in Gaasterland: the Vetkoper Galamas against the Schieringer Harinxmas. A violent conflict that continued until 1456. The dispute in Oostergo (1441‚Äì1444) was settled through a court of law under the influence of Groningen. On August 15, 1456, the threat of Duke Philip the Good led to a new alliance against all landlords and the formation of a council ‚Äòof the Common Land of Vrieslandt‚Äô. Shortly thereafter the Donia War (1458‚Äì1463) began, followed by an explosion of other disputes; the towns Sneek now played a large role, some actively, some passively (Dokkum 1470, the Beer Uproar of Leeuwarden in 1487). Attempts by the Emperor to settle the dispute proved fruitless. Holland could not supply the Vetkopers the help they needed, from which the Groningers profited until they themselves were defeated while laying siege to Franeker and had to abandon Westergo (1496).  Later years and death  The arrival of duke Albrecht in 1498 ensured a central authority that not only provided a visible presence, but also provided clear legislation and jurisdiction. The duke introduced general governing board measures, such as laws and taxes. The arrival of Albrecht and the setting-up of a governing board appropriate for Friesland however did not go without problems.

She is writing the opening of the Magnificat on the right-hand page of a book; on the left page is part of the Benedictus. In her left hand she holds a pomegranate. Mary is thought to be a portrait of Lucrezia Tornabuoni, wife of Piero de' Medici, and the two angels holding the book to be her sons Lorenzo and Giuliano. In his book 'The Agony and The Ecstasy', about Michelangelo's life, the writer Irving Stone, who spent several years living in Florence, Italy, claims that the painting was actually made for the Medici family at the time. History The history of the painting is not known. It was acquired by the Uffizi in 1785 from Ottavio Magherini. It may have come from one of the many monasteries suppressed by the Archduke Pietro Leopoldo. It has been identified with the tondo in the church of San Francesco al Monte mentioned by Vasari and Bocchi, but the description does not coincide and this identification is usually rejected.

Early years Edward Holden was born at College Town (now St. Peters), the son of saddler and carriage-maker Henry James Holden (1859‚Äì1926) and his wife Mary Ann (n√©e Wheewall). He was educated at Prince Alfred College and the University of Adelaide, where he graduated with a B.Sc. in 1905 and joined the family firm Holden & Frost.Healey, John (ed.) S.A. Greats: The Men and Women of the North Terrace Plaques Historical Society of South Australia 2003 Career Edward saw the necessity for the firm to diversify into motor vehicles, initially maintaining and repairing (imported) automobile bodies then building motorcycle sidecars in a shed at the rear of the firm's Grenfell Street premises. In 1917 the Australian Government introduced policies to restrict importation of fully manufactured motor cars to encourage the country's nascent automotive body building industry. Holden developed a relationship with America's General Motors (as Adelaide contemporary T. J. Richards did with Chrysler) to fit bodies to imported chassis. In 1919 Edward (as managing director) and his father founded a company Holden's Motor Body Builders with a factory at 400 King William Street later occupied by A. G. Healing Ltd.Sands and McDougall's Directory (1962 edition) In 1923, following the signing of an exclusive agreement in Detroit with General Motors by Edward Holden, a new factory was set up at 879-895 Port Road, Cheltenham, employing the latest in production line technology. Automated mass-production techniques increased productivity spectacularly. Edward Holden introduced to the business new standards of scientific management, cost accounting and production control. In close association with General Motors Export Co., Holdens established a dominant market position throughout mainland Australia. By 1929 the company employed 3,400 workers and was the biggest automotive bodybuilder in the British Empire. In October 1929 the plant closed temporarily for lack of continuous work, and in January 1930 Holden set out for the United States to discuss amalgamation with General Motors. In February 1931, General Motors offered ¬£1,116,000 for Holden's, which was ultimately accepted. This reduced the cash burden of the merger for General Motors, while giving it complete control while maintaining an Australian character in name, ownership and management. Holden was appointed Executive Chairman of Directors and joint Managing Director of General Motors-Holden's Ltd. in August 1931 and later sole Managing Director. He was supplanted as managing director in 1934 by Laurence Hartnett but remained Chairman until ill health forced his resignation in January 1947. The advent of World War II saw a rapid switch of the motor body building plant at Woodville to war production. Early in 1941 it was almost fully committed to war production, and it was employing 20% more people than were on the normal peacetime payroll. He became honorary Controller-General of Army Canteens in 1939‚Äì45 and visited troops in the Middle East. The profits from army canteens, which were immense, initially went to improve camp facilities and the surplus of around ¬£2,000,000 realised by the end of the war was distributed by the Australian Military Forces Special Benefits Committee to organisations whose membership was restricted to service personnel. Holden was sued for damages and taking bribes, but the case lapsed for lack of evidence. Edward Holden was also prominent in many South Australian enterprises: *Adelaide Cement Co. (including chairman of directors) *Alma Shoes (including chairman of directors) *Australian Cotton Textile Industries Limited (ACTIL) *The Bank of Adelaide *Colton, Palmer and Preston Ltd. (including chairman of directors) *South Australian Brush Company (SABCO) (including chairman of directors) *The Council of the University of Adelaide *South Australian Industries Assistance Corporation *Adelaide Chamber of Commerce *The National Safety Council *The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation *South Australian Chamber of Manufactures (and president from 1936 to 1939) *Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia. Politics He served for three years as councillor and alderman with the Adelaide City Council. In 1936 he was defeated in a bid to oust the sitting mayor, J. R. Cain. In 1935 he was elected to the Central District No.2 seat in the Legislative Council of South Australia made vacant by the death of Labor's William Humphrey Harvey. Holden was a strong supporter of Premier Tom Playford's push to industrialize South Australia. Honours In the New Year's Honours List of 1946, he was created a Knight Bachelor. Death He died in North Adelaide of cerebro-vascular disease on 17 June 1947, aged 61, and was survived by his wife, Hilda May (n√©e Lavis), a son and two daughters. One of those daughters was Senator Dame Nancy Buttfield, the first woman to represent South Australia in the Parliament of Australia.

The order for the Woomera was cancelled before it became operational with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Design and development In early 1939, the Australian Government ordered large numbers of Bristol Beaufort bombers, with major components to be built in a variety of locations, including railway workshops, and in doing so it by-passed the local aircraft company, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation. CAC, under Sir Lawrence Wackett, began work on its own design, hoping to out-perform the Beaufort by building a machine that could serve as both a torpedo-bomber and dive bomber.Ewer 2009 Chapter 6 To keep down weight, Wackett dispensed with traditional self-sealing fuel tanks and opted to make the wing cavities liquid-tight, and thus serve as fuel storage. The Australian Government was initially uninterested in the CAC design. However, in mid-1940, cut off from the supply of British-made components for the Beaufort program (thanks to a British embargo on the export of aviation products, due to the need to maximise British production during the Battle of Britain), the Australian Government ordered a prototype of the CAC design, even before the Royal Australian Air Force had expressed a view about the machine.Ewer, 2009, p169 This prototype CA-4 took to the air on 19 September 1941. The CA-4 was a low-wing, twin-engined, multi-role bomber with a crew of three. It was armed with four nose-mounted .303 calibre machine guns and two remote-controlled twin machine-guns barbette mounted at the rear of the engine nacelles. It could carry either bombs, bombs or two torpedoes. It was originally powered by two Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp R-1830-S3C3-G radials. Unfortunately, the novel fuel tanks never proved reliable, and in January 1943 the CA-4 prototype was completely destroyed in a mid-air explosion, probably due to a fuel leak. With a re-designed tail and rudder, and an improved nose armament of two 20 mm cannon and two .303 calibre machine guns, the CA-4 became the CA-11 Woomera. Production Faced with the crisis caused by the Japanese entry into the war in December 1941, the RAAF accepted the design even before testing was complete, and ordered 105 examples of the CAC bomber on 8 March 1942. However, after the loss of the CA-4 prototype, the redesigned CA-11 did not fly until June 1944. By the time production was due to commence, the dive-bombing concept had fallen into disfavour and the RAAF was filling the light bomber/reconnaissance/strike role with British-designed Bristol Beaufighters (which were being made in Australia by the Department of Aircraft Production); US-made bombers, including the B-25 Mitchell, had also become available. Consequently, the original Woomera order was reduced from 105 to 20. After the first CA-11 flew, the whole program was cancelled and the production capacity set aside for Woomeras at CAC was switched to P-51 Mustang fighters. The only completed CA-11 Woomera, A23-1, was stripped for parts and scrapped in 1946. =Loss of CA-4= On 15 January 1943, the prototype CA-4, A23-1001, crashed on a test flight to assess powerplant performance and evaluate aerodynamic effects of a new fixed leading edge slat. During the return to the CAC airfield at Fisherman's Bend, the pilot, Squadron Leader Jim Harper, had detected a fuel leak in the port Pratt & Whitney R-1830 engine. As the problem worsened he attempted to shut down the engine, feathering the propeller; however, the actuation of the feathering switch caused an explosion and uncontrollable fire. The three-man crew subsequently attempted evacuation at , yet only Harper succeeded in parachuting free, while the CAC test pilot Jim Carter and power plant group engineer Lionel Dudgeon were both killed. The airframe subsequently impacted south-west of Kilmore, Victoria. The wreckage was recovered and used for components.Isaacs, Grp. Capt.

It is particularly associated with the Sorrento Peninsula and Monti Lattari. It derives from cross-breeding of indigenous Podolica cattle with Italian Holstein-Friesian, Bruna Italiana and Jersey cattle. It is one of the sixteen minor Italian cattle breeds of limited diffusion recognised and protected by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali, the Italian ministry of agriculture. History The Agerolese derives from cross-breeding of indigenous grey Podolica cattle with a variety of imported breeds including Friesian, Braunvieh and Jersey. The earliest such importation may have been by the Bourbon kings of Naples, who in the eighteenth century imported breeding stock of various breeds to improve the local grey cattle. It seems that when in 1845 the adventurer and soldier General Paolo Avitabile returned from England to his native Agerola, he brought with him Jersey cattle, which were added to the local stock. Other later crosses have included Bretonne Pie Noir, Bruna Italiana and Frisona Italiana (Italian Friesian). The breed was officially recognised and named \\"Agerolese\\" in 1952, and the breed standard was approved in the same year. At that time the breed numbered 2760 head. A census of the breed completed on 1 January 2002 found a total of 200 head, of which 103 were adult (18 bulls and 85 cows). In 2007 the conservation status of the breed was reported by the FAO as \\"endangered-maintained\\". At the end of 2012 a total population of 347 head was reported, including 18 breeding bulls and 252 breeding cows. Characteristics Agerolese cows are brown, and bulls almost black; both have a pale dorsal stripe. The tip of the muzzle is whitish, the horns are of medium size. Height at the withers is for males, for females; weight is for bulls, for cows. Use The milk yield of the Agerolese is about for primiparous and for pluriparous cows. Cows may give per day of milk with more than 3.5% fat. It is used to make butter and Italian cheeses such as Fior di Latte and Provolone del Monaco. This last has DOP status; it is made only in thirteen comuni of the province of Naples (Agerola, Casola di Napoli, Castellammare di Stabia, Gragnano, Lettere, Massa Lubrense, Meta, Piano di Sorrento, Pimonte, Sant'Agnello, Sorrento, Santa Maria la Carit√† and Vico Equense), and must contain a minimum of 20% Agerolese milk.

It is native to South America, where it occurs in Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil. This species is arboreal, living in the vegetation of the Gran Chaco. It breeds during the rainy season. It lays eggs along the middle of a leaf blade and folds the leaf, sandwiching the eggs inside. Its nest is attached to a branch suspended over a stream, so the hatching tadpoles drop into the water.Frazer, J.F.D. (1973) Amphibians.

She is best known for her research and publications on the glycemic index, a term originated by David J. Jenkins of the University of Toronto, and its role in human health. Her research interests focus on all aspects of carbohydrates‚Äîdiet and diabetes, the glycemic index of foods, insulin resistance, lactose intolerance and oligosaccharides in infant nutrition. Brand-Miller holds a special interest in evolutionary nutrition and the diet of Australian Aborigines. As a nutrition lecturer in 1981, she was investigating Aboriginal bushfood when she came across the glycemic index, a nutritional concept devised by David J. Jenkins and colleagues from the University of Toronto. The glycemic index has since changed the way the world thinks about food, nutrition and dieting. Brand-Miller has played a major role in educating the community on the glycemic index. Her books about the low GI diet, including The New Glucose Revolution, have sold more than two million copies since 1996. The most recent title in the series, The Low GI Diet, was published in September 2004. She has published 16 books and 200 journal articles. She has come under attack by economist Rory Robertson over her argument that added sugar consumption in Australia has declined in recent decades at the same time rates of obesity increased, which she has dubbed the Australian paradox. Recent research by GreenPool Commodity Specialists for the Australian Sugar Refiners, using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS \\"extended series\\") methodology, has confirmed that apparent consumption of sugar has decreased in Australia over the past few decades. It is worth noting that the ABS is now looking into re- establishing the collection of Apparent Consumption data for Australia. In addition to this, new research by Levy and Shrapnel has confirmed that added sugar from soft drinks has continued to decline, and finally the Australian Governments latest Health Survey indicates that total sugar consumption has decreased from 1995 - 2011/12. Following an investigation prompted by the Australian economist, two minor arithmetical errors were identified in the original manuscript of The Australian Paradox which were promptly corrected in early 2014. This was the only allegation out of 8 others that was substantiated. Similarly, complaints about the scientific journal Nutrients publication of The Australian Paradox paper were not substantiated.

C29 was involved in the use of the U-boat trap tactic. The tactic was to use a decoy trawler to tow a submarine. When a U-boat was sighted, the tow line and communication line was slipped and the submarine would attack the U-boat. The tactic was partly successful, but was abandoned after the loss of two C-class submarines. In both cases, all the crew were lost. C29 was one of the two C-class submarines sunk while attempting to employ the tactic; she was mined when her trawler Ariadne strayed into a minefield in the Humber Estuary on 29 August 1915.

Mycosphaerella melonis, is an ascomycete fungal plant pathogen that causes Gummy stem blight on the family Cucurbitaceae [1-3]. The anamorph/asexual stage for this fungus is called Phoma cucurbitacearum [2]. This pathogen commonly affects the foliage and stems of plants from the family Cucurbitaceae (the family of gords and melons), which includes cantaloupe, cucumber, muskmelon and watermelon plants [1,3,8]. When this pathogen infects the fruit of cucurbits it is called black rot [2]. Host Symptoms * Gray- green to black circular leaf spots * Angular/target-like water-soaked lesions * Stem lesions/cankers * Vine lesions * Vine Necrosis * Reddish gummy ooze exuding from the lesions/wounds * Wilt * Defoliation The first symptoms appear as grayish green, circular spots between the veins of the leaf lobes [1]. With age these spots darken to brown and black [1,2]. Lesions begin to develop on vines at the vine nodes and then elongate into water-soaked streaks, and these streaks are pale brown at first but turn gray with time [1]. Eventually all infected vines will become necrotic and occasionally the plant dies due to wilting and defoliation [1,7]. Gummy stem blight can be confused with anthracnose, which is caused by a fungal plant pathogen called Colletotrichum lagenarium [1]. To distinguish between anthracnose and gummy stem blight, gummy stem blight leaf lesions are darker, target-like and less deteriorated than anthracnose lesions [1]. Signs * Black specks (Perithecia and Pycnidia) on cankers * Round-ended, cylindrical, monoseptate and hyaline conidia [7]  Conidia dimensions: 6.4-13.6 Œºm in length and 3.69-4.68 Œºm in diameter [7] In vitro, the fungal growth on an agar plate looks rough and undulated [7]. When grown in vitro on agar, the fungus produces a white to olive-colored mycelium. In latter periods of growth, the mycelium is an olive to dark green or black color [7]. Disease Cycle Didymella bryoniae survives on deceased vines, crop debris and on seeds in between seasons and D. bryoniae can survive for 5 months on the soil surface in winter [2,6,8]. The fungus develops best under moist conditions and cotyledons and young watermelon/melon leaves are especially susceptible to the fungus [2]. D. bryoniae produces ascospores (meiotic spores) in perithecia and conidia (mitotic spores) in pycnidia and both of these spores are dispersed by rain/rain-splash and UV light is needed in order for the fungus to sporulate [3]. Ideal ascospore dispersal occurs after nightly rainfall and dew periods [2]. In order to infect, ascospores must land on leaves that have free- standing water on them[2]. Next the ascospores penetrate through the leaf cuticle [2]. Stems may be infected by D. bryoniae ascospores through stem wounds or by the extension of leaf lesions [2]. Fruits are penetrated through wounds and pollination flower scars [2]. Conidia are produced on the lesion sites of leaves and stems. Certain Cucurbita species are resistant to D. bryoniae but become vulnerable once they mature [2]. Epidemiology Didymella bryoniae is common in the Southern U.S. and other subtropical or tropical locations [2]. Most infections occur during rainy/wet seasons, in which the humid is greater than 90% and the temperature is roughly 20-24 ¬∞C [4]. Humidity seems to be a larger factor than temperature when it comes to infection success [2]. D. bryoniae can also be found in temperate regions, especially where winter squash and pumpkins are grown [2]. This pathogen is also common in greenhouses where cucumbers are grown [2]. In vitro, D. bryoniae does not form pycnidia without UV-light but if cultured in the presence of UV light and darkness, conidia/pycnidiospores produce mycelium rapidly [6]. Management & Detection The standard management practice for D. bryoniae is to use pesticide treated/pathogen-free seeds and to rotate crops on a 2-year cycle to reduce inoculum prevalence [2]. There are no commercially acceptable resistant cucumbers, melons or watermelons available yet on the market, but some plant breeders have identified D. bryoniae resistant genes, such as the gene db in watermelon [2,11]. Regular benzimidazole fungicide applications can control this pathogen, but certain D. bryoniae isolates have been found to be resistant to benzimidazole fungicides in greenhouse settings and in the field [2]. Along with fungicides, it is important to have proper ventilation and irrigation practices in greenhouse settings [2]. Proper irrigation and ventilation can be utilized to prevent water buildup on leaves [2]. Also to prevent disease onset in greenhouse settings, use UV-absorbing vinyl film, to prevent fungal sporulation [5]. Currently cultural practices and fungicides work well in greenhouses and in the field only if D. bryoniae is diagnosed in the early stages of disease development [8]. Molecular tools such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), PCR- enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and magnetic-capture hybridization multiplex real-time PCR are used to diagnose D. bryoniae in the early stages disease development, although these molecular tools may only be useful for specific isolates of D. bryoniae [8,9,10].

Hosts and Symptoms  The most susceptible host to Pyrenochaeta lycopersici is tomato, but the pathogen can also infect and cause damage to members of the families of Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae such as pepper, eggplant, cucumber and melon. Wilt, stunting and lack of vigor can be observed as the primary symptoms, and infected leaves can possibly show interveinal chlorosis that leads to premature defoliation. The distinctive characteristic of P. lycopersici is that it causes brown lesions on the surface of medium roots which are known as a brown root rot. In addition, the pathogen produces corky lesions on the large roots while rotting can be observed in the small roots. Once the infection progresses, these lesions become wrinkled and dark brown, making cracks that prevent hosts from acquiring nutrients and water. These results are often followed by the root failure which causes the reduction of tomato yield.  Disease Cycle  Most of the disease cycle for Pyrenochaeta lycopersici is not completely understood. P. lycopersici is an ascomycete that has not been observed to have a telomorph stage. It has been discovered that the pathogen is capable of producing pycnidia that produce conidia on conidiophores within the pycnidia. However, these pycnidia have never been observed on the infected plants in nature. P. lycopersici makes microsclerotia, which are survival structures, on the roots of host plants in soil. These microsclerotia can survive under harsh environments such as temperature changes and drought, and they can maintain the ability to infect other hosts in the soil for up to 15 years. Once the environment becomes favorable for the pathogen growth, germination will occur in microsclerotia that leads to the production of hyphae. The hyphae will penetrate and infect host roots through the epidermal cells. Approximately 48 hours after the primary infection, the infected cells begin to die, causing symptoms including necrosis. P. lycopersici keeps infecting neighboring cells until the roots are completely colonized, and corky root lesions can be observed upon its completion.  Environment  The suitable soil temperature for Pyrenochaeta lycopersici to initiate the infection is in the range between 15 and 20 ¬∞C. As the temperature increases above 18 ¬∞C, it is observed that there is less infection caused by the pathogen. The corky root rot became one of the most serious diseases of tomato because growers used the inoculated soil without any type of disease management. For instance, this occurred in Sweden when monoculture of tomatoes resulted in the yield reduction of 30-40%.

Schwartz, Howard F., Mohan, S. Krishna. 2016. Compendium of Onion and Garlic Diseases and Pests, Second Edition. The American Phytopathological Society, 8-86. https://doi.org/10.1094/9780890545003.002 This plant pathogen causes a disease in onion (Allium cepa) that is commonly called Pink Root. This fungus produces dark brown to black pycnidia that have setae with one to five septa and are 8-120 ¬µm long. Setae mostly occur around the ostiole, but may grow anywhere on the pycnidium. Pycnidiospores are hyaline, oblong - ovoid, biguttulate, and sessile in the pycnidium and ooze from ruptures or through the ostiole. The mycelium formed bythis fungus is septate, branching, and hyaline. If this fungus is grown on wheat straw or cellulose it produces a pink pigment that is a prominent characteristic of the disease this pathogen causes. This pathogen also produces several toxins. Host Range and Distribution Pyrenochaeta terrestris has been documented as a widespread saprophyte and a weak parasite to a lot of hosts. The biggest losses caused by this disease are usually from a disease complex including the species Fusarium, Pithium, Rhizoctonia and Helminthosporium. \\"In 1941 it was reported to survive on soybean, pea, cane, millet, oats, barley, wheat, corn, squash, cucumber, cantaloupe, muskmelon, tomato, pepper eggplant, cauliflower, carrot, spinach, and onion with reports of high disease to no disease damage\\".1\\\\. Fyre, J. (n.d.). Phoma terrestris E.M. Hans. https://projects.ncsu.edu/cals/course/pp728/Phoma/Phoma_terrestris.html This pathogen is adapted to many climates such as temperate, sub-temperate, and tropical; due to its ability to survive in a broad range of pH, temperatures, and soil types. Disease Cycle and Epidemiology This pathogen can survive as deep as 45 cm in the soil. It will survive in the soil as a type of spore, pycnidia, in plant roots, or plant debris of susceptible disease. Seed can not be infected. The root tips of onions are penetrated direclty by hyphae. Colonies of the fungus will grow on the root or a few centimeter away from the root tip. The fungus will extend thorught the root system, but the pathogen does not infect the basal stem plate or scales of the bulb. Ideal soil temperature for this pathogen and development of the disease is 24-28 degrees Celsius. Yield losses are greatest when plants are infected early in the season resulting in a poor root system that cannot keep up with water uptake during hot temperatures.1\\\\. Celetti, M. (2005). Pink root of onions. http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/hort/news/hortmatt/2005/21hrt05a5.html  Pink Root  Pink Root is a plant disease that is caused by the fungal pathogen Pyrenochaeta terrestris. = Symptoms = Roots will become infected and at first be light pink, sometimes they can be yellow or a yellow-brownish color. As the disease progresses the roots will become a darker pink then red and lastly turn to purple the advanced stages of this disease. Also in the later stages of this disease roots can become transparent, water soaked, and eventually disintegrate. New roots that form will also become infected, turn pink, and then die. Leaf size and number will be reduced, and bulbing will start early in infected plants compared to non-infected. Seedlings that become infected can be killed. Plants that survive from this disease become stunted and undersized which makes them not marketable. = Disease Management/Control = One of the best ways to control this disease is to use a crop rotation. It is suggested to rotate planting onion every 3‚Äì6 years with crops that are not susecptible to Pyrenochaeta terrestris. This will reduce but not completely eliminate the primary inoculum source. Planting cultivars of onion that are resistant to the Pyrenochaeta terrestris pathogen is a very effective management strategy that should be used in all commercial operations. Another method of management is soil solarization. This method has shown to be effective in areas like the San Joaquin Valley, where onions are planted in fall after a summer fallow period.1\\\\.

The rules of the game were published in Bulgarian by Swiss teachers in the Uchilishten pregled magazine in 1897, and football continued to gain popularity in the early 20th century. Among the founders of the Turkish team Galatasaray in 1905 was the Bulgarian Lyc√©e de Galatasaray student Blagoy Balakchiev, and the first Bulgarian club, Futbol Klub, was established in Sofia in 1909 on the initiative of Sava Kirov. Botev Plovdiv was founded in 1912, Slavia Sofia in 1913, and Levski Sofia in 1914. The Bulgaria national football team debuted on 21 May 1924 in a 1924 Summer Olympics qualifier, losing 0-6 to Austria in Vienna. What is today CSKA Sofia was established on 5 May 1948. In the 1950s and 1960s Bulgarian football achieved its biggest Olympic success, being third in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne and second in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, also finishing fifth in Euro 1968.

She was laid down on 29 March 1909 and was commissioned on 13 August 1910. C33 was involved in the U-Boat trap tactic. The tactic was to use a decoy trawler to tow a submarine. When a U-boat was sighted, the tow line and communication line was slipped and the submarine would attack the U-boat. The tactic was partly successful, but it was abandoned after the loss of two C class submarines. In both cases, all the crew were lost. C33 was one of the two C class submarines lost while employing this tactic. She was mined off Great Yarmouth while operating with the armed trawler Malta on 4 August 1915.

It is common in soil and has been isolated from soil collected around the world, in all continents. G. candidum is the causative agent of the human disease geotrichosis, the plant disease sour rot which infects citrus fruits, tomatoes, carrots, and other vegetables. It can affect harvested fruit of durians such as Durio graveolens. G. candidum is used widely in the production of certain dairy products including rind cheeses such as Camembert, Saint-Nectaire, Reblochon and others. The fungus can also be found in a Nordic yogurt-like product known as viili where it is responsible for the product's velvety texture. In a 2001 study, G. candidum was found to consume the polycarbonate found in CDs. However, this effect has not been reproduced. History =Taxonomy= The genus Geotrichum was described by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link in 1809 to accommodate the species G. candidum found on decaying leaves. Since then, over 130 taxa have been described in the genus, and hundreds of synonyms have been generated. For example, G. candidum was misclassified as the Oidium lactis in much early literature. Species of Geotrichum resemble the genera Trichosporon and Protendomycopsis; however, Geotrichum is of ascomycetous affiliation whereas the latter are members of the Basidiomycota. Species of Geotrichum are occasionally mistaken for fast growing members of the genus Dipodascus, which are characterized by irregularly branched, 10‚Äì14 Œºm wide hyphae and the production of single-spored asci. However, unlike Geotrichum, members of the genus Dipodascus lack dichotomous branching of the peripheral hyphae and their growth rates are generally less than 3 mm per day. =Phylogeny= Galactomyces candidus, formerly thought to be a distinct taxon, was found to be the sexual state of G. candidum using sequence-based methods Geotrichum candidum in the broad sense comprises 3 clades, corresponding to the species G. candidum, G. clavatum and G. fici, all of which are thought to have pathogenic potential. Species of Geotrichum can be differentiated by sequence analysis of the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (18S ribosomal RNA) or the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene. Morphology =Anamorph= G. candidum colonies are thin, spreading, soft, creamy and white in the anamorph state. The fungus G. candidum is characterized by hyphae that appear creeping, mostly submerged and septatee. The hyphae colour appears to be hyaline or lightly pigmented. When the hyphae becomes airborne it changes shape from arthroconidia to cylindrical or barrel-shaped or ellipsoidal. Chlamydospores are subglobose, solitary, borne on undifferentiated hyphae. Blastoconidia sometimes develop on hyphae laterally. Conidia appear arthrosporous, terminal or intercalary, aerial on an agar surface. The conidia size ranges from 4.8‚Äì12.5 Œºm x 2.4‚Äì2.5 Œºm. =Teleomorph= G. candidum is thought to be homothallic but most isolates are self-sterile. Sexual reproduction was first observed in strains isolated from soils in Puerto Rico. The fungus produces globose asci that contain a single, thick walled, uninucleated, globose to oval ascospore measuring 6‚Äì7 Œºm by 7‚Äì10 Œºm. The ascospores have a smooth inner wall and a furrowed outer wall. The septa are perforated by microspores, arranged in a ring structure. The colonies appear to be growing faster in the sexual stage than the asexual stage. Colonies grow at a rate of 5‚Äì7 mm daily at . Growth Geotrichum candidum forms a fast growing colony that can grow to 5‚Äì6 cm diameter at 5 days on Sabouraud-glucose agar, wort agar and synthetic media. Microscopically, the growth is characterized by the production of dichotomously branched hyphae that resemble tuning forks along the colony margin. The condial chains become aerial, erect or decumbent and measure 6‚Äì12(‚àí20) x 3‚Äì6(‚àí9) Œºm. The fungus can grow on a variety of citrus fruits and cause Sour Rot. It tends to cause rotting in fruits that are stored at . The conidia are colourless and have a slimy coating. G. candidum is also found occasionally in the human gut, feces, sputum and on skin. The fungus grows in soil, water, sewage, various plant substrates, baker's dough, husks of fermentation, bread, milk and milk products The optimal temperature for growth is with a pH range of 5.0‚Äì5.5. The temperature range changes depending on the surface that the fungus grows on. For example, in plants the optimum temperature ranges from . In animals the optimum temperature ranges from . The maximum temperature for growth is . Fungal growth can be supported by D-glucose, D-mannose, D-xylose, L-sorbose, D-fructose, D-galactose, sucrose, D-mannitol, SorbitolD-sorbital, ethanol and glycerol. Sporulation often requires a balance of carbon and nitrogen. Distribution G. candidum is extremely common in soil and has been isolated from substrates in Canada, United States, Britain, Germany, Austria, India, South Africa, Japan, Brazil and Peru. It is also found as a causal agent in sour rot in citrus fruits‚Äî a soft rot associated with the emission of a fruity odour. The fungus is also known as a post-harvest spoilage agent of muskmelon, squash and cucumber. It plays a role in tomato fruit rot when it is stored at . It is a naturally occurring colonist of certain dairy products particularly cheeses and is sometime used to inoculate wash-rind and bloomy rind cheeses. Commercial uses G. candidum can be used commercially to inoculate wash-rinds and bloomy rind cheeses. Cultures can be added to milk, brine or sprayed onto cheese surface. The optimum pH range for growth on cheese ranges from 4.4 to 6.7. The fungus colonizes nearly the entire surface of the cheese during the early stages of ripening. It is found on soft cheeses like Camembert cheese and semi-hard cheese Saint-Nectaire and Reblochon. For the Camembert cheese the fungi grows on the outside of the cheese forming a rind. The fungus is responsible for the uniform, white, velvety coat on Saint-Marcellin cheese. Lipases and proteases from G. candidum release fatty acids and peptides that provide the cheese with distinctive flavors. G. candidum reduces the bitterness in Camembert cheese through the activity of the aminopeptidases that hydrolyze low molecular weight hydrophobic peptides. Aminopeptidases also contributes an aroma in traditional Norman Camembert. The fungus also neutralizes the curd by catabolizing lactic acid produced by bacteria. G. candidum prepares the cheese for colonization of other acid sensitive bacteria such as Brevibacterium. The fungus inhibits growth of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. Commercial strains of G. candidum are available for cheese ripening.

Gameplay In Penetrator, the player flies a ship which can shoot forward and drop bombs. The first level is in open air, with just mountains to dodge, missiles which try to hit the ship, and animated radars. From the second level onward, the game is inside increasingly complex caverns, so the ceiling is also a danger, as well as new enemies. The missiles are now sometimes replaced with skulls that can move up and down, blocking the path. The levels flow seamlessly into each other, signified by screen colour changes. After four levels there is a short fifth level where a base needs to be destroyed by dropping a bomb precisely, and then there is a firework animation as a reward. After all levels are finished, the ship goes back through reversed levels. The ultimate level results in an seemingly impassible landscape, however due to a bug if you accelerate into it you can get through but the game crashes shortly after. There is an edit mode for designing levels and a training mode with infinite number of lives in which one can start from any level. Also, there is a simultaneous two-player mode.

The organization is sometimes referred to by other names that include some or all of the words: Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange. Initializing Electronic Data Interchange By: Hipaasuite It was established to provide leadership and guidance to the healthcare industry on how to use and leverage its collective knowledge, expertise and information resources to improve the quality, affordability and availability of healthcare, via forums, conferences and online resources, especially in matters of conformance to EDI standards required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA which was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996. WEDI has regional affiliates in 27 US States and the Virgin Islands.  History  In November 1991, the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) was established in response to the challenge from the Bush administration, specifically, Louis Sullivan MD, Secretary of HHS, to reduce administrative costs in the nation's health care system by up to 10%. Joseph Brophy, President of Travelers Insurance Company, and Bernard Tresnowski, President of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, agreed to establish and lead a voluntary, public-private task force, named WEDI, to develop an action plan to streamline health care administration by standardizing electronic communications across the health care and health insurance industry.  Initial task force  The initial task force included members from the following organizations: * The Travelers Insurance Company * Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association * Self-Insurance Institute of America * American Medical Association * ANSI ASC X12 * Mutual of Omaha * American Hospital Association * Drug Benefit Management * United Healthcare Group * American Clinical Laboratory Association * Columbia Healthcare Corporation * Medical Group Management * American Nurses Association * Aetna Life Insurance Company * American Dental Association * Health Insurance Association of America * National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare * Health Technology Management, Inc * National Association for Home Care * Health Care Financing Administration * American Association of Retired Persons * American Health Information Management Association * Blue Cross of California * American Health Care Association * Department of Income Maintenance State of Connecticut.  WEDI 1992 report highlights  In July 1992, WEDI published a report that outlined the steps necessary to make electronic data interchange (EDI) a routine business practice for the health care industry by 1996. The Workgroup envisioned the entire health care industry transacting business electronically, under a nationwide set of coding and format standards for all transactions. The transaction records would be transmitted electronically, in a secure manner to protect privacy, over private and public interconnecting networks like the internet and intranet. In the year following the publication of the WEDI report, the health care industry made substantial gains with EDI implementation: *ANSI ASC X12 approved the claim and eligibility standards for trial use *The Insurance Subcommittee of ANSI ASC X12 formed new workgroups to develop other standards required by the health care industry *HCFA initiated the use of Health Care Claim and Health Care Claim Payment/Advice standards and developed Efforts toward standardizing data content increased. EDI implementation guidelines for Medicare Part A Intermediaries and Part B Carriers consistent with the ANSI ASC X12 standards *The private sector began developing EDI implementation guides *EDI awareness and participation heightened as well as efforts to standardize data content  WEDI 1993 report highlights  WEDI reconvened in 1993 to resolve remaining implementation obstacles and to: *strengthen the understanding of and commitment to EDI among the health care industry, policymakers, and consumers by: developing a targeted plan for using industry resources to educate key audiences on EDI, encouraging participation in demonstration projects that prove EDI benefits and cost savings, and expanding membership to reflect more broadly the key constituencies affected by EDI *work for enactment of preemptive federal confidentiality protection for individually identifiable health care information in an electronic environment *develop a strategy to facilitate quick, industry-wide transition to EDI, including universal identifiers for patients, providers, and payors; health identification cards; coordination of benefits in electronic environments; and implementation guidance for data standards *work with appropriate parties to ensure the health care industry can meet WEDI's target of universal adherence to uniform data content by 1996 *provide additional data to the industry on the cost benefits of EDI, using WEDI demonstration projects as a primary source *monitor the industry's progress toward the use of data standards and EDI *provide basic telecommunications requirements and promote WEDI's goal of clearinghouse accreditation by 1994 *serve as a resource to work cooperatively with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and state governments to coordinate state and national efforts on administrative simplification.  WEDI financials identify $42 billion in potential savings  WEDI expanded its financial analysis to encompass eleven health care transactions. Newly available data were added to estimate the potential savings for providers and to update the estimated savings for payors and employers. Additionally, the cost of implementing EDI was added to achieve a more comprehensive picture of EDI's financial impact on the health care industry. WEDI's 1993 financial analyses concludes that combining the estimated implementation costs and the gross administrative savings potential, the cumulative net savings over the next six years (to the year 2000) is estimated to total over $42 billion. Although the estimated net savings may not translate directly to hard dollar savings for the nation's health care system, EDI savings will allow health care enterprises to reallocate resources from administrative activities to enhance quality, patient care, and customer service. To achieve this large cost savings, WEDI's eleven Technical Advisory Groups developed the following major recommendations. These recommendations are summarized below according to the Technical Advisory Group that developed the recommendation: *require specific and defined instructions through implementation guides to support uniform data content and coding structures (Standards Implementation and Uniform Data Content) *develop a network architecture to support a broad array of applications, communications, access methods, protocols, and line speeds (Network Architecture and Accreditation) *enact the model federal preemptive legislation drafted by WEDI to preserve confidentiality and privacy rights of individually identifiable health care information (Confidentiality and Legal Issues) *identify unique, standard identification numbers to promote industry standardization and uniformity of health care data (Unique Identifiers for the Health Care Industry) *develop and promote a comprehensive education and publicity work plan designed to provide standardized, economically affordable and geographically accessible education opportunities for all EDI constituents (Education and Publicity) *develop an ASC X12 standard for data content and format for health identification cards (Health Identification Cards) *continue demonstration projects that are ecumenical, identifiable to the public, demonstrate industry cooperation, leverage existing infrastructures, add something new, measure results, and meet aggressive time frames to demonstrate that technology is currently available to implement WEDI recommendations (Short-Term Strategies) *clearly delineate state and federal roles for EDI implementation (State/Federal Role) *provide ongoing analysis of the financial implications of EDI implementation (Financial Implications) *automate the Coordination of Benefits process (Coordination of Benefits) *use electronic environments and standardized data to improve fraud detection (Health Care Fraud Prevention and Detection).  HIPAA  The leadership and guidance provided by WEDI to the healthcare industry on how to use and leverage its collective knowledge, expertise and information resources to improve the quality, affordability and availability of healthcare, via forums, conferences and online resources, especially in matters of conformance to EDI standards required by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), now known as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) led to the development of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996. Leadership WEDI is currently led by Charles Stellar, the third CEO of the organization. Prior, Dr. Devin A. Jopp served as President & CEO from 2011 to 2015. Under Dr. Jopp's leadership, on the 20th anniversary of the original WEDI Report, an updated report entitled the \\"2013 WEDI Report\\" was released as a roadmap for the next generation of healthcare information exchange. Jim Schuping served as the organization's first CEO from 1996 to 2011.

They are believed to be one of the oldest breeds in Europe, probably derived from small black cattle brought to Ireland by Neolithic man. They were probably also the first cattle bred mainly for milk production, with other breeds being developed mainly for draught and meat. The climate of southwestern Ireland was suitable for milk production year-round, and the Celts also stored milk in the form of cheese and butter. Their coat is almost entirely black, with a little white on the udder. The horns are whitish with dark tips, but they are usually dehorned. Cows weigh about and produce of milk per lactation. The globules of fat are very small which makes the milk eminently suitable for the production of cheese, butter and yoghurt. The breed is probably descended from the Celtic Shorthorn, brought to Ireland as early as 2000 BC. They were developed as a milking breed suited to small subsistence farms of southern and western Ireland. They cause less damage to soils in high rainfall areas than larger breeds. By 1983 there were only around 200 pedigree Kerry cattle in the world, but numbers have since increased. A herd is maintained in the Irish state- owned estate of Farmleigh. Kerry cattle were imported to the United States in 1818 and prospered in the nineteenth century, but had become scarce by the 1930s. Today there are only a few herds in North America, mostly more recent imports to Canada.

Early life and education Isaac Norris was born in Philadelphia in 1701, the son of Isaac Norris, a prosperous Quaker merchant and original participant in William Penn's establishment of the colony of Pennsylvania and Mary Lloyd. Isaac was educated at the Friends' School in Philadelphia, and went abroad in 1722 and 1734-1735. Business After his schooling in London, Norris returned to manage the family business, Norris and Company, on behalf of his ailing father. After his father died in 1735, the junior Isaac became a senior partner. Marriage and family Well established after inheriting money and property from his father, in 1739 Norris married Sarah Logan, the eldest daughter of James Logan, also a prominent man in the city, and his wife. In 1742 they moved out of the city and resettled at the Norris family estate, \\"Fairhill\\" in what is now the Northern Liberties section of Philadelphia. Political career Engaged in business until 1743, Norris had acquired a large fortune, in addition to what he inherited from his father. He retired from business to devote himself to politics and public life. Politics Like his father before him, Norris entered into politics at an early age. He served as a councilman and alderman, a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly in 1734, and chairman of its most important committees. He was a Quaker of the strictest sect, and endeavored to keep the policy of Pennsylvania consistent with the principles of his religion. On the prospect of war with France and Spain in 1739, he opposed the organization of volunteer companies and preparation for the defense of the province. His followers, in opposition to the war party, were known as the \\"Norris party,\\" and his subsequent election to the assembly was the occasion of violent political struggles between the Quakers and other residents of the city. He was one of the commissioners to treat with the Albany Indians in 1745 and 1755, and he and his colleagues effected the purchase of several million acres comprising the southwestern part of Pennsylvania. In 1751, he was elected speaker of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly, and held that office fifteen years. In the first year of his administration, the statehouse bell was ordered from England. Norris proposed that its inscription should be: \\"Proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof,\\" based on the Bible's book of Leviticus, chapter 25, verse 10. During his speakership, the colonial representatives and the proprietaries had a long conflict about the taxation and legislative control of the Penn family estates. A leader of the Quakers, Norris joined the opponents of privilege. In a debate in the Assembly he declared, \\"No man shall ever stand on my grave and say, 'Curse him, here lies he who betrayed the liberties of his country!'\\" In 1754 he was selected as a member of the Pennsylvania delegation, led by Benjamin Franklin, that attended the Albany Congress, a gathering of numerous colonial representatives to plan an approach to their defenses before the pending French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War between Great Britain and France. Together with Benjamin Chew and Richard Peters), also of Philadelphia, he was on the committee that reviewed plans and chose Franklin's Albany Plan to propose to the full conference. In 1757, Norris was appointed with Benjamin Franklin as a commissioner to England to work for the removal of grievances related to the proprietary instructions, but declined on account of failing health. Although he opposed the encroachments of the Penns, he would not support the proposition to convert Pennsylvania into a royal province. He resigned his speakership when, in 1764, a petition to that effect passed the Assembly. Re-elected in the next election, Norris resigned again. Due to poor health, he retired shortly thereafter. He died at his estate \\"Fairhill\\". His death marked the passing of the Quakers' strong influence in Pennsylvania's politics, as more people of other backgrounds came to power. Scholar Norris was an excellent French, Latin, and Hebrew scholar, collected a valuable library, and was active in educational and benevolent enterprises. He served as a trustee of the College and Academy of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) from 1751 until his resignation in 1755. Daughter Norris's daughter was Mary Norris Dickinson, who married John Dickinson. References *Biographical sketch and portrait at the University of Pennsylvania *\\"Isaac Norris\\", by George W.

Geodesic spheres (structures of triangular components arranged to make a sphere) become stronger as they become bigger, due to how they distribute stress over their surfaces. As a sphere gets bigger, the volume it encloses grows much faster than the mass of the enclosing structure itself. Fuller suggested that the mass of a mile-wide geodesic sphere would be negligible compared to the mass of the air trapped within it. He suggested that if the air inside such a sphere were heated even by one degree higher than the ambient temperature of its surroundings, the sphere could become airborne. He calculated that such a balloon could lift a considerable mass, and hence that 'mini-cities' or airborne towns of thousands of people could be built in this way. A Cloud Nine could be tethered, or free-floating, or maneuverable so that it could migrate in response to climatic and environmental conditions, such as providing emergency shelters.

The series is set on a futuristic Earth and is centered on the exploits of the fictional paramilitary organization Celestial Being and its efforts to rid the world of war and conflict with a series of unique and extremely advanced mecha mobile suits known as \\"Gundams\\". It is directed by Seiji Mizushima and written by Y≈çsuke Kuroda, and features character designs by Yun K≈çga. The 25-episode season was officially announced by Sunrise during a 15-second trailer on June 2, 2007. The series aired on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and Tokyo Broadcasting System from October 5, 2007 to March 29, 2008. The second season began on October 5, 2008 and concluded on March 29, 2009. A movie sequel, titled Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer, premiered in Japan on September 18, 2010 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 25, 2010, in Japan. Mobile Suit Gundam 00 is the first Gundam television series to be animated in widescreen and in high-definition. Plot =Season 1= The series is set in 2307 AD. As a result of the depletion of fossil fuels, humanity had to search for a new source of power. The power was found in the form of multiple Dyson rings (massive arrays of solar power collectors) orbiting Earth, and supported by three orbital elevators, each one serving one of the three \\"power blocs\\" on the planet, namely the Union (Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations), controlling the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan; the Human Reform League (Sino-Japanese: ‰∫∫È°ûÈù©Êñ∞ÈÄ£Áõü; Romaji: jinrui kakushin renmei; Pinyin: r√©nl√®i g√©xƒ´n li√°nm√©ng), controlling nearly all of mainland Asia besides the Middle East along with most of Oceania; and the AEU (Advanced European Union), which controls mainland Europe as well as many islands in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. With this nearly inexhaustible source of energy benefiting only the major powers and their allies, constant warfare erupts around the globe among minor countries for fuels and energy. Countries that once economically relied on the sale of fossil fuels have plunged into poverty. Some even believe that solar energy threatened the \\"promised land of God\\", resulting in the 20-year Solar Wars. This chaos led to the formation of a private military organization, called , dedicated to eradicating war and uniting humanity through the use of four advanced machines called Gundams. Mobile Suit Gundam 00 follows four mobile suit pilots termed , sided with Celestial Being. The main protagonist is 16-year-old Setsuna F. Seiei, a taciturn Gundam pilot who grew up in the war- torn Republic of Krugis somewhere in the Middle East.Newtype Magazine, July 2007 Unable to counter Celestial Being's superior technology, the three major powers eventually unite into the United Nations Army in order to counter Celestial Being's armed interventions. In order to fight the Gundams, the United Nations Army employed the help of Laguna Harvey. Harvey, a Celestial Being intelligence agent turned traitor, provides them with 30 GN-X, mobile suits equipped with pseudo-GN Drives. As the United Nations resist Celestial Being's interventions, a second team of Gundams, known as Team Trinity, appears and assists in the Meisters' eradication of war, albeit in a much more cruel and cold-blooded fashion. Alejandro Corner, a former Celestial Being observer who plans to make use of the chaos and destruction created by Celestial Being to rule a reconstructed world, subsequently takes over Veda, Celestial Being's supercomputer which is believed to be located in the moon somewhere. Without the tactical aid from the organization's artificial intelligence, Celestial Being is easily overwhelmed and overpowered by the GN-X units and their superior numbers. The United Nations Army initiates Operation Fallen Angels to destroy the Gundams, having discovered the location of the Meisters' mothership, Ptolemaios. During the operation, Ali Al-Saachez kills Lockon Stratos after a climactic battle (Lockon Statos was just injured in a previous battle). Alejandro Corner, in his unique custom mobile armor Alvatore, attacks Setsuna as the GN-X units proceed to destroy the Ptolemaios and the remaining Gundams. Setsuna struggles with the monstrous Alvatore, but in the end succeeds in killing Alejandro. Graham Aker, an ace pilot of the United Nations Army, then challenges Setsuna to a fight, seeking revenge for his fallen comrades and questioning the purpose of the Gundams' existence. The fight results in the destruction of the GN-Flag, while the Exia is heavily damaged. =Season 2= Four years have passed since the final battle between Celestial Being and the UN Forces. Humanity, having established the Earth Sphere Federation, forms an autonomous peace-keeping force, the A-Laws, separate from and above the formal Federation army. Given unfettered discretion, the A-Laws is charged with the duty to further unify nations, enforce the will of mankind, and dispose of terrorist cells. Unknown to the general public, however, is that the A-Laws misuse their power and employ inhumane tactics to oppress freedoms, doctrines, and ideologies, all in the name of 'unity'. Meanwhile, Setsuna tries to confront the A-Laws by himself with his battered Gundam Exia, but is easily overpowered by their newer models. He is soon rescued by Tieria Erde, piloting his new mobile suit, the Seravee Gundam. By combining the GN Drives of Exia and 0 Gundam, Celestial Being's engineers manage to complete Aeolia's plans for an advanced mobile suit with twin GN drives ‚Äì the 00 Gundam ‚Äì which is entrusted to Setsuna. To pilot the two remaining new units, Lockon Stratos' twin brother is invited to assume his brother's codename and former position as the pilot of the Cherudim Gundam, and after Allelujah Haptism is rescued from the prison he was being detained in during the timeskip, he assumes the command of Arios Gundam. Saji Crossroad reclutantly joins Setsuna to pilot the upgraded 00 Raiser and confront his girlfriend Louise Halevy who has joined the A-Laws. Unknown to Celestial Being and the A-Laws, a third party is manipulating both sides of the conflict. This group call themselves \\"Innovators\\", composed of Alejandro Corner's former assistant Ribbons Almark, and his six subordinates. Subsequently, it is revealed that Aeolia Schenberg's plan is to ensure humanity's survival; unite the world's factions through Celestial Being's armed interventions and then advance humanity into deep space and undergo Innovation, a trans-human process. After uncovering the truth about Ribbons' true intentions, Celestial Being joins forces with dissident members of the A-Laws to stop their oppression and bring the fight to the Innovades. Being continuously exposed to the GN particles of the fully completed Gundam 00, Setsuna undergoes Innovation, becoming the first true Innovator with powers far greater than Ribbons and his group. The conflict ends in a final showdown between Ribbons and Setsuna with the latter emerging victorious. Following the final battle, the Federation disbands the A-Laws and works towards better global peace while Celestial Being returns into the shadows until another intervention is needed. The story continues in Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer. Production Character designs for Setsuna F. Seiei by Yun K≈çga =Development= According to Hiroomi Iketani, one of the Gundam 00 producers, planning for the series started in 2005, under the tentative name \\"Next\\". Iketani approached Seiji Mizushima, who had previously worked on the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime series, for the first time at the end of 2005 to be the director. Mizushima was initially reluctant about accepting the job due to his lack of knowledge regarding the Gundam franchise. The production staff, consisting of over 300 people, spent roughly two years planning the series. Compared to other anime shows, Gundam 00 has more main staff members, partly due to the detailed mobile suit designs. =Release= The series premiered on October 6, 2007, replacing Toward the Terra on the terrestrial MBS and TBS networks, occupying the networks' noted Saturday 6:00 p.m. timeslot. The first season ended its run on March 29, 2008. Season one of the series will be re-broadcast across Japan on various television networks such as TBS, Kids Station, MBS and BS-i from April onwards.

The final DVD of season one contains a whimsical trailer for the second season. Featuring voice work by the four Meisters, the trailer lampoons many early ideas for the show, fan theories and anime clich√©s before leading into a special message from Mizushima and a preview of the 00 Gundam. The Blu-ray disc collections have been confirmed, with the first and second volume released on August 22, 2008. A series of compilation movies with new animated sequences and re-recorded dialogue, titled Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Special Edition, was also released. The first volume was released in Japan on October 27, 2009 in the DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and UMD format.

A light novel series, Mobile Suit Gundam 00P was serialized in Dengeki Hobby and centers around the previous generation of Gundam Meisters. Like the anime, it was also divided into 2 seasons: First season is set 15 years before the anime series, while second season is set 10 years after season one. 00P features events that happened before the main story. It is penned by Tomohiro Chiba, with model conductions by Dengeki Hobby Magazine. The first volume of the sidestory was released in May 2008 by Dengeki Hobby. After the series ended, a sequel named Mobile Suit Gundam 00N was on serialization, taking place the same time as season one. A graphic novel that features variations of existing mobile suits, Mobile Suit Gundam 00V, which was serialized in Hobby Japan, is told in the format of a mobile suit development history book published 20 years after the anime series, featuring photo guides of customized models. It centers around the Mobile Suit observer Robert Spacey and his encounters with the different mobile weapons in the Gundam 00 universe. A sequel entitled Mobile Suit Gundam 00V Senki has replaced 00V after its serialization ended. 00V's timeline happens between the end of season one and beginning of season two, and 00V Senki's timeline is after the ending of season two. =Manga= Four TV broadcast-based manga series exist to date. One was serialized in Kerokero Ace and drawn by Kouzoh Ohmori. Minor changes are present compared to the anime, such as the use of more visually comedic facial expressions, and the omission of certain characters and subplots. The first volume to this version was released on March 26, 2008 by Kadokawa Comics. It has been released in English in North America by Bandai Entertainment, with the first volume released on September 23, 2009. The other manga adaptation series of the same name is also based on the television series, and is drawn by Auto Taguchi. Unlike the first manga series, this title is published by Kodansha. The two manga series essentially follow the same story as the anime's main plot, but vary in the sequence of events that unfold and in artistic style. A manga sidestory entitled Mobile Suit Gundam 00F was serialized in Gundam Ace. Illustrated by K≈çichi Tokita, this manga series focuses on Fereshte, an autonomous branch of Celestial Being that is also in possession of several previous generation Gundams. The series acts as a link for the main story to the 2 other sidestories and introduces the characters and mecha from the other publications. First volume to this title was released on March 26, 2008 by Kadokawa Comics. A sequel for 00F, called Mobile Suit Gundam 00I, was serialized in Gundam Ace after 00F. It is also illustrated by K≈çichi Tokita and takes place in the same time as season two. It mainly focuses on Innovades, and few characters from 00F has appeared. Another manga series based on the anime, Mobile Suit Gundam 00: Aoi Kioku, runs monthly on Kadokawa's Gundam Ace. This series focuses on the Gundam Meisters' memories and is illustrated by Tar≈ç Shiguma. A prelude to the film (drawn by Yun Kouga), \\"The place where the sky and earth meet\\", \\"Where Setsuna and Marina are... Two people tied together only by their spirits, divided by sky and earth,\\" was published in Newtype in July 2010. This was followed by a 50-page- long manga version of the movie by Kaishaku, published in Gundam Ace. in October 2010. This adaptation contained notable differences from the film, such as an alternate ending in which Setsuna uses his ELS powers to restore Marina's youth and marries her. =Film= A theatrical release was announced at the end of episode 25 of season 2, titled Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer A new character is revealed to be the first officially acknowledged true Innovator, whose name is revealed to be Descartes Shaman. A new enemy appears to be a newly discovered alien life form, Extraterrestrial Livingmetal Shapeshifter (ELS). The Japanese premiere was announced for September 18, 2010. The year is 2314 AD, two years after Celestial Being's last great battle and the world faces a new crisis. A derelict Jupiter exploration ship, abandoned 130 years ago, has left its orbit and is approaching Earth. The ESF has also begun to exploit the power of Innovators through Descartes Shaman. The world's exposure to GN Particles has resulted in many people awakening as True Innovators. Realizing the military benefits of such individuals, the Earth Sphere Federation has begun to research Innovation and exploit the emerging Innovators' abilities. Bandai Entertainment hosted the North American premiere of the film at New York Comic Con/New York Anime Festival. They later announced the license for the film. It was announced on September 13 that Singapore is going to be the first country to screen Gundam 00 movie with English subtitles on the same day as Japan, running from September 18 to September 29 in the Alliance Francaise Theatre The film was released on DVD & Blu-ray on December 25, 2010 in Japan. =Stage play= A stage play adaptation of the anime series titled premiered at the Nippon Seinenkan in Tokyo on February 15, 2019 and ran until February 18 before moving to the Morinomiya Piloti Hall in Osaka on February 23‚Äì24. The play starred Shohei Hashimoto as Setsuna F. Seiei, Y≈´ Imari as Lockon Stratos, Taiy≈ç Ayukawa as Allelujah Haptism, and Seiichir≈ç Nagata as Tieria Erde. Gundam 00 Re:Build will be released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 26, 2019. A stage play adaptation of the second season of the anime series, titled Mobile Suit Gundam 00 -Hakai ni Yoru Saisei- Re:(in)novation, will premiere at the New National Theatre in Tokyo from July 17, 2020 and will run until July 26. The cast members include, Shohei Hashimoto, Y≈´ Imari, Taiy≈ç Ayukawa, and Seiichir≈ç Nagata who all reprise their respective roles from the first adaptation. Yuki Maekawa as Saji Crossroad, Sakiho Motonishi as Louise Halevy, and Yuichi Nakamura as Mister Bushido. Kodai Miyagi replaces Yusuke Seto as Patrick Colasour. And many other returning cast members. =Video games= A 3D action game based on the anime entitled Mobile Suit Gundam 00, published by Namco Bandai Games and produced by BEC for the Nintendo DS, was released on March 27, 2008. This game follows the anime's plot with slight variations, but lacks the introduction of the GN-X, ending with the entrance and introduction of Team Trinity instead. A second video game, titled Mobile Suit Gundam 00: Gundam Meisters and developed by Yuke's for the PlayStation 2, was released on October 16, 2008 Capcom and published by Bandai (now known as Namco Bandai Games). Unlike the first Nintendo DS game, Mobile Suit Gundam 00: Gundam Meisters covers the first season's plot completely, albeit with slight deviations. The first season of Gundam 00 is also included in the game Another Century's Episode Portable and also in 2nd Super Robot Wars Z ~Hakai Hen~. The second season, however, was included in SD Gundam G Generation World. The film's storyline was adapted in Super Robot Wars UX and later Super Robot Wars V. Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3, published by Namco Bandai Games, also features Gundam 00 characters. =CDs= A drama CD prequel entitled Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Another Story: Mission-2306 was released on July 23, 2008. In this drama CD, Setsuna F Seiei is tasked with the mission of preventing an assassination of Barry Halevy, the leader of a fossil fuel export regulation watchdog group, and protecting his daughter, Louise Halevy from terrorist organizations. A second drama CD, Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Another Story: Road To 2307, has been announced and is currently slated for a September 24, 2008 release. This drama CD will focus on the Meisters, as well as the Union's story. Unlike the first prequel CD drama, the second will have a comparatively much more serious tone, with stories that link to the original TV series. A series of character CDs based around the concept of being a message to the character from the cast member who plays them will be released, starting from Setsuna's on August 13, 2008. Three original soundtracks and five singles, featuring the theme songs used throughout the first season, have also been released. Reception =Critical reception= After a sneak preview of Gundam 00 on September 1, 2007, Anime News Network remarked on \\"striking parallels\\" between the series and an earlier installment of the metaseries, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing (1995): \\"Like Gundam Wing, Gundam 00's main story begins with hyper-powerful Gundam units appearing at various locales to execute slightly-less-than-Dynasty- Warriors-level mayhem in synchronized phases of a paramilitary operation.\\" Later on October 21, 2007, Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network remarked that \\"its political flavour ... is distinctly post-9/11\\", noting the political and cultural similarities between the series and our modern society. Critics have praised the series for the smooth, detailed visual effects and animation. Following the end of the first season, Gundam 00 has received much critical acclaim. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network gave the first season a B+ rating, praising the second half of the season for its \\"unstoppable narrative momentum.\\" He stated that its \\"sheer momentum is breathtaking, and even as coldly detached as the series is, the catastrophic fates in store for its cast make for compelling viewing,\\" and concluded that \\"being swept up in the coalescing second half, the abrupt drop-off at the end only raises a raging thirst for season two.\\" Chris Beveridge of Mania.com gave the first season a B rating, stating that as \\"this part of the series comes to a close, events become bigger than they were before and nobody is safe from change ‚Äì or death.\\" He concludes that the \\"culmination of this season does give me all that I like from a Gundam series as it tries to change the world and then throws you for a loop by moving everything ahead four years.\\" Ross Liversidge of the UK Anime Network gave the first season a 9/10 score, concluding that it is \\"Everything Gundam should be ‚Äì huge cast, lots of politics and big battles. Fans should be pleased.\\" Mamoru Miyano, the voice actor for Setsuna F Seiei, won the \\"Best Voice Actor\\" award at the 2008 Tokyo International Anime Fair. Miyano and Tieria Erde's voice actor, Hiroshi Kamiya, both won the \\"Best Main\\" and \\"Best Supporting Male Characters\\" respectively at the 2008 Seiyu Awards. In the United Kingdom, Gundam 00 was nominated for the 2009 NEO Award for Best Anime. =Popularity= While critically acclaimed, the first season of Gundam 00 experienced lower average viewer ratings than its predecessors Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Over its 25-episode run, it averaged a television viewer rating of 4.85% and peaked at 6.1%. On a more positive note, Gundam 00's average rating was higher than the other previous Gundam shows set in alternative universes such as Gundam Wing (which averaged 4.3%) and G Gundam (which averaged 4.1%). The viewer ratings for the second season of Gundam 00 had improved, reaching ratings as high as 6.3%. The series was also a commercial success, with the DVDs showing consistently high sales figures. The third and seventh DVD release topped the anime DVD sales chart. In a top 20 anime poll published in the April 2008 issue of Newtype, Japanese readers voted for Gundam 00 as the best anime, higher than its predecessor Gundam SEED, which was voted ninth. In Newtype's poll for top 10 male anime characters, Setsuna F Seiei was voted second, Tieria Erde third, Lockon Stratos fifth, Graham Aker sixth, and Allelujah Haptism at seventh; and in its poll for top ten female anime characters, Nena Trinity was voted eighth and Marina Ismail was voted tenth. In the NHK's 2018 mega \\"All Gundam Poll\\", Mobile Suit Gundam 00 was place as the fourth best anime in the Gundam franchise, only behind the original 1979 Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. The NHK reported that there was a total of 1,740,280 votes in the poll. Future On April 14, 2018, the \\"Gundam 00 Festival 10 Re:vision\\" event in Tokyo announced that director Seiji Mizushima will be working on an anime sequel to Gundam 00.

Host and Symptoms  The primary host plant is a sunflower plant (Helianthus annuus L.) - a major oilseed crop. The plant has deep roots that prevent erosion linked damage, making for a highly adaptable crop. Helianthus is a large genus with 51 species, one of the largest plant families on Earth with a genome 3.5 billion letters long. Gene sequencing and current technological methods can be utilized to analyze the genome and potentially select for genes that may confer desirable traits such as disease resistance. To date, sunflower genotypes with partial resistance to P. macdonaldii have been described, but no fully resistant genotypes are available. Phoma black stem is one of the most common diseases affecting the sunflower plant in North America. Phoma Black stem has also been known to occur in regions of Europe and Asia. In many cases small lesions can be produced however if the infection is caused early on in the season the sunflower plant may become severely diseased. In the case of a more severe infection, smaller heads may be produced in which case there will be a reduced seed yield and oil percentage. = Symptoms = Many symptoms caused by the fungal pathogen can be observed post bloom or after flowering. The main identifying symptom is the production of black lesions along the stem which can be several centimeters in length. Lesions can also develop on the leaves, flower bracts, back of the head, and crown or base of stalk. Leaf wilting will also be noticeable. Small, fruiting bodies (pycnidia) are produced on the stem, these structures are spore bearing and can be observed with a magnifying or other hand lens. Phoma black stem can be distinguished from other diseases due to its black lesions and lack of lodging. The fungus also produces colonies that are gray-white in color and have a white mycelium that may resemble cotton.  Environment / Disease Cycle  Phoma black stem infections can occur throughout the growing season, although the lesions are more noticeable during late summer. Phoma macdonaldii penetrates into the plants either directly via enzymatic degradation of the plant cell wall or by mechanical pressure. The fungus overwinters in infected crop debris. Primary inoculum originates from overwintering fungal structures (perithecia, pycnidia, and mycelia). Conidia (from pycnidia) and ascospores (from perithecia) are released from fruiting structures and subsequently dispersed by rain and wind. Disease development is favorable in wet conditions during flowering stage and immediately after flowering stage. A third method of dispersal is through an insect vector, specifically, stem weevils. These insects feed on the leaves of the plant.  Management  A supremely effective control measure has not been identified. However, a 4-year rotation to other crops minimizes Phoma fungus in the soil. Late seeding to delay the regular time schedule to adult plant formation has proven successful in reducing disease severity. Nitrogen content in soil has been seen to affect pathogen ability to infect. The micro climate resulting from dense canopies, induced by high N fertilization, may have constituted a major climatic parameter in disease epidemiology and successful infection (within sunflower plants). A 2010 study attempted to identify the most crucial agronomic elements of the sunflower premature ripening disease induced by P. macdonaldii in south-western France. The combination of high nitrogen fertilization and heavy rain conditions resulted in high disease pressure every year. Additionally, differences in susceptibility of sunflower cultivars could be exploited as an additive research venue instead of sole focus developing fungicide protection. Cropping of resistant varieties in combination with appropriate nutrition and other cultural practices could reduce inoculum pressure and pre mature ripening. Promising cultivars should therefore be screened at high N supplies and under water-limited conditions, a procedure which could be used in resistance tests.  Importance  The resulting symptoms of Phoma black stem are again stunted plants with thin stems, smaller heads, blackened pith. Yield losses of 30% may occur in Europe and up to 70% losses have been reported in USA. In China, the first case was reported in Xinjiang in 2008 - it was believed to be introduced as a result of hybrid sunflower seeds being imported from abroad. The Chinese government included this fungus into its quarantine pathogen list in 2010. During 2010 and 2011 growing seasons, surveys were conducted in 37 commercial farms in five areas (Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Hebei, and Beijing). A total of 185 suspicious samples of sunflower black stem disease were collected and all were found from imported hybrid seed fields. The presence of P. macdonaldii was confirmed with pathogenic tests.  Pathogenesis  In regards to host - pathogen interactions: to date, no genotypes (of sunflower plant) have been identified to be completely resistant but some lines are more resistant than others. The inheritance of sunflower resistance to Phoma black stem was reported to be quantitative under additive and dominant effects. It has been recognized that significant differences in pathogenicity exist among different Phoma macdonaldii isolates on the same genetic material. In one study, part of the partial resistance in partially compatible interactions was shown to have a possible association with the expression of genes encoding PAL2 and a thaumatin-like protein, which showed significantly different expression levels between compatible and partially compatible interactions in both sunflower lines contaminated with Phoma macdonaldii isolates.

In both cases, cell voltage was about 2 volts. =Poggendorff cell= The cell was set up in a long-necked glass bottle with a zinc plate located between two carbon plates. The electrolyte and depolarizer were mixed. The mixture would dissolve the zinc plate even when the cell was not in use, so there was a mechanism for lifting the zinc plate out of the liquid and storing it in the neck of the bottle. =Fuller cell= The cell was set up in a glass, or glazed earthenware, pot. This contained the chromic acid solution, the carbon plate and a porous pot. Inside the porous pot was dilute sulfuric acid, the zinc rod, and a small quantity of mercury.

It was located on Foreshore Road, on the sea front of the South Bay. The theatre closed on 6 January 2014 after the operator's lease expired. The building was demolished by August 2018. The Futurist was built as a cinema in 1921. It remained in this role until 1958 when the stage was extended to allow live performances at the venue. The Beatles performed there twice, on 11 December 1963 and on 9 August 1964. Extensions to the stage allowed the popular The Black and White Minstrel Show to perform there many times when it was owned (between 1966 and 1974) by Robert Luff, the producer of the stage version. The extension to the stage meant the closure of the adjacent Arcadia Theatre which became a lounge. During the 1980s, Scarborough Borough Council took over the property and leased the theatre to Apollo Leisure Ltd (UK), who ran it until September 2002. In December 2002, Barrie C. Stead, who also runs the Hollywood Plaza cinema, took over the Futurist and refurbished the theatre and cinema, installing new projectors, DTS sound system and a new CinemaScope screen. Every summer, there was a summer season with usually the same acts every week in July and August. The Futurist had the twelfth largest capacity (2,155) of a theatre in the country, and the fifth largest outside London. In the winter of 2011, the Futurist managed to attract over 16,000 people during eight sell-out performances of Calendar Girls produced by David Pugh. On 9 January 2017, Scarborough Borough Council voted to demolish the theatre, by the narrowest of margins (22-21). The decision was a controversial one, as not all the councillors voted, and many locals and visitors alike, would have preferred the venue to be saved, restored and modernised. The fate of the site is uncertain. However, interest has been shown from the Flamingoland group, who gave a large donation to the incumbent conservative party prior to the ramping up of the parties campaign to demolish the building. Demolition of the building began in June 2018 and was completed in August 2018. Plans for a new Flamingo Land attraction on the site were revealed in February 2019.

The total area is 151.28 km¬≤ Saigawa Saigawa District is surrounded by mountains and the Imagawa and Haraigawa rivers flow through it. Fukuoka Prefectural Road 34 and the Heisei Chikuho railway run east and west through the district. The Shinto god Sai no Kami was enshrined at a crossing place along the Imagawa. The town takes 'Sai' from Sai no Kami and 'gawa' from 'kawa' or 'river'. =History= In 1905 East Saigawa Village, West Saigawa Village, and Minami Saigawa Village merged to form Saigawa Village. In 1943 Saigawa Village became Saigawa Town. In 1956 Irahara Village was annexed by Saigawa Town. In 2006 Saigawa merged with Katsuyama and Toyotsu to become Miyako. =Irahara= Irahara is located in Miyako town near Yukuhashi in Fukuoka. It is 253m above sea level, 33¬∞42'N, 130¬∞55'E.It is along Route 496 and about 40 minutes by car to the South from Yukuhashi. It is surrounded by nature. The area is 2356km2. The population of the area is 284. Irahara, Fukuoka Map History People began to live in Irahara during the J≈çmon period about 3000 years ago. Most of Irahara is underwater following the completion of the Irahara Dam in 2017. =Landmark Architecture= A historical building is the Naganuma House. It was built in 1839. It shows the way of life in the Edo era. Wildlife We can see wild animals. They are deer, boars, and rabbits. Kagura Irahara is famous for a traditional Noh dance called Kagura. It is offered for the gods of Shinto. The actions show the stories of Japanese myths. It has been passed down from parents to children for generations. Irahara, Fukuoka kagura Irahara Dam Miyako Town has been suffered from floods. A multi-purpose dam was built in Irahara in order to prevent floods and hold tap water. This dam is called Irahara Dam and construction was finished in 2017. =Harai River= Harai River flows through Irahara to Yukuhashi City. The length is 31 km. It is famous for fire flies in early summer and many people visit to enjoy swimming in the hot summer. Festivals Many festivals are held through the year. They are mainly concerned with agriculture. The festival called Jinkosai in May is the largest. At that time we enjoy kagura very much. Food The famous foods are hawasabi and rice. Hawasabi is very hot, and the rice is delicious. =Climate= In spring the mountains are full of fresh greens. In summer the river water is very clean, so people can swim there. In autumn the whole forest turns red. In winter there are very pure snow scenes. = Irahara Junior High School = Irahara Junior High's school buildings will be sunk under the Irahara Dam. So, Irahara Junior High School will be moved and re-built. The new building is designed by Mr Ando Tadao, an architect well known in the critical regionalism style. The plan is for the construction of a wooden building, with construction beginning in 2015.

Symptoms of fungal infection in plants include small, black, lesions on the leaves that develop into more widespread leaf rot, which then spreads to the stem and causes breakage. As part of its life cycle, the fungus produces sclerotia that persist in dead plant tissue and the soil. Management of the fungus may be effected by tilling the soil, reducing its nitrogen content, or by open field burning, all of which reduce the number of sclerotia, or by the application of a fungicide.  Hosts and symptoms  Magnaporthe salvinii (teleomorph), also known as Sclerotium oryzae (anamorph) and Nakataea sigmoidae (anamorph), is an ascomycete fungal pathogen that affects several rice and grass species, including: Echinochloa colona, jungle rice Oryza satvia, common rice Zizania aquatica, annual wild rice Zizaniopsis miliacea, giant cutgrass various turf grasses The first symptom that typically appears is a small, black, irregular lesion on the leaf sheath. Next, the lesion grows and penetrates the inner sheath until the leaf sheath becomes partially or totally rotted. The culm of the plant then shows black or brown discoloration and begins to shrivel. When the plant reaches maturity, the stem breaks due to the weakened, rotted stem. Sclerotia may be seen developing within the dead tissue of the rotted stem.  Disease cycle  Magnaporthe salvinii is an ascomycete fungus that infects a plant in a polycyclic manner, through conidia that are teardrop-shaped. Once a conidium lands on a leaf, it sticks to the leaf surface and generates a germ tube, appressorium, and penetration peg to bore through the cuticle of the plant. From there, the penetration peg forms a branched feeding structure analogous to haustoria formed in other fungi. As lesions form on the host plant, the pathogen continues to produce conidiophores and conidia that may be dispersed by rain splash to infect more plants. When conditions become unfavorable, the fungus overwinters in sclerotia inside the dead host plant tissue, or within the soil. The sclerotia can be dispersed through soil by rain and water irrigation. Moist, humid conditions, and high nitrogen fertilization are favorable conditions for the sclerotia, which germinate in wet areas of the leaf or sheath. Once the sclerotia germinate, the mycelium infects the plant through wounds or natural openings in the plant. Then the fungus produces conidia and repeats its life cycle.  Management  One form of control for this pathogen is tilling the field to reduce the number of sclerotia. Maximum tilling of the field significantly reduces the viability of the sclerotia in the soil compared to minimum and no tillage. Another useful method of eliminating sclerotia in soil is by open field burning; however, overuse of this method in some areas requires additional practical interventions. Other forms of management to reduce the number of sclerotia are swathing and fall incorporation with winter flooding. Additionally, restricting the amount of nitrogen fertilizer added to the soil will reduce germination of sclerotia, since they favor high nitrogen soil. Lastly, an important means of control of this fungal pathogen is the use of fungicide. Quadris is one specific commercial fungicide that is capable of killing Magnaporthe salvinii.

Archaeology and myth Croghan Hill is traditionally seen as a sacred place.\\"Burial place may date from early Christian age\\". The Irish Times, 11 December 1997. At the summit is an ancient burial mound, which has never been excavated but is believed to date from the Bronze Age or earlier. Seen from the sacred hill of Uisneach, the midwinter sun rises over Croghan Hill. In Irish mythology, Croghan Hill is called Br√≠ √âile or Cruach√°n Br√≠ √âile. √âile, which may come from a word meaning \\"prayer, praise\\", is said to be an Otherworldly woman or goddess who dwells within the mound. It was believed to be a portal to the Otherworld. The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn says that each Samhain the men of Ireland went to the hilltop to woo this beautiful maiden, and that each year someone would mysteriously be killed to mark the occasion, by persons unknown. An ancient bog body, Old Croghan Man, was found near the hill in 2003. He died sometime between 362 BC and 175 BC, and appears to have been a king or man of high-status who was ritually killed. On the eastern slope of the hill is an old graveyard and the remains of an early medieval church.Historic Environment Viewer. National Monuments Service. This church is named after Bishop Mac Caille, who is said to have been associated with Saint Patrick. The hill also has associations with Saint Brigid.

The village has been voted one of the tidiest town in County Offaly every year since 1978. Location The village is located at the junction of the R401 and R442 regional roads. The Figile River runs through the village under the R442 near its confluence with the Philipstown River. Between the village and Edenderry, 11 km to the north, lies the Bog of Allen. Clonbullogue is located near the point where three counties‚ÄîOffaly, Laois and Kildare meet. The village is on an island of pasture land in the bog of Allen. The area is marked on the Cottonian map 1653 of Leix & Offaly as Clanbolg. In the 1659 Census, Robert Shallcross was listed as the titled person in the area. In 1679, Charles II granted this area to the Purefoy family and for a time the village was called Purefoy's Place. In 1798, the village was burned‚Äîthe only part of Offaly to suffer this fate during the Rebellion. Two of the Wexford leaders, Colonel Anthony Perry and Father Mogue Kearns were captured here and were later hanged at Edenderry for their part in the 1798 Rebellion. In 1883, Father Comerford wrote: \\"The village of Clonbullogue which is situated on the Little Barrow presents a decayed and ruinous appearance, some of the larger houses having been burned during the rebellion of 1798\\". Population As of the 2016 census, the population of the village was 436. The village population expanded in the 1950s to accommodate the workers employed to develop the area's bogs as an energy resource under the guidance of the Irish state company Bord na M√≥na. The village population suffered severe declines from famine, poverty and emigration from the mid-1840s. In 1861 the population of the village was 110, and by 1871 had fallen to 79.  Heritage  Antiquities in the area include the Clonkeen stone. This is said to be 340 million years old and legend has it that the stone was thrown from Croghan Hill by Fionn MacCumhaill. Other sites includes the remains of a togher at Ballykilleen, the ruins of Cloncrane Church, a ring-barrow at Shean and a sheela-na-gig from Ballynowlart and Clonsast. The last was an important religious site in early monastic Ireland.  Clonbullogue airfield  Irish Parachute Club at Clonbullogue airfield Clonbullogue airfield is owned and operated by the Irish Parachute Club who are based at the field. The airfield has one east-west grass strip runway which is 770m long and 18m wide. There are six aircraft based on the field, most of them owned by the Irish Parachute Club. The airfield is located about west of Clonbullogue village and lies under a restricted airspace designated EI-R16. On 13 May 2018 a plane from this airfield carrying 16 parachutists crashed, killing the pilot and a seven year old boy. Sport Clonbullogue soccer club known as Saint Patricks won the Division 2 league in 2004. GAA club won the junior championship in the 1980s and played intermediate until 2013 when they were relegated to junior again. They won the junior A championship again in 2015 promoting them to intermediate once again.  People  With the conquest of Ireland from the Cromwellian wars onwards, Clonbullogue was extensively planted by colonialists. Quaker families were common under the plantations. Present day local family names can reflect these plantations. In 1731, Rev. Boyle Travers, Protestant Rector of Rathangan and Clonmore (which includes part of this area) notes; \\"I bless God for the comforting assurance I have that there is no reputed friary, nunnery, friars, nuns or Popish schools\\". *Eamon Broy, former Garda Commissioner, was born near Clonbullogue in 1887 and is buried in a nearby cemetery. *Jasper Robert Joly 1819‚Äì1892, was born at Clonsast.

Life cycle  The pathogen is an obligate biotroph meaning that each stage of its cycle is dependent on having a living host. The direction between reproducing sexually or asexually is dependent on the availability of a host. Sexually, the life cycle starts when basidiospores land on flax leaves and form pycnium during December and through January. Aecium are then formed from the pycnium after being fertilized with a pycniospore that is of a different mating type. Urediniospores and aeciospores then form pustules on the leaves that release more spores leading to further infection on neighboring leaves. Teliospores are then formed on the plants stem and undergo meiosis. Afterward, the teliospores shed haploid basidiospores repeating the cycle. Asexually, the pathogen cycles between forming pustules and infecting surrounding leaves and plants. The pathogen is autoecious, meaning it completes its life cycle on a single plant. This is done purely through mitosis and produces genetically identical cells within the pustules.  Hosts  The pathogen prefers an environment in the temperate plains or hills of the United Kingdom rather than in high altitude and cold conditions. Due to this, there is a higher prevalence of resistance seen in hosts in these more favorable environment compared to hosts seen in mountainous ranges. This is primarily due to the fact that there is a higher evolutionary pressure placed on these plants. Those that can defend against the pathogen go on to reproduce and pass on the genes responsible for their immunity. * Flax * Linseed * Wheat  Symptoms and signs  Signs and symptoms of flax rust include: = Signs = * Light yellow to orange-yellow sori * Reddish-yellow to orange uredinia on leaves * Brown to black telia All signs are uniform for the hosts of the pathogen stated before. The only difference is the amount of signs seen due to the varying leaf shapes of the plants. = Symptoms = * Yellowing of leaves * Necrotic leaf spots Symptoms are uniform for the hosts of the stated above. There is some variation in the amount of symptoms seen because of the amount of available host area infected by the pathogen.  Research  The pathogen itself is not known for being detrimental to farmers since it does not take away from the total yield. During the 1990s, the pathogen was used as a role model for the molecular basis of plant immunity. The majority of research worked on observing the pathogenicity of a variety of physiological races of the pathogen and the resistance and susceptibility of the \\"gene-for-gene\\" relationship and understanding the breakdown of resistance when using a single gene. This led to the use of incorporating multiple resistance genes to ensure resistance persisted. From the late 1980s to present, the focus of research shifted to more specific molecular studies. One major discovery included the cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins. These proteins help provide resistance against fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, insects, and parasitic plants. This was found through observing point mutations, re- assortment of mutation, and duplication and deletion of LRR units done by intragenic recombination in Australia in 2007.

Retrieved on 9 September 2007. Life cycle Symptoms usually are contained to a single year on conifers, shedding the affected needles in fall. To survive the winter Melampsora medusae remain as teliospores on the dead leaves of the host, coming back in the spring to be spread by the wind as basidiospores, and infecting new conifers. After about two weeks, aeciospores are produced on the coniferous needles. Those spores serve as inoculum for an infection in live trembling aspen and other poplar trees in another two weeks. Urediniospores are produced on the poplar leaves, where the infection spreads. Winter then comes, and the cycle begins again. References Bibliography * Brown, J.S.

Biography Zass was born in 1888 in Vilnius, then part of the Russian Empire. While a young man, Zass' strength training included \\"bending green branches\\". During First World War, Zass served in the Russian army, fighting against the Austrians. He was taken as a prisoner of war four times, but managed to escape each time. As a prisoner, he pushed and pulled his cell bars as part of strength training, which was cited as an example of the effectiveness of isometrics. At least one of his escapes involved him 'breaking chains and bending bars'. He went on to promote the use of isometric exercises. Following the war, Zass joined a circus to perform feats of strength, touring internationally. It has been claimed that Zass was a spy and secret agent working for Russian military intelligence, using his circus travelling as cover. In 1926, his autobiography, The Amazing Samson: as Told by Himself, was published. His first wife, Blanche, died in 1928 while still a teenager. He was still performing as a strongman in the 1930s. From the 1950s until his death, Zass lived in Hockley, Essex, staying in a bungalow along with other former circus acts. He died in 1962; after a dawn funeral, he was buried in the parish church of St Peter & St Paul in Hockley, England. He was honoured with a statue in a museum in Orenburg, Russia. Strength feats Zass has been credited with various feats of strength: *Carrying his injured horse in wartime *Carrying on his shoulders two lions as part of his circus act *Carrying on his shoulders simultaneously a grand piano, a pianist and a dancer. *Catching a woman fired from a cannon *Suspending a piano from his teeth *Bending with his bare hands an iron bar 5 inches long and 0.625 inches square into a U-shape *Being able to \\"pound a 5-inch spike through a 2 inch thick plank using only the palm of his bare hand\\" References External links * Gallery of strength feats by Alexander Zass * Alexander Zass (The Amazing Samson) 1888 - 1962 Category:1888 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Burials in Essex Category:Circus strongmen Category:People associated with physical culture Category:People from Rochford District Category:People from Vilnius Category:Russian male professional wrestlers Category:Strength training writers ","title":"Alexander Zass"},{"id":"11553131","text":"Belianska Cave (, ) is a stalactite cave in the Slovak part of the Tatra mountains, the largest and the only one open to the public in the Tatras.

This was in a period of segregated public schools in South Carolina.  History  The Seneca Institute was a Christian, primary and secondary school for African Americans that was founded in 1899 by the Seneca River Baptist Association. It occupied about 8 acres (3.2 ha) in Seneca, South Carolina. The site is bounded by West South Third and South Poplar Streets and Scotland Road. It was founded to promote education for African-American children at a time in which there was no secondary school for African Americans in Oconee County. The first president of the Seneca Institute was Rev. Dr. John Jacob Starks. He was born in what is now rural Greenwood County. He served the Seneca Institute for thirteen years. He left to become the president of Morris College in Sumter, South Carolina. After serving as its president from 1912 to 1930, he became the president of Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina. He served as its president until his death. Seneca Institute - Seneca Junior College library With the addition of two years of college instruction in 1926, the Seneca Institute was renamed the Seneca Junior College. In addition to the primary and secondary classes, it served as a junior college and teaching training course. The school struggled during the Great Depression. It was closed in 1939. The Seneca Institute had students who lived in the community and boarders. It had a brick dormitory for girls, the B.S. Sharp Dormitory for boys, the A.P. Dunbar Hall for classes, and a library. Except for the log cabin library that is still standing, the buildings were razed in 1963.Ellen Naomi Childers and Willie Cosdena Gideon Gunn, A journey of faith : 40 years of excellence : a history of Seneca Institute  Seneca Junior College, 1899  1939, Seneca, South Carolina, 2003, pp. 19-32.Louise Matheson Bell, Seneca: Visions of Yesterday, 2003, pp. 74-75., .  Other African-American schools  During the period of segregated education, there were other private and public schools in Oconee County. The Norrel School was found by Northern Presbyterians. It began as a church and school on Fairplay Street in front of Mt. View Cemetery. The school closed prior to 1939. The Oconee County Training School, which was a teaching training school for African Americans, was a public institution founded in 1925. Its programs included home economics, industrial arts, and agriculture. In 1955, its building was used for East End Elementary School. Blue Ridge High School was built in 1955 to serve the African-American community. It continued as the African-American high school in the Seneca area until 1969 when the county public schools were integrated. The building was renamed Seneca Junior High School and later Code Elementary School.Ellen Naomi Childers and Willie Cosdena Gideon Gunn, A journey of faith : 40 years of excellence : a history of Seneca Institute  Seneca Junior College, 1899  1939, Seneca, South Carolina, 2003, pp. 93-94.  Legacy  Seneca Institute - Family Life Center The Seneca Institute ‚Äì Seneca Junior College educated many African Americans that continued to live in the Seneca area as well as the nation. This included many physicians, dentists, clergymen, and educators. In 1978, the Seneca River Improvement Association dedicated the Seneca Institute Family Life Center, a multi-purpose building, as a community center.

The Verossa exceeded Japanese government dimension regulations concerning external dimensions and engine displacement, offering buyers a sedan that continued to offer a rear-wheel drive platform, opposite the 2001‚Äì2006 Camry with very similar dimensions and front-wheel drive platform. The advantage the Verossa offered over the Camry was the ability to offer four-wheel drive, which the Camry couldn't do. The Verossa, introduced in June 2001, was launched with the Toyopet Store alternative called the Progr√®s and the Toyota Store Brevis. Toyota replaced the aging Mark II stablemates, the Chaser and Cresta which ended production together in 2000 with the Verossa, combining the sporting aspects of the Chaser with the luxury characteristics of the Cresta, in a vehicle that is smaller than the Crown. The Verossa was a larger version of the Altezza that debuted in 1998 and became a sales success, offering high performance and luxury with an inline-six engine and rear-wheel drive. The Verossa shared its \\"X\\"-chassis model code with its predecessors and also featured the rear-wheel drive layout. The Verossa's production ceased in April 2004 due to poor sales.

Four-wheel drive was offered on some trim levels, but only available with an automatic transmission. Standard equipment and options throughout the Verossa's range included a front stabilizer bar, navigation, power seats and fully automatic air conditioning. The different engine sizes were offered to allow Japanese buyers which annual road tax they were willing to pay; the larger engines did offer higher levels of standard equipment and luxury features. = 20, 20Four and 20Four G Package = The entry-level Verossa came equipped with Toyota's 1G-FE engine producing at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm.

The Council of the Church is sometimes confused with the Common Council of the Church.See, e.g., Bruce R. McConkie, 1966. Mormon Doctrine, 2d ed. Salt Lake City:Bookcraft, p. 150 where the description of the Council of the Church is given the title Common Council of the Church. Origin The council was first spoken of in a revelation that was given to Joseph Smith on March 28, 1835: > [T]he most important business of the church, and the most difficult cases of > the church, inasmuch as there is not satisfaction upon the decision of the > bishop or judges, it shall be handed over and carried up unto the council of > the church, before the Presidency of the High Priesthood. And the Presidency > of the High Priesthood shall have power to call other high priests, even > twelve, to assist as counselors; and thus the Presidency of the High > Priesthood and its counselors shall have power to decide upon testimony > according to the laws of the church. ... [T]his is the highest council of > the church of God, and a final decision upon controversies in spiritual > matters. There is not any person belonging to the church who is exempt from > this council of the church.Doctrine and Covenants 107:78‚Äì81. History When the council has been convened, it has usually been composed of the First Presidency of the church and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. However, the council has been convened with non-general authority high priests serving as the twelve counselors at least once.See John Taylor, G. Homer Durham (ed.), 1943. The Gospel Kingdom: Selections from the Writings and Discourses of John Taylor, Third President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Bookcraft: Salt Lake City, p. 201‚Äì202. The council in the church today The Council of the Church has not been formally convened in the church for many years. For this reason, few Latter-day Saints have heard of the council or are familiar with its potential powers. However, in the church today, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles hold weekly combined meetings in the Salt Lake Temple. This meeting acts in the church as the de facto highest governing council. Thus, the joint meetings of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles may be said to be the de facto, if not the de jure, Council of the Church.

Geography  Lev√©l is in the north-west of Hungary, close to the M1 motorway between Mosonmagyar√≥v√°r and Hegyeshalom. It is on the international bicycle road to Hegyeshalom and Rajka.  History  The village was first mentioned as Kalthostan in a German text of 1410. The Hungarian name first appears in a tax registration in 1532. The Turkish local governor depopulated the village in 1529. In 1570 Maximilian II deported the W√ºrttemberg Saxons to the area. The French occupation of 1809 resulted in economic hardship for the population. The village gained access to electricity in 1926. In the Second World War the village's agricultural produce and livestock was requisitioned by the Wehrmacht, leading to food shortages. Most of German population was deported after the war. During the Communist era, the area saw economic growth brought on by state investment.  Demographics  The population of the area is gradually increasing. Statistically, 50-60% of the population require income support. Only 6% of the population have completed higher education. 49% of the population work in industry, 6.5% in agriculture and 15% in commerce. Much of the population works in Mosonmagyar√≥v√°r.  Infrastructure  The infrastructure of the village is seen as generally good. A water conduit system was constructed in 1997. 98% of the population have telephone lines, and cable television is common.

As the title suggests, A Century of Song is a chronological overview of songs from the 20th century. Recorded from 1999 to 2003, the songs were originally available for download from their website Eschewing the canonical choices that would define such a chronology, LMP recorded songs ranging from the Tin Pan Alley of the turn of the century, to rap, alternative rock and dance music at the century. As such, A Century of Songs covers a multitude of genres, including plunderphonics, krautrock, happy hardcore and country. Reviews were generally positive, but some expressed bafflement at the selection of songs and the disparate styles used. The songs were eventually collected in a six CD-R disc box set, limited to 100 editions worldwide. Reviews were generally positive, but some expressed bafflement at the selection of songs and the disparate styles used.  Recording  With the release of their EP Aunt Canada in 1996, LMP had attempted to expand their sound. Band members Ryan Bassler and Eric Haugen felt that, far from making their own Pet Sounds, they compromised their perfectionism with budgetary concerns, technical and personal limitation. Coupled with interpersonal conflicts and a simultaneous non-existent and hostile reception in their native Champaign, Illinois, LMP settled in Evanston, a suburb north of Chicago, in 1999. The move also parsed what was a 22 person pop orchestra to core members Bassler and Haugen. In their new recording space, which they called \\"Eckhouse 2000\\", they decided to shelve current projects for a new project. In a 2005 interview with Italian web magazine Indipop.it, Haugen said that A Century of Song was the band's attempt at \\"to explore a lot of different avenues of pop music and ultimately discover our own sound.\\" This was inspired from his and Bessler's interest in constructing personas, which they refer to as \\"fake authenticity\\", alongside new band names, recording locations, and imaginary personnel.\\" Haugen lists song poem producer Rodd Keith as an inspiration to the project as the breadth, alongside with limited time, meant that \\"the aim was simply to make a finished recording as quickly as possible, and then move on to the next.\\" Originally planned for a six week recording schedule, it ended up taking 18 months. Starting in 1999, LMP posted their progress as MP3s on their official website. After uploading the final song in 2001, they moved to other projects, which included EPs The New Body Language and Meeting Up and Making Friends, and their debut album Love Conquers Alda. Because of fan demand however , LMP decided to release the sessions as a box set.  Composition  As a chronology of music in the 20th century, LMP selected several songs that exemplified the time period. Songs such as \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\" and \\"She May Call You Up Tonight\\" were covered in a straightforward fashion, which critic Douglas Wolk calls it covers \\"done in the style of... LMP themselves.\\" However, the bulk of the album is made up of radical departures from their original forms, with songs of one genre transposed to another. \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" is composed as a sound collage, inspired by John Oswald, cutting in snippets of songs to form the lyrics. Hits of '69\\" is a stylistic cover of the Stars on 45, as a pastiche of the form and as a medley of songs of that year. An exception is \\"C' Howard's Gum Has the Power of Taste, an original song in the style of radio commercials of the fifties.  Release  When recording on A Century of Song ended in 2002, LMP planned on releasing the set in December of that year. Because of production delays, LMP decided to postpone the release to another date. By November of 2003, the box set was still delayed, but by March 2004, it was moved to April 20 of that year. The reason given was a break from recording and moving to another studio space in Chicago. Eventually A Century of Song was finally released to online orders in November 2004. Each box set came with six CD-Rs; discs one through five contained the original project, and the sixth bonus materials, including outtakes, remixes, and other unreleased materials. They came with 132 pages of liner notes, both enclosed in hand-made plastic boxes.  Reception  Critical reception of A Century of Song was positive, applauding LMP for their inventive covers of pop songs. Michaelangelo Matos of The Village Voice said that what LMP \\"lack in suavity and flair they make up for with sheer doggedness and idea mongering.\\" Douglas Wolk of Seattle Weekly had the same sentiment that, despite the lack of polish, \\"it sounds like everyone's having a great time.\\"Much of the negative criticism was levied at the nature of the box set's release, with Greg Adams of Allmusic stating that it was disappointing \\"that more people won't hear it.\\"  Track listing   References  Category:2004 albums Category:Covers albums ","title":"A Century of Song"},{"id":"11553347","text":"L√∂v≈ë is a village in Gy≈ër-Moson-Sopron county, Hungary.

History The interior of P√∂ide church.The current P√∂ide Church building is believed to be constructed on the remains of an earlier chapel dating from the 13th century. After the conquest of Saaremaa in 1227, the eastern part of the island belonged to the Livonian Order, who built a fortress at P√∂ide as their headquarters during the second half of the 13th century. This fortress was destroyed by the Saaremaa natives during the wave of uprisings against the occupying forces that took place in Estonia and Saaremaa during the St.George's Night Uprising of 1343. There was a chapel on the southern side of the fortress, and the walls of this chapel today form the central part of P√∂ide church. Owing to its massive form, it is colloquially named the fortress-church. The building was looted and burnt during World War II and also used as a storage facility.

P√∂ide church has been renovated and reconstructed gradually since 1989. The chancel, stone altar, and vestry have been renovated. The main part of the building (including the nave, roof, and spire) still awaits renovation. Several big tombstones inside the church are displayed behind glass, showing the importance of the church as a cultural centre for nearby communities during previous centuries. These include the tombstone of a headless knight, Heinrich von Schulmann, a nobleman from nearby Tumala estate, who was executed in 1613 (during the Danish reign) in Copenhagen for being politically connected with the Swedish authorities. Congregation Today, a small Lutheran congregation is active, with about 30 members. In the summer, church services are held twice a month in the church building. During the winter, the services are held in nearby pastorate. On 28 July 2006 the first Roman Catholic wedding was held in P√∂ide church since the Reformation era.

New calls WMAX-FM were granted on March 5, 1992, and the station signed on shortly thereafter from studios at 412 State Street in Rochester and a transmitter atop the Seneca Towers apartment building on Seth Green Drive in Rochester. WMAX-FM was the first adult album alternative station in the market, quickly developing a cult following despite limited signal reach in the outlying suburbs. In 1996, Auburn Cablevision purchased WLKA (102.3) in Canandaigua, New York, converting the station to a simulcast of WMAX-FM as \\"106.7 and 102.3 the Max\\" and extending the format's reach into the southeastern Rochester suburbs and northern Finger Lakes region.

They were responsible for some of England‚Äôs most important silversmithing of the time. The family was active in the production of silver plate in London for about a hundred years. Nicolas Harache The revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1598) in October 1685 by Louis XIV, the grandson of Henry IV, drove an exodus of Protestants out of France, and increased the hostility of Protestant nations bordering France. The Harache family immigrated to London, England because of this protestant persecution. It appears that the first member of the Harache family to make the journey to London as a result of persecution, was Nicolas. He came with his wife, Marie Mascrier, and their daughter Marie, sometime between August 1667 and November 1668. Their son, Thomas, was born in London in 1668 and his name appears in the baptismal list for Threadneedle Street church dated 29 November.Huguenot Society Quarto Series, 13, p.189 So far, no records have been discovered, either in Rouen or in London, that prove Nicolas was a master goldsmith. There is no record of his work or where he and his family lived, although the church where his son was baptized indicates that he had taken up residence in the general area that was later occupied by the members of the family who followed him to England. There appear to be no burial records of Nicolas but it must be assumed that he died in late 1676 or early 1677, because in the latter year, Marie returned to Rouen, where she remarried on 28 October 1677.Societe du Protestantisme Fran√ßais Her new husband was Jean Lefebvre, who does not appear to be directly related to the Lefebvre family, some of whose members later were apprenticed to Peter Harache. Eleven years later, in 1688, Marie made the return trip to London, bringing her husband and family with her. The records of Threadneedle Street church show that on 20 May 1688 ‚ÄòMarie Masserier, wife of Jean Lef√©vre of Rouen, Thomas Harache of Rouen, and Marie Harache of Rouen,‚Äô all ‚Äòpresented themselves to make reconnaissance‚Äô at ‚ÄòThe French church of London‚Äô. Madeleinne and Pierre Harache Next to arrive was Madeleinne Harache, who was married to a Parisian goldsmith named Edouard Hobbema. They arrived in 1675.Huguenot Society Quarto Series, 58, p.265 The most famous member of the family was Madeleinne‚Äôs brother, Pierre Harache (the elder). He was born in Rouen, in 1639, and was baptized at Quevilly, the principal Huguenot church of the city, on September 25.Societe du Parler Fran√ßais Pierre arrived in England in October 1681National Archives, T11/8, p.11 and appears together with his wife Anne in the denization list dated 26 June 1682. He was made free of the Goldsmiths‚Äô Company Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths on 21 July 1682 and took Simon Pantin as his apprentice in 1686. Although a Sterling mark has been attributed to him dating from his freedom, the only certain mark recorded for him was entered at Goldsmiths‚Äô Hall as a largeworker (producing candlesticks and hollowware) in 1697, when he gave his address as ‚ÄòSuffolk Street near Chairing (sic) Cross‚Äô.Mark Book Goldsmiths' Hall, London He remained there until his death in 1712. Although there is no record showing that Pierre Harache (the elder) was ever in receipt of Royal Bounty, it is not clear whether he continued to fulfill commissions until his death. However, at least one piece has been identified bearing his mark and dated 1705. Pierre Harache‚Äôs work is of the highest standard in both design and execution. He used cut card work and applied decoration as well as engraving much of which has been attributed to Blaise Gentot (1658‚Äì1700). He enjoyed the patronage of the greatest clients of the day and was rivaled only by his fellow, Huguenot David Willaume. Anne Harache Although not common, it was not unknown for women in the Harache family to be practising goldsmiths in their own right; Heal‚Äôs reference to ‚ÄúMrs. Harache, silversmith, corner of Great Suffolk Street, 1699‚Äù may well have been correct, since Pierre‚Äôs wife, Anne, appears in the denization list of 1682, giving her the right to trade in her own name. This would explain the reference to Madame Anne Harache supplying a Monsieur Grandmaison with a pair of silver candlesticks in Paris in 1668 (Archives Nationales Z1B 517) and a similar reference to Mrs. Ann Harache supplying a silver plate weighing 172 oz to the Duke of Somerset in 1690. Mr Bridgman's Accomplice, John Dann, 2019, , refers to Anne Harache's connection to Goldsmith Bankers at the time Jean Harache The next member of the family to come to London was Jean Harache, who was born in 1655 and baptized at Quevilly on 30 May (Societe du Parler Fran√ßais). He was in England by 16 December 1687 (Huguenot Society Quarto Series, 18, p. 198). There is no mark recorded for him at that date although the mark registered by his son, Jean Harache II, in 1726, appears on smallwork of the late 17th century. His address is given as Riders Court. He died in 1734. He was in receipt of Royal Bounty from 1722. Jean Harache II Jean Harache II was born in 1698 (Huguenot Society Quarto Series, 29, p. 64), the son of Jean Harache, and the likelihood is that he was apprenticed to his father although no record of this has, as yet, been found. He was describing himself as a jeweler when he gave testimony in a Chancery case in 1722 and he too gave his address as Riders Court, at that time having been there ‚Äònear 25 years‚Äô. The mark recorded in the smallworkers‚Äô register at Goldsmiths‚Äô Hall in 1726 against the name Jean Harache, though appearing on plate of the late 17th century and thus that of Jean (I), must have been that of Jean (II) at this date. Jeremy Harache and brothers Jeremy Harache arrived in England by 16 September 1683 (Huguenot Society Quarto Series,, 21, p. 136). He was born in Rouen in 1654 and was baptized at Le Grand-Quevilly on 26 May. Neither his mark nor examples of his work have, as yet, been identified and he returned to France in 1697, where he died before 1702. Jeremy was followed in 1686 by his brothers Pierre Harache (junior) and Abraham. Pierre Harache (junior) was baptised at Quevilly 11 April 1653 (Societe du Parler Fran√ßais) and was only distantly related to Pierre Harache (the elder). He was endenizened 29 September 1698, possibly having worked as a journeyman for his namesake until then, and was made free of the Goldsmiths‚Äô Company 24 October 1698. He entered three marks at Goldsmiths‚Äô Hall as a largeworker 25 October 1698 giving his address as Compton Street (Mark Book-Goldsmiths' Hall, London). In 1703 he took Jacques des Rumeaux as his apprentice but was in receipt of Royal Bounty between 1714 and 1717, when he returned to France, giving his address at that time as Grafton Street. He died in France in 1718. Following the recent discovery of the date of death of Pierre Harache (the elder) and a reassessment of the marks of both Pierres, many important works previously attributed to the younger man have been re-attributed to the elder, including the wine cistern of 1704 belonging to the Worshipful Company of Barbers, Barber-Surgeons Hall, Monkwell Square, Wood Street, London and the Methuen Dish of 1703 at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. Abraham Harache Abraham Harache was born in 1661 and was baptized at Quevilly on 9 October. He, like his brother, was a master goldsmith by the time he arrived in London although he appears to have been a smallworker (producing mostly spoons and snuff boxes). He was here by 22 August 1686Huguenot Society Quarto Series, 21, p.136 but was not endenizened until March 1700Huguenot Society Quarto Series,, 18, p.313 and there is no record of his mark although it has been tentatively identified. He too lived at Compton Street on his arrival in England but moved to St. Giles in Great St. Andrew Street, Seven Dials in 1708. He died in 1722 and was buried at St. James‚Äôs Paddington. Francis Harache Francis Harache was born in 1710, the son of Abraham Harache, and apprenticed to Isaac Cabane, silversmith of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, in 1725. On completion of his apprenticeship, he took his brother, Thomas, as his apprentice. He was a smallworker and on entering his mark at Goldsmiths‚Äô Hall in 1738 he gave his address as ‚Äúye Seven Dyals in great St. Andrew Street att ye blackmoors head St. Giles‚Äù. He had a prodigious output and his second mark is believed to be the FH crowned mark that appears on a great deal of smallwork. This datum would presumably have been recorded in the register for smallworkers covering the period May 1739 to July 1758, which is no longer extant. Thomas Harache Thomas Harache was born in 1717, the son of Abraham Harache, and apprenticed to his brother Francis in 1732. On completion of his apprenticeship in 1741 he set up on his own in St Martin's Lane where he remained until 1750. He took apprentices John Jacobs in 1743, and William Danser in 1744, describing himself variously as Silversmith and Snuff box maker. His mark would have been recorded at Goldsmiths‚Äô Hall but would have been in the missing register. On moving to Pall Mall in 1751, he would have registered a second mark and was calling himself a Goldworker at this time. Neither mark has so far been identified. He retired in 1778 at which time he was calling himself a Jeweller, Goldsmith and Toyman. He died a fairly wealthy man, in 1785. Family trading name It is now known that the Haraches traded as a company under the title 'Pet: harache & Co. goldsmiths'National Archives C110/46/155 and that there was a third Pierre Harache in this company who was dealing in second hand silver with Hoares' Bank C. Hoare & Co between 1697 and 1705. Nothing is known of him at present save that his address was given as Little Newport StreetWestminster Archives Centre (W.A.C.A.) 29a-A50 as was that of a third Jean Harache whose background is also unknown at present.

Opened on April 17, 2009, it is the home of the Triple-A Reno Aces of the Pacific Coast League and Reno 1868 FC of the USL Championship. Greater Nevada Field is on the north bank of the Truckee River and welcomes over 500,000 ticketed fans per year. History The drive to build a stadium in the Reno-Sparks area began in 2002, with Sierra Nevada Baseball's purchase of land near the Sparks Marina. In 2003, state legislature passed a Washoe county rental car tax surcharge to partially finance the new stadium. However, Sierra Nevada Baseball's plans fell through when they were unable to secure the private financing portion of construction, as well as the cost to purchase and relocate a Triple-A team. In 2007, SK Baseball stepped in and proposed a new stadium plan, redeveloping an eastern portion of downtown Reno. They entered into an agreement with the county in May 2007, secured financing, and bought the Tucson Sidewinders with the intent of moving them to Reno by the 2009 season. Ground was broken on February 25, 2008, for what was tentatively called Sierra Nevada Stadium. It was constructed on an accelerated schedule, with only 1 year, 50 days between breaking ground and opening day. On April 17, 2009, the Reno Aces played their first home game in Aces Stadium, to an over-capacity crowd of 9,167. They beat the Salt Lake Bees, 11‚Äì1. The stadium hosted the 2013 Triple-A All-Star Game in which the International League All-Stars defeated the Pacific Coast League All-Stars, 4‚Äì3. Reno's Matt Davidson won the Home Run Derby. On September 16, 2015, the United Soccer League announced that Reno had been selected to receive an expansion franchise. Reno 1868 FC began play in 2017 at Greater Nevada Field and is owned and operated by the same management as the Reno Aces. On March 17, 2016, the Aces and Greater Nevada Credit Union announced a 15-year agreement for naming rights, changing the name of the stadium from Aces Ballpark to Greater Nevada Field. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Features Greater Nevada Field has an official capacity of 9,100, with 6,500 fixed individual stadium seats, and the rest through general admission. The park has a berm beyond right field, and has standing room surrounding the entire field. In addition, there are two \\"party zones\\" with picnic table seating, 22 luxury skyboxes, a 150-person club suite, and two 15-person luxury dugout suites located immediately behind home plate. Due to the flexibility of party zones, skyboxes and large general admission areas, game attendance can regularly be above the official stadium capacity. Four concession stands are staggered throughout the stands. Great Basin Beer is served on premises. At elevation, Greater Nevada Field has a very deep field, at its shallowest point and at its deepest point. Therefore, home runs are less likely to occur, and line drive triples are more likely. The elevation of the natural grass playing field is approximately above sea level and is aligned northeast by north. Trent Oeltjen hit the park's first triple on opening night, but the first home run came the following night. Josh Whitesell hit it in the bottom of the first inning, and went on to hit the park's first grand slam in the bottom of the 7th inning. For Reno 1868 FC matches, the field is converted into an all-natural grass surface by laying sod over the infield from third base to halfway between first and second base. The pitcher's mound and home plate are covered with tarps, and temporary sideboards and endboards are erected from left field to right-center and along the right field wall. The field is oriented in an east- west layout, with one goal in front of what is normally the Aces bullpen in right field and the other goal near Sections 101-102 along the left field line. Several sections of seating behind home plate are covered with tarps and not sold during soccer matches, while Sections 102, 109 and the bullpen area are reserved for supporters groups. There are over 10 locations to park at Greater Nevada Field. Greater Nevada Field offers valet parking, suite-level parking, and parking for those with a disabled parking permit directly across the stadium. The Basin Street nine-story parking structure, National Bowling Stadium, and downtown casinos are also options for patrons. Upstairs at Greater Nevada Field On September 15, 2009, construction began on phase 2 of the stadium, the Freight House District. The grand opening coincided with the opening day of the Reno Aces 2010 season. Now known as \\"Upstairs at Greater Nevada Field\\", the upper level contains an outdoor bar and stage area for concerts, Bugsy's Sports Bar (which overlooks the left field line), Good Hops (formerly Duffy's Ale House) and the 250 Lounge. The lower level contained Arroyo Mexican Grill until 2017 and Red's Broken Bat BBQ from 2017-2019. The space is currently vacant.

The broadcast is termed \\"atomic\\" because it either eventually completes correctly at all participants, or all participants abort without side effects. Atomic broadcasts are an important distributed computing primitive.  Properties  The following properties are usually required from an atomic broadcast protocol: # Validity: if a correct participant broadcasts a message, then all correct participants will eventually receive it. # Uniform Agreement: if one correct participant receives a message, then all correct participants will eventually receive that message. # Uniform Integrity: a message is received by each participant at most once, and only if it was previously broadcast. # Uniform Total Order: the messages are totally ordered in the mathematical sense; that is, if any correct participant receives message 1 first and message 2 second, then every other correct participant must receive message 1 before message 2. Rodrigues and Raynal and Schiper et al. define the integrity and validity properties of atomic broadcast slightly differently. Note that total order is not equivalent to FIFO order, which requires that if a process sent message 1 before it sent message 2, then all participants must receive message 1 before receiving message 2. It is also not equivalent to \\"causal order\\", where message 2 \\"depends on\\" or \\"occurs after\\" message 1 then all participants must receive message 2 after receiving message 1. While a strong and useful condition, total order requires only that all participants receive the messages in the same order, but does not place other constraints on that order.  Fault Tolerance  Designing an algorithm for atomic broadcasts is relatively easy if it can be assumed that computers will not fail. For example, if there are no failures, atomic broadcast can be achieved simply by having all participants communicate with one \\"leader\\" which determines the order of the messages, with the other participants following the leader. However, real computers are faulty; they fail and recover from failure at unpredictable, possibly inopportune, times. For example, in the follow-the-leader algorithm, what if the leader fails at the wrong time? In such an environment achieving atomic broadcasts is difficult. A number of protocols have been proposed for performing atomic broadcast, under various assumptions about the network, failure models, availability of hardware support for multicast, and so forth.  Equivalent to Consensus  In order for the conditions for atomic broadcast to be satisfied, the participants must effectively \\"agree\\" on the order of receipt of the messages. Participants recovering from failure, after the other participants have \\"agreed\\" an order and started to receive the messages, must be able to learn and comply with the agreed order. Such considerations indicate that in systems with crash failures, atomic broadcast and consensus are equivalent problems. A value can be proposed by a process for consensus by atomically broadcasting it, and a process can decide a value by selecting the value of the first message which it atomically receives. Thus, consensus can be reduced to atomic broadcast. Conversely, a group of participants can atomically broadcast messages by achieving consensus regarding the first message to be received, followed by achieving consensus on the next message, and so forth until all the messages have been received. Thus, atomic broadcast reduces to consensus. This was demonstrated more formally and in greater detail by Xavier D√©fago, et al. A fundamental result in distributed computing is that achieving consensus in asynchronous systems in which even one crash failure can occur is impossible in the most general case. This was shown in 1985 by Michael J. Fischer, Nancy Lynch, and Mike Paterson, and is sometimes called the FLP result. Since consensus and atomic broadcast are equivalent, FLP applies also to atomic broadcast. The FLP result does not prohibit the implementation of atomic broadcast in practice, but it does require making less stringent assumptions than FLP in some respect, such as about processor and communication timings.  Algorithms  The Chandra-Toueg algorithm is a consensus-based solution to atomic broadcast. Another solution has been put forward by Rodrigues and Raynal. The Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast (ZAB) protocol is the basic building block for Apache ZooKeeper, a fault-tolerant distributed coordination service which underpins Hadoop and many other important distributed systems. Ken Birman has proposed the virtual synchrony execution model for distributed systems, the idea of which is that all processes observe the same events in the same order. A total ordering of the messages being received, as in atomic broadcast, is one (though not the only) method for attaining virtually synchronous message receipt.

Its existence and status are uncertain and controversial, and the body has only been formally convened twice, once to try Joseph Smith in 1834 and once in 1844 when Sidney Rigdon was excommunicated in absentia. The Common Council of the Church is sometimes confused with the Council of the Church.See, e.g., Bruce R. McConkie, 1966. Mormon Doctrine, 2d ed. Salt Lake City:Bookcraft, p. 150 where the description of the Council of the Church is given the title Common Council of the Church. Origin and duties The council was first spoken of in a revelation by Joseph Smith on March 28, 1835: > And inasmuch as a President of the High Priesthood shall transgress, he > shall be had in remembrance before the common council of the church, who > shall be assisted by twelve counselors of the High Priesthood; And their > decision upon his head shall be an end of controversy concerning him. Thus, > none shall be exempted from the justice and the laws of God\\".Doctrine and > Covenants 107:82-84. Church commentators have interpreted this to mean that the council that would have the power to discipline or remove the President of the Church or a member of the First Presidency would be composed of the Presiding Bishopric of the church and twelve other high priests asked by the Presiding Bishop to assist in the disciplinary procedures. For example, Apostle John A. Widtsoe stated: > \\"Should occasion ever arise that one of the First Presidency must be tried > for crime or neglect of duty, his case would come before the Presiding > Bishop with his counselors, and twelve High Priests especially chosen for > the purpose. This would be a tribunal extraordinary from which there is no > appeal.\\"John A. Widtsoe, 1939. Priesthood and Church Government in The > Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, > 214. Cf. 253. The twelve counselors could be composed of the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; however, there is no formal requirement that these individuals be chosen. A later revelation given to the Prophet Joseph on January 12, 1838, revealed more instructions, because of \\"wicked and aspiring men\\", \\"concerning the trying of the First Presidency of the Church of Latter- day Saints for transgression\\". This revelation was not put into the Doctrine and Covenants.\\"Revelation, 12 January 1838‚ÄìA\\" Trial of Joseph Smith On 11 August 1834, the Council formally convened for the first time to consider charges made by Sylvester Smith against Joseph Smith after the return of Zion's Camp.

Smith, Isaac Story, Amasa Lyman Peter Shirts, Truman Wait, Roswell Evans, Alpheus Cutler, and Thomas Burdick acting as the twelve high priests;History of the Church 2:142‚Äì144. Oliver Cowdery and Orson Hyde also participated as clerks to the Council, and Sidney Rigdon participated as a member of the First Presidency. The Council determined that Joseph Smith had \\"acted in every respect in an honorable and proper manner with all monies and properties entrusted to his charge.\\"History of the Church 2:143.

Lyman, William W. Phelps, William Marks, Charles C. Rich, and Ezra T. Benson acting as the twelve counselors.Note that only the first eight of these individuals were members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at the time. The purpose of the council was to discuss possible discipline for Sidney Rigdon, who was a counselor to Joseph Smith in the First Presidency prior to Smith's death in June 1844. Since Smith's death, Rigdon had claimed the right to lead the church and be its \\"guardian\\" until a new First Presidency could be organized. The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, led by Brigham Young, had also been claiming the right to lead the Latter Day Saints. At the trial, > \\"Very serious charges were made against Elder Rigdon for insubordination, > for claiming to hold keys and authority above any man or set of men in the > church, even superior authority and keys thereof than those held by the > Twelve; and likewise he had ordained men to positions‚Äîplaces and offices not > recognized as properly belonging to this church.

Rigdon had been asked to appear before the council but had refused to appear.Jedediah M. Grant, 1844. Collection of Facts Relative to the Course Taken by Elder Sidney Rigdon, Philadelphia: Brown, Bicking, & Guilbert, p. 19. After a discussion of Rigdon's behavior by the members of the council, Whitney presented a motion to excommunicate Rigdon from the church \\"and deliver [him] over to the buffetings of satan until he repents\\". The motion was unanimously carried. The Latter Day Saints in attendance at the public meeting were then invited by Young to ratify the decision of the council.

Marcelino. It was remade in 2007 via Sineserye Presents. Plot Everyone notices how different Andrew (Ricky Davao) and Gillian (Lorna Tolentino) look from their respective sets of parents but no one really makes a fuss about it. What is even more surprising is that the two have never felt close with the families growing up. Instead, Gillian becomes more closely attached to Andrew's parents (Ricky Belmonte and Marita Zobel) while Andrew feels more drawn to Gillian's parents, Bernardo (Dante Rivero) and Patria (Gina Pare√±o). Little do they suspect that this is because Andrew and Gillian had been switched at birth. Andrew's real father, Bernardo, a poor private driver, decides that Andrew will have a better life growing up with his rich bosses. So he makes sure that only he and his wife Patria know that he has switched the two babies when the mothers both gave birth at a provincial hospital. No amount of pleading from Patria can make him change his mind. Out of frustration, Patria resorts to maltreating Gillian. The latter finds comfort with Andrew's mother, Rose, and later with Mark, (Gary Valenciano) a rich suitor. Jealous of Gillian's new found attention, Andrew decides to force himself on Gillian, an act which leads to the revelation of the secret of their parentage.

This is an eel trap that has been modified to better catch deep sea fauna. Life on the Edge 2005 Expedition. Deep-sea exploration is the investigation of physical, chemical, and biological conditions on the sea bed, for scientific or commercial purposes. Deep-sea exploration is considered a relatively recent human activity compared to the other areas of geophysical research, as the depths of the sea have been investigated only during comparatively recent years. The ocean depths still remain a largely unexplored part of the planet, and form a relatively undiscovered domain. In general, modern scientific deep-sea exploration can be said to have begun when French scientist Pierre Simon de Laplace investigated the average depth of the Atlantic ocean by observing tidal motions registered on Brazilian and African coasts. He calculated the depth to be , a value later proven quite accurate by echo-sounding measurement techniques.Deep Sea Exploration.\\" World of Earth Science. Ed. K. Lee Lerner and Brenda Wilmoth Lerner. Gale Cengage, 2003. eNotes.com. 2006. 7 Dec, 2009 Later on, due to increasing demand for the installment of submarine cables, accurate measurements of the sea floor depth were required and the first investigations of the sea bottom were undertaken. The first deep-sea life forms were discovered in 1864 when Norwegian researchers obtained a sample of a stalked crinoid at a depth of . From 1872 to 1876, a landmark ocean study was carried out by British scientists aboard the HMS Challenger, a sailing vessel that was redesigned into a laboratory ship. The Challenger expedition covered , and shipboard scientists collected hundreds of samples and hydrographic measurements, discovering more than 4,700 new species of marine life, including deep-sea organisms. They are also credited with providing the first real view of major seafloor features such as the deep ocean basins. The first instrument used for deep-sea investigation was the sounding weight, used by British explorer Sir James Clark Ross. With this instrument, he reached a depth of in 1840. The Challenger expedition used similar instruments called Baillie sounding machines to extract samples from the sea bed. In the 20th century, deep-sea exploration advanced considerably through a series of technological inventions, ranging from the sonar system, which can detect the presence of objects underwater through the use of sound, to manned deep-diving submersibles. In 1960, Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in the bathyscaphe Trieste into the deepest part of the world's oceans, the Mariana Trench. On 25 March 2012, filmmaker James Cameron descended into the Mariana Trench in the Deepsea Challenger, and, for the first time, is expected to have filmed and sampled the bottom. Despite these advances in deep-sea exploration, the voyage to the ocean bottom is still a challenging experience. Scientists are working to find ways to study this extreme environment from the shipboard. With more sophisticated use of fiber optics, satellites, and remote-control robots, scientists hope to, one day, explore the deep sea from a computer screen on the deck rather than out of a porthole.  Milestones of deep sea exploration  The extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies to endure, which has been the main reason why its exploration has had a comparatively short history. Some important milestones of deep sea exploration are listed below: *1521: Ferdinand Magellan tried to measure the depth of the Pacific Ocean with a weighted line, but did not find the bottom. *1818: The British researcher Sir John Ross was the first to find that the deep sea is inhabited by life when catching jellyfish and worms in about depth with a special device. *1843: Nevertheless, Edward Forbes claimed that diversity of life in the deep sea is little and decreases with increasing depth. He stated that there could be no life in waters deeper than , the so- called Abyssus theory. *1850: Near the Lofoten, Michael Sars found a rich variety of deep sea fauna in a depth of , thereby refuting the Abyssus Theory.Ludwig Darmstaedter (Hrsg.): Handbuch zur Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der Technik, Springer, Berlin 1908, S. 521 *1872‚Äì1876: The first systematic deep sea exploration was conducted by the Challenger expedition on board the ship led by Charles Wyville Thomson. This expedition revealed that the deep sea harbours a diverse, specialized biota. *1890‚Äì1898: First Austrian-Hungarian deep sea expedition on board the ship led by Franz Steindachner in the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea. *1898‚Äì1899: First German deep sea expedition on board the ship Valdivia led by Carl Chun; found many new species from depths greater than in the southern Atlantic Ocean. *1930: William Beebe and Otis Barton were the first humans to reach the Deep Sea when diving in the so-called Bathysphere, made from steel. They reached a depth of , where they observed jellyfish and shrimp. *1934: The Bathysphere reached a depth of . *1948: Otis Barton set out for a new record, reaching a depth of . *1960: Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh reached the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, descending to a depth of in their deep sea vessel , where they observed fish and other deep sea organisms. *2012: The vessel , piloted by James Cameron, completed the second manned voyage and first solo mission to the bottom of the Challenger Deep. *2018: , piloted by Victor Vescovo, completed the first mission to the deepest point of the Atlantic Ocean, diving below the ocean surface to the base of the Puerto Rico Trench. *2020: Kathryn Sullivan and Vanessa O'Brien completed their missions, becoming the first women to reach the bottom of Challenger Deep at 10,925m (35,843 ft) Oceanographic instrumentation Deep sea exploration apparatus,1910 The sounding weight, one of the first instruments used for the sea bottom investigation, was designed as a tube on the base which forced the seabed in when it hit the bottom of the ocean. British explorer Sir James Clark Ross fully employed this instrument to reach a depth of in 1840.Deep-Sea Exploration: Earth's Final Frontier Only a Portion of the Potential of the Oceans Has Been Tapped, but It Is Clear That Exploring and Improving Our Understanding of the Ocean and Its Influence on Global Events Are among Our Most Important Challenges Today Journal article by Stephen L. Baird; The Technology Teacher, Vol. 65, 2005. Sounding weights used on were the slightly more advanced \\"Baillie sounding machine\\". The British researchers used wire- line soundings to investigate sea depths and collected hundreds of biological samples from all oceans except the Arctic. Also used on HMS Challenger were dredges and scoops, suspended on ropes, with which samples of the sediment and biological specimens of the seabed could be obtained. A more advanced version of the sounding weight is the gravity corer. The gravity corer allows researchers to sample and study sediment layers at the bottom of oceans. The corer consists of an open-ended tube with a lead weight and a trigger mechanism that releases the corer from its suspension cable when the corer is lowered over the seabed and a small weight touches the ground. The corer falls into the seabed and penetrates it to a depth of up to . By lifting the corer, a long, cylindrical sample is extracted in which the structure of the seabed‚Äôs layers of sediment is preserved. Recovering sediment cores allows scientists to see the presence or absence of specific fossils in the mud that may indicate climate patterns at times in the past, such as during the ice ages. Samples of deeper layers can be obtained with a corer mounted in a drill. The drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution is equipped to extract cores from depths of as much as below the ocean bottom. (See Ocean Drilling Program) Echo-sounding instruments have also been widely used to determine the depth of the sea bottom since World War II. This instrument is used primarily for determining the depth of water by means of an acoustic echo. A pulse of sound sent from the ship is reflected from the sea bottom back to the ship, the interval of time between transmission and reception being proportional to the depth of the water. By registering the time lapses between outgoing and returning signals continuously on paper tape, a continuous mapping of the seabed is obtained. The majority of the ocean floor has been mapped in this way. In addition, high-resolution television cameras, thermometers, pressure meters, and seismographs are other notable instruments for deep-sea exploration invented by the technological advance. These instruments are either lowered to the sea bottom by long cables or directly attached to submersible buoys. Deep-sea currents can be studied by floats carrying an ultrasonic sound device so that their movements can be tracked from aboard the research vessel. Such vessels themselves are equipped with state -of-art navigational instruments, such as satellite navigation systems, and global positioning systems that keep the vessel in a live position relative to a sonar beacon on the bottom of the ocean. Oceanographic submersibles Because of the high pressure, the depth to which a diver can descend without special equipment is limited. The deepest recorded descent made by a skin diver is . Revolutionary new diving suits, such as the \\"JIM suit,\\" allow divers to reach depths up to approximately . Some additional suits feature thruster packs that can boost a diver to different locations underwater. To explore even deeper depths, deep-sea explorers must rely on specially constructed steel chambers to protect them. The American explorer William Beebe, also a naturalist from Columbia University in New York, working with fellow engineer Otis Barton of Harvard University, designed the first practical bathysphere to observe marine species at depths that could not be reached by a diver. In 1930 Beebe and Barton reached a depth of , and in 1934. The potential danger was that if the cable broke, the occupants could not return to the surface. During the dive, Beebe peered out of a porthole and reported his observations by telephone to Barton who was on the surface. In 1948, Swiss physicist Auguste Piccard tested a much deeper-diving vessel he invented called the bathyscaphe, a navigable deep-sea vessel with its gasoline-filled float and suspended chamber or gondola of spherical steel. On an experimental dive in the Cape Verde Islands, his bathyscaphe successfully withstood the pressure on it at , but its body was severely damaged by heavy waves after the dive. In 1954, with this bathyscaphe, Piccard reached a depth of . In 1953, his son Jacques Piccard joined in building a new and improved bathyscaphe , which dived to in field trials. The United States Navy acquired Trieste in 1958 and equipped it with a new cabin to enable it to reach deep ocean trenches. In 1960, Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in Trieste to the deepest known point on Earth - the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, successfully making the deepest dive in history: . An increasing number of occupied submersibles are now employed around the world. For example, the American-built , operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is a three-person submarine that can dive to about and is equipped with a mechanical manipulator to collect bottom samples. Operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Alvin is designed to carry a crew of three people to depths of . The submarine is equipped with lights, cameras, computers, and highly maneuverable robotic arms for collecting samples in the darkness of the ocean's depths. Alvin made its first test dive in 1964, and has performed more than 3,000 dives to average depths of . Alvin has also been involved in a wide variety of research projects, such as one where giant tube worms were discovered on the Pacific Ocean floor near the Gal√°pagos Islands. =Unmanned submersibles= Describing the operation and use of autonomous landers in deep sea research. One of the first unmanned deep sea vehicles was developed by the University of California with a grant from the Allan Hancock Foundation in the early 1950s to develop a more economical method of taking photos miles under the sea with an unmanned steel high-pressure sphere called a benthograph, which contained a camera and strobe light. The original benthograph built by USC was very successful in taking a series of underwater photos until it became wedged between some rocks and could not be retrieved.\\"Deep Sea Photographers.\\" Popular Mechanics, January 1953, p. 105. Remote operated vehicles (ROVs) are also seeing increasing use in underwater exploration. These submersibles are piloted through a cable which connects to the surface ship, and can reach depths of up to . New developments in robotics have also led to the creation of AUVs, or autonomous underwater vehicles. The robotic submarines are programmed in advance, and receive no instruction from the surface. A Hybrid ROV (HROV) combines features of both ROVs and AUV, operating independently or with a cable. was employed in 1985 to locate the wreck of ; the smaller was also used to explore the shipwreck. Scientific results In 1974, Alvin (operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Deep Sea Place Research Center), the French bathyscaphe Archim√®de, and the French diving saucer CYANA, assisted by support ships and , explored the great rift valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, southwest of the Azores. About 5,200 photographs of the region were taken, and samples of relatively young solidified magma were found on each side of the central fissure of the rift valley, giving additional proof that the seafloor spreads at this site at a rate of about per year (see plate tectonics,). In a series of dives conducted between 1979‚Äì1980 into the Gal√°pagos rift, off the coast of Ecuador, French, Italian, Mexican, and U.S. scientists found vents, nearly high and about across, discharging a mixture of hot water (up to ) and dissolved metals in dark, smoke-like plumes (see hydrothermal vent,). These hot springs play an important role in the formation of deposits that are enriched in copper, nickel, cadmium, chromium, and uranium.

Born in Brazil, Indiana, into a family of musicians, Davis developed an interest in music during his childhood. He learned to play the trumpet and by the age of 13 was performing with his grandfather's band. After graduating from high school he worked as a musician for several orchestras, including theater orchestras in nearby Terre Haute, Indiana such as Paul Johnson's orchestra and the Leo Baxter Orchestra. Art Davis, his younger brother, also worked for Leo Baxter. Davis's work with bands led him to discover and develop his ability as a scat singer. By 1933 was living in New York City. He formed his own trio and recorded several songs with them. From the mid-1930s he worked with Fred Waring as a musician and vocalist, and his success during this time led him to Hollywood. He appeared in his first film in 1937, and the same year appeared in the film Hollywood Hotel, where he introduced the Johnny Mercer song \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\". His lively rendition became popular and became closely associated with the film industry. He appeared in fifteen films including Campus Cinderella (1938), Cowboy from Brooklyn (1938), Brother Rat (1938), Mr. Chump (1938),'A Child Is Born (1939) and Sarong Girl (1943). Davis's work on radio included being a vocalist on Nitwit Court. Davis continued to work in the music industry throughout the 1940s and 1950s, and spent several years in Detroit, Michigan where he was a popular television performer. Davis married Martha Lee Garver on April 2, 1934. He eventually settled in Texas, and died in Pecos from a heart attack during a hunting trip.

Located on Shediac Bay, an inlet of the Northumberland Strait, Pointe-du-Ch√™ne, also called La Pointe, is the home of Parlee Beach Provincial Park. It was once the terminus of the European and North American Railway and was a key stopover for Pan-Am's Trans Atlantic air service inaugurated in 1939. Pointe-du-Ch√™ne became a cottage resort area in the early 20th century. Summer excursion trains from Moncton brought day trippers to the seashore. The railway terminus and proximity to Parlee Beach (originally known as Gould's Beach and Belliveau's Beach, before being renamed in 1959), made it an ideal location for cottages. History Pointe-Du-Ch√™ne has from the very beginning been closely related to the neighbouring community of Shediac; French cartographer Jumeau mapped the whole area along Shediac Bay as ‚ÄúChedaik,‚Äù and Monsignor St. Valier, who was Bishop of Quebec, referred to the area as ‚ÄúChedic‚Äù during a 1686 pastoral visit to Acadia.John Edward Belliveau: ‚ÄúA Place Called Pointe Du Chene‚Äù. Private Printing, 1974 By 1815, the community was known as ‚ÄúOak Point,‚Äù due to the abundance of oak trees that grew there. By 1862, the French variant of the name, Pointe-du-Ch√™ne, was adopted. Though Pointe-du-Ch√™ne first began to be settled by English-speaking settlers as early as 1810, the community did not begin to prosper until 1853 when a new government wharf was constructed. Until that time, shipping, ferrying, and general trade were conducted from the Queen's Wharf at Shediac Cape. Construction of the wharf coincided with the construction of the European and North American Railway, which chose Pointe-du-Ch√™ne as its eastern terminus. This allowed strong potato, and livestock industries to arise in the community. As yet there was no industry in all of Shediac Bay as strong as the community's lumber industry, but as the forests of coastal Maine and England were close to depletion at this time, the abundance of oak trees in the area was considered a Godsend. By the 1840s, there were as many as twenty vessels waiting to load lumber at the wharf each day during the shipping season. Due to the economic boom brought on by the new industry, Saint-Martins-In-The- Woods Anglican Church in nearby Shediac Cape applied for a land in Pointe-Du- Chene. They were granted , and to this day more than two-thirds of the land in Pointe-Du-Chene belongs to the church, which rents the land to the occupants. A notable historical event was the arrival of the first trans-Atlantic flight by Marshal Italo Balbo. On July 13, 1933 Balbo landed in Pointe-du-Ch√™ne accompanied by an armada of 24 Italian seaplanes. The armada departed from Rome, travelled to the Azores and Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador, and then landed in Pointe-du-Ch√™ne, ultimately travelling on to Chicago. Balbo stayed at the home of the late Dr. John Clarence Webster, and from there he telephoned \\"Il Duce\\" Benito Mussolini to describe the voyage. Later in the decade, during the summer of 1939, Pan American Airways established a trans- Atlantic air-route, using Pointe-du-Ch√™ne as one of its terminals. Pan Am Clipper flying boats departed from Port Washington, Long Island, stopped at the Pointe-du-Ch√™ne wharf, then travelled to Botwood, Newfoundland and Foynes, Ireland or Lisbon, Portugal, finally terminating in Southampton. The Clipper service predated the use of runways for large aircraft, and flying boats were required to land in the water. Pointe-du-Ch√™ne is, to many, synonymous with nearby Parlee Beach. When Moncton emerged as a major city in New Brunswick, the Sunday train to Pointe-du-Ch√™ne became an institution. With upwards of 20 railway passenger cars filled with families and children, the train would leave the Moncton railway station at 1:30 pm for the Pointe-du-Ch√™ne railway station; the return train would depart at 7:00 pm. To this day, Parlee Beach Provincial Park is still a popular summer destination for residents of Moncton and visitors to New Brunswick.

He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . During a 14-year Major League career, Mueller played for the Cincinnati Reds, Boston Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Giants. After his playing career, Mueller managed in minor league baseball and coached in the Majors for the Giants (1956), Chicago Cubs (1957) and Cleveland Indians (1966). But he became best known as the everyday catcher of the 1944 Reds. In , Mueller had warmed up for his iron-man role by catching in 141 games for Cincinnati, including every game from July 31 through the end of the campaign. Then, in 1944, he started and caught in every Red game ‚Äî 155, including an official contest that was ruled a tie. While he did not catch every inning for the 1944 Reds (backups Len Rice, Joe Just and Johnny Riddle handled 17 total chances in a total of 43 innings caught), Mueller caught 140 complete games and 1,329 innings; he handled 545 chances, threw out 39 percent of would-be base-stealers, and batted a career-high .286 with ten home runs and 73 runs batted in.

On June 13, 1949, he was traded to the New York Giants for catcher Walker Cooper. Career statistics In a fourteen-year career, Mueller played in 985 games, accumulating 733 hits in 2,911 at bats for a .252 career batting average along with 56 home runs, 373 runs batted in and a .314 on-base percentage.

Sir John Willes (29 November 168515 December 1761) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1724 to 1737. He was the longest-serving Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas since the 15th century, serving 24 years. Life Willes was born at Bishop's Itchington in Warwickshire; his father, the Reverend John Willes, vicar of the parish, was a younger son of the long-established Willes family of Newbold Comyn. Dr. Edward Willes, Bishop of Bath and Wells, was his brother. Their mother was Anne (or Mary) Walker, daughter of Sir William Walker, who was three times Mayor of Oxford between 1674 and 1685. Willes was educated at Lichfield Grammar School and matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 28 November 1700, aged 14. He was also elected a fellow of All Souls. While he was a student at Oxford he got into serious trouble for publishing pamphlets about the Government which were arguably seditious, and was threatened with prosecution as a result. His career was saved by the intervention of his fellow student John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, who pleaded for clemency. Granville often said in later years that he had made Willes a judge by saving him from the pillory. Willes joined Lincoln's Inn in 1708, and was called to the bar in 1713. In 1719 he became a King's Counsel, and in 1726 he was appointed a Puisne Justice of Chester on the Chester circuit, rising to Chief Justice of Chester in 1729. Astrop Park House Willes entered Parliament as MP for Launceston in 1722, and subsequently also represented Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and West Looe. In 1734 he was appointed Attorney General, and was knighted in 1736. In 1735 he purchased the manor of Astrop, Kings Sutton, Northamptonshire where he built a new mansion Astrop House, (now a Grade II* listed building). In 1737 he was elevated to become Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, the third most senior judge in the English legal system as it then existed, and held this post until his death in 1761; at the same time he was appointed to the Privy Council. Family By his wife Margaret Brewster Willes had four sons and four daughters. He is also reputed to have had numerous illegitimate children, none of whom he acknowledged or made any provision for. Of his legitimate children John (1721‚Äì1784) inherited Astrop Park and became a Member of Parliament and Edward (1723‚Äì1787) followed his father to the Bar and in due course became Solicitor General (1766‚Äì1768) and a judge of the Court of King's Bench. Sir John also encouraged his younger cousin Edward of Newbold Comyn to become a barrister: Edward went on to have a distinguished career, ending as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. A grandson was Robert Merry. Character Sir John was described by Horace Walpole as a man of open character, sharp intelligence and \\"strong passions which could not be concealed\\", He was notorious for gambling and womanising, and was said to have several illegitimate children. When objections were made to his promotion on the grounds of his debauched lifestyle, Sir Robert Walpole reportedly joked that he had always understood that such conduct was an essential qualification for high judicial office. On the other hand it was generally agreed that his reputation prevented him from becoming Lord Chancellor, an office he undoubtedly wanted and was qualified for on grounds of legal ability. William Hogarth portrayed him unflatteringly in a number of cartoons. He was notably severe towards all legal practitioners, especially attorneys, who appeared in his court, and this severity caused a notable falling off of business in the Common Pleas.

Born in Trotter, near Connellsville in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, Mullin was signed by the Tigers before the 1937 season as a 19-year-old amateur free agent. A left-handed hitter who threw right-handed, Mullin was listed at and . Mullin reached the major leagues at age 22 in the final week of the 1940 season, going hitless in four at bats. The Tigers won the American League pennant in 1940, however Mullin did not play in the World Series. He started the 1941 season in the minor leagues with the Buffalo Bisons, then was brought up midseason, making a big impression, batting .345 with a .400 on-base percentage and a .509 slugging percentage. In just 54 games, Mullin had 76 hits, scored 42 runs, with 21 extra base hits. Based on his performance in 1941, Mullin appeared to be a rising star. However, World War II intervened and Mullin joined the United States Army, missing four full seasons during the prime of his athletic life from ages 25‚Äì28. Mullin returned to the Tigers after the war in 1946 and became a solid performer. His best seasons were 1947 and 1948, the only seasons he played in more than 110 games. In 1947, Mullin was among the American League leaders with 28 doubles and 49 extra base hits. He was elected to the American League All Star Team and finished the 1947 season with a .459 on-base percentage, a .470 slugging percentage and an OPS (on-base plus slugging) rating of .829. In 1948, Mullin was again chosen for the All Star Team. He finished the 1948 campaign with a .385 on-base percentage (driven by 143 hits and 77 bases on balls) and a .504 slugging percentage‚Äî8th best in the AL. His OPS rating in 1948 was .889 OPS‚Äî7th best in the AL behind the likes of Hall of Famers Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Lou Boudreau. Mullin was also among the 1948 league leaders in triples (22), home runs (23), and at bats per home run (21.6). After the 1948 season, Mullin played largely as a reserve outfielder and left-handed hitting pinch hitter. On June 26, 1949, Mullin hit three home runs in a single game. Mullin had 57 pinch hitting appearances in 1953, retiring at the end of the season, a month shy of his 36th birthday. In ten major league seasons, Mullin played in 834 games for the Tigers, 637 as an outfielder and the rest as a pinch hitter. He finished with a career .271 batting average, 676 hits, 87 home runs and 385 RBIs, a .358 on-base percentage, .453 slugging percentage, and .811 OPS rating. He finished his career with a .970 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. Mullin remained in baseball after his playing days ended as a scout, minor league manager and (from mid-1963 through 1966) first- base coach for the Tigers, and a coach for the Cleveland Indians (1967) and Montreal Expos (1979‚Äì81).

The native of Houston, Texas, stood tall and weighed . Munger pitched a complete game, 12‚Äì3 victory over the Boston Red Sox in Game 4 of the 1946 World Series at Fenway Park. He gave up nine hits, including a home run by future Hall of Famer Bobby Doerr, but only one run was earned. Munger's victory in his only World Series appearance was the only Cardinal win not registered by teammate Harry Brecheen, whose three triumphs propelled the Redbirds to a seven-game World Series championship over the Red Sox. A three-time National League All-Star, Munger worked in 273 regular- season Major League games during his career, winning 77 and losing 56 (.583) with an earned run average of 3.83. He struck out 564 batters in 1,228 innings pitched. In 1944, he won 11 of 14 decisions in 21 games, 12 as a starter, with a 1.34 earned run average. He entered the United States Army for World War II service during the middle of that campaign, and did not qualify for the National League's ERA title. He also missed the 1944 World Series, which delivered another Cardinal championship. Munger took a regular turn in the Cardinal starting rotation from mid-1946 through 1950, then was traded to the Pirates in May 1952. Pittsburgh sent Munger to their top minor league affiliate, the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, and he responded with 17- and 23-win seasons in 1954‚Äì55. During the latter year, at age 36, he registered 25 complete games and an ERA of 1.85. The standout season brought Munger to the Major Leagues for one last campaign, as a relief pitcher and occasional starter for the 1956 Pirates. All told, as a minor leaguer, Munger won 152 games; as a professional, he compiled a 229‚Äì174 (.568) record during a career that stretched from 1937 to 1958.

He was an outfielder in the Major Leagues from 1950 through 1960 for the Washington Senators, New York Yankees, Kansas City Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers. He also played for the National Basketball League's Chicago American Gears in 1946‚Äì47. Later in his baseball career, Noren was a minor league manager and the third-base coach of the 1972‚Äì73 World Series champion Oakland Athletics. As a player and coach between 1950 and 1975, Noren was a member of five world championship teams. He died at his home in Oceanside, California on November 15, 2019, exactly two weeks before his 95th birthday. Noren was born in Jamestown, New York, but grew up from the age of 12 in Pasadena, California, where he graduated from high school. Noren then attended Pasadena City College and played basketball as well as baseball. His collegiate career was interrupted by service in the United States Army during World War II. Playing career The , Noren threw and batted left-handed. His pro baseball career began in 1946 when he was signed by the Dodgers while they were still in Brooklyn, but 14 years and the transfer of the team to Los Angeles would pass before he'd wear a Dodger uniform. During his four seasons in Brooklyn's farm system, he was named Most Valuable Player of the 1948 Double-A Texas League. Then, in 1949, playing for an earlier \\"hometown\\" franchise, the Hollywood Stars, Noren won the Triple-A Pacific Coast League's MVP Award, hitting .330 with 224 hits, 29 home runs and 130 runs batted in. But the Dodgers had no room for Noren in their outfield in Brooklyn and sold his contract to the American League Washington Senators at the close of the 1949 campaign. Noren responded with a standout 1950 rookie season. He batted .295, established career highs in hits (160), home runs (14) and RBI (98), and finished 15th in the league's MVP race. His sophomore season, , saw only a slight falloff to a .279 batting average and 86 RBI. But 12 games into his third campaign with the Senators, , Noren was sent on May 3 to the Yankees in a six-player trade that brought Jackie Jensen to Washington. For the next 4 seasons, Noren would be a valuable platoon outfielder for Casey Stengel's Yankees, appearing in three World Series (1952; 1953; 1955), all against his original organization, Brooklyn. He started four games as the Yankees' centerfielder in the 1955 World Series, filling in, along with right-handed- swinging Bob Cerv, for an injured Mickey Mantle. But Noren went only 1-for-16 as Brooklyn captured its first world championship. He would hit only .148 (4-for-27) in the three Series in which he appeared. (He was a member of the victorious Yankees, but did not get into that year's Fall Classic.) His best regular season as a Yankee came in , when he batted a career-high .319 in 125 games played. New York won 103 games that season, but finished second to the Cleveland Indians. All told, Noren hit .272 with 31 homers during his 488-game tenure in the Bronx. Noren's trade to the Kansas City Athletics in February 1957 signaled his transition to journeyman status, as he appeared for four teams in the next four seasons. But he turned in strong performances for the 1957 Cardinals and the 1959 Cubs, batting over .300 each time in part-time duty, before closing his career back in Southern California with the transplanted Dodgers as a pinch hitting specialist in 1960. Altogether, Noren played in 1,093 games over 11 MLB seasons. He collected 857 hits, including 157 doubles, 35 triples and 65 home runs, with 453 RBI. He batted .275 lifetime. Defensively, he recorded a .982 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions and first base. Coaching career After his playing days were over, Noren managed the Triple-A Hawaii Islanders in 1962‚Äì63, where he would fine players $50 if they showed up too sunburned to play baseball. The Islanders went 158‚Äì153 during those two seasons, but did not qualify for the Pacific Coast League playoffs. He scouted for the expansion Senators in 1964, spent 1965‚Äì69 out of professional baseball, then managed in the Pittsburgh Pirates' farm system in 1970. From 1971 through 1973, Noren served on the coaching staff of Oakland A's manager Dick Williams, a fellow Pasadena High School alumnus and former minor league teammate. He was a member of the 1971 American League West Division champions, and then worked with two consecutive AL pennant-winners and World Series champions in 1972‚Äì73. When Williams resigned after the 1973 title, Noren remained on the Oakland staff of new manager Alvin Dark.

After only one season with the White Sox, Robinson was traded to the Detroit Tigers for Billy Pierce in November 1948. Robinson became the Tigers starting catcher in 1949 and 1950, providing solid defense, however his batting continued to decline. During a pennant race late in the season, Robinson was involved in a critical play during a game against the Cleveland Indians on September 24.

The song was recorded at the Charles Fuller Productions studio in Tampa, Florida, and was released as a single on Laurie Records. Bowing at #122 on the Bubbling Under the Hot 100 on December 10, 1966, the single skyrocketed to #30 on December 17, 1966 , shot up again to #7 on December 24, 1966 , and peaked at #2 on the Hot 100 during the week of December 31, 1966 (behind the Monkees' \\"I'm a Believer\\"); made number 6 on the Record Retailer (UK) chart in February 1967; and was number one in Australia for five weeks from February 1967. On the Hot 100, \\"Believer\\" at #1 kept \\"Snoopy\\" at #2 from reaching the Hot 100 summit from December 31, 1966 through January 21, 1967, after which \\"Snoopy\\" fell off while \\"Believer\\" stayed at the top for another three weeks. The Royal Guardsmen went on to record several other Snoopy-themed songs, including two follow-ups to \\"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\\" ‚Äì \\"The Return of the Red Baron\\" and \\"Snoopy's Christmas\\" ‚Äì together with other tunes such as \\"Snoopy for President\\". In 2006 they released \\"Snoopy vs Osama\\". Background \\"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\\" was inspired by the comic strip Peanuts by Charles Schulz, which featured a recurring storyline of Snoopy imagining himself in the role of a World War I airman fighting the Red Baron. The song was released approximately one year after the first comic strip featuring Snoopy fighting the Red Baron appeared on Sunday October 10, 1965. Schulz and United Features Syndicate sued the Royal Guardsmen for using the name Snoopy without permission or an advertising license. (The Guardsmen, meanwhile, hedged their bets by recording an alternative version of the song, called \\"Squeaky vs. the Black Knight\\"; some copies of this version were issued by Laurie Records in Canada.) UFS won the suit, the penalty being that all publishing revenues from the song would go to them. Schulz did allow the group to write more Snoopy songs. The song begins with a background commentary in faux German: \\"Achtung! Jetzt wir singen zusammen die Geschichte √ºber den Schweink√∂pfigen Hund und den lieben Red Baron,\\" which is a purposeful mistranslation of the English: \\"Attention! We will now sing together the story of that pig-headed dog [Snoopy] and the beloved Red Baron\\" and features the sound of a German sergeant counting off in ones (\\"eins, zwei, drei, vier\\", after the first verse), and an American sergeant counting off in fours (after the second verse); a fighter plane; machine guns; and a plane in a tailspin (at the end of the last verse). From 1:46 to 1:54 the song quotes a variant of the instrumental chords from The McCoys' version of \\"Hang On Sloopy\\". In the original recording of \\"Snoopy\\", the lyrics \\"Hang on Snoopy, Snoopy hang on\\" were sung at this point. This tactic led to some initial speculation that the Guardsmen were the McCoys under a different name. Prior to release, these lyrics were removed to prevent copyright issues. The song's chorus refers to \\"the bloody Red Baron\\". As \\"bloody\\" is considered a mild expletive in Australia, and some other English-speaking countries, the word was censored (by being \\"bleeped out\\") for radio airplay in Australia during the 1960s. Other releases and cover versions A rare promotional record (only 1000 were pressed, labelled \\"Omnimedia\\") for the advertising arm of Charles Fuller Productions included the removed lyrics \\"Hang on Snoopy\\". It is a two-sided 7\\" that plays at 33-1/3 RPM. The song was featured as a cover version on a children's album of the same name in the early 1970s by The Peter Pan Pop Band & Singers. In 1976 the group \\"The Irish Rovers\\" covered this song on their studio album \\"The Children of the Unicorn\\" under the label of K-Tel International. It was the 12th album by this Irish folk music group. In 1973, a group called \\"The Hotshots!\\" reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart with their cover version of the song, performed in a ska style. In 1967, Italian singer Giorgio Gaber recorded an Italian version of this song, \\"Snoopy contro il Barone Rosso\\". He also recorded a Spanish version, \\"Snoopy contra el Bar√≥n Rojo\\", with lyrics very similar to his Italian version. Also in 1967, Spanish band Los Mustang recorded a different version in Spanish, also titled \\"Snoopy contra el Bar√≥n Rojo\\", with different lyrics from Gaber's version. Also in 1967, Brazilian singer Ronnie Von recorded a version, \\"Soneca Contra o Bar√£o Vermelho\\", Snoopy then being known in Brazil as either Xereta (\\"snoopy\\" in Portuguese) or Soneca (\\"snooze\\") in local editions of the Schulz comic strip. In 1977, a Finnish band Kontra recorded a version in Finnish titled as \\"Ressu ja Punainen Parooni\\". It was released as B-side of their debut single \\"Aja hiljaa isi\\"(Love Records LRS 2185). In 2003, a band called The Staggers released a hard rock cover of the song. The song inspired the title of Kim Newman's novel The Bloody Red Baron (1995). The book features both the Red Baron and Snoopy, though the latter is deliberately unnamed in order to avoid copyright issues. The song is briefly featured towards the end of Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood.

Not to be confused with the Gorky Literary Institute, which is an institute of higher education that trains writers, the A. M. Gorky Institute of World Literature is a scientific research institute and part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It was founded on 17 September 1932 for the 40th anniversary of Maxim Gorky's literary activity, and is located in the former estate of the Gagarin family in Moscow. The Institute is organized into departments, each specializing in a specific region or genre of literature. These departments include, but are not limited to the Department of Literary Theory, Folklore, Old Slavic Literature, 19th Century Russian Literature, Contemporary Russian Literature and Russian Emigree Literature, Classical Western Literature and Comparative Literature, Literature of Asia and Africa, Contemporary European and American Literature, Literature of Russian Minorities and CIS Countries, and Manuscripts. There is also a department devoted to how Russian Literature is taught and disseminated abroad. The Institute is also home to personal archives of many writers, including Maxim Gorky and Andrei Platonov. In-house scholars devote themselves to publishing new works, and visiting scholars can also arrange to conduct research there, attend lectures, or speak about their work. The Gorky Institute was established in 1932 by decree of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union entitled, \\"On the events to mark the 40th Anniversary of the Literary Activity of Maxim Gorky.\\" The Institute was renamed from the Maxim Gorky Institute of Literature to the A. M. Gorky Institute of Literature in 1934 in accordance with another decree of the Presidium of the Central Committee, and Lev Kamenev was appointed as the first director. On 14 February 1937, the Gorky Archive and Gorky Museum were added on, the latter of which opened its doors to visitors on 1 November 1937. On 4 March 1938, they also opened the State Museum of Alexander Pushkin, which was later moved to Leningrad in 1949. On 16 April 1938, upon joining the Soviet (now Russian) Academy of Sciences, it received its current name. It is now located at the former estate of the Gagarins, which was built in the first quarter of the 19th Century by Italian architect Domenico Gilardi. In 1950, an employee of the Institute, became a Laureate for the first volume of a four-volume biography of Vissarion Belinsky. In 1952 Nechaeva was appointed as head of the Institute's Department of Texts.

The boat lift is part of the Waltrop Lock Park (Schleusenpark), which includes the old Henrichenburg boat lift built in 1899, a disused shaft lock from 1912, the new boat lift built in 1962 and a modern ship lock from 1989. The Henrichenburg boat lift is a popular destination for cyclists along the canals of the northern Ruhr Area. The old boat lift The old boat lift Night time view of the old boat lift in 2003 The old boat lift was opened in 1899. It was an important structure on the Dortmund-Ems-Kanal without which it would not have been possible to navigate to Dortmund Port. The lift was the biggest and most spectacular structure on the old Dortmund-Ems-Kanal. It was inaugurated by Kaiser Wilhelm II on 11 August 1899. =Purpose= The lift was able to accommodate the then usual Boat on the Dortmund-Ems-Kanal, 67 metres long, 8.2 metres wide, with a draft of 2 metres and lift it through a height of 14 metres to the level of the Dortmund Port. It could accommodate vessels of up to 350 tonnes. A complete descent or lift cycle, including entry and exit, took about 45 minutes. The actual lowering/lifting only took two and a half minutes. This was much faster than possible using ordinary locks. This method of raising boats also conserved water at the upper elevation which relied entirely on water pumped from the lower elevation for its supply. =Technology= This technically very interesting construction managed to lift approximately 1000 tonnes of ship and water filled trough using a relatively small amount of power. The trough was supported by 5 cylindrical floats each immersed in 40 metre deep water-filled wells. The lift from the floats was the same as the load of the water filled trough therefore, only a small electric motor sufficient to overcome friction and viscous resistance was needed to set the trough in motion in either direction. Four steel worm gears, 20 metres long and 280 mm in diameter were used to direct the trough in the appropriate course. The old lift was closed shortly after the opening of the new lift. A year later in 1963 an attempt was made to restart the old lift. It was found that the trough had tilted and that it could no longer be moved into either the fully up or fully down positions. The lift remains in this condition today and is conserved as part of a museum. =Museum= After the closure of the old lift it was decided in 1979 to develop the lift as part of the Westphalian industrial museum. The lift was restored and reconstructed without bringing it back into use. The lower dock of the old lift is used as a marina. The old lift has an iron framework construction with five float chambers. The trough and the upper and lower control towers are accessible. In the former boiler and machine house, machines, models and pictures can be seen. In the lower dock are the former police and fireboat Cerberus of 1930 and the motorvessel Franz-Christian of 1929 with an exhibition of working life on board in the cargo hold. In the 400m long canal adjoining the upper dock there is a collection of historical ships and a loading dock along with other exhibits. The Westphalian Industrial Museum is on the Dortmund-Ems-Kanal cycle route, the Emscher-Way. The new boat lift The new boat lift The new boat lift was opened in 1962 and has a trough length of 90 metres, a width of 12 metres, and a draft of 3 metres. It was capable of lifting vessels of up to 1350 tonnes. This lift utilizes the same construction principles as the old lift but using only two floats in two float chambers. The new lift soon became too small for the navigation's requirements and a new ship lock allowing boats 190 metres long and 12 metres wide, allowing a 4-metre displaced depth was built next to the lift in 1989. The new lift was taken out of use in December 2005 because of technical problems. The lift may not be repaired on the grounds of cost and the decreased usage of Dortmund Port. Problems or maintenance requirements on the modern lock would, without the lift, bring about the closure of Dortmund Port.

She was burned at the stake for attempting to commit arson. The story (see below) became the subject of joruri plays. The year of her birth is sometimes given as 1666.  Biography  In December 1682, she fell in love with Ikuta Sh≈çnosuke (or Saemon), a temple page, during the great fire in the Tenna Era, at Sh≈çsen-in, the family temple (danna-dera). The next year she attempted arson, thinking she could meet him again if another fire occurred. She was caught by the police and burnt at the stake in Suzugamori for her crimes. The magistrate at her trial, though knowing she was sixteen years old, asked her, ‚ÄùYou must be fifteen years old, aren't you?‚Äù At the time, boys and girls under the age of sixteen were not subject to the death penalty, and since strict family registration systems were not yet widely implemented, confirmation of age by a bureaucrat was sufficient. Misunderstanding the magistrate's intentions to try her as a minor, she replied that she was sixteen. At a loss, the magistrate asked her firmly again, ‚ÄùYou must be fifteen years old, are you not?‚Äù Not taking the hint again, she honestly stated her age as sixteen, leaving the magistrate no alternative but to sentence her to burn at the stake.

Irino, Kawase, Miki. Lancet 2007; 370:2126 Novels Memorial to Oshichi at Enj≈ç-ji in Tokyo Three years later, Ihara Saikaku described this case in the book K≈çshoku Gonin Onna (English translation, Five Women Who Loved Love). Twenty years after Yaoya Oshichi's death, a playwright, Ki no Kaion, took great liberties with the story to create a play for the traditional puppet theater entitled Yaoya Ohichi. In 1773, three playwrights (Suga Sensuke, Matsuda Wakichi, and Wakatake Fuemi further revised Ki no Kaion's play to produce Date musume koi no higanoko. In these two versions, Oshichi does not commit arson, instead she climbs a fire tower on a snowy night to ring the alarm bell to open the city gates in order to save the life of her lover, whom she cannot otherwise reach because of the nightly curfew. The penalty, however, for sounding a false fire alarm is death, a fate Oshichi chooses to face. In the puppet plays, the character of Oshichi is presented not as the seemingly impetuous, foolish girl of the historical record, but instead as a noble figure whose selfless devotion saves the man she loves. Later playwrights developed Oshichi's story for the stage: Tamenaga Tarobei in Junshoku Edo Murasaki, and Tsuruya Nanboku in Katakiuchi Yagura daiko.

Background Owned and bred by the Esmond family, she was raced under the name of Miss Diana Esmond. She was trained by Frank Carter, a member of the prominent racing family that began in France with Thomas Carter (1805-1879), who immigrated from Peckleton, Leicestershire in England in 1831 and founded the English Racing Colony in Chantilly, Oise. Pearl Cap is described by France Galop as being \\"light-framed\\" and \\"lop-eared.\\" On the race track, she won races from 1100 metres to 2400 metres. (0.68 to 1.5 miles). Racing career Racing at age two in 1930, Pearl Cap won five races, including victories over colts in the Prix Robert Papin as well as in the prestigious (now Group One), Prix Morny. Her performances that year earned her France's champion two-year-old filly honors. In her three-year-old season, the filly again beat her male counterparts in major races. She finished second to Prince Rose in the Grand International d'Ostende at Hippodrome Wellington in Ostend, Belgium, a race her sire Le Capucin won in 1924. After winning three Group One (today) races in France, including the Prix de Diane, in October Pearl Cap defeated Prince Rose at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris when she became the first filly to ever win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Breeding record Retired to broodmare duties, Pearl Cap was a disappointment as a broodmare until the age of sixteen, when she produced the 1947 Epsom Derby winner, Pearl Diver.  Pedigree  Pearl Cap was inbred 4 √ó 4 to St. Simon, meaning that St. Simon appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

Making a great contribution to British musical life, he wrote and lectured on his art, and enriched the field of musical competitions and examinations. He also wrote Where the Bright Waters Meet (1924) a classic book about fly fishing.  Training  Plunket Greene was born in Dublin, the son of Richard Jonas Greene, a barrister, and Louisa Lilias Plunket, granddaughter of William Conyngham Plunket, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He was educated at Clifton College\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p70: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 and initially expected to follow Law at Oxford. However, after he was 'smashed up' in a football accident he had a year's convalescence. Discovering his musical calling he studied under Arthur Barraclough in Dublin before attending the Stuttgart Conservatory for two years under Hromada in the early 1880s. He also studied in Florence with Luigi Vannuccini (a pupil of Francesco Lamperti), and in London with J. B. Welsh and Alfred Blume.Eaglefield-Hull 1924.  Early career  He made his debut in London (at the People's Palace, Mile End) in 1888, in Handel's Messiah, and in the next year appeared in Gounod's Redemption. In 1890 he made operatic debuts as Commendatore in Don Giovanni and as the Duke of Verona in Romeo et Juliette, at Covent Garden. Thereafter he elected to make his career in recital. In oratorio, his first Festival appearance was at Worcester in 1890. Plunket Greene created the title part in Parry's Job, at the Gloucester Festival in 1892. This includes the Lamentation of Job, an extremely long (28-page) and sustained oratorio scena. David Bispham said of his performances that he 'created the part and rendered it many times with superb dramatic feeling.'Bispham 1920, 159. In this, as in most of Parry's songs, Plunket Greene recognised the perfect declamation of Parry's writing, the accent upon word-values falling naturally and correctly in the music. As a result, he became the original exponent or dedicatee of many of the lyrical works of Parry, and also of Battison Haynes (\\"Off to Philadelphia\\"), and of Charles Villiers Stanford. Stanford wrote Songs of the Sea for him, and the singer also greatly admired Stanford's Cushendall and Irish Idyll cycles and the Three Cavalier Songs set to Browning's words. Although his voice was not exceptionally powerful he used it with great style, musicianship and intelligence. In 1891 George Bernard Shaw found him 'fairly equal to the occasion in the wonderful duet' from Bach's Whitsuntide Canatata, O, Ewiges Feuer, with the Bach Choir. In April 1892 (sharing the platform with Joseph Joachim and Franz Xaver Neruda, Fanny Davies, Alfredo Piatti and Agnes Zimmermann (piano)) he sang admirably in his first set (Jean-Baptiste Lully, Peter Cornelius and Robert Schumann) in a Monday Popular Concert, but made little of his second group. In November 1893 at the first of George Henschel's London Symphony Orchestra concerts for the season he performed Stanford's new song, \\"Prince Madoc's Farewell\\", so patriotically 'that he once or twice almost burst into the next key.' Shaw's strictures on his diction were no doubt taken very seriously by the singer, who studied to make absolute clarity and naturalness of diction a central point of his teaching and example.Shaw 1932, i, 107, 129; ii, 73, 89; iii, 86‚Äì88. From early in his career Plunket Greene became a champion of ballad and song in the English language, including traditional Irish and English song, into the concert repertoire. Through his connections with Stanford, Parry, Vaughan Williams, Gervase Elwes, and through the imitations or arrangements of Irish songs by Hamilton Harty, Arthur Somervell or Charles Wood he was very active in promoting this movement in English and Anglo-Irish art-song. He did this not by succumbing to the imitation of country singing, but by investing whatever he sang with all the principles of good singing - of long and intelligent phrasing, clean, natural attack and diction, lively faithfulness to rhythm and timing, and the powerful engagement of imagination in interpretation. These values were explained in his 1912 book Interpretation in Song which ran through many editions and rapidly became a classic. His advocacy of art-song was indefatigable. His early accompanist Henry Bird gained an appointment as accompanist to the Chappell Ballad Concerts after his very successful partnership with Plunket Greene in the Hungarian Songs of Francis Korbay.Harold Simpson, 'Ch. XI: Plunket Greene, and Stanford's Irish songs' in A Century of Ballads, 1810-1910 (Mills and Boon, London 1910), pp. 237-247.  Recitals ‚Äì partnership with Leonard Borwick  During the 1890s (from 1893) Plunket Greene became one of the foremost British performers and interpreters of the German Lieder, especially of Schubert, Schumann and Brahms. This he did in association with the English pianist Leonard Borwick (the brother of a schoolfriend), a Frankfurt pupil of Clara Schumann's noted for his powerful rhythmic delivery, and who (like his fellow-pupil Fanny Davies) was closely involved in the London work of Joseph Joachim. Plunket Greene and Borwick formed a musical friendship which lasted until Borwick's death. Plunket Greene was touring in America in spring 1893 and wrote to Borwick suggesting they should deliver a song and pianoforte recital in London, unlike the more usual form of miscellaneous concert with a mixed company. The first recital was in St James's Hall in December 1893, followed by a tour throughout the country, and this pattern was repeated for ten years. Borwick played his own programme as well as accompanying, but after a couple of seasons Samuel Liddle came in as accompanist. Pioneering this model of the recital, they gave a lead to that movement in London. Their rules were to maintain musicianship, avoid the glare of publicity, and never to take care of hands or voice. On 11 January 1895 at St James's Hall, Borwick and Greene gave the first complete public performance of Robert Schumann's Dichterliebe to be heard in London. Their musical partnership was still active in 1913, but the demands of their separate tours became so great by the early 1900s that they agreed not to continue their former recital programme unless it could be done whole-heartedly. Plunket Greene toured especially in the United States, where he considered the audiences especially attentive and appreciative, and in Germany. He also liked northern English audiences better than southern ones, and liked singing to audiences of public schoolboys.Plunket Greene 1934 (Blue Danube to Shannon), 74‚Äì89.  Gerontius and after  Plunket Greene was a friend of Edward Elgar's, and appeared in his Malvern Concert Club events.Young 1956, 126‚Äì127. He was the original baritone in the first (October 1900) performance (Birmingham Festival) of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, alongside Marie Brema (angel) and Edward Lloyd (soul), under Hans Richter. In June 1900 Elgar had written to August Jaeger, \\"he sings both bass bits and won't they suit him. Gosh.\\"Young 1956, 84. Although his recordings, and some commentators, suggest the voice was not a large one,e.g. Eaglefield-Hull 1924. it must have been capable of sustaining and projecting a considerable tone at this time, for both the Gerontius baritone solos require this. Moreover, for this most personal of his works, Elgar must have felt some real aptness in the choice. Arthur Somervell's song-cycle, on Tennyson's 'Maud' was originally produced (with twelve songs) in 1898 and was championed by Plunket Greene. In 1899 he married Gwendolen Maud, the youngest daughter of Hubert Parry, and their first son was born in 1901. He also gave the first performance of Arthur Somervell's A Shropshire Lad cycle, at the Aeolian Hall on 3 February 1904, and so had the distinction of being the first to sing settings of A. E. Housman's lyrics, which afterwards became so fundamental an inspiration to the composers associated with the English song revival of that period. Plunket Greene included a selection from the Songs of Travel by Ralph Vaughan Williams in recital in February 1905. Then (or soon afterwards) the composer heard him and dedicated the songs to him, and Greene afterwards quoted from them, and from Silent Noon (from the House of Life cycle), in his work on Interpretation in Song. Greene was responsible for establishing these songs in the English concert repertoire, where he was constantly attempting to raise the standard and quality of appreciation of English song through his programming.Rufus Hallmark, 'Robert Louis Stevenson, Ralph Vaughan Williams and their Songs of Travel,' in Brian Adams and Robin Wells (Eds.), Vaughan Williams Essays Vol 44 (Ashgate Publishing, 2003), pp. 135, 138. He supported Gervase Elwes from the start of his professional career and was his lifelong friend. At Elwes' audition for the Royal College of Music in 1903 Greene wrote to encourage him with the favourable reactions of Parry and Stanford,Elwes 1935, 127. and soon afterwards put him up for the Savile Club in London.Elwes 1935, 155. In 1906, he joined the party at Brigg to sing in the second festival there organised by Elwes and Percy Grainger, and declared his wish to be in many more of them.Elwes 1935, 165. When Elwes died in 1921, Greene wrote \\"I always felt he was the man I most looked up to.\\"Elwes 1935, 281‚Äì282. 'In the St Matthew Passion, (he) made us feel that he of all men was best fitted to tell us the greatest story in the world.'Elwes 1935, 296‚Äì297. Plunkett Greene's recordings were made first for the Gramophone Company, in 1904‚Äì1906. He included folk- songs in his recitals, according to them the same values of diction, phrasing, rhythm, and interpretative sincerity which he brought to art-songs. In later years, as he moved into the field of song-lecturing, he did great service to the cause of British folk-music. His last recordings were made by the electric process for Columbia Records: his late recording of 'Poor old horse' is an affecting example. On 24 January 1910 he appeared in the memorial concert at Queen's Hall for August Jaeger (Elgar's 'Nimrod'), singing a group of songs by Walford Davies, and Hans Sachs's monologue from Die Meistersinger.Elkin 1944, 41. He made his first appearance in Henry Wood's Promenade Concerts at the Queen's Hall in October 1914 singing Stanford's Songs of the Sea with the Alexandra Palace Choral Society.Wood 1946, 295: Elkin 1944, 70. He had declined to fulfil an engagement to sing them there for the Stock Exchange Orchestral Society in 1907 on hearing that they still used the high English Concert pitch.Elkin 1944, 104.  Competitions and festivals, teaching  In his later years Plunket Greene was busily involved in the organisation of music events and in teaching and administration. In 1923 he made his fifteenth voyage across the Atlantic (the first had been in 1893), on this occasion to act as a judge in Musical Competitions throughout Canada. From New York he went to Toronto by train to join Granville Bantock. This was to be at the five Festivals of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. This was the first Ontario Festival (Toronto) (with Robert Watkin-Mills and Boris Hambourg also in attendance), the 6th in Winnipeg (with Herbert Witherspoon and Cecil Forsyth assisting), where the Earl Grey trophy was competed for, the 16th in Edmonton (Alberta), with choirs from Lethbridge and Calgary, and in Prince Albert they were with Herbert Howells. The promotion and encouragement of these events provided not only a great spectacle and opportunity for music-making, but also infused a competitive spirit into the works of choirs, singers and instrumentalists in the award of prizes (in the tradition begun at Kendal, UK in c.1889), tending to the encouragement of excellence. Plunket Greene repeated the experience in Saskatchewan in 1931, together with Harold Samuel, Maurice Jacobson and Hugh Roberton.From Blue Danube to Shannon, Chapters II and VII. Among those to profit from his teaching was Sir Keith Falkner, whom Plunket Greene coached in his famous interpretation of the Lamentation of Job in Parry's oratorio Job.Brook 1958, 76. Personal life Plunkett Greene married Gwendolen Maud Parry, Hubert Parry‚Äôs younger daughter, in 1899. The couple had three children: Richard Plunket Greene (born 1901), David Plunket Greene (born 1904) and Olivia Plunket Greene (born 1907). The marriage was an unhappy one, however, and they separated in 1920. Plunket Greene died on 19 August 1936, aged 71. He was buried in the churchyard of Hurstbourne Priors, near the graves of his two sons. His grandson Alexander Plunkett Greene married fashion designer Mary Quant and had a son Orlando.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1939 to 1951 for the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Athletics, and Boston Red Sox. A five-time All-Star, Rosar was regarded as an excellent defensive catcher, setting a major league record for consecutive games without an error by a catcher. He is one of only three catchers in Major League history to catch at least 100 games in a single season without committing an error. Baseball career Rosar was first discovered in 1934 when he was chosen to play in an All-Star game for amateur baseball players from Buffalo, New York. The wife of New York Yankees manager, Joe McCarthy, attended the game and was so impressed with Rosar's catching ability that she told her husband about him. McCarthy sent Yankees' scout, Gene McCann to look at Rosar before the team signed him as an amateur free agent. He played for the 1937 Newark Bears team that won the International League pennant by 25¬Ω games to become known as one of the best minor league teams of all time. Rosar hit .387 with the Bears in 1938 to win the International League batting championship. Rosar made his major league debut with the Yankees on April 29, 1939 at the age of 24. From 1939 to 1942, he served as the Yankees' back up catcher to the future Hall of Fame inductee Bill Dickey. By the middle of the 1940 season, Rosar was out-hitting Dickey with a .343 batting average compared to Dickey's .226 average although, he appeared in only half as many games as, the Yankees were reluctant to relegate Dickey to second string status. On July 19, 1940, he hit for the cycle in a game against the Cleveland Indians. Rosar appeared in 73 games in 1940 and set career-highs with a .298 batting average and a .357 on-base percentage. In 1941, he hit well above .300 until the final month of the season before tapering off to end the year with a .287 average in 67 games as, the Yankees won the American League pennant by 17 games over the Boston Red Sox. Rosar made only one appearance in the 1941 World Series as a late-inning defensive replacement for Dickey in Game 2 as, the Yankees went on to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers in five games. Despite being a second string catcher, American League managers chose Rosar to be a reserve player in the 1942 All-Star Game over all other starting catchers in the league, with the exception of Birdie Tebbetts of the Detroit Tigers, who was selected to start the game. In July 1942, Rosar asked Yankees manager, Joe McCarthy, for permission to travel to Buffalo to take examinations to join the Buffalo police force and, to be with his wife who was about to have a baby. McCarthy refused to allow him to leave because Dickey was sidelined with an injury leaving only unseasoned rookie catcher Eddie Kearse available but, Rosar decided to leave without permission. When he returned to the club three days later, he found that McCarthy had replaced him with Rollie Hemsley and sent Kearse to the minor leagues, relegating Rosar to third-string catcher. Rosar had been seen as a successor to the aging Dickey but, after flouting the authority of the Yankees management, he would be traded to the Cleveland Indians by the end of the season. Although Indians manager, Lou Boudreau, named Gene Desautels as the Indians starting catcher at the beginning of the 1943 season, by the middle of the year Rosar was among the league leaders in hitting with a .313 average. He was recognised by being named to his second All-Star team as a reserve in the 1943 All-Star Game. He ended the season with a .283 batting average and 41 runs batted in. He also led American League catchers in assists and in baserunners caught stealing. In 1944, Rosar was assigned to a war job in Buffalo, New York before being transferred to another war job in Cleveland, leaving him available part-time to the Indians. He was again hitting among the league leaders with a .324 average in June before fading to finish the year with a .263 batting average. After two seasons with the Indians, Rosar refused to play at the beginning of the 1945 season because of a salary dispute. The Indians responded by trading Rosar to the Philadelphia Athletics for catcher Frankie Hayes on May 29, 1945. Rosar had one of his best seasons in the major leagues with Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics in 1946, hitting for a .283 batting average and posted career-highs with 120 hits and 48 runs batted in. He led American League catchers in assists, runners caught stealing, and fielding percentage, setting a record for errorless games by a catcher, posting a 1.000 fielding percentage in 117 games played as a catcher. The next year he extended his perfect play to 147 games and, was selected to be the starting catcher for the American League in the 1947 All-Star Game. The errorless games record has since been broken by several players. Rosar was hitting for just a .216 batting average by mid- season in 1948 however, his defensive reputation won him the fans' vote as the American League's starting catcher in the 1948 All-Star Game. During a three- season period between 1946 and 1948, Rosar committed only three errors. By 1949, Mike Guerra had taken over as the Athletics starting catcher and, Rosar would be traded to the Boston Red Sox in October 1949. With the Red Sox, he was the third string catcher behind Birdie Tebbetts and Matt Batts in 1950 and then to Les Moss in 1951 before being released in October 1951. Career statistics In a thirteen-year major league career, Rosar played in 988 games, with 836 hits for a .261 career batting average, along with 18 home runs and 367 runs batted in. Despite his relatively low offensive statistics, Rosar's defensive skills earned him a place on the American League All-Star team five times during his career. Rosar led all American League catchers in fielding percentage four years (1944, 1946‚Äì1948). He also led the league three times in assists, twice in baserunners caught stealing and once in caught stealing percentage. His 54.81% career caught stealing percentage ranks him third all-time behind only Roy Campanella and Gabby Hartnett. The gravesite of Buddy Rosar in Cheektowaga, New York Rosar caught two no hitter games in his career, pitched by Dick Fowler in 1945, and Bill McCahan in 1947. He has the best ratio of double plays to errors of any catcher in major league history. Rosar holds the 20th Century career record for fewest passed balls per games caught (0.0300) with only 28 miscues in 934 games as catcher. Rosar's .992 career fielding percentage was 10 points higher than the league average during his playing career, and at the time of his retirement in 1951, was the highest for a catcher in major league history. Later life After Rosar's baseball career, he was employed as an engineer at a Ford plant near his hometown of Buffalo. Rosar died on March 13, 1994, in Rochester, New York, while visiting the area.

The use of aeroplanes was not allowed, a self-imposed restriction. Steam liners don't exist any more, so all of the long sea journeys had to be on container ships or freighters. The one exception was the trip from Dubai to Mumbai (Bombay) on a dhow, a high point of the trip. This book, like the other books that Michael Palin wrote following each of his seven trips for the BBC, consists both of his text and of many photographs to illustrate the trip. Unlike the following books, in which the pictures were taken (almost) exclusively by Basil Pao, the pictures in this book are from many sources. (Basil Pao did provide the pictures for the Hong Kong to Shanghai stretch.) To some extent the book reads like a diary, as Michael Palin starts each section of the book with a heading like \\"Day 42 - Hong Kong\\". This reflects the fact that the whole trip was a kind of \\"race against time\\" effort, and being aware of how many days have passed and how many days are left before the magic number 80 arrives adds extra excitement. An interesting aspect of this trip is that almost 3/4 of the time (59 days) was spent getting around the first half of the globe (Europe, Middle East, Asia, Pacific to the International Date Line) and only 1/4 of the time (21 days) for the last half of the trip (rest of the Pacific, U.S.A., Atlantic). This is also reflected in the number of pages in this book: 180 for the first half of the trip, 60 for the last half. There are a couple of reasons for this discrepancy. Traveling across the Pacific and the Atlantic was done on fast modern container ships. The trip across the U.S.A. was done by train, which was fairly fast, and this stretch was presumably considered to be less interesting for Western TV viewers (the intended audience) than the more exotic parts in the Middle East and Asia. One major difference between this trip and the following Michael Palin trips for the BBC was the desire to follow a preordained route that involved a lot of time traveling at sea. Day after day of sailing does not make for very exciting TV. For example, in an almost grotesque sequence, Michael Palin arrives in Singapore harbor on one ship at midnight, rushes through immigration and departure processing, and embarks on the next ship at 2:45 a.m. Neither Palin nor the viewers get to see a single view of Singapore. The text of this book is available free to read online on Michael Palin's official web site.  Audio edition  This book was made available as an audio book, read by Michael Palin himself, allowing the listener to hear his wit and charm, and his ability to do accents. The audio book does not include the photographs, of course. The audio book is unabridged, and lasts 7 hours 35 minutes.

Areas marked here in red were given to Poland in 1920, green areas to Czechoslovakia. The Slovak invasion of Poland occurred during Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939. The recently created Slovak Republic joined the attack, and the Slovak Field Army Bernol√°k contributed over 50,000 soldiers in three divisions. As the main body of the Polish forces were engaged with the German armies farther north of the southern border, the Slovak invasion met only weak resistance and suffered minimal losses. Background March 14, 1939, saw the Slovak State established as a client state of Germany, initiating the breakup of Czechoslovakia. Before this, on November 2, 1938, the south-Slovak part of Czechoslovakia containing a substantial Hungarian population (the territory of Slovakia has been part of the Kingdom of Hungary) was taken by the Hungarian Army as a result of the First Vienna Award of November 2, 1938. The official political pretext for the Slovak participation in the Polish Campaign was a disagreement over a small disputed area on the Poland-Slovakia border. Poland had appropriated this area on December 1, 1938, in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of September 1938. In addition, some Polish politicians supported Hungary in their effort to include into their state parts inhabited mostly by Hungarians. During secret discussions with the Germans on July 20‚Äì21, 1939, the Slovak government agreed to participate in Germany's planned attack on Poland. The Slovaks also agreed to allow Germany to use its territory as the staging area for its troops. On August 26, the Slovak Republic mobilized its armed forces and established a new field army, codenamed \\"Bernol√°k\\", which comprised 51,306 soldiers. Additionally, 160,000 reservists were called up, with 115,000 entering service until September 20, 1939. Order of battle The Bernol√°k army group was led by the Slovak Minister of Defense Ferdinand ƒåatlo≈°, and had its initial headquarters in Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves, though after September 8 this was moved to Solivar near Pre≈°ov. It consisted of: * 1st infantry division \\"J√°no≈°√≠k\\" led by Anton Pulanich in sector Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves ‚Äì Pre≈°ov. * 2nd infantry division \\"≈†kult√©ty\\" led by Alexander ƒåunderl√≠k in sector Brezno ‚Äì Poprad. * 3rd infantry division \\"R√°zus\\" led by August√≠n Mal√°r in sector east of High Tatra. * A motorized unit \\"Kalinƒçiak\\" was created on September 5 but the campaign ended before it arrived on the front. The group was part of the German Army Group South and was subordinated to the 14th Army led by Wilhelm List, contributing to the 14th Army's total of five infantry divisions, three mountain divisions, two panzer divisions and one Luftwaffe division. Bernol√°k's task was to prevent a Polish incursion into Slovakia and to support German troops. Their opposition was the Polish Karpaty Army (Carpathian Army), which consisted of mainly of infantry units with some light artillery support and no tanks. Campaign The attack started without a formal declaration of war on September 1, 1939, at 5:00 a.m. The 1st division occupied the village of Javorina and the town of Zakopane, then continued toward Nowy Targ, protecting the German 2nd Mountain Division from the left.S.J. Zaloga: Poland 1939, Oxford: Osprey Publishing Ltd., 2002. . During September 4‚Äì5, it engaged in fighting with regular Polish Army units. On September 7 the division stopped its advance, 30 km inside Polish territory. Later, the division was pulled back, with one battalion remaining until September 29 to occupy Zakopane, Jurg√≥w and Javorina. The 2nd division was kept in reserve and participated only in mopping-up operations. In this it was supported by the Kalinƒçiak group. The 3rd division had to protect 170 km of the Slovak border between Star√° ƒΩubov≈àa and the border with Hungary. It fought minor skirmishes, and after several days moved into Polish territory, ending its advance on September 11. Two or three Slovak air squadrons (codenamed ƒΩalia, Lily) were used for reconnaissance, bombing and close support for German fighters. Two planes were lost (one to anti-aircraft fire, one to an accidental crash), and one Polish plane was shot down. Total Slovak losses during the campaign were 37 dead, 114 wounded and 11 missing. Aftermath All Slovak units were pulled back until the end of September 1939. On October 5, a victorious military parade was held in Poprad. The mobilized units were gradually demobilized and the Army Group Bernol√°k was disbanded on October 7. The Slovak Army took around 1,350 civilian prisoners in Poland. In February 1940, around 1,200 of these were handed to Germans, and some of the remainder to the Soviets. The rest were kept in a Slovak prison camp in Le≈°≈•. All the disputed territory, whether part of Poland from 1920 or from 1938, was given to Slovakia (this was confirmed by a Slovak parliamentary resolution on December 22, 1939). This arrangement lasted until 20 May 1945, when the border line was returned to its 1920 position. Since the war was started without a formal declaration of war and since there were no longer any Polish prisoners of war held by Slovakia there was no formal peace treaty between Poland and Slovakia.

It is maintained by the UK Forestry Commission. Dalby Forest, along with Langdale Forest and Cropton Forest, forms part of the North Riding Forest Park, found within the North York Moors National Park. Fauna and flora Dalby Forest is home to many species of wildlife such as badgers, roe deer and nightjars. There are also many species of trees including oak, beech, ash, alder and hazel. History There is evidence of people living in Dalby Forest since the Bronze Age. Burial mounds, linear earthworks of unknown purpose and the remains of a flourishing rabbit warrening industry have also been found throughout the woods. During the 1930s, unemployed men were set to work in Dalby Forest, breaking ground, building tracks and undertaking other heavy labour. The men lived in a work camp at Low Dalby, which was one of a number of so-called Instructional Centres run by the Ministry of Labour in order to 'harden' young men who had been out of work for some time. By 1938, the Ministry was operating 35 Instructional Centres across Britain with a total capacity of over 6,000 places. By 1939, unemployment was declining in the face of impending war and the Ministry closed down its work camps. However, much of Dalby village seems to be based partly on the layout of the old Instructional Centre. In 1982, Barry Prudom sought refuge from a police manhunt in Dalby Forest. Prudom who was wanted for several murders holed up in Malton near the police station and when cornered, he committed suicide. Recreation Today, Dalby Forest is used for recreation as well as timber production. There are several car parks, hiking trails and mountain bike trails, a 'forest drive' throughout the forest and a Go Ape centre. A toll is charged to enter either end of the forest drive by car. There is no further charge for parking at the car parks along the route. The main visitor centre has a caf√© and shop, which is adjacent to a selection of other businesses including a bike shop and various craft workshops. A free, weekly, timed 5k parkrun takes place at 9am every Saturday starting near The Courtyard, Low Dalby. Mountain bike trails correspond to the standard IMBA and Forestry Commission grading scheme. Some start from the main visitor centre, others from Dixons Hollow, an area a little further along the forest drive. They include: * Two green trails, one starting from the visitor centre and one from Dixons Hollow. The green trails follow forestry roads for the duration of the trail, and as suggested by the IMBA, require a minimal amount of fitness and are suitable for families. * A blue trail starting from the visitor centre. * A red trail starting from Dixons Hollow. This is the longest trail and explores much of the forest. It passes nearby the visitor centre and can be accessed from it. The red trail is technical in places and requires a high level of fitness and technical proficiency. A hardtail mountain bike of a moderate spec is advised to tackle this trail. * A black trail starting from Dixons Hollow. The black trail is highly technical with some extremely severe descents requiring a very high level of skill and fitness. Please be advised that on the newer sections of the trail there are a number of blind 3‚Äì5 ft drops which can cause serious injury if approached unaware, or at a high speed. * A \\"slope-style\\" area at Dixons Hollow, including jumps, a corkscrew, northshore and skinnies. This has been sponsored by Pace Cycles and constructed in association with SingletrAction. The trickier trails deliberately start from Dixons Hollow, a little remote from the main visitor centre, to discourage inexperienced mountain bikers. In 2010 and 2011 the forest hosted a round of the cross-country section of the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup. A climb through the forest featured on the first stage of the 2015 Tour de Yorkshire. The route of The White Rose Way, a long distance walk from Leeds to Scarborough passes through the forest. Dalby has long been a popular venue for rallying, its forest tracks, noted for their long straights and difficult bends, for many years was one of the most daunting stages on Britain's round of the World Rally Championship, the RAC Rally.

It was devised by Jody Thompson and Cali Ressler, who originally proposed the strategy at Best Buy and have since started a consulting group called CultureRx. The strategy has subsequently been implemented at a second large American retailer, Gap., as well as the Girl Scouts of San Gorgino, J.A. Counter and Associates, and the Fairview Health Services I.T. Department., The Garabian Group, the first ROWE accounting firm, ROWE tries to give managers the tools to define goals which can be clearly met or unmet by the results of individual contributors working for that manager. This focus on met or unmet results aims to allow the organization to focus on fewer minute details of employee daily routine.  ROWE Companies  The increase in popularity of ROWE strategy can be seen in the number of companies implementing it. Recently, companies and agencies like GAP Inc., 97th Floor, Yum! Brands, SpinWeb now Mojo Media Labs, Reserve Advisors Inc., Dixie iron Works, Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio Council, Minnesota Department of Transportation and American Society of Clinical Oncology have been experimenting with ROWE. Additionally, Sweden has recently brought up the 6-hour a day work strategy in hope of increasing employee productivity. Experts suggest that this is a great step towards ROWE and also helps curb the consequences of Presenteeism. Best Buy, once the biggest advocate of ROWE, has abandoned it. Its CEO Hubert Joly said, \\"Depending on the skill and will of the individual, the right leadership style may be coaching, motivating or directing rather than delegating\\".http://www.startribune.com/best-buy-ceo-on-leadership-a-comment-i- made-was-misconstrued/198546011/. ROWE is all about delegating to the employee and hoping that she will deliver. As Hubert Joly said \\"If you delegate to me the job of building a brick wall, you will be disappointed in the result!\\". ROWE creators, Jody Thompson and Cali Ressler, claim that many leaders misunderstand the true meaning of a ROWE; ROWE is not a management delegation program. Instead, they claim it is pure management innovation. According to them, each person in the organization is 100% accountable and 100% autonomous meaning that each employee understands what their measurable results are. They state that managers manage the work, not the people. Performance conversations are ongoing and teams are highly collaborative. Within ROWE everyone should be focused on the customer, say ROWE creators. \\"Bottom line? No results, no job.\\" Managers become Results Coaches, and evolve into highly motivated individuals who create a culture of competence, not complacency, treating everyone as the adults they are. Fundamentals there are 4 fundamentals for ROWE to be successful: # employees must understand what their role is in the company. # employees must understand what they are responsible for # employees must understand what the measurement for success is # employees must understand the repercussions of failing to meet the set measurement of success  See also  *Coworking *Flextime *Hot desking *Telecommuting *Presenteeism *Piece work  References  Category:Human resource management ","title":"ROWE"},{"id":"11554500","text":"The Fremantle Team of Legends was selected to recognise legends of Australian rules football in Fremantle, Western Australia.Full Team  Selection criteria  The main selection criteria for players selected in the team was that they must have played 100 games for either of the Fremantle-based WAFA/WAFL/WANFL clubs.

Upon Coleman's return, federal agents in Atlanta, Georgia arrested Coleman. On Thursday September 11, 1997, Coleman pleaded guilty to the five counts of perjury and signed a public apology.

These two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as \\"mesoscale and microscale meteorology\\" (MMM) and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale; that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a weather map. These include small and generally fleeting cloud \\"puffs\\" and other small cloud features. Microscale meteorology controls the most important mixing and dilution processes in the atmosphere. Important topics in microscale meteorology include heat transfer and gas exchange between soil, vegetation, and/or surface water and the atmosphere caused by near-ground turbulence. Measuring these transport processes involves use of micrometeorological (or flux) towers. Variables often measured or derived include net radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, ground heat storage, and fluxes of trace gases important to the atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere. A micronet is an atmospheric and/or environmental observation network, composed of automated weather stations, used to monitor microscale phenomena. Micronets are sometimes considered a subtype of mesonet, and many micronets are a denser spatial resolution sub-network of a mesonet.

P. Herbert for Punch magazine as part of his series of Misleading Cases in the Common Law. It was first published in book form in More Misleading Cases in the Common Law (Methuen, 1930).A.P. Herbert's Misleading Cases The case evolved into an urban legend. Summary of the case The case involved a Mr Albert Haddock, often an ingenious litigant in Herbert's writing. In this case, Haddock had been in disagreement with the Collector of Taxes over the size of his tax bill. Haddock complained that the sum was excessive, particularly in view of the inadequate consideration he believed that he received from that Government in service. Eventually the Collector demanded ¬£57 and 10 shillings. Haddock appeared at the offices of the Collector of Taxes and delivered a white cow \\"of malevolent aspect\\". On the cow was stencilled in red ink: Haddock tendered the cow in payment of his bill and demanded a receipt. During the hearing, the fictitious judge, Sir Basil String, enquired whether stamp duty had been paid. The prosecutor, Sir Joshua Hoot KC confirmed that a two-penny stamp was affixed to the dexter horn of the cow. The collector declined the cow, objecting that it would be impossible to pay it into a bank account. Haddock suggested that he endorse the cow to a third party to whom he might owe money, adding that \\"there must be many persons in that position\\". Sir Joshua informed the court that the collector did try to endorse the cheque on its back, in this case on the abdomen. However, Sir Joshua explained: \\"[t]he cow ... appeared to resent endorsement and adopted a menacing posture.\\" The collector abandoned the attempt and declined to take the cheque. Haddock led the cow away and was arrested in Trafalgar Square for causing an obstruction, leading to the co- joined criminal case, R v Haddock. He testified that he had tendered a cheque in payment of income tax. A cheque was only an order to a bank to pay money to the person in possession of the cheque or a person named on the cheque, and there was nothing in law to say it must be on paper of specified dimensions. A cheque, he argued, could be written on notepaper. He said he had \\"drawn cheques on the backs of menus, on napkins, on handkerchiefs, on the labels of wine bottles; all these cheques had been duly honoured by his bank and passed through the Bankers' Clearing House\\". He thought that there was no distinction in law between a cheque on a napkin and a cheque on a cow. When asked as to motive, he said he had not a piece of paper to hand. Horses and other animals used to be seen frequently in the streets of London. He admitted on cross- examination that he may have had in his mind an idea to ridicule the taxman. \\"But why not? There is no law against ridiculing the income tax.\\" In relation to the criminal prosecution, Haddock said it was a nice thing if in the heart of the commercial capital of the world a man could not convey a negotiable instrument down the street without being arrested. If a disturbance was caused by a crowd, the policeman should arrest the crowd, not him. The judge, sympathetic to Haddock, found in his favour on the tax claim and prosecution for causing a disturbance. By tendering and being refused the cow, the other parties were estopped from then demanding it later. Television adaptation Board of Inland Revenue v. Haddock was dramatised for BBC television as \\"The Negotiable Cow\\" as the opening of the first series of A. P. Herbert's Misleading Cases in 1967, with Roy Dotrice as Albert Haddock and Alastair Sim as Mr Justice Swallow. Citations Although the case is fictitious, it has been referred to in judicial decisions. In Messing v Bank of America (2002) at paragraph 1373 Md. 672; 821 A.2d. 22 the Maryland Court of Appeals observed: \\"The circumstances which gave rise to the case before us are, in terms of its genesis, reminiscent of those described in the case of Board of Inland Revenue v. Haddock.\\" In the English case of Mr Justice Lightman stated that a document, in the context of the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981, \\"must be inanimate: neither a person nor A. P. Herbert's 'negotiable cow' can constitute a document.\\"At paragraph 11. Herbert reported that the now defunct Memphis Press-Scimitar (formerly published by the E. W. Scripps Company) published an article on the case in 1967, assuming it to have been factual. Comparable real life cases Negotiable instruments and other legal documents have been written on unusual surfaces. Documented cases provide illustrations of wills on the side of empty egg-shells,See Hodson v Barnes (1926) 43 TLR 71. The will was rejected from probate. and cheques being written on a variety of strange surfaces.A commonly cited example is tax protests in the United Kingdom in the 1970s when taxpayers would print their cheques on rigid boards measuring approximately 3 feet by 1¬Ω feet. An often- cited example is a Canadian farmer who, while trapped under his own tractor, carved a holographic will into the tractor's fender. The fender was probated and stood as his will, and is currently on display at the law library of the University of Saskatchewan College of Law.On Campus News, January 23, 2009: The Last Will and Testament of Cecil George Harris In Jewish law a get can be written on any durable material, including the horn of a cow. If the horn is still attached to the cow, the husband must give the wife the whole cow.Mishnah Gittin 2.3,. See also BT Eruvin 15a-b. Similar fictional cases Another A. P. Herbert \\"misleading case\\" concerns \\"The egg of exchange\\". The question there was whether a cheque written on an egg could be paid into a bank, given the risk of the egg breaking or going bad. It was suggested that the cheque could be boiled. Yet another \\"misleading case\\", also Inland Revenue v Haddock, was cited in a debate in the House of Lords on 14 July 2004. In this, Mr. Haddock successfully argued that, during a period when judges had their salaries reduced by 30% because of financial emergency, they could not hear cases relating to the Inland Revenue because they had a personal interest in the outcome.

He was one of the most important military figures who rejoined the Free French forces in 1940. He was awarded the Ordre de la Lib√©ration. Larminat joined the French Army at the outbreak of the First World War as a private and by 1915 had completed his officer training and later fought at the Battle of Verdun. During the course of the war, Larminat was wounded three times and gassed once. He achieved the rank of captain by the close of the war. Completing his military studies at Saint-Cyr in October 1919, Larminat volunteered to serve in the colonial infantry. In this capacity, he saw combat against rebels in Morocco, and later served in Mauritania and Indochina. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Larminat was a lieutenant-colonel stationed in the Levant. Larminat was still serving in the Middle East when France surrendered in June, 1940. He refused to comply and was imprisoned in Damascus, but escaped and fled to join Free French forces in Palestine. He was later active in Africa and during the liberation of Italy and France, serving as the commander of the 1st Free French Division in north Africa, the French Pursuit Corps in Italy, and the French II Corps and Atlantic Army Detachment in France. De Larminat led the controversial bombardment of the city of Royan in April 1945.The Zinn reader: writings on disobedience and democracy Howard Zinn p.275ff and in French, . After the war, Larminat served in several positions, notably as the Inspector-General of overseas troops and the inspector of colonial forces. He also served as the first president of the Association of the Free French. Larminat retired to the reserves in 1956 and was briefly recalled to active duty in 1962 to chair the Court of Military Justice charged with judging the actions of French officers who took part in the rebellion of colonial troops in Algeria in 1961. Before the court convened, Larminat committed suicide on 1 July 1962.

Although only a tower, the height of the bluffs on which it stands makes it the third highest light off the water in the bay. It is also known for the large number of women who served as lightkeeper: four of the ten known keepers, serving 89 of the 115 years the light was staffed. Turkey Point Light in 1995, after the house was torn down. Turkey Point Light, March 2007 History Congress appropriated $5,000 for this light in early 1833, which was built by John Donahoo and completed in July 1833. He followed essentially the same plan as he had used for Concord Point Light. Acquisition of the land was delayed somewhat by a controversy over valuation. The light originally used eleven wicks and reflectors, but in 1855 a fourth order Fresnel lens with a single lamp was substituted, with the lantern upgraded in 1867 to fit the new lens better. The lighting arrangements were upgraded several times over the years, with electrification coming in 1942. Its automation in 1947 brought about the retirement of Fannie Salter, the last woman lighthouse keeper in the United States. Along with the tower, Donahoo built a keeper's house. Originally a single story, it was raised to two stories in 1889. The site also housed an unusual fog bell enclosure, built in 1888. Due to the height of the bluff, it was decided to put the bell as low to the ground as possible. To accommodate the weights for the ringing mechanism, a thirty-foot well was dug and the enclosure placed over them. During World War II a watchtower was placed atop the bell enclosure. After automation, the tower's remote site made it a target for vandalism. An incident in which the tower was broken into and the lens stolen brought about the removal of a large section of the wooden spiral staircase and the sealing of the entry with a steel door. The keeper's house decayed and was torn down in 1972. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 2002 as Turkey Point Light Station. In 2000 the light was decommissioned and leased to Turkey Point Light Station (TPLS) Inc., a non-profit organization which has taken over maintenance of the structure; the group reactivated the light as a private aid to navigation in 2002. The group additionally replaced the steel ladder in the lighthouse with a new wooden spiral staircase. On weekends volunteers give tours of the lighthouse including a walk to the top.Elk Neck State Park staff In 2006, the Coast Guard transferred ownership to the state of Maryland, which then renewed the lease to TPLS. The land around the station is today part of Elk Neck State Park. To see how other locals lived on the water and land, visit the Upper Bay Museum in the North East Community Park.

The tortoise was believed to be extinct in the mid-20th century, until Hungarian malacologist J√≥zsef V√°gv√∂lgyi spotted Lonesome George on the Galapagos island of Pinta on 1 December 1971. Since then, Lonesome George has been a powerful symbol for conservation efforts in general and for the Galapagos Islands in particular. With his death on 24 June 2012, the subspecies is again believed to be extinct. With the discovery of 17 hybrid Pinta tortoises located at nearby Wolf Volcano a plan has been made to attempt to breed the subspecies back into a pure state. Not all EW species are rare. An example is the Brugmansia family, where all seven species are widely cultivated but none are found in the wild. Ultimately, the purpose of preserving biodiversity is to maintain ecological function, so when a species exists only in captivity, it is ecologically extinct. Reintroduction Reintroduction is the deliberate release of species into the wild, from captivity or relocated from other areas where the species survives. This may be an option for certain species that are endangered or extinct in the wild. However, it may be difficult to reintroduce EW species into the wild, even if their natural habitats were restored, because survival techniques, which are often passed from parents to offspring during parenting, may be lost. While conservation efforts may preserve some of the genetics of a species, the species may never fully recover due to the loss of the natural memetics of the species. An example of a successful reintroduction of an EW species is Przewalski's horse, which as of 2018 is considered to be an endangered species, following reintroduction started in the 1990s.

A leading translator of Russian texts into English under the Soviet regime, Navrozov emigrated to the United States in 1972, where he published a best-selling memoir, The Education of Lev Navrozov, and became a prominent Russian dissident.Thought, Fordham University Press, ISSN 0040-6457 , p.140 Biography =Early life= Navrozov was born to playwright Andrei Navrozov (after whom his son was named), a founding member of the Soviet Writers' Union, who volunteered in World War II and was killed in action in 1941. After completing the course at Moscow Power Engineering Institute, did not take the degree, switching to the exclusive Referent Faculty of the Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages, a faculty created by Joseph Stalin's personal order to produce a new generation of experts with a superior knowledge of Western languages and cultures. On graduation in 1953 was offered a \\"promising position\\" at the Soviet Embassy in London, with the attendant obligation to join the Communist Party. Declined both offers, and thenceforth refused all government posts or academic affiliations as a matter of principle. Regarded as a unique expert on the English-speaking countries, but only ever worked as a freelance. =Position as translator= Navrozov was the first, and to date the last, inhabitant of Russia to translate for publication works of literature from his native tongue into a foreign language, including those by Dostoevsky, Hertzen and Prishvin, as well as philosophy and fundamental science in 72 fields.On Navrozov's uniqueness as a translator, see John Updike's introduction to Mikhail Prishvin's Nature's Diary, translated by Lev Navrozov ; New York : Penguin Books, 1987. . In 1965, still freelance but now exploiting what amounted to his virtual monopoly over English translations for publication,Native Russian speakers born and bred in Russia translated into Russian for publication in Russia, while native English speakers, resident in Russia, translated into English for publication in the West. Navrozov, as the catalogues of Moscow's Foreign Languages Publishing House confirm, was the sole exception. acquired a country house in Vnukovo, sixteen miles from Moscow, in a privileged settlement where such Soviet nabobs as Andrei Gromyko, then Foreign Minister, and former Politburo member Panteleimon Ponomarenko had their country houses. =Dissident historian= In 1953 he began his clandestine documented study of the history of the Soviet regime, working on a cycle of books in the hope of smuggling the manuscript abroad. During this period he published translations only, publishing no original work in view of the unacceptable limits imposed by censorship. In 1972 he emigrated to the United States with wife and son, after receiving a special invitation from the U.S. State Department arranged through the intercession of several politically influential American friends. During 1972-1980 he contributed articles to Commentary, including the scandalous 1978 publication of the articles \\"What the CIA Knows About Russia,\\" which Admiral Stansfield Turner publicly admitted he was unable to rebut,Harrison, Mark : Accounting for War: Soviet Production, Employment, and the Defence Burden 1940-1945 ; Cambridge Russian, Soviet and Post Soviet Studies ; Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 2002. .\\"Navrozov versus the Agency\\" in Wiles, Peter, ed., The Soviet Economy on the Brink of Reform : essays in honor of Alec Nove ; Boston : Allen & Unwin, 1988. . and \\"Notes on American Innocence,\\" which resulted in an unsuccessful $3 million action for defamation brought against the author by the former Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir.See \\"Statement by Elmer J. Winter, President, American Jewish Committee,\\" Commentary, February, 1976. =The Education of Lev Navrozov= In 1975, Harper & Row published the first volume of his study of the Soviet regime from within, The Education of Lev Navrozov. The book recounts the contemporary effects of Joseph Stalin's public relations campaign in the aftermath of the assassination of rival Sergei Kirov. \\"It bids fair to take its place beside the works of Laurence Sterne and Henry Adams,\\" wrote the American philosopher Sidney Hook,For the Hook review of Navrozov, see Cotter, Matthew J.: Sidney Hook Reconsidered ; Amherst NY : Prometheus Books, 2004. . \\"‚Ä¶ but it is far richer in scope and more gripping in content.\\" Eugene Lyons, author of the pioneering 1937 work Assignment in Utopia, described the book as \\"uniquely revealing,\\" while Robert Massie, author of Nicholas and Alexandra, wrote of the author's \\"individual genius.\\" Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning novelist, responded to The Education by using Navrozov as the model for a modern Russian dissident thinker in two of his books, thereby beginning a lively correspondence that continued until the American novelist's death. In particular, the narrator of More Die of Heartbreak describes Navrozov, along with Sinyavsky, Vladimir Maximov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, as one of his epoch's \\"commanding figures\\" and \\"men of genius.\\"Bellow, Saul : More Die of Heartbreak ; London : Secker & Warburg first world edition, 1987. . In Bellow's non-fictional account To Jerusalem and Back, Navrozov is referred to in the same vein, this time by the author. =Later life= After 1975, Navrozov published several thousand magazine articles and newspaper columns, which, however diverse the subjects drawing his attention and commentary, have a common theme, namely the incapacity of the West to survive in the present era of increasingly sophisticated totalitarianism. He was the founder, in 1979, of the Center for the Survival of Western Democracies, a non-profit educational organisation whose original Advisory Board brought together Saul Bellow, Malcolm Muggeridge, Dr. Edward Teller, Lt. Gen. Daniel O. Graham, the Hon. Clare Boothe Luce, Mihajlo Mihajlov, Sen. Jesse Helms, and Eug√®ne Ionesco.Source: CSWD letterheads, statement of purpose, and certificate of incorporation as a 501(c)(3) not for profit educational organization. The name was later changed to \\"Center for the Survival of Western Democracies.\\" See the Lifeboat Foundation biographies current listing at lifeboat.com for Lev Navrozov, and an early reference to the organization in \\"The Record\\" (No. 59, February 1979) of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. =Later work= Navrozov was concerned with the possibility that China is developing deadly weapons based on nanotechnology; and the need for the United States to counter this threat with its own nanoweapon research. He often cites Eric Drexler as the inspiration for this interest. As early as 2003, Canadian science writer George Dvorsky, chairman of the board of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, noted that \\"Lev Navrozov, the Russian weapons expert who believes that China will eventually try to take over the world using nanoweapons, is declaring K. Eric Drexler to be the Einstein of nanotechnology. Specifically, Navrozov is comparing Einstein's famous warning to President Roosevelt about the viability of atomic weapons to Drexler's 1986 book, Engines of Creation, where he warns about the possibility of the development of nanoweapons. Navrozov is concerned, however, that Drexler is not being taken seriously by the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), an organization that Navrozov compares to the Manhattan Project. But as Navrozov notes, the irony in all this is that the NNI has denied the military aspects of nanotechnology. 'Imagine,' says Navrozov, 'the U.S. Manhattan Project policy of tacit denial of the military importance of nuclear power, the implication being that the Manhattan Project, with all the money allocated for it, should concentrate on the development of nuclear power as fuel.' Disturbingly, while the Chinese have been startlingly open about the potential military uses of molecular assemblers, Navrozov notes that 'the current government-NNI policy completely excludes research involved in molecular nano assemblers because of the false non-feasibility argument as put forward by Richard Smalley with peremptory categorical zeal.' Ultimately, as the debate between Drexler and Smalley rages, Navrozov sees no harm in assuming that Drexler is right, that we should err on the side of caution. 'Now, let us conjecture, for the sake of argument, the opposite,' argues Navrozov, 'What would be the danger? That the West, including Dr. Smalley and his carbon nanotubes, would be reduced to dust or would surrender unconditionally to become a vast Hong Kong.'\\" He died on 22 January 2017 at the age of 88.Emigre columnist Lev Navrozov, 88, sought to awaken American minds Lev Navrozov, Russian dissident ‚Äì obituary Lev Navrozov, Literary Translator and Soviet Dissident, Dies at 88\\" by Richard Sandomir, The New York Times, February 9, 2017: Notes External links * Weekly column at NewsMax.com * Columns by Lev Navrozov at WorldTribune.com * Biography at the Lifeboat Foundation * Interview with Navrozov at Worldthreats.com Category:1928 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Soviet dissidents Category:Soviet emigrants to the United States Category:Soviet historians Category:20th-century historians Category:Soviet writers ","title":"Lev Navrozov"},{"id":"11554674","text":"Edna Lockwood, a surviving bugeye. The bugeye is a type of sailboat developed in the Chesapeake Bay for oyster dredging. The predecessor of the skipjack, it was superseded by the latter as oyster harvests dropped.  Origins  Between 1820 and 1865, the state of Maryland banned the practice of dredging for oysters. In the latter year, the law was relaxed; the use of steam power remained banned, however, and remained entirely prohibited until 1965, in which year powered dredging was allowed two days of the week. As long as dredging for oysters in the Chesapeake was prohibited, oystermen working from log canoes tonged for oysters. In 1854 the Maryland legislature permitted the use of dredges in the waters of Somerset County, Maryland, expanding the use of dredges to the rest of the Bay following the Civil War. Opening the Chesapeake to oyster dredging after the Civil War created a need for larger, more powerful boats to haul dredges across the oyster beds. The first vessels used were the existing sloops, pungys and schooners on the Bay, but none of these types was well suited to the purpose; pungys and schooners were too deep in their draft to work the shallower waters of the Bay, the schooners and sloops had bulwarks too high to facilitate handling the dredges, the relatively complex rigs of all three types required uneconomically large crews of skilled sailors, and the vessels themselves were relatively expensive to build and maintain. The log canoes had none of these disadvantages, but were too small to successfully haul dredges. The result was the development during the 1870s and 1880s of the brogan, an enlarged log canoe. In Kepner, Charles H. The Edna E. Lockwood (St. Michaels, MD: Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, 1979)Brewington, M.V. Chesapeake Bay Bugeyes (Newport News, VA: The Mariners' Museum, 1941) brogans, the open hull of the log canoe was decked, with hatches covering holds created by subdividing the hull with bulkheads. Brogans typically used the same sail plan as the log canoes of the Tilghman Island region, a leg-of-mutton (i.e., triangular) foresail, mainsail and jib, with the foremast taller than the main. Both masts raked rather sharply aft, with the mainmast raked significantly more sharply than the foremast.1 Brogans were still too small to effectively haul dredges, and continued to be enlarged and improved. By the early 1880s, or possibly even earlier, the first bugeyes were being built.2 Over the next twenty years, the bugeye became the dominant type of vessel employed in oystering, but by 1893 construction of new bugeyes began to decline with the introduction of the skipjack, which was less expensive to build, operate and maintain yet was very well suited to dredging for oysters. No working bugeyes appear to have been built after 1918, but bugeyes continued to be employed in oystering and freighting until the middle of the Twentieth Century, albeit in ever-decreasing numbers.3 The origin of the name is obscure.  Design  Like the earlier brogan, the typical bugeye, designed by William Reeves who was originally from Nova Scotia, was two-masted, with triangular ‚Äúleg-of-mutton‚Äù mainsail, foresail and jib. By modern standards, this rig would be described as a ketch rig, but it appears that watermen of the time referred to it as simply a leg-of-mutton or a bugeye rig. Unlike modern ketches, the forward-most mast was referred to as the foremast and the after mast was termed the mainmast, although like the brogan and log canoe, the mainmast was shorter than the foremast. As with the earlier brogans and the log canoes, the masts were sharply raked, although they were set up with stays and shrouds. Unlike the brogan, however, the mainmast was raked only slightly more sharply than the foremast.4 A bowsprit with trailboards was inevitably used. The hull was beamy and shallow, with no chine. Initially it was chunked from logs, in the manner of the log canoe; eventually conventional framed construction was introduced as the supply of suitable trees was depleted. The usual form was double-ended, with a sharp stern, and most such boats had a heavy beam called the \\"duck tail\\" projecting a short distance from the stern in order to protect the rudder. To increase deck space a \\"patent stern\\" was installed after 1893; it consisted of a set of three beams: one across the duck tail, and two joining its ends to either side of the boat. The ostensible purpose, according to the patent in question, was to provide a mounting spot for davits for a dinghy; the whole area, however, could be planked over to provide a considerable increase in deck space. All log bugeyes were sharp-sterned, but some frame versions had round sterns; a very few had a square transom. The freeboard was invariably low, the better to lift the dredges onto the deck. Due to the wide, flat bottom, a centerboard was provided. Early boats used a tiller for steering, but as patent steering gear became available, the wheel came into use instead. Besides the raked, paired masts, the other distinctive feature of the bugeye is the mounting of the bowsprit. This was mounted between paired hawsepieces and knightheads, and terminated in a large vertical post called the \\"samson post\\", upon which the anchor windlass was also typically mounted. The hawsepieces projected above the deck and, with the prominent hawseholes, are thought possibly to be the origin of the name \\"bugeye\\". In the center of the ship sat the windlass (generally called the \\"winder\\") for the dredge lines. Early winders were simple hand-cranked spools, eventually equipped with devices to prevent injuries when the dredge caught on an obstruction. As gas and diesel engines became available they replaced the hand-cranked winder. In either case a pair of rollers was mounted at the rail on either side, to protect the hull from rubbing and to reduce friction as the dredges were raised. By and large there was very little development within the type, other than the minor improvements already listed. There was a small trend towards increasing size; bugeyes averaged around in length, but some later examples were well over long. Variations in the sail plan were tried, particularly with additional jibs, gaff rigging and staysails. A few were built with a single mast, resulting in a boat with a superficial resemblance to the skipjack.  Operation  Oystering was performed in the winter (the \\"R months\\" of September through April); in the summer the boats were used in light freight work where it was available. For oystering the boat would be taken out to the bed, and the dredge would be dropped as a pass was made at speed over the bed. At the end of the run the dredge would be lifted onto the deck and the live oysters separated from the dead shells and other debris. This process would be repeated until sufficient oysters were obtained. More enterprising captains would then sail the boat directly to the markets in Baltimore, Crisfield, and other towns where the oysters were bought at wholesale and processed. Alternatively, the catch could be sold to a buy boat, which acted as a middle man in the process. Some boats both dredged and acted as buy boats, in which case a bushel basket would be mounted on the fore mast to indicate the latter. With its low freeboard, the bugeye was not generally considered to be an ocean-going vessel; some boats were however sailed to the West Indies in the off season for the tropical trade. One bugeye, the Brown Smith Jones, was built for the Maryland Oyster Police. It had the distinction of being commissioned in the United States Navy in World War I, taking the name USS Dorchester in this service.  Decline of the type  Construction of bugeyes closely paralleled the oyster harvest, which peaked in 1884. As the catch declined, the skipjack became more popular, as it was smaller and cheaper to build. Bugeye construction dropped to almost nothing shortly after the turn of the century. Many of the survivors gave up dredging and devoted themselves to the buy boat business, in which case the sails were no longer wanted. In a typical conversion the bowsprit and main mast were removed entirely, and the fore mast shortened and modified into a derrick for hoisting. A stern cabin for the wheel and an engine for power completed the transformation. (The William B. Tennison is a surviving example of such a conversion.) from the Maryland Historic Trust website As a result of such conversions, and simple attrition, surviving bugeyes are extremely rare, and only one (the Edna E. Lockwood) survives in its original form.National Historic Landmark Study from the US National Park Service website The plan was however taken up as a pleasure craft, and new versions for that purpose continue to be built. Edna E. Lockwood on display at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum  Surviving example  One of the best examples of the type still in existence is the Edna E. Lockwood, which is on exhibit at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in Saint Michaels, Maryland. The Lockwood is a nine log bugeye launched on October 5, 1889 at Tilghman Island, Maryland, by John B. Harrison for Daniel Haddaway, at a cost of $2,200. She worked for at least seven sets of owners from 1899 until 1967, and was then sailed as a yacht until donated to the museum in 1973. The museum undertook an extensive restoration of the Lockwood from 1975 through 1979, which restored the bugeye to its 1910 appearance with the \\"patent stern\\" that had been added sometime prior to that year. She is the last bugeye retaining the sailing rig and working appearance of the type, and is a National Historic Landmark. Her length is 53 ft-6 in, with a 15 ft-3 in beam and a 2 ft-7 in draft with the centerboard up, and a maximum sail area of approximately . Legacy In the novelette Angelfish, Lester Dent described the fictional Sail in great detail: \\"The bugeye Sail was a Chesapeake Bay five-log, thirty-four-feet waterline. She looked to have been built last week, she was sixty-eight years old. Her beam was twelve feet, she drew two feet with the centerboard up.\\"Lester Dent (1936), Angelfish, Black Mask, December 1936, in Herbert Ruhm (1977), ed., The Hard Boiled Detective: Stories from \\"Black Mask\\" Magazine (1920-1951), New York: Vintage, p. 171, . Sail is one of the principal characters described, second only to her owner, also named \\"Sail.\\" Dent owned a bugeye, Albatross, in the mid-1930s.

She wrote a memoir of her father, titled My Dad, the Babe. Childhood Dorothy was born June 7, 1921 in New York City at St. Vincent's Hospital to Juanita Jennings, and was adopted by Babe and Helen Ruth. It is documented that Dorothy was raised to believe that Helen was her biological mother. It is speculated that Helen did not know that Dorothy was the result of an extramarital affair between Babe and his girlfriend Jennings. It is possible that when Babe Ruth learned of his mistress' pregnancy, he convinced Helen, unaware that Babe was the father, to adopt the baby girl. Babe Ruth also somehow convinced Dorothy's biological mother to allow him to adopt their daughter, so that she could be raised with him and (a possibly unsuspecting) Helen. Helen and Babe Ruth separated some time between 1924 and 1926. Babe and Helen Ruth did not divorce because of their religious beliefs. Dorothy lived with her adoptive mother Helen after the separation. In January 1929, when she was 7 years old, her mother died in a house fire. After Helen's death, Dorothy lived with her father and Claire Merritt Ruth, whom he married in April 1929. She had one step-sister as Babe had adopted Claire's daughter Julia. Dorothy learned at the age of 59 in 1980 that Juanita Jennings Ellias was her biological mother. Dorothy had known Juanita growing up, but only as a friend of her father.

Dorothy later married Dominick Pirone in New York City on December 8, 1948.

The Land grant to Marduk- apla-iddina kudurru is a grey limestone 0.7-meter tall ancient Mesopotamian nar√ª or entitlement stele recording the gift of four tracts of cultivated land with settlements totaling 84 GUR 160 qa by Kassite king of Babylon, Meli-≈†ipak (ca. 1186‚Äì1172 BC ), to a person described as his servant (arassu irƒ´m: ‚Äúhe granted his servant‚Äù) named Marduk-apla-iddina, who may be his son and/or successor or alternatively another homonymous individual. The large size of the grant together with the generous freedom from all territorial obligations (taxation, corv√©e, draft, foraging) has led historians to assume he was the prince. There are thirty six kudurrus which are placed on the basis of art- history to Meli-≈†ipak's reign, of which eight are specifically identified by his name. This is the best preserved of all of them. The stele The kudurru was recovered in 1899 from Susa, excavation reference Sb 22, by the French archaeological expedition under the auspices of Jacques de Morgan and brought to the Mus√©e du Louvre where it still resides. The object is inscribed on three sides in seven columns and 387 lines. Like most kudurrus, it portrays Mesopotamian gods graphically in segmented registers on the stone. In this case the divine icons number twenty-four in five registers, rather more than usual. The bequest was for communal land of the city of Agade located around the settlement of Tamakku adjacent to the royal canal in Bƒ´t-Piri‚Äô-Amurru, a province in northern Babylonia. In a passage granting exemptions from service and taxation to the residents of the transferred territory, a list of officials are forbidden from appropriating the land and levying labor with restrictions placed on their conduct. This includes the king himself, the ≈°akin mƒÅti (the governor of the land), and the pƒ´·∏´ƒÅtu (rank uncertain) of Bƒ´t- Piri‚Äô-Amurru, contradicting the image of oriental despotism sometimes portrayed concerning the period. The text concludes with an unusual series of blessings and curses including a rather gruesome curse of Gula, ‚Äúmay she place in his body her oozing (sores), a persistent carbuncle, of no release, so that, for as long as he lives, he may bathe in blood and pus like water!‚Äù, which seems to have been reproduced on the Stele of Meli-≈†ipak.

Formation and touring In January 2001 deSoL was officially formed. Located in Asbury Park, the band was able to start touring extensively on the east coast, working their trade. Their early years spent touring earned them a record deal they signed with Curb Records. deSoL quickly became a main stay in large tours as a supporting act, including an opening slot for REM at the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City. deSoL supported many acts including Blues Traveler, Los Lonely Boys, Ozomatli, Cypress Hill, Arrested Development and Widespread Panic. In 2005, deSoL toured extensively with the Legendary Wailers, playing to sold-out venues six nights a week for four months.

Music of the genre is created primarily through remixing and reworking songs from popular music and music from the eighties. While there is a large amount of famous music used in tecno brega, the majority of it is original material (80%). Several DJs and music producers from the tecno brega movement were featured in the peer-to-peer filesharing documentary Good Copy Bad Copy. Good Copy Bad Copy. Production and distribution The music is created by producers in makeshift studios, whether in bedrooms or other unused spaces. Rather than being sold in a traditional CD format, techno brega is characterized by new distribution methods. Rather than selling a CD in a store, tecno brega CDs are sold for a minimal price (averaging US$1.50) by street vendors, who often make the actual CDs themselves. Often producing their music with little concern for copyright, the music is \\"born free\\". The street vendor is then in charge of making more copies and using the CDs as advertisements. These advertisements are for large reggae sound systems style parties, very similar to a rave. It is at these concerts that producers will make money, whether by entrance fees or by selling CDs produced that night from live music. Sound system parties The sound systems themselves become a competitive point, encouraging producers to have the most up to date electronic equipment. They may attract as many as 12,000‚Äì15, 000 people to a show. With typical attendance, they may sell an average of 77 CDs and 53 DVDs after a performance. At these shows a performer may also do \\"shout outs\\" to friends, family, or neighborhoods, making the CDs more valuable to the audience. Shout outs can also be bought by pre-purchasing a CD of the concert prior to the beginning of the show. A performance can earn the performer on average R$2,200 (approx. US$1250 as of March 2012) a show.

Most commercial DVD movies include Content Scrambling System (CSS), a copy-protection technology designed to prevent DVD movies from being copied. This controversial DVD copy software program included technology that decrypts the CSS copy protection mechanism on DVD movie discs. DVD X Copy products are still being sold on the DVD X Copy website, although it was previously believed to be no longer sold or supported. This DVD copy software program was created by 321 Studios. The DVDXCopy product line included DVD X Copy, DVD X Copy Xpress, DVD X Copy Gold and DVD X Copy Platinum. DVD X Copy Xpress enabled consumers to make a perfect \\"1Click DVD copy\\" of any DVD movie in under 30 minutes. The product upgrade path to the premium priced DVD X Copy Platinum provided advanced features that give users increased control over the DVD backup process. The highly popular DVD X Copy line of products were sold through major North American and International retailers and online via the official website. Legal battle Anticipating a lawsuit by the major Hollywood motion picture studios, in April 2002, 321 Studios filed a pre-emptive complaint against eight Hollywood studios contending that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a law that prohibits the circumvention of copy protection technology, violates consumer rights as provided in the Fair Use doctrine of the Copyright Act of 1976. The Fair Use doctrine provides individuals with limited rights to copy certain forms of copyrighted material. The complaint named MGM Studios, Tristar Pictures, Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Time Warner Entertainment, Disney Enterprises, Inc., Universal City Studios, The Saul Zaentz Company and Pixar as defendants. In May 2003 seven of the Hollywood studios including MGM Studios, Tristar Pictures, Columbia Pictures, Time Warner Entertainment, Disney, Universal City Studios and The Saul Zaentz Company countersued 321 Studios by filing a series of claims alleging that the DVD X Copy products violated the DMCA. On February 23, 2004, Judge Susan Illston of the Northern District Federal Court for California ruled that 321 Studios' products violated copyright law and ordered an injunction that prohibited the sale of DVD X Copy products in the United States within seven days of the injunction. 321 Studios proceeded to remove all products from the US retail channel and from the http://www.dvdxcopy.com website. The ruling caused 321 Studios to shut down with the company finally ceasing operations in August 2004.

In Sanskrit, the word J√±ƒÅna means knowledge, and Vigraham is the common term for statue (or embodiment). The name J√±ƒÅna Vigraham signifies embodiment of knowledge. The first such statue was carved in wood and portrays facial likeness to NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru. The overall iconography incorporates aesthetic design elements, Sanskrit words of reverence, and symbolic depiction of the Guru's spiritual reform initiative, concepts of human equality and knowledge universe arivu. The aesthetic elements of the design of a J√±ƒÅna Vigraham conform to ancient Eastern philosophic and religious iconography and carvings commonly seen across Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The first J√±ƒÅna Vigraham The first J√±ƒÅna Vigraham was designed and commissioned by a private art collector and researcher of NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru's philosophy and teachings. It was primarily intended as a trendsetter to improve the quality of NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru's statues, kept in homes and in small chapel-like places of reverence and worship called 'Guru Mandirams'. These shrines dot the length and breadth of Kerala, the south-western part of India where NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru was born and lived during the period 1856 to 1928. The J√±ƒÅna Vigraham was sculptured in wood by the sculptor Artist Mani Mesthiri of Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, during 2006-2007. The work signified the period commemorating one and a half centuries since the Guru's birth, as well as the 75th anniversary of the annual pilgrimage to Sivagiri, the chosen spiritual abode and eternal resting place of saint NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru. Design elements The design of J√±ƒÅna Vigraham incorporates three parts of its structure - the anatomical statue, the pedestal and the radiance board (Prabha). =The anatomical statue= The core anatomical statue is devoid of any decorative elements. It is a lifelike figure of NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru, supposedly in his mid-life, in a seated posture and with hands in the ‚Äòdharmachakra mudra‚Äô, the gesture of teaching usually interpreted as turning the wheel of righteousness. The hands are held level with the heart, the thumbs and index fingers form circles, symbolising the teachings of the NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru. The legs are placed in ‚ÄòvajrƒÅsana‚Äô an iconographic yoga posture (also referred to as ‚Äòpadmasana‚Äô), symbolising that Narayana Guru had mastered various yoga practices and endorsed Raja Yoga, which is yoga of meditation and also incorporates Hatha Yoga. =The pedestal= The pedestal has three front- facing panels with relief carvings. The centre panel depicts the conch and lotus, the traditional Eastern symbol of dharma. One of the side panels illustrate the historic consecration of the Sivalinga in 1888 at Aruvippuram; an action of NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru that broke the centuries-old tradition of such spiritual practices that was reserved as a prerogative of orthodox priests of those days. The third panel depicts the eastern proverbial blind men and an elephant as represented by NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru in verse 44 of the Guru's philosophical masterpiece and scripture Atmopadesa Satakam (one hundred verses of self-instruction). =The radiance board= The radiance board providing the backdrop and halo for the statue incorporates decorative elements and symbolism. The overall structure of the backdrop displays likeness to the Sarnath Buddha. The lower portion of the board figures the relief carvings of two elephants in outward facing and welcoming posture signifying NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru's openness to the views and beliefs of other religions and philosophies. The radiance board also has relief carvings of fluttering birds representing the Guru's words in verse 8 of the scripture Atmopadesa Satakam. The six fluttering birds represent the five senses and the sixth sense of philosophical intuition as visualised by the designers to venerate the Guru. The relief carvings of the birds are intertwined with creepers and flowers signifying the growth and fruition of wisdom. =Words of reverence= The J√±ƒÅna Vigraham incorporates the citation of a befitting Sanskrit verse from the ancient Indian scripture Bhagavata Purana to revere NƒÅrƒÅyana Guru as follows: > eke tvƒÅkhila-karmƒÅni > sannyasyopa≈õama·∏ø gatƒÅ·∏• > j√±ƒÅnino j√±ƒÅna-yaj√±ena > yajanti j√±ƒÅna-vigraham Translation: In pursuit of spiritual knowledge, some persons renounce all material activities and, having thus become peaceful, perform the sacrifice of philosophic investigation to worship You, the embodiment of knowledge.

It is designed to coordinate science and technology policy across the branches of federal government. History The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) was established by President Bill Clinton through Executive Order 12881 on November 23, 1993. Because its mission is to coordinate scientific research and policies, and further the president's policy agenda, its membership includes the heads of many scientific agencies and departments. During the Clinton administration, the NSTC wrote 6 Presidential Review Directives, used for President Clinton's own future directives, but the council has not issued any of these since. Instead, the council's recommendations often serve as advice for other committees as policy is drafted, and members of the science and technology community have debated whether the NSTC should play a more direct role in policymaking. The structure of the NSTC has changed multiple times in the last few decades. Under the Obama Administration, the Council's subcommittees were restructured and a new committee for directing STEM education was added. Then the NSTC gained another subcommittee under the Trump Administration, as well as special committees on artificial intelligence and research environments. Mission A primary objective of the NSTC is the establishment of clear national goals for federal science and technology investments in virtually all the mission areas of the executive branch. The Council prepares research and development strategies that are coordinated across federal agencies to form investment packages aimed at accomplishing multiple national goals. While a fundamental mission of the NSTC is to further the President's scientific policies, it also has been charged by Congress to coordinate activities in a number of federal projects. These include combating ocean acidification, overseeing the National Nanotechnology Program, and supporting STEM education. However, the six committees and two special committees of the NSTC direct the present efforts of the agency to the topics they cover.  Structure  The NSTC is chaired by the President and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The rest of its membership is made up of the Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries and Agency Heads with significant science and technology responsibilities, and other White House officials and advisors where necessary. In the past, NSTC staff have ranged from 5 to 21 members. Member agencies contribute funding to the projects that the NSTC oversees, and from 2010 to 2018 their contributions ranged from $12 million to $18 million per year. These funds go towards multi-agency projects, and the rest of the funding comes from agency contributions to their own projects or the OSTP. At present, the work of the NSTC is organized under six primary committees; Science, Technology, Environment and Natural Resources and Homeland, STEM Education, Science and Technology Enterprise and National Security. Each of these committees oversees subcommittees and working groups focused on different aspects of science and technology and working to coordinate across the federal government.

Biography He was educated at Saint-Cyr, graduating 1873, and after that was posted to Madagascar. Following that he was a professor at the Ecole de Guerre. He was promoted to colonel in 1901, rising to divisional commander four years later and appointed to the French Supreme War Council in 1913. Ruffey was an apostle of aircraft and heavy artillery.Tuchman 1962, p261 Ruffey, like Lanrezac (and Gallieni before World War I) warned of the danger of a German thrust westward through Belgium. French Commander-in-Chief Joseph Joffre, who planned to attack into the Ardennes, bluntly told him ‚Äúyou are wrong‚Äù.Tuchman 1962, p182 Ruffey was given command of the Third Army at the outbreak of war and charged with attacking along the line from Montmedy to Rocroi.Doughty 2005, p65 Third Army consisted of IV, V and VI Corps, the 7th Cavalry Division and a group of three reserve divisions.Greenhalgh 2014, p.27 His army came under heavy German pressure from mid-August, suffering a defeat at the Battle of the Ardennes, a part of the Battle of the Frontiers.

His army was forced to retreat to Verdun after heavy fighting; Joffre found Ruffey ‚Äúvery nervous‚Äù and ‚Äúbitter‚Äù about the performance of his subordinates, and so dismissed him from command and replaced him by Maurice Sarrail.Doughty 2005, p85 Ruffey blamed his defeat on the holding back of two reserve divisions to the Army of Lorraine (40,000 men). He later told Joffre that if he had these two divisions and the 7th Cavalry Division, he could have rolled up the enemy‚Äôs left ‚Äì Joffre replied ‚Äúchut, il ne faut pas le dire‚Äù (\\"one musn't say that\\") ‚Äì it is unclear whether or not Joffre agreed with Ruffey.Tuchman 1962, p376 Ruffey held no other active commands during the war and died in 1928.

(1976), \\"Sopite Syndrome - Sometioes Sole Manifestation of Motion Sickness\\", Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine, 47(8), pp. 873-882. The sopite syndrome has been attributed to motion-induced drowsiness such as that experienced by a baby when rocked.Lawson, B. D., & Mead, A. M. (1998). The sopite syndrome revisited: Drowsiness and mood changes during real or apparent motion. Acta Astronautica, 43(3-6), 181-192. Researchers Graybiel and Knepton at the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory first used the term \\"the sopite syndrome\\", in 1976, to refer to the sometimes sole manifestation of motion sickness, though other researchers have referred to it as \\"Sopite syndrome.\\" Signs and symptoms Several symptoms are associated with the sopite syndrome. Typical responses include: *drowsiness *yawning *disinclination for work *lack of social participation *mood changes *apathy *sleep disturbances *other fatigue-related symptoms The sopite syndrome is distinguished from other manifestations of motion sickness (i.e. nausea, dizziness, etc.) in that it may occur before other symptoms of motion sickness or in their absence. The sopite syndrome may persist even after an individual has adapted to the other symptoms associated with motion-induced sickness. =Severity= The effects of the sopite syndrome may range from minor physical inconveniences to hazardous conditions. People who operate automobiles, airplanes, etc., may experience impaired motor function due to the motions of the vehicle. These impairments often result in a decreased attention span; those who consider themselves well-rested may still succumb to drowsiness at inopportune moments. The sopite syndrome may therefore contribute to motor vehicle accidents in which automobile operators fall asleep at the wheel. However, the sopite syndrome itself does not directly result in death.Kennedy, R. S. (5 October 2010). (A. V. Paschall, Interviewer) A subject experiencing the sopite syndrome on a frequent basis may increase the number of hours spent sleeping by fifty percent. A study of motion sickness occurrences in workers on an offshore oil vessel showed a large majority of participants experienced mild symptoms of fatigue. Many participants also experienced severe sleep disturbances. These symptoms were associated with impaired task performance.Haward, B. M., Lewis, C. H., & Griffin, M. J. (2009). Motions and crew responses on an offshore oil production and storage vessel. Applied Ergonomics, 40(5), 904-914. Causes The sopite syndrome has been associated with visually-induced and vestibular motion sickness. Other factors associated with drowsiness such as darkness or physical fatigue may intensify the effects of motion-induced sleepiness. The sopite syndrome may occur with little motional stimulus (though the greatest effects tend to be observed in subjects who have been exposed for longer periods of time), and often persists for a time after the motional stimulus has ceased. =Susceptibility= A study of certain aspects of motion sickness among medical transport attendants showed that the onset of the sopite syndrome is likely to occur independently of the mode of transportation; little difference was observed in the frequency of sopite symptoms for ground transport compared to air transport. Also, the length of time exposed to vehicular motion did not appear to affect the occurrence (or lack thereof) or severity of the sopite syndrome. No difference was observed in the incidence of the sopite syndrome for men versus women.Wright, M. S., Bose, C. L., & Stiles, A. D. (1995). The incidence and effects of motion sickness among medical attendants during transport. Journal of Emergency Medicine, 13(1), 15-20. The sopite syndrome is likely a cumulative disorder. For instance, when a subject has the flu, a hangover may exacerbate the symptoms of the illness. A subject normally resistant to motion sickness may experience symptoms of motion sickness when also experiencing flu-like (or hangover-like) symptoms. Mechanism The exact mechanism for the induction of the sopite syndrome is still unknown; however, a leading theory asserts that the sopite syndrome (and perhaps motion sickness in general) is somehow related to the reticular formation, an area of the brainstem associated with arousal. A study of motion-induced effects on the P50 potential (a measure of arousal) showed that subjects exposed to motion environments experience decreased sensory gating, which involves the filtering of information in the brain.Dornhoffer, J. L., Mamiya, N., Bray, P., Skinner, R. D., & Garcia-Rill, E. (2002). Effects of rotation on the sleep state- dependent midlatency auditory evoked P50 potential in the human. Journal of Vestibular Research-Equilibrium & Orientation, 12(5-6), 205-209. In the case of Space Motion Sickness, the unweighting of otolith organs can lead to a sensory mismatch between the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems. Motion studies in which the subjects lacked vestibular systems did not experience symptoms of the sopite syndrome or other manifestations of motion sickness. =Vestibular system= The role of the vestibular system in the inducement of the sopite syndrome or related symptoms may be difficult to ascertain. Researchers must compare the results of test subjects experiencing a motion environment to a control environment lacking motion. Experimental subjects who suffered increased fatigue in a rotating environment apparently recovered from this side effect when the same environment ceased motion. In similar studies, control subjects lacking vestibular function did not experience the motion-induced drowsiness associated with the sopite syndrome, while subjects with normal-functioning vestibular systems did experience increased fatigue in the rotating environments. =Visual stimulus= The relation of the visual-vestibular stimulus to the sopite syndrome may be observed when comparing airline cockpit crew with cabin crew. While the former typically experience more confined conditions, the airline cabin crew tend to experience more symptoms associated with sopite syndrome; this effect may be attributed to the lack of visual validation and increased movement of the cabin crew. =Biochemicals= Certain hormones or biochemicals likely affect the pathways associated with motion sickness in general and the sopite syndrome in particular. Studies reported by Kennedy, Drexler and Kennedy (2010) have investigated the role of cortisol and melatonin (a hormone associated with the maintenance of circadian rhythms) in motion-induced drowsiness. Subjects were exposed to vection-producing environments (virtual reality, for example) and symptoms were evaluated using a Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. Sopite symptoms were also measured using a developed scale. The levels of endogenous cortisol and melatonin were then compared with levels before the subjects were tested in the vection environments. Most subjects showed increased levels of endogenous cortisol and melatonin post-vection. Melatonin may therefore be involved in the drowsy state associated with the sopite syndrome.Kennedy, R. S., Drexler, J., & Kennedy, R. C. (2010). Research in visually induced motion sickness. Applied Ergonomics, 41(4), 494-503. =Noradrenergic pathways= The inhibition of noradrenergic pathways has also been associated with symptoms of the sopite syndrome. Studies have shown that animals exposed to motion environments commonly exhibit drowsiness and disinclination for activity. These animals show slowed electroencephalography waves, which are involved in the firing of neurons in the brain. The locus coeruleuses of these animals are apparently deactivated.Nishiike, S., Takeda, N., Kubo, T., & Nakamura, S. (2001). Noradrenergic pathways involved in the development of vertigo and dizziness - A review. Acta Oto-Laryngologica, 61-64. The sopite syndrome is therefore linked to inhibition of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic pathways. As such, noradrenaline releasers may be useful in counteracting these symptoms. Diagnosis =Classification= The sopite syndrome is classified as a symptom-complex centered on drowsiness. It may be distinguished from ordinary fatigue. Researchers have previously studied this effect through the use of rotating rooms. When subjects who had previously shown minimal susceptibility to general motion sickness and fatigue (in this particular case, four military officers) were recruited to live in a rotating room for several days, they exhibited several signs of drowsiness, such as yawning and frequent napping. Despite numerous activities designed to promote awareness and excitability, the subjects showed decreased motivation to socialize or perform physical activities. Many of these symptoms could be attributed to the vestibular stimulation of the rotating rooms. Management Many drugs taken to relieve typical symptoms of motion sickness (including nausea, dizziness, etc.) contain compounds that may exacerbate drowsiness. Antihistamines are commonly used to treat motion sickness; however, side effects include drowsiness and impaired cognitive abilities. Anticholinergics such as scopolamine have also proved effective against motion sickness, but may induce drowsiness.Hoyt, R. E., Lawson, B. D., McGee, H. A., Strompolis, M. L., & McClellan, M. A. (2009). Modafinil as a Potential Motion Sickness Countermeasure. Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine, 80(8), 709-715. These treatments may be combined with stimulants to counteract typical motion- induced nausea and dizziness while also preventing sedation. However, many stimulants possess addictive properties, which result in a high potential for substance abuse. Some stimulants also tend to interfere with normal sleep patterns. Modafinil has been studied as a possible treatment for the sopite syndrome that does not appear to have the same side effects of normal stimulants. Modafinil appears to be effective when taken in combination with anticholinergics such as scopolamine, but studies of Modafinil-only treatments for motion sickness remain inconclusive. Research  The sopite syndrome may be difficult to test due to the nature of the symptoms. Indicators such as drowsiness, mood changes, and apathy must be observed and graded objectively. Therefore, many of the results obtained from studies of the sopite syndrome are not sufficiently repeatable for the purposes of scientific writing. =Questionnaires= A typical method for determining the effects of the sopite syndrome is through the use of one or several questionnaires. The available questionnaires for motion sickness and sopite syndrome are described by Lawson.Lawson, B. D. (2014). Motion sickness scaling. In K. S. Hale & K. M. Stanney (Eds.), Handbook for Virtual Environments: Design, Implementation, and Application (2 ed., pp. 601-626). Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press. Two such questionnaires widely used to evaluate motion sickness are the Pensacola Diagnostic Index and the Motion Sickness Questionnaire. These questionnaires are limited, however, in that they group symptoms of drowsiness with other non-sopite related effects, such as nausea and dizziness.Gianaros, P. J., Muth, E. R., Mordkoff, J. T., Levine, M. X., & Stern, R. M. (2001). A questionnaire for the assessment of the multiple dimensions of motion sickness. Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine, 72(2), 115-119. Motion sickness is measured based on the cumulative ratings of all these symptoms without distinguishing different levels for each effect. A Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire has been developed to test the multiple dimensions of motion sickness more thoroughly; this survey defines motion sickness as gastrointestinal (involving nausea), peripheral (referring to thermoregulatory effects such as clamminess and sweating), central (involving symptoms such as dizziness and lightheadedness), and sopite-related. This questionnaire may more accurately determine how subjects experience sopite symptoms relative to other motion sickness effects. Another questionnaire designed to measure sleepiness is the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. =Optokinetic drum= An optokinetic drum may be used to study visually induced sopite effects. The optokinetic drum is a rotating instrument in which test subjects are seated facing the wall of the drum. The interior surface of the drum is normally striped; thus, as the drum rotates, the subject's eyes are subject to a moving visual field while the subject remains stationary. The speed of the drum and the duration of the test may be varied. Control groups are placed in a drum without stripes or rotation. After exposure to the rotating drum, subjects are surveyed to determine their susceptibility to motion sickness. A study in which the optokinetic drum was used to test the symptoms of the sopite syndrome showed increased mood changes in response to the visual cues, though these effects were compounded by other environmental factors such as boredom and lack of activity.Kiniorski, E. T., Weider, S. K., Finley, J. R., Fitzgerald, E. M., Howard, J. C., Di Nardo, P. A., et al. (2004). Sopite symptoms in the optokinetic drum.

He was a lesser-known but important contributor to nuclear science. Early life Lew Kowarski was born in Saint Petersburg to Nicholas Kowarski, a businessman and the Ukrainian singer Olga Vlassenko. Following the Bolshevik Revolution, when Lew was 12 years old, his family fled west under adventurous circumstances and settled in Vilnius (then in Poland). During his youth, Lew was a talented musician and considered a music career; however, his fingers grew too large for the keyboard. Education He received a Chemical Engineering degree from the University of Lyon and an Sc.B. and Ph.D. from the University of Paris where he carried out research on neutron counting. Research during World War II He joined Fr√©d√©ric Joliot- Curie's group in 1934, where Hans von Halban came in 1937. They established in 1939 the possibility of nuclear chain reactionsH. von Halban, F. Joliot and L. Kowarski, Nature 143 (1939) 470 and 680. and nuclear energy production. While doing their research, the events of World War II forced them to eventually move to England, bringing with them the world's entire stock of heavy water, given on loan by Norway to France so that it would not fall into German hands. They continued their research at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge for the MAUD Committee, part of the wartime Tube Alloys project. Just before the invasions, the records and papers of Fr√©d√©ric Joliot, Hans Halban and Lew Kowarski were smuggled out of France, and eventually to England. Included in this operation were 26 drums of heavy water, the world‚Äôs entire stock at the time. Some of the papers written by Halban and Kowarski were deposited at the Royal Society in the UK, where they were sealed with a note from James Chadwick, dated December 18, 1941, that said, ‚ÄúThe paper is such that it would be inadvisable to publish it at the present time.‚Äù The papers described the outline of a design for a nuclear fission reactor.Cohen, David. 2007. ‚ÄúSecret Fission Papers were too Hot to Handle.‚Äù New Scientist. Issue 2607, June 11, 2007, page 10. Kowarski then worked in the Montreal Laboratory in Canada, but only after Halban had been replaced as Director by John Cockcroft, as he did not want to work under Halban. He supervised the construction of Canada's first nuclear reactor (ZEEP) at the Chalk River Laboratories in 1945. Post war research He came back to France to supervise the first two French reactors in 1948 and 1952. A staff member of CERN (Geneva) since participating in its formation in 1953, he was a Decorated Officer Legion of Honor, Fellow of the American Nuclear Society, and a recipient of citation and prize from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. After his retirement in 1972, he was a University Professor at Boston University, focusing on the interaction between Science and Mankind.How it All Began in Canada - The Role of the French Scientists , Bertrand Goldschmidt  Recently discovered documents In 1940, James Chadwick forwarded the work of two French scientists, Hans von Halban and Kowarski, who worked in Cambridge, to the Royal Society. He asked that the papers be held, as they were not appropriate for publication during the war. In 2007, the Society discovered the documents during an audit of their archives.BBC Article about discovered documents The documents describe how to control the chain reaction, describe the components of a nuclear reactor, and describe how to produce plutonium.

Vladimir Shukhov invented hyperboloid towers and was also the first one to use them in construction. For the 1896 All-Russia industrial and art exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod he built the 37-meter steel diagrid tower, which became the first hyperboloid structure in the world. The hyperboloid steel gridshell attracted attention of European observers. In particular, the British magazine The Engineer published an article about the tower.\\"The Nijni-Novgorod exhibition: Water tower, room under construction, springing of 91 feet span\\", The Engineer, 1897, ‚Ññ 19.3. ‚Äì pp. 292‚Äì294 After the exhibition closed, the openwork tower was bought by a leading glassware manufacturer and art sponsor, Yury Nechaev-Maltsov. It was relocated to his estate in Polibino where it has been preserved until now. The estate is currently under state protection (federal level) as a former property of the Nechayev family. The estate consists of a palace, English park, regular gardens, ponds, and more. In the subsequent years, Vladimir Shukhov developed numerous structures of various hyperboloid steel gridshells and used them in hundreds of water towers, sea lighthouses, masts of warships and supports for power transmission lines. Similar hyperboloid structures appeared abroad only ten years after Shukhov's invention.

In terms of knights killed, it was the fourth largest defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century. Marshal Heinrich Botel gathered men from Kulm, Elbing, and Balga for an expeditionary attack deeper into Prussia. They traveled into the lands of Natangians and pillaged the region. On their way back they were in turn attacked by an army of Natangians. The Knights retreated to the nearby village of Kr√ºcken south of Kreuzburg (now Kamenka south of Slavskoye), where Prussians hesitated to attack. The Prussian army was growing as fresh troops arrived from more distant territories, and the Knights did not have enough supplies to withstand a siege. Therefore, the Teutonic Knights bargained for surrender: the marshal and three other knights were to remain as hostages while the others were to lay down their weapons. The Natangians broke the agreement and massacred 54 knights and a number of their followers. Some knights were executed in religious ceremonies or tortured to death. The severed head of Johann, vice-komtur of Balga, was mockingly displayed on a spear. Others were ransomed or exchanged, including Marshal Botel. Such barbarity gave the Knights an excuse not to treat the Prussians as civilized and honorable people. Never again did the Knights surrender to pagans. The Natangians did not exploit their victory and did not make offensive moves into the lands of the Teutonic Knights. It took two years for the crusading military order to recover and avenge the massacre.

Military career Bindon Blood was born near Jedburgh, Scotland, to William Bindon Blood (1817‚Äì1894) and Margaret Stewart (1820‚Äì1849). He was related to Colonel Thomas Blood who attempted to steal the Crown Jewels in 1671. He attended the Royal School, Banagher, Queen's College, Galway, and the Addiscombe Military College. He was commissioned in 1860 in the Royal Engineers as a temporary lieutenant in charge of signalling and pontoon bridge construction in India, and for brief periods in Zululand and South Africa. Promoted to captain in 1873, he served with British forces in the North-West Frontier (Jowaki). In 1879 he was sent back to Africa for the Anglo-Zulu War. He went on to fight in the Second Anglo-Afghan War and the battle of Tel-el- Kebir. By 1882 he was a brevet lieutenant-colonel. The following year, 1883, Blood married Charlotte E. Colvin, second daughter of Sir Auckland Colvin, a distinguished colonial administrator in India from a well-connected family. Then he returned to India and took command of the Bengal Sappers and Miners in 1885. After seven years he reached the rank of brigadier-general, serving in the garrison at Rawalpindi, and then in the relief force known as the Chitral Expedition. He then commanded the Malakand Field Force and the Buner Field Force, relieving the garrison during the siege of Malakand. At the end of this command he was promoted to major-general.

History The National Library and Archives of Bhutan. The National Library of Bhutan was first established in 1967 under the patronage of HM Queen Ashi Phuntso Choden (1911‚Äì2003), with a small collection of precious texts. The library was initially housed within the central tower (utse) of Tashichodzong. Later, due to its growing collection, it had to move to a building in the Changgangkha area of Thimphu. To provide a permanent home for the sacred religious books and manuscripts in the growing collection, construction of the present four- storeyed eight-cornered traditional building, which looks like the central tower temple of a Bhutanese Dzong, in the Kawajangtsa area of Thimphu was initiated. The cost of the construction of this building was borne entirely by the Royal Government of Bhutan without any foreign aid. This building, which houses the collection of traditional texts, was inaugurated and consecrated as a temple by H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche on November 23, 1984 in order to provide a sacred space for the religious books which form the bulk of the collection. The library moved into its permanent home at the end of 1984 under the auspices of the then Special Commission for Cultural Affairs. =Directors= # Geshe Tshewang (1967 to 1973) # Lopen Pemala (1973 to 1993) # Sangay Wangchug (1993 to 1999) # Mynak R.Tulku (1999 to 2004) # Dorjee Tshering (2005 to 2007) # Gyonpo Tshering (2007 to 2010) # Harka B. Gurung (2010 to present) National Archives The National Archives is responsible for collecting and preserving important past, present and future documents on Bhutan for future generations. In July 2000 Denmark signed an agreement to support the National Archives to provide assistance for the construction of a modern archive building. This two storied building, which was completed in 2004 is equipped with a modern security and fire alarm system as well as temperature and humidity control. =Our National Memory Bank= The repository rooms of the archives now house many important documents including old records, old letters and around seven thousand important photographs. The archives also hold microfilms of many other important documents. Particularly rare and important books and manuscripts from the National Library collection are also kept in their secure and controlled facilities. Thus the archives is the foundation of our National Memory Bank. The National Archives solicits co- operation from all concerned in its effort to create our National Memory Bank. We therefore request individuals and institutions, inside and outside the country holding important documents and other material related to Bhutan which may be of interest to future generations, to provide copies for our National Archives. =Microfilming Facility & Service= The National Library offers a free microfilming service for institutions and individuals within Bhutan holding important and rare texts and documents. They actively encourage anyone holding such documents to bring them to the library for microfilming in order to ensure the long term preservation of the contents of these documents should anything happen to the original. Upon microfilming the original text or document will be returned to the provider along with one microfilm copy, and one copy will be held in the archives in safe and secure controlled storage conditions. =Conservation & Preservation= The archives primarily deals with paper documents. Paper is composed of organic materials which deteriorate with the passage of time. Documents printed on modern paper often contain bleaches and other chemicals which can speed up this deterioration. Similarly photographs and film often contains chemical traces left over from processing which can cause deterioration. Therefore, when documents or photographs are selected for preservation it is important that they are treated to neutralize these harmful chemical residues. = Legal Deposit Act = National Assembly of Bhutan hereby enacts this Legal Deposit Act: An Act to Collect, Preserve and Manage Bhutan‚Äôs Documentary Heritage in July 20, 1999 to legally collect and save print, non-print, electronic, audio visual and electronic texts, all the forms of documents that relate to the Bhutan and national interests. There are eight parts in the Legal Deposit Act. =Future Plans= In the 10th five- year plan the National Archives plans to carry out a nationwide survey to determine where records of national importance are located; and in what form, shape and condition these records are being maintained. If such records are not being taken care of properly we will endeavour to assist the owners and custodians of these records to ensure their proper preservation. They also plan to create special Oral History Tradition and Audio Visual Unit to survey, create and maintain Oral History and Audio Visual documentation for the nation.

The John Taylor Building, the first new building on campus in 17 years, was constructed during his tenure. Bennion left Ricks College in 1997 to become the president of Southern Utah University. In 2006, Bennion left Southern Utah University to serve as president of the LDS Church's New York New York South Mission. He served as mission president until 2009. Bennion is the grandson of prominent Utah educator Milton Bennion, who served as the first president of what would later become Southern Utah University. In addition to being a mission president, Bennion has served in the LDS Church as a bishop and a member of a stake presidency. From 2013 to 2016, Bennion served as president of the Manhattan New York Temple.

He received his degree in physical education from University of New Mexico. After he graduated he became the first physical education teacher at Aspen Elementary in Albuquerque, New Mexico when it opened. John Baker also started a running team called the Duke City Dashers. Baker was later diagnosed with cancer; he died shortly thereafter, at the age of 26. The students in the school petitioned the school board to change the name of Aspen Elementary to John Baker Elementary. The school's name was changed the next year, where an astounding 520 people voted for the change, and no one against it, and is still called John Baker Elementary. A Shining Season Bill Buchanan wrote a full-length biography of Baker called A Shining Season. A TV movie based on the book was created in 1979. John Baker was told he had 6 months to live, at the time of diagnosis. Through his sheer determination, he lived a year beyond the expectation his doctor gave him. John Baker's Last Race Brigham Young University also made a movie about John Baker in 1976 entitled John Baker's Last Race. A DVD of the movie is available through BYU's Creative Works Office.

The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1965 was also part of (Title III). Basic provisions Sec 201 of the Act authorized the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers (of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) to design and construct any water resource development project, including navigation, flood control, and shore protection if the cost of any single project did not exceed $10 million. Any such project was subject to local cost sharing in the same manner as larger projects. Surveys Sec 208 of the Act authorized the Corps of Engineers to conduct surveys for flood control and allied purposes, to include drainage and channel improvements. Impact on New Orleans The pre-Katrina Orleans Levee District (OLD), governed by the Orleans Levee Board (OLB), owned considerable assets, mainly real estate, a peculiarity that stems from its history. In the early twentieth century, the OLD reclaimed a portion of Lake Pontchartrain, a 24-mile wide lake north of New Orleans. The OLD developed the land and sold it to raise money to build and improve levees. The Lake Vista, Lake Oaks, Lake Terrace, East and West Lakeshore subdivisions and other property between Robert E. Lee Blvd and Lake Pontchartrain are all examples of these developed properties. The OLD also owned a marina and a small commercial airport on a man-made peninsula created from dredged material in the early 1930s. In the Flood Control Act of 1965‚Äì‚Äìlegislation enacted in response to losses exceeding $1 billion (including multiple levee failures) during Hurricane Betsy‚Äì‚ÄìCongress directed the Corps, from then forward, to be responsible for design and construction of the hurricane flood protection system enveloping New Orleans. The Corps was ordered to work in consultation with the OLD which became the local sponsor for the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane Protection Project. Congress directed the corps build a flood protection system to protect south Louisiana from the worst storms characteristic of the region. The corps began developing the storm model in 1959, called the Standard Project Hurricane (SPH). This model was not subsequently adjusted, despite the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (the successor agency to the Weather Bureau) recommending increasing the strength of the model: the Corps did not change its construction plans. The local levee boards retained the role of maintenance once the projects were complete. When authorized, this mandate was projected to take 13 years to complete. When Katrina struck in 2005, the project was between 60-90% complete and the projected date of completion was estimated to be 2015. Details of the congressional mandate are defined in the Government Accountability Office's testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on September 28, 2005. The opening paragraph of the twelve page report reads: > \\"Congress first authorized the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity, Louisiana > Hurricane Protection Project in the Flood Control Act of 1965. The project > was to construct a series of control structures, concrete floodwalls, and > levees to provide hurricane protection to areas around Lake Pontchartrain. > The project, when designed, was expected to take about 13 years to complete > and cost about $85 million. Although federally authorized, it was a joint > federal, state, and local effort.\\" In 2005, the estimated cost of construction for the completed project is $738 million with the federal share being $528 million and the local share $210 million. The initial scope of the project was to provide hurricane protection to areas around the lake in the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, St. Bernard, and St. Charles with the federal government paying 70 percent of the costs and the state and local interests paying 30 percent, the typical cost-share arrangement.http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/50xx/doc5045/doc17-Entire.pdf Specific projects Sec 204 of the Act authorized projects in the following locations: * St John River Basin, Maine * Housatonic River Basin, Connecticut * New England - Atlantic Coastal Area * Long Island Sound * New York - Atlantic Coastal Area * Elizabeth River Basin, New Jersey * Rahway River Basin, New Jersey * Neuse River Basin, North Carolina * Middle Atlantic Coastal Area * Flint River Basin, Georgia * Central and Southern Florida Basin * South Atlantic Coastal Area * Phillippi Creek Basin, Florida * Lower Mississippi River Basin, adapting the Birds Point - New Madrid project enacted by 45 Stat. 34 at an estimated cost of $189,109,000 * General Projects - Grand Isle, Morgan City, and Lake Ponchartrain, Louisiana (Lake Ponchartrain at a cost of $56,235,000) * Ouachita River Basin, Louisiana * Red River Basin, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas * Gulf of Mexico - various bayous in Texas * Rio Grande Basin, Texas at a cost of $12,493,000 * Arkansas River Basin, as authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1946 - various creeks and rivers in Colorado, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas * Missouri River Basin - various creeks and rivers in Kansas, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, Missouri, and Montana * Ohio River Basin - various creeks and rivers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia * Red River of the North Basin * Upper Mississippi River Basin - various projects in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota and South Dakota * Great Lakes Basin * Little Colorado River Basin * Gila River Basin, Arizona * Eel River, Whitewater River, Santa Ana River, Sacramento River, San Diego River Basins, California * San Francisco Bay Area * Columbia River Basin, Oregon and Washington San Francisco Bay water quality Sec 216 of the Act authorized the Corps of Engineers to study the water and wastewater quality of various bodies of water in the San Francisco Bay area.

Manufacturing facilities are located in Switzerland, Germany and the United States. Switzerland started manufacturing bookbinding equipment in 1946 under the name Grapha Maschinenfabrik. The first machine produced was a hand-fed saddle stitcher, later modernized by the ‚ÄúSwiss Girl‚Äù automatic feeder, which could be disengaged and tilted back when not in use. Grapha exhibited its first fully automatic saddle stitcher with in-line trimmer at Drupa in 1954. During the same time, the company was working on the development of an adhesive binder. In 1955, the company incorporated and changed its name to Grapha Maschinenfabrik Hans M√ºller A. G. That same year Muller sold its first machine in the United States. Other equipment was added, and in 1961 large-scale production of newspaper and magazine inserting machines was started. As Muller expanded, new manufacturing, sales and service facilities were set up abroad. A United States subsidiary, the Hans Muller Corp. was established in 1967. Martini joined the Muller organization in 1969. Founded by Friedrich von Martini, inventor of a precision rifle, Martini began manufacturing folding and stitching machines in 1850. Martini introduced its Book Sewing Machine in 1897, and more than 10,000 have been produced to date. The Martini automobile, powered by a Martini-designed internal combustion engine, was also introduced in 1897. Automobile production stopped in 1934, when the company decided to concentrate on book binding equipment. Adhesive binding machines were developed by Martini in 1941. Muller Martini developed its first offset web press for business forms in 1972 and is now a manufacturer of web presses for direct mail promotional graphics and commercial work. In 1973, Muller Martini USA offices relocated to Hauppauge, Long Island. At the same time, the company name was changed to Muller Martini Corp. A network of sales, product management and service personnel were also established throughout the United States with Regional Offices in the Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco areas. In the United States, Muller Martini started its first manufacturing facility in 1973 to produce bindery and mailroom equipment in Newport News, VA. This plant has been expanded in several steps and today is over , used for automated manufacturing as well as assembly, engineering, and new product development. In 1989, Daverio in Switzerland and KJ in Denmark became part of the Muller Martini, with the ability to produce and market complete newspaper inserting, press finishing and bindery systems, including conveyors and packaging lines for automatic production. GMA, located in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a supplier of newspaper mailroom systems to the United States market, was acquired by the Muller Martini group of companies in 1992. GMA was renamed Muller Martini Mailroom Systems. Muller Martini took over the manufacture of the VBF product line of case binding machines for hard cover book production in 1998. Manufacturing was moved to a new factory with its own training center in Bad Mergentheim, Germany, within 2 years. In 2007 VBF became Muller Martini Book Technology GmbH. As of January 2002, Muller Martini USA assumed marketing and customer service support for all VBF machines in the United States, along with casemakers made by Hoerauf.

Kyrklig f√∂rnyelse was the first of many books by Rosendal that would advocate High Church theology and Catholic liturgical renewal of the worship within the Church of Sweden. It was soon followed by Kyrklig f√∂rnyelse i f√∂rsamlinskyrkan (Church revival in parish church), where he answers to the discussion aroused by the book. Both these books were written, when Rosendal already had practised his reform in his own parish.  Content of the book  Kyrklig f√∂rnyelse has a comprehensive vision of what was needed for the Church. Rosendal proposed four features as basic to the Church: its confessional, sacramental, hierarchical and liturgical character: Book of Concord, sacraments, holy orders and liturgy. These four features each have their own chapter. Preaching of the Word and the Sacrament of the Altar must be the center of Christian life. Baptism must be more than a rite at birth; it must set its mark on the Christian life. The pastoral leadership of the hierarchy needed to be revitalized. The liturgy must be a witness to heavenly beauty and also to give expression to the whole meaning of the sacraments. The last chapter includes a warning. For those who see \\"danger of Roman Catholicism\\" in the revival, Rosendal points out that there is indeed a Roman danger, but it comes, if Catholic renewal is not carried through. In that case people will find One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church from the Church of Rome instead of State Church.

World War II  = 1940 = The 1re DFL officially formed on 1 February 1943 and was dissolved on 15 August 1945. However, for the veterans of this unit, the history of the division began in the summer of 1940. In London, on 30 June 1940, amongst the troops that fought in Norway, 900 men of the 13th Demi-Brigade of Foreign Legion, commanded by Lieutenant- Colonel Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, and 60 Chasseurs Alpins made the choice to resume combat. Elements of a tank company, sappers, artillerymen and sailors chose the same: they would later constitute the 1er R√©giment de Fusiliers Marins, 1er RFM. In the Middle East, 350 men of a battalion stationed in Cyprus, led by Captain Jean Lorotte de Banes passed to British Egypt. With 120 men of Captain Rapha√´l Folliot, who left French Lebanon on 27 June, they formed the 1st Marine Infantry Battalion, 1er BIM. They were joined by legionnaires of the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment (6e REI), sailors of the French Naval Squadron Force X, and a squadron of Moroccan Spahis of the 1st Spahi Regiment, commanded by Captain Paul Jourdier. In Africa, part of the 31st battery of the 6th Marine Artillery Regiment (), stationed at Bobo- Dioulasso, commanded by Captain Jean-Claude Laurent-Champrosay, passed from the French Upper Volta to the British Cameroons, forming the 1st Colonial Artillery Regiment (1er R√©giment d'artillerie coloniale, 1er RAC). Under the designation of Free French Expeditionary Corps (), the troops formed in London disembarked at Freetown in Sierra Leone and participated in the unsuccessful Battle of Dakar, before being directed, in October 1940, to Douala in the French Cameroons. In November 1940, the unit participated in the Battle of Gabon, before going to Durban in South Africa. = 1941 = Designated as the Free French Orient Brigade () and commanded by Colonel Magrin-Vernerey, the brigade left Durban and disembarked at Suakin to take part in the East African Campaign. The brigade was reinforced by the Pacific Battalion () and by troops of the French Equatorial Africa, the latter going from Brazzaville to Bangui, N'Djamena, before finally arriving at Khartoum and Suakin. The brigade participated in the Battle of Keren. Under the designation of 1st Light Free French Division () and under the command of General Paul Legentilhomme, the division joined the Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaign in June 1941, where they fought against fellow Frenchmen, aligned with Vichy. The division entered into Damascus on 21 June 1941, then continued to Homs, Aleppo, Beirut and arrived at Cairo, where the division was dissolved. The division is reconstituted under the form of two Free French brigades: * The 1st Independent Free French Brigade, 1e BFL, commanded by General Koenig * The 2nd Independent Free French Brigade, 2e BFL, commanded by General Cazaud * A 3rd Independent Free French Brigade remained in French Lebanon and Syria until the end of the war to ensure the protection of these two countries. = 1942 = right The 1e BFL distinguished itself at the Battle of Bir Hakeim from 26 May ‚Äì 11 June 1942, then in the Second Battle of El Alamein from October‚ÄìNovember 1942. The two brigades and the Free French Flying Column formed the French Forces of the Western Desert (), part of the British Eighth Army. = 1943 = These two brigades (plus a third coming from Djibouti), are united on 1 February 1943 in the 1st Free French Division, 1re DFL, commanded by General Edgard de Larminat and participate in the Tunisian Campaign. In June 1943, various troops of the Army of Africa () joined the ranks of the division. Accordingly, the division was sent to the desert of Libya during two and a half months, at the request of Henri Giraud. The 2e DFL of General Leclerc would follow the same procedure. After the reunification of the two French forces, on 1 August 1943, the division was officially designated as 1st Motorized Infantry Division () due to its integration in the French Expeditionary Corps in Italy. In 1944, the 1st Motorized Infantry Division became the 1st Marching Infantry Division (). Nevertheless, the unit remained known as the 1re DFL. = 1944 = Commanded by General Diego Brosset and now part of the French Expeditionary Corps, the division participated in the Italian Campaign since April 1944. With First Army, the division disembarked in Provence on 15 August 1944 and participated in the Battle of Toulon, then went up the Rh√¥ne after having sent a couple of reconnaissance squadrons to Montpellier. Lyon was reached on 3 September. In autumn 1944, the French Forces of the Interior joined the First Army, replacing the 6000 Africans of the division in what was referred during that period as blanchiment (whitening). General Brosset accidentally died on 20 November 1944 and was succeeded by General Pierre Garbay. = 1945 = The division made its way to the Vosges where it faced Operation Nordwind, the last major German offensive on the Western Front. Afterwards it joined the battles for the Colmar Pocket. In March 1945, the division participated in the Battle of Authion. It then took Tende and La Brigue.

The Southern and southwestern sides of the lake are rocky, barren and steep, having bays in which the sublacustrine springs, are usually to be found. On the northern side there is an enormous inundated area, the boundaries of which change as water levels fluctuate. Some small islands like Be≈°ka, with two churches on it and Grmo≈æur, a former fortress and prison can be found on the southwestern side of the lake. The climate type is hot-summer Mediterranean climate with dry summers (Csa), under K√∂ppen climate classification. The Montenegrin part of the lake and its surrounding area were declared a national park in 1983. The Albanian part has been designated as a Managed Nature Reserve. In 1996, by Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, it was included in the Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance. Near the mouth of Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa, below the surface of the water there is a well-preserved wreck of the steamboat Skanderbeg sunk by partisans in 1942, during the Second World War.

Most authors agree that the Lake Skadar basin is of tectonic origin which had been formed due to the complex folding and faulting within north eastern wing of Old Montenegro anticlynorium (High Karst Zone). These movements took place during the Cenozoic period. The Lake basin has been formed as the result of sinking of blocks in the Neogene period or even in Paleogene. In the Miocene and the Pliocene marine conditions prevailed in the Zeta Plain, which was sunk at the beginning of the upper Miocene, and that the sea inundated this plain up to Podgorica during the Pliocene. Radoman (1985)Radoman P. (1985). \\"Hydrobioidea a superfamily Prosobranchia (Gastropoda), II. Origin, Zoogeography, Evolution in the Balkans and Asia Minor\\". Monographs Institute of Zoology Belgrade 1: 1-173. pointed out that sea must have destroyed all the freshwater populations on this plane and in the Lake Skadar area. The connection of Lake Skadar with the sea was interrupted during the younger Pliocene. The question of the origin of its water is of particular interest for biologists as these waters may have provided its first species and been the basis for its present high degree of endemism. Fauna The Lake Skadar system is a well-known hotspot of freshwater biodiversity and harbors a highly diverse mollusc fauna. Lake Skadar is one of the largest bird reserves in Europe, having 270 bird species, among which are some of the last pelicans in Europe, and thus popular with birders. The lake also contains habitats of seagulls and herons. It is abundant in fish, especially in carp, bleak and eel. Of the 34 native fish species, 7 are endemic to Lake Skadar.Talevski, Milo≈°eviƒá, Mariƒá, Petroviƒá, Talevska and Talevska (2009). Biodiversity of Ichthyofauna from Lake Prespa, Lake Ohrid and Lake Skadar. Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment, 23(2). ISSN 1310-2818 At the scale of Lake Skadar, about 31% of freshwater snails (12 out of 39 species sampled in the lake) are endemic. At the scale of the Lake Skadar basin, 38% (19 species) of the total freshwater gastropod fauna appear to be endemic. There were reliably recorded 50 species of freshwater snails from the Lake Skadar basin. The index of freshwater gastropod endemism is 0.478. With this relatively high value, Lake Skadar exceeds such famous lakes as Lake Malawi and Lake Titicaca. The Lake Skadar is inhabited by five species of Bithynia and it is a hot spot of Bithynia evolution. There are 17 amphipod species for the Lake Skadar watershed, 10 of them being endemic (mainly from the subterranean habitat). The small range of many endemic species living in the Lake Skadar system together with ever increasing human pressure make its fauna particularly vulnerable. This becomes even more important in light of ongoing eutrophication, water pollution and sand and gravel exploration activities in the lake and its basin. Research of the phytoplankton community and chlorophyllbased trophic state indices show that the lake is on a betamesosaprobic level of saprobity, which means moderately polluted with organic compounds. Effects of human-induced environmental changes are especially evident for sublacustrine springs, with eutrophication and using for water supplying (e.g., sublacustrine spring Karuƒç) being the most serious threats. The 2011 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species includes 21 endemic species from the Lake Skadar basin. Cultural impact Radio Skadar, a radio station in Montenegro, based in Podgorica is named after Lake Skadar.

The tradition reaches back to Italian language entertainments of the baroque. Romantic opera in Polish flourished alongside nationalism after the partition and is exemplified by the work of Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko. In the 20th century Polish opera was exported and composers such as Krzysztof Penderecki wrote operas in other languages (Ubu Rex, Die Teufel von Loudun) that were translated into Polish later. 17th century W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV, Poland's first opera patron W≈Çadys≈Çaw's Opera Hall (right) at the Royal Castle, Warsaw Operas were first performed in Poland during the Baroque era in the reign of Sigismund III Vasa (1587-1632). The king himself had no interest in the arts, but his son W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV (reigned 1632-1648) was an enthusiast and patron of opera while he was still a prince. In 1625 Francesca Caccini wrote an opera for W≈Çadys≈Çaw when she visited Italy. This opera, La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d'Alcina, was also performed in Warsaw in 1628; this is the earliest verified performance of an Italian opera outside of Italy.Warrack p.240; Viking p.174 Gli amori di Aci e Galatea by Santi Orlandi was also performed in 1628.Grout p.529 When W≈Çadys≈Çaw became king, he had operas staged in the hall of the royal castle and he invited Marco Scacchi's opera troupe to Poland. A dramma per musica (as serious Italian opera was known at the time) entitled Giuditta, based on the Biblical story of Judith, was performed in 1635. The composer was probably Virgilio Puccitelli. During the reign of W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV a dozen or so operas were performed whose music has not survived. Saxon era (1697-1763) Johann Adolph Hasse The next kings John II Casimir of Poland, Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki and John III Sobieski were too busy fighting wars to show much concern for opera, although such works that did appear were highly esteemed. After the Elector of Saxony was voted King of Poland in 1697, the situation changed. The German ruler presided over a thriving operatic scene at his court in Dresden. The first public opera house in Poland was opened in 1724. The great moderniser of Polish opera was another Saxon, King August III. In 1748 he built an opera house in which works by Italian and German composers were regularly staged. A star of European opera, the composer Johann Adolf Hasse, also arrived in Poland. His work there increased opera's popularity amongst the nobility and raised the artistic standards of Polish opera to an international level. Hasse wrote the opera seria Zenobia, to a libretto by Pietro Metastasio, especially for Warsaw in 1761.Warrack p.240 Late 18th century Warsaw, 1770, by CanalettoA high point of Polish opera occurred during the reign of the last king of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, in spite of the political troubles that afflicted the country. During this time Poland was carved up by its neighbours, Prussia, Austria and Russia, in a series of three Partitions between 1772 and 1795, when the country disappeared off the map of Europe. Yet culture thrived, a National Theatre was opened in 1779, and it was probably during this era that the first operas in Polish were written, although not even the titles and authors of these pieces are known. In 1777 Franciszek Bohomolec wrote the text for a cantata, Nƒôdza uszczƒô≈õliwiona (Poverty Made Happy). Wojciech Bogus≈Çawski quickly turned this into a libretto for an opera which was staged with music by Maciej Kamie≈Ñski. It is the first known opera in the Polish language. The composer was a Polonised Czech; Bogus≈Çawski and Bohomolec were Polish noblemen. Bogus≈Çawski threw himself into writing drama, which later earned him the name of \\"the father of Polish theatre\\". Bogus≈Çawski wrote and staged the opera buffa Henryk IV na ≈Çowach (Henri IV Goes Hunting) with music by Jan Stefani. It was followed by Cud mniemany, czyli Krakowiacy i G√≥rale (The Supposed Miracle, or the Krakowians and the Highlanders). The text of the latter was lost during the January Uprising of 1863 and only rediscovered in 1929 by Leon Schiller (who called it a \\"Polish national opera\\"). The premiere took place on 1 March 1794 to unprecedented applause. It occurred a few weeks before the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising against the foreign powers and the opera itself included pro- Ko≈õciuszko slogans. The authorities had the opera removed after four performances due to its unexpected popularity and anti-Partition allusions.Warrack p.241; Viking pp.522 and 1008 Polish National Opera The fall of Poland did not stop operatic activity in the country. Wojciech Bogus≈Çawski was still at work. In the 1790s, J√≥zef Elsner emerged in Lw√≥w (Lviv, then Lemburg in the region conquered by Austria). Almost none of his many operas has survived, the most notable extant work being Amazonki, czyli Herminia (The Amazons, or Herminia). When Elsner took over the National Theatre in Warsaw, he began to write operas which made use of Polish folk music. Karol Kurpi≈Ñski He began his work in Warsaw by composing an opera to a libretto by Bogus≈Çawski called Iskahar. However, he was doubtful of its success, since his knowledge of the Polish language was too limited for an adequate musical expression of the words. He was also concerned with the problem of the change of accents in the sung text, which could become unintelligible if they were muddled. Elsner soon (1799) became the principal conductor at the National Theatre. In 1810 he was joined by composer Karol Kurpi≈Ñski, who took up the post of second conductor. The two began a rivalry which lasted thirteen years until Elsner was removed by the Ruling Committee of the National Theatre at Kurpi≈Ñski's request. By that time he had managed to write 30 operas. In 1809 he scored a notable triumph with Leszek Bia≈Çy (Leszek the White), to a libretto by Bogus≈Çawski. After this only the comic opera Siedem razy jeden (Seven Times One) and Kr√≥l ≈Åokietek (King Elbow-High) brought him moderate success. Elsner had been born in Silesia and his first language was German, leading his critics to deny that he was truly Polish and to accuse him of sympathizing with the foreign invaders. The composer had praised some of the partitioning rulers, including Tsar Alexander I of Russia. After the November Uprising of 1830 he adopted a diametrically opposite opinion. For years he defended the Polish language as beautiful and fit for singing. He was an ardent proponent of Polish opera (by his time there were 300 works in the language in existence), particularly in the first ever account of the national tradition - Die Oper der Polen - published in 1812. During this time Karol Kurpi≈Ñski began to enjoy great success. Kurpi≈Ñski composed 18 operas. All of them were enthusiastically received, but his best known works were Zamek w Czorsztynie (The Castle in Czorsztyn) and Zabobon, czyli Krakowiacy i G√≥rale. The first was the prototype of Moniuszko's The Haunted Manor. The second was a new opera to Bogus≈Çawski's libretto. Kurpi≈Ñski also won acclaim for Nagroda, czyli wskrzeszenie Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego (The Prize, or the Resurrection of the Kingdom of Poland). As an ardent patriot and opponent of the foreign occupation, Kurpi≈Ñski used his music as part of the struggle for independence (just as Giuseppe Verdi did in Italy). Following on from Elsner, Kurpi≈Ñski significantly modernised the National Theatre. He introduced many works to the Polish stage including Mozart's Don Giovanni, Spontini's La vestale, Auber's Fra Diavolo, Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz and many other operas by Donizetti, Meyerbeer and Rossini. In 1833 Antionio Corazzi, an Italian from Livorno, built a new theatre for the National Opera in Warsaw. The house was opened with a performance of Rossini's The Barber of Seville. Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko is regarded as the true creator of Polish national opera.Viking p.671 His role in the Polish tradition is similar to that of Glinka in the Russian, Smetana in the Czech and Ferenc Erkel in the Hungarian. In 1837 Moniuszko returned to Poland after receiving his musical education abroad. Ten years later he wrote the famous Polish Romantic opera Halka. The first, two-act version had its premiere in Vilnius, and a second, four-act version was performed in Warsaw ten years later. The work is regarded as one of the finest Polish national operas. It is made up of musical forms from the Polish folk tradition - polonaises, mazurkas and dumkas - and was the first Polish opera to be \\"through-composed\\" (i.e. the entire libretto is set to music and there is no spoken dialogue).Booklet notes to the recording of Halka by Robert Satanowski (CPO 1987) The libretto of Halka, by W≈Çodzimierz Wolski is recognised as one of the finest Polish literary works of its time. Critics have noted certain similarities to Goethe's Faust. Moniuszko's next most important work is Straszny Dw√≥r (The Haunted Manor), more comic in spirit than Halka. It has a libretto by Jan Chƒôci≈Ñski which is full of allusions to the Polish noble tradition of Sarmatism and pro-independence sentiments, which led to the opera being banned. The premiere took place in 1865 to great applause, yet the authorities withdrew it after a handful of performances. Polish school of opera One of Moniuszko's followers was W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ªele≈Ñski. Though he was never actually one of Moniuszko's students, he modeled his works on Moniuszko, thus inheriting his musical style. He was the father of the writer and translator Tadeusz Boy- ≈ªele≈Ñski, who would go on to translate many opera libretti. ≈ªele≈Ñski's music is firmly rooted in Romanticism and his operas follow the example of Moniuszko. ≈ªele≈Ñski wrote four operatic works: Konrad Wallenrod, Goplana, Janek, Stara Ba≈õ≈Ñ. The first is based on the poem by Mickiewicz and is full of pro-independence sentiments, as are the three others. Goplana is based on Juliusz S≈Çowacki's play Balladyna. All are Slavophil and Romantic in character. They belong to the Slavic craze among Polish Romantics which was started by Zorian Do≈Çƒôga-Chodakowski. An important 20th century Polish opera, Manru (1901) was composed by Ignacy Paderewski to a libretto by Alfred NossigInitially in German and premiered in Dresden (Viking, p.750). based on the novel Chata za wsiƒÖ by J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski. To this day that opera, which received its American premiere at the Metropolitan opera in 1902,On 14 February (Viking, p.750). remains the only Polish opera by the Polish composer ever performed there. Other examples of modern opera are Boles≈Çaw ≈ömia≈Çy (Boles≈Çaw the Bold) and Casanova by Ludomir R√≥≈ºycki (the first to a libretto by Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski). The same composer wrote music to a text by Jerzy ≈ªu≈Çawski and created one of the outstanding modernist operas - Eros i Psyche (Cupid and Psyche). Important works from the early 20th century are Legenda Ba≈Çtyku (The Legend of the Baltic) by Feliks Nowowiejski and Kr√≥l Zygmunt August (King Zygmunt August) by Tadeusz Joteyko. Karol Szymanowski Karol Szymanowski wrote only two operas, both completely breaking away from the model of Moniuszko. The first, Hagith, was influenced by Richard Strauss's Salome and was a failure at its premiere in 1922. Much more important was King Roger (1926). This work was slow to gain a reputation and was considered marginal until the 1990s. It has now been performed with great success in the United Kingdom, France and Spain. Formally, King Roger draws on the tradition of oratorio as it much as it does that of opera; the chorus is a constant presence throughout almost its entire length. It is a varied work, moving from a style influenced by the singing of the Eastern Orthodox Church to dense chromatic harmony, and is considered the most important Polish opera of the 20th century.Viking pp.1076-78 Post-war opera Under the Communist regime in Poland (1945-1989), socialist realism was an officially endorsed artistic policy. An example of a Polish socialist realist opera is Bunt ≈ºak√≥w (The Schoolboys' Revolt, 1951) by Tadeusz Szeligowski which tells the story of the conflict between \\"proletarian\\" schoolboys and King Zygmunt II August in 1549. The same composer wrote other operas including ones for children. Another composer of this type was Witold Rudzi≈Ñski, whose works include Janko Muzykant (Janko the Musician, 1953) and Komendant Pary≈ºa (The Commandant of Paris, 1960). Rudzi≈Ñski was influenced by a far younger composer, Krzystof Penderecki. Rudzi≈Ñski's finest opera is Odprawa pos≈Ç√≥w greckich (The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys), based on the play by the leading Renaissance poet Jan Kochanowski; the opera has elements of sonorism. Gra≈ºyna BacewiczAn important composer of the post-war era was Romuald Twardowski who won fame for his operas Cyrano de Bergerac (1963) and Lord Jim (1976). Other important works were written by Tadeusz Paciorkiewicz (Romans gda≈Ñski, 1968), J√≥zef ≈öwider (Wit Stwosz, 1974, about the famous woodcarver), Henryk Czy≈º (Kynolog w rozterce after a play by S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek, 1967; Inge Bartsch after Konstanty Ildefons Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski, 1982), Tadeusz Baird (the famous Jutro, based on the short story \\"Tomorrow\\" by Joseph Conrad, 1966, which won many European awards and was turned into a film). A trend for reinterpreting literature emerged. Such works include Pier≈õcie≈Ñ wielkiej damy (after Cyprian Norwid) by Ryszard Bukowski, Edward Bogus≈Çawski's Sonata Belzebuba (after Witkacy, 1977), Zbigniew Bargielski's Ma≈Çy KsiƒÖ≈ºƒô (after Le Petit Prince by Antoine de Saint- Exup√©ry, 1970) and Krzystof Baculewski's ' (New Liberation, 1986). There also arose a trend for unstaged opera. This led to works for the radio by Gra≈ºyna Bacewicz (Przygody Kr√≥la Artura -The Adventures of King Arthur, 1959), Jerzy Sikorski (Muzyczna opowie≈õƒá niemal≈ºe o ko≈Ñcu ≈õwiata - A Musical Tale About the End of the World 1958), Tadeusz Szeligowski (Odys p≈ÇaczƒÖcy -Odysseus Weeping 1961) and Zbigniew Penherski (SƒÖd nad Samsonem - Judgement on Samson 1969). Television operas were also written by Krzystof Meyer (the famous Cyberiad after the science-fiction stories by Stanis≈Çaw Lem, 1970) and Maciej Ma≈Çecki (Balladyna, 1999). Krzysztof Penderecki Krzysztof Penderecki Sonorist opera was created by Krzysztof Penderecki, who composed one of the most famous contemporary operas in 1969: Diab≈Çy z Loudun (The Devils of Loudun, libretto by John Whiting after the book by Aldous Huxley). The opera, inspired by Wagner and psychoanalysis, makes extensive use of sonorism. It provoked a great deal of discussion among critics and the composer's next work was eagerly awaited. The Devils of Loudun immediately became a classic of contemporary opera thanks to its innovative style. To aid his sonorist experiments, Penderecki's created a new way of notating music. The opera was later filmed. Penderecki's next opera Paradise Lost also received good reviews. The next stage in Penderecki's development was Die schwarze Maske, first performed in Salzburg during The Summer Festival in 1986 to mixed reactions. When Penderecki abandoned sonorism he decided to compose a \\"Polish\\" opera. Ubu Rex is based on the farce by Alfred Jarry, Ubu roi, which takes place in Poland. The opera was in German, although the librettist, Jerzy Jarocki, was Polish. The opera received a mixed response: some greeted it with applause and standing ovations, but other members of the audience angrily walked out of the theatre. Nevertheless, the opera had such a strong reception that it gained the attention of audiences outside Poland. Recent developments The most recent composers of opera are Krzystof Knittel, Eugeniusz Knapik and Roman Palester. In 1999, Knittel wrote Heart Piece ‚Äì Double Opera, which makes use of rock music. Knapik composed the operatic trilogy Das Glas im Kopf wird vom Glas (1990), Silent Screams, Difficult Dreams (1992) and La libert√† chiama la libert√† (1996). The composer uses English, German and Italian - three traditional operatic languages. Palester wrote ≈ömierƒá Don Juana (The Death of Don Juan), a dodecaphonic work to a text by Oscar Milosz, which the composer himself translated from French. Among the latest major Polish operas are Antygona (2001) by Zbigniew Rudzi≈Ñski, Balthazar and The Trap (2011) by Zygmunt Krauze, Ignorant i Szaleniec by Pawe≈Ç Mykietyn and Madame Curie (2011) by El≈ºbieta Sikora.

The ST-124-M3 inertial platform was a device for measuring acceleration and attitude of the Saturn V launch vehicle. It was carried by the Saturn V Instrument Unit, a , section of the Saturn V that fit between the third stage (S-IVB) and the Apollo spacecraft. Its nomenclature means \\"stable table\\" (ST) for use in the moon mission (M), and it has 3 gimbals. Development It was number 124 in a series of similar devices, including the ST-80 (used in the Redstone), the ST-90 (used on the Jupiter and on early Saturn I flights), and the ST-120 (used in the Pershing missile). They are descendants of the LEV-3 of the German V-2 rocket. The ST-124 was designed by Marshall Space Flight Center and manufactured by Bendix Corporation, Eclipse-Pioneer Division, in Teterboro, New Jersey. It took 9 men 22 to 24 weeks to assemble an ST-124, and 70 percent of that time was spent installing about 3,000 wires. Mission history The ST-124 stabilized platform was part of the guidance, navigation, and control system of the Saturn V. Data from the ST-124 were used by the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (another Instrument Unit component) to compare actual flight data to programmed flight plans and to calculate guidance corrections. Though the ST-124 operated all during the mission, its data were not used for guidance while the vehicle was in the atmosphere, where it was subjected to high drag forces. In this region, basically the time of the first stage burn, the vehicle followed a simple preprogrammed flight plan. Frank Cornella delivered the instruments (Gyro's and accelerometers) from Teterboro New Jersey to Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama. Internal details The attitude of the vehicle was measured relative to a coordinate system that was fixed just prior to launch with the X coordinate vertical, the Z coordinate in the direction of the pitch maneuver (down range, roughly East), and the Y coordinate perpendicular to the other two, cross range, roughly South. At the heart of the ST-124 was a platform that was held in a fixed orientation; hence the name \\"stabilized platform\\". It is connected by three gimbals that allowed the vehicle to roll, pitch and yaw but the stable platform to be held fixed in space. It was being translated, of course, but did not tilt during flight. The platform is stabilized by three gyros mounted on it. One measured any rotations about the X axis, one about the Y, and one about the Z axis. They generated signals that were shaped in feedback circuits and sent back to torquers on the inner, middle and outer gimbals that exactly countered the rotations, nulling the gyro outputs and keeping the platform stable. The inner gimbal also carries three accelerometers, two pendulums, and a pair of prisms. The accelerometers measured vehicle acceleration along the X, Y, and Z axes. Their outputs were used by the LVDC to measure actual vehicle motion, for the purpose of navigation. The pendulums were used to set the X axis exactly vertical, and the prisms were used to align the Y and Z axes, just before launch. The prisms reflected infrared beams sent into the ST-124 by a theodolite stationed 700 feet away from the launch pad. Commands from the theodolite were transmitted via cables to the vehicle, to torquers in the ST-124 to orient the stable platform toward the correct azimuth. The gyros, accelerometers and pendulums contain almost frictionless nitrogen gas bearings. These required very precise machining and very small gaps between the bearing surfaces. Dimensions were held to tolerances of , and the gap filled by the nitrogen is about . Nitrogen entered the gyros at about 15 psi and was vented to space via a pressure regulator in the bottom of the ST-124 that opened at 13 psi. The large silver sphere to the left of the ST-124 held the supply of nitrogen for the bearings. The ST-124 includes many components made of anodized beryllium. This material was chosen for its stiffness, light weight, machinability and stability. The case of the ST-124 is a short cylinder, high and in diameter, made of beryllium. The ends of the cylinder are closed by two approximately hemispherical aluminum covers. The gimbals and several parts of the gyros and accelerometers are also made of beryllium. In contrast to beryllium, which is lightweight, the rotors of the gyros are made of Elkonite, a very dense, strong alloy. This is a sintered form of copper‚Äìtungsten, W90/Cu10, to make it machinable. Heat generated by torquers and other electrical equipment inside the ST-124 was carried away by cooling coils built into the aluminum covers. A mixture of methanol and water at was circulated through the coils. The internal temperature of the ST-124 stabilized at about .

Ryan was arrested in 1984 after reports and a criminal investigation indicated that he had abused and killed five-year-old Luke Stice and later killed fellow group member James Thimm after he had tortured the latter for several days, beating him, whipping him, then shooting off his fingertips, skinning him alive, breaking his legs, and raping him with a shovel before finally stomping him to death. Ryan was tried, convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death on September 12, 1985. He claimed to be in direct contact with God and vowed to spend his days in prison rewriting the Bible, but he later recanted both statements. He died of natural causes at the Tecumseh State Correctional Institution on death row on May 24, 2015.

The village is located 14 km North-West of the town of Struga. The village is situated near the villages of Oktisi, Vele≈°ta, Podgorci, Gorna Belica with the Albanian border to the West of the village. = Vevƒçani Springs = The famous Vevƒçani springs are some of the most famous springs to be found in North Macedonia. The springs are located on the eastern slope of the Jablanica mountain range which run through the village of Vevƒçani at an approximately sea level altitude at over 900 metres. The largest spring is located at the opening of one of the many caves in the region. Below the largest spring are ten minor springs which all converge together. The most famous spring is \\"Jankov Kamen\\" which is situated at 1200 metres above sea level. Another spring is \\"Mala Livada\\" from which the water has a unique flavour and colour. It is situated at over 1600 metres above sea level. The highest spring is \\"Golina\\" situated at over 2000 metres above sea level. The rate of water flow from the springs is estimated to exceed the rate of 1500 litres per second, most notably in Spring. =Vevƒçani Lakes= Within the vicinity of the village of Vevƒçani there are many glacial lakes. The highest and most prominent glacial lake is \\"Lokva\\" which is situated at over 2000 metres above sea level on Mount Jablanica. It is the main provider of water to the \\"Golina\\" spring. Etymology The word \\"Vevƒçani\\" is based on an Old Church Slavonic word. The word Ves () which meant village in Old Church Slavonic. The word Vesƒçani meant in Old Church Slavonic, \\"people of Ves\\" or \\"Vesians\\". This soon became the name of the settlement. By the 14th century, the name \\"Ve≈°ƒçani\\" was being used. In the 17th century records, the village is referred to Ve≈°ƒçano (–í–µ—à—á–∞–Ω–æ). By the early 20th century, the village was often referred to as Vehƒçani (–í–µ—Ö—á–∞–Ω–∏) or Vesƒçani (–í–µ—Å—á–∞–Ω–∏), until the name Vevƒçani () was officially adopted. The village is also known as Ve√ßani in Albanian and Vevƒçani in both Serbian and Bulgarian. History =Early history= It was believed that the village of Vevƒçani had been founded sometime during period from the end of the 6th century to the beginning of the 8th century. The village was founded most probably by Berziti, who had adopted Christianity. The first settlement was originally at the foot of the Jablanica mountain. It was believed to have been founded in a place known as Seli≈°te (Old Church Slavonic: –°—î–ª–∏—à—Ç—î). However, the newest archaeological researches show that the village was there at least in second century B.C. It can not be excluded that somewhere in 6th century newly settled village Seliste merged with the long existing village. The crucial fact is that right above the village, the remains of a Roman camp have been found, and history states that Romans usually camped near villages to be able to get supplies. =Ottoman Empire= After the Battle of Kosovo, the area was under Ottoman rule for many centuries. =After the Balkan Wars= After the Balkans Wars, the village of Vevƒçani fell under Serbian rule. It was a part of the Vardar Banovina during the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The name of the village was officially changed to Ve√ßani. A group of partisans was created in Vevƒçani on 17 September 1944. The group occupied the village as a part of the \\"Drimkol\\" group of partisans. =Under Communist rule= In 1945, the village of Vevƒçani became a part of the newly founded People's Republic of Macedonia. In 1945 the municipality of Vevƒçani was founded which included the nearby villages of Oktisi and Gorna Belica. This was dissolved in 1952 as Vevƒçani became a part of the Vele≈°ta municipality until 1956. In 1956 it was merged with the Struga Municipality. Vevƒçani Emergency The Vevƒçani Emergency () was an incident which occurred in the village on 26 May and 7 August 1987. The residents of Vevƒçani defied the decision of the Yugoslavian government to redirect water from the springs to Struga. They were at odds with the government's attempts to have the inhabitants of Struga using what they saw as their water. Police were assembled twice in the village before the situation was resolved. The residents had sparked calls for democracy and freedom from the Yugoslavia government. A \\"Republic of Vevƒçani\\" had been planned by the residents. =Republic of Vevƒçani and the Vevƒçani Liƒçnik= After the fall of Communism, as a bid to attract more tourism to the village, the residents of Vevƒçani voted to create an independent republic . The \\"Republic of Vevƒçani\\" () was soon founded. As a part of the self-styled \\"Independent Republic of Vevƒçani\\" declared in 2002, the \\"Vevƒçani Liƒçnik\\" () was created as souvenir currency for the area. The \\"Liƒçnici\\" (plural) come in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000.

The process of creating the GA of Vevƒçani is very broad, based on the work of the wide community and involves citizens that participate in the creating of the document and by doing that they influence on the decision making process in the community. For the first time in Macedonia, the citizens have the opportunity directly to influence the process of decision making, to create partner relations with the local government and business sector in order to achieve benefits for the community. =Religion= Vevƒçani is home to the Parish of Vevƒçani which also includes the villages of Oktisi and Gorna Belica. For centuries the village has been a Christian village surrounded by many Muslim villages. The village is home to 19 Churches, Monasteries and Chapels.

A native of Hinckley, a village in Trenton, New York, he was listed as tall and . Schumacher was still an undergraduate at St. Lawrence University when he first signed with the Giants in 1931. He required only eight games of minor league seasoning before earning a place on the Giants' pitching staff in 1932. The following year (during which he received his degree from St. Lawrence), Schumacher helped pitch the Giants to the 1933 National League pennant and World Series championship. His 19 victories, 258 innings pitched, 21 complete games, seven shutouts and 2.16 earned run average were second on the staff only to Carl Hubbell, the future Baseball Hall of Fame left-hander. During the 1933 fall classic, he started two games against the Washington Senators and won Game 2, 6‚Äì1, turning in a complete game, five-hit effort and driving in three runs himself. He also started the clinching Game 5, and departed in the sixth inning with the score tied, 3‚Äì3. Adolfo Luque came on in relief and was the winning pitcher, as the Giants triumphed 4‚Äì3 in extra innings. Schumacher won 23 games in 1934, his best season. From 1933‚Äì35, he was 61‚Äì31 with 12 shutouts, but after their 1933 title, the Giants finished in arrears of the St. Louis Cardinals (1934) and Chicago Cubs (1935). Then the Giants won back- to-back NL pennants in 1936 and 1937. Schumacher's regular-season record was only 24‚Äì25, but he drew three more starting assignments in World Series play. In 1936, he started two games against the heavy-hitting New York Yankees. He dropped Game 2, exiting with none out in the third inning and charged with four runs against in an eventual 18‚Äì4 Yankee rout. Then he started Game 5 and held the Yanks to three earned runs in ten innings. His 5‚Äì4 victory kept the Giants' hopes alive, but they were eliminated in Game 6 by the Yankees, who were en route to four straight world championships. A year later, Schumacher started Game 3 of the 1937 World Series and lost a 5‚Äì1 decision. He continued to take a turn in the Giants' starting rotation from 1938‚Äì42, then entered the United States Navy, serving in the Pacific Theatre of Operations, and missed three full seasons during World War II. Schumacher came back briefly in 1946 and won his first two starts, pitching complete games in each. But he worked infrequently after mid-June and retired at the close of the season. During his career, Schumacher posted a 158‚Äì121 won-lost record, with 329 starting assignments. He registered 137 complete games and 26 shutouts and added seven saves during his infrequent bullpen appearances. In 2,482 innings pitched, he allowed 2,424 hits and 902 bases on balls. He fanned 906 and compiled a lifetime ERA of 3.36. In World Series action, he went 2‚Äì2 (4.13), allowing 35 hits and 19 walks in 32 innings pitched; he struck out 17. An accomplished batsman among pitchers, batting .202 (181-for-896), he slugged 15 home runs lifetime, six of them in 1934. Defensively he was also above average, recording a .971 fielding percentage which was 11 points higher than the league average at his position. Schumacher was selected to the National League squad for two of the first three All-Star games ever played, including the maiden 1933 midsummer classic. He did not appear in that contest, but returned to the NL All-Star team in 1935 and hurled four innings of one-run ball in the American League's 4‚Äì1 victory at Cleveland Stadium.

They are listed by the type of controversy they were involved in. Nudity and sexuality * Alice Cooper ‚Äì Love It to Death (1971)  The album features a portrait of the original Alice Cooper band, with frontman Alice Cooper posed with his thumb protruding from underneath his cape as if it were his penis. The album was later reissued with Cooper's entire right arm airbrushed out of the photograph. * Arca ‚Äì Xen (2014)  The album cover is a computer-generated androgynous alter-ego named Xen. With her head tilted back, Xen displays her broad shoulders, breasts, and large hips on the album cover with her skin rippling \\"as if about to peel and fall off.\\" Even though no genitals appear, Spotify and iTunes pixelate the area, as well as the breasts. * Biffy Clyro ‚Äì The Vertigo of Bliss (2003)  The cover shows a woman sitting down with her hand up her dress, presumably masturbating, with a look of pleasure on her face. The controversy of the album cover is accompanied by the erotic artwork of the singles \\"The Ideal Height\\", \\"Questions and Answers\\" and \\"Eradicate the Doubt\\" (all designed by Milo Manara). Despite being considered offensive and sexist by some, ShortList magazine praised the band for their bravery and originality when they mentioned it in their list of \\"50 Coolest Album Covers Ever\\". * The Black Crowes ‚Äì Amorica (1994)  The album cover's depiction of pubic hair, taken from an issue of Hustler magazine, caused controversy. The image was replaced with a black background cover which blacked out the hair. * Blind Faith ‚Äì Blind Faith (1969)  The cover featured a topless pubescent girl, holding in her hands a silver space ship, which some perceived as phallic.

However, the artwork was rejected because record executives feared that the dominant record store chains at the time would not sell the album with a sexist cover, or Jon Bon Jovi's complaint that the record company had put a bright pink border around the photograph that the band had submitted. Instead, the cover was changed before the album's release to an image of a wet garbage bag with the words \\"Slippery When Wet\\" written on it. * Bow Wow Wow ‚Äì See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy! (1981)  The cover of the album features a rendition of √âdouard Manet‚Äôs painting Le D√©jeuner sur l‚Äôherbe featuring the band members.

Although the trial and two years of subsequent litigation in the case did not result in any convictions, Alternative Tentacles and the band's frontman Jello Biafra were nearly driven into bankruptcy as a result of costs related to the trial and litigation. Additionally, the album's actual cover ‚Äì a 1970s Newsweek photograph of Shriners in a parade ‚Äì prompted a 1986 lawsuit from the four elderly Shriners included in the photograph. * Death Grips ‚Äì No Love Deep Web (2012)  The cover shows the erect penis of drummer Zach Hill with the album's title written in black marker.

After several music retailers refused to stock the album, the label compromised and moved the offending image to the inside sleeve, replacing it with a new image depicting a cross and skulls of the five band members.

Clarke, features a group of naked children ascending the Giant's Causeway.

Considered more odd than evil or sexual, the album generated controversy and was later replaced with a censored version that just showed the model's eyes.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/banned-in-the-u- s-a-20-wildest-censored-album-covers-154101/janes-addiction-ritual-de-lo- habitual-1990-44603/ * Red Hot Chili Peppers ‚Äì Mother's Milk (1989)  The album cover features a black and white photograph of the band sprawled across the arms of a proportionately larger naked woman. A rose conceals one of her nipples while singer Anthony Kiedis' standing body conceals the other. Several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity. A stricter censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original.Apter, 2004. pp. 196‚Äì197 * Rob Zombie ‚Äì Mondo Sex Head (2012)  The cover features a nude female's buttocks, but after controversy arose, it was replaced by an image of a cat, which was referred to as a \\"pussy shot\\". * Roger Waters ‚Äì The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984)  The cover features a rear-view and nude image of model and pornography actress Linzi Drew. It was condemned by many feminist groups and was also accused of promoting rape. Columbia Records was forced to place a black box covering the nudity for future releases to avoid more controversy. * Roxy Music ‚Äì Country Life (1974)  The album features scantily clad models Constanze Karoli and Eveline Grunwald ‚Äì the sister and girlfriend, respectively, of Can guitarist Michael Karoli ‚Äì posed in front of a bush. Although no nudity is directly shown in the photograph, Grunwald is topless and Karoli's bra is translucent, allowing her nipples and areolae to be visible. Consequently, the album's LP sleeve was packaged in a green outer nylon bag; for a later American release of the album, the front cover was replaced by mirroring the photograph on the album's back cover, which features the foliage and forest, but neither woman. * Scorpions ‚Äì Virgin Killer (1976)  This cover featured a photo of a naked prepubescent girl, with her pubic area partially obscured by a \\"cracked glass\\" effect. Her pose and the title \\"Virgin Killer\\" added to the image's notoriety. The Internet Watch Foundation, a British non-profit group who provides content blacklists for major ISPs in the country, also notably blacklisted pages on Wikipedia for featuring the cover on its article about the album. This block was later retracted due to technical problems which occurred as a result of the blocking mechanisms and due to the already \\"wide availability\\" of the image. * Suede ‚Äì Suede (1993)  The gender-ambiguous cover art provoked controversy in the press,\\"Past Mercury Music Prize winners\\". Metro. Retrieved on 3 September 2009. prompting Suede frontman Brett Anderson to comment, \\"I chose it because of the ambiguity of it, but mostly because of the beauty of it.\\" The cover image of the androgynous kissing couple was taken from the 1991 book Stolen Glances: Lesbians Take Photographs edited by Tessa Boffin and Jean Fraser. The photograph was taken by Tee Corinne and in its entirety shows a woman kissing an acquaintance in a wheelchair.Barnett, p. 114 * The Strokes ‚Äì Is This It (2001)  The original cover art featured a photograph of a woman's nude bottom and hip, with a leather-gloved hand suggestively resting on it. Although British retail chains HMV and Woolworths objected to the photograph's controversial nature, they stocked the album without amendment. In the band's native United States, the cover was changed to a photograph of subatomic particle tracks in a bubble chamber. This decision was made by frontman Julian Casablancas because he liked this image more than the original cover, and was independent of any controversy or label demand. * Sky Ferreira ‚Äì Night Time, My Time (2013)  The album cover features Sky Ferriera appearing topless, wearing a cross necklace inside a shower, with a \\"demented\\" facial expression. The album cover was cropped for iTunes, and in-store versions had an elongated sticker with the album title and her name covering the explicit content. * Tin Machine ‚Äì Tin Machine II (1991)  The original cover featured a row of four nude Kouroi. In the U.S., the genitalia of the statues were airbrushed out, leading band member David Bowie to exclaim, \\"Only in America!\\"\\"Beaming Bowie excited about current direction of his life, music\\" by Patrick MacDonald, The Seattle Times, 20 December 1991 * Tool ‚Äì Undertow (1993)  Photos in the liner notes of a nude obese woman, a nude man of normal weight, a cow licking its genitals, and the band members with pins in the sides of their heads generated controversy, resulting in the album being removed from stores such as Kmart and Wal-Mart. The cover was later replaced by a giant bar code. * The Weeknd ‚Äì House of Balloons (2011) (Mixtape)  The explicit cover is a black- and-white image of a topless woman sitting in a tiled room surrounded and partially obscured by balloons. When the mixtape was sold separately for retail release on iTunes and in stores in 2015, the cover was censored. * White Zombie ‚Äì Supersexy Swingin' Sounds (1996)  The album's cover depicts a naked woman relaxing in a hammock in front of a driveway and a sidewalk. The edited version of the album (audio-wise) has the woman wearing a blue bikini. * Witchfinder General - Death Penalty (1982) and Friends of Hell (1983)  Both albums' covers feature model Joanne Latham in states of undress, being attacked or accosted by men in Medieval and Renaissance period attire. The original concept for Death Penalty was developed by Revolver Music founder Paul Birch. The negative press from the album covers was a large contributing factor in the breakup of the band. Religious * The Game ‚Äì Jesus Piece (2012)  The cover features a stained-glass image of an African-American Jesus wearing a red bandanna across his lower face, a Jesus piece necklace, and a teardrop tattoo. After the Roman Catholic Church called Interscope Records to complain about the image, Game decided to make this cover for the deluxe edition and use a different cover for the standard edition. The standard cover features a black-and-white photo of the rapper's deceased brother Jevon Danell Taylor, who died of gunshot wounds on May 21, 1995 at the age of 20. * The Jimi Hendrix Experience ‚Äì Axis: Bold as Love (1967)  Hindu groups in Malaysia expressed anger at both the David King illustrated poster and cover which shows Hendrix and his bandmates as the deity Vishnu. The Malaysian government's Home Ministry instituted a ban on the artwork in June 2014 to protect religious sensitivities. * Justin Bieber ‚Äì Purpose (2015)  An alternative cover was reportedly created by Justin Bieber's team for his Purpose album after several Muslim nations across the Middle East, North Africa as well as Indonesia, took issue with Bieber being shirtless in the original artwork and flaunting his cross tattoo, promoting Christianity. * Marilyn Manson - Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) (2000)  The cover depicts Manson as a crucified Christ with his jawbone torn off; a statement on censorship and America's obsession with martyrs. The album was sold at Circuit City only after it was housed in a cardboard sleeve featuring an alternative cover, while Walmart and Kmart refused to stock the album at all. A pastor in Memphis, Tennessee also threatened to go on a hunger strike unless the album was pulled from shelves. * Slayer ‚Äì Christ Illusion (2006)  The cover depicts a mutilated, stoned Christ in a sea of blood with mutilated heads. For stores who refused to sell the album with the original cover, an alternative cover was provided instead. In India, Joseph Dias, general secretary of the Mumbai Christian group Catholic Secular Forum, took \\"strong exception\\" to the original album artwork, and issued a memorandum to Mumbai's police commissioner in protest. As a result, all Indian stocks were recalled and destroyed. * Steve Taylor ‚Äì I Predict 1990 (1987)  The album's cover, influenced by early 20th century French neo-impressionist poster art and painted by Taylor's wife, was controversial with some Christian retailers who instead believed it to be a reference to tarot and New Age philosophy. The album was pulled from several stores as a result. Further controversy was raised by the album track \\"I Blew Up the Clinic Real Good\\", which condemned anti-abortion violence. Some Christian bookstores which did not pull the album for its cover pulled it due to the song or its title, either because its critique of the pro-life movement offended store owners and customers, or because these same individuals missed the song's satirical point, and believed Taylor advocated such violence.Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music; Powell; p931; Hendrickson Publishers; paperback edition (August 2002) * Tenacious D ‚Äì Tenacious D (2001)  The album cover received controversy due to its parody of the Devil tarot card. On the back of the CD were two babies locked to Satan. This caused the album to be pulled from many stores and in later US copies of the CD the babies were airbrushed out. Though for the July 2002 CD release of the album in the UK and also the 2013 re-release on vinyl, the babies were kept in. Copyright infringement * The Beautiful South ‚Äì Miaow (1994)  The album was originally set to feature a photo of rows of dogs seated in a music hall with a gramophone on the stage. However, retailer HMV made the band withdraw it as it mocked their trademark dog, and the band put out a new cover, depicting four dogs in a boat.Beautifulsouth.org, March 1995 Retrieved on 10 June 2007 * Bob Dylan ‚Äì Blonde on Blonde (1966)  The original inside gatefold featured nine black-and-white photos, including a shot of actress Claudia Cardinale that Dylan selected from Jerry Schatzberg's portfolio. Since it had been used without her authorization, Cardinale's photo was subsequently removed, making the original record sleeve a collector's item. * Crystal Castles ‚Äì Alice Practice EP (2006)  The cover of the EP features artwork by Trevor Brown of Madonna with a black eye. Brown sued the band, claiming that they had used his work without permission. In 2008, Brown and the band came to a settlement in which he was paid for the rights to the image. * Gob ‚Äì Green Beans and Almonds (1995)  The album features a picture of the Green Giant standing in front of long green beans. The company sued Gob for the use of the mascot because it is a trademark of the company. * King Crimson ‚Äì Discipline (1981)  The Celtic knot featured on the original album cover is derivative of a copyrighted design by George Bain and was used without Bain's permission. The band did not know about the copyright problem and elected to commission a new knotwork for later reissues of the record. * Matchbox Twenty ‚Äì Yourself or Someone Like You (1996)  The album's cover depicts a man with glasses wearing a shirt on his left shoulder and a pilot hat. Frank Torres, the man featured on the cover image sued the band in May 2005, claiming Matchbox Twenty had no permission from him to use his photo on the album's cover and that the photo had been the cause of mental anguish. Torres justified the delay in suing Matchbox Twenty by claiming he had only seen the album photo within the last two years.Matchbox Twenty sued over album cover . Retrieved 14 November 2007. * Negativland ‚Äì U2 (1991)  The cover features the album title, \\"U2\\", as a very large logo, with the band's name in small text beneath the album. Island Records sued the band for the use of the misleading album cover because \\"U2\\" is the trademark of the label. The songs on the album were controversial too, as they were versions of U2's song \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" which were copied without permission. * Richard Pryor ‚Äì Richard Pryor (1968)  The debut album of comedian Richard Pryor was recorded live at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. The cover was art-directed and designed by Gary Burden. According to Burden, \\"As a result of the Richard Pryor album cover, which I loved doing, I got two letters: One was a letter from the National Geographic Society‚Äôs attorneys offering to sue me for defaming their publication. The second letter was a Grammy nomination for the best album cover.\\"Richard Pryor  Gary Burden For R. Twerk & Co. . * The Rolling Stones ‚Äì Some Girls (1978)  The original pressing of the album featured an inner sleeve containing many black and white photos of both the band members as well as other celebrities, all strategically positioned to show through cut-out holes on the outer sleeve. After protests from some of the persons depicted, the inner sleeve was revised to replace the offending photos with color blocks and text reading Pardon Our Appearance and Cover Under (Re)Construction. * Sonic Youth ‚Äì Sister (1987)  The album's artwork has been edited two separate times to obscure images; the first of which was a Richard Avedon image depicting a 12-year-old girl, due to a lawsuit threat. The other instance was when an image of the Disney Magic Kingdom was deliberately covered with a barcode, likely due to copyright complaints.Sister (Sonic Youth album)#Packaging * Sufjan Stevens ‚Äì Illinois (2005)  Shortly after the release of the album, reports arose that DC Comics had issued a cease and desist letter to Stevens' label Asthmatic Kitty because of the depiction of Superman on the cover., However, on October 4, 2005, Asthmatic Kitty announced that there had been no cease and desist letter; the record company's own lawyers had warned about the copyright infringement. On June 30, 2005, Asthmatic Kitty's distributor Secretly Canadian asked its retailers not to sell the album; however, it was not recalled. On July 5, the distributor told its retailers to go ahead and sell their copies, as DC Comics agreed to allow Asthmatic Kitty to sell the copies of the album that were already manufactured, but the image was removed from subsequent pressings. Soon after it was made public that the cover would be changed, copies of the album featuring Superman were sold for as high as $75 on eBay. On the vinyl edition released on November 22, 2005, Superman's image is covered by a balloon sticker. The image of the balloon sticker was also used on the cover of the Compact Disc and later printings of the double vinyl release. * Tad ‚Äì 8-Way Santa (1991)  The original cover featured a photograph of a man and woman which had been found in a thrift store. The couple on the album sued for unauthorized use of their image and the cover was replaced on later pressings. * U2 ‚Äì No Line on the Horizon (2009)  The cover image, Boden Sea by Hiroshi Sugimoto, had previously been used by Richard Chartier and Taylor Deupree for their 2006 album Specification.Fifteen. Deupree called U2's cover \\"nearly an exact rip-off\\" and stated that for the band to obtain the rights to the image it was \\"simply a phone call and a check.\\"https://www.webcitation.org/5kjDg3ppi?url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?mode=getarticle&file;=fa20090320a1.html Sugimoto refuted both of these claims, calling the use of the same photograph a coincidence and stating that no money was involved in the deal with U2. * Vampire Weekend ‚Äì Contra (2010)  The cover art, taken in the 1980s, features a blond girl staring into the camera with an unidentifiable expression on her face. In July 2010, the band and their label were sued by the model, Kirsten Kennis. Kennis claimed photographer Tod Scott Brody, who sold the image to the band, did not take the picture and she was not aware her image was being used until she saw the copy her teenage daughter had bought. Vampire Weekend also sued Brody, arguing that he was liable for any damages in the Kennis case due to misrepresentation on his part. Kennis and Vampire Weekend amicably settled their lawsuit in August 2011. However, the model and the band continued to pursue litigation against Brody. * The Velvet Underground ‚Äì The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967)  Shortly after its release, the band and their label Verve Records were threatened with a lawsuit by Warhol superstar Eric Emerson, whose image is projected upside-down on the back cover of the album. Copies of the album were withdrawn from sale so the image could be censored by a large sticker. The image was restored on the 1996 compact disc release of the album. Violence * The Beatles ‚Äì Yesterday and Today (1966)  In early 1966, photographer Robert Whitaker had the Beatles in the studio for a conceptual art piece titled A Somnambulant Adventure. For the shoot, Whitaker took a series of pictures of the group dressed in butchers' coats and draped with pieces of meat and body parts from plastic baby dolls. The group played along as they were tired of the usual photo shoots‚ÄîLennon recalled the band having \\"boredom and resentment at having to do another photo session and another Beatles thing\\"‚Äîand the concept was compatible with their own black humour.The Beatles.

The Beatles Anthology, San Francisco, CA: Chronicle Books LLC. , 204‚Äì205 Although not originally intended as an album cover, the Beatles submitted photographs from the session for their promotional materials. Capitol Records president Alan W. Livingston recalled that his principal contact was with Paul McCartney, who pushed strongly for the photo to be used as the album cover and described it as \\"our comment on the [Vietnam] war\\". A photograph of the band smiling amid the mock carnage was used as promotional advertisements for the British release of the \\"Paperback Writer\\" single. In the United States, Capitol printed approximately 750,000 copies of Yesterday and Today with the same photograph on the front cover.Schaffner, Nicholas. (1977). The Beatles Forever, Harrisburg, PA: Cameron House. , 55 Reaction was immediate, as many dealers refused to stock the LP. The record was immediately recalled, in what Capitol termed \\"Operation Retrieve\\"; all copies were ordered shipped back to the record label for a replacement cover image, leading to its rarity and popularity among collectors. * Cannibal Corpse ‚Äì Various albums (1990‚Äì2006)  Death metal band Cannibal Corpse's albums were all banned from Germany until 2006 due to their graphic album covers and disturbing lyrics. The band was also forbidden to play any songs from those albums while touring in Germany. This prohibition was not lifted until June 2006. In an interview from 2004, George Fisher attempted to recall what originally provoked the ban: \\"A woman saw someone wearing one of our shirts, I think she is a schoolteacher, and she just caused this big stink about it. So [now] we can't play anything from the first three records. And it really sucks because kids come up and they want us to play all the old songs ‚Äî and we would ‚Äî but they know the deal. We can't play 'Born in a Casket' but can play 'Dismembered and Molested.\\" * Mayhem - The Dawn of the Black Hearts (1993)  A bootleg live-album released by Warmaster Records which showed a real life photograph of the band's late vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin's corpse after he committed suicide by cutting his wrists and throat before shooting himself in the head with a shotgun. The photograph was taken by the band's guitarist √òystein Aarseth after returning home to find his body. He immediately went to a store for a camera and sent photographs of the body and pieces of Ohlin's skull to people in the Norwegian black metal scene he deemed \\"worthy\\". One of these people happened to be Mauricio Montoya Botero the owner of Warmaster Records who released a bootleg live album with one of the pictures as the album cover. It was subsequently reissued by various other labels over the years. The concert was later released officially by the band as \\"Live in Sarpsborg\\" (2017) without the controversial album cover.

Venice, CA: Feral House 1998, pp. 59f. * CKY ‚Äì Volume 1 (1999)  The cover originally depicted a stylized cartoon depiction of R. Budd Dwyer's live television suicide. After many complaints of offensiveness, the label forced the band to replace the offensive cover with a black and white cut-out of one of the band's live performances. The album was released with the band's original name Camp Kill Yourself, which was switched to CKY. * The Coup ‚Äì Party Music (2001)  The original cover art, designed in June 2001, depicted Boots Riley and Pam the Funkstress destroying the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. After the September 11 attacks, the group postponed the album's release until November of that year, with the record now sporting an alternate cover depicting a hand holding a flaming martini glass. * Green Day ‚Äì Kerplunk (1992)  The cover features a white picture (with some green added in) of a teenage girl wearing a flower shirt holding a smoking gun. The back cover features a boy lying on the ground with a gunshot wound on his back. Retail stores such as Walmart and Kmart initially refused to carry Kerplunk. The band saw continued controversy on their next album Dookie. * Green Day ‚Äì Dookie (1994)  The cover art shows an animated picture of dogs throwing bombs and dirt on people and buildings and a huge explosion with the band's name on top of the cloud. A blimp on the left in the sky says \\"Bad Year\\" (possibly a parody of the Goodyear Blimp) and on the right is a man with a harp in a cloud. Retailers Walmart and Kmart refused to sell the album because of this. Despite the controversy, no alternative cover has existed. However, later printings of the album edited the back cover for copyright reasons, airbrushing out a puppet of Ernie from Sesame Street. * Ice-T ‚Äì Home Invasion (1993)  The album's cover depicted a white boy listening to rap music in the midst of a home invasion in which Blacks are attacking Whites (presumably the boy's parents). Sire Records, owned by Time Warner, refused to release the album with the cover, and Ice-T left the label as a result.The Ice Opinion, Ice-T as dictated to Heidi Siegmund, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1994 *KMD - Black Bastards (2001)  The controversial cover art, which shows a Sambo figure hanging from a gallow, reportedly caused Elektra Records to shelve the album and drop the grouphttps://www.allmusic.com/artist/kmd-mn0000296750/biography https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2014/11/06/361216399/a-rational- conversation-the-20-year-old-album-thats-mf-dooms-missing-link * Lynyrd Skynyrd ‚Äì Street Survivors (1977)  The original cover sleeve for Street Survivors had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, standing in the street of a town engulfed in flames. Three days after the album was released, three of the band members were killed in a plane crash due to fuel exhaustion. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve Gaines' widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background. Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original \\"flames\\" cover was restored. * Manic Street Preachers ‚Äì Journal for Plague Lovers (2009)  The album art depicts a painting by Jenny Saville. A number of UK supermarkets deemed the red/ochre colours on the portrait to be blood, and therefore used alternative packaging to stock the item.Manic Street Preachers album cover censored by supermarkets The Guardian, 15 May 2009 The alternative packaging in question is a longbox, a type of outer packaging used for some CDs in the 1980s and early to mid-1990s. * Metallica ‚Äì Kill 'Em All (1983)  The album was originally set to be titled Metal Up Your Ass, with the cover featuring a toilet bowl with a hand clutching a dagger emerging from it. However, at the request of Megaforce Records (who thought the original album title would be inappropriate), the band changed the album title to Kill 'Em All. They also changed the artwork, this time depicting a shadow of a hand releasing a bloodied hammer. * The Offspring ‚Äì The Offspring (1989)  The album's original artwork depicted an image of a man's body exploding as the xenomorph from the Alien franchise holding a Stratocaster guitar emerges from his chest. The album was reportedly banned for being \\"too grotesque\\", and on the 1995 reissue, the artwork was replaced by a blurry black-and-white picture of a man. It was later admitted that the band and their studio never really liked the original artwork. * Pink Floyd ‚Äì Wish You Were Here (1975)  The artwork depicts two men shaking hands in an alley at Warner Bros. Studios, with one on fire. As some retailers deemed it \\"too violent\\" and refused to sell the album, the LP sleeve was packaged in a black nylon outer bag adorned by a \\"four elements\\" sticker; this method of censorship was chosen as a deliberate nod to Roxy Music's Country Life, which was similarly given a nylon outer bag due to objections towards its cover art. Some later re-releases replace the original cover art entirely with a black background featuring the four-elements emblem, mimicking the appearance of the nylon bag. Other reasons * Arctic Monkeys ‚Äì Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006)  The cover sleeve showing Chris McClure, a friend of the band, smoking a cigarette, was criticised by the head of the NHS in Scotland for \\"reinforcing the idea that smoking is OK\\".BBC News:Arctic Monkeys defend album cover Retrieved on 5 June 2006 The image on the CD itself is a shot of an ashtray full of cigarettes. The band's product manager denied the accusation, and in fact suggested the opposite ‚Äî \\"You can see from the image smoking is not doing him the world of good\\". * Joy Division ‚Äì An Ideal for Living (1978)  The cover has a black-and-white picture of a blond Hitler Youth member beating a drum, which was drawn by guitarist Bernard Sumner (called \\"Bernard Albrecht\\" on the poster sleeve) and the words \\"Joy! Division\\" printed in a blackletter font. The cover design, coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled controversy over whether the band had Nazi sympathies. When the EP was re-released on 12-inch vinyl, the original cover was replaced by artwork featuring scaffolding. * The Mamas and the Papas ‚Äì If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears (1966)  The album cover, which features the four members in a bathtub, also featured a toilet in the far right corner. The inclusion of this toilet was controversial for the time and copies with the cover were pulled due to complaints of indecency. The copies were re-issued with a text- box pasted on top of the toilet. Later issues of the album feature both the toilet and the bathtub cropped out entirely. * Nirvana ‚Äì In Utero (1993)  When In Utero was released, there were many objections to the song \\"Rape Me\\", despite the band's claims that the lyrics were \\"anti-rape.\\" Retailers Wal-Mart and Kmart refused to sell the album because of the back cover artwork (featuring model fetuses), so a \\"clean\\" version was released for them which featured an altered version of the back cover and listed the title \\"Rape Me\\" as \\"Waif Me\\", though the song remained unchanged.Nirvana fan club FAQ Retrieved on 10 June 2006Banned albums of the 90s Retrieved on 10 June 2006 The band acquiesced to the demands to change the artwork because members Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic were only able to buy music from the two chain stores as children; as a result they wanted to \\"make their music available to kids who don't have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores\\".Gordinier, Jeff. \\"Attention Kmart Shoppers \\".

Houston's family stated they found the artwork \\"disgusting and disrespectful\\". * The Rolling Stones ‚Äì Beggars Banquet (1968)  The original album cover featured a toilet wall which had been defaced. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards defaced the toilet wall themselves. The album cover was rejected by Decca, and kept out of shops until a new album cover was designed. * Van Halen ‚Äì Balance (1995)  The cover in most markets features two nude conjoined twins sitting on a teeter-totter. The cover was altered in some markets, including Japan, to remove one of the twins entirely from the photograph.

It is a coastal town on the Mediterranean Sea. Its population in 2008 was 56,398.populstat.info The original name is thought to be bou-dhou-aou, Arabic for illuminator in reference to a small insect the size of a beetle which at night shows beautiful brilliant green light in its tail. Archaeology The wilaya of Boumerdes represents an archaeological treasure by the multitude of historical sites that its vast territory of 1 456,16 km2 shelters. Several prehistoric vestiges were discovered during the period of occupation. With the arrival of the colonizers and the project of colonization on the lands of Boudouaou, many prehistoric vestiges under the occupation were discovered: rhinoceros bones house in the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris, a bronze axe, flint Retouched and prehistoric arrows are examples of discoveries already made. Boudouaou is located on medium-altitude terrain that forms the current low Kabylie-Arabo- Musulmane, of which the town of Boumerdes is the chief town. The mausoleum of Blad Guitoun, in the commune of Si Mustapha, is an illustrative example of the archaeological sites which were still apparent in low Arab-Muslim kabylie, at the beginning of the French colonization from 1837. The B√©nian nt√¢a Soum√¢a, in the commune of Th√©nia, is another archaeological site that had been marvelously preserved until the middle of the 19th century. The Berber, Roman and Turkish Arab populations who lived around these archaeological sites before French colonization preserved this cultural and identity heritage. The location of these archaeological sites on the banks and banks of Wadi Isser and Wadi S√©baou, as well as on the Mediterranean coast, makes it possible to classify the wilaya of Boumerd√®s among the rich archaeological niches in Algeria. During the past centuries, the various floods and floods of the Wadi Isser and Wadi S√©baou (wadis of Lower Kabylie) caused the overflow of these rivers and buried the numid cities under the silt and the mud Carried by the torrents. Indeed, under a depth of about 3 meters, several discoveries in the wilaya of Boumerd√®s, of which numerous remains and archaeological sites, were uncovered in 2009. In the village of Beni H'mida, in the commune of Leghata, retains a statue found alongside a metal dish, relics of pottery and human bones. A pitcher containing more than 900 silver coins engraved in the name of \\"Bolokine Abderrahmane\\", was discovered in Ouriacha village, in the commune of Naciria (La√¢ziv Za√¢moum).

He played for the New York Yankees from 1947 to 1951 and the Washington Senators from 1952 to 1955. He was known as \\"The Naugatuck Nugget\\" as a result of being from Naugatuck, Connecticut, and was named as such by Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen, and was nicknamed \\"Spec\\" because of his freckles. Biography Shea originally signed with the Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1940. He spent the 1940 season playing in Amsterdam, winning 11 and losing four while pitching 137 innings. In 1941, he was promoted to Norfolk, where he struck out 154 in 199 innings, and in 1942 he played in Kansas City, where he improved upon his earned run average. He was a member of the United States Armed Forces, serving in World War II. He joined in 1943 and served for three years, where he served solely as a soldier and did not play baseball. He was promoted to the Yankees' major league roster at the start of the 1947 New York Yankees season, and made his debut on April 19, 1947. He made his debut against the Boston Red Sox, which was so looked forward to at Naugatuck High School, his alma mater, that the school suspended operations for the day because most of the student body went to New York to root for Spec. As a rookie, Shea played in his first and only All-Star Game, playing in the 1947 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In the game, Shea pitched the 4th, 5th, and 6th innings, relieving for Hal Newhouser. He allowed one earned run, and was declared the winning pitcher of the All-Star Game. The same year, MLB established the Rookie of the Year Award. In the middle of the season, however, Shea was sidelined for seven weeks due to a pulled neck muscle. Shea finished the season with a 14-5 record in 27 appearances, had the lowest hits allowed per nine innings pitched in the majors with 6.4, had the best win-loss record in the American League with .737%, threw 13 complete games, three shutouts, and had an ERA of 3.07. Shea was in the running for the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award, which went to Jackie Robinson. Shea finished third in voting behind Robinson and Larry Jansen, but would have won the award had the American and National Leagues had separate Rookie of the Year winners. In the 1947 World Series, Shea started games one, five and seven, winning the first two en route to the Yankees' World Series victory. From 1948 to 1951, however, Shea had a combined 15-16 record, continuing to pitch in pain due to a nagging neck injury suffered in 1947. Instead of it being arm trouble as the Yankees believed, it was an issue that was solved by Shea visiting a chiropractor during the winter before the 1951 New York Yankees season. On May 3, 1952, Shea was traded by the Yankees with Jackie Jensen, Jerry Snyder, and Archie Wilson to the Washington Senators for Irv Noren and Tom Upton. In 1952 he had an 11-7 record with a 2.93 ERA, and in 1953 he had a 12-7 record with a 3.94 ERA. He was used in his final two seasons primarily as a relief pitcher, and pitched his final major league game on August 27, 1955. As a hitter, Shea posted a .195 batting average (58-for-298) with 29 runs, 1 home run, 33 RBI and 19 bases on balls in 195 games pitched. Defensively, he recorded a .967 fielding percentage. Robert Redford called Shea during production of the film The Natural for pitching consultation, where he taught Redford how to pitch in an old-time style. Shea died in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 19, 2002, at the age of 81 after having heart valve replacement surgery.

Helped halt DiMaggio's hit streak Smith is remembered for being the starting pitcher who halted Joe DiMaggio's 56-consecutive-game hitting streak on July 17, 1941. DiMaggio grounded out twice to third baseman Ken Keltner, who made outstanding defensive plays in each case, and also drew a base on balls from Smith in three plate appearances. Then, in his final at bat, against relief pitcher Jim Bagby, Jr., DiMaggio bounced into a double play. His New York Yankees won the game, however, 4‚Äì3. Smith also is notable for having served as a nominal coach at age 25 on manager Bill Terry's New York Giants staff in 1933‚Äîthe year before Smith made his debut as an active player in the Major Leagues. In 1932, Smith had won 17 games in the Class B Piedmont League and was acquired by the Giants. But Terry, realizing he had no room on his 1933 pitching staff, decided to keep Smith on his ball club as a coach and batting practice pitcher, rather than risk losing him in the minor league draft. According to the Associated Press in a January 5, 1934, story, \\"Smith was tabbed as great prospect last spring, but Terry had so many experienced moundsmen to bank upon that there was no place for the young portsider. Rather than farm him out where he might have been grabbed by some rival club, the Giants elected to carry him as a coach.\\" The same story claims that the 1933 World Champion Giant hitters struggled against Smith's \\"wide breaking curves\\" whenever he was called upon to pitch batting practice. Smith made his Major League pitching debut on May 5, 1934, against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field and allowed one run in two innings pitched in relief of Freddie Fitzsimmons. Early life and career Born in Belleville, Illinois, the , Smith had a 17-year professional career. He helped the Giants win the 1936 and 1937 National League pennants and appeared in relief in the 1936 and 1937 World Series, both against the Yankees, allowing four earned runs in 3 innings pitched. He led the NL in shutouts (four) in 1936. Smith's best season was in 1943, when he was named to the American League All-Star team and finished 15th in voting for the AL MVP Award for having a 17‚Äì7 win‚Äìloss record in 29 games (27 started), 14 complete games, three shutouts, two games finished, one save, 208 innings pitched, 186 hits allowed, 74 runs allowed, 59 earned runs allowed, seven home runs allowed, 72 bases on balls, 72 strikeouts, 862 batters faced, a 2.55 earned run average and a 1.238 WHIP.

His father, the autonomous ruler of Egypt and Syria, designated him as his successor. When Ibn Tulun died in May 884, Khumarawayh succeeded him. After defeating an attempt to depose him, in 886 he managed to gain recognition of his rule over Egypt and Syria as a hereditary governor from the Abbasid Caliphate. In 893 the agreement was renewed with the new Abbasid Caliph, al-Mu'tadid, and sealed with the marriage of his daughter Qatr al-Nada to the Caliph. At the height of his power, Khumarawayh's authority expanded from the Byzantine frontier in Cilicia and the Jazira to Nubia. Domestically, his reign was marked by a prodigal squandering of funds on extravagant displays of wealth, construction of palaces, and the patronage of artists and poets. In combination with the need to maintain a sizeable professional army and guarantee its loyalty through rich gifts, this emptied the treasury by the end of his reign. Khumarawayh was murdered by a palace servant in 896, and was succeeded by his son Jaysh, who was deposed after a few months in favour of another son, Harun ibn Khumarawayh. The Tulunid state entered a period of turmoil and weakness, which culminated in its reconquest by the Abbasids in 904‚Äì905. Biography Khumarawayh was born at Samarra in 864. His father, Ahmad ibn Tulun, the son of a Turkish slave-soldier, was appointed governor of Egypt in 868. In 871 he expelled the caliphal fiscal agent and assumed direct control of Egypt's revenue, which he used to create an army of slave soldiers (ghilmƒÅn) of his own. Relying on this powerful force, and exploiting the rift between the increasingly powerless Caliph al-Mu'tamid and his brother and de facto regent al-Muwaffaq‚Äîin 882 al-Mu'tamid even tried to flee Samarra and seek refuge with Ibn Tulun‚Äîhe managed to gain control over Syria and the frontier zone with the Byzantine Empire (the Thugh≈´r), as well as parts of the Jazira up to Raqqa. =Succession and relations with the Abbasids= In 882, following a failed rebellion of his elder brother Abbas, who was \\"regarded as cruel and untrustworthy\\" (), Khumarawayh was named as his father's deputy in Egypt and heir-apparent. This position was confirmed by Ibn Tulun at the request of his generals shortly before his death on 10 May 884. With the backing of the Tulunid regime's elites, Khumarawayh's succession was smooth; Abbas was forced to acknowledge Khumarawayh, but was assassinated shortly after. Khumarawayh's accession was an important step in the gradual dissolution of the Abbasid Caliphate: as Thierry Bianquis explains, \\"this was the first time in Abbasid history with regard to the government of so large and rich a territory, that a wƒÅli, whose legitimacy derived from the caliph who had designated him, was succeeded openly by an amƒ´r who claimed his legitimacy by inheritance\\". In his last months, Ibn Tulun had sought to effect a reconciliation with al-Muwaffaq on the basis of the recognition of his authority over Egypt and Syria, but his death interrupted the negotiations. As Khumarawayh was young and untested, one of Ibn Tulun's senior generals, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Wasiti, encouraged the Abbasids to attack and recover control of the Tulunid territories. The generals Ishaq ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abi'l-Saj attacked the Tulunid domains in Syria. Damascus fell when its governor defected, but their initial gains were rapidly reversed. In the spring of 885, al-Muwaffaq's son Abu'l-Abbas (the future al-Mu'tadid) was sent to take charge of the invasion. He soon succeeded in defeating the Tulunids and forcing them to retreat to Palestine, but after a quarrel with Ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abi'l-Saj, the latter abandoned the campaign and withdrew their forces. At the Battle of Tawahin on 6 April, Khumarawayh confronted Abu'l-Abbas in person. The Abbasid prince was initially victorious, forcing Khumarawayh to flee, but was in turn defeated by the Tulunid general Sa'd al-Aysar and fled the battlefield, while much of his army was taken prisoner. Al-Aysar then tried to rebel in Damascus, but Khumarawayh swiftly suppressed his revolt and is said to have killed the rebel with his own hands. Khumarawayh continued to pursue a rapprochement with the Abbasid court: he treated the prisoners of war from Tawahin with exceptional clemency, giving them the choice of either staying in Egypt under his own service or returning to Iraq without ransom. This policy eventually led to the conclusion of an agreement in December 886, whereby Khumarawayh was recognized as governor over Egypt and Syria, with the right to be succeeded by his offspring, for a period of 30 years, in exchange for an unspecified annual tribute. Between 886 and 890, Khumarawayh went on to defeat Ibn Khundaj and receive the submission of the governor of the Jazira, Ibn Abi'l-Saj. At the same time, the governor of Tarsus, Yazaman al-Khadim, accepted Tulunid suzerainty, bringing the Cilician Thugh≈´r under Tulunid control as well. Map of the Tulunid domains towards the end of Khumarawayh's reign The accession of al-Mu'tadid in 892 brought a warming of relations with the Baghdad court. Recognizing that he could not defeat the Tulunids, the new Caliph instead opted to conciliate them: in spring 893, al-Mu'tadid reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous governor over Egypt and Syria, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 dinars and further 200,000 dinars in arrears, as well as the return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of Diyar Rabi'a and Diyar Mudar. In addition, the prestigious ·π≠irƒÅz factories in Alexandria and Fustat, which produced government banners and robes of honour, remained under caliphal control. In order to seal the pact, Khumarawayh offered his daughter, Qatr al- Nada as bride to one of the Caliph's sons, but al-Mu'tadid chose to marry her himself. Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue, which contrasted starkly with the impoverished caliphal court. The Tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry, a \\"wedding gift that was considered the most sumptuous in medieval Arab history\\" (Bianquis), and the lavish marriage ceremonies remained the stuff of folk legends in Egypt until well into the Ottoman period. =Domestic policies= The extravagant wedding shows Khumarawayh's famous frivolity with money‚Äîindeed it has been suggested that the whole affair was, in the words of the historian , \\"a calculated device on the part of the caliph to wreck the finances of his dangerously wealthy and powerful vassal\\". Eager to display his wealth, the Tulunid ruler also built numerous palaces for himself and his favourites, and engaged in famous displays of royal extravagance, such as a quicksilver-filled basin in which he was rocked to sleep on top of air-filled cushions, or the blue-eyed lion he kept as a pet at his court. In addition, according to the sources, Khumarawayh never rode the same horse twice. He was nevertheless also a generous patron of the arts, of scholars and of poets. One of his prot√©g√©s was the grammarian Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn Muslim, who was also tutor to his sons, while al-Qasim ibn Yahya al-Maryami wrote panegyrics in his honour. All of this came at a heavy price, however; by the time of his death, the Tulunid treasury (which reportedly had contained ten million gold dinars at the time of his accession) was empty, and the dinar had lost two-thirds of its value. His extravagance brought criticism from religious scholars and from contemporary and later historians alike. Domestically, his reign was one of \\"luxury and decay\\" (Hugh N. Kennedy), but also a time of relative tranquillity in Egypt as well as in Syria, a rather unusual occurrence for the period. Khumarawayh's main power base was the powerful army built by his father, much in the model of the Abbasids themselves after the establishment of a professional military under Caliph al-Mu'tasim. The Tulunid army was mostly composed of Turkish, Byzantine Greek (R≈´m), and black African (SudƒÅn) ghilmƒÅn, as well as a few Byzantine mercenaries. To them Khumarawayh added a special regiment, the al-mukhtƒÅra (\\"the elect, picked\\"), mostly drawn from the Bedouins of the eastern Nile Delta, an area of great importance as it controlled the route connecting Syria and Egypt. A thousand-strong unit made up of black Africans seems to have been a distinct sub-unit of the al- mukhtƒÅra. Despite the undoubted military talent and personal bravery he displayed after Tawahin, Khumarawayh never enjoyed Ibn Tulun's authority over the army. This led to a policy of buying their loyalty with sumptuous donatives, which further drained the treasury. As Hugh N. Kennedy comments, financial difficulties seem to have been inherent in the Abbasid model the Tulunids emulated, resulting from the \\"inability of the state to fund a large, mostly inactive army on a permanent basis\\". In an attempt to find the necessary funds, the fiscal administration was entrusted to Ali ibn Ahmad al- Madhara'i, marking the final rise of the al-Madhara'i family to a dominant position in the fiscal and government apparatus of Egypt for the next half- century. =Death and succession= Khumarawayh was killed on 18 January 896 by one of his servants, who had been conducting an affair with Khumarawayh's favourite wife. When Khumarawayh learned of this, the servant feared for his life, and organized a conspiracy which claimed the Tulunid ruler's life. After Khumarawayh's death, the Tulunid state entered a period of instability under his under-age heirs, with his son Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh being deposed and killed in November, in favour of his younger brother Harun ibn Khumarawayh (). Al-Mu'tadid swiftly took advantage of this: in 897 he extended his control over the border provinces of the Thugh≈´r; forced the Tulunids to hand back all of Syria north of Homs; and increased the annual tribute to 450,000 dinars in exchange for caliphal recognition of Harun. Over the next few years, the Tulunid domains continued to experience domestic turmoil coupled with an escalation of Qarmatian attacks, resulting in the defection of many Tulunid followers to the resurgent Caliphate. Finally, in 904‚Äì905 al-Mu'tadid's successor al-Muktafi invaded Egypt and reincorporated the country fully into the Abbasid empire.

A broadsheet version first appeared in 1790 and it received formal publication as number 199 in Francis Child's collection The English and Scottish Popular Ballads of 1882. History Although there had been traditional enmity between the Campbells and Ogilvys since at least the sixteenth century, their private feud intensified in 1638, when the two clans joined opposite sides in the National Covenant rebellion: Ogilvy supported the king, Charles I, and Campbell the rebels. When James Ogilvy raised a regiment of several hundred men and marched south to the king's aid, Archibald, claiming to act on behalf of the anti-royalist alliance, seized and destroyed the castle of Airlie and, according to some accounts, brutally raped James Ogilvy's wife, Margaret. Here the allegation is dismissed as \\"propaganda\\". The texts Child, collecting in the 1870s, found four broadly similar versions. These all describe how the castle was destroyed by fire after Lady Ogilvy refused to reveal the whereabouts of the family treasure. However other versions continued in oral circulation and the one reproduced here, with its bleak penultimate verse, was collected on 27 June 1955 in Fetterangus by Hamish Henderson and Peter Kennedy from Lucy Stewart: :It fell on a day, a bonny summer day, :When the corn was ripe and yellow, :That there fell oot a great dispute :Between Argyle aye and Airlie. :Lady Margaret looked o‚Äôer yon high castle wall, :And O but she sighed sairly. :She saw Argyle and a‚Äô his men :Come to plunder the bonny hoose o‚Äô Airlie. :\\"Come doun, come doun Lady Margaret,\\" he said. :\\"Come doun and kiss me fairly :Or gin the morning's clear daylight :I willna leave a standing stane in Airlie.\\" :\\"I‚Äôll no come doun, ye false Argyll, :Nor will I kiss thee fairly. :I wouldnae kiss the false Argyle :Though you wouldna leave a standin‚Äô stane in Airlie.\\" :\\"For if my gude lord had been at hame, :As he's awa‚Äô wi‚Äô Chairlie, :There wouldnae come a Campbell frae Argyle :Dare trod upon the bonny green o‚Äô Airlie.\\" :\\"For I hae bore him seven bonny sons, :The eighth yin has never seen his daddy :But if I had as mony ower again :They would all be men for Chairlie.\\" :But poor Lady Margaret was forced to come doun :And O but she sighed sairly :For their in front o‚Äô all his men :She was ravished on the bowlin‚Äô green o‚Äô Airlie. :\\"Draw your dirks, draw your dirks,\\" cried the brave Locheil. :\\"Unsheath your sword,\\" cried Chairlie, :\\"We‚Äôll kindle sic a lowe roond the false Argyle, :And licht it wi‚Äô a spark oot o‚Äô Airlie.\\" Given the numerous references to \\"Chairlie\\" and the allusion to \\"Locheil\\", the song has inevitably taken on additional layers of meaning, being understood to refer to Charles Edward Stuart and the 1745 rebellion long after the events at Airlie. Versions Alan Lomax included the song in his Classic Ballads of Britain and Ireland of 1961. It was sung by Belle Stewart, who learned the song from her 91-year-old uncle Henry MacDonald, and recorded by Peter Kennedy.

Description Army Training Units (ATU) are commanded and staffed by UK Army Reservists. Along with Regular Army Training Regiments (ATR), they provide Basic Training to Army Reserve recruits, except those joining 4 PARA. Reserves recruits are selected at an Army Recruit Selection Centre. They then undertake a short basic training course known as ‚Äòalpha', over four weekends or a residential week. The alpha course is followed by a 15.5-day residential 'bravo' course to achieve trained soldier status. These generic courses teach essential elements of the Regular Common Military Syllabus 2014 (CMS 14). Recruits will then attend Initial Trade Training courses as stipulated by their cap badge / Corps. The Honourable Artillery Company currently runs its own alpha course twice a year. Background ATUs were created as Regional Training Centres (RTC) - which were in turn created from Brigade Specialist Training Teams (STT) - to provide basic training and specialist courses for the UK Army Reserve (formerly the Territorial Army). They were originally commanded and administered by their local Regional Forces (RF) Brigade. From 2012 they were renamed Army Training Units and command of the ATUs passed to Initial Training Group (ITG), part of the Army Recruiting and Training Division (ARTD), now part of ARITC. ITG is responsible for all Army Basic Training, both Regular and Reserve, except Regular Standard Entry Infantry. In 2013-14, ATU South moved from Malta Barracks, Aldershot to Pirbright and was then closed, with its staff subsumed into 2 ATR (a Regular unit) as its Reserves-only D Company. ATUs were further rationalised in 2017, with two units amalgamating to become ATUs North and West. ATU West Midlands retained its location but was reduced to a training company of ATR Grantham (a Regular unit that solely trains Reserves). This rationalisation also meant the removal of specialist course delivery and the deletion of the 'S' Companies at the ATUs (and hence the amalgamations).

Prelude to the IDF cross-border attack Israel's rationale for the cross-border assault was to avenge three Israeli deaths in a land mine incident on 12 November 1966, based on the Israeli allegation that the attack had originated from Jordan. A further goal in the operation was to demolish houses in Palestinian villages located south of Hebron as a show of force to preempt future Palestinian violence.Tom Segev. 1967. New York: Metropolitan Books, 2007. pp.150‚Äì152. The Israeli rationale for the attack on Samu has often been questioned. For example, Colonel (ret.) Jan M√ºhren, a Dutch UN observer in the West Bank who patrolled Samu during this period, gave an interview to Dutch current affairs program Nova on the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War where he denied the Israeli charges regarding Samu. He said \\"Had the people from this village anything to do with the attack on Israel ‚Äì Well no. Not just from this village but also not from the entire West Bank. ... only western officers operated here and we did patrols. The situation was completely calm.\\" However, the attack against the Israeli patrol had occurred two days earlier, although the purported Jordanian origin of the perpetrators was never independently investigated.UN Security Council ‚Äì Thirteen hundred and Twentieth Meeting. 16 November 1966. Document reference S/PV.1320 Jordan immediately lodged a formal complaint with the UN Security Council.Letter dated 14 November 1966 from the Permanent Representative of Jordan. UN symbol reference S/7586 Although the Israeli goal was retribution for the Fatah land mine incident, purportedly having originated from Jordanian-controlled territory, Israel's first act was to cross the 1949 Armistice line and to destroy a Jordanian police post at Rujm El Madfa. U.N. report by the Secretary General concerning incident of 13 November 1966 in Jordan. Retrieved 1 Oct 7. In addition to the large-scale destruction in Samu village, the Israeli forces also damaged other villages. In a report by the Arab League, it was assumed that the main goal of this attack was to test the efficiency of what was called the United Arab Command, and see if any other Arab country such as Egypt or Syria would come to the aid of Jordan. The report also assumes that this battle was in preparation for the Six-Day War.Arab League report Operation Shredder Israel mobilised a force of around 3,000‚Äì4,000 soldiers, backed by tanks and aircraft, in the attack code-named Operation Shredder. The force was divided into a large reserve force, which remained on the Israeli side of the border, and two attack forces, which crossed into the Jordanian-controlled West Bank. In what was justified as a retaliatory attack against Fatah, ground troops moved into the village of Rujm al-Madfa located just southwest of Hebron, and destroyed its police station. From there, the larger force of eight Centurion tanks followed by 400 paratroopers mounted in 40 open-topped half-tracks and 60 engineers in 10 more half-tracks headed for Samu. Meanwhile, the smaller force of three tanks and 100 paratroopers and engineers in 10 half-tracks headed toward two smaller villages, Khirbet el-Markas and Khirbet Jimba. When the larger force entered Samu, most of the town's residents responded to orders by the IDF to gather in the town square. Sappers from the 35th paratrooper brigades then dynamited numerous buildings within and near the village; reports of the total number of houses destroyed range from 40 to 125 (IDF and United Nations estimates, respectively). In addition the UN reported the destruction of the village medical clinic, a 6-classroom school and a workshop, plus damage to one mosque and 28 houses. The 48th Infantry Battalion of the Jordanian Army, commanded by Major Asad Ghanma, encountered the Israeli forces north-west of Samu. Two companies of the Hitteen Infantry Brigade (ŸÑŸàÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ÿßÿ© ÿ≠ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ) also approached from the north-east; these were composed of roughly 100 men and 20 convoy vehicles, and commanded by Col. Bahjat al-Muhaisen (ÿßŸÑÿπŸÖŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸÉŸÜ ÿ®Ÿáÿ¨ÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠Ÿäÿ≥ŸÜ). Believing that Israel was attacking Yattah, another village south of Hebron, rather than Samu, al-Muhaisen ordered his forces to advance towards Yattah. However, the road to Yattah passed directly through Samu, and as the Jordanian column entered the village, Israeli forces opened fire on it, destroying 15 of its 20 vehicles and forcing the Jordanians to retreat and regroup.Martin, Gilbert: Israel: A History Eight Jordanian Hawker Hunter jets were scrambled at Mafraq Airbase and attacked Israeli forces to relieve pressure on their own troops, but were met by a force of four Israeli Mirage 3 jets. In the air battle that followed, a Jordanian plane was shot down and the pilot was killed, and an Israeli plane was damaged and forced to land. Its pilot was severely injured. Col. Muheisen's column and a platoon of Jordanian soldiers armed with two 106 mm recoilless rifles launched a counterattack, and a three-hour battle ensued, after which the Israelis withdrew across the border. During the battle, sixteen Jordanian military personnel (15 soldiers and one pilot) were killed, and fifty-four other soldiers were wounded, including Colonel al-Muhaisen. One Israeli soldier was killed; Col. Yoav Shaham, the commander of the Israeli paratrooper battalion. Ten other Israeli soldiers were wounded. Three local civilians were also killed.Bowen, 2003, pp. 23‚Äì30.Oren, 2002, pp. 33‚Äì36. File:Samu Incident. II.jpgSamu 13 November 1966 File:Samu Incident. VI.jpgIsraeli army attack on Samu File:Samu Incident. IV.jpgSamu 13 November 1966 Aftermath Some authors consider the Battle of Samu to have been a contributing factor to the outbreak of the Six-Day War in 1967. Norman Finkelstein believed that it marked the onset of the crisis which culminated in the June 1967 war. Clea Bunch wrote that \\"the attack on Samu was the first link in a lengthy chain of miscalculations, false perceptions and high stakes gambles that steadily led to war\\". In Jordan, following the battle, King Hussein was faced with a storm of criticism for failing to protect Samu, emanating from Jordanians, as well as from Palestinians and neighboring Arab countries. Riots spread throughout the West Bank demanding the king be overthrown. Four Palestinians were killed by Jordanian police as a result of the riots. On 20 November, Hussein ordered nationwide military service.'King Husain orders nationwide military service', The Times, Monday, 21 November 1966; pg. 8; Issue 56794; col D. Egyptian and Syrian radio also verbally attacked Jordan accusing King Hussein of collaborating with the CIA to plot an overthrow of the Ba'ath Party in Syria. Following the Palestinian demonstrations against him, King Hussein accused Nasser of using the presence of the United Nations Emergency Force on Egypt's border with Israel, as an excuse for failing to take action against Israel.Brenchley, 1989, p. 147. As Palestinians rioted in Hebron, Nablus, Jerusalem on the West Bank and Irbid in Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization warned all Jordanian ministers to resign by noon on 26 November.'Unified Arab command criticizes Jordan's actions', The Times, 26 November 1966; pg. 6; Issue 56799; col D. In Israel, angered opposition parties demanded to know why Israel attacked Jordan rather than Syria, which was the guerrilla home base. In a special parliamentary debate, Prime Minister Eshkol listed 14 major acts of sabotage carried out from Jordan in the past year, climaxed by the land-mine explosion that killed three Israeli troops on 12 November. Eshkol said: \\"It is regrettable that this particular act of aggression came from Jordan.\\" But since it did, he had picked Jordan as his target. \\"No country where the saboteurs find shelter and through whose territory they pass on their way to Israel can be exempt from responsibility.\\" What Eshkol left unsaid was his certainty that, with the so-called Arab unity being what it was, Jordan would find itself with far less Arab support than Syria, which was much closer to Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser. Jordan's Arab partners did wait until the Israelis had withdrawn before making indignant vows of support.Middle East: Incident at Samu, Time, 25 November 1966 Two days after the attack, in a memo to President Johnson, his Special Assistant Walt Rostow wrote \\"I'm not suggesting our usual admonition against retaliation. We'll maintain that posture ... but retaliation is not the point in this case. This 3,000-man raid with tanks and planes was out of all proportion to the provocation and was aimed at the wrong target. In hitting Jordan so hard, the Israelis have done a great deal of damage to our interests and to their own: They've wrecked a good system of tacit cooperation between Hussein and the Israelis. ... They've undercut Hussein. We've spent $500 million to shore him up as a stabilizing factor on Israel's longest border and vis-√†-vis Syria and Iraq. Israel's attack increases the pressure on him to counterattack not only from the more radical Arab governments and from the Palestinians in Jordan but also from the Army, which is his main source of support and may now press for a chance to recoup its Sunday losses. ... They've set back progress toward a long term accommodation with the Arabs. ... They may have persuaded the Syrians that Israel didn't dare attack Soviet-protected Syria but could attack US-backed Jordan with impunity. It's important that we strengthen the hand of those within the Israeli Government who feel this is not the proper way to handle the problem. Even members of the Israeli military now doubt that retaliation will stop the cross-border raids, though they see no better solution.\\"Memorandum From the President's Special Assistant (Rostow) to President Johnson, Washington, 15 November 1966. Retrieved 8 January 2009. On 16 November 1966 the UN Security Council convened to hear the Jordanian complaint and invited an Israeli response. After hearing both sides the UK representative responded: > \\"... my delegation can find no justification whatsoever for the calculated, > admitted and wholly disproportionate act of military reprisal committed by > Israel against Jordan on 13 November.

This was presented to the Security Council a few days later. In a rare agreement, the Soviet Union joined the U.S., France and Great Britain and condemned the Israeli attack. U.S. Ambassador Arthur Goldberg termed the raid \\"inexcusable\\" and pushed for a formal U.N. resolution censuring Israel. On 25 November the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 228 unanimously deploring \\"the loss of life and heavy damage to property resulting from the action of the Government of Israel on 13 November 1966\\"; censuring \\"Israel for this large-scale military action in violation of the United Nations Charter and of the General Armistice Agreement between Israel and Jordan\\"; and emphasising \\"to Israel that actions of military reprisal cannot be tolerated and that, if they are repeated, the Security Council will have to consider further and more effective steps as envisaged in the Charter to ensure against the repetition of such acts.\\"United Nations Security Council Resolution 228, Retrieved 22 October 2005. Some months later and just weeks before the Six-Day War, the U.S. ambassador in Amman, Findley Burns, reported in a telegram to the State Department that Hussein had expressed the opinion in a conversation the day before that, > if Israel launched another Samu-scale attack against Jordan he would have no > alternative but to retaliate or face an internal revolt.

Retrieved 22 October 2005. David Ben-Gurion later criticized the raid, arguing that it weakened King Hussein's position counter to Israel's interests.Shalom, 2006, p. 80. Moshe Dayan was also critical. He believed that the Samu Operation should have been directed at the Syrians.

The two components orbit each other with a period of 1,066.0 days (2.9 years) and a low eccentricity of 0.090. The primary component of this system has a stellar classification of K1 III. A luminosity class 'III' indicates this has expanded into a giant star after exhausting the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolving away from the main sequence of stars like the Sun. The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star, after correcting for limb darkening, is , which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 27 times the radius of the Sun. It appears to be rotating slowly, with a projected rotational velocity of . This gives a lower bound on the azimuthal velocity of rotation along the star's equator.

Their family- friendly music blends gospel, country and western music. Officially re-formed on 18 August 1981, the Range Riders emerged from the western music and singing cowboy era of the early 1930s. There have been many versions of this group over the years. Range Riders have been included with the Singing Cowboy Groups http://www.b-westerns.com/singing3.htm One of their members, Roland Fraser, 91, has been involved with this group since the 1940s. The Range Riders' Anniversary concert in 2011 was Roland Fraser's last event with the group before retiring. Range Riders represent many decades of musical history, beginning in the 1930s and ranging to the present day. But, for the past 32 years, the group has been sustained by the Hanna family, which has carried on the musical tradition over three decades. Phyllis was a dominant member of the group. The Range Riders introduced a blend of western harmonies coupled with country styles to form a signature sound known as \\"cowboy music\\". The Range Riders have toured extensively over the decades, performing on local and regional TV and radio shows, fairs and large concert venues, and sharing the stage with performers such as Country Star, David Frizzell, Roy Clark, Al Petty, James Blackwood and the Blackwood Brothers, Max Crook (cowriter of the 1961 Del Shannon hit Runaway), Vern Jackson and others. According to an article By Johnny Meza, for the Desert Entertainer, Jesse, who plays piano and guitar, handles the lead singing chores along with warming up the audience before the show with some comedy and great one-liners. Missing from the group was their recently departed father Jesse, guitarist and singer, whose influence is still wonderfully evident. Mother Phyllis Hanna sings and plays rhythm guitar, sister Nokomis plays bass, brother David plays drums, another sister, Rosanell, sings and long time friend 'Uncle' Roland Fraser sings and plays the lead guitar. The Range Riders show features a wide variety of music. From Country to Rock and Roll, ballads and cowboy infused Gospel. They also feature a guest artist every month and recently, vocalist extraordinaire June Wade put on a performance that garnered several standing ovations. Phyllis Hanna, 32-year veteran performer with the country/gospel group Range Riders, died from recovery complications following surgeries for a dissected aorta Monday, Oct. 7, 2013, at the age of 79.

[Footnote] Treaty of Friendship, Feb. 26, 1921, Persia-Russ. SFSR, 9 LNTS 383. Article 11 stated: As Article 1 of the present treaty abrogates the treaty signed by the high contracting parties in February 1828, including Article 8 of that treaty, which deprived Iran of maintaining a naval force in the Caspian Sea, the high contracting parties hereby declare that henceforth both parties will have equal rights to free shipping under their own flags in the Caspian Sea. Quoted in Dabiri, supra note 10, at 5 (trans. from Persian by author). Ratifications were exchanged in Teheran on 26 February 1922. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 7 June 1922.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 9, pp. 384-413. The original purpose of the treaty was to prevent White Russian counter-revolutionary forces who fled to Iran after the Bolshevik Revolution from attacking the Soviets from Iranian territory as had happened as late as 1918. The passage of the treaty, and particularly articles 5 and 6, was subject to vigorous debate in the Persian parliament; anti- British sentiment, however, lead to its acceptance without alteration. The treaty would serve as the basis for a Soviet occupation in 1941, and articles 5 and 6 were eventually repudiated by Iran in 1979.Jacobson, pp. 66-67 Excerpts Signed at Moscow, 26 February 1921 ARTICLE 5 The two High Contracting Parties undertake: (1) To prohibit the formation or presence within their respective territories, of any organization or groups of persons, irrespective of the name by which they are known, whose object is to engage in acts of hostility against Persia or Russia, or against the Allies of Russia. They will likewise prohibit the formation of troops or armies within their respective territories with the aforementioned object. (2) Not to allow a third party or organization, whatever it be called, which is hostile to the other Contracting Party, to import or to convey in transit across their countries material which can be used against the other party. (3) To prevent by all means in their power the presence within their territories or within the territories of their Allies of all armies or forces of a third party in cases in which the presence of such forces would be regarded as a menace to the frontiers, interests or safety of the other Contracting Party. ARTICLE 6 If a third party should attempt to carry out a policy of usurpation by means of armed intervention in Persia, or if such Power should desire to use Persian territory as a base of operations against Russia, or if a Foreign Power should threaten the frontiers of Federal Russia or those of its Allies, and if the Persian Government should not be able to put a stop to such menace after having been once called upon to do so by Russia, Russia shall have the right to advance her troops into the Persian interior for the purpose of carrying out the military operations necessary for its defence. Russia undertakes, however, to withdraw her troops from Persian territory as soon as the danger has been removed. 1921 Annex (The Shah of Persia demanded Soviet clarification of Articles 5 & 6 of the Treaty of Friendship) Tehran, 12 December 1931 Your Excellency, In reply to your letter dated 20th day of Ghows, I have the honour to inform you that Articles 5 and 6 are intended to apply only to cases in which preparations have been made for a considerable armed attack upon Russia or the Soviet Republics allied to her, by the partisans of the regime which has been overthrown or by its supporters among those foreign Powers which are in a position to assist the enemies of the Workers' and Peasants' Republics and at the same time to possess themselves, by force or by underhand methods, of part of the Persian territory, thereby establishing a base of operations for any attacks‚Äîmade either directly or through the counter-revolutionary forces‚Äîwhich they might meditate against Russia or the Soviet Republics allied to her. The Articles referred to are therefore in no sense intended to apply to verbal or written attacks directed against the Soviet Government by the various Persian groups, or even by any Russian emigres in Persia, in so far as such attacks are generally tolerated as between neighbouring Powers animated by sentiments of mutual friendship. With regard to Article 13 and the small error to which you draw attention in Article 3 with reference to the Convention of 1881, I am in a position to state categorically, as I have always stated, that my Government, whose attitude towards the Persian nation is entirely friendly, has never sought to place any restrictions upon the progress and prosperity of Persia. I myself fully share this attitude, and would be prepared, should friendly relations be maintained between the two countries to promote negotiations with a view to a total or partial revision of these Articles on the lines desired by the Persian Government, as far as the interests of Russia permit. In view of the preceding statements, I trust that, as you promised me in your letter, your Government and the Mejlis will ratify the Treaty in question as soon as possible.

Born in Nimrod, Minnesota, he graduated from Sebeka High School. Stigman was listed as tall and weighed . Stigman's professional career lasted 14 seasons (1954‚Äì67). In his rookie campaign, with Cleveland, he had posted a 4‚Äì4 win‚Äìloss record with three complete games and a 3.32 earned run average through June 30.Retrosheet 1960 pitching log for Dick Stigman Surprisingly, he was selected to the American League All-Star team by manager Al L√≥pez, but he failed to appear in either of that summer's All-Star games (from 1959‚Äì62, two such games were played each year). He spent two full seasons with the Indians, and then‚Äîon the brink of the season‚Äîhe was traded to his hometown Twins with first baseman Vic Power for right-handed pitcher Pedro Ramos. That set the stage for Stigman's two most successful MLB campaigns. In 1962, he helped pitch the Twins to a shocking second-place finish in the American League. He worked in 40 games, alternating between starting and relief, and went 12‚Äì5 (3.66) with six complete games in 15 starts and three saves out of the bullpen. Then, in , Stigman took a regular turn in the Minnesota rotation, making 33 starts and working in 241 innings pitched. Although he had only a .500 record (15‚Äì15), he threw 15 complete games and three shutouts, posting an ERA of 3.25. All were career bests as the Twins finished third in the league. But was a setback for both Stigman and the Twins. He won only six of 21 decisions and his ERA rose to 4.03; the Twins, meanwhile, fell into a tie for sixth place in the AL. It cost Stigman his place in the Twins' starting rotation, as he reverted to a swing-man role. He went 4‚Äì2 (4.37) in 33 games pitched, with eight starts and four saves out of the bullpen. However, he contributed to the Twins' 1965 American League pennant, its first title since the franchise moved to Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul in 1961. Stigman did not appear in the 1965 World Series, won by the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games. The following spring, he was traded to the second-division Boston Red Sox, where he closed out his major league career. One of his two victories came on May 31, a 1‚Äì0 complete game shutout over the Chicago White Sox in which Stigman scattered seven hits.Retrosheet box score: 1966-05-31 Boston traded Stigman to the Cincinnati Reds during the off-season, and he pitched one more season of Triple-A before retiring. In his 235 big- league games pitched, including 119 starts, Stigman posted a 46‚Äì54 record. In 922 innings pitched, he surrendered 819 hits and 406 bases on balls; he fanned 755. He had 30 complete games, five shutouts and 16 career saves. In retirement, he became a businessman in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul. In his honor, a park in his home town of Nimrod was named Stigman's Mound. The Nimrod Gnats, amateur baseball team in Nimrod, named their baseball field after him.

He played center field during his first season at Duke, before converting to catcher. After hitting .380 in 1937, his junior year at Duke, he signed with the Athletics organization. Wagner then played for three different minor league teams ‚Äì in 1937 he was with the Portsmouth Cubs of the Class B Piedmont League, in 1938 the Spartanburg Spartans of the Class B South Atlantic League, and in 1939 the Newark Bears of the Class AA International League. He appeared in a total of 153 games for those teams, batting .299 (137-for-458) while hitting 4 home runs. He also made 39 appearances for the Athletics during these seasons. Major League Baseball =Philadelphia Athletics= Wagner's MLB debut came on the final day of the season ‚Äì during the second game of a doubleheader against the Washington Senators, Wagner caught the top of the 5th inning. He recorded one putout, the second out of a double play on a throw home from right field. But he did not have a plate appearance, as the game was called due to rain after the bottom of the 5th inning. Early in the season, Wagner had his first plate appearance ‚Äì again playing the Washington Senators, Wagner caught the bottom of the 8th inning, then flied out for the second out of the top of the 9th inning. He would not appear in another game with the Athletics until August, spending much of the year with Spartanburg. Wagner rejoined the Athletics in early August, and had his first MLB hit on August 20 against the New York Yankees ‚Äì as a pinch hitter in the 9th inning, he hit a single off of Monte Pearson. Wagner played in most of the Athletics' games from late August through the end of the season, ending with 33 games played and batting .227 (20-for-88) with 8 RBI. Defensively he appeared as catcher 30 times, with 22 complete games, and .972 fielding percentage. Wagner spent most of the season with Newark. In just 5 games with the Athletics ‚Äì 2 in April, 1 in May, and 2 in June ‚Äì he batted .125 (1-for-8) and defensively caught just 1 complete game. Over the next four seasons, Wagner saw his playing time with the Athletics increase ‚Äì 34 games in , 46 games in , 104 games in , and 111 games in . For those four years he batted an overall .236 (185-for-783) while catching in 263 games, 184 of them complete games. Wagner hit his first MLB home run during the final game of the 1941 season, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox on September 28, a doubleheader better remembered for Ted Williams going 6-for-8 to finish the season with a .406 batting average. For the 1942 All- Star Game, Wagner was added to the American League roster, when Bill Dickey of the Yankees was unable to play due to injury, however Wagner did not appear in the game. He hit especially well during much of 1943, batting .300 as late as mid-August, however he hit poorly over the final weeks of the season ‚Äì he had just 1 hit in his final 36 at bats ‚Äì to end the year with a .239 average. Early in the season, Wagner appeared in 5 games with the Athletics in limited duty ‚Äì four times as a pinch hitter (batting 1-for-4), and once as a late- inning defensive replacement. On May 7 he was traded to the Red Sox in exchange for outfielder Ford Garrison, as the Red Sox were concerned that their number one catcher Roy Partee might get drafted into wartime military service. In total, Wagner played parts of 8 seasons with the Athletics, appearing in 339 games while batting .234 with 3 home runs and 89 RBI. =Boston Red Sox= Arriving in trade from the Athletics, Wagner played his first game with Boston on May 10, 1944, and received steady playing time in a platoon with the right-handed hitting Roy Partee. During June, for example, Wagner caught 11 complete games and appeared in 3 others, while Partee caught 14 complete games and appeared in 1 other. Wagner hit especially well during July and August, raising his average from .274 on June 30, to .295 on July 30, to .330 on August 27. But with World War II still ongoing, Wagner was called to serve, and on August 28 he joined the US Army. He missed the remainder of the 1944 season, and all of the season, due to his military service. After the conclusion of the war, Wagner was released from the Army in October 1945. Wagner was the Red Sox' number one catcher during , catching 102 complete games of Boston's 154 game schedule, while the team broke a 28-year pennant drought by capturing the American League championship by 12 games over the Detroit Tigers. Although he batted only .230 for the season, he had career highs of 6 home runs and 52 RBI, and was selected to the 1946 All-Star Game, flying out in his one at bat as a substitute catcher during the game. Wagner appeared in five games of the 1946 World Series, but went hitless in 13 at bats against the St. Louis Cardinals, who defeated Boston in seven games. Early in the season, the Red Sox traded Wagner to the Tigers for fellow catcher Birdie Tebbetts, a native New Englander who went on to have 3¬Ω stellar seasons for Boston. At the time of the trade, May 20, neither catcher was hitting very well ‚Äì .231 for Wagner, and .094 for Tebbetts. Their managers felt a change in home ballpark might benefit both players, which turned out to be accurate, as Wagner hit .288 for Detroit over the remainder of the season, while Tebbetts hit .299 for Boston. Overall, Wagner played in 204 games during parts of three seasons with Boston, batting .264 with 7 home runs and 96 RBI. =Detroit Tigers= Through the end of the 1947 season, Wagner appeared in 71 games with Detroit, batting .288 with 5 home runs and 33 RBI, backing up Bob Swift at catcher. During , Wagner again was in a backup role, and he struggled at the plate, batting .202 with 10 RBI in 54 games through his final appearance with Detroit on September 9 ‚Äì he was waived by the team shortly thereafter. Over parts of two seasons with the Tigers, Wagner appeared in 125 games while batting .257 with 5 home runs and 43 RBI. =Philadelphia Phillies= Wagner was selected from waivers by the Phillies, and late in the 1948 season he appeared in three games with them ‚Äì once as a pinch hitter, once at catcher, and once as a pinch runner ‚Äì and he was hitless in 4 at bats. Early in the seasons, Wagner made just one appearance with the Phillies, as starting catcher in the second game of an April 19 doubleheader against the Boston Braves; he was hitless during the game. It would be his final MLB appearance, as he was released by the Phillies one month later. Wagner's short stay in the National League was a total of four games played, and no hits. After the majors Wagner spent most of 1949 with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class AAA International League, appearing in 95 games and batting for a .260 average, and then spent 1950 with the Dallas Eagles of the Class AA Texas League, batting .212 in 89 games. After his career, he continue to live in his hometown ‚Äì he died in 1979 at the age of 64, in nearby Riverside, New Jersey.
