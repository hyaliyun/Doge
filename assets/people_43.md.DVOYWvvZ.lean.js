Though it possesses no territory, the order is a sovereign entity of international law, enjoys permanent observer status at the United Nations, and maintains diplomatic relations with many countries. SMOM claims continuity with the Knights Hospitaller, a chivalric order that was founded by the Blessed Gerard in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.Sainty, Guy Stair, ed. World Orders of Knighthood and Merit, Burke's, August 2006. The order is led by an elected Prince and Grand Master. Its motto is Tuitio fidei et obsequium pauperum ('defence of the faith and assistance to the poor'). The order venerates the Virgin Mary as its patroness, under the title of Our Lady of Philermos.  Name and insignia  Coat of arms of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta The order has a large number of local priories and associations around the world, but there also exist a number of organizations with similar- sounding names that are unrelated, including numerous fraudulent (self-styled) orders seeking to capitalize on the name. In the ecclesiastical heraldry of the Catholic Church, the Order of Malta is one of only two orders (along with the Order of the Holy Sepulchre) whose insignia may be displayed in a clerical coat of arms. (Laypersons have no such restriction.) The shield is surrounded with a silver rosary for professed knights, or for others the ribbon of their rank. Some members may also display the Maltese cross behind their shield instead of the ribbon.Noonan 1996 In order to protect its heritage against fraud, the order has legally registered 16 versions of its names and emblems in some 100 countries.  Early history  = Founding = Gerard Thom, founder of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. Copper engraving by Laurent Cars, c. 1725. The birth of the order dates back to around 1048. Merchants from the ancient Marine Republic of Amalfi obtained from the Caliph of Egypt the authorisation to build a church, convent, and hospital in Jerusalem, to care for pilgrims of any religious faith or race. The Order of St. John of Jerusalem ‚Äì the monastic community that ran the hospital for the pilgrims in the Holy Land ‚Äì became independent under the guidance of its founder, the religious brother Gerard. With the Papal bull Pie postulatio voluntatis dated 15 February 1113, Pope Paschal II approved the foundation of the Hospital and placed it under the aegis of the Holy See, granting it the right to freely elect its superiors without interference from other secular or religious authorities. By virtue of the Papal Bull, the hospital became an order exempt from the control of the local church. All the Knights were religious, bound by the three monastic vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. The constitution of the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem during the Crusades obliged the order to take on the military defence of the sick, the pilgrims, and the captured territories. The order thus added the task of defending the faith to that of its hospitaller mission. As time went on, the order adopted the white, eight- pointed Cross that is still its symbol today. The eight points represent the eight beatitudes that Jesus pronounced in his Sermon on the Mount. = Cyprus = When the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land fell after the Siege of Acre in 1291, the order settled first in Cyprus. =Rhodes= In 1310, led by Grand Master Fra' Foulques de Villaret, the knights regrouped on the island of Rhodes. From there, the defense of the Christian world required the organization of a naval force; so the Order built a powerful fleet and sailed the eastern Mediterranean, fighting battles for the sake of Christendom, including Crusades in Syria and Egypt. In the early 14th century, the institutions of the Order and the knights who came to Rhodes from every corner of Europe were grouped according to the languages they spoke. The first seven such groups, or Langues (Tongues) ‚Äì from Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy, Aragon (Navarre), England (with Scotland and Ireland), and Germany ‚Äì became eight in 1492, when Castile and Portugal were separated from the Langue of Aragon. Each Langue included Priories or Grand Priories, Bailiwicks, and Commanderies. The Order was governed by its Grand Master, the Prince of Rhodes, and its Council. From its beginning, independence from other nations granted by pontifical charter and the universally recognised right to maintain and deploy armed forces constituted grounds for the international sovereignty of the Order, which minted its own coins and maintained diplomatic relations with other states. The senior positions of the Order were given to representatives of different Langues. In 1523, after six months of siege and fierce combat against the fleet and army of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, the Knights were forced to surrender, and left Rhodes with military honours.  Later history  = Summary = The headquarters of the Order of Saint John was located in Malta from 1530 until 1798. It was technically a vassal of the Kingdom of Sicily, holding Malta in exchange for a nominal fee, but declared independence in 1753. It was expelled from Malta under the French occupation in 1798 and, from 1805 to 1812, many of its possessions in Protestant Europe were confiscated, resulting in the fragmentation of the order into a number of Protestant branches, since 1961 united under the umbrella of the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem. The Congress of Vienna of 1815 confirmed the loss of Malta. The seat of the order was moved to Ferrara in 1826 and to Rome in 1834, the interior of Palazzo Malta being considered extraterritorial sovereign territory of the order. The grand priories of Lombardy-Venetia and of Sicily were restored from 1839 to 1841. The office of Grand Master was restored by Pope Leo XIII in 1879, after a vacancy of 75 years, confirming Giovanni Battista Ceschi a Santa Croce as the first Grand Master of the restored Order of Malta. The Holy See was established as a subject of international law in the Lateran Treaty of 1929. In the following decades, the connection between the Holy See and the Order of Malta was seen as so close as to call into question the actual sovereignty of the order as a separate entity. This has prompted constitutional changes on the part of the Order, which were implemented in 1997. Since then, the Order has been widely recognized as a sovereign subject of international law in its own right.\\"On account of some arguments presented in the 1950s, to the effect that the ties with the Holy See in a constitutional and international law context were so close and frequent that the true sovereignty of the Order could be called in question, constitutional changes were made by the Order. These were established in 1997. While the previous constitution laid down that the Order of Malta was a 'legal entity solemnly recognised by the Holy See', this formulation has now been removed from the Order's constitution. The previous constitution prescribed that, after being elected, the head of state of the Order of Malta, that is to say the Grand Master, must be approved by the Pope, the new wording in the constitution only prescribes that after election the Grand Master shall inform the Pope of his election. The requirement of approval has gone and is replaced by a simple communication on the part of the Grand Master. Changes have been implemented throughout to show that the Order is independent of the Holy See from the constitutional and international law perspective.\\" Bo J. Theutenberg, The Holy See, the Order of Malta and International Law (2003), It maintains diplomatic relations with 110 states, has permanent observer status at the United Nations, enters into treaties and issues its own passports, coins and postage stamps. Its two headquarters buildings in Rome enjoy extraterritoriality, similar to embassies, and it maintains embassies in other countries. The ANZA news agency has called it \\"the smallest sovereign state in the world\\". The three principal officers are counted as citizens. The Order has 13,500 Knights, Dames and auxiliary members. A few dozen of these are professed religious. Until the 1990s, the highest classes of membership, including officers, required proof of noble lineage. More recently, a path was created for Knights and Dames of the lowest class (of whom proof of aristocratic lineage is not required) to be specially elevated to the highest class, making them eligible for office in the order. The order employs about 42,000 doctors, nurses, auxiliaries and paramedics assisted by 80,000 volunteers in more than 120 countries, assisting children, homeless, handicapped, elderly, and terminally ill people, refugees, and lepers around the world without distinction of ethnicity or religion. Through its worldwide relief corps, Malteser International, the order aids victims of natural disasters, epidemics and war. In several countries, including France, Germany and Ireland, local associations of the order are important providers of medical emergency services and training. Its annual budget is on the order of 1.5 billion euros, largely funded by European governments, the United Nations and the European Union, foundations and public donors. = Malta = Bust portrait of a Knight of Malta The order remained without a territory of its own until 1530, when Grand Master Fra' Philippe de Villiers de l'Isle Adam took possession of the island of Malta, granted to the order by Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and his mother Queen Joanna of Castile as monarchs of Sicily, with the approval of Pope Clement VII, for which the order had to honour the conditions of the Tribute of the Maltese Falcon.  Protestant Reformation  The Reformation which split Western Europe into Protestant and Catholic states affected the knights as well. In several countries, including England, Scotland and Sweden, the order was dissolved. In others, including the Netherlands and Germany, entire bailiwicks or commanderies (administrative divisions of the order) experienced religious conversions; these \\"Johanniter orders\\" survive in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden and many other countries, including the United States and South Africa. It was established that the order should remain neutral in any war between Christian nations. Colonies in the Caribbean  Map of the colonies of the order in the Caribbean during the 17th century From 1651 to 1665, the Order of Saint John ruled four islands in the Caribbean. On 21 May 1651 it acquired the islands of Saint Barth√©lemy, Saint Christopher, Saint Croix and Saint Martin. These were purchased from the French Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique which had just been dissolved. In 1665, the four islands were sold to the French West India Company. Great siege of Malta In 1565, the Knights, led by Grand Master Fra' Jean de Vallette (after whom the capital of Malta, Valletta, was named), defended the island for more than three months during the Great Siege by the Turks.  Battle of Lepanto  The Battle of Lepanto (1571), unknown artist, late 16th century The fleet of the order contributed to the ultimate destruction of the Ottoman naval power in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, led by John of Austria, half brother of King Philip II of Spain.  French occupation of Malta  Emperor Paul wearing the Crown of the Grand Master of the Order of Malta (1799). Their Mediterranean stronghold of Malta was captured by the French First Republic under Napoleon in 1798 during his expedition to Egypt, following the French Revolution and the subsequent French Revolutionary Wars. Napoleon demanded from Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim that his ships be allowed to enter the port and to take on water and supplies. The Grand Master replied that only two foreign ships could be allowed to enter the port at a time. Bonaparte, aware that such a procedure would take a very long time and would leave his forces vulnerable to Admiral Nelson, immediately ordered a cannon fusillade against Malta.Cole, Juan (2007). Napoleon's Egypt: Invading the Middle East. Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 8‚Äì9. The French soldiers disembarked in Malta at seven points on the morning of 11 June and attacked. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Maltese in the west were forced to surrender.Cole, Juan (2007). Napoleon's Egypt: Invading the Middle East. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 9. Napoleon opened negotiations with the fortress capital of Valletta. Faced with vastly superior French forces and the loss of western Malta, the Grand Master negotiated a surrender to the invasion.Cole, Juan (2007). Napoleon's Egypt: Invading the Middle East. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 10. Hompesch left Malta for Trieste on 18 June.Whitworth Porter, A History of the Knights of Malta (London: Longman, Brown, Green, 1858). p. 457. He resigned as Grand Master on 6 July 1799. The knights were dispersed, though the order continued to exist in a diminished form and negotiated with European governments for a return to power. The Russian Emperor, Paul I, gave the largest number of knights shelter in Saint Petersburg, an action which gave rise to the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller and the Order's recognition among the Russian Imperial Orders. The refugee knights in Saint Petersburg proceeded to elect Tsar Paul as their Grand Master ‚Äì a rival to Grand Master von Hompesch until the latter's abdication left Paul as the sole Grand Master. Grand Master Paul I created, in addition to the Roman Catholic Grand Priory, a \\"Russian Grand Priory\\" of no fewer than 118 Commanderies, dwarfing the rest of the Order and open to all Christians. Paul's election as Grand Master was, however, never ratified under Roman Catholic canon law, and he was the de facto rather than de jure Grand Master of the Order. By the early 19th century, the order had been severely weakened by the loss of its priories throughout Europe. Only 10% of the order's income came from traditional sources in Europe, with the remaining 90% being generated by the Russian Grand Priory until 1810. This was partly reflected in the government of the Order being under Lieutenants, rather than Grand Masters, in the period 1805 to 1879, when Pope Leo XIII restored a Grand Master to the order. This signaled the renewal of the order's fortunes as a humanitarian and religious organization. On 19 September 1806, the Swedish government offered the sovereignty of the island of Gotland to the Order. The offer was rejected since it would have meant the Order renouncing their claim to Malta. =Exile= The French forces occupying Malta expelled the knights from their country. During the seventeen years that separated the seizure of Malta and the General Peace, \\"the formality of electing a brother Chief to discharge the office of Grand Master, and thus to preserve the vitlaiy of the Sovereign Institute, was duty attended to\\". The office of Lieutenant of the Magistery and ad interim of Grand Master was held by the Grand Baillies Field Marshal Counto Soltikoff, Giovanni Tommasi, De Gaevera, Giovanni y Centelles, De Candida and the Count Colloredo. Their mandates complexively covered the period until the death of the Emperor Paul in 1801. The paper cited the Synoptical Sketch as the best source available for the subject matter. The text was identically repeated in The Freemasons' Monthly Magazine, 18 April 1863, p. 3. The Treaty of Amiens (1802) obliged the United Kingdom to evacuate Malta which was to be restored to a recreated Order of St. John, whose sovereignty was to be guaranteed by all of the major European powers, to be determined at the final peace. However, this was not to be because objections to the treaty quickly grew in the UK. Bonaparte's rejection of a British offer involving a ten-year lease of Malta prompted the reactivation of the British blockade of the French coast; Britain declared war on France on 18 May.Pocock, Tom (2005). The Terror Before Trafalgar: Nelson, Napoleon, And The Secret War. Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press. . OCLC 56419314.p. 78 The 1802 treaty was never implemented. The UK gave its official reasons for resuming hostilities as France's imperialist policies in the West Indies, Italy, and Switzerland.Illustrated History of Europe: A Unique Guide to Europe's Common Heritage (1992) p. 282 =Rome= Palazzo Malta, Rome, Italy After having temporarily resided in Messina, Catania, and Ferrara, in 1834 the precursor of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta settled definitively in Rome, where it owns, with extraterritorial status, the Magistral Palace in Via Condotti 68 and the Magistral Villa on the Aventine Hill. The original hospitaller mission became the main activity of the order, growing ever stronger during the 20th century, most especially because of the contribution of the activities carried out by the Grand Priories and National Associations in many countries around the world. Large-scale hospitaller and charitable activities were carried out during World Wars I and II under Grand Master Fra' Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere (1931‚Äì1951). Under the Grand Masters Fra' Angelo de Mojana di Cologna (1962‚Äì88) and Fra' Andrew Bertie (1988‚Äì2008), the projects expanded. Relations with the Republic of Malta Flags of Malta and the SMOM on Fort St Angelo Two bilateral treaties were concluded with the Republic of Malta. The first treaty is dated 21 June 1991 and is now no longer in force. The second treaty was signed on 5 December 1998 and ratified on 1 November 2001. This agreement grants the Order the use with limited extraterritoriality of the upper portion of Fort St. Angelo in the city of Birgu. Its stated purpose is \\"to give the Order the opportunity to be better enabled to carry out its humanitarian activities as Knights Hospitallers from Saint Angelo, as well as to better define the legal status of Saint Angelo subject to the sovereignty of Malta over it\\". The agreement has a duration of 99 years, but the document allows the Maltese Government to terminate it at any time after 50 years. Under the terms of the agreement, the flag of Malta is to be flown together with the flag of the Order in a prominent position over Saint Angelo. No asylum may be granted by the Order and generally the Maltese courts have full jurisdiction and Maltese law shall apply. The second bilateral treaty mentions a number of immunities and privileges, none of which appeared in the earlier treaty. 2010s In February 2013, the order celebrated the 900th anniversary of its papal recognition with a general audience with Pope Benedict XVI and a Mass celebrated by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone in Saint Peter's Basilica. = Crisis and constitutional reform = The Order experienced a leadership crisis beginning in December 2016, when Albrecht von Boeselager protested his removal as Grand Chancellor by Grand Master Matthew Festing. In January 2017 Pope Francis ordered von Boeselager reinstated and required Festing's resignation. Francis also named Archbishop Giovanni Becciu Becciu was Substitute for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State, a position akin to that of a papal chief of staff. as his personal representative to the Order ‚Äì sidelining the Order's Cardinal Patron Raymond Burke ‚Äì until the election of a new Grand Master. The Pope effectively taking control over the order was seen by some as a break with tradition and the independence of the order. In May 2017, the Order named Mauro Bertero Guti√©rrez, a Bolivian member of the Government Council, to lead its constitutional reform process. And in May 2018 when a new Grand Master was elected, Francis extended Becciu's mandate indefinitely. In June 2017, in a departure from tradition, the leadership of the Order wore informal attire rather than formal wear full dress uniforms to their annual papal audience. When the Order's General Chapter met in May 2019, as it does every five years, the participants included women for the first time, three of the 62 participants. Organisation Fra' Giacomo dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto, 80th Prince and Grand Master =Governance= The proceedings of the Order are governed by its Constitutional Charter and the Order's Code. It is divided internationally into six territorial Grand Priories, six Sub- Priories and 47 national associations. The six Grand Priories are: * Grand Priory of Rome * Grand Priory of Lombardy and Venice * Grand Priory of Naples and Sicily * Grand Priory of Bohemia * Grand Priory of Austria * Grand Priory of England The supreme head of the Order is the Prince and Grand Master, who is elected for life by the Council Complete of State, holds the precedence of a cardinal of the Church since 1630 and received the rank of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1607.Sire, H.J.A. (1994). The Knights of Malta. Yale University Press p.221.Noonan, Jr., James-Charles (1996). The Church Visible: The Ceremonial Life and Protocol of the Roman Catholic Church. Viking. p. 135. Fra' Giacomo dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto was elected 80th Grand Master on 2 May 2018, a year after Fra' Matthew Festing resigned as Grand Master at the insistence of Pope Francis. Electors in the Council Complete of State include the members of the Sovereign Council, other office-holders and representatives of the members of the Order. The Grand Master is aided by the Sovereign Council (the government of the Order), which is elected by the Chapter General, the legislative body of the Order. The Chapter General meets every five years; at each meeting, all seats of the Sovereign Council are up for election. The Sovereign Council includes six members and four High Officers: the Grand Commander, the Grand Chancellor, the Grand Hospitaller and the Receiver of the Common Treasure. The Grand Commander is the chief religious officer of the Order and serves as Lieutenant \\"ad interim\\" during a vacancy in the office of Grand Master. The Grand Chancellor, whose office includes those of the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is the head of the executive branch; he is responsible for the Diplomatic Missions of the Order and relations with the national Associations. The Grand Hospitaller's responsibilities include the offices of Minister for Humanitarian Action and Minister for International Cooperation; he coordinates the Order's humanitarian and charitable activities. Finally, the Receiver of the Common Treasure is the Minister of Finance and Budget; he directs the administration of the finances and property of the Order.  Patrons of the order since 1961  Cardinal Raymond Burke, Patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta since 2014 The patron, who is either a cardinal when appointed by the pope or soon raised to that rank, promotes the spiritual interests of the Order and its members, and its relations with the Holy See. # Paolo Giobbe (8 August 1961 ‚Äì 3 July 1969) # Giacomo Violardo (3 July 1969 ‚Äì 17 March 1978) # Paul-Pierre Philippe, O.P. (10 November 1978 ‚Äì 9 April 1984) # Sebastiano Baggio (26 May 1984 ‚Äì 21 March 1993) # Pio Laghi (8 May 1993 ‚Äì 11 January 2009) # Paolo Sardi (6 June 2009 ‚Äì 8 November 2014) # Raymond Burke (8 November 2014 ‚Äì present; sidelined since 2017) Prelate of the order The pope appoints the prelate of the order to supervise the clergy of the order, choosing from among three candidates proposed by the Grand Master. On 4 July 2015 Pope Francis named as prelate Bishop Jean Laffitte, who had held various offices in the Roman Curia for more than a decade. Laffitte succeeded Archbishop Angelo Acerbi, who had held the office since 2001. Laffitte's appointment followed the traditional meeting between the pope and the Grand Master, and an audience with the Grand Chancellor and others as well, held on 24 June, the feast of St. John the Baptist. = Membership = A Knight of Grace and Devotion in contemporary church robes Membership in the order is divided into three classes each of which is subdivided into several categories: *First Class, containing only one category: Knights of Justice or Professed Knights, and the Professed Conventual Chaplains, who take religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and form what amounts to a religious order. Until the 1990s membership in this class was restricted to members of families with noble lineages. There are also three surviving enclosed monasteries of nuns of the Order, two in Spain that date from the 11/12th centuries and one in Malta, whose members hold the same rank in the Order as chaplains. *Second Class: Knight and Dames in Obedience, similarly restricted until recently, these knights and dames make a promise, rather than a vow, of obedience. This class is subdivided into three categories, namely that of Knight and Dames of Honour and Devotion in Obedience, Knight and Dames of Grace and Devotion in Obedience, and Knight and Dames of Magistral Grace in Obedience. *Third Class, which is subdivided into six categories: Knights and Dames of Honour and Devotion, Conventual Chaplains ad honorem, Knights and Dames of Grace and Devotion, Magistral Chaplains, Knights and Dames of Magistral Grace, and Donats (male and female) of Devotion. All categories of this class are made up of members who take no vows and who grew to show a decreasingly extensive history of nobility. Knights and Dames of magistral grace need not prove any noble lineage and are the most common class of knights in the United States. Within each class and category of knights are ranks ranging from bailiff grand cross (the highest) through knight grand cross, and knight ‚Äì thus one could be a \\"knight of grace and devotion,\\" or a \\"bailiff grand cross of justice.\\" The final rank of donat is offered to some who join the order in the class of \\"justice\\" but who are not knights. Bishops and priests are generally honorary members, or knights, of the Order of Malta. However, there are some priests who are full members of the Order, and this is usually because they were conferred knighthood prior to ordination. The priests of the Order of Malta are ranked as Honorary Canons, as in the Order of the Holy Sepulchre; and they are entitled to wear the black mozetta with purple piping and purple fascia. Prior to the 1990s, all officers of the Order had to be of noble birth (i.e., armigerous for at least a hundred years), as they were all knights of justice or of obedience. However, Knights of Magistral Grace (i.e., those without noble proofs) now may make the Promise of Obedience and, at the discretion of the Grand Master and Sovereign Council, may enter the novitiate to become professed Knights of Justice. Worldwide, there are over 13,000 knights and dames, of whom approximately 55 are professed religious. Membership in the Order is by invitation only and solicitations are not entertained. The Order's finances are audited by a Board of Auditors, which includes a President and four Councillors, all elected by the Chapter General. The Order's judicial powers are exercised by a group of Magistral Courts, whose judges are appointed by the Grand Master and Sovereign Council. = Relationship with other mutually-recognised Orders of Saint John = The Sovereign Military Order of Malta has collaborated with other mutually-recognized Orders of Saint John; for example, the SMOM is a major donor of the St John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem, which is primarily operated by the Venerable Order of Saint John.  International status  thumb500pxForeign relations with the SMOM: Coat of arms of the Knights of Malta from the fa√ßade of the church of San Giovannino dei Cavalieri, Florence, Italy Vehicle registration plate of the Order, as seen in Rome, Italy Saint Peter's Castle, Bodrum, Turkey. Left to right: SMOM has formal diplomatic relations with 110 states and has official relations with another five states and with the European Union. Additionally it has relations with the International Committee of the Red Cross and a number of international organizations, including observer status at the UN and some of the specialized agencies. Its international nature is useful in enabling it to pursue its humanitarian activities without being seen as an operative of any particular nation. Its sovereignty is also expressed in the issuance of passports, licence plates, stamps, and coins. With its unique history and unusual present circumstances, the exact status of the Order in international law has been the subject of debate. It describes itself as a \\"sovereign subject of international law.\\" Its two headquarters in Rome ‚Äì the Palazzo Malta in Via dei Condotti 68, where the Grand Master resides and Government Bodies meet, and the Villa del Priorato di Malta on the Aventine, which hosts the Grand Priory of Rome ‚Äì Fort St. Angelo on the island of Malta, the Embassy of the Order to Holy See, and the Embassy of the Order to Italy have all been granted extraterritoriality by Italy and Malta. Unlike the Holy See, however, which is sovereign over Vatican City and thus has clear territorial separation of its sovereign area and that of Italy, SMOM has had no territory since the loss of the island of Malta in 1798, other than only those current properties with extraterritoriality listed above. Italy recognizes, in addition to extraterritoriality, the exercise by SMOM of all the prerogatives of sovereignty in its headquarters. Therefore, Italian sovereignty and SMOM sovereignty uniquely coexist without overlapping. The United Nations does not classify it as a \\"non-member state\\" or \\"intergovernmental organization\\" but as one of the \\"other entities having received a standing invitation to participate as observers.\\" For instance, while the International Telecommunication Union has granted radio identification prefixes to such quasi-sovereign jurisdictions as the United Nations and the Palestinian Authority, SMOM has never received one. For awards purposes, amateur radio operators consider SMOM to be a separate \\"entity\\", but stations transmitting from there use an entirely unofficial callsign, starting with the prefix \\"1A\\". Likewise, for internet and telecommunications identification, the SMOM has neither sought nor been granted a top-level domain or international dialling code, whereas the Vatican City uses its own domain (.va), and has been allocated the country code +379. There are differing opinions as to whether a claim to sovereign status has been recognized. Ian Brownlie, Helmut Steinberger, and Wilhelm Wengler are among experts who say that the claim has not been recognized. Even taking into account the Order's ambassadorial diplomatic status among many nations, a claim to sovereign status is sometimes rejected. The Order maintains diplomatic missions around the world and many of the states reciprocate by accrediting ambassadors to the Order (usually their ambassador to the Holy See). Wengler ‚Äì a German professor of international law ‚Äì addresses this point in his book V√∂lkerrecht (1964), and rejects the notion that recognition of the Order by some states can make it a subject of international law. Conversely, professor Rebecca Wallace ‚Äì writing more recently in her book International Law (1986) ‚Äì explains that a sovereign entity does not have to be a country, and that SMOM is an example of this. This position appears to be supported by the number of nations extending diplomatic relations to the Order, which more than doubled from 49 to 100 in the 20-year period to 2008. In 1953, the Holy See decreed that the Order of Malta's quality as a sovereign institution is functional, to ensure the achievement of its purposes in the world, and that as a subject of international law, it enjoys certain powers, but not the entire set of powers of sovereignty \\"in the full sense of the word.\\" On 24 June 1961, Pope John XXIII approved the Constitutional Charter, which contains the most solemn reaffirmations of the sovereignty of the Order. Article 1 affirms that \\"the Order is a legal entity formally approved by the Holy See. It has the quality of a subject of international law.\\" Article 3 states that \\"the intimate connection existing between the two qualities of a religious order and a sovereign order do not oppose the autonomy of the order in the exercise of its sovereignty and prerogatives inherent to it as a subject of international law in relation to States.\\" =Currency and postage stamps= The SMOM coins are appreciated more for their subject matter than for their use as currency; SMOM postage stamps, however, have been gaining acceptance among Universal Postal Union member nations. The SMOM began issuing euro- denominated postage stamps in 2005, although the scudo remains the official currency of the SMOM. Also in 2005, the Italian post agreed with the SMOM to deliver internationally most classes of mail other than registered, insured, and special-delivery mail; additionally 56 countries recognize SMOM stamps for franking purposes, including those such as Canada and Mongolia that lack diplomatic relations with the Order. Military Corps Logotype of the Military Corps of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta Military Corps of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, ACISMOM, in parade during Festa della Repubblica in Rome (2007) The Order states that it was the hospitaller role that enabled the Order to survive the end of the crusading era; nonetheless, it retains its military title and traditions. On 26 March 1876, the Association of the Italian Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (Associazione dei cavalieri italiani del sovrano militare ordine di Malta, ACISMOM) reformed the Order's military to a modern military unit of the era. This unit provided medical support to the Italian Army and on 9 April 1909 the military corps officially became a special auxiliary volunteer corps of the Italian Army under the name Corpo Militare dell'Esercito dell'ACISMOM (Army Military Corps of the ACISMOM), wearing Italian uniforms. Since then the Military Corps have operated with the Italian Army both in wartime and peacetime in medical or paramedical military functions, and in ceremonial functions for the Order, such as standing guard around the coffins of high officers of the Order before and during funeral rites. =Air force= Roundel of the air force of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta SMOM Savoia- Marchetti SM.82 at the Italian Air Force Museum In 1947, after the post-World War II peace treaty forbade Italy to own or operate bomber aircraft and only operate a limited number of transport aircraft, the Italian Air Force opted to transfer some of its Savoia-Marchetti SM.82 aircraft to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, pending the definition of their exact status (the SM.82 were properly long range transport aircraft that could be adapted for bombing missions). These aircraft were operated by Italian Air Force personnel temporarily flying for the Order, carried the Order's roundels on the fuselage and Italian ones on the wings, and were used mainly for standard Italian Air Force training and transport missions but also for some humanitarian tasks proper of the Order of Malta (like the transport of sick pilgrims to the Lourdes sanctuary). In the early '50s, when the strictures of the peace treaty had been much relaxed by the Allied authorities, the aircraft returned under full control of the Italian Air Force. One of the aircraft transferred to the Order of Malta, still with the Order's fuselage roundels, is preserved in the Italian Air Force Museum.Military Aircraft Insignia of the World by John Cochrane and Stuart Elliott, published 1998 by Airlife Publishing Limited of Shrewsbury, England (illustrated). =Logistics= The Military Corps has become known in mainland Europe for its operation of hospital trains, a service which was carried out intensively during both World Wars. The Military Corps still operates a modern 28-car hospital train with 192 hospital beds, serviced by a medical staff of 38 medics and paramedics provided by the Order and a technical staff provided by the Italian Army's Railway Engineer Regiment.

Periodic functions are used throughout science to describe oscillations, waves, and other phenomena that exhibit periodicity. Any function that is not periodic is called aperiodic. An illustration of a periodic function with period P. Definition A function is said to be periodic if, for some nonzero constant , it is the case that :f(x+P) = f(x) for all values of in the domain. A nonzero constant for which this is the case is called a period of the function. If there exists a least positiveFor some functions, like a constant function or the Dirichlet function (the indicator function of the rational numbers), a least positive period may not exist (the infimum of all positive periods being zero). constant with this property, it is called the fundamental period (also primitive period, basic period, or prime period.) Often, \\"the\\" period of a function is used to mean its fundamental period. A function with period will repeat on intervals of length , and these intervals are sometimes also referred to as periods of the function. Geometrically, a periodic function can be defined as a function whose graph exhibits translational symmetry, i.e. a function is periodic with period if the graph of is invariant under translation in the -direction by a distance of . This definition of periodicity can be extended to other geometric shapes and patterns, as well as be generalized to higher dimensions, such as periodic tessellations of the plane. A sequence can also be viewed as a function defined on the natural numbers, and for a periodic sequence these notions are defined accordingly. Examples A graph of the sine function, showing two complete periods =Real number examples= The sine function is periodic with period 2\\\\pi, since :\\\\sin(x + 2\\\\pi) = \\\\sin x for all values of x. This function repeats on intervals of length 2\\\\pi (see the graph to the right). Everyday examples are seen when the variable is time; for instance the hands of a clock or the phases of the moon show periodic behaviour. Periodic motion is motion in which the position(s) of the system are expressible as periodic functions, all with the same period. For a function on the real numbers or on the integers, that means that the entire graph can be formed from copies of one particular portion, repeated at regular intervals. A simple example of a periodic function is the function f that gives the \\"fractional part\\" of its argument. Its period is 1. In particular, : f(0.5) = f(1.5) = f(2.5) = \\\\cdots = 0.5 The graph of the function f is the sawtooth wave. A plot of f(x) = \\\\sin(x) and g(x) = \\\\cos(x); both functions are periodic with period 2œÄ. The trigonometric functions sine and cosine are common periodic functions, with period 2œÄ (see the figure on the right). The subject of Fourier series investigates the idea that an 'arbitrary' periodic function is a sum of trigonometric functions with matching periods. According to the definition above, some exotic functions, for example the Dirichlet function, are also periodic; in the case of Dirichlet function, any nonzero rational number is a period. =Complex number examples= Using complex variables we have the common period function: :e^{ikx} = \\\\cos kx + i\\\\,\\\\sin kx. Since the cosine and sine functions are both periodic with period 2œÄ, the complex exponential is made up of cosine and sine waves. This means that Euler's formula (above) has the property such that if L is the period of the function, then :L = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{k}. Complex functions may be periodic along one line or axis in the complex plane but not on another. For instance, e^{z} is periodic along the imaginary axis but not the real axis. Double-periodic functions A function whose domain is the complex numbers can have two incommensurate periods without being constant. The elliptic functions are such functions. (\\"Incommensurate\\" in this context means not real multiples of each other.) Properties Periodic functions can take on values many times. More specifically, if a function f is periodic with period P, then for all x in the domain of f and all positive integers n, : f(x + nP) = f(x) If f(x) is a function with period P, then f(ax), where a is a non-zero real number such that ax is within the domain of f, is periodic with period \\\\frac{P}{a}. For example, f(x) = \\\\sin(x) has period 2 \\\\pi therefore \\\\sin(5x) will have period \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{5}. Some periodic functions can be described by Fourier series. For instance, for L2 functions, Carleson's theorem states that they have a pointwise (Lebesgue) almost everywhere convergent Fourier series. Fourier series can only be used for periodic functions, or for functions on a bounded (compact) interval. If f is a periodic function with period P that can be described by a Fourier series, the coefficients of the series can be described by an integral over an interval of length P. Generalizations =Antiperiodic functions= One common subset of periodic functions is that of antiperiodic functions. This is a function f such that f(x + P) = ‚àíf(x) for all x. (Thus, a P-antiperiodic function is a 2P-periodic function.) For example, the sine and cosine functions are œÄ-antiperiodic and 2œÄ-periodic. While a P-antiperiodic function is a 2P-periodic function, the inverse is not necessarily true. =Bloch-periodic functions= A further generalization appears in the context of Bloch's theorems and Floquet theory, which govern the solution of various periodic differential equations. In this context, the solution (in one dimension) is typically a function of the form: :f(x+P) = e^{ikP} f(x) where k is a real or complex number (the Bloch wavevector or Floquet exponent). Functions of this form are sometimes called Bloch-periodic in this context. A periodic function is the special case k = 0, and an antiperiodic function is the special case k = œÄ/P. =Quotient spaces as domain= In signal processing you encounter the problem, that Fourier series represent periodic functions and that Fourier series satisfy convolution theorems (i.e. convolution of Fourier series corresponds to multiplication of represented periodic function and vice versa), but periodic functions cannot be convolved with the usual definition, since the involved integrals diverge. A possible way out is to define a periodic function on a bounded but periodic domain. To this end you can use the notion of a quotient space: :{\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z}} = \\\\\\\\{x+\\\\mathbb{Z} : x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{y : y\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\land y-x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\\\\\} : x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\\}. That is, each element in {\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z}} is an equivalence class of real numbers that share the same fractional part. Thus a function like f : {\\\\mathbb{R}/\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} is a representation of a 1-periodic function. Calculating period Consider a real waveform consisting of superimposed frequencies, expressed in a set as ratios to a fundamental frequency, f: F = [f f f ‚Ä¶ f] where all non-zero elements ‚â•1 and at least one of the elements of the set is 1. To find the period, T, first find the least common denominator of all the elements in the set. Period can be found as T = . Consider that for a simple sinusoid, T = . Therefore, the LCD can be seen as a periodicity multiplier. * For set representing all notes of Western major scale: [1 ] the LCD is 24 therefore T = . * For set representing all notes of a major triad: [1 ] the LCD is 4 therefore T = . * For set representing all notes of a minor triad: [1 ] the LCD is 10 therefore T = . If no least common denominator exists, for instance if one of the above elements were irrational, then the wave would not be periodic.https://www.ece.rice.edu/~srs1/files/Lec6.pdf See also * Continuous wave * List of periodic functions * Periodic sequence * Almost periodic function * Amplitude * Definite pitch * Doubly periodic function * Frequency * Oscillation * Quasiperiodic function * Wavelength * Periodic summation * Seasonality * Secular variation References * External links Periodic functions at MathWorld Category:Calculus Category:Elementary mathematics Category:Fourier analysis Category:Types of functions ","title":"Periodic function"},{"id":"76861","text":"Julius Petersen. Julius Peter Christian Petersen (16 June 1839, Sor√∏, West Zealand - 5 August 1910, Copenhagen) was a Danish mathematician. His contributions to the field of mathematics led to the birth of graph theory. Biography Petersen's interests in mathematics were manifold, including: geometry, complex analysis, number theory, mathematical physics, mathematical economics, cryptography and graph theory. His famous paper Die Theorie der regul√§ren graphs was a fundamental contribution to modern graph theory as we know it today. In 1898, he presented a counterexample to Tait's claimed theorem about 1-factorability of 3-regular graphs, which is nowadays known as the \\"Petersen graph\\". In cryptography and mathematical economics he made contributions which today are seen as pioneering. He published a systematic treatment of geometrical constructions (with straightedge and compass) in 1880. A French translation was reprinted in 1990. A special issue of Discrete Mathematics has been dedicated to the 150th birthday of Petersen. Petersen, as he claimed, had a very independent way of thinking. In order to preserve this independence he made a habit to read as little as possible of other people‚Äôs mathematics, pushing it to extremes. The consequences for his lack of knowledge of the literature of the time were severe. He spent a significant part of his time rediscovering already known results, in other cases already existing results had to be removed from a submitted paper and in other more serious cases a paper did not get published at all. He started from very modest beginnings, and by hard work, some luck and some good connections, moved steadily upward to a station of considerable importance. In 1891 his work received royal recognition through the award of the Order of the Dannebrog. Among mathematicians he enjoyed an international reputation. At his death ‚Äìwhich was front page news in Copenhagen‚Äì the socialist newspaper Social-Demokraten correctly sensed the popular appeal of his story: here was a kind of Hans Christian Andersen of science, a child of the people who had made good in the intellectual world. Early life and education Peter Christian Julius Petersen was born on the 16th of June 1839 in Sor√∏ on Zealand. His parents were Jens Petersen (1803‚Äì1873), a dyer by profession, and Anna Cathrine Petersen (1813‚Äì1896), born Wiuff. He had two younger brothers, Hans Christian Rudolf Petersen (1844‚Äì1868) and Carl Sophus Valdemar Petersen (1846‚Äì1935), and two sisters, Nielsine Cathrine Marie Petersen (1837‚Äì?) and Sophie Caroline Petersen (1842‚Äì?). After preparation in a private school, he was admitted in 1849 into second grade at the Sor√∏ Academy, a prestigious boarding school. He was taken out of school after his confirmation in 1854, because his parents could not afford to keep him there, and he worked as an apprentice for almost a year in an uncle‚Äôs grocery in Kolding, Jutland. The uncle died, however, and left Petersen a sum of money that enabled him to return to Sor√∏, pass the real-examination in 1856 with distinction, and begin his studies at the Polytechnical College in Copenhagen. In 1860 Petersen passed the first part of the civil engineering examination. By that same year he had decided to study mathematics at the university, rather than to continue with the more practical second part of the engineering education. However, his inheritance was used up and he now had to teach to make a living. From 1859 to 1871 he taught at one of Copenhagen's most prestigious private high-schools, the von Westenske Institut, with occasional part-time teaching jobs at other private schools. In 1862 he passed the student-examination, and could now enter the university. In 1866 Julius Petersen obtained the degree of magister in mathematics at the University, and by 1871 he obtained the Dr. Phil. Degree at Copenhagen University. In his doctorvita written for the university, Petersen wrote: \\"Mathematics had, from the time I started to learn it, taken my complete interest, and most of my work consisted in solving problems of my own and my friends, and in seeking the trisection of the angle, a problem that has had a great influence on my whole development\\". In the summer of 1871 he married Laura Kirstine Bertelsen (1837‚Äì1901) and seven months later the couple had their first son Aage Wiuff-Petersen (1863‚Äì1927). Later the family increased with another son, Thor Ejnar Petersen (1867‚Äì1946), and a daughter, Agnete Helga Kathrine Petersen (1872‚Äì1941). Work Many of Petersen‚Äôs early contributions to mathematics were mainly focused on geometry. During the 1860s he wrote five textbooks along with some papers, all on geometry. One of his most remarkable works was a book, ‚ÄòMethods and Theories‚Äô. The first edition of this book appeared only in Danish, but the 1879 edition was translated into eight different languages including English, French, and Spanish, earning him an international reputation more than any of his other works. In graph theory, two of Petersen‚Äôs most famous contributions are: the Petersen graph, exhibited in 1898, served as a counterexample to Tait‚Äôs ‚Äòtheorem‚Äô on the 4-colour problem: a bridgeless 3-regular graph is factorable into three 1-factors and the theorem: ‚Äòa connected 3-regular graph with at most two leaves contains a 1-factor‚Äô. In 1891 Petersen published a paper in the Acta Mathematica (volume 15, pages 193‚Äì220) entitled ‚ÄòDie Theorie der regularen graphs‚Äô. It was the first paper containing (correct) results explicitly in graph theory. The paper consisted of four major parts: :(i) The transformation of the original algebraic problem into a graph theoretical one :(ii) The problem of factorizing regular graphs of even degree. Here Petersen proves his first major result, viz. that any such graph has a 2-factorization (2-factor theorem). :(iii) Criteria for the existence of edge-separating factorizations of 4-regular graphs. :(iv) The factorization of regular graphs of odd degree, in particular, the theorem that any bridgeless 3-regular graph can be decomposed into a l-factor and a 2-factor (Petersen's theorem). Between 1887 and 1895 Petersen also contributed to mathematics with different models and instruments. one of these models was a ‚Äòeine Serie von kinematischen Modellen‚Äô which in 1888 was asked by ‚ÄòVerlagsbuchhandler L. Brill‚Äô for permission to produce and sell. In 1887 Petersen had constructed another model; a planimeter which was presented to the Royal Danish Academy of Science and Letters. It consisted of an arm, of, whose one end o is fixed to the paper by a lead cylinder with a pin p, and whose other end f is connected to a second arm dc (or df) of length L. When the stylus d is moved around the domain once, the area is measured as L‚à´dh, where dh is the differential displacement of the arm dc orthogonal to itself. Last years In the spring of 1908 Petersen suffered a stroke. But even in this condition his optimism and desire to work did not stop him. In a letter to Mittag-Leffler in Stockholm he wrote: ‚ÄúI feel in all respects rather well, it is only that I cannot walk and have difficulties in talking. However I hope to get so far this summer that I can resume my lectures in the autumn‚Äù. His last two years became a period of physical and mental debility, where, towards the end, he hardly had any memory left of his wide interests and the rich work which had filled his life. In 1909 he retired from his professorship. He died on August 5, 1910, after having been hospitalized for five months. He was buried at Vestre Kirkegaard, where Copenhagen University cared for his grave until 1947. See also *Petersen's theorem *Petersen‚ÄìMorley theorem References * K. Andersen and T.

Established in 1829 by the Hudson's Bay Company, in 1844 it became the first U.S. city west of the Rocky Mountains to be incorporated. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 31,859.  History  Detail (see also gallery below) from Oregon City on the Willamette River by John Mix Stanley, c. 1850s (Amon Carter Museum of American Art) Known in recent decades as the site of several large paper mills on the Willamette River, the city played a significant role in the early history of the Oregon Country. It was established by Hudson's Bay Company's Dr. John McLoughlin in 1829 near the confluence of the Clackamas River with the Willamette to take advantage of the power of Willamette Falls to run a lumber mill. During the 1840s and 1850s it was the destination for those wanting to file land claims after traveling the Oregon Trail as the last stop on the trail.The Oregon Trail: Oregon City It was the capital of the Oregon Territory from its establishment in 1848 until 1851, and rivaled Portland for early supremacy in the area. In 1846, the city's newspaper, the Oregon Spectator, was the first American newspaper to be published west of the Rocky Mountains. Oregon City College was established in 1849 as a Baptist school, but was defunct by the 1870s. Oregon City was the site of the Beaver Coins Mint, producing the short-lived independent Oregon Territory currency in 1849. The center of the city retains part of its historic character through the preservation of houses and other buildings from the era of the city's founding. = Former Latin archdiocese = The town became the see city of the first Roman Catholic archdiocese in the western United States, when the diocese of Oregon City, established in 1846, was raised to metropolitan rank, with Archbishop Fran√ßois Norbert Blanchet as its ordinary. Its territory included all of the western United States. The population in the area of Oregon City declined due to the California Gold Rush. The population of nearby Portland grew, and the headquarters of the archdiocese was moved there in 1926. In 1928 the name Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon replaced the former name. No longer a residential bishopric, Oregon City is now a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 945  Neighborhoods  Sketch of $5 & $10 Beaver Coins Oregon City has several neighborhoods represented by official neighborhood associations: * The Park Place neighborhood is in the northeastern corner of the city, located on a bluff overlooking Abernethy Green. The neighborhood includes a housing project, as well as numerous rural properties. Park Place, formerly an independent community, also includes unincorporated areas outside the city limits. First called Clackamas (a name that was later given to a community three miles (5 km) north), then Paper Mill, the community was finally named Park Place for a park in a nearby oak grove. Park Place was platted in 1889, and a post office was established the following year. For a while the name was changed to \\"Parkplace.\\" * The Two Rivers neighborhood is the primarily commercial lowest-elevation area of town including downtown Oregon City, the End of the Oregon Trail Visitor's Center at Abernethy Green, and Clackamette Park. It borders the Clackamas and Willamette rivers to the north and west and Park Place to the east and McLoughlin to the south. I-205 runs through the north part of the neighborhood. * The McLoughlin neighborhood is bordered by Washington Street and Singer Hill on the Northwest, a bluff overlooking Abernethy Creek on the northeast and east, and Division Street on the south. It also includes extends to the west to border the Canemah district. The John McLoughlin House and the upper entrance to the Municipal Elevator are located in this neighborhood. * The Barclay Hills neighborhood lies between Rivercrest Neighborhood on the west, the city limits on the east, the McLoughlin Neighborhood on the north, and Warner-Milne Road on the south. This neighborhood is bisected by Molalla Avenue, the former route of Oregon Route 213 before it was moved to the Oregon City Bypass to the east. * The Canemah neighborhood lies along Oregon Route 99E, and is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between the Willamette River and a bluff. Canemah was once an independent city before being annexed into Oregon City. Canemah was founded in 1845 and was the portage site around Willamette Falls for many years. It was supposedly named after an Indian chief. * The Rivercrest neighborhood includes Rivercrest Park, and the residential communities overlooking the Willamette River to the west. * The South End neighborhood lies to the southwest of Rivercrest Neighborhood. It centers around the intersection of South End and Warner-Parrot roads, and was the location of Oregon City's (now defunct) drive-in movie theater. * The Hazel Grove/Westling Farm neighborhood lies in the southwestern corner of the city, lying between the bluffs over the Willamette River and the unincorporated areas to the south. * The Tower Vista neighborhood lies southeast of South End, and east of Hazel Grove/Whistling Farm. It is bordered on the east and southeast by Leland Road. * The Hillendale neighborhood lies south of Warner-Milne Road, east of Leland Road, north of Clairmont Way and Beavercreek Road, and west of OR 213 and the city limits. The former site of City Hall is located here, as is the Clackamas County jail. * The Gaffney Lane neighborhood, centered around the elementary school of the same name, lies south of Hillendale, west of OR 213, and north/east of the city limits. * The Caufield neighborhood contains those parts of the city located south of Park Place, and east of OR 213. Clackamas Community College is located here, as is Oregon City High School.  Geography  The town is divided into upper and lower areas. The lower area is on a bench next to the Willamette River. The upper area is atop a bluff composed of Canemah basalt, which flowed about 2.5 million years ago from a vent to the southeast in the Boring Lava Field. For many years, Indian trails connected the two levels, but stairs were built in the 19th century. In 1915 the town built the water-powered Oregon City Municipal Elevator to connect the two parts, which was converted to electricity in the 1920s. In 1952, a new electric elevator was constructed with the specification that it was to be \\"as plain as possible and without ornament.\\" According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The major waterways of Oregon City include the Willamette River, which flows along the northwest side of the city, and the Clackamas River, which merges with the larger Willamette to the north of the city. The Willamette forms the boundary between Oregon City and West Linn; the Clackamas serves as the boundary between Oregon City and Gladstone. = Willamette Falls = The Willamette Falls Locks in West Linn were the first multi-lift navigational locks in the United States and are now a National Historical Site, no longer in use. The first long-distance electrical service in the United States originated in Oregon City in 1889, transmitting electricity to Portland. = Climate = Oregon City has a Mediterranean climate. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Economy  Willamette Falls and a paper mill at Oregon City, on the Willamette River For much of its existence, Oregon City's economy has been dominated by the forestry industry, until the decline of the Pacific Northwest lumber industry started in the 1980s. At its height, several mills operated in the city and surrounding communities. The last paper mill in the immediate vicinity closed in 2017. With the growth of the Portland Metro region, Oregon City has become largely a suburb of Portland. Tourism is a growing sector with the emphasis on the city's history and the major renovation of the Willamette Falls into a public-access mixed- use space through the Willamette Falls Legacy Project.  Government  Oregon City is governed by a Mayor and a City Commission composed of the Mayor and four Commissioners elected from the City at large for terms of four years each. Oregon City was the capital of the Oregon Territory until 1851; the following governors served during that time: *George Abernethy, provisional governor of the Oregon Country 1845‚Äì48 *Joseph Lane, first governor of the Oregon Territory, 1848‚Äì50 *Kintzing Prichette, 2nd Territorial Governor of Oregon, 1850 *John P. Gaines, 3rd Territorial Governor of Oregon, 1850‚Äì53. During his term (and against his wishes), the territorial capital of Oregon moved to Salem.  Education  The city, and several surrounding communities, is served by the Oregon City School District,Oregon City School District official website a public school district consisting of 7 elementary schools, two middle schools, a traditional four-year high school (Oregon City High School), and an alternative secondary school. Several schools in the district offer bilingual English/Spanish programs. Oregon City High School is the third most populated high school in Oregon, and is a state and national power in girls' basketball, winning three consecutive USA Today girls' national championships in the 1990s. The city also is the home of Clackamas Community College, numerous private and parochial schools, and a public library that is part of the Library Information Network of Clackamas County.  Points of interest  =Museums and historic buildings= Municipal Elevator in Oregon City Museums include the Museum of the Oregon Territory and the End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, with costumed \\"living history\\" guides. The Clackamas County Historical Society archives, housed in the Museum of the Oregon Territory, also include the incorporation plat for the city of San Francisco. Clackamas Heritage Partners owns and operates these museums, along with the Stevens Crawford Museum. In 2009, Clackamas Heritage Partners announced that it could no longer afford to keep the museums open. The End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center was closed to the public indefinitely in September 2009; the Stevens Crawford Museum and Museum of the Oregon Territory, staffed largely by volunteers, continued to operate on a limited schedule. The End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center eventually reopened during the summer of 2013 with the support of grants and donations from numerous sources. The Stevens-Crawford Heritage House Museum is a 1908 structure with 11 furnished rooms; exhibiting furniture from the collection of the Clackamas County Historical Society to replicate an Edwardian era home and Progressive Era narrative. Other historical buildings in Oregon City include the McLoughlin House, the Ermatinger House (oldest in Clackamas County), the Ainsworth House, the Harvey Cross House, and the First Congregational Church. The Oregon City Bridge over the Willamette River, built in 1922, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the Oregon City Municipal Elevator. =Parks= Oregon City has over 22 city parks. One of the city's larger parks is Clackamette Park, at the confluence of the Clackamas and Willamette Rivers. The park's features include RV camping, a boat launch and dock, a skateboard park, and other recreational facilities. Several community festivals are held there throughout the year. Other major parks include Chapin, Hillendale, Rivercrest, and the new Wesley Lynn. Transportation =Road= Main Street c. 1920 Interstate 205 passes through the city's northern edge, and is the only freeway to serve the city. In addition, three state highways (Oregon Route 43, Oregon Route 99E, and Oregon Route 213) pass through or terminate in Oregon City. The former two serve the city's downtown core, the latter provides service to the southern parts of Oregon City. =Rail= The Union Pacific Railroad mainline passes through the city. The city also has an Amtrak station, which is served twice daily in each direction by Amtrak Cascades trains running between Portland and Eugene, Oregon. The Coast Starlight (Seattle-Los Angeles) passes through but does not stop. =Air= There are no public airports within the city. A small private airfield is along Beavercreek Road, south of Oregon City. Oregon City is served by Portland International Airport, to the north, and by Portland-Mulino Airport, a general-aviation facility in the town of Mulino, approximately to the south. =Water= The Willamette River in Oregon City is navigable to small craft, and Oregon City has a thriving fishing and recreational boating industry. The Willamette Falls Locks allow boats to navigate around the falls. The Clackamas River is not navigable, except for the lowermost portions. =Mass transit= As part of the greater Portland metropolitan area, Oregon City is served by TriMet, the regional transit authority, with several bus lines which converge at the Oregon City Transit Center. Until 1958, an interurban trolley line operated by the now-defunct Portland Traction Company connected Oregon City with Portland; remnants of this line are still visible (such as an abandoned bridge across the Clackamas River, just east of the OR 99E bridge). In more recent years, the city operated a \\"historic trolley\\" service during the summer months, primarily to serve the needs of tourism, but the vehicles used were trolley-replica buses, rather than actual trolley cars, and in 2013 it was decided to discontinue that service and sell the vehicles. Two other public agencies provide transit service in Oregon City, supplementing that of TriMet. The South Clackamas Transportation District (SCTD) operates a route between Clackamas Community College on the south east end of Oregon City to Molalla, about south on Oregon Route 213. Canby Area Transit (CAT) operates regular service on Oregon Route 99E between the Oregon City Transit Center and Canby. SMART, South Metro Area Regional Transit, serving Wilsonville, connects to CAT in Canby. CAT also has service to Woodburn. Dial-a-ride service is operated by TriMet, but CAT also operates within the Oregon City city limits for trips originating or terminating in the CAT service area. If transfers between TriMet and CAT are necessary, they are accomplished at the Oregon City Transit Center (OCTC) at 11th & Main, which is at the northeast end of the downtown area.  Demographics  =2010 census= As of the census of 2010, there were 31,859 people, 11,973 households, and 8,206 families residing in the city. The population density was .

In 1816 he was appointed head of 'antiquarian' collections which later developed into the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. While organizing and classifying the antiquities for exhibition, he decided to present them chronologically according to the three-age system. Other scholars had previously proposed that prehistory had advanced from an age of stone tools, to ages of tools made from bronze and iron, but these proposals were presented as systems of evolution, which did not allow dating of artifacts. Thomsen refined the three-age system as a chronological system by seeing which artifacts occurred with which other artifacts in closed finds. In this way, he was the first to establish an evidence-based division of prehistory into discrete periods. This achievement led to his being credited as the originator of the three-age system of European antiquity. Thomsen also wrote one of the first systematic treatises on gold bracteates of the Migration period. Thomsen's study of artifacts within the Copenhagen museum were based on associations between stylistic change, decoration and context; he recognised the importance of examining objects from \\"closed finds\\", allowing him to determine the associations of common artifacts for various periods (stone - bronze - iron). His results were published in the Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed (Guideline to Scandinavian Antiquity) in 1836. An English translation was produced in 1848. Early life Christian Jurgensen Thomsen was born in Copenhagen in 1788 into a wealthy merchant family. As a young man he visited Paris and, once he had returned to Denmark, became interested in coin collecting. This may have helped him develop his awareness of stylistic change through time.Trigger, B. 2006, p. 122 Contributions to archaeology Thomsen showing visitors around the collection in 1848. Contemporary drawing. In 1816 Thomsen was selected to curate Danish Royal Commission for the Collection and Preservation of Antiquities' first exhibition. As the post was unsalaried, Thomsen's independent means and his experience as a collector of coins were his primary qualifications.Trigger, B. 2006, p. 127 He probably knew of the three-age model of prehistory through the works of Lucretius, Vedel Simonsen, Montfaucon and Mahudel, and decided to sort the material in the collection chronologically.Heizer 1962 Before Thomsen, this might have been done by mechanically sorting the materials according to their materials or the level of craftsmanship they displayed, but as the provenance of many of the materials were known, he could see that crude artifacts were sometimes found with fine ones and metal artifacts with artifacts of stone. Rather than take a simple technological or evolutionary approach, he realized that the task was to determine in which periods the artifacts had been made. Thomsen decided to map out which kinds of phenomena co-occurred in deposits and which did not, as this would allow him to discern any trends that were exclusive to certain periods. In this way he discovered that stone tools were found in connection with amber, pottery, glass beads, whereas bronze was found with both iron and gold, but silver was only found in connection with iron. He also found that bronze weapons did not occur with iron artifacts - so that each period could be defined by its preferred cutting material. He also found that the types of grave goods varied between burial types: stone tools were found with uncremated corpses and stone-chamber tombs, bronze weapons and lurs in relation to stone-schist graves, and iron with chamber tombs in barrows. Thomsen was the first to use the terms Stone Age, Bronze Age and the Iron Age. When detractors asked rhetorically why there was no ‚Äùglass age,‚Äù Thomsen responded that glass beads were found in all three periods, but bowls of glass only in the Iron Age. To Thomsen the find circumstances were the key to dating. As early as 1821, he wrote in a letter to fellow antiquarian Schr√∂der that, ‚Äù[n]othing is more important than to point out that hitherto we have not paid enough attention to what was found together,‚Äù and, the next year, that ‚Äù[we] still do not know enough about most of the antiquities either ‚Ä¶ only future archaeologists may be able to decide, but they will never be able to do so if they do not observe what things are found together and our collections are not brought to a greater degree of perfection.‚ÄùGr√§slund 1987:23 This analysis emphasizing co-occurrence and systematic attention to archaeological context allowed Thomsen to build a chronological framework of the materials in the collection and to classify new finds in relation to the established chronology, even without much knowledge of its provenience. In this way, Thomsen's system was a true chronological system rather than an evolutionary or technological system.Gr√§slund 1987:22, 28 His chronology was established by 1825,Gr√§slund 1987:19 and visitors to the museum were instructed in his methods. Thomsen also published journal articles and pamphlets in which he emphasized the importance of the find circumstances for later interpretation and dating.Gr√§slund 1987:24 Finally, in 1836, he published the illustrated monograph Guide to Northern Antiquity, in which he described his chronology together with comments about which things occurred together in finds. Like previous antiquarians, such as Winckelmann,Trigger 2006:57-8 Thomsen paid attention to stylistic analysis as well, but he used his chronological framework as evidence that stylistic developments had taken place, not the other way round. Thomsen may have been able to make his early advances in the development of archaeology because he had such a wide variety of material to review, consisting of collective finds from a large relatively homogeneous culture area. He was the first to develop it into a chronological system rather than a speculative evolutionary model.Gr√§slund 1987:29 Thomsen was an important influence on subsequent generations of prehistorians in Scandinavia, and he taught his methods to archaeologists such as J. J. A. Worsaae and Bror Emil Hildebrand and later Oscar Montelius. He also importantly influenced and was influenced by contemporary Swedish prehistorians such as Sven Nilsson. Thomsen's Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed (Guideline to Scandinavian Antiquity)(1836) was published in English in 1848. Worsaae's The Primeval Antiquities of Denmark was published in English in 1849; the two works were highly influential on the development of archaeology theory and practice in Great Britain and the United States. Influence on art Together with Niels Laurits H√∏yen, Thomsen had great influence on the arts in Copenhagen. He was active as a board in the influential Kunstforeningen (Art Society) in the 1830s when its member numbers and position peaked. In 1839 he was appointed as inspector at the Royal Painting Collection alongside Niels Laurits H√∏yen. Many private collectors also consulted Thomsen. References  Bibliography *Conn, Steven (2004).

Although dogs can be trained to navigate various obstacles, they are red‚Äìgreen color blind and incapable of interpreting street signs. The human does the directing, based on skills acquired through previous mobility training. The handler might be likened to an aircraft's navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog is the pilot, who gets them there safely. In several countries guide dogs, along with most service and hearing dogs, are exempt from regulations against the presence of animals in places such as restaurants and public transportation. History A blind man with his guide dog in Montreal, 1941. References to service animals date at least as far back as the mid-16th century. The second line of the popular verse alphabet \\"A was an Archer\\" is most commonly \\"B was a Blind-man/Led by a dog\\". In Elizabeth Barrett Browning's 19th-century verse novel Aurora Leigh, the title character remarks, \\"The blind man walks wherever the dog pulls / And so I answered.\\" Evidence suggests that dogs may have been used as guides for the visually impaired based on depictions of a blind-man being guided by his dog on the wall of a house buried when Vesuvius erupted in 79 CEG. A. Fishman, ‚ÄúWhen your eyes have a wet nose: the evolution of the use of guide dogs and establishing the seeing eye,‚Äù Survey of Ophthalmology, vol. 48, no. 4, pp. 452‚Äì458, Jul. 2003, doi: 10.1016/S0039-6257(03)00052-3.. This and other visual depictions indicate that dogs have been common companions for the blind for thousands of years. Additional material evidence would be required to positively assess their use specifically as guides. The first service animal training schools were established in Germany during World War I, to enhance the mobility of returning veterans who were blinded in combat. Interest in service animals outside of Germany did not become widespread until Dorothy Harrison Eustis, an American dog breeder living in Switzerland, wrote a first-hand account about a service animal training school in Potsdam, Germany, that was published in The Saturday Evening Post in 1927. That same year, United States Senator Thomas D. Schall of Minnesota was paired with a service animal imported from Germany, who was trained by the owner of LaSalle Kennels, Jack Sinykin of Minnesota. The service animal movement did not take hold in America until Nashville resident Morris Frank returned from Switzerland after being trained with one of Eustis's dogs, a female German shepherd named Buddy. Frank and Buddy embarked on a publicity tour to convince Americans of the abilities of service animals and the need to allow people with service animals access to public transportation, hotels, and other areas open to the public. In 1929, Eustis and Frank co-founded The Seeing Eye school in Nashville, Tennessee (relocated in 1931 to New Jersey). The first service animals in Great Britain were German Shepherds. Four of these first were Flash, Judy, Meta, and Folly, who were handed over to their new owners, veterans blinded in World War I, on 6 October 1931 in Wallasey, Merseyside. Judy's new owner was Musgrave Frankland.Article, The London Paper at exacteditions.com In 1934, The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in Great Britain began operation, although their first permanent trainer was a Russian military officer, Captain Nikolai Liakhoff, who moved to the UK in 1933. Elliott S. Humphrey, an animal breeder who trained the first guide dogs for the blind used in the United States. Mr. Humphrey was hired to breed German shepherds at a center in Switzerland that had been set up by Dorothy Harrison Eustis of Philadelphia and began the work that led to the Seeing-Eye Dog program. The first dogs produced at the center, known as Fortunate Fields, were used for military and police work and for tracking missing persons. Then Mr. Humphrey trained German shepherds to guide the blind. The Germans had developed a guide dog program during World War I, but Mr. Humphrey devised different procedures and it is his that are followed in the United States Research Important studies on the behavior and training methods of service animals were done in the 1920s and 1930s by Jakob von Uexk√ºll and Emanuel Georg Sarris. They studied the value of service animals and introduced advanced methods of training. There have also been important studies into the discrimination experienced by people that use service and assistance animals. Breeds Labrador Retriever guide dogs resting Labrador guide dog standing with its handler. Guide dog breeds are chosen for temperament and trainability. At the moment Golden Retrievers, Labradors, Standard Poodles, German Shepherds, and Golden Retriever/Labrador crosses are most likely to be chosen by service animal facilities. The most popular breed used globally today is the Labrador Retriever. This breed has a good range of size, is easily kept due to its short coat, is generally healthy and has a gentle but willing temperament. Crosses such as the Goldador (Golden Retriever/Labrador), combine the sensitivity of the Golden Retriever and the tolerance of the Labrador Retriever and Labradoodles (Labrador/Poodles are bred to help reduce allergens as all breeds shed but levels vary) are also common. Some schools, such as the Guide Dog Foundation, have added Standard Poodles to their breed registry. Although German Shepherds were once a common breed used for guide work, many schools have discontinued using these dogs due to the skills and unwavering leadership role required by the handler to keep the breed active and non-destructive. Accessibility A guide dog-in- training Israel Despite regulations or rules that deny access to animals in restaurants and other public places, in many countries, service animals are protected by law and therefore may accompany their handlers most places that are open to the public. Laws and regulations vary worldwide: *In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits any business, government agency, or other organization that provides access to the general public from barring service animals, except where their presence would cause a health or safety risk. However, religious organizations are not required to provide such access. Whether service animals in training have the same rights or not usually falls on each individual state government. In addition, the Fair Housing Act requires that landlords allow tenants to have service animals, as well as other types of assistance animals, in residences that normally have a No Pets policy and that no extra fees may be charged for such tenants. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity investigates complaints from the public alleging denials of reasonable accommodation requests involving assistance animals. *In the United Kingdom the Equality Act 2010 provides for people with disabilities to have the same right to services supplied by shops, banks, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis and restaurants as everyone else. Service providers have to make \\"reasonable adjustments\\" to accommodate service animals and assistance animal owners. Under Part 12 of the EA it is illegal for assistance animal owners to be refused access to a taxi or minicab with their assistance animal, but medical exemptions are available if drivers have a certificate from their GPs. *In most South American countries and Mexico, service animal access depends solely upon the goodwill of the owner or manager. In more tourist-heavy areas, service animals are generally welcomed without problems. In Brazil, however, a 2006 federal decree requires allowance of service animals in all public and open-to-public places. The Bras√≠lia Metro has developed a program that trains service animals to ride it. *In Malta, the Equal Opportunities Act 2000 (Cap. 413) states that it is illegal to discriminate against a disabled person who needs an assistant, in this case, a service animal. The few exceptions are restaurant kitchens, hospital special wards, toilets and premises where other animals are kept. *In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 protects service animals handlers. Each state and territory has its own laws, which may differ slightly. *In Canada, service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed.

Discrimination Since some schools of thought in Islam consider dogs in general to be unclean,Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature, s.v. \\"Dogs in the Islamic Tradition and Nature.\\" New York: Continuum International, forthcoming 2004. By: Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl Muslim taxi drivers and store owners have sometimes refused to accommodate customers who have service animals, which has led to discrimination charges against them. However, in 2003 the Islamic Sharia Council, a British organization that provides non-binding guidance on interpreting Islamic religious law, ruled that the ban on dogs does not apply to those used for guide work. Benefits of owning a guide dog Social psychologist Elliot Aronson and his guide dog, Desilu, whom he received in January 2011 Studies show owning a pet or therapy animal offers positive effects psychologically, socially, and physiologically. Guide dogs especially come with a variety of benefits and help in many ways. They give a blind person more confidence, friendship, and security. Blind people who use service animals have increased confidence in going about day-to-day life and are comforted by a constant friend. Companionship offered by a service dog helps reduce anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Animals offer support, security, and companionship, stress is reduced, which in turn improves cardiovascular health. Guide dogs make it easier to get around, resulting in the person getting more exercise or walking more. People are more willing to go places and feel a sense of independence. Meeting people and socializing is easier, and people are more likely to offer a blind person help when there is a service animal present. The animals may also lead to increased interaction with other people. Animals are seen as \\"ice breakers\\" to a conversation with something to talk about. They are more advantageous than long canes when one is in an unfamiliar place. The animal directs the right path, instead of poking around wondering if you might bump into something. Guide dogs make the experience of the unknown more relaxing. Getting from point A to point B using a guide dog is much faster and safer. Owners of guide dogs share a special bond with their animal. Many report that the animal is a member of the family and, often, the handler goes to their animal for comfort and support. The animal isn't seen as a working animal, but more as a loyal friend. However, it is important to remember that guide dogs are working animals and should not be distracted or treated as a pet while they are working. People often have misconceptions about guide dogs, including believing they work all the time. In reality, the dogs usually work only when their handler leaves their residence. The dogs are not GPSes and don't guide the person where they are going. The handler tells the dog where they want to go, and the dogs are taught intelligent disobedience ‚Äî blocking the handler from proceeding when there is an unsafe situation.

Soft rock mining refers to excavation of softer minerals such as salt, coal, or oil sands. Mine access =Underground access= Accessing underground ore can be achieved via a decline (ramp), inclined vertical shaft or adit. Decline portal *Declines can be a spiral tunnel which circles either the flank of the deposit or circles around the deposit. The decline begins with a box cut, which is the portal to the surface. Depending on the amount of overburden and quality of bedrock, a galvanized steel culvert may be required for safety purposes. They may also be started into the wall of an open cut mine. *Shafts are vertical excavations sunk adjacent to an ore body. Shafts are sunk for ore bodies where haulage to surface via truck is not economical. Shaft haulage is more economical than truck haulage at depth, and a mine may have both a decline and a ramp. *Adits are horizontal excavations into the side of a hill or mountain. Adits are used for horizontal or near- horizontal ore bodies where there is no need for a ramp or shaft. Declines are often started from the side of the high wall of an open cut mine when the ore body is of a payable grade sufficient to support an underground mining operation, but the strip ratio has become too great to support open cast extraction methods. They are also often built and maintained as an emergency safety access from the underground workings and a means of moving large equipment to the workings. =Ore access.= Levels are excavated horizontally off the decline or shaft to access the ore body. Stopes are then excavated perpendicular (or near perpendicular) to the level into the ore. Development mining vs. production mining There are two principal phases of underground mining: development mining and production mining. Development mining is composed of excavation almost entirely in (non-valuable) waste rock in order to gain access to the orebody. There are six steps in development mining: remove previously blasted material (muck out round), scaling (removing any unstable slabs of rock hanging from the roof and sidewalls to protect workers and equipment from damage), installing support or/and reinforcement using shotcrete etceteras, drill face rock, load explosives, and blast explosives. To start the mining, the first step is to make the path to go down. The path is defined as 'Decline' as describe above. Before the start of Decline all preplanning of Power facility, drilling arrangement, dewatering, ventilation and, muck withdrawal facilities are required.https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~nwormald/papers/DOT2.pdf.;Decline design in underground mines using constrained path optimisation Production mining is further broken down into two methods, long hole and short hole. Short hole mining is similar to development mining, except that it occurs in ore. There are several different methods of long hole mining. Typically, long hole mining requires two excavations within the ore at different elevations below surface, (15 m ‚Äì 30 m apart). Holes are drilled between the two excavations and loaded with explosives. The holes are blasted and the ore is removed from the bottom excavation. Ventilation Door for directing ventilation in an old lead mine. The ore hopper at the front is not part of the ventilation. One of the most important aspects of underground hard rock mining is ventilation. Ventilation is the primary method of clearing hazardous gases and/or dust which are created from drilling and blasting activity (e.g., silica dust, NOx), diesel equipment (e.g., diesel particulate, carbon monoxide), or to protect against gases that are naturally emanating from the rock (e.g., radon gas). Ventilation is also used to manage underground temperatures for the workers. In deep, hot mines ventilation is used to cool the workplace; however, in very cold locations the air is heated to just above freezing before it enters the mine. Ventilation raises are typically used to transfer ventilation from surface to the workplaces, and can be modified for use as emergency escape routes. The primary sources of heat in underground hard rock mines are virgin rock temperature, machinery, auto compression, and fissure water. Other small contributing factors are human body heat and blasting. Ground support Some means of support is required in order to maintain the stability of the openings that are excavated. This support comes in two forms; local support and area support. =Area ground support= Area ground support is used to prevent major ground failure. Holes are drilled into the back (ceiling) and walls and a long steel rod (or rock bolt) is installed to hold the ground together. There are three categories of rock bolt, differentiated by how they engage the host rock. They are: Mechanical bolts *Point anchor bolts (or expansion shell bolts) are a common style of area ground support. A point anchor bolt is a metal bar between 20 mm ‚Äì 25 mm in diameter, and between 1 m ‚Äì 4 m long (the size is determined by the mine's engineering department). There is an expansion shell at the end of the bolt which is inserted into the hole. As the bolt is tightened by the installation drill the expansion shell expands and the bolt tightens holding the rock together. Mechanical bolts are considered temporary support as their lifespan is reduced by corrosion as they are not grouted. Grouted bolts *Resin grouted rebar is used in areas which require more support than a point anchor bolt can give. The rebar used is of similar size as a point anchor bolt but does not have an expansion shell. Once the hole for the rebar is drilled, cartridges of polyester resin are installed in the hole. The rebar bolt is installed after the resin and spun by the installation drill. This opens the resin cartridge and mixes it. Once the resin hardens, the drill spinning tightens the rebar bolt holding the rock together. Resin grouted rebar is considered a permanent ground support with a lifespan of 20‚Äì30 years. *Cable bolts are used to bind large masses of rock in the hanging wall and around large excavations. Cable bolts are much larger than standard rock bolts and rebar, usually between 10‚Äì25 metres long. Cable bolts are grouted with a cement grout. Friction bolts *Friction stabilizer (frequently called by the genericized trademark Split Set) are much easier to install than mechanical bolts or grouted bolts. The bolt is hammered into the drill hole, which has a smaller diameter than the bolt. Pressure from the bolt on the wall holds the rock together. Friction stabilizers are particularly susceptible to corrosion and rust from water unless they are grouted. Once grouted the friction increases by a factor of 3-4. *Swellex is similar to Friction stabilizers, except the bolt diameter is smaller than the hole diameter. High pressure water is injected into the bolt to expand the bolt diameter to hold the rock together. Like the friction stabilizer, swellex is poorly protected from corrosion and rust. =Local ground support= Local ground support is used to prevent smaller rocks from falling from the back and ribs. Not all excavations require local ground support. *Welded Wire Mesh is a metal screen with 10 cm x 10 cm (4 inch) openings. The mesh is held to the back using point anchor bolts or resin grouted rebar. *Shotcrete is fibre reinforced spray on concrete which coats the back and ribs preventing smaller rocks from falling. Shotcrete thickness can be between 50 mm ‚Äì 100 mm. *Latex Membranes can be sprayed on the backs and ribs similar to shotcrete, but in smaller amounts. Stope and retreat vs. stope and fill =Stope and retreat= Sub-Level Caving Subsidence reaches surface at the Ridgeway underground mine. Using this method, mining is planned to extract rock from the stopes without filling the voids; this allows the wall rocks to cave in to the extracted stope after all the ore has been removed. The stope is then sealed to prevent access. =Stope and fill= Where large bulk ore bodies are to be mined at great depth, or where leaving pillars of ore is uneconomical, the open stope is filled with backfill, which can be a cement and rock mixture, a cement and sand mixture or a cement and tailings mixture. This method is popular as the refilled stopes provide support for the adjacent stopes, allowing total extraction of economic resources. Mining methods Schematic diagram of cut and fill mining The mining method selected is determined by the size, shape, orientation and type of orebody to be mined. The orebody can be narrow vein such as a gold mine in the Witwatersrand, the orebody can be massive similar to the Olympic Dam mine, South Australia, or Cadia-Ridgeway Mine, New South Wales. The width or size of the orebody is determined by the grade as well as the distribution of the ore. The dip of the orebody also has an influence on the mining method for example a narrow horizontal vein orebody will be mined by room and pillar or a longwall method whereas a vertical narrow vein orebody will be mined by an open stoping or cut and fill method. Further consideration is needed for the strength of the ore as well as the surrounding rock. An orebody hosted in strong self-supporting rock may be mined by an open stoping method and an orebody hosted in poor rock may need to be mined by a cut and fill method where the void is continuously filled as the ore is removed. =Selective mining methods= *Cut and fill mining is a method of short-hole mining used in steeply dipping or irregular ore zones, in particular where the hanging wall limits the use of long-hole methods. The ore is mined in horizontal or slightly inclined slices, and then filled with waste rock, sand or tailings. Either fill option may be consolidated with concrete or left unconsolidated. Cut and fill mining is an expensive but selective method, with the advantages of low ore loss and dilution. *Drift and fill is similar to cut and fill, except that it is used in ore zones, which are wider than the method of drifting will allow to be mined. In this case, the first drift is developed in the ore, and is backfilled using consolidated fill. The second drift is driven adjacent to the first drift. This carries on until the ore zone is mined out to its full width, at which time the second cut is started atop of the first cut. *Shrinkage stoping is a short-hole mining method which is suitable for steeply dipping orebodies. This method is similar to cut and fill mining with the exception that after being blasted, broken ore is left in the stope where it is used to support the surrounding rock and as a platform from which to work. Only enough ore is removed from the stope to allow for drilling and blasting the next slice. The stope is emptied when all of the ore has been blasted. Although it is very selective and allows for low dilution, since most of the ore stays in the stope until mining is completed, there is a delayed return on capital investments. * VRM/ VCR: Vertical retreat mining (VRM) also known as Vertical crater retreat (VCR) is a method where mine is divided in vertical zones with depth of about 50 meters using open stoping, bottom-up mining. Long-hole large-diameter holes are drilled vertically into the ore body from the top using in-the-hole (ITH)http://www.sciencechannel.com/tv- shows/dirty-great-machines/dirty-great-machines-videos/the-in-the-hole-drill/ drills, and then blasting horizontal slices of the ore body into an undercut. Ore blasted in retrieval taken in phase. This retrieval is done from bottom of the section developed. Last cleaning of ore is done through remote controlled LHD machines. A system of primary and secondary stopes is often used in VCR mining, where primary stopes are mined in the first stage and then backfilled with cemented fill to provide wall support for the blasting of successive stopes. Side chambers will be mined in pre-planned sequence after the fill has solidified.https://mining.cat.com/cda/files/2785508/7/Creighton_Eng.pdf.;VIEWPOINT: perspectives on modern mining; page 2; Quote: 'Vertical retreat mining (VRM) was introduced in the mid-1980s to replace the cut-and-fill mining method. The slot-slash mining method, a modified VRM, was introduced in the late 1990s and replaced the VRM mining.' = Bulk mining methods = *Block caving is used to mine massive steeply dipping orebodies (typically low grade) with high friability. An undercut with haulage access is driven under the orebody, with \\"drawbells\\" excavated between the top of the haulage level and the bottom of the undercut. The drawbells serve as a place for caving rock to fall into. The orebody is drilled and blasted above the undercut, and the ore is removed via the haulage access. Due to the friability of the orebody the ore above the first blast caves and falls into the drawbells. As ore is removed from the drawbells the orebody caves in, providing a steady stream of ore. If caving stops and removal of ore from the drawbells continues, a large void may form, resulting in the potential for a sudden and massive collapse and potentially catastrophic windblast throughout the mine. Where caving does continue, the ground surface may collapse into a surface depression such as those at the Climax and Henderson molybdenum mines in Colorado. Such a configuration is one of several to which miners apply the term \\"glory hole\\". Orebodies that do not cave readily are sometimes preconditioned by hydraulic fracturing, blasting, or by a combination of both. Hydraulic fracturing has been applied to preconditioning strong roof rock over coal longwall panels, and to inducing caving in both coal and hard rock mines. *Room and pillar mining : Room and pillar mining is commonly done in flat or gently dipping bedded ore bodies. Pillars are left in place in a regular pattern while the rooms are mined out. In many room and pillar mines, the pillars are taken out starting at the farthest point from the stope access, allowing the roof to collapse and fill in the stope. This allows for greater recovery as less ore is left behind in pillars. Ore removal In mines which use rubber tired equipment for coarse ore removal, the ore (or \\"muck\\") is removed from the stope (referred to as \\"mucked out\\" or \\"bogged\\") using center articulated vehicles (referred to as boggers or LHD (Load, Haul, Dump machine)). These pieces of equipment may operate using diesel engines or electric motors, and resemble a low-profile front end loader. LHD operated through electricity utilize trailing cables which are flexible and can be extended or retracted on a reel. http://www.mineweb.com/archive/greGreener underground mining The ore is then dumped into a truck to be hauled to the surface (in shallower mines). In deeper mines, the ore is dumped down an ore pass (a vertical or near vertical excavation) where it falls to a collection level. On the collection level, it may receive primary crushing via jaw or cone crusher, or via a rockbreaker. The ore is then moved by conveyor belts, trucks or occasionally trains to the shaft to be hoisted to the surface in buckets or skips and emptied into bins beneath the surface headframe for transport to the mill. In some cases the underground primary crusher feeds an inclined conveyor belt which delivers ore via an incline shaft direct to the surface. The ore is fed down ore passes, with mining equipment accessing the ore body via a decline from surface.

It is endemic to Australia where it is the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. The emu's range covers most of mainland Australia, but the Tasmanian, Kangaroo Island and King Island subspecies became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788. The bird is sufficiently common for it to be rated as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Emus are soft-feathered, brown, flightless birds with long necks and legs, and can reach up to in height. Emus can travel great distances, and when necessary can sprint at ; they forage for a variety of plants and insects, but have been known to go for weeks without eating. They drink infrequently, but take in copious amounts of water when the opportunity arises. Breeding takes place in May and June, and fighting among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses a significant amount of weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season. The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia, appearing on the coat of arms and various coins. The bird features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology.  Etymology  The etymology of the common name \\"emu\\" is uncertain, but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird that was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related cassowary in Australia and New Guinea. Another theory is that it comes from the word \\"ema\\", which is used in Portuguese to denote a large bird akin to an ostrich or crane. In Victoria, some terms for the emu were Barrimal in the Dja Dja Wurrung language, myoure in Gunai, and courn in Jardwadjali. The birds were known as murawung or birabayin to the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin. Taxonomy =History= Emus were first reported as having been seen by Europeans when explorers visited the western coast of Australia in 1696. This was during an expedition led by Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh who was searching for survivors of a ship that had gone missing two years earlier. The birds were known on the eastern coast before 1788, when the first Europeans settled there.Eastman, p. 5. The birds were first mentioned under the name of the \\"New Holland cassowary\\" in Arthur Phillip's Voyage to Botany Bay, published in 1789 with the following description: The species was named by ornithologist John Latham in 1790 based on a specimen from the Sydney area of Australia, a country which was known as New Holland at the time. He collaborated on Phillip's book and provided the first descriptions of, and names for, many Australian bird species; Dromaius comes from a Greek word meaning \\"racer\\" and novaehollandiae is the Latin term for New Holland, so the name can be rendered as \\"fast-footed New Hollander\\". In his original 1816 description of the emu, the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot used two generic names, first Dromiceius and later Dromaius. It has been a point of contention ever since as to which name should be used; the latter is more correctly formed, but the convention in taxonomy is that the first name given to an organism stands, unless it is clearly a typographical error. Most modern publications, including those of the Australian government, use Dromaius, with Dromiceius mentioned as an alternative spelling. =Systematics= Mounted emu skeleton Size comparison between a human, the mainland emu (centre), and the extinct King Island sub-species (right) The emu was long classified, with its closest relatives the cassowaries, in the family Casuariidae, part of the ratite order Struthioniformes. However, an alternate classification was proposed in 2014 by Mitchell et al., based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA. This splits off the Casuariidae into their own order, the Casuariformes, and includes only the cassowaries in the family Casuariidae, placing the emus in their own family, Dromaiidae. The cladogram shown below is from their study. Two different Dromaius species were present in Australia at the time of European settlement, and one additional species is known from fossil remains. The insular dwarf emus, D. n. baudinianus and D. n. minor, originally present on Kangaroo Island and King Island respectively, both became extinct shortly after the arrival of Europeans. D. n. diemenensis, another insular dwarf emu from Tasmania, became extinct around 1865. However, the mainland subspecies, D. n. novaehollandiae, remains common. The population of these birds varies from decade to decade, largely being dependent on rainfall; in 2009, it was estimated that there were between 630,000 and 725,000 birds. Emus were introduced to Maria Island off Tasmania, and Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia, during the 20th century. The Maria Island population died out in the mid-1990s. The Kangaroo Island birds have successfully established a breeding population. In 1912, the Australian ornithologist Gregory M. Mathews recognised three living subspecies of emu, D. n. novaehollandiae (Latham, 1790), D. n. woodwardi Mathews, 1912 and D. n. rothschildi Mathews, 1912. However, the Handbook of the Birds of the World argues that the last two of these subspecies are invalid; natural variations in plumage colour and the nomadic nature of the species make it likely that there is a single race in mainland Australia. Examination of the DNA of the King Island emu shows this bird to be closely related to the mainland emu and hence best treated as a subspecies.  Description  The emu is the second tallest bird in the world, only being exceeded in height by the ostrich; the largest individuals can reach up to in height. Measured from the bill to the tail, emus range in length from , with males averaging and females averaging . Emus are the fourth or fifth heaviest living bird after the two species of ostrich and two larger species of cassowary, weighing slightly more on average than an emperor penguin. Adult emus weigh between , with an average of in males and females, respectively. Females are usually slightly larger than males and are substantially wider across the rump. foot in a tridactyl arrangement, which is an adaptation for running and is seen in other birds, such as bustards and quails. The ostrich has two toes on each foot. Adult in South Eastern Australia Although flightless, emus have vestigial wings, the wing chord measuring around , and each wing having a small claw at the tip. Emus flap their wings when running, perhaps as a means of stabilising themselves when moving fast. They have long necks and legs,Eastman, p. 6. and can run at speeds of due to their highly specialised pelvic limb musculature. Their feet have only three toes and a similarly reduced number of bones and associated foot muscles; emus are unique among birds in that their gastrocnemius muscles in the back of the lower legs have four bellies instead of the usual three. The pelvic limb muscles of emus contribute a similar proportion of the total body mass as do the flight muscles of flying birds. When walking, the emu takes strides of about , but at full gallop, a stride can be as long as . Its legs are devoid of feathers and underneath its feet are thick, cushioned pads. Like the cassowary, the emu has sharp claws on its toes which are its major defensive attribute, and are used in combat to inflict wounds on opponents by kicking.Eastman, p. 7. The toe and claw total in length.Eastman, p. 9. The bill is quite small, measuring , and is soft, being adapted for grazing. Emus have good eyesight and hearing, which allows them to detect threats at some distance. Emu head and upper neck The neck of the emu is pale blue and shows through its sparse feathers. They have grey- brown plumage of shaggy appearance; the shafts and the tips of the feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the inner plumage insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during the heat of the day.Eastman, pp. 5‚Äì6. A unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a single shaft. Both of the rachis have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance,Eastman, p. 23. although the male's penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural camouflage. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months. The eyes of an emu are protected by nictitating membranes. These are translucent, secondary eyelids that move horizontally from the inside edge of the eye to the outside edge. They function as visors to protect the eyes from the dust that is prevalent in windy arid regions. Emus have a tracheal pouch, which becomes more prominent during the mating season. At more than in length, it is quite spacious; it has a thin wall, and an opening long. Distribution and habitat Adult and juvenile foot prints Once common on the east coast of Australia, emus are now uncommon there; by contrast, the development of agriculture and the provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the emu in arid regions. Emus live in various habitats across Australia both inland and near the coast. They are most common in areas of savannah woodland and sclerophyll forest, and least common in heavily populated districts and arid areas with annual precipitation of less than . Emus predominately travel in pairs, and while they can form large flocks, this is an atypical social behaviour that arises from the common need to move towards a new food source. Emus have been shown to travel long distances to reach abundant feeding areas. In Western Australia, emu movements follow a distinct seasonal pattern ‚Äì north in summer and south in winter. On the east coast their wanderings seem to be more random and do not appear to follow a set pattern.  Behaviour and ecology  Emus are diurnal birds and spend their day foraging, preening their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. They are generally gregarious birds apart from the breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river. Emus bathing on a very hot summer day in a shallow dam Emus begin to settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep continuously but rouse themselves several times during the night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface. Emu grunting and hissing; note the inflating throat The vocalisations of emus mostly consist of various booming and grunting sounds. The booming is created by the inflatable throat pouch; the pitch can be regulated by the bird and depends on the size of the aperture. Most of the booming is done by females; it is part of the courtship ritual, is used to announce the holding of territory and is issued as a threat to rivals. A high-intensity boom is audible away, while a low, more resonant call, produced during the breeding season, may at first attract mates and peaks while the male is incubating the eggs. Most of the grunting is done by males. It is used principally during the breeding season in territorial defence, as a threat to other males, during courtship and while the female is laying. Both sexes sometimes boom or grunt during threat displays or on encountering strange objects. On very hot days, emus pant to maintain their body temperature. Their lungs work as evaporative coolers and, unlike some other species, the resulting low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood do not appear to cause alkalosis. For normal breathing in cooler weather, they have large, multifolded nasal passages. Cool air warms as it passes through into the lungs, extracting heat from the nasal region. On exhalation, the emu's cold nasal turbinates condense moisture back out of the air and absorb it for reuse. As with other ratites, the emu has great homeothermic ability, and can maintain this status from . The thermoneutral zone of emus lies between . As with other ratites, emus have a relatively low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to a higher rate of heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly. = Diet = An emu foraging in grass Emus forage in a diurnal pattern and eat a variety of native and introduced plant species. The diet depends on seasonal availability with such plants as Acacia, Casuarina and grasses being favoured. They also eat insects and other arthropods, including grasshoppers and crickets, beetles, cockroaches, ladybirds, bogong and cotton-boll moth larvae, ants, spiders and millipedes. This provides a large part of their protein requirements. In Western Australia, food preferences have been observed in travelling emus; they eat seeds from Acacia aneura until the rains arrive, after which they move on to fresh grass shoots and caterpillars; in winter they feed on the leaves and pods of Cassia and in spring, they consume grasshoppers and the fruit of Santalum acuminatum, a sort of quandong. They are also known to feed on wheat,Eastman, p. 31. and any fruit or other crops that they can access, easily climbing over high fences if necessary. Emus serve as an important agent for the dispersal of large viable seeds, which contributes to floral biodiversity. One undesirable effect of this occurred in Queensland in the early twentieth century when emus fed on the fruit of prickly pears in the outback. They defecated the seeds in various places as they moved around, and this led to a series of campaigns to hunt emus and prevent the seeds of the invasive cactus being spread.Eastman, p. 44. The cacti were eventually controlled by an introduced moth (Cactoblastis cactorum) whose larvae fed on the plant, one of the earliest examples of biological control. Small stones are swallowed to assist in the grinding up and digestion of the plant material. Individual stones may weigh and the birds may have as much as in their gizzards at one time. They also eat charcoal, although the reason for this is unclear. Captive emus have been known to eat shards of glass, marbles, car keys, jewellery and nuts and bolts. Emus drink infrequently but ingest large amounts when the opportunity arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend to wait for the other animals to leave before drinking.Eastman, p. 15. = Breeding = Dark green emu egg Emus form breeding pairs during the summer months of December and January and may remain together for about five months. During this time, they stay in an area a few kilometres in diameter and it is believed they find and defend territory within this area. Both males and females put on weight during the breeding season, with the female becoming slightly heavier at between . Mating usually takes place between April and June; the exact timing is determined by the climate as the birds nest during the coolest part of the year. During the breeding season, males experience hormonal changes, including an increase in luteinising hormone and testosterone levels, and their testicles double in size. Males construct a rough nest in a semi-sheltered hollow on the ground, using bark, grass, sticks and leaves to line it. The nest is almost always a flat surface rather than a segment of a sphere, although in cold conditions the nest is taller, up to tall, and more spherical to provide some extra heat retention. When other material is lacking, the bird sometimes uses a spinifex tussock a metre or so across, despite the prickly nature of the foliage. The nest can be placed on open ground or near a shrub or rock. The nest is usually placed in an area where the emu has a clear view of its surroundings and can detect approaching predators.Eastman, p. 24. Female emus court the males; the female's plumage darkens slightly and the small patches of bare, featherless skin just below the eyes and near the beak turn turquoise-blue. The colour of the male's plumage remains unchanged, although the bare patches of skin also turn light blue. When courting, females stride around, pulling their neck back while puffing out their feathers and emitting low, monosyllabic calls that have been compared to drum beats. This calling can occur when males are out of sight or more than away. Once the male's attention has been gained, the female circles her prospective mate at a distance of . As she does this, she looks at him by turning her neck, while at the same time keeping her rump facing towards him. If the male shows interest in the parading female, he will move closer; the female continues the courtship by shuffling further away but continuing to circle him. If a male is interested, he will stretch his neck and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his advances with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump. Nest and eggs Females are more aggressive than males during the courtship period, often fighting for access to mates, with fights among females accounting for more than half the aggressive interactions during this period. If females court a male that already has a partner, the incumbent female will try to repel the competitor, usually by chasing and kicking. These interactions can be prolonged, lasting up to five hours, especially when the male being fought over is single and neither female has the advantage of incumbency. In these cases, the females typically intensify their calls and displays. The sperm from a mating is stored by the female and can suffice to fertilise about six eggs. The pair mate every day or two, and every second or third day the female lays one of a clutch of five to fifteen very large, thick-shelled, green eggs. The shell is around thick, but rather thinner in northern regions according to indigenous Australians. The eggs are on average and weigh between . The maternal investment in the egg is considerable, and the proportion of yolk to albumen, at about 50%, is greater than would be predicted for a precocial egg of this size. This probably relates to the long incubation period which means the developing chick must consume greater resources before hatching. The first verified occurrence of genetically identical avian twins was demonstrated in the emu. The egg surface is granulated and pale green. During the incubation period, the egg turns dark green, although if the egg never hatches, it will turn white from the bleaching effect of the sun.Eastman, p. 25. Emu chicks have longitudinal stripes that provide camouflage The male becomes broody after his mate starts laying, and may begin to incubate the eggs before the clutch is complete. From this time on, he does not eat, drink, or defecate, and stands only to turn the eggs, which he does about ten times a day. He develops a brood patch, a bare area of wrinkled skin which is in intimate contact with the eggs. Over the course of the eight-week incubation period, he will lose a third of his weight and will survive on stored body fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest. As with many other Australian birds, such as the superb fairywren, infidelity is the norm for emus, despite the initial pair bond: once the male starts brooding, the female usually wanders off, and may mate with other males and lay in multiple nests; thus, as many as half the chicks in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male, or even by either parent, as emus also exhibit brood parasitism. Male with older juveniles Some females stay and defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area completely to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie down on top of the nest and try to blend in with the similar- looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.Eastman, p. 26. Incubation takes 56 days, and the male stops incubating the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks need to develop a capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will need to be able to cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch. Newly hatched chicks are active and can leave the nest within a few days of hatching. They stand about tall at first, weigh , and have distinctive brown and cream stripes for camouflage, which fade after three months or so. The male guards the growing chicks for up to seven months, teaching them how to find food. Chicks grow very quickly and are fully grown in five to six months; they may remain with their family group for another six months or so before they split up to breed in their second season. During their early life, the young emus are defended by their father, who adopts a belligerent stance towards other emus, including the mother. He does this by ruffling his feathers, emitting sharp grunts, and kicking his legs to drive off other animals. He can also bend his knees to crouch over smaller chicks to protect them. At night, he envelops his young with his feathers.Eastman, p. 27. As the young emus cannot travel far, the parents must choose an area with plentiful food in which to breed. In captivity, emus can live for upwards of ten years. = Predation = Emu and chicks, from The Birds of Australia, John Gould, 1848 There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it may have faced numerous terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals thousands of years ago from a stock of semi- domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the dingo on its way down. The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.Eastman, p. 29. Despite the potential prey-predator relationship, the presence of predaceous dingoes does not appear to heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully- grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful. The birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try to evade its attacker.Wedge-tailed eagle (Australian Natural History Series) by Peggy Olsen. CSIRO Publishing (2005), Other raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks. =Parasites= Emus can suffer from both external and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu as well as a wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.  Relationship with humans  Aboriginal emu caller, used to arouse the curiosity of emus Emus were used as a source of food by indigenous Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.Eastman, p. 63. The early European settlers killed emus to provide food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They also tried to prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus. = Economic value = In the areas in which it was endemic, the emu was an important source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the fat as bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin. It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.Eastman, pp. 62‚Äì64. Their eggs were also foraged for food.Clarke, P. A. (2018). Aboriginal foraging practices and crafts involving birds in the post-European period of the Lower Murray, South Australia. Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia, 142(1), 1-26. An example of how the emu was cooked comes from the Arrernte of Central Australia who called it Kere ankerre: Farmed emu being grain fed The birds were a food and fuel source for early European settlers, and are now farmed, in Australia and elsewhere, for their meat, oil and leather. Commercial emu farming started in Western Australia around 1970. The commercial industry in the country is based on stock bred in captivity, and all states except Tasmania have licensing requirements to protect wild emus. Outside Australia, emus are farmed on a large scale in North America, with about 1 million birds in the US, Peru, and China, and to a lesser extent in some other countries. Emus breed well in captivity, and are kept in large open pens to avoid the leg and digestive problems that arise from inactivity. They are typically fed on grain supplemented by grazing, and are slaughtered at 15 to 18 months. The Salem district administration in India advised farmers in 2012 not to invest in the emu business which was being heavily promoted at the time; further investigation was needed to assess the profitability of farming the birds in India. In the United States, it was reported in 2013 that many ranchers had left the emu business; it was estimated that the number of growers had dropped from over five thousand in 1998 to one or two thousand in 2013. The remaining growers increasingly rely on sales of oil for their profit, although, leather, eggs, and meat are also sold. 1807 plate showing now extinct island emus taken to France for breeding purposes in 1804 Emus are farmed primarily for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and is comparable to other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it is considered to be poultry. Emu fat is rendered to produce oil for cosmetics, dietary supplements, and therapeutic products. The oil is obtained from the subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat; the macerated adipose tissue is heated and the liquefied fat is filtered to get a clear oil. This consists mainly of fatty acids of which oleic acid (42%), linoleic and palmitic acids (21% each) are the most prominent components. It also contains various anti-oxidants, notably carotenoids and flavones. There is some evidence that the oil has anti-inflammatory properties; however, there have not yet been extensive tests, and the USDA regards pure emu oil as an unapproved drug and highlighted it in a 2009 article entitled \\"How to Spot Health Fraud\\". Nevertheless, the oil has been linked to the easing of gastrointestinal inflammation, and tests on rats have shown that it has a significant effect in treating arthritis and joint pain, more so than olive or fish oils. It has been scientifically shown to improve the rate of wound healing, but the mechanism responsible for this effect is not understood. A 2008 study has claimed that emu oil has a better anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potential than ostrich oil, and linked this to emu oil's higher proportion of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. While there are no scientific studies showing that emu oil is effective in humans, it is marketed and promoted as a dietary supplement with a wide variety of claimed health benefits. Commercially marketed emu oil supplements are poorly standardised. Emu leather has a distinctive patterned surface, due to a raised area around the feather follicles in the skin; the leather is used in such items as wallets, handbags, shoes and clothes, often in combination with other leathers. The feathers and eggs are used in decorative arts and crafts. In particular, emptied emu eggs have been engraved with portraits, similar to cameos, and scenes of Australian native animals. Mounted Emu eggs and emu-egg containers in the form of hundreds of goblets, inkstands and vases were produced in the second half of the nineteenth century, all richly embellished with images of Australian flora, fauna and indigenous people by travelling silversmiths, founders of a 'new Australian grammar of ornament'.Jonathan Sweet, 'Belonging before Federation: Design and Identity in Colonial Australian Gold and Silver', in Brian Hubber (ed.), All that Glitters: Australian Colonial Gold and Silver from the Vizard Foundation, exhibition catalogue, Geelong Regional Art Gallery, Geelong, 2001, p. 15.John B Hawkins, 19th Century Australian Silver, Antique Collectors' Club, Woodbridge, UK, 1990, vol. 1, p. 22‚Äì6; Eva Czernis-Ryl (ed.), Australian Gold & Silver, 1851‚Äì1900, exhibition catalogue, Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, 1995.

Patterns of Domestication. = Cultural references = The emu has a prominent place in Australian Aboriginal mythology, including a creation myth of the Yuwaalaraay and other groups in New South Wales who say that the sun was made by throwing an emu's egg into the sky; the bird features in numerous aetiological stories told across a number of Aboriginal groups. One story from Western Australia holds that a man once annoyed a small bird, who responded by throwing a boomerang, severing the arms of the man and transforming him into a flightless emu.Eastman, p. 60. The Kurdaitcha man of Central Australia is said to wear sandals made of emu feathers to mask his footprints.

Several of the Sydney rock engravings depict emus, and the birds are mimicked in indigenous dances.Eastman, p. 62. The emu is popularly but unofficially considered as a faunal emblem ‚Äì the national bird of Australia. It appears as a shield bearer on the Coat of arms of Australia with the red kangaroo, and as a part of the Arms also appears on the Australian 50-cent coin. It has featured on numerous Australian postage stamps, including a pre-federation New South Wales 100th Anniversary issue from 1888, which featured a 2 pence blue emu stamp, a 36-cent stamp released in 1986, and a $1.35 stamp released in 1994. The hats of the Australian Light Horse are decorated with emu feather plumes.Marti, S. (2018). \\"The Symbol of Our Nation\\": The Slouch Hat, the First World War, and Australian Identity. Journal of Australian Studies, 42(1), 3-18. Trademarks of early Australian companies using the emu included Webbenderfer Bros frame mouldings (1891), Mac Robertson Chocolate and Cocoa (1893), Dyason and Son Emu Brand Cordial Sauce (1894), James Allard Pottery Wares (1906), and rope manufacturers G. Kinnear and Sons Pty. Ltd. still use it on some of their products. There are around six hundred gazetted places in Australia with \\"emu\\" in their title, including mountains, lakes, hills, plains, creeks and waterholes. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many Australian companies and household products were named after the bird. In Western Australia, Emu beer has been produced since the early 20th century and the Swan Brewery continues to produce a range of beers branded as \\"Emu\\". The quarterly peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, also known as Birds Australia, is entitled Emu: Austral Ornithology. The comedian Rod Hull featured a wayward emu puppet in his act for many years and the bird returned to the small screen in the hands of his son after the puppeteer's death in 1999. In 2019, American insurance company Liberty Mutual launched an advertising campaign that features LiMu Emu, a CGI-rendered emu. File:Emu public.jpgThe Aboriginal \\"Emu in the sky\\".

File:Australian Coat of Arms.pngCoat of Arms of Australia File:Australianstamp 1505.jpgThe emu on a postage stamp of Australia issued in 1942  Status and conservation  John Gerrard Keulemans's (c. 1910) restoration of the Tasmanian emu, one of three subspecies which were hunted out of existence In John Gould's Handbook to the Birds of Australia, first published in 1865, he lamented the loss of the emu from Tasmania, where it had become rare and has since become extinct; he noted that emus were no longer common in the vicinity of Sydney and proposed that the species be given protected status. In the 1930s, emu killings in Western Australia peaked at 57,000, and culls were also mounted in Queensland during this period due to rampant crop damage. In the 1960s, bounties were still being paid in Western Australia for killing emus, but since then, wild emus have been granted formal protection under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Their occurrence range is between , and a 1992 census suggested that their total population was between 630,000 and 725,000. Their population trend is thought to be stable and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature assesses their conservation status as being of least concern. The isolated emu population of the New South Wales North Coast Bioregion and Port Stephens is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Government. Although the population of emus on mainland Australia is thought to be higher now than it was before European settlement, some local populations are at risk of extinction. The threats faced by emus include the clearance and fragmentation of areas of suitable habitat, deliberate slaughter, collisions with vehicles and predation of the eggs and young.

It is named after the Danish island of Bornholm where an outbreak was one of the first to be described. Signs and symptoms Symptoms may include fever and headache, but the distinguishing characteristic of this disease is attacks of severe pain in the lower chest, often on one side. The slightest movement of the rib cage causes a sharp increase of pain, which makes it very difficult to breathe, and an attack is therefore quite a frightening experience, although it generally passes off before any actual harm occurs. The attacks are unpredictable and strike \\"out of the blue\\" with a feeling like an iron grip around the rib cage. The colloquial names for the disease, such as 'The Devil's grip' (see also \\"other names\\" below) reflect this symptom. Cause Inoculation of throat washings taken from people with this disease into the brains of newborn mice revealed that enteroviruses in the Coxsackie B virus group were likely to be the cause of pleurodynia, and those findings were supported by subsequent studies of IgM antibody responses measured in serum from people with pleurodynia. Other viruses in the enterovirus family, including echovirus and Coxsackie A virus, are infrequently associated with pleurodynia. Spread As is typical with this virus family, it is shed in large amounts in the feces of infected persons. The disease can be spread by sharing drink containers, and has been contracted by laboratory personnel working with the virus. Treatment and prognosis The illness lasts about a week and is rarely fatal. Treatment includes the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or the application of heat to the affected muscles. Relapses during the weeks following the initial episode are a characteristic feature of this disease. Epidemiology Coxsackie B virus is spread by contact and epidemics usually occur during warm weather in temperate regions and at any time in the tropics. History In 1872, Daae-Finsen reported an epidemic of \\"acute muscular rheumatism\\" occurring in the community Bamble, Norway, giving rise to the name \\"Bamble disease\\". Subsequent reports, published only in Norwegian, referred to the disease by this name. In 1933, Ejnar Sylvest gave a doctoral thesis describing a Danish outbreak of this disease on Bornholm Island entitled, \\"Bornholm disease-myalgia epidemica\\", and this name has persisted. Other names It is also known as Bamble disease, the devil's grip, devil's grippe, epidemic myalgia, epidemic pleurodynia, epidemic transient diaphragmatic spasm or The Grasp of the Phantom.

Etymology The word nicotiana (as well as nicotine) was named in honor of Jean Nicot, French ambassador to Portugal, who in 1559 sent it as a medicine to the court of Catherine de' Medici.  Ecology  Female Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) Despite containing enough nicotine and/or other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores, a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on Nicotiana species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species and therefore some tobacco plants (chiefly tree tobacco, N. glauca) have become established as invasive species in some places. In the 19th century, young tobacco plantings came under increasing attack from flea beetles (Epitrix cucumeris and/or Epitrix pubescens), causing destruction of half the United States tobacco crop in 1876. In the years afterward, many experiments were attempted and discussed to control the flea beetle. By 1880, it was discovered that covering young plants with a frame covered with thin fabric (instead of with branches, as had previously been used for frost control) would effectively protect plants from the beetle. This practice spread until it became ubiquitous in the 1890s. Lepidoptera whose caterpillars feed on Nicotiana include: * Dark sword-grass or black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon * Turnip moth, Agrotis segetum * Mouse moth, Amphipyra tragopoginis * The nutmeg, Discestra trifolii * Endoclita excrescens * Blackburn's sphinx moth, Manduca blackburni * Tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta * Tomato hornworm, Manduca quinquemaculata * Cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae * Angle shades, Phlogophora meticulosa * Setaceous Hebrew character, Xestia c-nigrum * Cabbage looper, Trichoplusia niUnited States.

Cultivation  Nicotiana sylvestris Nicotiana alata Nicotiana langsdorffii Nicotiana obtusifolia Nicotiana √ó sanderae ornamental cultivar Several species of Nicotiana, such as N. sylvestris, N. alata 'Lime Green' and N. langsdorffii are grown as ornamental plants, often under the name of flowering tobacco. They are popular vespertines (evening bloomers), their sweet-smelling flowers opening in the evening to be visited by hawkmoths and other pollinators. In temperate climates they behave as annuals (hardiness 9a-11). The hybrid cultivars Domino Series and 'Lime Green' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Garden varieties are derived from N. alata (e.g. 'Niki' and 'Saratoga' series) and more recently from Nicotiana x sanderae (e.g. 'Perfume' and 'Domino' series). The tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) has proven to be a massive pest of many species in the genus, and has resisted many attempts at management.  References   Bibliography  * (1999): Nicotiana.

Life  Winsl√∏w was born in Odense, Denmark. Later he became a pupil and successor of Guichard Joseph Duverney, as well as a convert to Catholicism, naturalized in France, and finally became professor of anatomy at the Jardin du Roi in Paris. He greatly admired Bishop Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet, the famous preacher who had been instrumental in his conversion, and changed his first name to that of Bossuet. Winsl√∏w died in Paris.  Work  His main work, with many translations, was Exposition anatomique de la structure du corps humain, published in 1732. His exposition of the structure of the human body is distinguished for being not only the first treatise of descriptive anatomy, divested of physiological details and hypothetical explanations foreign to the subject, but for being a close description derived from actual objects, without reference to the writings of previous anatomists. About the same time William Cheselden in London, the first Alexander Monro in Edinburgh, and Bernhard Siegfried Albinus in Leiden, contributed by their several treatises to render anatomy still more precise as a descriptive science. The Osteographia of the first-mentioned was of much use in directing attention to the study of the skeleton and the morbid changes to which it is liable. He addressed the question of the sure signs of death. The omental foramen, which he first described, is still known under the alternative name of \\"Winslow's foramen\\".

Studies from the Department of Musicology, G√∂teborg University, no. 70, 2002, , ISSN 1650-9285. The words \\"wohl\\" and \\"temperieren\\" became combined as \\"Wohltemperiert\\". The \\"Orgelprobe\\" 1681, and other Werckmeister publications were the source of inspiration for Prof. H. Kelletat, for the elaboration of the \\"Wohltemperiert\\" definition given below, and published in \\"Zur Musikalischen Temperatur\\", page 9 (): In most tuning systems used before 1700, one or more intervals on the twelve-note keyboard were so far from any pure interval that they were unusable in harmony and were called a \\"wolf interval\\". Until about 1650 the most common keyboard temperament was quarter-comma meantone, in which the fifths were narrowed to the extent that they were just usable, and would thereby produce justly tuned thirds. The syntonic comma was distributed between four intervals, with most of the comma accommodated in the sol to mi diminished sixth, which expands to nearly a minor sixth. It is this interval that is usually called the \\"wolf\\", because it is so far out of consonance. The term \\"mean tone\\", the basis for meantone temperament, refers to the mathematical averaging of thirds, in which the middle note (for example the D between C and E) is in the \\"mean\\" position between the notes making the third. Another example of this is equal temperament (which is actually eleventh-comma meantone (syntonic comma) or twelfth-comma meantone (pythagorean comma) if seen in the perspective as to how to divide the comma between the fifths). The wolf was not a problem if music was played in a small number of keys (or to be more precise, transposed modes) with few accidentals, but it prevented players from transposing and modulating freely. Some instrument-makers sought to remedy the problem by introducing more than twelve notes per octave, producing enharmonic keyboards which could provide, for example, a D and an E with different pitches so that the thirds B‚ÄìD and E‚ÄìG could both be euphonious. However, Werckmeister realised that these \\"subsemitonia\\", as he called them, were unnecessary, and even counterproductive in music with chromatic progressions and extensive modulations. He described a series of tunings where enharmonic notes had the same pitch: in other words, the same note was used as both (say) E and D, thereby \\"bringing the keyboard into the form of a circle\\". This refers to the fact that the notes or keys may be arranged in a circle of fifths and it is possible to modulate from one key to another unrestrictedly. Kenneth attributes the invention of equal temperament to Zhu Zaiyu and provides textual quotations as evidence . Fritz A. Kuttner is critical of this theory and proposes that neither Zhu Zaiyu nor Simon Stevin () achieved equal temperament, and that neither of the two should be treated as inventors . Forms The term \\"well temperament\\" or \\"good temperament\\" (; ) usually means some sort of irregular temperament in which the tempered fifths are of different sizes but no key has very impure intervals. Historical irregular temperaments usually have the narrowest fifths between the diatonic notes (\\"naturals\\") producing purer thirds, and wider fifths among the chromatic notes (\\"sharps and flats\\"). Each key then has a slightly different intonation, hence different keys have distinct characters. Such \\"key-color\\" was an essential part of much 18th- and 19th-century music and was described in treatises of the period. The first circular temperament was described by the organist Arnolt Schlick in the early 16th century, but \\"well temperaments\\" did not become widely used until the baroque period. They persisted through the classical period, and even survived into the late 19th century in some areas, for example in Italy. There are many well temperament schemes, some nearer meantone temperament, others nearer equal temperament. Although such tunings have no wolf fifth, keys with many sharps or flats still do not sound very well in tune (due to their thirds). This can contrast chords in which vibrations are concordant with others where the vibrations are not harmonically related. Some theorists have sought to define \\"well temperament\\" more narrowly to exclude fifths wider than pure, which rules out many such schemes. Some well-known well temperaments go by the following names: * Werckmeister temperament (invented by Andreas Werckmeister) * French Temperament Ordinaire * Neidhardt * Kirnberger * Kellner * Vallotti (invented by Francesco Antonio Vallotti) * Young Some temperament schemes feature numbers of perfect, pure fifths and these give enhanced harmonic resonance to instruments and music on which they are played so that music moves into and out of focus between keys as vibrations lock together or not. Werckmeister features 8 perfect fifths, Kellner 7 and Vallotti 6. Alternatively, \\"Reverse Lehman-Bach 14,\\" a system by Kees Van Den Doel, features only 3 pure perfect fifths in exchange for optimal major thirds, with none wider than a Pythagorean Third.http://persianney.com/misc/wtemp.pdf The contemporary composer Douglas Leedy has written several works for harpsichord or organ in which the use of a well temperament is required.

Synonyms are isocyanatomethane, methyl carbylamine and MIC. Methyl isocyanate is an intermediate chemical in the production of carbamate pesticides (such as carbaryl, carbofuran, methomyl, and aldicarb). It has also been used in the production of rubbers and adhesives. As a highly toxic and irritating material, it is extremely hazardous to human health. It was the principal toxicant involved in the Bhopal disaster, which killed 2,259 people initially and officially 3,787 people in total.Methyl Isocyanate. Union Carbide F-41443A ‚Äì 7/76. Union Carbide Corporation, New York 1976Operating Manual Part II. Methyl Isocyanate Unit. Union Carbide India Limited, Agricultural Products Division, 1979  Physical properties  Methyl isocyanate is a colorless, poisonous, lachrymatory (tearing agent), flammable liquid.Union Carbide Corporation \\"Methyl Isocyanate\\" Product Information Publication, F-41443, November 1967. It is soluble in water to 6‚Äì10 parts per 100 parts, but it also reacts with water (see Reactions below).  Manufacture  Methyl isocyanate is usually manufactured by the reaction of monomethylamine and phosgene. For large scale production, it is advantageous to combine these reactants at higher temperature in the gas phase. A mixture of methyl isocyanate and two moles of hydrogen chloride is formed, but N-methylcarbamoyl chloride (MCC) forms as the mixture is condensed, leaving one mole of hydrogen chloride as a gas. none The methyl isocyanate is obtained by treating the MCC with a tertiary amine, such as N,N-dimethylaniline, or with pyridine or by separating it by using distillation techniques. none Methyl isocyanate is also manufactured from N-methylformamide and air. In the latter process, it is immediately consumed in a closed-loop process to make methomyl.Chemical Week, \\"A fleeting existence for toxic-gas molecules\\" p. 9, June 12, 1985. Other manufacturing methods have been reported.  Reactions  Methyl isocyanate reacts readily with many substances that contain N-H or O-H groups. With water, it forms 1,3-dimethylurea and carbon dioxide with the evolution of heat (325 calories per gram of MIC): none At 25 ¬∞C, in excess water, half of the MIC is consumed in 9 min.; if the heat is not efficiently removed from the mixture, the rate of the reaction will increase and rapidly cause the MIC to boil. If MIC is in excess, 1,3,5-trimethylbiuret is formed along with carbon dioxide. Alcohols and phenols, which contain an O-H group, react slowly with MIC, but the reaction can be catalyzed by trialkylamines or dialkyltin dicarboxylate. Oximes, hydroxylamines, and enols also react with MIC to form methylcarbamates. These reactions produce the products described below (Uses). none Ammonia, primary, and secondary amines rapidly react with MIC to form substituted ureas. Other N-H compounds, such as amides and ureas, react much more slowly with MIC. It also reacts with itself to form a trimer or higher molecular weight polymers. In the presence of catalysts, MIC reacts with itself to form a solid trimer, trimethyl isocyanurate, or a higher molecular weight polymer: none Sodium methoxide, triethyl phosphine, ferric chloride and certain other metal compounds catalyze the formation of the MIC- trimer, while the high-molecular-weight polymer formation is catalyzed by certain trialkylamines. Since the formation of the MIC trimer is exothermic (298 calories per gram of MIC), the reaction can lead to violent boiling of the MIC. The high-molecular-weight polymer hydrolyzes in hot water to form the trimethyl isocyanurate. Since catalytic metal salts can be formed from impurities in commercial grade MIC and steel, this product must not be stored in steel drums or tanks.  Hazards  Methyl isocyanate is extremely toxic. The threshold limit value set by the American Conference on Government Industrial Hygienists is 0.02 ppm. MIC is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and contact in quantities as low as 0.4 ppm. Exposure symptoms include coughing, chest pain, dyspnea, asthma, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, as well as skin damage. Higher levels of exposure, over 21 ppm, can result in pulmonary or lung edema, emphysema and hemorrhages, bronchial pneumonia and death. Although the odor of methyl isocyanate cannot be detected at 5 ppm by most people, its potent lachrymal properties provide an excellent warning of its presence (at a concentration of 2‚Äì4 parts per million (ppm) subject's eyes are irritated, while at 21 ppm, subjects could not tolerate the presence of methyl isocyanate in air). Proper care must be taken to store methyl isocyanate because of its ease of exothermically polymerizing (see Reactions) and its similar sensitivity to water. Only stainless steel or glass containers may be safely used; the MIC must be stored at temperatures below and preferably at . The toxic effect of the compound was apparent in the 1984 Bhopal disaster, when around of methyl isocyanate and other gases were released from the underground reservoirs of the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) factory, over a populated area on December 3, 1984, killing about 3,500 people immediately and 15,000 more over the next several years.  Mechanism of action  Until recent decades, the mechanism of methyl isocyanate toxicity in humans was largely unknown or unclear. Methyl isocyanate and other isocyanates are electrophiles and are currently thought to cause toxicity by the alkylation of biomolecules. The mechanism of methyl isocyanate was previously suspected to be the carbamylation of hemoglobin which would interfere with its oxygen binding capability causing hypoxia. However, experiments showed that when rats and guinea pigs were exposed to methyl isocyanate at concentrations above the LC50, only 2% of hemoglobin molecules were carbamylated suggesting that this is likely not the mechanism of toxicity.  Extraterrestrial occurrence  ALMA. On 30 July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the Philae lander on comet 67/P surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde.

It is located about east of Brussels. The municipality itself comprises the historic city and the former neighbouring municipalities of Heverlee, Kessel-Lo, a part of Korbeek-Lo, Wilsele and Wijgmaal. It is the eighth largest city in Belgium with more than 100,244 inhabitants.Federal Ministry of Home Affairs, 1 November 2016 KU Leuven, Belgium's largest university, has its flagship campus in Leuven, which has been a university city since 1425. This makes it the oldest university city in the Low Countries. The city is home of the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest beer brewerhttps://blog.technavio.com/blog/top-companies-global-beer-market and sixth-largest fast-moving consumer goods company.https://www.mbaskool.com/fun- corner/top-brand-lists/17609-top-10-fmcg-companies-in-the-world.html History Leuven on the Ferraris map (around 1775) =Middle ages= The earliest mention of Leuven (Loven) dates from 891, when a Viking army was defeated by the Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia (see: Battle of Leuven). According to a legend, the city's red and white arms depict the blood-stained shores of the river Dyle after this battle, similarly to the flag of Austria. Situated beside this river, and near to the stronghold of the Dukes of Brabant, Leuven became the most important centre of trade in the duchy between the 11th and 14th centuries. A token of its former importance as a centre of cloth manufacture is shown in that ordinary linen cloth was known, in late-14th-century and 15th-century texts, as lewyn (other spellings: Leuwyn, Levyne, Lewan(e), Lovanium, Louvain). =Early modern period= In the 15th century, a new golden era began with the founding of the predecessor of what is now the largest and oldest university in the Low Countries, the University of Leuven, in 1425. Prestigious buildings like the Town Hall and the Saint Peter's Church were constructed. The art of painting flourished with painters such as Dirk Bouts, Albrecht Bouts and Jan Rombouts the Elder. The painter Quinten Metsys was born and trained in Leuven. By the turn of the 16th century Leuven had become a major European center for art and knowledge with humanists like Erasmus and Hieronymus van Busleyden working there. In 1517 the latter founded the Collegium Trilingue in which the three ancient languages: Latin, Greek and Hebrew were taught. It promoted the critical study of classical literature and the Bible. Thomas More published his Utopia at Dirk Martens printing house in Leuven in 1516. Gemma Frisius laid the foundation for modern triangulation methods and cartography. He further made important contributions to mathematics, geography and astronomy. Gerardus Mercator and John Dee were among his students. Leuven became a leading centre for the fabrication of precision astronomical instruments, such as the planetaria and the terrestrial and celestial globes built by Gaspard van der Heyden and Gualterus Arsenius. Andreas Vesalius completed his medicine studies in Leuven, before moving to Padova and Basel. Religious persecutions of protestants, followed by greater religious en political turmoil starting in the late 1560's, greatly affected intellectual life in Leuven. Many professors and alumni from Leuven moved abroad. The newly founded University of Leiden in Holland, amongst others, would profit greatly from this brain drain. Despite this the University continued to excel in disciplines like theology with Johannes Molanus and classical studies with Justus Lipsius. =18th and 19th centuries = In the 18th century, the brewery Den Horn (meaning \\"the horn\\") flourished. In 1708, Sebastien Artois became the master brewer at Den Horn, and gave his name to the brewery in 1717, now part of AB InBev, whose flagship beer, Stella Artois, is brewed in Leuven and sold in many countries. View over Leuven, late 19th century =20th century= Leuven has several times been besieged or occupied by foreign armies; these include the Battle of Leuven (891), Siege of Leuven (1635) and Battle of Leuven (1831). In the 20th century, both world wars inflicted major damage upon the city. Upon Germany's entry into World War I, the town was heavily damaged by rampaging soldiers.Michael S. Neiberg, Fighting the Great War: A Global History, Harvard University Press, 2005. p. 15. In all, about 300 civilians lost their lives. The university library was destroyed on 25 August 1914, using petrol and incendiary pastilles. 230,000 volumes were lost in the destruction, including Gothic and Renaissance manuscripts, a collection of 750 medieval manuscripts, and more than 1,000 incunabula (books printed before 1501).Knuth 2006, p. 164. The destruction of the library shocked the world, with the Daily Chronicle describing it as war not only against civilians but also against \\"posterity to the utmost generation.\\"Tuchman 1962, p. 321. It was rebuilt after the war, and much of the collection was replaced. Great Britain (on the initiative of the John Rylands Library in Manchester) and the United States were major providers of material for the replenishment of the collection. The new library building was financed by the National Committee of the United States for the Restoration of the University of Louvain and built to the design of architect Whitney Warren; it was officially opened on 4 July 1928.The burning of the library of Leuven and the international response , Mark Derez, 2012, University Archives KU Leuven (pp. 9‚Äì12) Richard Harding Davis, a war correspondent for the New York Tribune, was in Leuven and wrote a column titled \\"The Germans Were Like Men After an Orgy\\" in which he described the organized civilian murders and vandalism committed by the occupying troops.Destruction of the university library, 1914 In World War II, after the start of the German offensive, Leuven formed part of the British Expeditionary Force's front line and was defended by units of the 3rd Division and Belgian troops. From 14 to 16 May 1940, the German Army Group B assaulted the city with heavy air and artillery support. The British withdrew their forces to the River Senne on the night of 16 May and the town was occupied the next day.*Ellis, L. F. (1954) The War in France and Flanders 1939‚Äì1940. J. R. M. Butler (ed.). HMSO. London (p. 62) The new university library building was set on fire by shelling, on 16 May, and nearly a million books were lost.Derez p. 13 Climate Economy Given the presence of the KU Leuven, Europe's most innovative university according to Reuters, much of the local economy is concentrated on spin-offs from academic research. In addition, the Leuven-based research centre, IMEC, is a world class research centre in the field of nano-electronics and digital technologies.IMEC As a result, dozens of companies in high technological fields such as biotech, robotics, additive manufacturing and IT, are located near these research institutes on the Arenberg Science Park and Haasrode Research-Park. Quite a few international companies such as Siemens, Huawei, Nitto Denko, JSR Corporation or Commscope have important, often research oriented branches, in Leuven. The academic hospital UZ Leuven, first in Europe regarding the number of clinical tests per capita and approval rates for clinical trials , UZ Leuven is another advanced research institute. It is one of Europe's largest and most advanced academic hospitals. As a result, large numbers of private service providers are active in the medical, financial and legal fields. Because it is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant, many governmental institutions are located in Leuven, as well as the regional headquarters of transport corporations such as De Lijn. As one of Flanders Art-Cities, with a large range of caf√©s, restaurants, cultural institutions and shopping neighbourhoods, Leuven also attracts a growing number of tourists. Leuven is the worldwide headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the largest beer company in the world and is considered one of the largest fast- moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. InBev's Stella Artois brewery and main offices dominate the entire north-eastern part of the town, between the railway station and the canal to Mechelen. Finally, Leuven is the ancestral home of the KBC bank. KBC is one of the leading financial groups in Europe. It is a multi-channel bank-insurance group, with a geographic focus on Belgium, Ireland & Central Europe, catering mainly to retail clients, SMEs and local midcaps. As one of the largest companies in Belgium and it has its insurance and autolease HQ in Leuven. Demographics , the population of Leuven was 100,244. The arrondissement of Leuven counted 494,189 in 2014. The city itself is made up out of the centre of Leuven (30,313), Kessel-Lo (29,147), Heverlee (22,521), Wilsele (9,786) and Wijgmaal (3,592). =Student population= Leuven has a large Dutch-speaking student population, mainly concentrated around the city centre. The Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven; University of Leuven) has two campuses in the city, with a total of more than 45,000 students as of January 2020. It is the oldest Catholic university still in existence in the world, and the largest university in Belgium. There are also a number of hogescholen (universities of applied sciences), such as the UC Leuven-Limburg (UCLL). Transport Within the city and its immediate surroundings, most distances can be covered on foot or with a bicycle. Several streets are off-limits to vehicle traffic and, within the city centre, road speed regulations prescribe as the maximum speed limit, making it a pedestrian and bicycle-friendly city. There are also a few car parking lots. There are numerous buses, primarily from the public transport company De Lijn, that connect the city with the region while providing travel options within the city centre. The so-called Ringbus follows the ring road of the city. Except for long distance routes (such as to other cities) and other irregular bus services, most buses come by every 10 minutes. Buses 616, 652 and 651 connect Leuven with Brussels Airport. Leuven railway station is located on the NMBS railway lines 35 (Leuven‚ÄìAarschot‚ÄìHasselt), 36 (Brussels‚ÄìLi√®ge), 36N (Schaarbeek‚ÄìLeuven), 53 (Schellebelle‚ÄìLeuven), and 139 (Leuven‚ÄìOttignies). In Bierbeek, south-east of Leuven, lies the beginning of HSL 2, the high-speed railway towards Li√®ge. The European route E40 passes Leuven in the south, the European route E314 connects Leuven with the city of Aachen. Politics =Mayor= The governing coalition of Leuven consists of SP.A (14 out of 47 seats), Groen (10 seats) and CD&V; (8 seats), with SP.A providing the mayor with Mohamed Ridouani. The opposition is composed of N-VA (11 seats), open VLD (2 seats), PVDA (1 seat) and Vlaams Belang (1 seat). Culture One of Belgium's conservatories is based in Leuven: the Lemmens Institute, which is described as \\"Faculty of Music, Performing Arts and Education\\". It is known for its music therapy education and its wordart-drama education. Kunstencentrum STUK is a cultural centre and venue in the city center for music, theatre, sound art, and dance. Leuven holds a summer rock festival, Marktrock. Leuven has some university orchestras, such as the (USO), the (UGO). and the In September 2009, the M ‚Äì Museum Leuven opened in Leuven. It is a museum for both contemporary and historical art, located near het Ladeuzeplein. It has hosted exhibitions by international artists such as Angus Fairhurst, Sol LeWitt, Roe Ethridge and Charles Burns as well as Belgian artists such as Ilse D'Hollander, Jan Vercruysse, Antoon Van Dyck and Freek Wambacq. Leuven has a rich beer culture, being the birthplace of several beers such as Stella Artois, Leuvense Tripel, Domus and Keizersberg. It has several bars priding themselves in offering a wide variety of local and international beers, including a bar that claims to offer more than 3000 different beers. The Higher Institute of Philosophy holds the archives of the German philosopher Edmund Husserl.  Sport  The main football club of the municipality is Oud-Heverlee Leuven, successor of Stade Leuven. The city's prime basketball team are the Leuven Bears. They play their home games in the SportOase. The Cyclocross Leuven is a cyclo-cross race held in January. Buildings and landmarks =Secular= * The Town Hall, built between 1439 and 1463 by , Jan II Keldermans, and following their death, Matheus de Layens, in a Brabantian late-Gothic style. In the 19th century, 236 statues were added to the exterior, each representing a prominent local scholar, artist or noble from the city's history. The reception hall dates from 1750. * Arenberg Castle was originally built in 16th century in the Renaissance style and was extensively renovated in the Neogothic style in the 19th century. The duke of Arenberg donated the domain to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in 1916. It is open to the public. It has a beautiful green park outside with gardens. Eggs of wild ducks can be seen around the park. * The Linen-hall, in an early- Gothic style, with baroque addition, is today the University Hall. * The University Library on the Ladeuzeplein was built by the American architect Whitney Warren. It was a gift from the American people to Leuven after World War I, during which the Germans burned down the original library. The tower houses one of the largest carillons in the world. * The Oude Markt or Old Market square located in the centre of Leuven features a vibrant social scene, the centre of which displays a life-size statue of 'De Kotmadam', or \\"The Landlady\\" resting on a bench. Fonske was designed by Jef Claerhout. *Sint- Donatus Park contains remains of the medieval city wall. * Totem is a statue at the centre of the Ladeuzeplein; it is a work of the Belgian artist Jan Fabre. Featuring a 23-metre-high needle impaling a giant jewelled beetle, the statue towers over the square in front of the university library. * Fonske is a statue near the centre of town. Its full name is Fons Sapientiae, Latin for \\"fountain of wisdom\\". The statue represents a university student who, while reading a book, lets wisdom flow into his head as liquid from a glass. Just like Manneken Pis in Brussels, Fonske is, from time to time, dressed in costumes appropriate for specific occasions. =Religious= * St. Peter's Church (1425‚Äì1500) was finished by Jan Keldermans and Matheus de Layens. During the Second World War, the church was damaged. During the restoration, a Romanesque crypt from the 11th century was found. In the church itself, there are several paintings from the 15th to 18th centuries (among which, Dirk Bouts' famous painting of the last supper) and the grave of Duke Henry I of Brabant. The 50-metre-high tower ‚Äì which was meant to be 169 metres high, but was never completed ‚Äì is home to a carillon. The tower was included in UNESCO's list of Belfries of Belgium and France in 1999. * Saint-Anthony's Chapel, Pater Damiaanplein, from the 17th to the 20th centuries, contains the tomb of Father Damien, the \\"leper priest\\" of Molokai, who was canonised by Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday 11 October 2009. The Catholic Encyclopedia calls him \\"the Apostle of the Lepers\\", and elsewhere, he is known as the \\"leper priest\\". The Catholic priest's remains were returned in Belgium with great fanfare in 1936, after having been originally buried on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai where he had served the outcast lepers until his death. * The Church of Saint Michael was built in the typical Jesuit Baroque Style. * The Saint Quentin's Church incorporates remains of a Romanesque church built in the 13th century. * The Large Beguinage is one of the world's best remaining examples of its architectural type. It was recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1998. * Park Abbey, a 42ha Premonstratensian Abbey founded in 1129 and manufacturing site of the Parc Abbey Bible. It is one of the best preserved abbey complexes in the Low Countrieshttps://www.visitleuven.be/en/leuven-park- abbey and is still inhabited by a small community of Canons regular.http://norbertijnenabdijvanpark.be/wie-woont-hier/ * Keizersberg Abbey, an active Neo-Romanesque Benedictine Abbey founded in 1888.https://abdijkeizersberg.be/ It is situated on the Keizersberg (\\"Emperor's Mountain\\") which used to be the location of a 12th-century ducal castle until it was demolished in 1782. * Vlierbeek Abbey, a former Benedictine abbey founded in 1127. * Sint-Geertrui Abdij, a former Augustinian abbey founded in 1206. * Lerkeveld is a Jesuit house, student residence, and headquarters of the Society of Jesus in Belgium. * There are several other smaller churches and chapels throughout the town. =Colleges= The Old University of Leuven used to have 40 constituent colleges and 4 pedagogies, some of which are still being used by KU Leuven.

Verrazzano left a detailed account of his voyages to North America, but little is known about his personal life. After 1506, he settled in the port of Dieppe, Kingdom of France, where he began his career as a navigator. He embarked for the American coast probably in 1508 in the company of captain Thomas Aubert, on the ship La Pens√©e, equipped by the owner, Jean Ango. He explored the region of Newfoundland, possibly during a fishing trip, and possibly the St. Lawrence River in Canada; on other occasions, he made numerous voyages to the eastern Mediterranean. In September 1522, the surviving members of Ferdinand Magellan's crew returned to Spain, having circumnavigated the globe. Competition in trade was becoming urgent, especially with Portugal. King Francis I of France was impelled by French merchants and financiers from Lyon and Rouen who were seeking new trade routes and so he asked Verrazzano in 1523 to make plans to explore on France's behalf an area between Florida and Terranova, the \\"New Found Land\\", with the goal of finding a sea route to the Pacific Ocean. Within months, four ships set sail due west for the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, but a violent storm and rough seas caused the loss of two ships. The remaining two damaged ships, La Dauphine and La Normande, were forced to return to Brittany.Marcel Trudel, The Beginnings of New France 1524-1663 (Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1973), p. 4. Repairs were completed in the final weeks of 1523, and the ships set sail again. This time, the ships headed south toward calmer waters, which were under the dangerous Spanish and Portuguese control. After a stop in Madeira, complications forced La Normande back to home port, but Verrazzano's ship La Dauphine departed on January 17, 1524, piloted by Antoine de Conflans, and headed once more for the North American continent. It neared the area of Cape Fear on about March 1 and, after a short stay, reached the Pamlico Sound lagoon of modern North Carolina. In a letter to Francis I described by historians as the C√®llere Codex, Verrazzano wrote that he was convinced that the Sound was the beginning of the Pacific Ocean from which access could be gained to China. Verrazzano's voyage in 1524 Continuing to explore the coast further northwards, Verrazzano and his crew came into contact with Native Americans living on the coast. However, he did not notice the entrances to the Chesapeake Bay or the mouth of the Delaware River. In New York Bay, he encountered the Lenape and observed what he deemed to be a large lake, really the entrance to the Hudson River. He then sailed along Long Island and entered Narragansett Bay, where he received a delegation of Wampanoag and Narragansett people. The words \\"Norman villa\\" are found on the 1527 map by Visconte Maggiolo identifying the site. The historian Samuel Eliot Morison writes that \\"this occurs at Angouleme (New York) rather than Refugio (Newport). It was probably intended to compliment one of Verrazzano's noble friends. There are several places called 'Normanville' in Normandy, France. The main one is located near F√©camp and another important one near Evreux, which would naturally be it. West of it, conjecturally on the Delaware or New Jersey coast, is a Longa Villa, which Verrazzano certainly named after Fran√ßois d'Orleans, duc de Longueville.\\" He stayed there for two weeks and then moved northwards. He discovered Cape Cod Bay, his claim being proved by a map of 1529 that clearly outlined Cape Cod. He then followed the coast up to modern Maine, southeastern Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland, and he then returned to France by 8 July 1524. Verrazzano named the region that he explored Francesca in honor of the French king, but his brother's map labeled it Nova Gallia (New France). Verrazzano arranged a second voyage, with financial support from Jean Ango and Philippe de Chabot, which departed from Dieppe with four ships early in 1527. One ship was separated from the others in a gale near the Cape Verde Islands, but Verrazzano reached the coast of Brazil with two ships and harvested a cargo of brazilwood before returning to Dieppe in September. The third ship returned later, also with a cargo of brazilwood. The partial success did not find the desired passage to the Pacific Ocean, but it inspired Verrazzano's final voyage, which left Dieppe in early 1528. =Death= There are conflicting accounts of Verrazzano's demise. In one version, during his third voyage to North America in 1528, after he had explored Florida, the Bahamas, and the Lesser Antilles, Verrazzano anchored out to sea and rowed ashore, probably on the island of Guadeloupe. He was allegedly killed and eaten by the native Caribs. The fleet of two or three ships was anchored out of gunshot range, and no one could respond in time. However, older historical accounts suggest that Verrazzano was the same person as the corsair Jean Fleury, who was executed for piracy by the Spanish at Puerto del Pico, Spain. 1527 map by Visconte Maggiolo showing the east coast of North America with \\"Tera Florida\\" at top right and \\"Lavoradore\\" (Labrador) at bottom left. The information supposedly came from Giovanni da Verrazzano's voyage in 1524.(Biblioteca Ambrosiana Milan.) Reputation Despite his discoveries, Verrazzano's reputation did not proliferate as much as other explorers of that era. For example, Verrazzano gave the European name Francesca to the new land that he had seen, in accordance with contemporary practices, after the French king in whose name he sailed. That and other names that he bestowed on features that he discovered have not survived. He had the misfortune of making major discoveries in the same three years (1519 to 1521) that the dramatic Conquest of Mexico and Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigation of the world occurred. Magellan himself did not complete his voyage, but his publicist Antonio Pigafetta did so, and Spanish publicity outweighed the news of the French voyage. In the 19th and the early 20th centuries, there was a great debate in the United States about the authenticity of the letters that he wrote to Francis I to describe the geography, flora, fauna, and native population of the east coast of North America.Thrower, Norman (2003) \\"Verrazzano, Giovanni Da\\", in: Speake, Jennifer (ed.) Literature of Travel and Exploration: An Encyclopedia, Vol. 3, New York; London : Fitzroy Dearborn, Others thought that they were authentic, almost universally the current opinion,Wroth, Lawrence (1970) The Voyages of Giovanni da Verrazzano, 1524‚Äì2003', New Haven : Pierpont Morgan Library by Yale University Press, particularly after the discovery of a letter signed by Francis I, which referred to Verrazzano's letter. Verrazzano's reputation was particularly obscure in New York City, where the 1609 voyage of Henry Hudson on behalf of the Dutch Republic came to be regarded as the de facto start of European exploration of New York. It was only by a great effort in the 1950s and 1960s that Verrazzano's name and reputation were re-established as the European discoverer of the harbor, during an effort to name the newly built Narrows bridge after him. Commemorations Battery Park, Manhattan by Ettore Ximenes (1909) Verrazzano's statue in the town of Greve in Chianti, Italy *In 1909, during the Hudson-Fulton Celebration, a bronze statue of Verrazzano by Ettore Ximenes was installed in Battery Park in Manhattan. *There are numerous commemorations of the explorer on Staten Island. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, spanning The Narrows that separate Staten Island from Brooklyn, is perhaps the best known. Until October 2018, it was known as the \\"Verrazano- Narrows Bridge\\" with one \\"z\\". A Staten Island Ferry boat that served New York from the 1950s to the 1990s was also named for Verrazzano. The ferry was named the \\"Verrazzano\\", while the bridge is named \\"Verrazano\\", reflecting the confusion over the spelling of his name. A Little League team on Staten Island is also named for him. *The Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, is named for him, as is Maryland's Verrazano Bridge. *A vessel of the Italian navy, a destroyer of the Navigatori class, was named after Verrazzano.

Dialogues in > Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences, > 7(2):50-62.http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.htm Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the phenomena that appear in acts of consciousness. Phenomenology can be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis which sees the world as objects, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon one another. Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticized and developed not only by himself but also by students and colleagues such as Edith Stein, Max Scheler, Roman Ingarden, and Dietrich von Hildebrand, by existentialists such as Nicolai Hartmann, Gabriel Marcel, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre, by hermeneutic philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Paul Ricoeur, by later French philosophers such as Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida, and by sociologists such as Alfred Sch√ºtz and Eric Voegelin. Overview In its most basic form, phenomenology attempts to create conditions for the objective study of topics usually regarded as subjective: consciousness and the content of conscious experiences such as judgements, perceptions, and emotions. Although phenomenology seeks to be scientific, it does not attempt to study consciousness from the perspective of clinical psychology or neurology. Instead, it seeks through systematic reflection to determine the essential properties and structures of experience. There are several assumptions behind phenomenology that help explain its foundations: #Phenomenologists reject the concept of objective research. They prefer grouping assumptions through a process called phenomenological epoch√©. #They believe that analyzing daily human behavior can provide one with a greater understanding of nature. #They assert that persons should be explored. This is because persons can be understood through the unique ways they reflect the society they live in. #Phenomenologists prefer to gather \\"capta\\", or conscious experience, rather than traditional data. #They consider phenomenology to be oriented toward discovery, and therefore they research using methods that are far less restrictive than in other sciences.Orbe, Mark P. (2009). Phenomenology. In S. Littlejohn, & K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 750-752). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. Husserl derived many important concepts central to phenomenology from the works and lectures of his teachers, the philosophers and psychologists Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. An important element of phenomenology that Husserl borrowed from Brentano is intentionality (often described as \\"aboutness\\"), the notion that consciousness is always consciousness of something. The object of consciousness is called the intentional object, and this object is constituted for consciousness in many different ways, through, for instance, perception, memory, retention and protention, signification, etc. Throughout these different intentionalities, though they have different structures and different ways of being \\"about\\" the object, an object is still constituted as the identical object; consciousness is directed at the same intentional object in direct perception as it is in the immediately following retention of this object and the eventual remembering of it. Though many of the phenomenological methods involve various reductions, phenomenology is, in essence, anti-reductionistic; the reductions are mere tools to better understand and describe the workings of consciousness, not to reduce any phenomenon to these descriptions. In other words, when a reference is made to a thing's essence or idea, or when the constitution of an identical coherent thing is specified by describing what one \\"really\\" sees as being only these sides and aspects, these surfaces, it does not mean that the thing is only and exclusively what is described here: the ultimate goal of these reductions is to understand how these different aspects are constituted into the actual thing as experienced by the person experiencing it. Phenomenology is a direct reaction to the psychologism and physicalism of Husserl's time. Although previously employed by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in his Phenomenology of Spirit, it was Husserl's adoption of this term (c. 1900) that propelled it into becoming the designation of a philosophical school. As a philosophical perspective, phenomenology is its method, though the specific meaning of the term varies according to how it is conceived by a given philosopher. As envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's \\"lived experience.\\"Husserl, Edmund. The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970, pg. 240. Loosely rooted in an epistemological device, with Sceptic roots, called epoch√©, Husserl's method entails the suspension of judgment while relying on the intuitive grasp of knowledge, free of presuppositions and intellectualizing. Sometimes depicted as the \\"science of experience,\\" the phenomenological method is rooted in intentionality, i.e. Husserl's theory of consciousness (developed from Brentano). Intentionality represents an alternative to the representational theory of consciousness, which holds that reality cannot be grasped directly because it is available only through perceptions of reality that are representations of it in the mind. Husserl countered that consciousness is not \\"in\\" the mind; rather, consciousness is conscious of something other than itself (the intentional object), whether the object is a substance or a figment of imagination (i.e., the real processes associated with and underlying the figment). Hence the phenomenological method relies on the description of phenomena as they are given to consciousness, in their immediacy. According to Maurice Natanson (1973, p. 63), \\"The radicality of the phenomenological method is both continuous and discontinuous with philosophy's general effort to subject experience to fundamental, critical scrutiny: to take nothing for granted and to show the warranty for what we claim to know.\\" In practice, it entails an unusual combination of discipline and detachment to bracket theoretical explanations and second-hand information while determining one's \\"naive\\" experience of the matter. (To \\"bracket\\" in this sense means to provisionally suspend or set aside some idea as a way to facilitate the inquiry by focusing only on its most significant components.) The phenomenological method serves to momentarily erase the world of speculation by returning the subject to his or her primordial experience of the matter, whether the object of inquiry is a feeling, an idea, or a perception. According to Husserl the suspension of belief in what we ordinarily take for granted or infer by conjecture diminishes the power of what we customarily embrace as objective reality. According to R√ºdiger Safranski (1998, 72), \\"[Husserl's and his followers'] great ambition was to disregard anything that had until then been thought or said about consciousness or the world [while] on the lookout for a new way of letting the things [they investigated] approach them, without covering them up with what they already knew.\\" Martin Heidegger modified Husserl's conception of phenomenology because of what Heidegger perceived as Husserl's subjectivist tendencies. Whereas Husserl conceived humans as having been constituted by states of consciousness, Heidegger countered that consciousness is peripheral to the primacy of one's existence (i.e., the mode of being of Dasein), which cannot be reduced to one's consciousness of it. From this angle, one's state of mind is an \\"effect\\" rather than a determinant of existence, including those aspects of existence of which one is not conscious. By shifting the center of gravity from consciousness (psychology) to existence (ontology), Heidegger altered the subsequent direction of phenomenology. As one consequence of Heidegger's modification of Husserl's conception, phenomenology became increasingly relevant to psychoanalysis. Whereas Husserl gave priority to a depiction of consciousness that was fundamentally alien to the psychoanalytic conception of the unconscious, Heidegger offered a way to conceptualize experience that could accommodate those aspects of one's existence that lie on the periphery of sentient awareness.Natanson, M. (1973). Edmund Husserl: Philosopher of Infinite Tasks. Evanston: Northwestern University Press.Safranski, R. (1998). Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. Etymology Phenomenology has at least three main meanings in philosophical history: one in the writings of G. W. F. Hegel, another in the writings of Edmund Husserl in 1920, and thirdly, succeeding Husserl's work, in the writings of his former research assistant Martin Heidegger in 1927. *For G. W. F. Hegel, phenomenology is an approach to philosophy that begins with an exploration of phenomena (what presents itself to us in conscious experience) as a means to finally grasp the absolute, logical, ontological and metaphysical Spirit that is behind phenomena. This has been called dialectical phenomenology (see Hegelian dialectic).Roslyn Wallach Bologh, Dialectical Phenomenology: Marx's Method, Routledge, 2009, p. 16. *For Edmund Husserl, phenomenology is \\"the reflective study of the essence of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view.\\" Phenomenology takes the intuitive experience of phenomena (whatever presents itself in phenomenological reflexion) as its starting point and tries to extract from it the essential features of experiences and the essence of what we experience. When generalized to the essential features of any possible experience, this has been called transcendental phenomenology (see Varieties).Bob Sandmeyer, Husserl's Constitutive Phenomenology: Its Problem and Promise, Routledge, 2009, p. 15. Husserl's view was based on aspects of the work of Franz Brentano and was developed further by philosophers such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Max Scheler, Edith Stein, Dietrich von Hildebrand and Emmanuel Levinas. Although the term \\"phenomenology\\" was used occasionally in the history of philosophy before Husserl, modern use ties it more explicitly to his particular method. Following is a list of important thinkers, in rough chronological order, who used the term \\"phenomenology\\" in a variety of ways, with brief comments on their contributions:Partially based on * Friedrich Christoph Oetinger (1702‚Äì1782), German pietist, for the study of the \\"divine system of relations\\"Ernst Benz, Christian Kabbalah: Neglected Child of Theology * Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728‚Äì1777), mathematician, physician and philosopher, known for the theory of appearances underlying empirical knowledge.Lambert, Johann Heinrich (1772). Anmerkungen und Zus√§tze zur Entwerfung der Land- und Himmelscharten. Von J. H. Lambert (1772.) Hrsg. von A. Wangerin. Mit 21 Textfiguren. (xml). W. Engelmann, reprint 1894. * Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804), in the Critique of Pure Reason, distinguished between objects as phenomena, which are objects as shaped and grasped by human sensibility and understanding, and objects as things-in-themselves or noumena, which do not appear to us in space and time and about which we can make no legitimate judgments. * G. W. F. Hegel (1770‚Äì1831) challenged Kant's doctrine of the unknowable thing-in-itself, and declared that by knowing phenomena more fully we can gradually arrive at a consciousness of the absolute and spiritual truth of Divinity, most notably in his Phenomenology of Spirit, published in 1807. * Carl Stumpf (1848‚Äì1936), student of Brentano and mentor to Husserl, used \\"phenomenology\\" to refer to an ontology of sensory contents. * Edmund Husserl (1859‚Äì1938) established phenomenology at first as a kind of \\"descriptive psychology\\" and later as a transcendental and eidetic science of consciousness. He is considered to be the founder of contemporary phenomenology. * Max Scheler (1874‚Äì1928) developed further the phenomenological method of Edmund Husserl and extended it to include also a reduction of the scientific method. He influenced the thinking of Pope John Paul II, Dietrich von Hildebrand, and Edith Stein. * Martin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976) criticized Husserl's theory of phenomenology and attempted to develop a theory of ontology that led him to his original theory of Dasein, the non-dualistic human being. * Alfred Sch√ºtz (1899‚Äì1959) developed a phenomenology of the social world on the basis of everyday experience that has influenced major sociologists such as Harold Garfinkel, Peter Berger, and Thomas Luckmann. * Francisco Varela (1946‚Äì2001), Chilean philosopher and biologist. Developed the basis for experimental phenomenology and neurophenomenology. Later usage is mostly based on or (critically) related to Husserl's introduction and use of the term. This branch of philosophy differs from others in that it tends to be more \\"descriptive\\" than \\"prescriptive\\". Varieties The Encyclopedia of Phenomenology (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997) features separate articles on the following seven types of phenomenology:Phenomenology ‚Äì Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. # Transcendental constitutive phenomenology studies how objects are constituted in transcendental consciousness, setting aside questions of any relation to the natural world. # Naturalistic constitutive phenomenology (see naturalism) studies how consciousness constitutes things in the world of nature, assuming with the natural attitude that consciousness is part of nature. # Existential phenomenology studies concrete human existence, including our experience of free choice and/or action in concrete situations. # Generative historicist phenomenology (see historicism) studies how meaning‚Äîas found in our experience‚Äîis generated in historical processes of collective experience over time. # Genetic phenomenology studies the emergence/genesis of meanings of things within one's own stream of experience. # Hermeneutical phenomenology (also hermeneutic phenomenologyCf. interpretative phenomenological analysis in psychological qualitative research. or post- phenomenology/postphenomenologyKatinka Waelbers, Doing Good with Technologies: Taking Responsibility for the Social Role of Emerging Technologies, Springer, 2011, p. 77.Suzi Adams, \\"Towards a Post-Phenomenology of Life: Castoriadis' Naturphilosophie\\", Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy, Vol. 4, Nos. 1‚Äì2 (2008). elsewhere; see hermeneutics) studies interpretive structures of experience. This approach was introduced in Martin Heidegger's early work.Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, Phenomenology World-Wide: Foundations ‚Äî Expanding Dynamics ‚Äî Life-Engagements A Guide for Research and Study, Springer, 2014, p. 246. # Realistic phenomenology (also realist phenomenology elsewhere) studies the structure of consciousness and intentionality as \\"it occurs in a real world that is largely external to consciousness and not somehow brought into being by consciousness.\\" The contrast between \\"constitutive phenomenology\\" (; also static phenomenology (') or descriptive phenomenology (')) and \\"genetic phenomenology\\" ('; also phenomenology of genesis (')) is due to Husserl.Donn Welton, The New Husserl: A Critical Reader, Indiana University Press, 2003, p. 261. Modern scholarship also recognizes the existence of the following varieties: late Heidegger's transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology (see transcendental philosophy and a priori), Maurice Merleau-Ponty's embodied phenomenologyRasmus Thybo Jensen, Dermot Moran (eds.), The Phenomenology of Embodied Subjectivity, Springer, 2014, p. 292; Douglas Low, Merleau-Ponty in Contemporary Context, Transaction Publishers, 2013, p. 21; Jack Reynolds, Merleau-Ponty and Derrida: Intertwining Embodiment and Alterity, Ohio University Press, 2004, p. 192.

(see postanalytic philosophy). Concepts =Intentionality= Intentionality refers to the notion that consciousness is always the consciousness of something. The word itself should not be confused with the \\"ordinary\\" use of the word intentional, but should rather be taken as playing on the etymological roots of the word. Originally, intention referred to a \\"stretching out\\" (\\"in tension,\\" from Latin intendere), and in this context it refers to consciousness \\"stretching out\\" towards its object. However, one should be careful with this image: there is not some consciousness first that, subsequently, stretches out to its object; rather, consciousness occurs as the simultaneity of a conscious act and its object. Intentionality is often summed up as \\"aboutness.\\" Whether this something that consciousness is about is in direct perception or in fantasy is inconsequential to the concept of intentionality itself; whatever consciousness is directed at, that is what consciousness is conscious of. This means that the object of consciousness doesn't have to be a physical object apprehended in perception: it can just as well be a fantasy or a memory. Consequently, these \\"structures\\" of consciousness, i.e., perception, memory, fantasy, etc., are called intentionalities. The term \\"intentionality\\" originated with the Scholastics in the medieval period and was resurrected by Brentano who in turn influenced Husserl's conception of phenomenology, who refined the term and made it the cornerstone of his theory of consciousness. The meaning of the term is complex and depends entirely on how it is conceived by a given philosopher. The term should not be confused with \\"intention\\" or the psychoanalytic conception of unconscious \\"motive\\" or \\"gain\\". =Intuition= Intuition in phenomenology refers to cases where the intentional object is directly present to the intentionality at play; if the intention is \\"filled\\" by the direct apprehension of the object, you have an intuited object. Having a cup of coffee in front of you, for instance, seeing it, feeling it, or even imagining it ‚Äì these are all filled intentions, and the object is then intuited. The same goes for the apprehension of mathematical formulae or a number. If you do not have the object as referred to directly, the object is not intuited, but still intended, but then emptily. Examples of empty intentions can be signitive intentions ‚Äì intentions that only imply or refer to their objects. =Evidence= In everyday language, we use the word evidence to signify a special sort of relation between a state of affairs and a proposition: State A is evidence for the proposition \\"A is true.\\" In phenomenology, however, the concept of evidence is meant to signify the \\"subjective achievement of truth.\\"Robert Sokolowski, Introduction to Phenomenology, Cambridge University Press (2000). Pp. 159‚Äì160. This use of the word evidence may seem strange in English, but is more common in German, which is the language Husserl wrote in. This is not an attempt to reduce the objective sort of evidence to subjective \\"opinion,\\" but rather an attempt to describe the structure of having something present in intuition with the addition of having it present as intelligible: \\"Evidence is the successful presentation of an intelligible object, the successful presentation of something whose truth becomes manifest in the evidencing itself.\\"Sokolowski, Introduction, pp. 160‚Äì161. =Noesis and noema= In Husserl's phenomenology, which is quite common, this pair of terms, derived from the Greek nous (mind), designate respectively the real content, noesis, and the ideal content, noema, of an intentional act (an act of consciousness). The noesis is the part of the act that gives it a particular sense or character (as in judging or perceiving something, loving or hating it, accepting or rejecting it, and so on). This is real in the sense that it is actually part of what takes place in the consciousness (or psyche) of the subject of the act. The noesis is always correlated with a noema; for Husserl, the full noema is a complex ideal structure comprising at least a noematic sense and a noematic core. The correct interpretation of what Husserl meant by the noema has long been controversial, but the noematic sense is generally understood as the ideal meaning of the actI.e. if A loves B, loving is a real part of A's conscious activity ‚Äì noesis ‚Äì but gets its sense from the general concept of loving, which has an abstract or ideal meaning, as \\"loving\\" has a meaning in the English language independently of what an individual means by the word when they use it. and the noematic core as the act's referent or object as it is meant in the act. One element of controversy is whether this noematic object is the same as the actual object of the act (assuming it exists) or is some kind of ideal object.For a full account of the controversy and a review of positions taken, see David Woodruff Smith, Husserl, Routledge, 2007, pp. 304‚Äì311. =Empathy and intersubjectivity= In phenomenology, empathy refers to the experience of one's own body as another. While we often identify others with their physical bodies, this type of phenomenology requires that we focus on the subjectivity of the other, as well as our intersubjective engagement with them. In Husserl's original account, this was done by a sort of apperception built on the experiences of your own lived-body. The lived body is your own body as experienced by yourself, as yourself. Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of just a moment ago (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you experience being touched). The experience of your own body as your own subjectivity is then applied to the experience of another's body, which, through apperception, is constituted as another subjectivity. You can thus recognise the Other's intentions, emotions, etc. This experience of empathy is important in the phenomenological account of intersubjectivity. In phenomenology, intersubjectivity constitutes objectivity (i.e., what you experience as objective is experienced as being intersubjectively available ‚Äì available to all other subjects. This does not imply that objectivity is reduced to subjectivity nor does it imply a relativist position, cf. for instance intersubjective verifiability). In the experience of intersubjectivity, one also experiences oneself as being a subject among other subjects, and one experiences oneself as existing objectively for these Others; one experiences oneself as the noema of Others' noeses, or as a subject in another's empathic experience. As such, one experiences oneself as objectively existing subjectivity. Intersubjectivity is also a part in the constitution of one's lifeworld, especially as \\"homeworld.\\" =Lifeworld= The lifeworld (German: Lebenswelt) is the \\"world\\" each one of us lives in. One could call it the \\"background\\" or \\"horizon\\" of all experience, and it is that on which each object stands out as itself (as different) and with the meaning it can only hold for us. The lifeworld is both personal and intersubjective (it is then called a \\"homeworld\\"), and, as such, it does not enclose each one of us in a solus ipse. Husserl's Logical Investigations (1900/1901) In the first edition of the Logical Investigations, still under the influence of Brentano, Husserl describes his position as \\"descriptive psychology.\\" Husserl analyzes the intentional structures of mental acts and how they are directed at both real and ideal objects. The first volume of the Logical Investigations, the Prolegomena to Pure Logic, begins with a devastating critique of psychologism, i.e., the attempt to subsume the a priori validity of the laws of logic under psychology. Husserl establishes a separate field for research in logic, philosophy, and phenomenology, independently from the empirical sciences.On the Logical Investigations, see ; and \\"Pre-reflective self-consciousness\\" is Shaun Gallagher and Dan Zahavi's term\\"Phenomenological Approaches to Self- Consciousness\\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. for Husserl's (1900/1901) idea that self-consciousness always involves a self-appearance or self- manifestation ()Edmund Husserl (1959), Erste Philosophie II 1923‚Äì24, Husserliana VIII, Den Haag: Martinus Nijhoff, pp. 189, 412. prior to self- reflection, and his idea that the fact that \\"an appropriate train of sensations or images is experienced, and is in this sense conscious, does not and cannot mean that this is the object of an act of consciousness, in the sense that a perception, a presentation or a judgment is directed upon it\\"Edmund Husserl (1984), Logische Untersuchungen II, Husserliana XIX/1‚Äì2, Den Haag: Martinus Nijhoff, p. 165; English translation: Logical Investigations I, translated by J. N. Findlay, London: Routledge, 2001, p. 273).Shaun Gallagher, Phenomenology, Springer, 2016, p. 130. (see also Fichte's original insight). Husserl's Ideas (1913) In 1913, some years after the publication of the Logical Investigations, Husserl published Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology, a work which introduced some key elaborations that led him to the distinction between the act of consciousness (noesis) and the phenomena at which it is directed (the noemata). * \\"noetic\\" refers to the intentional act of consciousness (believing, willing, etc.) * \\"noematic\\" refers to the object or content (noema), which appears in the noetic acts (the believed, wanted, hated, and loved, etc.). What we observe is not the object as it is in itself, but how and inasmuch it is given in the intentional acts. Knowledge of essences would only be possible by \\"bracketing\\" all assumptions about the existence of an external world and the inessential (subjective) aspects of how the object is concretely given to us. This procedure Husserl called epoch√©. Husserl concentrated more on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. As he wanted to exclude any hypothesis on the existence of external objects, he introduced the method of phenomenological reduction to eliminate them. What was left over was the pure transcendental ego, as opposed to the concrete empirical ego. Transcendental phenomenology is the study of the essential structures that are left in pure consciousness: this amounts in practice to the study of the noemata and the relations among them. Transcendental phenomenologists include Oskar Becker, Aron Gurwitsch, and Alfred Sch√ºtz. The philosopher Theodor Adorno criticised Husserl's concept of phenomenological epistemology in his metacritique Against Epistemology, which is anti- foundationalist in its stance Realism After Husserl's publication of the Ideas in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories. Especially the members of the Munich group distanced themselves from his new transcendental phenomenology and preferred the earlier realist phenomenology of the first edition of the Logical Investigations. Realist phenomenologists include Adolf Reinach, Alexander Pf√§nder, , Max Scheler, Roman Ingarden, Nicolai Hartmann, and Dietrich von Hildebrand. Existentialism Existential phenomenology differs from transcendental phenomenology by its rejection of the transcendental ego. Merleau-Ponty objects to the ego's transcendence of the world, which for Husserl leaves the world spread out and completely transparent before the conscious. Heidegger thinks of a conscious being as always already in the world. Transcendence is maintained in existential phenomenology to the extent that the method of phenomenology must take a presuppositionless starting point ‚Äì transcending claims about the world arising from, for example, natural or scientific attitudes or theories of the ontological nature of the world. While Husserl thought of philosophy as a scientific discipline that had to be founded on a phenomenology understood as epistemology, Martin Heidegger held a radically different view. Heidegger himself states their differences this way: According to Heidegger, philosophy was not at all a scientific discipline, but more fundamental than science itself. According to him science is only one way of knowing the world with no special access to truth. Furthermore, the scientific mindset itself is built on a much more \\"primordial\\" foundation of practical, everyday knowledge. Husserl was skeptical of this approach, which he regarded as quasi-mystical, and it contributed to the divergence in their thinking. Instead of taking phenomenology as prima philosophia or a foundational discipline, Heidegger took it as a metaphysical ontology: \\"being is the proper and sole theme of philosophy... this means that philosophy is not a science of beings but of being.\\" Yet to confuse phenomenology and ontology is an obvious error. Phenomena are not the foundation or Ground of Being. Neither are they appearances, for, as Heidegger argues in Being and Time, an appearance is \\"that which shows itself in something else,\\" while a phenomenon is \\"that which shows itself in itself.\\" While for Husserl, in the epoch√©, being appeared only as a correlate of consciousness, for Heidegger being is the starting point. While for Husserl we would have to abstract from all concrete determinations of our empirical ego, to be able to turn to the field of pure consciousness, Heidegger claims that \\"the possibilities and destinies of philosophy are bound up with man's existence, and thus with temporality and with historicality.\\" However, ontological being and existential being are different categories, so Heidegger's conflation of these categories is, according to Husserl's view, the root of Heidegger's error. Husserl charged Heidegger with raising the question of ontology but failing to answer it, instead switching the topic to the Dasein, the only being for whom Being is an issue. That is neither ontology nor phenomenology, according to Husserl, but merely abstract anthropology. To clarify, perhaps, by abstract anthropology, as a non- existentialist searching for essences, Husserl rejected the existentialism implicit in Heidegger's distinction between beings qua existents as things in reality and their Being as it unfolds in Dasein's own reflections on its being-in-the-world, wherein being becomes present to us, that is, is unconcealed.I have attempted to respond to the request for clarification of Heidegger's distinction between being and Being. My info source was http://www.uni.edu/boedeker/NNhHeidegger2.doc. It was not copied and pasted but rephrased for copyright reasons. Existential phenomenologists include: Martin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976), Hannah Arendt (1906‚Äì1975), Karl Jaspers (1883‚Äì1969), Emmanuel Levinas (1906‚Äì1995), Gabriel Marcel (1889‚Äì1973), Jean- Paul Sartre (1905‚Äì1980), Paul Ricoeur (1913‚Äì2005) and Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908‚Äì1961). Eastern thought Some researchers in phenomenology (in particular in reference to Heidegger's legacy) see possibilities of establishing dialogues with traditions of thought outside of the so-called Western philosophy, particularly with respect to East-Asian thinking, and despite perceived differences between \\"Eastern\\" and \\"Western\\".See for instance references to Heidegger's \\"A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer,\\" in On the Way to Language (New York: Harper & Row, 1971). Heidegger himself had contacts with some leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the Kyoto School, notably Hajime Tanabe, Kuki Sh≈´z≈ç and Kiyoshi Miki. Furthermore, it has been claimed that a number of elements within phenomenology (mainly Heidegger's thought) have some resonance with Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly with Zen Buddhism and Taoism.An account given by Paul Hsao (in Heidegger and Asian Thought) records a remark by Chang Chung-Yuan claiming that \\"Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands but has intuitively grasped Taoist thought\\" According to Tomonobu Imamichi, the concept of Dasein was inspired ‚Äì although Heidegger remained silent on this ‚Äì by Okakura Kakuzo's concept of das-in-der- Welt-sein (being in the world) expressed in The Book of Tea to describe Zhuangzi's philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having studied with him the year before.Tomonobu Imamichi, In Search of Wisdom. One Philosopher's Journey, Tokyo, International House of Japan, 2004 (quoted by Anne Fagot-Largeau during her lesson at the Coll√®ge de France on 7 December 2006). There are also recent signs of the reception of phenomenology (and Heidegger's thought in particular) within scholarly circles focused on studying the impetus of metaphysics in the history of ideas in Islam and Early Islamic philosophy such as in the works of the Lebanese philosopher Nader El-Bizri;See for instance: Nader El-Bizri, The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000) ; refer also to many of his other studies and commentaries on Heidegger, including one of his latest studies: Nader El- Bizri, 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', Studia UBB. Philosophia, Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5-30 perhaps this is tangentially due to the indirect influence of the tradition of the French Orientalist and phenomenologist Henri Corbin, and later accentuated through El-Bizri's dialogues with the Polish phenomenologist Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka.A book-series under the title: Islamic Philosophy and Occidental Phenomenology in Dialogue has been recently established by Springer (Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht) in association with the World Phenomenology Institute. This initiative has been initiated by the Polish phenomenologist Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, editor of Analecta Husserliana, and is co-edited by Nader El- Bizri. In addition, the work of Jim Ruddy in the field of comparative philosophy, combined the concept of \\"transcendental ego\\" in Husserl's phenomenology with the concept of the primacy of self-consciousness in the work of Sankaracharya. In the course of this work, Ruddy uncovered a wholly new eidetic phenomenological science, which he called \\"convergent phenomenology.\\" This new phenomenology takes over where Husserl left off, and deals with the constitution of relation-like, rather than merely thing-like, or \\"intentional\\" objectivity.See the thesis, \\"Convergent Phenomenology,\\" presented to the University of Madras, June 1979. Approaches to technology James Moor has argued that computers show up policy vacuums that require new thinking and the establishment of new policies.Moor, J. H. (1985). \\"What Is Computer Ethics?\\" In T. W. Bynum (ed.), Computersand Ethics. Blackwell. Others have argued that the resources provided by classical ethical theory such as utilitarianism, consequentialism and deontological ethics is more than enough to deal with all the ethical issues emerging from our design and use of information technology.Bernard, G. (1999). Common Morality and Computing. Ethics and Information Technology 1(1). For the phenomenologist the 'impact view' of technology as well as the constructivist view of the technology/society relationships is valid but not adequate (Heidegger 1977, Borgmann 1985, Winograd and Flores 1987, Ihde 1990, Dreyfus 1992, 2001). They argue that these accounts of technology, and the technology/society relationship, posit technology and society as if speaking about the one does not immediately and already draw upon the other for its ongoing sense or meaning. For the phenomenologist, society and technology co-constitute each other; they are each other's ongoing condition, or possibility for being what they are. For them technology is not just the artifact. Rather, the artifact already emerges from a prior 'technological' attitude towards the world (Heidegger 1977). =Heidegger's= For Heidegger the essence of technology is the way of being of modern humans‚Äîa way of conducting themselves towards the world‚Äîthat sees the world as something to be ordered and shaped in line with projects, intentions and desires‚Äîa 'will to power' that manifests itself as a 'will to technology'.Introna, L. (2005) Disclosing the Digital Face: The ethics of facial recognition systems, Ethics and Information Technology, 7(2) Heidegger claims that there were other times in human history, a pre-modern time, where humans did not orient themselves towards the world in a technological way‚Äîsimply as resources for our purposes. However, according to Heidegger this 'pre-technological' age (or mood) is one where humans' relation with the world and artifacts, their way of being disposed, was poetic and aesthetic rather than technological (enframing). There are many who disagree with Heidegger's account of the modern technological attitude as the 'enframing' of the world.Feenberg, A. (1999) 'Technology and Meaning', in Questioning Technology, London and New York: Routledge. For example, Andrew Feenberg argues that Heidegger's account of modern technology is not borne out in contemporary everyday encounters with technology. Christian Fuchs has written on the anti-Semitism rooted in Heidegger's view of technology.Fuchs, Christian (2015) \\"Martin Heidegger's Anti-Semitism: Philosophy of Technology and the Media in the Light of the Black Notebooks.\\" Triple-C Vol 13, No 1. Accessed 4 May 2017. =Dreyfus'= In critiquing the artificial intelligence (AI) programme, Hubert Dreyfus (1992) argues that the way skill development has become understood in the past has been wrong. He argues, this is the model that the early artificial intelligence community uncritically adopted. In opposition to this view, he argues, with Heidegger, that what we observe when we learn a new skill in everyday practice is in fact the opposite. We most often start with explicit rules or preformulated approaches and then move to a multiplicity of particular cases, as we become an expert. His argument draws directly on Heidegger's account in \\"Being and Time\\" of humans as beings that are always already situated in-the-world. As humans 'in-the-world', we are already experts at going about everyday life, at dealing with the subtleties of every particular situation; that is why everyday life seems so obvious. Thus, the intricate expertise of everyday activity is forgotten and taken for granted by AI as an assumed starting point. What Dreyfus highlighted in his critique of AI was the fact that technology (AI algorithms) does not make sense by itself. It is the assumed, and forgotten, horizon of everyday practice that makes technological devices and solutions show up as meaningful. If we are to understand technology we need to 'return' to the horizon of meaning that made it show up as the artifacts we need, want and desire. We need to consider how these technologies reveal (or disclose) us.

The segment AB can be called the perpendicular from A to the segment CD, using \\"perpendicular\\" as a noun. The point B is called the foot of the perpendicular from A to segment CD, or simply, the foot of A on CD. In elementary geometry, the property of being perpendicular (perpendicularity) is the relationship between two lines which meet at a right angle (90 degrees). The property extends to other related geometric objects. A line is said to be perpendicular to another line if the two lines intersect at a right angle. Explicitly, a first line is perpendicular to a second line if (1) the two lines meet; and (2) at the point of intersection the straight angle on one side of the first line is cut by the second line into two congruent angles. Perpendicularity can be shown to be symmetric, meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order. Perpendicularity easily extends to segments and rays. For example, a line segment \\\\overline{AB} is perpendicular to a line segment \\\\overline{CD} if, when each is extended in both directions to form an infinite line, these two resulting lines are perpendicular in the sense above. In symbols, \\\\overline{AB} \\\\perp \\\\overline{CD} means line segment AB is perpendicular to line segment CD. For information regarding the perpendicular symbol see Up tack. A line is said to be perpendicular to a plane if it is perpendicular to every line in the plane that it intersects. This definition depends on the definition of perpendicularity between lines. Two planes in space are said to be perpendicular if the dihedral angle at which they meet is a right angle (90 degrees). Perpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of orthogonality; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word \\"perpendicular\\" is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its normal. Foot of a perpendicular The word foot is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars. This usage is exemplified in the top diagram, above, and its caption. The diagram can be in any orientation. The foot is not necessarily at the bottom. More precisely, let be a point and a line. If is the point of intersection of and the unique line through that is perpendicular to , then is called the foot of this perpendicular through .  Construction of the perpendicular  To make the perpendicular to the line AB through the point P using compass-and-straightedge construction, proceed as follows (see figure left): * Step 1 (red): construct a circle with center at P to create points A' and B' on the line AB, which are equidistant from P. * Step 2 (green): construct circles centered at A' and B' having equal radius. Let Q and P be the points of intersection of these two circles. * Step 3 (blue): connect Q and P to construct the desired perpendicular PQ. To prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the SSS congruence theorem for ' and QPB' to conclude that angles OPA' and OPB' are equal. Then use the SAS congruence theorem for triangles OPA' and OPB' to conclude that angles POA and POB are equal. To make the perpendicular to the line g at or through the point P using Thales's theorem, see the animation at right. The Pythagorean theorem can be used as the basis of methods of constructing right angles. For example, by counting links, three pieces of chain can be made with lengths in the ratio 3:4:5. These can be laid out to form a triangle, which will have a right angle opposite its longest side. This method is useful for laying out gardens and fields, where the dimensions are large, and great accuracy is not needed. The chains can be used repeatedly whenever required.  In relationship to parallel lines  The arrowhead marks indicate that the lines a and b, cut by the transversal line c, are parallel. If two lines (a and b) are both perpendicular to a third line (c), all of the angles formed along the third line are right angles. Therefore, in Euclidean geometry, any two lines that are both perpendicular to a third line are parallel to each other, because of the parallel postulate. Conversely, if one line is perpendicular to a second line, it is also perpendicular to any line parallel to that second line. In the figure at the right, all of the orange-shaded angles are congruent to each other and all of the green-shaded angles are congruent to each other, because vertical angles are congruent and alternate interior angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines are congruent. Therefore, if lines a and b are parallel, any of the following conclusions leads to all of the others: * One of the angles in the diagram is a right angle. * One of the orange-shaded angles is congruent to one of the green-shaded angles. * Line c is perpendicular to line a. * Line c is perpendicular to line b. In computing distances The distance from a point to a line is the distance to the nearest point on that line. That is the point at which a segment from it to the given point is perpendicular to the line. Likewise, the distance from a point to a curve is measured by a line segment that is perpendicular to a tangent line to the curve at the nearest point on the curve. Perpendicular regression fits a line to data points by minimizing the sum of squared perpendicular distances from the data points to the line. The distance from a point to a plane is measured as the length from the point along a segment that is perpendicular to the plane, meaning that it is perpendicular to all lines in the plane that pass through the nearest point in the plane to the given point.  Graph of functions  In the two-dimensional plane, right angles can be formed by two intersected lines if the product of their slopes equals ‚àí1. Thus defining two linear functions: and , the graphs of the functions will be perpendicular and will make four right angles where the lines intersect if . However, this method cannot be used if the slope is zero or undefined (the line is parallel to an axis). For another method, let the two linear functions be: and . The lines will be perpendicular if and only if . This method is simplified from the dot product (or, more generally, the inner product) of vectors. In particular, two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero. In circles and other conics =Circles= Each diameter of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent line to that circle at the point where the diameter intersects the circle. A line segment through a circle's center bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord. If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths a and b and divides the other chord into lengths c and d, then equals the square of the diameter.Posamentier and Salkind, Challenging Problems in Geometry, Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104‚Äì105, #4‚Äì23. The sum of the squared lengths of any two perpendicular chords intersecting at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8r2 ‚Äì 4p2 (where r is the circle's radius and p is the distance from the center point to the point of intersection).College Mathematics Journal 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635. Thales' theorem states that two lines both through the same point on a circle but going through opposite endpoints of a diameter are perpendicular. This is equivalent to saying that any diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circle, except the two endpoints of the diameter. =Ellipses= The major and minor axes of an ellipse are perpendicular to each other and to the tangent lines to the ellipse at the points where the axes intersect the ellipse. The major axis of an ellipse is perpendicular to the directrix and to each latus rectum. =Parabolas= In a parabola, the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to each of the latus rectum, the directrix, and the tangent line at the point where the axis intersects the parabola. From a point on the tangent line to a parabola's vertex, the other tangent line to the parabola is perpendicular to the line from that point through the parabola's focus. The orthoptic property of a parabola is that If two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents which intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. This implies that, seen from any point on its directrix, any parabola subtends a right angle. =Hyperbolas= The transverse axis of a hyperbola is perpendicular to the conjugate axis and to each directrix. The product of the perpendicular distances from a point P on a hyperbola or on its conjugate hyperbola to the asymptotes is a constant independent of the location of P. A rectangular hyperbola has asymptotes that are perpendicular to each other. It has an eccentricity equal to \\\\sqrt{2}. In polygons =Triangles= The legs of a right triangle are perpendicular to each other. The altitudes of a triangle are perpendicular to their respective bases. The perpendicular bisectors of the sides also play a prominent role in triangle geometry. The Euler line of an isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the triangle's base. The Droz-Farny line theorem concerns a property of two perpendicular lines intersecting at a triangle's orthocenter. Harcourt's theorem concerns the relationship of line segments through a vertex and perpendicular to any line tangent to the triangle's incircle. =Quadrilaterals= In a square or other rectangle, all pairs of adjacent sides are perpendicular. A right trapezoid is a trapezoid that has two pairs of adjacent sides that are perpendicular. Each of the four maltitudes of a quadrilateral is a perpendicular to a side through the midpoint of the opposite side. An orthodiagonal quadrilateral is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are perpendicular. These include the square, the rhombus, and the kite. By Brahmagupta's theorem, in an orthodiagonal quadrilateral that is also cyclic, a line through the midpoint of one side and through the intersection point of the diagonals is perpendicular to the opposite side. By van Aubel's theorem, if squares are constructed externally on the sides of a quadrilateral, the line segments connecting the centers of opposite squares are perpendicular and equal in length. Lines in three dimensions Up to three lines in three-dimensional space can be pairwise perpendicular, as exemplified by the x, y, and z axes of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

It is especially known for its beautiful gardens. History The lands where an ancient fortress once stood were known as Columbine until the 17th century. They were acquired in the early 16th century by Jean Le Breton, France's Controller-General for War under King Francis I, and a new ch√¢teau was constructed around the original 14th-century keep where King Philip II of France once met Richard I of England to discuss peace. The ch√¢teau remained in the Le Breton family for more than two centuries until it was acquired by the Marquis de Castellane. During the French Revolution the property was confiscated and in the early 19th century, Emperor Napoleon acquired it for his brother J√©r√¥me Bonaparte. In 1906, Joachim Carvallo purchased the property and poured an enormous amount of time, money and devotion into repairing it and creating extremely beautiful gardens. Its famous Renaissance gardens include a water garden, ornamental flower gardens, and vegetable gardens. The gardens are laid out in formal patterns created with low box hedges. In 1934, Ch√¢teau de Villandry was designated a Monument historique. Like all the other ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley, it is a World Heritage Site. Recent times Still owned by the Carvallo family, the Ch√¢teau de Villandry is open to the public and is one of the most visited ch√¢teaux in France; in 2007 the ch√¢teau received about 330,000 visitors.

At least sixty-nine Palestinian villagers were killed, two-thirds of them women and children. Forty-five houses, a school, and a mosque were destroyed.Benny Morris, Israel's Border Wars, 1949‚Äì1956: Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation and the Countdown to the Suez War, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 258‚Äì9. The attack followed cross-border raids from the Jordanian occupied West Bank and Israeli reprisals, in particular, the attack on Qibya was a response to the Yehud attack in which an Israeli woman and her two children were killed in their home. The act was condemned by the U.S. State Department, the UN Security Council, and by Jewish communities worldwide. The State Department described the raid as \\"shocking\\", and used the occasion to confirm publicly that economic aid to Israel had been suspended previously, for other non-compliance regarding the 1949 Armistice Agreements. The operation was codenamed Operation Shoshana by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It was carried out by two Israeli units at night: a paratroop company and Unit 101, a special forces unit of the IDF. Background The attack took place in the context of border clashes between Israel and neighbouring states, which had begun almost immediately after the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Along the 1949 armistice line, infiltrations, armed or otherwise, were frequent from both sides. Many infiltrations from Jordanian territory in the West Bank consisted of unarmed Palestinian refugees attempting to rejoin their families. During 1948‚Äì49, most of the infiltrators crossed the borders to harvest crops left behind, to plant new crops in their abandoned lands, or to retrieve goods. Many others came to resettle in their old villages or elsewhere inside Israel, or to visit relatives, or simply to get a glimpse of their abandoned homes and fields. During the following years the vast majority came to steal crops, irrigation pipes, farm animals, or other property belonging to settlers, or to graze their flocks. Some engaged in smuggling goods or mail‚Äîcertain items, such as Bedouin clothing, were often unavailable in Israel, and there were no postal services between Israel and the Arab states. Others moved through Israeli territory in order to reach other Arab countries, most frequently from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank. Most of the infiltrators were unarmed individuals, though it appears that the proportion who came armed and in groups steadily increased after 1950. Half of Jordan's prison population at the time consisted of people arrested for attempting to return to, or illegally enter, Israeli territory, but the number of complaints filed by Israel over infiltrations from the West Bank show a considerable reduction, from 233 in the first nine months of 1952, to 172 for the same period in 1953, immediately before the attack. This marked reduction was in good part the result of increased Jordanian efficiency in patrolling. Between June 1949 and the end of 1952, a total of 57 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed by Palestinian infiltrators from the Jordanian West Bank. The Israeli death toll for the first nine months of 1953 was 32.Which Came First- Terrorism or Occupation ‚Äì Major Arab Terrorist Attacks against Israelis Prior to the 1967 Six-Day War Over roughly the same time (November 1950 ‚Äì November 1953), the Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Israeli raids 44 times. For the same period, 1949‚Äì1953, Jordan maintained that it alone suffered 629 killed and injured from Israeli incursions and cross-border bombings. UN sources for the period, based on the documentation at General Bennike's disposal (prepared by Commander E H Hutchison USNR),Commander E H Hutchison USNR \\"Violent Truce: A Military Observer Looks at the Arab-Israeli Conflict 1951‚Äì1955‚Äù Chapter XI A Survey of the Whole Conflict p. 90-100 lower both estimates Over the year leading up to the raid, Israeli forces and civilians had conducted many punitive expeditions, causing destruction of infrastructure and crops and many civilian casualties against Palestinian villages, with Latrun, Falameh, Rantis, Qalqiliya, Khirbet al-Deir, Khirbet Rasm Nofal, Khirbet Beit Emin, Qatanna, Wadi Fukin, Idhna, and Surif being the most notable examples. Meanwhile, Palestinian guerilla raids into Israel continued. Over a two-week period in late May and early June, four raids by Palestinian fedayeen killed 3 and wounded 6 people in Israel, at Beit Arif, Beit Nabala, Tirat Yehuda and Kfar Hess which, according to the UN, greatly concerned both the Israeli and Jordanian governments. The specific incident which the Israeli government used to justify the assault on Qibya occurred on 12 October 1953, when a Jewish woman, Suzanne Kinyas, and her two children were killed by a grenade thrown into their house in the Israeli town of Yehud, some inside of the Green Line. The attack initially drew a sharp rebuke to Jordan from the Mixed Armistice Commission. The Israeli government immediately claimed that the killings were perpetrated by Palestinian infiltrators, a charge queried by Jordanian officials, who were skeptical, and who offered to collaborate with Israel in order to apprehend the guilty parties, whoever and wherever they were. Moshe Sharett said later that \\"the Commander of the Jordan Legion, Glubb Pasha, had asked for police bloodhounds to cross over from Israel to track down the Yahud attackers\\".Jerusalem Post, 31 October 1965) On the other hand, some weeks later, while assisting a United Nations and Jordanian team following the tracks of the person(s) who on 1 November had blown up a water-line in Jordanian territory supplying the Arab quarter of Jerusalem, tracks that led to the Scopus fence, the Israeli inspector delegated to the team denied them permission to enter the Jewish area around Mount Scopus and prosecute their investigation. For the first time, Israel accepted Jordan's offer of assistance and the tracks of the perpetrator were traced to a point 1400m over the border, to a road near Rantis, but dried up there. The United Nations observer team's investigation failed to find any evidence indicating who committed the crime, and the Jordanian delegate to the Mixed Commission condemned the act in strong language on 14 October.Commander E H Hutchison USNR \\"Violent Truce: A Military Observer Looks at the Arab-Israeli Conflict 1951‚Äì1955‚Äù (Acting Chairman of the HJKIMAC), Appendix BAvi Shlaim, The Iron Wall, pp 90‚Äì93 The Chief of Staff of the Arab Legion in Amman flew to Jerusalem to ask that no retaliatory actions take place that might compromise Jordanian investigations underway on their side of the border. According to the former Time correspondent to Jerusalem, Donald Neff, the decisive calculation was as follows: > Force had to be used to demonstrate to the Arabs that Israel was in the > Middle East to stay, Ben Gurion believed, and to that end he felt strongly > that his retaliatory policy had to be continued.Donald Neff, Warriors at > Suez: Eisenhower Takes America into the Middle East. The Linden Press/Simon > & Schuster. New York, 1981, pp. 48‚Äì50): Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon gave the order, in coordination with Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. The Israeli elected governing cabinet was not informed, and though Foreign Affairs Minister Moshe Sharett was privy to prior deliberations on whether or not such a punitive raid ought to be conducted, he expressed strong disapproval of the proposal, and was deeply shocked when informed of the outcome.In Sharett's diary we read: (1)'I told Lavon that this [attack] will be a grave error, and recalled, citing various precedents, that it was never proved that reprisal actions serve their declared purpose. Lavon smiled ... and kept to his own idea.... Ben Gurion, he said, didn't share my view.' (14 October 1953, p.37) (2) 'I must underline that when I opposed the action I didn't even remotely suspect such a bloodbath. I thought that I was opposing one of those actions which have become a routine in the past. Had I even remotely suspected that such a massacre was to be held, I would have raised real hell.

Later sources state the force consisted of 130 IDF troops of whom a third came from Unit 101.Morris, Benny (1993) Israel's Border Wars, 1949 ‚Äì 1956. Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War. Oxford University Press, . Page 246. The American chairman of the Mixed Armistice Commission in his report to the UN Security Council estimated that between 250 and 300 Israeli soldiers were involved in the attack.Hutchinson, E.H. (1958) Violent Truce: A Military Observer Looks at The Arab-Israeli Conflict 1951‚Äì1955 Devin- Adair Co. New York. Page 161. The attack began with a mortar barrage on the village until Israeli forces reached the outskirts of the village. Israeli troops employed Bangalore torpedoes to breach the barbed-wire fences surrounding the village, and mined roads to prevent Jordanian forces from intervening. At the same time at least 25 mortar shells were fired into the neighbouring village of Budrus. The Israeli troops simultaneously entered the village from three sides. IDF soldiers encountered resistance from soldiers and village guards, and in the gunbattle that followed, 10‚Äì12 soldiers and guards defending the village were killed and an Israeli soldier was lightly wounded. The soldiers did not thoroughly inspect the homes in the village for the presence of residents, and when military engineers dynamited dozens of buildings across the village, scores of civilians were killed. At dawn, the operation was considered complete, and the Israelis returned home.Ariel Sharon ‚Äì Biography: 1953 Retribution Acts (Pe'ulot Tagmul) Ariel Sharon, who led the attack, later wrote in his diary that he had received orders to inflict heavy damage on the Arab Legion forces in Qibya: 'The orders were utterly clear: Qibya was to be an example for everyone'. Original documents of the time showed that Sharon personally ordered his troops to achieve \\"maximal killing and damage to property\\", and post-operational reports speak of breaking into houses and clearing them with grenades and shooting.Benny Morris, Israel's Border Wars, ibid. pp. 257‚Äì276. esp. pp.249,262 Sharon then later said that he had \\"thought the houses were empty\\" and that the unit had checked all houses before detonating the explosives. In his autobiography Warrior (1987) Sharon wrote: > I couldn't believe my ears. As I went back over each step of the operation, > I began to understand what must have happened. For years Israeli reprisal > raids had never succeeded in doing more than blowing up a few outlying > buildings, if that.

In those big stone houses [...] > some could easily have hidden in the cellars and back rooms, keeping quiet > when the paratroopers went in to check and yell out a warning. The result > was this tragedy that had happened. UN observers noted that they observed bodies near doorways, and bullet marks on the doors of demolished houses, and later concluded that residents may have been forced to stay in their homes due to heavy fire. International reaction An emergency meeting of the Mixed Armistice Commission (MAC) was held in the afternoon of 15 October and a resolution condemning the regular Israel army for its attack on Qibya, as a breach of article III, paragraph 2,62/ of the Israel-Jordan General Armistice Agreement was adopted by a majority vote. The attack was universally condemned by the international community. The U.S. State Department issued a bulletin on 18 October 1953, expressing its \\"deepest sympathy for the families of those who lost their lives\\" in Qibya as well as the conviction that those responsible \\"should be brought to account and that effective measures should be taken to prevent such incidents in the future.\\"The Department of State issued a statement on 18 October 1953 (Department of State Bulletin, 26 October 1953, p. 552). The State Department described the raid as \\"shocking\\", and used the occasion to confirm publicly that economic aid to Israel had been previously suspended.New York Times, 19 October 1953, 1:5, cited in, Stephen Green, Taking Sides: America's Secret Relations with a Militant Israel, p.87 The aid, as Israel had been informed on 18 September, had been \\"deferred\\" until Israel saw fit to cooperate with the United Nations in the Demilitarized Zone, in relation to its ongoing water diversion work near Bnot Ya'akov Bridge;Stephen Green, Taking Sides: America's Secret Relations with a Militant Israel. p.80 that site had been chosen as the original location for the intake of Israel's National Water Carrier, but it would be moved downstream to the Sea of Galilee at Eshed Kinrot, following this US pressure.Sosland, Jeffrey (2007) Cooperating Rivals: The Riparian Politics of the Jordan River Basin SUNY Press, p 70 The UN Security Council subsequently adopted Resolution 100 on 27 October 1953. On 24 November, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 101 and expressed the \\"strongest possible censure of this action\\". Israeli reaction The international outcry caused by the operation required a formal reply by Israel. Intense discussions took place, and Moshe Sharett summed up, in his diary on 16 October, the opinion that: > Now the army wants to know how we (the Foreign Ministry) are going to > explain the issue. In a joint meeting of army and foreign ministry officials > Shmuel Bendor suggested that we say that the army had no part in the > operation, but that the inhabitants of the border villages, infuriated by > previous incidents and seeking revenge, operated on their own. Such a > version will make us appear ridiculous: any child would say that this was a > military operation. (16 October 1953)Livia Rokach, Israel's Sacred > Terrorism, ibid. Notwithstanding Sharett's advice that broadcasting this version would make Israel appear patently \\"ridiculous\\", on 19 October Ben-Gurion publicly asserted that the raid had been carried out by Israeli civilians. > None deplores it more than the Government of Israel, if ... innocent blood > was spilled ... The Government of Israel rejects with all vigor the absurd > and fantastic allegation that 600 men of the IDF took part in the action ... > We have carried out a searching investigation and it is clear beyond doubt > that not a single army unit was absent from its base on the night of the > attack on Qibya. (Statement by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, ISA FM > 2435/5) On Israeli Radio that same day, Ben-Gurion addressed the nation, repeating the accusation that the massacre had been perpetrated by Israeli civilians: > The [Jewish] border settlers in Israel, mostly refugees, people from Arab > countries and survivors from the Nazi concentration camps, have, for years, > been the target of (...) murderous attacks and had shown a great restraint. > Rightfully, they have demanded that their government protect their lives and > the Israeli government gave them weapons and trained them to protect > themselves. But the armed forces from Transjordan did not stop their > criminal acts, until [the people in] some of the border settlements lost > their patience and after the murder of a mother and her two children in > Yahud, they attacked, last week, the village of Kibya across the border, > that was one of the main centers of the murderers' gangs. Every one of us > regrets and suffers when blood is shed anywhere and nobody regrets more than > the Israeli government the fact that innocent people were killed in the > retaliation act in Kibya.

APPENDIX 1 Israeli historian Avi Shlaim observed that the official Israeli version was not believed, and it did nothing to reduce the damage to Israel's image. \\"This was not Ben-Gurion's first lie for what he saw as the good of his country, nor was it to be the last, but it was one of the most blatant.\\" Uri Avnery, founder and editor of the magazine HaOlam HaZeh, relates that he had both his hands broken when he was ambushed for criticizing the massacre at Qibya in his newspaper.Uri Avnery Biography Results According to Daniel Byman, the attack, \\"controversial, brutal, and bloody - worked,\\" leading Jordan to arrest more than a thousand fedayeen and stepped up its patrolling of the border. Following the attack, the Arab Legion forces deployed on the border segment near Qibya to stop further infiltrations and deter further Israeli incursions. There was a brief overall reduction in incursions along the border. After this incident, Israel restricted attacks on civilian targets. Despite the U.S. request that those involved be brought to account, Sharon was not prosecuted. The independence of Unit 101 was cancelled and several weeks later it was dismantled altogether.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, A history of the Zionist-Arab Conflict 1881‚Äì2001, First Vintage books, 2001. p.279. \\"After Qibya the IDF switched from civilian to military targets. Arab civilian casualties declined markedly, reducing Western condemnation of \\"indiscriminate\\" Israeli reprisals.

July 313) was Roman emperor from 310 to 313. He became embroiled in the Civil wars of the Tetrarchy between rival claimants for control of the empire, in which he was defeated by Licinius. A committed pagan, he engaged in one of the last persecutions of Christians. Early career He was born of peasant stock to the sister of the emperor Galerius near their family lands around Felix Romuliana, in Dacia Ripensis, a rural area then in the former Danubian region of Moesia, now Eastern Serbia.Roman Colosseum, Maximinus Daza He rose to high distinction after joining the army. In 305, his maternal uncle Galerius became the eastern Augustus and adopted Maximinus, raising him to the rank of caesar (in effect, the junior eastern Emperor), and granting him the government of Syria and Egypt. Civil war In 308, after the elevation of Licinius to Augustus, Maximinus and Constantine were declared filii Augustorum (\\"sons of the Augusti\\"), but Maximinus probably started styling himself as Augustus during a campaign against the Sassanids in 310. On the death of Galerius in 311, Maximinus divided the Eastern Empire between Licinius and himself. When Licinius and Constantine began to make common cause, Maximinus entered into a secret alliance with the usurper Caesar Maxentius, who controlled Italy. He came to an open rupture with Licinius in 313; he summoned an army of 70,000 men but sustained a crushing defeat at the Battle of Tzirallum in the neighbourhood of Heraclea Perinthus on 30 April. He fled, first to Nicomedia and afterwards to Tarsus, where he died the following August. Persecution of Christians Maximinus has a bad name in Christian annals for renewing their persecution after the publication of the Edict of Toleration by Galerius, acting in response to the demands of various urban authorities asking to expel Christians. In one rescript replying to a petition made by the inhabitants of Tyre, transcribed by Eusebius of Caesarea,Ecclesiastical History , IX, 8-9 ; Eng. trans. available at . Accessed 2 August 2012 Maximinus expounds an pagan orthodoxy, explaining that it is through \\"the kindly care of the gods\\" that one could hope for good crops, health, and the peaceful sea, and that not being the case, one should blame \\"the destructive error of the empty vanity of those impious men [that] weighed down the whole world with shame\\". In one extant inscription (CIL III.12132, from Arycanda) from the cities of Lycia and Pamphylia asking for the interdiction of the Christians, Maximinus replied, in another inscription, by expressing his hope that \\"may those [...] who, after being freed from [...] those by-ways [...] rejoice [as] snatched from a grave illness\\".John Granger Cook, The Interpretation of the New Testament in Greco- Roman Paganism. T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2000, , page 304, footnote 175 After the victory of Constantine over Maxentius, however, Maximinus wrote to the Praetorian Prefect Sabinus that it was better to \\"recall our provincials to the worship of the gods rather by exhortations and flatteries\\".Ecclesiastical History, IX, 1-10 Eventually, on the eve of his clash with Licinius, he accepted Galerius' edict; after being defeated by Licinius, shortly before his death at Tarsus, he issued an edict of tolerance on his own, granting Christians the rights of assembling, of building churches, and the restoration of their confiscated properties.Ecclesiastical History, X, 7-11 Plaster cast in the Pushkin Museum of a porphyry bust of a tetrarchic-era emperor from Athribis ‚Äì now in the Cairo Museum ‚Äì labelled as Maximinus Daia Death Maximinus' death was variously ascribed \\"to despair, to poison, and to the divine justice\\".Gibbon, Edward, 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire', Chapter 14 Based on descriptions of his death given by Eusebius,Ecclesiastical History, IX, 14-15, and LactantiusLactantius, On the Deaths of the Persecutors, Chapter XLIX as well as the appearance of Graves' ophthalmopathy in a Tetrarchic statue bust from Anthribis in Egypt sometimes attributed to Maximinus, endocrinologist Peter D. Papapetrou has advanced a theory that Maximinus may have died from severe thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease.Peter D. Papapetrou, Hormones 2013, 12(1):142-145 Maximinus was the last Roman emperor, and thus the last individual, to hold the title of pharaoh, making his death the end of a 3,400-year-old office. Eusebius on Maximinus The Christian writer Eusebius claims that Maximinus was consumed by avarice and superstition. He also allegedly lived a highly dissolute lifestyle: > And he went to such an excess of folly and drunkenness that his mind was > deranged and crazed in his carousals; and he gave commands when intoxicated > of which he repented afterward when sober. He suffered no one to surpass him > in debauchery and profligacy, but made himself an instructor in wickedness > to those about him, both rulers and subjects. He urged on the army to live > wantonly in every kind of revelry and intemperance, and encouraged the > governors and generals to abuse their subjects with rapacity and > covetousness, almost as if they were rulers with him. > Why need we relate the licentious, shameless deeds of the man, or enumerate > the multitude with whom he committed adultery? For he could not pass through > a city without continually corrupting women and ravishing > virgins.Ecclesiastical History, VIII, 14. According to Eusebius, only Christians resisted him. > For the men endured fire and sword and crucifixion and wild beasts and the > depths of the sea, and cutting off of limbs, and burnings, and pricking and > digging out of eyes, and mutilations of the entire body, and besides these, > hunger and mines and bonds. In all they showed patience in behalf of > religion rather than transfer to idols the reverence due to God. And the > women were not less manly than the men in behalf of the teaching of the > Divine Word, as they endured conflicts with the men, and bore away equal > prizes of virtue. And when they were dragged away for corrupt purposes, they > surrendered their lives to death rather than their bodies to impurity. He refers to one high-born Christian woman who rejected his advances. He exiled her and seized all of her wealth and assets. Eusebius does not give the girl a name, but Tyrannius Rufinus calls her \\"Dorothea,\\" and writes that she fled to Arabia. This story may have evolved into the legend of Dorothea of Alexandria. Caesar Baronius identified the girl in Eusebius' account with Catherine of Alexandria, but the Bollandists rejected this theory.

A line segment (AB) drawn so that it forms right angles with a line (CD). In geometry and trigonometry, a right angle is an angle of exactly 90¬∞ (degrees), corresponding to a quarter turn.Wentworth p. 11 If a ray is placed so that its endpoint is on a line and the adjacent angles are equal, then they are right angles.Wentworth p. 8 The term is a calque of Latin angulus rectus; here rectus means \\"upright\\", referring to the vertical perpendicular to a horizontal base line. Closely related and important geometrical concepts are perpendicular lines, meaning lines that form right angles at their point of intersection, and orthogonality, which is the property of forming right angles, usually applied to vectors. The presence of a right angle in a triangle is the defining factor for right triangles,Wentworth p. 40 making the right angle basic to trigonometry.  Etymology  The meaning of \\"right\\" in \\"right angle\\" possibly refers to the latin adjective rectus, which can be translated into erect, straight, upright or perpendicular. A Greek equivalent is orthos, which means straight or perpendicular (see orthogonality). The term right angle therefore does not refer to right and left handedness, and thus there is no corresponding mathematical concept called a left angle. For reference, the corresponding Greek and Latin words for parts on the right handed side of the body are dexios and dexter, respectively.  In elementary geometry  A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. A square has four right angles, in addition to equal-length sides. The Pythagorean theorem states how to determine when a triangle is a right triangle.  Symbols  Right triangle, with the right angle shown via a small square. Another option of diagrammatically indicating a right angle, using an angle curve and a small dot. In Unicode, the symbol for a right angle is . It should not be confused with the similarly shaped symbol . Related symbols are , , and .Unicode 5.2 Character Code Charts Mathematical Operators, Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B In diagrams, the fact that an angle is a right angle is usually expressed by adding a small right angle that forms a square with the angle in the diagram, as seen in the diagram of a right triangle (in British English, a right-angled triangle) to the right. The symbol for a measured angle, an arc, with a dot, is used in some European countries, including German-speaking countries and Poland, as an alternative symbol for a right angle.  Euclid  Right angles are fundamental in Euclid's Elements. They are defined in Book 1, definition 10, which also defines perpendicular lines. Definition 10 does not use numerical degree measurements but rather touches at the very heart of what a right angle is, namely two straight lines intersecting to form two equal and adjacent angles.Heath p. 181 The straight lines which form right angles are called perpendicular.Heath p. 181 Euclid uses right angles in definitions 11 and 12 to define acute angles (those smaller than a right angle) and obtuse angles (those greater than a right angle).Heath p. 181 Two angles are called complementary if their sum is a right angle.Wentworth p. 9 Book 1 Postulate 4 states that all right angles are equal, which allows Euclid to use a right angle as a unit to measure other angles with. Euclid's commentator Proclus gave a proof of this postulate using the previous postulates, but it may be argued that this proof makes use of some hidden assumptions. Saccheri gave a proof as well but using a more explicit assumption. In Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry this statement is given as a theorem, but only after much groundwork. One may argue that, even if postulate 4 can be proven from the preceding ones, in the order that Euclid presents his material it is necessary to include it since without it postulate 5, which uses the right angle as a unit of measure, makes no sense.Heath pp. 200-201 for the paragraph  Conversion to other units  A right angle may be expressed in different units: * turn * 90¬∞ (degrees) * radians or rad * 100 grad (also called grade, gradian, or gon) * 8 points (of a 32-point compass rose) * 6 hours (astronomical hour angle)  Rule of 3-4-5  Throughout history, carpenters and masons have known a quick way to confirm if an angle is a true \\"right angle\\". It is based on the most widely known Pythagorean triple and so called the \\"rule of 3-4-5\\". From the angle in question, running a straight line along one side exactly 3 units in length, and along the second side exactly 4 units in length, will create a hypotenuse (the longer line opposite the right angle that connects the two measured endpoints) of exactly 5 units in length. This measurement can be made quickly and without technical instruments. The geometric law behind the measurement is the Pythagorean theorem (\\"The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the two adjacent sides\\").  Thales' theorem  Thales' theorem states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle (with a vertex on the semicircle and its defining rays going through the endpoints of the semicircle) is a right angle. Two application examples in which the right angle and the Thales' theorem are included (see animations).

He was the son of former Emperor Maximian and the son-in-law of Emperor Galerius. The latter part of his reign was preoccupied with civil war, allying with Maximinus II against Licinius and Constantine. The latter defeated him at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312, where Maxentius, with his army in flight, purportedly perished by drowning in the Tiber river. Life = Birth and Early Life = Maxentius' exact date of birth is unknown; it was probably somewhere from 276 to 283. He was the son of the Emperor Maximian and his wife Eutropia. As his father became emperor in 285, he was regarded as crown prince who would eventually follow his father on the throne. He seems not to have served, however, in any important military or administrative position during the reign of Diocletian and his father. The exact date of his marriage to Valeria Maximilla, daughter of Galerius, is unknown. He had two sons, Valerius Romulus (ca. 295 ‚Äì 309) and an unknown one. In 305, Diocletian and Maximian abdicated, and the former caesares Constantius and Galerius became Augusti. Although two sons of emperorsConstantine and Maxentiuswere available, they were passed over for the new tetrarchy, and Severus and Maximinus Daia were appointed Caesars. Lactantius' Epitome states that Galerius hated Maxentius and used his influence with Diocletian to see that Maxentius was ignored in the succession; perhaps Diocletian also thought Maxentius was not qualified for the military duties of the imperial office. Maxentius retired to an estate some miles from Rome. When Constantius died in 306, his son Constantine was crowned emperor on July 25 and subsequently accepted by Galerius into the tetrarchy as Caesar. This set the precedent for Maxentius' accession later in the same year. =Accession= The Basilica of Maxentius in the Roman Forum. Completed by his enemy Constantine, it was one of the most impressive edifices of ancient times. When rumours reached the capital that the emperors tried to subject the Roman population to the capitation tax, like every other city of the empire, and wanted to dissolve the remains of the Praetorian Guard which were still stationed at Rome, riots broke out. A group of officers of the city's garrisons (Zosimus calls them Marcellianus, Marcellus and Lucianus) turned to Maxentius to accept the imperial purple, probably judging that the official recognition which was granted to Constantine would not be withheld from Maxentius, son of an emperor as well. Maxentius accepted the honour, promised donations to the city's troops, and was publicly acclaimed emperor on October 28, 306. The usurpation obviously went largely without bloodshed (Zosimus names only one victim); the prefect of Rome went over to Maxentius and retained his office. Apparently the conspirators turned to Maximian as well, who had retired to a palace in Lucania, but he declined to resume power for the time being. Maxentius managed to be recognized as emperor in central and southern Italy, the islands of Corsica and Sardinia and Sicily, and the African provinces. Northern Italy remained under the control of the western Augustus Severus, who resided in Mediolanum (Milan). Maxentius refrained from using the titles Augustus or Caesar at first and styled himself princeps invictus (\\"undefeated prince\\"), in the hope of obtaining recognition of his reign by the senior emperor Galerius. However, the latter refused to do so. Apart from his alleged antipathy towards Maxentius, Galerius probably wanted to deter others from following the examples of Constantine and Maxentius and declaring themselves emperors. Constantine firmly controlled his father's army and territories, and Galerius could pretend that his accession was part of the regular succession in the tetrarchy, but neither was the case with Maxentius: he would be the fifth emperor, and he had only few troops at his command. Galerius reckoned that it would be not too difficult to quell the usurpation, and early in 307, the Augustus Severus marched on Rome with a large army. The majority of this army consisted of soldiers who had fought under Maxentius' father Maximian for years, and as Severus reached Rome, the majority of his army went over to Maxentius, rightful heir of their former commander, who dealt out a large amount of money. When Maximian himself finally left his retreat and returned to Rome to assume the imperial office once again and support his son, Severus with the rest of his army retreated to Ravenna. Shortly after, he surrendered to Maximian, who promised that his life would be spared. After the defeat of Severus, Maxentius took possession of northern Italy up to the Alps and the Istrian peninsula to the east, and assumed the title of Augustus, which (in his eyes) had become vacant with the surrender of Severus. =Emperor= Augustus on a follis. Legend: IMPerator Caesar MAXENTIVS Pius Felix AVGustus / HETERNITAS AVGusti MOSter - M OST Q (mint Ostia, officina Q). The joint rule of Maxentius and Maximian in Rome was tested further when Galerius himself marched to Italy in the summer of 307 with an even larger army. While negotiating with the invader, Maxentius could repeat what he did to Severus: by the promise of large sums of money, and the authority of Maximian, many soldiers of Galerius defected to him. Galerius was forced to withdraw, plundering Italy on his way. Some time during the invasion, Severus was put to death by Maxentius, probably at Tres Tabernae near Rome (the exact circumstances of his death are not certain). After the failed campaign of Galerius, Maxentius' reign over Italy and Africa was firmly established. Beginning in 307 already, he tried to arrange friendly contacts with Constantine, and in the summer of that year, Maximian travelled to Gaul, where Constantine married his daughter Fausta and was in turn appointed Augustus by the senior emperor. However, Constantine tried to avoid breaking with Galerius, and did not openly support Maxentius during the invasion. In 308, probably April, Maximian tried to depose his son in an assembly of soldiers in Rome; surprisingly to him, the present troops remained faithful to his son, and he had to flee to Constantine. In the conference of Carnuntum, in the autumn of that same year, Maxentius was once again denied recognition as legitimate emperor, and Licinius was appointed Augustus with the task of regaining the usurper's domain. Late in 308, Domitius Alexander was acclaimed emperor in Carthage, and the African provinces seceded from Maxentian rule. This produced a dangerous situation for Maxentius, as Africa was critical to Rome's food supply. Circus of Maxentius in ancient times Maxentius' eldest son Valerius Romulus died in 309, at the age of about fourteen, was deified and buried in a mausoleum in the Villa of Maxentius at the Via Appia. Nearby, Maxentius also constructed the Circus of Maxentius. After the death of Maximian in 309 or 310, relations with Constantine rapidly deteriorated, and Maxentius allied with Maximinus to counter an alliance between Constantine and Licinius. He allegedly tried to secure the province of Raetia north of the Alps, thereby dividing the realms of Constantine and Licinius (reported by Zosimus); the plan was not carried out, as Constantine acted first. In 310, Maxentius lost Istria to Licinius, who could not continue the campaign. However, by the middle of 310 Galerius had become too ill to involve himself in imperial politicsLactantius, 31‚Äì35; Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 8.16. Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 43; Jones, 66; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 68; Odahl, 95‚Äì96, 316. and he died soon after April 30, 311.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 39; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 43‚Äì44; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 68; Odahl, 95‚Äì96. Galerius' death destabilized what remained of the Tetrarchic system.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 41; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 45; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 69; Odahl, 96. On hearing the news, Maximinus mobilized against Licinius, and seized Asia Minor before meeting Licinius on the Bosphorus to arrange terms for peace.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 39‚Äì40; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 44; Odahl, 96. In the meantime, Maxentius fortified northern Italy against potential invasions and sent a small army to Africa under the command of his praetorian prefect Rufius Volusianus which defeated and executed the usurper Domitius Alexander in 310 or 311. Maxentius used the opportunity to seize the wealth of his supporters, and to bring large amounts of grain to Rome. He also strengthened his support among the Christians of Italy by allowing them to elect a new Bishop of Rome, Eusebius.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 38; Odahl, 96. Maxentius was far from secure, however. His early support was dissolving into open protest;Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 68. by 312, he was a man barely tolerated, not one actively supported.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 37. Without the revenues of the empire, Maxentius was forced to resume taxation in Italy to support his army and his building projects in Rome.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 36‚Äì37; Odahl, 99. The election of a bishop did not aid much, either, as Diocletian's persecution had split the Italian church into competing factions over the issue of apostasy (see Donatism). The Christians of Italy could easily see that Constantine was more sympathetic to their plight than Maxentius.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 38‚Äì39. In the summer of 311, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East. He declared war on Constantine, vowing to avenge his father's \\"murder\\".Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 40. Constantine, in an attempt to prevent Maxentius from forming a hostile alliance with Licinius,Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 41. forged his own alliance with the man over the winter of 311‚Äì12 by offering to him his sister Constantia in marriage. Maximinus Daia considered Constantine's arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering political recognition to Maxentius in exchange for military support.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 41; Elliott, Christianity of Constantine, 44‚Äì45; Lenski, \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 69; Odahl, 96. Two alliances, Maximinus Daia and Maxentius, Constantine and Licinius, lined up against one another. The emperors prepared for war.Odahl, 96. =War against Constantine= Maxentius expected an attack along his eastern flank from Licinius, and stationed an army in Verona.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 41; Odahl, 99‚Äì100. Constantine had smaller forces than his opponent: with his forces withdrawn from Africa, with the praetorian and Imperial Horse Guard, and with the troops he had taken from Severus, Maxentius had an army equal to approximately 100,000 soldiers to use against his opponents in the north. Many of these he used to garrison fortified towns across the region, keeping most stationed with him in Verona. Against this, Constantine could only bring a force of between twenty-five and forty thousand men. The bulk of his troops simply could not be withdrawn from the Rhine frontiers without negative consequences.Odahl, 99‚Äì100. It was against the recommendations of his advisers and generals, against popular expectation, that Constantine anticipated Maxentius, and struck first. Battle of Constantine and Maxentius (detail-of- fresco-in-Vatican-Stanze) c1650 by Lazzaro Baldi after Giulio Romano at the University of Edinburgh As early as weather permitted, late in the spring of 312,Odahl, 101. Constantine crossed the Alps with a quarter of his total army, a force equivalent to something less than forty thousand men. Having crossed the Cottian Alps at the Mont Cenis pass, he first came to Segusium (Susa, Italy), a heavily fortified town containing a military garrison, which shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his forces to set its gates on fire and scale its walls, and took the town quickly. Constantine forbade the plunder of the town, and advanced into northern Italy.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 41; Odahl, 101. At the approach to the west of the important city of Augusta Taurinorum (Turin, Italy), Constantine encountered a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry,Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 41; Odahl, 101‚Äì02. labeled clibanarii or cataphracti in the ancient sources. In the ensuing battle Constantine spread his forces into a line, allowing Maxentius' cavalry to ride into the middle of his forces. As his forces broadly encircled the enemy cavalry, Constantine's own cavalry charged at the sides of the Maxentian cataphracts, beating them with iron-tipped clubs. Many Maxentian cavalrymen were dismounted, while most others were variously incapacitated by the blows. Constantine then commanded his foot soldiers to advance against the surviving Maxentian infantry, cutting them down as they fled.Panegyrici Latini 12(9).5‚Äì6; 4(10).21‚Äì24; Odahl, 102, 317‚Äì18. Victory, the panegyrist who speaks of the events declares, came easily.Panegyrici Latini 12(9).8.1; 4(10).25.1; Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 41, 305. Turin refused to give refuge to the retreating forces of Maxentius. It opened its gates to Constantine instead. Other cities of the north Italian plain, recognizing Constantine's quick and clement victories, sent him embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. He resided there until the middle of the summer of 312 before moving on.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 41‚Äì42; Odahl, 103. The Battle of the Milvian Bridge by Giulio Romano It was expected that Maxentius would try the same strategy as against Severus and Galerius earlier; that is, remaining in the well- defended city of Rome, and sit out a siege which would cost his enemy much more. For somewhat uncertain reasons, he abandoned this plan, however, and offered battle to Constantine near the Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312. Ancient sources usually attribute this action to superstition or (if pro- Constantinian) divine providence. Maxentius of course had consulted soothsayers before battle, as was customary practice, and it can be assumed that they reported favourable omens, especially as the day of battle would be his dies imperii, the day of his accession to the throne (which was 28 October 306). What else may have motivated him, is open to speculation. The armies of Maxentius and Constantine met north of the city, some distance outside the walls, beyond the Tiber river on the Via Flaminia. Christian tradition, especially Lactantius and Eusebius of Caesarea, claims that Constantine fought under the labarum in that battle, revealed to him in a dream. Of the battle itself, not much is known ‚Äì Constantine's forces defeated Maxentius's troops, who retreated to the Tiber, and in the chaos of the fleeing army trying to cross the river, Maxentius fell into the water and drowned. His body was found the next day and paraded through the city, and later sent to Africa, as a sign that he had surely perished. Overview and legacy A Nummus of Maxentius. Legend: IMPerator MAXENTIVS Pius Felix AVGustus After Constantine's victory, Maxentius was systematically vilified and presented as a cruel, bloodthirsty and incompetent tyrant. While he was not counted under the persecutors of the Christians by early sources like Lactantius, under the influence of the official propaganda later Christian tradition framed Maxentius as hostile to Christianity as well. This image has left its traces in all of our sources and has dominated the view of Maxentius well into the 20th century, when a more extensive use and analysis of non-literary sources like coins and inscriptions have led to a more balanced image. Maxentius was a prolific builder, whose achievements were overshadowed by Constantine's issue of a damnatio memoriae against him. Many buildings in Rome that are commonly associated with Constantine, such as the great basilica in the forum Romanum, were in fact built by Maxentius.Cullhed, M (1994) Conservator Urbis Suae Stockholm; Kerr, L (2001) A topography of death: the buildings of the emperor Maxentius on the Via Appia, Rome In M Carruthers et al (eds) Eleventh Annual Proceedings of the Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference pp.24‚Äì33 Oxford: Oxbow =Discovery of Imperial insignia= In December 2006, Italian archaeologists announced that an excavation under a shrine near the Palatine Hill had unearthed several items in wooden boxes, which they identified as the imperial regalia, possibly belonging to Maxentius.http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/749781864 The items in these boxes, which were wrapped in linen and what appears to be silk, include 3 complete lances, 4 javelins, what appears to be a base for standards, and three glass and chalcedony spheres. The most important find was a scepter of a flower holding a blue-green globe, which is believed to have belonged to the Emperor himself because of its intricate workmanship, and has been dated to his rule. These are the only known imperial insignia so far recovered, which hitherto had only been known from representations on coins and in relief sculptures. Clementina Panella, the archaeologist who made the discovery, states that \\"These artifacts clearly belonged to the emperor, especially the scepter, which is very elaborate. It's not an item you would let someone else have.\\" Panella notes that the insignia were likely hidden by Maxentius' supporters in an attempt to preserve the emperor's memory after he was defeated at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge by Constantine.The Times, online edition The items have been restored and are on temporary display at the Museo Nazionale Romano at the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme. In popular culture Maxentius is the main antagonist of the 1961 film Constantine and the Cross. The character is played by Massimo Serato. Maxentius is portrayed in the 5th episode of Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire. In the 2014 film Katherine of Alexandria, Maxentius was portrayed by Julien Vialon.

Lobatae). Pin oak is one of the most commonly used landscaping oaks in its native range due to its ease of transplant, relatively fast growth, and pollution tolerance. Its distinctive shape is considered unique among hardwoods.\\"Oak, Pin Quercus palustris\\", http://www.arborday.org/treeguide/TreeDetail.cfm?id=19\\"Pin Oak\\", http://www.treehelp.com/pin-oak/ Distribution Q. palustris is mainly distributed in the eastern and central United States from Connecticut west to eastern Kansas, and south to Georgia, west to eastern Oklahoma and Kansas. It is also native in the extreme south of Ontario, Canada. The pin oak is also well adapted to life in Australia (where it has been introduced), and is quite widespread across the Australian continent, especially in the cooler southern States such as Victoria and New South Wales. It is also well adapted to life in South Africa and Argentina, especially in the R√≠o de la Plata region. Pin oaks grow primarily on level or nearly level, poorly drained, alluvial floodplain and river-bottom soils with high clay content. They are usually found on sites that flood intermittently during the dormant season, but do not ordinarily flood during the growing season. They do not grow on the lowest, most poorly drained sites that may be covered with standing water through much of the growing season. However, they do grow extensively on poorly drained upland \\"pin oak flats\\" on the glacial till plains of southwestern Ohio, southern Illinois and Indiana, and northern Missouri. The level topography and presence of a claypan in the soil of these areas cause these sites to be excessively wet in winter and spring. Mature pin oak displaying typical bronze fall coloration Description Pin oak is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to tall, with a trunk up to diameter. It has an spread. A 10-year-old tree grown in full sun will be about tall. Young trees have a straight, columnar trunk with smooth bark and a pyramidal canopy. By the time the tree is 40 years old, it develops more rough bark with a loose, spreading canopy. This canopy is considered one of the most distinctive features of the pin oak: the upper branches point upwards, the middle branches are at right angles to the trunk, and the lower branches droop downwards. The leaves are long and broad, lobed, with five or seven lobes. Each lobe has five to seven bristle- tipped teeth. The sinuses are typically u-shaped and extremely deep cut. In fact, roughly the same amount of sinus area exists as actual leaf area. The leaf is mostly hairless, except for a very characteristic tuft of pale orange- brown down on the lower surface where each lobe vein joins the central vein. Overall autumn leaf coloration is generally bronze, though individual leaves may be red for a time, and is not considered particularly distinctive. The acorns, borne in a shallow, thin cap, are hemispherical, long and broad, green maturing pale brown about 18 months after pollination. The acorn is unpalatable because the kernel is very bitter. A fast-growing pioneer or riparian species, pin oak is relatively short-lived, with a maximum lifespan of 120 years against many oaks which can live several centuries. It is naturally a wetland tree, and develops a shallow, fibrous root system, unlike many oaks, which have a strong, deep taproot when young. It is confined to acidic soils, and does not tolerate limestone or sandy Florida soil, and grows at low altitudes from sea level up to . The Latin specific epithet palustris means \\"of swamps\\". A characteristic shared by a few other oak species, and also some beeches and hornbeams, is the retention of leaves through the winter on juvenile trees, a natural phenomenon referred to as marcescence. Young trees under are often covered with leaves year-round, though the leaves die in the fall, remaining attached to the shoots until the new leaves appear in the spring. As with many other oak species, dead pin oak branches stay on the tree for many years. Leaves Flowering and fruiting Like all oaks, flowering and leaf-out occur in late spring when all frost danger has passed. The flowers are monoecious catkins which, being self-incompatible, require the presence of another oak for pollination. Any species in the red oak group can serve as a pollinator, but in pin oak's natural range, this will usually be northern red oak or scarlet oak. Interspecies hybridization occurs freely. The acorns require two growing seasons to develop. Catkins of pin oak Associated forest cover Pin oak is a major species in only one forest cover type, pin oak‚Äìsweetgum, which is found on bottom lands and some upland sites throughout the central portion of the pin oak range. Pin oak and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) vary in their relative proportions in this cover type. Large areas of almost pure pin oak occur on the \\"pin oak flats\\" of the upland glacial till plains or in the bottom lands of the lower Ohio and central Mississippi River valleys. Associated species in this forest type include red maple (Acer rubrum), American elm (Ulmus americana), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), willow oak (Quercus phellos), overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), Nuttall's oak (Quercus texana), swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii), and shellbark (Carya laciniosa) and shagbark (Carya ovata) hickories. Pin oak is an associated species in silver maple‚ÄìAmerican elm forests in the bottom lands along the Ohio, Wabash, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers. A variant of this type, silver maple‚ÄìAmerican elm‚Äìpin oak‚Äìsweetgum, is found along major streams in southern Illinois and Indiana. Pin oak also occurs in black ash‚ÄìAmerican elm‚Äìred maple forests in poorly drained bottom lands in northern Ohio and Indiana along with silver maple (Acer saccharinum), swamp white oak, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), black tupelo, and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides). Bark Reaction to competition Pin oak is classed as intolerant of shade. It is less tolerant than elm, boxelder (Acer negundo), sweetgum, hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and ash, but is more tolerant than eastern cottonwood and black willow. Pin oak usually grows in even-aged stands of dominant and co-dominant trees. Intermediate and suppressed trees in such stands usually die within a few years of being overtopped. Single pin oaks in mixed stands usually are dominants. Pin oak is considered a subclimax species. It persists on heavy, wet soils because it produces an abundance of acorns which, if released, grow faster on these sites than most of its competitors. Pin oaks are also classified as allelopathic, meaning they crowd out or otherwise successfully compete with understory vegetation to survive. Damaging agents Although pin oak is very tolerant of dormant-season flooding, it is much less tolerant of growing-season flooding. Trees may be injured or killed by intermittent growing-season flooding over several successive years. The trees can usually survive one growing season of continuous flooding, but will be killed by continuous flooding over 2 or 3 consecutive years. Pin oak is rated as \\"intermediately tolerant\\" to growing-season flooding. Also, since the bark of pin oak is relatively thin, the species is especially susceptible to damage by fire and decay associated with fire wounds. Typical autumn foliage Uses In its native range, pin oak is the most commonly used landscaping oak along with northern red oak due to its ease of transplant, relatively fast growth, and pollution tolerance. However, as it is naturally adapted to moist, acidic soils, it may develop a condition known as iron chlorosis on less suitable locations, causing the tree to shed leaves during the growing season and rot from the top down. Mature pin oaks are often too big to treat and this nutrient deficiency on alkaline soil may eventually kill them. The drooping lower branches can also be a problem, interfering with access for traffic and pedestrians. It is also cultivated in parks and large gardens in the United Kingdom, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Largest known pin oak in New England, located in Northampton, MA. 2005 measurements: Height 107.9 ft, circumference 17.4 ft, average spread 96 ft The wood is generally marketed as red oak, but is of significantly inferior quality, being somewhat weaker, often with many small knots. The wood is hard and heavy and is used in general construction and for firewood. The bark was used by some Native American tribes to make a drink for treatment of intestinal pain. The name \\"pin oak\\" is possibly due to the many small, slender twigs, but may also be from the historical use of the hard wood for pins in wooden building construction.Harlow, W. M. (1942). Trees of the Eastern and Central United States and Canada. The pin oak is the only known food plant of Bucculatrix domicola caterpillars. Associated species Due to similarity in leaf shape, the pin oak is often confused with scarlet oak and black oak, and occasionally, red oak. However, it can be distinguished by its distinctive dead branches on the lower trunk (\\"pins\\"), and its uniquely shaped crown. The sinuses on pin oak leaves are also deeply cut, often covering just as much area as the leaf itself.

It was founded in 1101 by the itinerant preacher Robert of Arbrissel. The foundation flourished and became the center of a new monastic Order, the Order of Fontevrault. This order was composed of double monasteries, in which the community consisted of both men and women‚Äîin separate quarters of the abbey‚Äîall of which were subject to the authority of the Abbess of Fontevraud. The Abbey of Fontevraud itself consisted of four separate communities, all completely managed by the same abbess. The first permanent structures were built between 1110 and 1119.Melot (1971) The area where the Abbey is located was then part of what is sometimes referred to as the Angevin Empire. The King of England, Henry II, his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and son, King Richard the Lionheart were all buried here at the end of the 12th century. It was disestablished as a monastery during the French Revolution. The Abbey is situated in the Loire Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, between Chalonnes-sur-Loire and Sully-sur-Loire within the Loire-Anjou-Touraine French regional natural park (Parc naturel r√©gional Loire-Anjou-Touraine). The complex of monastic buildings served as a prison from 1804 to 1963. Since 1975, it has hosted a cultural centre, the Centre Culturel de l'Ouest. History =Founder= Abbey of La Ro√´ Map of the Abbey. Robert of Arbrissel had served as the Archpriest of the Diocese of Rennes, carrying out the reformist agenda of its bishop. When the bishop died in 1095, Robert was driven out of the diocese due to the hostility of the local clergy. He then became a hermit in the forest of Craon, where he practiced a life of severe penance, together with a number of other men who went on to found major monastic institutions. His eloquence and asceticism attracted many followers, for whom in 1096 he founded a monastery of canons regular at La Ro√´, of which he was the first abbot. In that same year Pope Urban II summoned him to Angers and appointed him an apostolic missionary, authorizing him to preach anywhere. His preaching drew large crowds of devoted followers, both men and women, even lepers. As a result, many men wished to embrace the religious life, whom he sent to his abbey. When the canons of that house objected to the influx of candidates of lower social states, he resigned his office and left the community.Catholic Encyclopedia Robert of Arbissel =Fontevraud= Around 1100 Robert and his followers settled in a valley called Fons Ebraldi where he established a monastic community. Initially the men and women lived together in the same house, in an ancient ascetic practice called Syneisaktism. This practice had been widely condemned by Church authorities, however, and under pressure the community soon segregated according to gender, with the monks living in small priories where they lived in community in service to the nuns and under their rule. They were recognized as a religious community in 1106, both by the Bishop of Angers and by Pope Paschal II. Robert, who soon resumed his life of itinerant preaching, appointed Hersende of Champagn√© to lead the community. Later her assistant, Petronilla of Chemill√©, was elected as the first abbess in 1115. Robert wrote a brief Rule of Life for the community, based upon the Rule of St. Benedict. Unlike the other monastic orders characterized by double monasteries, the monks and nuns of the Order of Fontevrault followed the same Rule. In his Rule, Robert dealt with four principal points: silence, good works, food and clothing, encouraging the utmost in simplicity of life and dress. He directed that the abbess should never be chosen from among those who had been brought up at Fontevrault, but that she should be someone who had had experience of the world (de conversis sororibus). This latter injunction was observed only in the case of the first two abbesses and was canceled by Pope Innocent III in 1201. At the time of Robert's death in 1117, there were about 3,000 nuns in the community. In the early years the Plantagenets were great benefactors of the abbey and while Isabella d'Anjou was the abbess, King Henry II's widow, Eleanor of Aquitaine, made the abbey her place of residence. Abbess Louise de Bourbon left her crest on many of the alterations to the abbey building which she made during her term of office. Tomb of Richard I of England (front) and Isabella of Angoul√™me (back) =Decline= With the passing of the Plantagenet dynasty, Fontevrault and her dependencies began to fall upon hard times. At the end of the 12th century, the Abbess of Fontevrault, Matilda of Flanders (1189-1194), complained about the extreme poverty which the abbey was suffering. As a result, in 1247 the nuns were permitted to receive inheritances to provide income for their needs, contrary to monastic custom. The fragile economic basis of the Order was exacerbated by the devastation of the Hundred Years War, which lasted throughout the 14th century. A canonical visitation of fifty of the priories of the Order in 1460 showed most of them to be barely occupied, if not abandoned. =Suppression and later history= The Order was dispersed during the French Revolution. In November 1789, all property of the Catholic Church was declared to be the property of the nation. On 17 August 1792, a Revolutionary decree ordered evacuation of all monasteries, to be completed by 1 October 1792. At that time, there were still some 200 nuns and a small community of monks in residence at Fontevraud. The last abbess, Julie Sophie Charlotte de Pardaillan d'Antin, is said to have died in poverty in Paris in 1797. The abbey became a prison in 1804. The prison was planned to hold 1,000 prisoners and the former abbey required major changes, including new barracks in addition to the transformation of monastic buildings into dormitories, workshops, and common areas. Prisoners‚Äîmen, women and children‚Äîbegan arriving in 1814. Eventually it held some 2,000 prisoners, earning the prison the reputation of being the \\"toughest in France after Clairvaux\\" (also a former abbey). Political prisoners were subjected to the harshest conditions. Under the Vichy Government, some French Resistance prisoners were shot there. In 1963 it was given to the French Ministry of Culture, and a major restoration was undertaken. In 1975 the Centre culturel de l'Ouest was formed to preserve the abbey and promote it as a cultural venue. The complex was opened to the public in 1985. Restoration of the abbey church according to the earlier restoration under the architect Lucien Magne was completed in 2006. The order was revived by Mme Rose in 1806 as one for women only and following a modified rule.Cross, F. L., ed. (1957) The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.

Early history A gif-based example of limited animation. Note that only the mouth, eyes and arms are moving; the remainder of the image is relatively static.The use of budget- cutting and time-saving animation measures in animation dates back to the earliest commercial animation, including cycled animations, mirror-image and symmetrical drawings, still characters, and other labor-saving methods. In general, the progression was from early productions in which every frame was drawn by hand, independent of each other drawing, toward more limited animation that made use of the same drawings in different ways. Winsor McCay, a man who put an unprecedented amount of detail into his animations, boasted that in his 1914 film, Gertie the Dinosaur, that everything moved, including the rocks and blades of grass in the background. In contrast, his 1918 film The Sinking of the Lusitania progressed to using cels over still backgrounds, while still maintaining a level of detail comparable to that of Gertie. The 1942 Merrie Melodies short The Dover Boys is one of the earliest Warner Bros. cartoons to extensively employ some of the processes of what would become known as \\"limited animation,\\" particularly its use of characters that either stand still or move so quickly that the actual motion appears to be a blur.Chuck Jones: Extremes and In-betweens - A Life in Animation (PBS 2000) American television Hanna-Barbera Productions used limited animation throughout its existence. When the company's namesakes, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, separated from the MGM studio in 1957, they opted to take a drastically different approach to animation than they had for their fully animated film shorts; as television screens were much smaller than theater screens at the time, limited animation, with its emphasis on character close- ups and dialogue-based humor, was a better fit for the more intimate home viewer experience. The financial benefits of limited animation led to television animation companies relying on the process extensively in the television era. Jay Ward Productions relied on limited animation for those reasons, compensating with its heavy Cold War satire and a style of deadpan comedy that would become a trademark of the studio's style. One of the frequent users of limited animation was HB's Saturday-morning rival Filmation (makers of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and BraveStarr) which gave their work a distinct look.Filmation Associates Studio DirectoryBCDB Bill Mel√©ndez used a form of limited animation to adapt the Peanuts franchise to television and later film; in addition to the cost and time concerns (especially for his first special A Charlie Brown Christmas, which was given only a $76,000 budget and four months to produce 30 minutes of animation), Mel√©ndez also noted that Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz had designed the characters with a flat style well-suited for limited animation. The short- lived Cambria Studios turned out three serials using one of the most inexpensive approaches to animation possible: known as Syncro-Vox, it involved superimposing film of the voice actor's moving lips over a still frame of the character.\\"Don't believe your eyes! How 'Clutch Cargo' cuts corners as a television comic strip\\", TV Guide, December 24, 1960, pp. 28-29. By the 1970s, the usage of limited animation in Saturday morning cartoons had become an epidemic; Walter Williams, creator of The Mr. Bill Show, noted that cartoons in the 1970s were so static, he expected the artist's hands to enter the screen at any moment and physically start moving the drawings around. This inspired him to create the \\"Mr. Hands\\" character in The Mr. Bill Show, who literally did just that. Japanese television Limited animation proved to be particularly popular in Japan, such that the Japanese word for animation, anime, entered the English lexicon as a loanword for the distinctive, low- frame rate style of limited animation that took root there.Anime's Great Deception-The Difference Between Anime and Cartoons Anime features scenes of mouth moving with occasional eye blinks, rendered long shots of detailed backgrounds and rare use of 2D fluidity on motion-blur filled action alongside reused drawings. It also has the benefit of lower cost productions and stylized content as opposed to realistic animation.Is Anime a Legitimate Form of Animation?-Animator IslandAnimation Styles: What Make Anime Unique-Show Me The Animation.com As was the case in the United States, television was a major impetus for the growth of anime in Japan; the country's recovery from World War II led to economic prosperity and a boom in Japanese television ownership, and the development of anime allowed Japan to compete in an animation field where they had previously lagged well behind the West.

Life and career Varela was born in 1946 in Santiago in Chile, the son of Corina Mar√≠a Elena Garc√≠a Tapia and Ra√∫l Andr√©s Varela Rodr√≠guez. After completing secondary school at the Liceo Alem√°n del Verbo Divino in Santiago (1951‚Äì1963), like his mentor Humberto Maturana, Varela temporarily studied medicine at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and graduated with a degree in biology from the University of Chile. He later obtained a Ph.D. in biology at Harvard University. His thesis, defended in 1970 and supervised by Torsten Wiesel, was titled Insect Retinas: Information processing in the compound eye. After the 1973 military coup led by Augusto Pinochet, Varela and his family spent 7 years in exile in the United States before he returned to Chile to become a professor of biology at the Universidad de Chile. Varela became familiar, by practice, with Tibetan Buddhism in the 1970s, initially studying, together with Keun-Tshen Goba (n√© Ezequiel Hernandez Urdaneta), with the meditation master Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, founder of Vajradhatu and Shambhala Training, and later with Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a Nepalese meditation master of higher tantras. In 1986, he settled in France, where he first taught cognitive science and epistemology at the √âcole Polytechnique, and later neuroscience at the University of Paris. From 1988 until his death, he led a research group, as Director of Research at the CNRS (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique). In 1987, Varela, along with R. Adam Engle, founded the Mind and Life Institute, initially to sponsor a series of dialogues between scientists and the Dalai Lama about the relationship between modern science and Buddhism. The Institute continues today as a major nexus for such dialog as well as promoting and supporting multidisciplinary scientific investigation in mind sciences, contemplative scholarship and practice and related areas in the interface of science with meditation and other contemplative practices, especially Buddhist practices. Varela died in 2001 in Paris of Hepatitis C after having written an account of his 1998 liver transplant.\\"Intimate Distances - Fragments for a Phenomenology of Organ Transplantation\\" Varela had four children, including the actress, environmental spokesperson, and model Leonor Varela. Work and legacy Varela was trained as a biologist, mathematician and philosopher through the influence of different teachers, Humberto Maturana and Torsten Wiesel. He wrote and edited a number of books and numerous journal articles in biology, neurology, cognitive science, mathematics, and philosophy. He founded, with others, the Integral Institute, a thinktank dedicated to the cross-fertilization of ideas and disciplines. Varela supported embodied philosophy, viewing human cognition and consciousness in terms of the enactive structures in which they arise. These comprise the body (as a biological system and as personally experienced) and the physical world which it enacts.p. 148 'This shift requires that we move away from the idea of the world as independent and extrinsic, to the idea of a world as inseparable from the structure of these processes of self- modification.' Varela, Francisco J., Thompson, Evan T., and Rosch, Eleanor. (1991). The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. Varela's work popularized within the field of neuroscience the concept of neurophenomenology. This concept combined the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, with \\"first-person science.\\" Neurophenomenology requires observers to examine their own conscious experience using scientifically verifiable methods. In the 1996 popular book The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems, physicist Fritjof Capra makes extensive reference to Varela and Maturana's theory of autopoiesis as part of a new, systems-based scientific approach for describing the interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena. Written for a general audience, The Web of Life helped popularize the work of Varela and Maturana, as well as that of Ilya Prigogine and Gregory Bateson. Varela's 1991 book The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience, co-authored with Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch, is considered a classic in the field of cognitive science, offering pioneering phenomenological connections and introducing the Buddhism- informed enactivist and embodied cognition approach. A revised edition of The Embodied Mind was published in 2017, featuring substantive introductions by the surviving authors, as well as a preface by Jon Kabat-Zinn.

He was often credited as E. A. Dupont. Early career A newspaper columnist in 1916, Dupont became a screenwriter and began directing his own crime-story scripts in 1918. After several successes in his native Germany in silent films, he worked in London and in Hollywood, California. One of his greatest successes was the silent film Variet√© (1925). This film, about an ex-trapeze artist, was noted for its innovative camerawork with highly expressive movement through space, accomplished by the expressionist cinematographer Karl Freund.Kristin Thompson.

United States Dupont's success was noticed by Carl Laemmle at Universal, who offered Dupont a lucrative contract. His first project was Love Me and the World Is Mine in the early summer of 1926, which ran well over budget ($350,000) and was not a success. Britain Dupont then headed to Britain and made the film Piccadilly (1929), a late silent, which is remembered for the central performance of the Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong. Atlantic (also 1929) is a retelling of the Titanic disaster and is seen as one of the most innovative uses of sound film technology available at the time. Dupont made several more films in Britain and a few in Germany and France. Later career After a brief return to Germany, the Jewish director emigrated to the United States in 1933, where he was assigned to several B movies and low budget \\"programmer\\" films. Unhappy with the lack of opportunities afforded him in Hollywood, Dupont became a talent agent in 1940.Hal Erickson, Rovi. Dupont returned to filmmaking when he wrote and directed The Scarf (1951). In 1952 and 1953, he wrote 23 episodes for the TV series Big Town (1950‚Äì56) and directed two of those episodes, \\"Tape Recorder\\" (19 June 1952) and \\"The Story of Jerry Baxter\\" (1 January 1953).

Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning (such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space. U.S. Congress voting patterns. The input data was a table with a row for each member of Congress, and columns for certain votes containing each member's yes/no/abstain vote. The SOM algorithm arranged these members in a two-dimensional grid placing similar members closer together. The first plot shows the grouping when the data are split into two clusters. The second plot shows average distance to neighbours: larger distances are darker. The third plot predicts Republican (red) or Democratic (blue) party membership. The other plots each overlay the resulting map with predicted values on an input dimension: red means a predicted 'yes' vote on that bill, blue means a 'no' vote. The plot was created in Synapse. This makes SOMs useful for visualization by creating low-dimensional views of high-dimensional data, akin to multidimensional scaling. The artificial neural network introduced by the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s is sometimes called a Kohonen map or network. The Kohonen net is a computationally convenient abstraction building on biological models of neural systems from the 1970s and morphogenesis models dating back to Alan Turing in the 1950s. While it is typical to consider this type of network structure as related to feedforward networks where the nodes are visualized as being attached, this type of architecture is fundamentally different in arrangement and motivation. Useful extensions include using toroidal grids where opposite edges are connected and using large numbers of nodes. It is also common to use the U-Matrix. The U-Matrix value of a particular node is the average distance between the node's weight vector and that of its closest neighbors. In a square grid, for instance, the closest 4 or 8 nodes might be considered (the Von Neumann and Moore neighborhoods, respectively), or six nodes in a hexagonal grid. Large SOMs display emergent properties. In maps consisting of thousands of nodes, it is possible to perform cluster operations on the map itself.  Structure and operations  Like most artificial neural networks, SOMs operate in two modes: training and mapping. \\"Training\\" builds the map using input examples (a competitive process, also called vector quantization), while \\"mapping\\" automatically classifies a new input vector. The visible part of a self-organizing map is the map space, which consists of components called nodes or neurons. The map space is defined beforehand, usually as a finite two-dimensional region where nodes are arranged in a regular hexagonal or rectangular grid. Each node is associated with a \\"weight\\" vector, which is a position in the input space; that is, it has the same dimension as each input vector. While nodes in the map space stay fixed, training consists in moving weight vectors toward the input data (reducing a distance metric) without spoiling the topology induced from the map space. Thus, the self-organizing map describes a mapping from a higher-dimensional input space to a lower-dimensional map space. Once trained, the map can classify a vector from the input space by finding the node with the closest (smallest distance metric) weight vector to the input space vector.  Learning algorithm  The goal of learning in the self-organizing map is to cause different parts of the network to respond similarly to certain input patterns. This is partly motivated by how visual, auditory or other sensory information is handled in separate parts of the cerebral cortex in the human brain. An illustration of the training of a self-organizing map. The blue blob is the distribution of the training data, and the small white disc is the current training datum drawn from that distribution. At first (left) the SOM nodes are arbitrarily positioned in the data space. The node (highlighted in yellow) which is nearest to the training datum is selected. It is moved towards the training datum, as (to a lesser extent) are its neighbors on the grid. After many iterations the grid tends to approximate the data distribution (right). The weights of the neurons are initialized either to small random values or sampled evenly from the subspace spanned by the two largest principal component eigenvectors. With the latter alternative, learning is much faster because the initial weights already give a good approximation of SOM weights. The network must be fed a large number of example vectors that represent, as close as possible, the kinds of vectors expected during mapping. The examples are usually administered several times as iterations. The training utilizes competitive learning. When a training example is fed to the network, its Euclidean distance to all weight vectors is computed. The neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the input is called the best matching unit (BMU). The weights of the BMU and neurons close to it in the SOM grid are adjusted towards the input vector. The magnitude of the change decreases with time and with the grid-distance from the BMU. The update formula for a neuron v with weight vector Wv(s) is :W_{v}(s + 1) = W_{v}(s) + \\\\theta(u, v, s) \\\\cdot \\\\alpha(s) \\\\cdot (D(t) - W_{v}(s)), where s is the step index, t an index into the training sample, u is the index of the BMU for the input vector D(t), Œ±(s) is a monotonically decreasing learning coefficient; Œò(u, v, s) is the neighborhood function which gives the distance between the neuron u and the neuron v in step s. Depending on the implementations, t can scan the training data set systematically (t is 0, 1, 2...T-1, then repeat, T being the training sample's size), be randomly drawn from the data set (bootstrap sampling), or implement some other sampling method (such as jackknifing). The neighborhood function Œò(u, v, s) (also called function of lateral interaction) depends on the grid-distance between the BMU (neuron u) and neuron v. In the simplest form, it is 1 for all neurons close enough to BMU and 0 for others, but the Gaussian and mexican-hat functions are common choices, too. Regardless of the functional form, the neighborhood function shrinks with time. At the beginning when the neighborhood is broad, the self-organizing takes place on the global scale. When the neighborhood has shrunk to just a couple of neurons, the weights are converging to local estimates. In some implementations, the learning coefficient Œ± and the neighborhood function Œò decrease steadily with increasing s, in others (in particular those where t scans the training data set) they decrease in step-wise fashion, once every T steps. Training process of SOM on two-dimensional data set This process is repeated for each input vector for a (usually large) number of cycles Œª. The network winds up associating output nodes with groups or patterns in the input data set. If these patterns can be named, the names can be attached to the associated nodes in the trained net. During mapping, there will be one single winning neuron: the neuron whose weight vector lies closest to the input vector. This can be simply determined by calculating the Euclidean distance between input vector and weight vector. While representing input data as vectors has been emphasized in this article, any kind of object which can be represented digitally, which has an appropriate distance measure associated with it, and in which the necessary operations for training are possible can be used to construct a self-organizing map. This includes matrices, continuous functions or even other self-organizing maps. = Variables = These are the variables needed, with vectors in bold, * s is the current iteration * \\\\lambda is the iteration limit * t is the index of the target input data vector in the input data set \\\\mathbf{D} * {D}(t) is a target input data vector * v is the index of the node in the map * \\\\mathbf{W}_v is the current weight vector of node v * u is the index of the best matching unit (BMU) in the map * \\\\theta (u, v, s) is a restraint due to distance from BMU, usually called the neighbourhood function, and * \\\\alpha (s) is a learning restraint due to iteration progress. = Algorithm = # Randomize the node weight vectors in a map # Randomly pick an input vector {D}(t) # Traverse each node in the map ## Use the Euclidean distance formula to find the similarity between the input vector and the map's node's weight vector ## Track the node that produces the smallest distance (this node is the best matching unit, BMU) # Update the weight vectors of the nodes in the neighborhood of the BMU (including the BMU itself) by pulling them closer to the input vector ## W_{v}(s + 1) = W_{v}(s) + \\\\theta(u, v, s) \\\\cdot \\\\alpha(s) \\\\cdot (D(t) - W_{v}(s)) # Increase s and repeat from step 2 while s < \\\\lambda A variant algorithm: # Randomize the map's nodes' weight vectors # Traverse each input vector in the input data set ## Traverse each node in the map ### Use the Euclidean distance formula to find the similarity between the input vector and the map's node's weight vector ### Track the node that produces the smallest distance (this node is the best matching unit, BMU) ## Update the nodes in the neighborhood of the BMU (including the BMU itself) by pulling them closer to the input vector ### W_{v}(s + 1) = W_{v}(s) + \\\\theta(u, v, s) \\\\cdot \\\\alpha(s) \\\\cdot (D(t) - W_{v}(s)) # Increase s and repeat from step 2 while s < \\\\lambda =SOM Initialization= Selection of a good initial approximation is a well-known problem for all iterative methods of learning neural networks. KohonenT. Kohonen, Self-Organization and Associative Memory. Springer, Berlin, 1984. used random initiation of SOM weights. Recently, principal component initialization, in which initial map weights are chosen from the space of the first principal components, has become popular due to the exact reproducibility of the results.A. Ciampi, Y. Lechevallier, Clustering large, multi-level data sets: An approach based on Kohonen self organizing maps, in D.A. Zighed, J. Komorowski, J. Zytkow (Eds.), PKDD 2000, Springer LNCS (LNAI), vol. 1910, pp. 353-358, 2000. Careful comparison of the random initiation approach to principal component initialization for one-dimensional SOM (models of principal curves) demonstrated that the advantages of principal component SOM initialization are not universal. The best initialization method depends on the geometry of the specific dataset. Principal component initialization is preferable (in dimension one) if the principal curve approximating the dataset can be univalently and linearly projected on the first principal component (quasilinear sets). For nonlinear datasets, however, random initiation performs better. Examples =Fisher's Iris Flower Data= Consider an array of nodes, each of which contains a weight vector and is aware of its location in the array. Each weight vector is of the same dimension as the node's input vector. The weights may initially be set to random values. Now we need input to feed the map. Colors can be represented by their red, green, and blue components. Consequently, we will represent colors as vectors in the unit cube of the free vector space over generated by the basis: :R = <255, 0, 0> :G = <0, 255, 0> :B = <0, 0, 255> The diagram shown Self organizing maps (SOM) of three and eight colors with U-Matrix. compares the results of training on the data setsThese data sets are not normalized. Normalization would be necessary to train the SOM. :threeColors = [255, 0, 0], [0, 255, 0], [0, 0, 255] :eightColors = [0, 0, 0], [255, 0, 0], [0, 255, 0], [0, 0, 255], [255, 255, 0], [0, 255, 255], [255, 0, 255], [255, 255, 255] and the original images. Note the striking resemblance between the two. Similarly, after training a grid of neurons for 250 iterations with a learning rate of 0.1 on Fisher's Iris, the map can already detect the main differences between species.

SOM is a red broken line with squares, 20 nodes. The first principal component is presented by a blue line. Data points are the small grey circles. For PCA, the fraction of variance unexplained in this example is 23.23%, for SOM it is 6.86%.Illustration is prepared using free software: Mirkes, Evgeny M.; Principal Component Analysis and Self-Organizing Maps: applet, University of Leicester, 2011 There are two ways to interpret a SOM. Because in the training phase weights of the whole neighborhood are moved in the same direction, similar items tend to excite adjacent neurons. Therefore, SOM forms a semantic map where similar samples are mapped close together and dissimilar ones apart. This may be visualized by a U-Matrix (Euclidean distance between weight vectors of neighboring cells) of the SOM.Ultsch, Alfred (2003); U*-Matrix: A tool to visualize clusters in high dimensional data, Department of Computer Science, University of Marburg, Technical Report Nr. 36:1-12Saadatdoost, Robab, Alex Tze Hiang Sim, and Jafarkarimi, Hosein. \\"Application of self organizing map for knowledge discovery based in higher education data.\\" Research and Innovation in Information Systems (ICRIIS), 2011 International Conference on. IEEE, 2011. The other way is to think of neuronal weights as pointers to the input space. They form a discrete approximation of the distribution of training samples. More neurons point to regions with high training sample concentration and fewer where the samples are scarce. SOM may be considered a nonlinear generalization of Principal components analysis (PCA).Yin, Hujun; Learning Nonlinear Principal Manifolds by Self-Organising Maps, in Gorban, Alexander N.; K√©gl, Bal√°zs; Wunsch, Donald C.; and Zinovyev, Andrei (Eds.); Principal Manifolds for Data Visualization and Dimension Reduction, Lecture Notes in Computer Science and Engineering (LNCSE), vol. 58, Berlin, Germany: Springer, 2008, It has been shown, using both artificial and real geophysical data, that SOM has many advantages over the conventional feature extraction methods such as Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) or PCA. Originally, SOM was not formulated as a solution to an optimisation problem. Nevertheless, there have been several attempts to modify the definition of SOM and to formulate an optimisation problem which gives similar results.Heskes, Tom; Energy Functions for Self-Organizing Maps, in Oja, Erkki; and Kaski, Samuel (Eds.), Kohonen Maps, Elsevier, 1999 For example, Elastic maps use the mechanical metaphor of elasticity to approximate principal manifolds:Gorban, Alexander N.; K√©gl, Bal√°zs; Wunsch, Donald C.; and Zinovyev, Andrei (Eds.); Principal Manifolds for Data Visualization and Dimension Reduction, Lecture Notes in Computer Science and Engineering (LNCSE), vol. 58, Berlin, Germany: Springer, 2008, the analogy is an elastic membrane and plate.  Alternatives  * The generative topographic map (GTM) is a potential alternative to SOMs. In the sense that a GTM explicitly requires a smooth and continuous mapping from the input space to the map space, it is topology preserving. However, in a practical sense, this measure of topological preservation is lacking. * The time adaptive self-organizing map (TASOM) network is an extension of the basic SOM. The TASOM employs adaptive learning rates and neighborhood functions. It also includes a scaling parameter to make the network invariant to scaling, translation and rotation of the input space. The TASOM and its variants have been used in several applications including adaptive clustering, multilevel thresholding, input space approximation, and active contour modeling. Moreover, a Binary Tree TASOM or BTASOM, resembling a binary natural tree having nodes composed of TASOM networks has been proposed where the number of its levels and the number of its nodes are adaptive with its environment. * The growing self-organizing map (GSOM) is a growing variant of the self-organizing map. The GSOM was developed to address the issue of identifying a suitable map size in the SOM. It starts with a minimal number of nodes (usually four) and grows new nodes on the boundary based on a heuristic. By using a value called the spread factor, the data analyst has the ability to control the growth of the GSOM. * The elastic maps approachA. N. Gorban, A. Zinovyev, Principal manifolds and graphs in practice: from molecular biology to dynamical systems, International Journal of Neural Systems, Vol. 20, No. 3 (2010) 219‚Äì232. borrows from the spline interpolation the idea of minimization of the elastic energy. In learning, it minimizes the sum of quadratic bending and stretching energy with the least squares approximation error. * The conformal approach that uses conformal mapping to interpolate each training sample between grid nodes in a continuous surface. A one-to-one smooth mapping is possible in this approach. * The oriented and scalable map (OS-Map) generalises the neighborhood function and the winner selection. The homogeneous Gaussian neighborhood function is replaced with the matrix exponential. Thus one can specify the orientation either in the map space or in the data space. SOM has a fixed scale (=1), so that the maps \\"optimally describe the domain of observation\\". But what about a map covering the domain twice or in n-folds? This entails the conception of scaling. The OS-Map regards the scale as a statistical description of how many best-matching nodes an input has in the map.  Applications  * Project prioritization and selection Zheng, G. and Vaishnavi, V.

Until 1989, the concept of K. bicirrhis included its smaller relative Kryptopterus vitreolus (\\"ghost catfish\\"; often confused with K. minor). Its scientific name K. bicirrhis and common name glass catfish are often still used in the aquarium fish trade to refer to the actual K. vitreolus; as it seems, the larger and more aggressive true K. bicirrhis was only ever exported in insignificant numbers. In western Borneo, where K. minor and K. bicirrhis are sympatric, both species are known as lais tipis in the Malay language, but when locals want to distinguish the two, they refer to K. minor as lais limpok. In Cambodia, where it is known as trey kes prak, the Khmer people use the glass catfish as an ingredient in the fine fish condiment prahoc. Description The true K. bicirrhis is easily separated from K. vitreolus. K. bicirrhis reaches a significantly larger size, up to standard length, and most of its body is not clearly transparent (only obviously transparent around the head). The body of K. bicirrhis is mostly opaque and light greyish. When struck by light, it has an iridescence, and it turns milky white when it dies. It has two long barbels for locating food, which are as long again as the body in front of the anal fin. The dorsal fin is reduced to a tiny triangle, and the pectoral fins are longer than the head. Ecology Kryptopterus bicirrhis is found in Borneo, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and the Chao Phraya and Mekong drainage basins. This freshwater catfish inhabits large rivers with turbid water, where they typically live near the shore in fast-flowing water. It seems to prefer peaty water with a rather low temperature for its tropical range, around . It is a diurnal predator and mainly eats water bugs and occasionally smaller fishes.

Discussion Bush's use of the English language in formal and public speeches has spawned several books that document the statements. A poem entitled \\"Make the Pie Higher\\", composed entirely of Bushisms, was compiled by cartoonist Richard Thompson. Various public figures and humorists, such as Jon Stewart of The Daily Show and Garry Trudeau, creator of the comic strip Doonesbury, have popularized some more famous Bushisms. Linguist Mark Liberman of Language Log has suggested that Bush is not unusually error-prone in his speech, saying: \\"You can make any public figure sound like a boob, if you record everything he says and set hundreds of hostile observers to combing the transcripts for disfluencies, malapropisms, word formation errors and examples of non-standard pronunciation or usage... Which of us could stand up to a similar level of linguistic scrutiny?\\"Mark Liberman, \\"You say Nevada, I say Nevahda\\". January 3, 2004. Nearly a decade after George W. Bush said \\"misunderestimated\\" in a speech, Philip Hensher called the term one of his \\"most memorable additions to the language, and an incidentally expressive one: it may be that we rather needed a word for 'to underestimate by mistake'.\\" Journalist and pundit Christopher Hitchens published an essay in The Nation titled \\"Why Dubya Can't Read\\", writing: Stanford Graduate School lecturer and former Bush economic policy advisor Keith Hennessey has argued that the number of Bush's verbal gaffes is not unusual given the significant amount of time that he has spoken in public, and that Barack Obama's miscues are not as scrutinized. In Hennessey's view, Bush \\"intentionally aimed his public image at average Americans rather than at Cambridge or Upper East Side elites\\". Bush's statements were also notorious for their ability to state the opposite of what he intended, with notable examples including his remarks on the estate tax, \\"I'm not sure 80% of people get the death tax. I know this: 100% will get it if I'm the president.\\" Examples =General= * \\"I think we agree, the past is over.\\" ‚Äì Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on meeting with John McCain; May 10, 2000 * \\"They misunderestimated me.\\" Bentonville, Arkansas; November 6, 2000 * \\"I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.\\" Saginaw, Michigan, September 29, 2000, while attempting to reassure the business community that he does not support tearing down dams to protect endangered fish species. * \\"There's an old saying in Tennessee‚ÄîI know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee‚Äîthat says, 'Fool me once, shame on...shame on you.

Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in the bicameral National Congress. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.  Political Culture  = Sovereignty = With the proclamation of the first constitution in the Dominican Republic on 6 November 1844 in the city of San Cristobal, the Dominican theory of sovereignty, 'independence politics', was formed. The Dominican Republic would remain for the most part republican and representative. The constitution of San Cristobal established the legislature as superior to the other branches, the judiciary as an independent and the Executive to run the state day-to-day under the oversight of the judiciary and the legislature. The Congress of the Dominican Republic consists of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The President of the Republic was presented as an impartial public figure that would provide a source of unity to the Republic. Executive branch The Executive is charged with the daily administration of the state, subject to the oversight of the judicial and legislative branches. The President functions as the head of state, the head of government, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Dominican Armed Forces. The Dominican Cabinet is responsible for assisting the president in his duty to govern the nation and the President appoints ministers as he sees appropriate. The President and Vice President are elected on the same ticket by popular vote for a four-year term without immediate re-election. After at least one constitutional term, a person who has held the post of President before may run for this Office again, according to the last amendment made to the Constitution in 2010. Elections are held in years evenly divisible by four. The Dominican Constitution takes twenty-seven paragraphs to spell out the president's extensive powers. Among the most important are those that grant him authority over virtually all appointments and removals of public officials, and even popular elected ones; empower him to promulgate the laws passed by Congress; direct him to engage in diplomatic relations; and empower him to command, to deploy, and to make appointments in, the armed forces. The president also has vast emergency powers to suspend basic rights in times of emergency, to defer the legislature, to declare a state of siege, and to rule by decree. The 1966 Constitution provides for ministers and subcabinet ministers to assist in public administration. These officials must be Dominican citizens, at least twenty-five years of age, with full civil and political rights. The powers of the ministers are determined by law. However, the president is constitutionally responsible for the actions of his ministers. Ministers serve at the president's discretion, and function both as administrators of their ministries and as agents of presidential authority. =Military= The military consists of about 45,000 active duty personnel. Its principal mission is to defend the nation, but it serves more as an internal security force. The army, twice as large as the other services combined, consists of four infantry brigades and a combat support brigade; the air force operates three flying squadrons; and the navy maintains 30 aging vessels. The Dominican Republic's military is second in size to Cuba's in the Caribbean. The armed forces participate fully in counter-narcotics efforts. They also are active in efforts to control contraband and illegal immigration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and from the Dominican Republic to the United States and Puerto Rico. = Attorney General = See Attorney General of the Republic (Dominican Republic) The Attorney General is appointed by the President. In order to become an Attorney General, the individual must be meet the following requirements: # They must be Dominican by birth or origin and must be older than 35. # Must be able to exercise full political rights # Much have a bachelor's degree or higher in law # Must be a practices lawyer or a university professor of law for at least 12 years, or have spent the same amount of time as a representative of the Public Ministry or as a judge within the Judicial Power. The current Attorney General of the Dominican Republic is Jean Alain Rodriguez Sanchez, appointed by president Danilo Medina. Legislative branch Legislative power is exercised by a bicameral National Congress (Congreso de la Rep√∫blica). The upper house is the Senate (Senado) with 32 members, elected for a four-year term in single-seat constituencies. The lower house is the Chamber of Deputies (C√°mara de Diputados) with 178 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in accordance to each province, as follows: one deputy is elected for every 50,000 inhabitants plus fraction exceeding 25,000, but never less than two. Among the attributions of the Senate are the following: *Studying and approving laws. *To appoint the President and other members of the Central Electoral Board and their deputies. *To appoint the members of the Public Accounts Chamber. *To approve or not the appointment of diplomatic agents made by the Executive. *To decide on the claims of the Chamber of Deputies against public officers for misconduct or serious faults in the performance of their duties. *In the event of public accusation, the Senate may only impose the sanction of removal from office. However, the removed officer may be subject to being tried according to the respective statutes, if applicable. For the removal of office, a vote of at least ¬æ of all members of the Senate is required. Congressional and municipal elections are held separately from the presidential elections. Re-election is always possible, without any limitation. The office of Senator and Deputy are incompatible with any other position or employment at the Public Administration. Judicial branch  The Judicial Power is charged of administering justice in order to ensure the respect, protection and supervision of rights recognized under the Constitution and laws. Its higher organ is the Supreme Court of Justice, which is composed of 16 judges appointed by the National Council of Magistrates, an entity created by the constitutional reform of 1994 to ensure the independence of the Judicial Branch. The National Council of Magistrates is nominated by the three major political parties. It is presided by the President of the Republic and has the following members: *The President of the Senate, and a Senator chosen by the Senate from a different party than the President of the Senate. *The President of the Chamber of Deputies, and a Deputy chosen by the Chamber of Deputies from a different party than the President of the Chamber of Deputies. *The current President of the Supreme Court of Justice. * A judge of the Supreme Court of Justice chosen by this court, which serves as Secretary. The Supreme Court hears appeals from lower courts (as a Court of Cassation) and chooses members of lower courts. It has sole jurisdiction over actions against the President, designated members of his cabinet, and members of Congress. It has administrative and financial autonomy. Apart from working as an appeals court for all judgments rendered by judicial courts, the Supreme Court supervises all judges in the Dominican territory. Its judicial and administrative functions may be summarized as follows: *To decide on appeals as statutorily established. *To decide as last instance on the matters that are under the jurisdiction of Appeals Courts as court of first instance. *To decide as only instance on the criminal cases against the President and Vice- president of the Republic, Senators, Deputies, Ministers, Vice-ministers, Supreme Court Judges, Public General Attorney, Judges and General Attorneys of Appeals Courts, State attorneys of the Land Courts and Judges of Administrative Courts. *To decide as only instance on the constitutionality of laws, at the request of the Executive Power, one of the Presidents of the legislative chambers or an interested party. *To appoint the judges of the Appeals court, the Land courts, the Courts of First Instance, the Judges of Instruction, the Peace Courts and their deputies, the Administrative-Tax Court and the judges of any other judicial courts created by law, according to the provisions of the Law on Judicial Career. *To exercise the highest disciplinary authority on all members of the Judicial Power, being able to impose sanctions such as suspension, removal or prison. *To transfer provisionally or definitively from one jurisdiction to another, as it may deem necessary, the judges of the Appeals Court, the judges of First Instance of the Land Courts, the Judges of Instruction, the Peace Judges and other court judges created by law. *To create the administrative positions that may be necessary to comply with the attributions granted by the Constitution and laws. *To appoint all officers and employees of the Judicial Power. *To determine the wages and other payments of Judges and administrative personnel belonging to the Judicial Power. Municipal government and administrative divisions Each of the 31 provinces is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. People-elected mayors and municipal councils administer the National District (Santo Domingo) and the 103 municipal districts. The Dominican Republic has 31 provinces (provincias) and one National District* (Distrito Nacional): Azua, Baoruco, Barahona, Dajab√≥n, Duarte, El Seibo, El√≠as Pi√±a, Espaillat, Hato Mayor, Independencia, La Altagracia, La Romana, La Vega, Mar√≠a Trinidad S√°nchez, Monse√±or Nouel, Monte Cristi, Monte Plata, Pedernales, Peravia, Puerto Plata, Hermanas Mirabal, Saman√°, S√°nchez Ram√≠rez, San Crist√≥bal, San Jos√© de Ocoa, San Juan, San Pedro de Macor√≠s, Santiago, Santiago Rodr√≠guez, Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional, and Valverde. Recent political history The Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system with national elections every four years. In two rounds of presidential elections in 1996, nearly 80% of eligible Dominican voters went to the polls. The leading parties in 1994 were the PRSC, linked to the International Christian Democratic political movement, whose candidate was President Joaqu√≠n Balaguer; the PRD, affiliated with the Socialist International, whose candidate was Jos√© Francisco Pe√±a G√≥mez; and the PLD, whose candidate was former President Juan Bosch. In the 1994 elections, international observers noted many irregularities in the voter lists, and the opposition PRD immediately charged the Central Electoral Board and the PRSC with fraud. A Verification Commission appointed by the Central Electoral Board, however, did not accept the PRD's charges. By all estimates, total disenfranchised voters far exceeded the 22,281-vote margin of victory in favor of President Balaguer on 2 August 1994. Following an intense period of political activity, the competing political parties signed a Pact for Democracy on 10 August, reducing President Balaguer's term of office from 4 to 2 years, setting early elections, and reforming the constitution. A new Central Electoral Board was named to work on electoral reform. The main candidates in 1996 were Vice President Jacinto Peynado (PRSC), Jos√© Francisco Pe√±a G√≥mez (PRD), and Leonel Fern√°ndez (PLD). Domestic and international observers saw the 1996 election as transparent and fair. After the first round in which Jacinto Peynado (PRSC) was eliminated, the PRSC with Joaqu√≠n Balaguer endorsed Leonel Fern√°ndez (PLD). Results in the second round, 45 days later on 30 June, were tabulated quickly, and although the victory margin was narrow (1.5%), it was never questioned. The transition from incumbent administration to incoming administration was smooth and ushered in a new, modern era in Dominican political life. Fern√°ndez' political agenda was one of economic and judicial reform. He helped enhance Dominican participation in hemispheric affairs, such as the Organization of American States and the follow-up to the Miami Summit. On 16 May 2000, Hip√≥lito Mej√≠a, the Revolutionary Democratic Party candidate, was elected president in another free and fair election. He defeated Dominican Liberation Party candidate Danilo Medina 49.8% to 24.84%. Former President Balaguer garnered 24.68% of the vote. Mejia entered office on 16 August with four priorities: education reform, economic development, increased agricultural production, and poverty alleviation. Mej√≠a also champions the cause of Central American and Caribbean economic integration and migration, particularly as it relates to Haiti. On 16 May 2004, Leonel Fern√°ndez, running for the Dominican Liberation Party, garnered about 57% of the vote. On 16 May 2008, Leonel Fern√°ndez, running for the Dominican Liberation Party, garnered about 54% of the vote for a second consecutive term in office. In 2012, Danilo Medina narrowly won election as president against Hip√≥lito Mej√≠a. An accord with former president Fernandez, ratified by the broad PLD leadership, called for a change in the constitution to allow a second consecutive term as president, but with Leonel Fernandez installed as the head of the PLD pending his turn as candidate for the presidency in 2020. The constitution was changed, and Medina won reelection by a wide margin against Luis Abinader of the Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM). Mej√≠aIn the runup to the 2020 presidential elections, supporters of President Medina pushed for an additional change to the country's constitution to permit a third term. While Medina himself publicly remained uncommitted to another term, a fierce struggle within the PLD ensued. Following demonstrations outside the congress led by Leonel Fernandez himself, and subsequently pressure from the United States (notably through a public readout of a call from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo), president Medina announced on July 22, 2019, that he would not run again, calling instead for \\"new blood\\" (i.e., not supporting ex-president Fernandez). Medina supports former Minister of Public Works Gonzalo Castillo against Fernandez in primaries for the PLD nomination scheduled for October 6. Within the PRM, Abinader is being challenged for the nomination by ex- president Mej√≠a. Elections and Political Parties = Political Parties =  Dominican Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Dominicano, PRD)  The Dominican Revolutionary Party was founded mainly by Juan Bosch, Juan Isidro Jimenes Grull√≥n, and Rafael Mainardi Reyna, among other Trujillo-era exiles on January 21, 1939, in Havana, Cuba. After Trujillo's death, Juan Bosch, running on behalf of the PRD in 1963, became the first democratically elected official in the country's history. The party has won the presidency four times since its founding, having won in 1963, 1978, 1982, and in the 2000 elections. The PRD currently holds one seat in the senate, 57 of 155 mayors, and 16 of the 190 seats in the chamber of deputies. The PRD's main ideology is centre, with certain factions of the party being centre-left and centre-right, although the party has been considered more conservative than the PRD in recent years. The current party leader, who is also the current minister of the department of the interior, is Miguel Vargas Maldonado. The general secretary of the party is Tony Pe√±a Guaba. The Dominican Revolutionary party colors are light blue and white.  Dominican Liberation Party (Partido de la Liberaci√≥n Dominicana, PLD)  The Dominican Liberation Party is the current governing party of the Dominican Republic. The PLD was founded by former president Juan Bosch in December 15, 1973. The following year, the party participated in the national elections for the first time. The party had its first national victory in 1996, with Leonel Fernandez becoming the party's first elected president and the 50th president of Dominican Republic overall. The party has been elected into office four times since its founding, having won the presidential elections in 1996, 2004, 2008, and in the 2012 elections. Currently, the PLD has 26 of 32 seats in the senate, 106 out of 155 mayors, and 106 out of 190 in the chamber of deputies. According to the Party's official website, the PLD considers itself to be primarily centre-left, rejecting populism and neoliberalism. The party states its mission to be to fight for The current party leaders are Leonel Fernandez and President Danilo Medina Sanchez. The Dominican Liberation Party has yellow and purple as its representative colours. = Elections = Presidential elections are held in the Dominican Republic every four years, on the 16 May. The candidate must gain a majority vote of at least 50% plus one to win the presidency in the first round. If none of the candidates obtains such majority, a second poll will take place 45 days later, at which the population will decide between the two candidates that had the best results during the first poll.

The Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, originally constructed in around 1600 CE was renovated in 1819‚Äì20 CE by Gian-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh The Sikh Conference of Panjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Peshawar, Kangra and Hazara. During the Akali movement, on 20 February 1921, Narain Das, the Udasi mahant (clergy) of the gurdwara at Nankana Sahib, ordered his men to fire on Akali protesters, leading to the Nankana massacre. The firing was widely condemned, and an agitation was launched until the control of this historic Janam Asthan Gurdwara was restored to the Sikhs. Again in the 1930s and 1940s the Sikhs added more buildings and more architectural design. Migration between India and Pakistan was continuous before independence. By the 1940s Western Punjab was predominantly Muslim and supported the Muslim League and Pakistan Movement.

Kabir Das (IAST: Kabƒ´r) was a 15th-century Indian mystic poet and saint, whose writings influenced Hinduism's Bhakti movement and his verses are found in Sikhism's scripture Guru Granth Sahib.Kabir Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2015)Accessed: July 27, 2015 His early life was in a Muslim family, but he was strongly influenced by his teacher, the Hindu bhakti leader Ramananda. Kabir was born in the Indian city of Varanasi. Kabir is known for being critical of both Hinduism and Islam, stating followers of both were misguided by the Vedas and Quran, and questioning their meaningless rites of initiation such as the sacred thread and circumcision respectively. During his lifetime, he was threatened by both Hindus and Muslims for his views. When he died, both Hindus and Muslims he had inspired claimed him as theirs. Kabir suggested that Truth is with the person who is on the path of righteousness, considered all creatures on earth as his own self, and who is passively detached from the affairs of the world. To know the Truth, suggested Kabir, drop the \\"I\\" or the ego. Kabir's legacy survives and continues through the Kabir panth (\\"Path of Kabir\\"), a religious community that recognises him as its founder and is one of the Sant Mat sects. Its members are known as Kabir panthis.David Lorenzen (Editors: Karine Schomer and W. H. McLeod, 1987), The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, , pages 281‚Äì302 Early life and background The years of Kabir's birth and death are unclear. Some historians favour 1398‚Äì1448 as the period Kabir lived, while others favour 1440‚Äì1518. Many legends, inconsistent in their details, exist about his birth family and early life. According to one version, Kabir was born to a Brahmin unwed mother in Varanasi, by a seedless conception and delivered through the palm of her hand, who then abandoned him in a basket floating in a pond, and baby Kabir was picked up and then raised by a Muslim family. However, modern scholarship has abandoned these legends for lack of historical evidence, and Kabir is widely accepted to have been born and brought up in a family of Muslim weavers. According to the Indologist Wendy Doniger, Kabir was born into a Muslim family and various birth legends attempt to \\"drag Kabir back over the line from Muslim to Hindu\\".Wendy Doniger, The Hindus: An Alternative History, Oxford University Press (2010), p. 462 Some scholars state that Kabir's parents may have been recent converts to Islam, they and Kabir were likely unaware of Islamic orthodox tradition, and are likely to have been following the Nath (Shiva Yogi) school of Hinduism. This view, while contested by other scholars, has been summarized by Charlotte Vaudeville as follows: Kabir is widely believed to have become one of the many disciples of the Bhakti poet-sant Swami Ramananda in Varanasi, known for devotional Vaishnavism with a strong bent to monist Advaita philosophy teaching that God was inside every person, everything. Early texts about his life place him with Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism as well as the Sufi tradition of Islam. According to Irfan Habib, the two manuscript versions of the Persian text Dabistan-i-Mazahib are the earliest known texts with biographical information about Kabir. The Dabistan- i-Mazahib states Kabir is a \\"Bairagi\\" (Vaishnava yogi) and states he is a disciple of Ramanand (the text refers to him repeatedly as \\"Gang\\"). In addition, it states that Kabir is a monotheist and his God is \\"Rama\\". Some legends assert that Kabir never married and led a celibate's life. Most scholars conclude from historical literature that this legend is also untrue, that Kabir was likely married, his wife probably was named Dhania, they had at least one son named Kamal and a daughter named Kamali. Kabir's family is believed to have lived in the locality of Kabir Chaura in Varanasi. Kabƒ´r ma·π≠ha (), a ma·π≠ha located in the back alleys of Kabir Chaura, celebrates his life and times. Accompanying the property is a house named Nƒ´r≈´·π≠ƒ´lƒÅ () which houses Niru and Nima graves. Poetry 130px Kabir's poems were in vernacular Hindi, borrowing from various dialects including Braj. They cover various aspects of life and call for a loving devotion for God. Kabir composed his verses with simple Hindi words. Most of his work were concerned with devotion, mysticism and discipline. Kabir and his followers named his verbally composed poems of wisdom as \\"bƒÅ≈Üƒ´s\\" (utterances). These include songs and couplets, called variously dohe, ≈õalokƒÅ (Sanskrit: ≈õlokƒÅ), or sƒÅkhƒ´ (Sanskrit: sƒÅk≈üƒ´). The latter term means \\"witness\\", implying the poems to be evidence of the Truth. Literary works with compositions attributed to Kabir include Kabir Bijak, Kabir Parachai, Sakhi Granth, Adi Granth (Sikh), and Kabir Granthawali (Rajasthan). However, except for Adi Granth, significantly different versions of these texts exist and it is unclear which one is more original; for example, Kabir Bijak exists in two major recensions. The most in depth scholarly analysis of various versions and translations are credited to Charlotte Vaudeville, the 20th century French scholar on Kabir. Kabir's poems were verbally composed in the 15th century and transmitted viva voce through the 17th century. Kabir Bijak was compiled and written down for the first time in the 17th century. Scholars state that this form of transmission, over geography and across generations bred change, interpolation and corruption of the poems. Furthermore, whole songs were creatively fabricated and new couplets inserted by unknown authors and attributed to Kabir, not because of dishonesty but out of respect for him and the creative exuberance of anonymous oral tradition found in Indian literary works. Scholars have sought to establish poetry that truly came from Kabir and its historicity value. =Authenticity= Numerous poems are attributed to Kabir, but scholars now doubt the authenticity of many songs credited to him. Rabindranath Tagore's English translation and compilation One Hundred Poems of Kabir was first published in 1915, and has been a classic reprinted and widely circulated particularly in the West. Scholars believe only six of its hundred poems are authentic, and they have questioned whether Tagore introduced then prevalent theological perspectives onto Kabir, as he translated poems in early 20th century that he presumed to be of Kabir's. The unauthentic poems nevertheless belong to the Bhakti movement in medieval India, and may have been composed by admirers of Kabir who lived later. =Philosophy= Some commentators suggest Kabir's philosophy to be a syncretic synthesis of Hinduism and Islam, but scholars widely state that this is false and a misunderstanding of Kabir. He adopted their terminology and concepts, but vigorously criticized them both. He questioned the need for any holy book, as stated in Kabir Granthavali as follows: Many scholars interpret Kabir's philosophy to be questioning the need for religion, rather than attempting to propose either Hindu-Muslim unity or an independent synthesis of a new religious tradition. Kabir rejected the hypocrisy and misguided rituals evident in various religious practices of his day, including those in Islam and Hinduism. In Bijak, Kabir mocks the practice of praying to avatars such as Buddha of Buddhism, by asserting \\"don't call the master Buddha, he didn't put down devils\\". Kabir urged people to look within and consider all human beings as manifestation of God's living forms: Charlotte Vaudeville states that the philosophy of Kabir and other sants of the Bhakti movement is the seeking of the Absolute. The notion of this Absolute is nirguna which, writes Vaudeville, is same as \\"the Upanishadic concept of the Brahman-Atman and the monistic Advaita interpretation of the Vedantic tradition, which denies any distinction between the soul [within a human being] and God, and urges man to recognize within himself his true divine nature\\". Vaudeville notes that this philosophy of Kabir and other Bhakti sants is self-contradictory, because if God is within, then that would be a call to abolish all external bhakti. This inconsistency in Kabir's teaching may have been differentiating \\"union with God\\" from the concept of \\"merging into God, or Oneness in all beings\\". Alternatively, states Vaudeville, the saguna prema-bhakti (tender devotion) may have been prepositioned as the journey towards self-realization of the nirguna Brahman, a universality beyond monotheism. David N. Lorenzen and Adri√°n Mu√±oz trace these ideas of God in Kabir's philosophy as nirguna Brahman to those in Adi Shankara's theories on Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, albeit with some differences. =Influence of Islam= Lorenzen in his review of Kabir's philosophy and poetry writes, \\"the extent to which Kabir borrowed elements from Islam is controversial. Many recent scholars have argued that he simply rejected Islam and took almost all his ideas and beliefs from the Hindu tradition. Contemporary Kabir Panth sadhus make roughly the same argument. Most of the vocabulary used in his songs and verses are borrowed directly from the Hindu tradition. Nonetheless, it is hard not to see the influence of Islam in his insistence on devotion to a single God, a god Kabir most often calls Ram\\". Some scholars state that the sexual imagery in some of Kabir's poems reflect a mystic Sufi Islam influence, wherein Kabir inverts the traditional Sufi representation of a God-woman and devotee-man longing for a union, and instead uses the imagery of Lord-husband and devotee-bride. Other scholars, in contrast, state that it is unclear if Sufi ideas influenced Bhakti sants like Kabir or it was vice versa, suggesting that they probably co-developed through mutual interaction. Kabir left Islam, states Ronald McGregor, but that does not mean Kabir adopted Hindu beliefs. Kabir, nevertheless, criticized practices such as killing and eating a cow by Muslims, in a manner Hindus criticized those practices: =Persecution and social impact= Kabir's couplets suggest he was persecuted for his views, while he was alive. He stated, for example, Kabir response to persecution and slander was to welcome it. He called the slanderer a friend, expressed gratefulness for the slander, for it brought him closer to his god. Winand Callewaert translates a poem attributed to Kabir in the warrior-ascetic Dadupanthi tradition within Hinduism, as follows: The legends about Kabir describe him as the underdog who nevertheless is victorious in trials by a Sultan, a Brahmin, a Qazi, a merchant, a god or a goddess. The ideological messages in the legends appealed to the poor and oppressed. According to David Lorenzen, legends about Kabir reflect a \\"protest against social discrimination and economic exploitation\\", they present the perspective of the poor and powerless, not the rich and powerful. However, many scholars doubt that these legends of persecution are authentic, point to the lack of any corroborating evidence, consider it unlikely that a Muslim Sultan would take orders from Hindu Brahmins or Kabir's own mother demanded that the Sultan punish Kabir, and question the historicity of the legends on Kabir. Legacy Kabir literature legacy was championed by two of his disciples, BhƒÅgodƒÅs and DharmadƒÅs. Songs of Kabir were collected by Kshitimohan Sen from mendicants across India, these were then translated to English by Rabindranath Tagore. New English translations of Songs of Kabir is done by Arvind Krishna Mehrotra. August Kleinzahler writes about this: \\"It is Mehrotra who has succeeded in capturing the ferocity and improvisational energy of Kabir‚Äôs poetry\\". Kabir's legacy continues to be carried forward by the Kabir panth (\\"Path of Kabir\\"), a religious community that recognises him as its founder and is one of the Sant Mat sects. This community was founded centuries after Kabir died, in various parts of India, over the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Its members, known as Kabir panthis, are estimated to be around 9.6 million. They are spread over north and central India, as well as dispersed with the Indian diaspora across the world, up from 843,171 in the 1901 census. There are two temples dedicated to Kabir located in Benares. One of them is maintained by Hindus, while the other by Muslims. Both the temples practise similar forms of worship where his songs are sung daily. Other rituals of aarti and distributing prasad are similar to other Hindu temples. The followers of Kabir are vegetarians and abstain from alcohol. =Kabir, Guru Nanak and the Guru Granth Sahib= Kabir's verses were incorporated into Adi Granth, the scripture of Sikhism, with verses attributed to Kabir constituting the largest non-Sikh contribution.Ronald McGregor (1984), Hindi literature from its beginnings to the nineteenth century, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , page 47 Some scholars state Kabir's ideas were one of the many influencesWH McLeod (2003), Exploring Sikhism: Aspects of Sikh Identity, Culture, and Thought, Oxford University Press, , pages 19‚Äì31David Lorenzen (1981), Religious change and cultural domination, Colegio Mexico, , pages 173‚Äì191 on Guru Nanak, who went on to found Sikhism in the fifteenth century. Other Sikh scholars disagree, stating there are differences between the views and practices of Kabir and Nanak. Harpreet Singh, quoting Hew McLeod, states, \\"In its earliest stage Sikhism was clearly a movement within the Hindu tradition; Nanak was raised a Hindu and eventually belonged to the Sant tradition of northern India, a movement associated with the great poet and mystic Kabir.\\"Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies, Oxford University Press, , page 205 Surjit Singh Gandhi disagrees, and writes \\"Guru Nanak in his thought pattern as well as in action model was fundamentally different from Kabir and for that matter other radical Bhaktas or saints (saint has been erroneously used for such Bhaktas by Mcleod). Hence to consider Kabir as an influence on Guru Nanak is wrong, both historically and theologically\\". McLeod places Nanak in the Sant tradition that included Kabir, and states that their fundamental doctrines were reproduced by Nanak. JS Grewal contests this view and states that McLeod's approach is limiting in its scope because, \\"McLeod takes into account only concepts, ignores practices altogether, he concentrates on similarities and ignores all differences\\".J. S. Grewal (2010), WH McLeod and Sikh Studies, Journal of Punjab Studies, Volume 17, Issue 1‚Äì2, page 119 Kabir's poetry today There are several allusions to Kabir's poetry in mainstream Indian film music. The title song of the Sufi fusion band Indian Ocean's album Jhini is an energetic rendering of Kabir's famous poem \\"The intricately woven blanket\\", with influences from Indian folk, Sufi traditions and progressive rock. Neeraj Arya's Kabir Cafe marries Kabir's couplets with contemporary music adding elements of rock, carnatic and folk. Popular renderings include Halke Gaadi Haanko, Chadariya Jhini and Chor Awega. Kabir Cafe claims that living their lives just as Kabir suggests has led to them experiencing some of these truths and it reflects in their performances. Noted classical singer, late Kumar Gandharva, is widely recognized for his wonderful rendering of Kabir's poetry. Documentary filmmaker Shabnam Virmani, from the Kabir Project, has produced a series of documentaries and books tracing Kabir's philosophy, music and poetry in present-day India and Pakistan. The documentaries feature Indian folk singers such as Prahlad Tipanya, Mukhtiyar Ali and the Pakistani Qawwal Fareed Ayaz. Kabir festival was organized in Mumbai, India in 2017. The album No Stranger Here by Shubha Mudgal, Ursula Rucker draws heavily from Kabir's poetry. Kabir's poetry has appeared prominently in filmmaker Anand Gandhi's films Right Here Right Now (2003) and Continuum. Pakistani Sufi singer Abida Parveen has sung Kabir in a full album. Criticism Kabir has been criticised for his depiction of women. Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh states, \\"Kabir's opinion of women is contemptuous and derogatory\\". Wendy Doniger concludes Kabir had a misogynist bias. Schomer states that for Kabir, woman is \\"kali nagini (a black cobra), kunda naraka ka (the pit of hell), juthani jagata ki (the refuse of the world)\\". According to Kabir, a woman prevents man's spiritual progress. In contrast to Singh's interpretation of Kabir's gender views, Dass interprets Rag Asa section of Adi Granth as Kabir asking a young married woman to stop veiling her face, and not to adopt such social habits.Nirmal Dass (1991), Songs of Kabir from the Adi Granth, State University of New York Press, , pages 147-148 Dass adds that Kabir's poetry can be interpreted in two ways, one literally where the woman refers to human female, another allegorically where woman is symbolism for his own soul and Rama is the Lord-husband.Nirmal Dass (1991), Songs of Kabir from the Adi Granth, State University of New York Press, , pages 322-323  See also  * Surdas * KƒÅlidƒÅsa * Tulsidas * Poets of India References Further reading  Bly, Robert (2007, Original: 1977), tr.

It is a Grade I listed building. Description The remains of the 700-year-old priory stand today neighbouring a light industrial estate, and disused airfield, and lie between the villages of Colmworth and Little Staughton. Nothing survives of the priory church, and all but the refectory and kitchen of the claustral buildings have disappeared. Never a large house, the community appears to have consisted of the prior and up to four canons. The priory was founded around 1195 by William, Chaplain of Colmworth.Or 1185 by Hugh de Beauchamp according to Henry Thorold, Collins Guide to the Ruined Abbeys of England, Wales and Scotland Hugh de Beauchamp of Eaton Socon endowed the priory with 28 acres (113,000 m¬≤), the priory also held land around Coppingford chapel; during these early years it also held a considerable number of Selions, given to them by local people as gifts of faith. Around 1206 King John permitted the monks to enclose and clear part of the nearby Perry woods. After William's death in 1215, Joseph, Chaplain of Coppingford, became head of the fraternity. Under his guidance the house became an Augustinian priory. The Augustinians, were then a comparatively new order, which ordained priests, but lived in community similar in style to monks. Throughout the following years the priory prospered through gifts and grants. The monks wrote documents illustrating their daily lives, these became books of charters, called Cartularies. Unfortunately through the centuries very few of these charters have survived. It was common for monastic orders at this time to be the beneficiaries of generous donations. However, it was equally common for disapproving heirs to object to the size of these gifts donated from their potential estates. One such heir was John Pateschull, unhappy at a bequest of ¬£8 per annum in the will of his grandfather, after a dispute lasting many years, he had had the priory's cattle seized. Richard of Staughton, a senior Canon and later prior of Bushmead, called the bailiff and set out to recover them. The senior Canon was seized by John Pateschull's men and imprisoned. The dispute was finally ended through arbitration. When Richard of Staughton became prior, he obtained permission from the bishop to form a boys' school; however it is thought he died of the Black Death before the project could be implemented. The prior in 1418 was Robert Tychemerssh.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40 / 629; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H5/CP40no629/aCP40no629fronts/IMG_0291.htm; ninth entry, as defendant Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII, the ownership of Bushmead Priory became the subject of a dispute between the St. John family of Bletsoe and Sir William Gascoigne of Cardington, the latter being Cardinal Wolsey's controller of the household. He had previously exchanged land with King Henry VIII and sought further recompense. The King waited until 1537, almost a year after the priory's dissolution, before allowing the priory to pass to Sir William. Fifteen years later, in 1562, a Cambridgeshire man, William Gery, purchased the estate and almost immediately began building on the site of the priory. Around a hundred years later Richard Gery extended the site and formed a mansion (since demolished). There have obviously been many changes to the priory. A new floor, and fenestration (in the lower section) were fitted circa 1500, although only the rafters now remain. Clearly visible, though, are the major and various subsequent minor alterations, giving an interesting insight into its architectural history. It is a rare example of King post, and timber frame roof architecture.http://www.britainexpress.com/counties/bedfordshire/bushmead.htm The site is now in the care of English Heritage and is open to the public at weekends during Spring and Summer.

In Advaita Vedanta school of hindu philosophy, Maya is an illusion which makes the world appear as duality. In Hinduism, Maya is also an epithet for goddess Lakshmi, and the name of a manifestation of Lakshmi, the goddess of \\"wealth, prosperity and love\\". Also, Maya refers to wealth or treasure itself. There are many example of hidden treasures guarded by visible or invisible supernatural powers. In Buddhism, Maya is the name of Gautama Buddha's mother.

D. Shastri, The Doctrine of Maya Luzac & Co, London, page 5 and ix According to William Mahony, the root of the word may be man- or \\"to think\\", implying the role of imagination in the creation of the world. In early Vedic usage, the term implies, states Mahony, \\"the wondrous and mysterious power to turn an idea into a physical reality\\".William Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, , pages 32-33Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 1-2 Franklin Southworth states the word's origin is uncertain, and other possible roots of mƒÅyƒÅ include may- meaning mystify, confuse, intoxicate, delude, as well as mƒÅy- which means \\"disappear, be lost\\".Franklin Southworth (2012), Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia, Routledge, , page 92 Jan Gonda considers the word related to mƒÅ, which means \\"mother\\", as do Tracy PintchmanTracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, , page 30, Quote: \\"This material power is thereby readily linked to maternal creativity, a link made evident in the Sanskrit noun mƒÅ, meaning both \\"mother\\" and \\"measure\\". and Adrian Snodgrass, serving as an epithet for goddesses such as Lakshmi.Monier Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary Etymologically and Philologically Arranged, Oxford University Press, page 764 (Article on \\"‡§Æ‡§æ\\"), Quote: 4. mƒÅ, f. measure; (...) 4.2 mƒÅtƒÅ, mƒÅt·πõi, a mother; (...) a measurer in Nirukta XI, (...) a maker, former, creator, arranger, preparer (Ved.); a knower, one who infers correctly or has true knowledge; (...) the maker (of the child in the womb, jƒÅ-mƒÅt·πõi); a mother (...) mother earth (Rigveda V.42.16); (...) epithet of Lakshmi, (...) epithet of Durga (...)

These words have various meanings, with interpretations that are contested, and some are names of deities that do not appear in texts of 1st millennium BCE and later. The use of word MƒÅyƒÅ in Rig veda, in the later era context of \\"magic, illusion, power\\", occurs in many hymns. One titled MƒÅyƒÅ-bheda (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§≠‡•á‡§¶:, Discerning Illusion) includes hymns 10.177.1 through 10.177.3, as the battle unfolds between the good and the evil, as follows, The above Maya-bheda hymn discerns, using symbolic language, a contrast between mind influenced by light (sun) and magic (illusion of Asura). The hymn is a call to discern one's enemies, perceive artifice, and distinguish, using one's mind, between that which is perceived and that which is unperceived. Rig veda does not connote the word MƒÅyƒÅ as always good or always bad, it is simply a form of technique, mental power and means.Ben-Ami Scharfstein (1998), A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant, State University of New York Press, , page 376 Rig veda uses the word in two contexts, implying that there are two kinds of MƒÅyƒÅ: divine MƒÅyƒÅ and undivine MƒÅyƒÅ, the former being the foundation of truth, the latter of falsehood.Sri Aurobindo (1917, Reprinted 1998), The Secret of the Veda, Volume 15, Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, page 399, also see pages 225, 76, 89, 97, 512 Elsewhere in Vedic mythology, Indra uses Maya to conquer Vritra.Williams, George M., (2008). Handbook of Hindu Mythology, p.214. Oxford University Press. Varuna's supernatural power is called Maya. MƒÅyƒÅ, in such examples, connotes powerful magic, which both devas (gods) and asuras (demons) use against each other. In the Yajurveda, mƒÅyƒÅ is an unfathomable plan.Desai, Gandabhai Girijashanker (1967). Thinking with the Yajurveda, p.16. Asia Publishing House. In the Aitareya Brahmana Maya is also referred to as Dirghajihvi, hostile to gods and sacrifices.Agrawala, Prithvi Kumar (1984). Goddessess in Ancient India, p.121-123. Abhinav Publications, The hymns in Book 8, Chapter 10 of Atharvaveda describe the primordial woman VirƒÅj (, chief queen) and how she willingly gave the knowledge of food, plants, agriculture, husbandry, water, prayer, knowledge, strength, inspiration, concealment, charm, virtue, vice to gods, demons, men and living creatures, despite all of them making her life miserable. In hymns of 8.10.22, VirƒÅj is used by Asuras (demons) who call her as MƒÅyƒÅ, as follows, The contextual meaning of Maya in Atharvaveda is \\"power of creation\\", not illusion. Gonda suggests the central meaning of Maya in Vedic literature is, \\"wisdom and power enabling its possessor, or being able itself, to create, devise, contrive, effect, or do something\\".Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 1, and 2-17J.

An illustrative example of this in Rig veda VII.104.24 and Atharva veda VIII.4.24 where Indra is invoked against the Maya of sorcerers appearing in the illusory form ‚Äì like a fata morgana ‚Äì of animals to trick a person.Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 4 The Upanishads M. C. Escher paintings such as the Waterfall ‚Äì redrawn in this sketch ‚Äì demonstrates the Hindu concept of Maya, states Jeffrey Brodd.J Brodd, World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, 3rd Edition, Saint Mary's Press, , page 55 The impression of water-world the sketch gives, in reality is not what it seems. The Upanishads describe the universe, and the human experience, as an interplay of Purusha (the eternal, unchanging principles, consciousness) and Prak·πõti (the temporary, changing material world, nature).Paul Deussen, , pages 161, 240-254 The former manifests itself as ƒÄtman (Soul, Self), and the latter as MƒÅyƒÅ. The Upanishads refer to the knowledge of Atman as \\"true knowledge\\" (Vidya), and the knowledge of Maya as \\"not true knowledge\\" (Avidya, Nescience, lack of awareness, lack of true knowledge). Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, states Ben-Ami Scharfstein, describes Maya as \\"the tendency to imagine something where it does not exist, for example, atman with the body\\". To the Upanishads, knowledge includes empirical knowledge and spiritual knowledge, complete knowing necessarily includes understanding the hidden principles that work, the realization of the soul of things. Hendrick Vroom explains, \\"The term Maya has been translated as 'illusion,' but then it does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' does not mean that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. Maya means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned.\\"H.M. Vroom (1996), No Other Gods, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, , page 57 Lynn Foulston states, \\"The world is both real and unreal because it exists but is 'not what it appears to be'.\\" According to Wendy Doniger, \\"to say that the universe is an illusion (mƒÅyƒÅ) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. MƒÅyƒÅ not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge.\\"Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, , page 119 MƒÅyƒÅ pre-exists and co-exists with Brahman ‚Äì the Ultimate Principle, Consciousness.Archibald Edward Gough (2001), The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics, Routledge, , pages 47-48 Maya is perceived reality, one that does not reveal the hidden principles, the true reality. Maya is unconscious, Atman is conscious. Maya is the literal, Brahman is the figurative UpƒÅdƒÅna ‚Äì the principle, the cause. Maya is born, changes, evolves, dies with time, from circumstances, due to invisible principles of nature, state the Upanishads. Atman-Brahman is eternal, unchanging, invisible principle, unaffected absolute and resplendent consciousness. Maya concept in the Upanishads, states Archibald Gough, is \\"the indifferent aggregate of all the possibilities of emanatory or derived existences, pre-existing with Brahman\\", just like the possibility of a future tree pre-exists in the seed of the tree. The concept of Maya appears in numerous Upanishads. The verses 4.9 to 4.10 of Svetasvatara Upanishad, is the oldest explicit occurrence of the idea that Brahman (Supreme Soul) is the hidden reality, nature is magic, Brahman is the magician, human beings are infatuated with the magic and thus they create bondage to illusions and delusions, and for freedom and liberation one must seek true insights and correct knowledge of the principles behind the hidden magic.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 316-317 Gaudapada in his Karika on Mandukya Upanishad explains the interplay of Atman and Maya as follows,Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 618 Sarvasara Upanishad refers to two concepts: Mithya and Maya. It defines Mithya as illusion and calls it one of three kinds of substances, along with Sat (Be- ness, True) and Asat (not-Be-ness, False). Maya, Sarvasara Upanishad defines as all what is not Atman. Maya has no beginning, but has an end. Maya, declares Sarvasara, is anything that can be studied and subjected to proof and disproof, anything with Gu·πáas. In the human search for Self-knowledge, Maya is that which obscures, confuses and distracts an individual.KN Aiyar (Translator, 1914), Sarvasara Upanishad, in Thirty Minor Upanishads, page 17, The Puranas and Tamil texts Markandeya sees Vishnu as an infant on a fig leaf in the deluge In Puranas and Vaishnava theology, mƒÅyƒÅ is described as one of the nine shaktis of Vishnu.Bhattacharji, Sukumari (1970). The Indian Theogony: A Comparative Study of Indian Mythology from the Vedas to the Pura·πáas, pp. 312-345. CUP Archive. MƒÅyƒÅ became associated with sleep; and Vishnu's mƒÅyƒÅ is sleep which envelopes the world when he awakes to destroy evil. Vishnu, like Indra, is the master of mƒÅyƒÅ; and mƒÅyƒÅ envelopes Vishnu's body. The Bhagavata Purana narrates that the sage Markandeya requests Vishnu to experience his mƒÅyƒÅ. Vishnu appears as an infant floating on a fig leaf in a deluge and then swallows the sage, the sole survivor of the cosmic flood. The sage sees various worlds of the universe, gods etc. and his own hermitage in the infant's belly. Then the infant breathes out the sage, who tries to embrace the infant, but everything disappears and the sage realizes that he was in his hermitage the whole time and was given a flavor of Vishnu's mƒÅyƒÅ. The magic creative power, MƒÅyƒÅ was always a monopoly of the central Solar God; and was also associated with the early solar prototype of Vishnu in the early Aditya phase. The basic grammar of the third and final Tamil Sangam is Tholkappiyam composed by Tholkappiyar, who according to critics is referred as Rishi Jamadagni's brother Sthiranadumagni and uncle of Parshurama. He categorically uses a Prakrit (Tamil:Pagatham) Tadbhava Mayakkam, which is the root of the word Maya(m). He says that the entire creation is a blurred flow between State of matter or Pancha Bhutas. This concept of Maya is of the school of Agastya, who was the first Tamil grammarian and the guru of Tholkappiyarhttp://www.tamilvu.org/slet/l0100/l0100pd1.jsp?bookid=1&auth;_pub_id=10&pno;=635.

Maya, to Shaiva Siddhanta sub-school of Hinduism, states Hilko Schomerus, is reality and truly existent, and one that exists to \\"provide Souls with Bhuvana (a world), Bhoga (objects of enjoyment), Tanu (a body) and Karana (organs)\\".Hilko Schomerus (2000), ≈öaiva SiddhƒÅnta: An Indian School of Mystical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 118 =Schools of Hinduism= Need to understand MƒÅyƒÅ The various schools of Hinduism, particularly those based on naturalism (Vai≈õe·π£ika), rationalism (Samkhya) or ritualism (Mimamsa), questioned and debated what is Maya, and the need to understand Maya.Adi Shankara (Translator: S Vireswarananda), Commentary on Brahma-sutras, Advaita Ashrama, pages 30-37, Archive in Sanskrit, Translated in English The Vedanta and Yoga schools explained that complete realization of knowledge requires both the understanding of ignorance, doubts and errors, as well as the understanding of invisible principles, incorporeal and the eternal truths. In matters of Self- knowledge, stated Shankara in his commentary on Taittiriya Upanishad, one is faced with the question, \\"Who is it that is trying to know, and how does he attain Brahman?\\" It is absurd, states Shankara, to speak of one becoming himself; because \\"Thou Art That\\" already. Realizing and removing ignorance is a necessary step, and this can only come from understanding Maya and then looking beyond it.Adi Shankara, , SS Sastri (Translator), Harvard University Archives, pages 191-198 The need to understand Maya is like the metaphorical need for road. Only when the country to be reached is distant, states Shankara, that a road must be pointed out. It is a meaningless contradiction to assert, \\"I am right now in my village, but I need a road to reach my village.\\" It is the confusion, ignorance and illusions that need to be repealed. It is only when the knower sees nothing else but his Self that he can be fearless and permanent. Vivekananda explains the need to understand Maya as follows (abridged),S Vivekananda, , Volume 7, pages 63-65 The text Yoga Vasistha explains the need to understand Maya as follows, Samkhya school The early works of Samkhya, the rationalist school of Hinduism, do not identify or directly mention the Maya doctrine.Nakamura, Hajime (1990). A History of Early VedƒÅnta Philosophy, p.335-336. Motilal Banarsidass Publications. The discussion of Maya theory, calling it into question, appears after the theory gains ground in Vedanta school of Hinduism. VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra's commentary on the Samkhyakarika, for example, questions the Maya doctrine saying \\"It is not possible to say that the notion of the phenomenal world being real is false, for there is no evidence to contradict it\\". Samkhya school steadfastly retained its duality concept of Prakrti and Purusha, both real and distinct, with some texts equating Prakrti to be Maya that is \\"not illusion, but real\\", with three Gu·πáas in different proportions whose changing state of equilibrium defines the perceived reality.Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 4 and 167 James Ballantyne, in 1885, commented on Kapila's S√°nkhya aphorism 5.72 which he translated as, \\"everything except nature and soul is uneternal\\". According to Ballantyne, this aphorism states that the mind, ether, etc. in a state of cause (not developed into a product) are called Nature and not Intellect. He adds, that scriptural texts such as Shvetashvatara Upanishad to be stating \\"He should know Illusion to be Nature and him in whom is Illusion to be the great Lord and the world to be pervaded by portions of him'; since Soul and Nature are also made up of parts, they must be uneternal\\".Ballantyne, James Robert (1885), The S√°nkhya Aphorisms of Kapila, pp. 373-374 with footnote 6, Trubner's Oriental Series, Reprinted by Routledge (2000), However, acknowledges Ballantyne, Edward Gough translates the same verse in Shvetashvatara Upanishad differently, 'Let the sage know that Prakriti is Maya and that Mahesvara is the Mayin, or arch-illusionist. All this shifting world is filled with portions of him'.The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics Edward Gough, page 224 In continuation of the Samkhya and Upanishadic view, in the Bhagavata philosophy, Maya has been described as 'that which appears even when there is no object like silver in a shell and which does not appear in the atman'; with maya described as the power that creates, maintains and destroys the universe.Vyas, Ramnarayan.(1974). The Synthetic Philosophy of the BhƒÅgavata, p.101. Meharchand Lachhmandas. Nyaya school The realism-driven Nyaya school of Hinduism denied that either the world (Prakrti) or the soul (Purusa) are an illusion. Naiyayikas developed theories of illusion, typically using the term Mithya, and stated that illusion is simply flawed cognition, incomplete cognition or the absence of cognition. There is no deception in the reality of Prakrti or Pradhana (creative principle of matter/nature) or Purusa, only confusion or lack of comprehension or lack of cognitive effort, according to Nyaya scholars. To them, illusion has a cause, that rules of reason and proper Pramanas (epistemology) can uncover. Illusion, stated Naiyayikas, involves the projection into current cognition of predicated content from memory (a form of rushing to interpret, judge, conclude). This \\"projection illusion\\" is misplaced, and stereotypes something to be what it is not.Stephen H Phillips (2012), Epistemology in Classical India: The Knowledge Sources of the Nyaya School, Routledge, , Chapter 3 The insights on theory of illusion by Nyaya scholars were later adopted and applied by Advaita Vedanta scholars.Bina Gupta (1995), Perceiving in Advaita VedƒÅnta: Epistemological Analysis and Interpretation, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 29-38, 117-132 Yoga school Maya in Yoga school is the manifested world and implies divine force.Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 66 Yoga and Maya are two sides of the same coin, states Zimmer, because what is referred to as Maya by living beings who are enveloped by it, is Yoga for the Brahman (Universal Principle, Supreme Soul) whose yogic perfection creates the Maya.HR Zimmer (1978), Maya: der indische Mythos, Insel-Verlag, , page 62 (German), Maya is neither illusion nor denial of perceived reality to the Yoga scholars, rather Yoga is a means to perfect the \\"creative discipline of mind\\" and \\"body-mind force\\" to transform Maya.Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 65-66 The concept of Yoga as power to create Maya has been adopted as a compound word Yogamaya (‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ) by the theistic sub-schools of Hinduism. It occurs in various mythologies of the Puranas; for example, Shiva uses his yogamƒÅyƒÅ to transform Markendeya's heart in Bhagavata Purana's chapter 12.10, while Krishna counsels Arjuna about yogamƒÅyƒÅ in hymn 7.25 of Bhagavad Gita.‡§≠‡§ó‡§µ‡§¶‡•ç‡§ó‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ/‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§É, Bhagavad Gita 7.25, Wikisource (Sanskrit) Vedanta school Maya is a prominent and commonly referred to concept in Vedanta philosophies.PD Shastri, The Doctrine of Maya Luzac & Co, London, page 3S.

Schultz (1979), Judaism and the Gentile Faiths: Comparative Studies in Religion, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, , page 93 Human mind constructs a subjective experience, states Vedanta school, which leads to the peril of misunderstanding Maya as well as interpreting Maya as the only and final reality. Vedantins assert the \\"perceived world including people are not what they appear to be\\".HM Vroom (1989), Religions and the Truth: Philosophical Reflections and Perspectives, Eerdmans Publishing, , pages 122-123 There are invisible principles and laws at work, true invisible nature in others and objects, and invisible soul that one never perceives directly, but this invisible reality of Self and Soul exists, assert Vedanta scholars. MƒÅyƒÅ is that which manifests, perpetuates a sense of false duality (or divisional plurality). This manifestation is real, but it obfuscates and eludes the hidden principles and true nature of reality. Vedanta school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of these invisible principles ‚Äì the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).PD Shastri, The Doctrine of Maya Luzac & Co, London, page 58-73 The difference within various sub-schools of Vedanta is the relationship between individual soul and cosmic soul (Brahman). Non-theistic Advaita sub-school holds that both are One, everyone is thus deeply connected Oneness, there is God in everyone and everything;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, , pages 47, 99-103 while theistic Dvaita and other sub-schools hold that individual souls and God's soul are distinct and each person can at best love God constantly to get one's soul infinitely close to His Soul.James Lewis and William Travis (1999), Religious Traditions of the World, , pages 279-280Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, , pages 155-157 Advaita Vedanta In Advaita Vedanta philosophy, there are two realities: Vyavaharika (empirical reality) and Paramarthika (absolute, spiritual reality).Frederic F. Fost (1998), Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita VedƒÅnta, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1998), pages 387-405 MƒÅyƒÅ is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. MƒÅyƒÅ has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self‚Äîthe Cosmic Spirit also known as Brahman. The theory of mƒÅyƒÅ was developed by the ninth-century Advaita Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara. However, competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara's theory,Surendranath Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy. Cambridge University Press Archive, 1955, page 1. \\"He [Bhaskara] speaks in very strong terms against the commentator [Shankara] who holds the mƒÅyƒÅ doctrine and is a Buddhist in his views. But, though he was opposed to Shankara, it was only so far as Shankara had introduced the mƒÅyƒÅ doctrine, and only so far as he thought the world had sprung forth not as a real modification of Brahman, but only through mƒÅyƒÅ.\\" and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and MƒÅyƒÅ.Pratima Bowes, \\"Mysticism in the Upanishads and Shankara's Vedanta\\" in Karel Werner, ed., The Yogi and the Mystic.\\" Routledge, 1995, page 67. A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, \\"Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world.\\"Esther Abraham Solomon (1969), AvidyƒÅ: A Problem of Truth and Reality, , pages 269-270 MƒÅyƒÅ is a fact in that it is the appearance of phenomena. Since Brahman is the sole metaphysical truth, MƒÅyƒÅ is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, MƒÅyƒÅ is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Since MƒÅyƒÅ is the perceived material world, it is true in perception context, but is \\"untrue\\" in spiritual context of Brahman. MƒÅyƒÅ is not false, it only clouds the inner Self and principles that are real. True Reality includes both Vyavaharika (empirical) and Paramarthika (spiritual), the MƒÅyƒÅ and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the fearless, resplendent Oneness.Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita VedƒÅnta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86 Vivekananda said: \\"When the Hindu says the world is Maya, at once people get the idea that the world is an illusion. This interpretation has some basis, as coming through the Buddhistic philosophers, because there was one section of philosophers who did not believe in the external world at all. But the Maya of the Vedanta, in its last developed form, is neither Idealism nor Realism, nor is it a theory. It is a simple statement of facts ‚Äî what we are and what we see around us.\\" Buddhism The Early Buddhist Texts contain some references to illusion, the most well known of which is the Phe·πáapi·πá·∏ç≈´pama Sutta in Pali (and with a Chinese Agama parallel at SƒÄ 265) which states: > Suppose, monks, that a magician (mƒÅyƒÅkƒÅro) or a magician‚Äôs apprentice > (mƒÅyƒÅkƒÅrantevƒÅsƒ´) would display a magical illusion (mƒÅya·πÉ) at a crossroads. > A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder, and carefully investigate > it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), > coreless (asƒÅraka). For what core (sƒÅro) could there be in a magical > illusion (mƒÅyƒÅya)? So too, monks, whatever kind of cognition there is, > whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, > inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspects it, ponders it, and > carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), > hollow (tucchaka), coreless (asƒÅraka). For what core (sƒÅro) could there be > in cognition?Shi Huifeng. Is ‚ÄúIllusion‚Äù a Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ Creation? The Birth > and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor. Fo Guang University. Journal of > Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016 One sutra in the ƒÄgama collection known as \\"MahƒÅs≈´tras\\" of the (M≈´la)SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin tradition entitled the MƒÅyƒÅjƒÅla (Net of Illusion) deals especially with the theme of Maya. This sutra only survives in Tibetan translation and compares the five aggregates with further metaphors for illusion, including: an echo, a reflection in a mirror, a mirage, sense pleasures in a dream and a madman wandering naked. These texts give the impression that mƒÅyƒÅ refers to the insubstantial and essence-less nature of things as well as their deceptive, false and vain character. Later texts such as the Lalitavistara also contain references to illusion: The Salistamba Sutra also puts much emphasis on illusion, describing all dharmas as being ‚Äúcharacterized as illusory‚Äù and ‚Äúvain, hollow, without core‚Äù. Likewise the MahƒÅvastu, a highly influential MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikan text on the life of the Buddha, states that the Buddha ‚Äúhas shown that the aggregates are like a lightning flash, as a bubble, or as the white foam on a wave.‚Äù =Theravada= In Theravada Buddhism 'MƒÅyƒÅ' is the name of the mother of the Buddha as well as a metaphor for the consciousness aggregate (vi√±√±ana). The Theravada monk Bhikkhu Bodhi considers the Pali Phe·πáapi·πá·∏ç≈´pama Sutta ‚Äúone of the most radical discourses on the empty nature of conditioned phenomena.‚Äù Bodhi also cites the Pali commentary on this sutra, the SƒÅratthappakƒÅsinƒ´ (Spk), which states: > Cognition is like a magical illusion (mƒÅyƒÅ) in the sense that it is > insubstantial and cannot be grasped. Cognition is even more transient and > fleeting than a magical illusion. For it gives the impression that a person > comes and goes, stands and sits, with the same mind, but the mind is > different in each of these activities. Cognition deceives the multitude like > a magical illusion (mƒÅyƒÅ).Bodhi, Connected Discourses of the Buddha Vol I p. > 1087, n. 194. Likewise, Bhikkhu Katukurunde Nyanananda Thera has written an exposition of the K√†lak√†r√†ma Sutta which features the image of a magical illusion as its central metaphor.Katukurunde Nyanananda Thera. The Magic of the Mind (PDF), Buddhist Publication Society, 1974, OCLC 2999880 =Sarvastivada= The NyƒÅnƒÅnusƒÅra ≈öƒÅstra, a VaibhƒÅ·π£ika response to Vasubandhu‚Äôs Abhidharmakosha cites the MƒÅyƒÅjƒÅla sutra and explains: > ‚ÄúSeeing an illusory object (mƒÅyƒÅ)‚Äù: Although what one apprehends is unreal, > nothing more than an illusory sign. If one does not admit this much, then an > illusory sign should be non-existent. What is an illusory sign? It is the > result of illusion magic. Just as one with higher gnosis can magically > create forms, likewise this illusory sign does actually have manifestation > and shape. Being produced by illusion magic, it acts as the object of > vision. That object which is taken as really existent is in fact ultimately > non-existent. Therefore, this [MƒÅyƒÅjƒÅla] S≈´tra states that it is non- > existent, due to the illusory object there is a sign but not substantiality. > Being able to beguile and deceive one, it is known as a ‚Äúdeceiver of the > eye.‚Äù =Mahayana= In Mahayana sutras, illusion is an important theme of the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ sutras. Here, the magician's illusion exemplifies how people misunderstand and misperceive reality, which is in fact empty of any essence and cannot be grasped. The Mahayana uses similar metaphors for illusion: magic, a dream, a bubble, a rainbow, lightning, the moon reflected in water, a mirage, and a city of celestial musicians.\\" Thinley Norbe Rinpoche in The Dzogchen Primer, Marcia Binder Schmidt ed. Shambala, Boston, 2002, pg. 215 Understanding that what we experience is less substantial than we believe is intended to serve the purpose of liberation from ignorance, fear, and clinging and the attainment of enlightenment as a Buddha completely dedicated to the welfare of all beings. The Praj√±aparamita texts also state that all dharmas (phenomena) are like an illusion, not just the five aggregates, but all beings, including Bodhisattvas and even Nirvana. The Praj√±aparamita-ratnaguna- samcayagatha (Rgs) states: And also: According to Ven. Dr. Huifeng, what this means is that Bodhisattvas see through all conceptualizations and conceptions, for they are deceptive and illusory, and sever or cut off all these cognitive creations. Depending on the stage of the practitioner, the magical illusion is experienced differently. In the ordinary state, we get attached to our own mental phenomena, believing they are real, like the audience at a magic show gets attached to the illusion of a beautiful lady. At the next level, called actual relative truth, the beautiful lady appears, but the magician does not get attached. Lastly, at the ultimate level, the Buddha is not affected one way or the other by the illusion. Beyond conceptuality, the Buddha is neither attached nor non-attached.Thinley Norbe Rinpoche in The Dzogchen Primer, Marcia Binder Schmidt ed. Shambala, Boston, 2002, pg. 217 This is the middle way of Buddhism, which explicitly refutes the extremes of both eternalism and nihilism. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy discusses nirmita, or illusion closely related to mƒÅyƒÅ. In this example, the illusion is a self-awareness that is, like the magical illusion, mistaken. For Nagarjuna, the self is not the organizing command center of experience, as we might think. Actually, it is just one element combined with other factors and strung together in a sequence of causally connected moments in time. As such, the self is not substantially real, but neither can it be shown to be unreal. The continuum of moments, which we mistakenly understand to be a solid, unchanging self, still performs actions and undergoes their results. \\"As a magician creates a magical illusion by the force of magic, and the illusion produces another illusion, in the same way the agent is a magical illusion and the action done is the illusion created by another illusion.\\"Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika Prajna Nama, J.W. DeJong, Christian Lindtner (eds.) quoted in Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Jan Westerhoff, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009. p. 163 What we experience may be an illusion, but we are living inside the illusion and bear the fruits of our actions there. We undergo the experiences of the illusion. What we do affects what we experience, so it matters.Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Jan Westerhoff, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009. p. 164 In this example, Nagarjuna uses the magician's illusion to show that the self is not as real as it thinks, yet, to the extent it is inside the illusion, real enough to warrant respecting the ways of the world. For the Mahayana Buddhist, the self is mƒÅyƒÅ like a magic show and so are objects in the world. Vasubandhu's Trisvabhavanirdesa, a Mahayana Yogacara \\"Mind Only\\" text, discusses the example of the magician who makes a piece of wood appear as an elephant.The Emptiness of Emptiness: An Introduction to Early Indian Madhyamika. C.W. Huntingdon, Jr. with Geshe Namgyal Wangchen, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, 1989, , p.61-62. The audience is looking at a piece of wood but, under the spell of magic, perceives an elephant instead. Instead of believing in the reality of the illusory elephant, we are invited to recognize that multiple factors are involved in creating that perception, including our involvement in dualistic subjectivity, causes and conditions, and the ultimate beyond duality. Recognizing how these factors combine to create what we perceive ordinarily, ultimate reality appears. Perceiving that the elephant is illusory is akin to seeing through the magical illusion, which reveals the dharmadhatu, or ground of being. =Tantra= Buddhist Tantra, a further development of the Mahayana, also makes use of the magician's illusion example in yet another way. In the completion stage of Buddhist Tantra, the practitioner takes on the form of a deity in an illusory body (mƒÅyƒÅdeha), which is like the magician's illusion. It is made of wind, or prana, and is called illusory because it appears only to other yogis who have also attained the illusory body. The illusory body has the markings and signs of a Buddha. There is an impure and a pure illusory body, depending on the stage of the yogi's practice.Highest Yoga Tantra: An Introduction to the Esoteric Buddhism of Tibet, Daniel Cozort, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY 1986, pgs. 94-95. The concept that the world is an illusion is controversial in Buddhism. The Buddha does not state that the world is an illusion, but like an illusion. In the Dzogchen tradition the perceived reality is considered literally unreal, in that objects which make-up perceived reality are known as objects within one's mind, and that, as we conceive them, there is no pre-determined object, or assembly of objects in isolation from experience that may be considered the \\"true\\" object, or objects. As a prominent contemporary teacher puts it: \\"In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream [...]\\".Ch√∂gyal Namkhai Norbu Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, , pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105. In this context, the term visions denotes not only visual perceptions, but appearances perceived through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations. Different schools and traditions in Tibetan Buddhism give different explanations of the mechanism producing the illusion usually called \\"reality\\".El√≠as Capriles. : the Doctrine of the Buddha and the Supreme Vehicle of Tibetan Buddhism. Part 1 - Buddhism: a Dzogchen Outlook. Published on the Web. Even the illusory nature of apparent phenomena is itself an illusion. Ultimately, the yogi passes beyond a conception of things either existing or not existing, and beyond a conception of either samsara or nirvana. Only then is the yogi abiding in the ultimate reality.The Yoga Tradition:Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice, Georg Feuerstein, Hohm Press, Prescott, AZ, 1998, pg. 164. Jainism Jainism Maya, in Jainism, means appearances or deceit that prevents one from Samyaktva (right belief). Maya is one of three causes of failure to reach right belief. The other two are Mithyatva (false belief)JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, page 94 and Nidana (hankering after fame and worldly pleasures).Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval ≈örƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅras, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 50 Maya is a closely related concept to Mithyatva, with Maya a source of wrong information while Mithyatva an individual's attitude to knowledge, with relational overlap. Svetambara Jains classify categories of false belief under Mithyatva into five: Abhigrahika (false belief that is limited to one's own scriptures that one can defend, but refusing to study and analyze other scriptures); Anabhigrahika (false belief that equal respect must be shown to all gods, teachers, scriptures); Abhiniviseka (false belief resulting from pre-conceptions with a lack of discernment and refusal to do so); Samsayika (state of hesitation or uncertainty between various conflicting, inconsistent beliefs); and Anabhogika (innate, default false beliefs that a person has not thought through on one's own).Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval ≈örƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅras, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 47-49 Digambara Jains classify categories of false belief under Mithyatva into seven: Ekantika (absolute, one sided false belief), Samsayika (uncertainty, doubt whether a course is right or wrong, unsettled belief, skepticism), Vainayika (false belief that all gods, gurus and scriptures are alike, without critical examination), Grhita (false belief derived purely from habits or default, no self-analysis), Viparita (false belief that true is false, false is true, everything is relative or acceptable), Naisargika (false belief that all living beings are devoid of consciousness and cannot discern right from wrong), Mudha-drsti (false belief that violence and anger can tarnish or damage thoughts, divine, guru or dharma). MƒÅyƒÅ (deceit) is also considered as one of four Ka·π£aya (faulty passion, a trigger for actions) in Jain philosophy. The other three are Krodha (anger), MƒÅna (pride) and Lobha (greed).Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval ≈örƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅras, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 33 The ancient Jain texts recommend that one must subdue these four faults, as they are source of bondage, attachment and non-spiritual passions.P Jaini (1998), The Jaina Path of Purification, Motilal Banarsidass. , pages 119-122 Sikhism Sikhism In Sikhism, the world is regarded as both transitory and relatively real.Surinder Singh Kohli, Guru Granth Sahib: An Analytical Study. Singh Brothers, Amritsar, 1992, page 262. God is viewed as the only reality, but within God exist both conscious souls and nonconscious objects; these created objects are also real. Natural phenomena are real but the effects they generate are unreal. mƒÅyƒÅ is as the events are real yet mƒÅyƒÅ is not as the effects are unreal. Sikhism believes that people are trapped in the world because of five vices: lust, anger, greed, attachment, and ego. Maya enables these five vices and makes a person think the physical world is \\"real,\\" whereas, the goal of Sikhism is to rid the self of them. Consider the following example: In the moonless night, a rope lying on the ground may be mistaken for a snake. We know that the rope alone is real, not the snake. However, the failure to perceive the rope gives rise to the false perception of the snake. Once the darkness is removed, the rope alone remains; the snake disappears. * Sakti adher jevarhee bhram chookaa nihchal siv ghari vaasaa. In the darkness of mƒÅyƒÅ, I mistook the rope for the snake, but that is over, and now I dwell in the eternal home of the Lord. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib 332). * Raaj bhuiang prasang jaise hahi ab kashu maram janaaiaa. Like the story of the rope mistaken for a snake, the mystery has now been explained to me. Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were gold; now, I do not say what I said then. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib 658). In some mythologies the symbol of the snake was associated with money, and mƒÅyƒÅ in modern Punjabi refers to money. However, in the Guru Granth Sahib mƒÅyƒÅ refers to the \\"grand illusion\\" of materialism. From this mƒÅyƒÅ all other evils are born, but by understanding the nature of mƒÅyƒÅ a person begins to approach spirituality. * Janam baritha jƒÅ·πØ rang mƒÅ‚ñ´i‚ñ´ƒÅ kai. 1 rahƒÅ‚ñ´o. You are squandering this life uselessly in the love of mƒÅyƒÅ. Sri Guru Granth Sahib M.5 Guru Arjan Dev ANG 12 The teachings of the Sikh Gurus push the idea of sewa (selfless service) and simran (prayer, meditation, or remembering one's true death). The depths of these two concepts and the core of Sikhism comes from sangat (congregation): by joining the congregation of true saints one is saved. By contrast, most people are believed to suffer from the false consciousness of materialism, as described in the following extracts from the Guru Granth Sahib: * MƒÅ‚ñ´i‚ñ´ƒÅ mohi visƒÅri‚ñ´ƒÅ jaga·πØ pi·πØƒÅ par·πØipƒÅl. In attachment to mƒÅyƒÅ, they have forgotten the Father, the Cherisher of the World. Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das ANG 30 * Ih sarƒ´r mƒÅ‚ñ´i‚ñ´ƒÅ kƒÅ pu·πØlƒÅ vic·∫ñ ha‚ñ´umai ·∏èustƒ´ pƒÅ‚ñ´ƒ´. This body is the puppet of mƒÅyƒÅ. The evil of egotism is within it. Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das * BƒÅbƒÅ mƒÅ‚ñ´i‚ñ´ƒÅ b·∫ñaram b·∫ñulƒÅ‚ñ´e. O Baba, mƒÅyƒÅ deceives with its illusion. Sri Guru Granth Sahib M1 Guru Nanak Dev ANG 60 * \\"For that which we cannot see, feel, smell, touch, or understand, we do not believe.

This could include a sample of a microorganism, virus or toxin that can adversely affect human health. A biohazard could also be a substance harmful to other animals. The term and its associated symbol are generally used as a warning, so that those potentially exposed to the substances will know to take precautions. The biohazard symbol was developed in 1966 by Charles Baldwin, an environmental-health engineer working for the Dow Chemical Company on the containment products. It is used in the labeling of biological materials that carry a significant health risk, including viral samples and used hypodermic needles. In Unicode, the biohazard symbol is U+2623 (‚ò£). Classification Bio hazardous agents are classified for transportation by UN number: * Category A, UN 2814 ‚Äì Infectious substance, affecting humans: An infectious substance in a form capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs. * Category A, UN 2900 ‚Äì Infectious substance, affecting animals (only): An infectious substance that is not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans and animals when exposure to themselves occurs. * Category B, UN 3373 ‚Äì Biological substance transported for diagnostic or investigative purposes. * Regulated Medical Waste, UN 3291 ‚Äì Waste or reusable material derived from medical treatment of an animal or human, or from biomedical research, which includes the production and testing.  Levels of biohazard  Immediate disposal of used needles into a sharps container is standard procedure. NHS medics practice using protective equipment used when treating Ebola patients The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) categorizes various diseases in levels of biohazard, Level 1 being minimum risk and Level 4 being extreme risk. Laboratories and other facilities are categorized as BSL (Biosafety Level) 1‚Äì4 or as P1 through P4 for short (Pathogen or Protection Level). * Biohazard Level 1: Bacteria and viruses including Bacillus subtilis, canine hepatitis, Escherichia coli, and varicella (chickenpox), as well as some cell cultures and non-infectious bacteria. At this level precautions against the biohazardous materials in question are minimal, most likely involving gloves and some sort of facial protection. * Biohazard Level 2: Bacteria and viruses that cause only mild disease to humans, or are difficult to contract via aerosol in a lab setting, such as hepatitis A, B, and C, some influenza A strains, Human respiratory syncytial virus, Lyme disease, salmonella, mumps, measles, scrapie, dengue fever, and HIV. Routine diagnostic work with clinical specimens can be done safely at Biosafety Level 2, using Biosafety Level 2 practices and procedures. Research work (including co-cultivation, virus replication studies, or manipulations involving concentrated virus) can be done in a BSL-2 (P2) facility, using BSL-3 practices and procedures. * Biohazard Level 3: Bacteria and viruses that can cause severe to fatal disease in humans, but for which vaccines or other treatments exist, such as anthrax, West Nile virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, SARS- CoV-2, Influenza A H5N1, hantaviruses, tuberculosis, typhus, Rift Valley fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, yellow fever, and malaria. * Biohazard Level 4: Viruses that cause severe to fatal disease in humans, and for which vaccines or other treatments are not available, such as Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Lassa fever virus, Crimean‚ÄìCongo hemorrhagic fever, and other hemorrhagic diseases, as well as Nipah virus. Variola virus (smallpox) is an agent that is worked with at BSL-4 despite the existence of a vaccine, as it has been eradicated and thus the general population is no longer routinely vaccinated. When dealing with biological hazards at this level, the use of a positive pressure personnel suit with a segregated air supply is mandatory. The entrance and exit of a Level Four biolab will contain multiple showers, a vacuum room, an ultraviolet light room, autonomous detection system, and other safety precautions designed to destroy all traces of the biohazard. Multiple airlocks are employed and are electronically secured to prevent doors from both opening at the same time. All air and water service going to and coming from a Biosafety Level 4 (P4) lab will undergo similar decontamination procedures to eliminate the possibility of an accidental release. Currently there are no bacteria classified at this level. Symbol The biohazard symbol was developed by the Dow Chemical Company in 1966 for their containment products. According to Charles Baldwin, an environmental-health engineer who contributed to its development: \\"We wanted something that was memorable but meaningless, so we could educate people as to what it means.\\" In an article he wrote for Science in 1967,http://www.iconglobe.net/blog/2011/01/07/biohazard-symbol-history/ the symbol was presented as the new standard for all biological hazards (\\"biohazards\\"). The article explained that over 40 symbols were drawn up by Dow artists, and all of the symbols investigated had to meet a number of criteria: # Striking in form in order to draw immediate attention; # Unique and unambiguous, in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes; # Quickly recognizable and easily recalled; # Symmetric, in order to appear identical from all angles of approach; # Acceptable to groups of varying ethnic backgrounds. The chosen symbol scored the best on nationwide testing for memorability. alt=The Biohazard Symbol with dimensions as defined in https://archive.org/stream/federalregister39kunit#page/n849/mode/1up The design was first specified in 39 FR 23680 but was dropped in the succeeding amendment.

National Democratic Congress New Patriotic Party Political parties became legal in mid-1992 after a ten- year hiatus. There are more than 20 registered political parties under the Fourth Republic. The two main parties are the National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party. The National Democratic Congress is the successor organisation to Jerry John Rawlings' Provisional National Defence Council which was in power from 1981 to 1992. The New Patriotic Party, found in 1992, is the successor to the Gold Coast's The Big Six independence achiever party United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC); the People's National Convention, and the Convention People's Party, successor to Kwame Nkrumah's original party of the same name, which was the incumbent government of Ghana for 10 years from declaration of independence in 1957 to 1966, winning elections in 1956, 1960, and 1965. The National Democratic Congress won the presidential and parliamentary elections in 1992, 1996, 2008 and 2012. The New Patriotic Party won the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000, 2004, and 2016. =Foreign relations= Ghanaian diplomat Kofi Annan served as Secretary- General of the United Nations for nine years until 2006. Since independence, Ghana has been devoted to ideals of nonalignment and is a founding member of the non-aligned movement. Ghana favours international and regional political and economic co-operation, and is an active member of the United Nations and the African Union. Many Ghanaian diplomats and politicians hold positions in international organisations. These include Ghanaian diplomat and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, International Criminal Court Judge Akua Kuenyehia, former President Jerry John Rawlings and former President John Agyekum Kuffour who have both served as diplomats of the United Nations. In September 2010, Ghana's former President John Atta Mills visited China on an official visit. Mills and China's former President Hu Jintao, marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two nations, at the Great Hall of the People on 20 September 2010. China reciprocated with a visit in November 2011, by the Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Zhou Tienong who visited Ghana and met with Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama. =Judicial system= The legal system is based on the 1992 constitution, customary (traditional) law, and British common law. Court hierarchy consists of Supreme Court of Ghana (highest court), courts of appeal, and high courts of justice. Beneath these bodies are circuit, magisterial, and traditional courts. Extrajudicial institutions include public tribunals. Since independence, courts are relatively independent; this independence continues under the Republic. Lower courts are being redefined and reorganised under the Republic. =Administrative divisions= There are sixteen administrative regions of the Republic of Ghana which are divided into 6 metropolitan assemblies; 55 Municipal assemblies; and 216 districts, each with its own district assembly. Below districts are various types of councils, including 58 town or area councils; 108 zonal councils; and 626 area councils. Over 16,000 unit committees exist on the lowest level.

It is one of the first personal computers to present a graphical user interface (GUI) in a machine aimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978, and it underwent many changes during the development period before shipping at US$9,995 with a five-megabyte hard drive. The Lisa was challenged by a relatively high price, insufficient software library, unreliable Apple FileWare (\\"Twiggy\\") floppy disks, and the immediate release of the cheaper and faster Macintosh ‚Äî yielding lifelong sales of only 10,000 units in two years. In 1982, after Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, he appropriated the existing Macintosh project, which Jef Raskin had conceived in 1979 and led to develop a text-based appliance computer. Jobs immediately redefined Macintosh as a cheaper and more usable version of the graphical Lisa. Macintosh was launched in January 1984, quickly surpassing Lisa sales, and assimilating increasing numbers of Lisa staff. Newer Lisa models were introduced that addressed its faults and lowered its price considerably, but the platform failed to achieve favorable sales compared to the much less expensive Mac. The final model, the Lisa 2/10, was modified as the high end of the Macintosh series, the Macintosh XL. Considered a commercial failure but with technical acclaim, the Lisa introduced a number of advanced features that would not reappear on the Macintosh or the \\"PC\\" platform for many years. Among those is an operating system with protected memory and a more document-oriented workflow. The hardware overall is more advanced than the Macintosh, with a hard drive, support for up to 2 megabytes (MB) of random-access memory (RAM), expansion slots, and a larger, higher- resolution display. One notable exception is that the 68000 processor in the Macintosh is clocked at 7.89 megahertz (MHz) and the Lisa's is 5 MHz. The complexity of the primarily Pascal-coded Lisa operating system and its associated programs (most notably its office suite) ‚Äî as well as the ad hoc protected memory implementation (forced by Motorola not having provided an MMU) ‚Äî is highly-demanding for the CPU (which had no co-processor to speed graphical output) and, to some extent, the storage system. As a result of cost-cutting measures designed to bring the system more into the consumer bracket, advanced software, and other factors ‚Äî such as the delayed availability of the 68000 and its impact on the design process, Lisa feels sluggish overall. The workstation-tier (albeit at the low end of that spectrum) price and lack of much of a technical application library made it a difficult sell for much of the technical workstation market. However, the success of the earlier IBM PC and Apple's decision to compete with itself, mainly via the Macintosh, also were severe impediments for the platform. History =Development= Name Though the documentation shipped with the original Lisa only refers to it as \\"The Lisa\\", Apple officially stated the name was an acronym for \\"Locally Integrated Software Architecture\\" or \\"LISA\\". Because Steve Jobs' first daughter was named Lisa Nicole Brennan (born in 1978), it was normally inferred that the name also had a personal association, and perhaps that the acronym was a backronym invented later to fit the name. Andy Hertzfeld states the acronym was reverse engineered from the name \\"Lisa\\" in late 1982 by the Apple marketing team, after they had hired a marketing consultancy firm to come up with names to replace \\"Lisa\\" and \\"Macintosh\\" (at the time considered by Jef Raskin to be merely internal project codenames) and then rejected all of the suggestions. Privately, Hertzfeld and the other software developers used \\"Lisa: Invented Stupid Acronym\\", a recursive backronym, while computer industry pundits coined the term \\"Let's Invent Some Acronym\\" to fit the Lisa's name. Decades later, Jobs would tell his biographer Walter Isaacson: \\"Obviously it was named for my daughter.\\" Research and design The project began in 1978 as an effort to create a more modern version of the then-conventional design epitomized by the Apple II. A ten-person team occupied its first dedicated office, which was nicknamed \\"the Good Earth building\\" and located at 20863 Stevens Creek Boulevard next to the restaurant named Good Earth. Initial team leader Ken Rothmuller was soon replaced by John Couch, under whose direction the project evolved into the \\"window-and-mouse-driven\\" form of its eventual release. Trip Hawkins and Jef Raskin contributed to this change in design. Apple's cofounder Steve Jobs was involved in the concept. At Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, research had already been underway for several years to create a new humanized way to organize the computer screen, today known as the desktop metaphor. Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979, and was absorbed and excited by the revolutionary mouse-driven GUI of the Xerox Alto. By late 1979, Jobs successfully negotiated a payment of Apple stock to Xerox, in exchange for his Lisa team to receive two demonstrations of ongoing research projects at Xerox PARC. When the Apple team saw the demonstration of the Alto computer, they were able to see in action the basic elements of what constituted a workable GUI. The Lisa team put a great deal of work into making the graphical interface a mainstream commercial product. The Lisa was a major project at Apple, which reportedly spent more than $50 million on its development. More than 90 people participated in the design, plus more in the sales and marketing effort, to launch the machine. BYTE credited Wayne Rosing with being the most important person on the development of the computer's hardware until the machine went into production, at which point he became technical lead for the entire Lisa project. The hardware development team was headed by Robert Paratore. The industrial design, product design, and mechanical packaging were headed by Bill Dresselhaus, the Principal Product Designer of Lisa, with his team of internal product designers and contract product designers from the firm that eventually became IDEO. Bruce Daniels was in charge of applications development, and Larry Tesler was in charge of system software. The user interface was designed in a six-month period, after which, the hardware, operating system, and applications were all created in parallel. In 1982, after Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, he appropriated the existing Macintosh project, which Jef Raskin had conceived in 1979 and led to develop a text-based appliance computer. Jobs redefined Macintosh as a cheaper and more usable Lisa, leading the project in parallel and in secret, and substantially motivated to compete with the Lisa team. In September 1981, below the announcement of the IBM PC, InfoWorld reported on Lisa, \\"McIntosh\\", and another Apple computer secretly under development \\"to be ready for release within a year\\". It described Lisa as having a 68000 and 128KB RAM, and \\"designed to compete with the new Xerox Star at a considerably lower price\\". In May 1982 the magazine reported that \\"Apple's yet-to-be-announced Lisa 68000 network work station is also widely rumored to have a mouse.\\" =Launch= Lisa's low sales were quickly surpassed by the January 1984 launch of the Macintosh. Newer versions of the Lisa were introduced that addressed its faults and lowered its price considerably, but it failed to achieve favorable sales compared to the much less expensive Mac. The Macintosh project assimilated a lot more Lisa staff. The final revision of the Lisa, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL. =Discontinuation= The high cost and the delays in its release date contributed to the Lisa's discontinuation although it was repackaged and sold at $4,995, as the Lisa 2. In 1986, the entire Lisa platform was discontinued. In 1987, Sun Remarketing purchased about 5,000 Macintosh XLs and upgraded them. Some leftover Lisa computers and spare parts were available until recently when Cherokee Data (who purchased Sun Remarketing) went out of business. In 1989, with the help of Sun Remarketing, Apple disposed of approximately 2,700 unsold Lisas in a guarded landfill in Logan, Utah, in order to receive a tax write-off on the unsold inventory. Overview =Hardware= Lisa IO board with a Macintosh XL UV-EPROM installed The Lisa was first introduced on January 19, 1983. It is one of the first personal computer systems with a graphical user interface (GUI) to be sold commercially. It uses a Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 5 MHz and has 1 MB of RAM. It can be upgraded to 2 MB and later shipped with as little as 512 kilobytes. The CPU speed and model was not changed from the release of the Lisa 1 to the repackaging of the hardware as Macintosh XL. The real-time clock uses a 4-bit integer and the base year is defined as 1980, and the software won't accept any value below 1981 so the only valid range is 1981‚Äì1995. The real-time clock depends on a 4 x AA-cell NiCd pack of batteries that only lasts for a few hours when main power is not present. Prone to failure over time, the battery packs could leak corrosive alkaline electrolyte and ruin the circuit boards. The integrated monochrome black-on-white monitor has 720 √ó 364 rectangular pixels on a 12\\" screen. Among the printers supported by Lisa are the Apple Dot Matrix Printer, Apple Daisy Wheel Printer, the Apple ImageWriter dot matrix, and a Canon inkjet printer. Inkjet printing was quite new at the time. Despite having a monochromatic monitor, Apple enabled software to support some color printing, due to the existence of the Canon printer. CPU The use of the slowest-clocked version of Motorola's 68000 was a cost-cutting measure, as the 68000 was initially expensive. By the time the price had come down, Apple had already designed the Lisa software around the timing of the 5 MHz processor. Lisa had been in development for such a long time that it was not initially developed for the 68000 and much of its development was done on a pre-chip form of the 68000, which was much slower than the shipping CPU. Lisa software was primarily coded in Pascal- coded to save development time, given the high complexity of the software. The sophistication of the Lisa software (which included a multitasking GUI requiring a hard disk), coupled with the slow speed of the CPU, RAM, lack of hardware graphics acceleration co-processor, and protected memory implementation, led to the impression that the Lisa system was very slow. However, a productivity study done in 1984 rated the Lisa above the IBM PC and Macintosh, perhaps countering the high degree of focus on UI snappiness and other factors in perceived speed rather than actual productivity speed. RAM Lisa was designed to use slower, more reliable, parity memory, and other features that reduced speed but increased stability and value. Lisa is able to operate when RAM chips failed on its memory boards, unlike later Macintosh systems, reducing the cost to owners by enabling the usage of partially-failed boards. The Lisa system isolates the failed chip or chips and uses the rest of the board's RAM. This was particularly important given the large number of individual RAM chips Lisa used in 1983 for a consumer system (and around $2500 in cost to Apple per machine). RAM could be upgraded to 2 MB. Drives The original Lisa, or Lisa 1, has two Apple FileWare 5.25-inch double-sided variable-speed floppy disk drives, more commonly known by Apple's internal code name for the drive, \\"Twiggy\\". They have, for the time, a very high capacity of approximately 871 kB each, but proved to be unreliable and required non-standard diskettes. Competing systems implementing that level of per-diskette data storage had to utilize much larger 8\\" floppy disks. These disks were seen as cumbersome and old-fashioned for a consumer system. Apple had worked hard to increase the storage capacity of the minifloppy-size disk by pioneering features that Sony perfected shortly after with its microfloppy drives. Although it used a Twiggy in the prototype stage, the first Macintosh was launched the following year with one of the Sony 400 kB 3.5\\" \\"microfloppy\\" floppy disk drives. 1984 also saw the release of the first revision of Lisa, the Lisa 2, which also included a single Sony drive. Apple provided free upgrades to Lisa 1 owners to Lisa 2 hardware, including the replacement of the Twiggy drives with a single Sony. The Sony drive, being only single-sided, could not store nearly as much data as a single Twiggy, but did so with greater reliability. The IBM PC shipped with a minifloppy (5.25-inch) drive that stored even less data, 360K. It stored less data, was slower, and also did not have the protective shell of the Sony microfloppy drive diskettes, which improves reliability. An optional external 5 MB or, later, a 10 MB Apple ProFile hard drive (originally designed and produced for the Apple III by a third party), was available. With the introduction of the Lisa 2/10, an optional 10 MB compact internal proprietary hard disk manufactured by Apple, known as the \\"Widget\\", was also offered. As with the Twiggy, the Widget developed a reputation for reliability problems. The ProFile, by contrast, typically was long-lived. The Widget was incompatible with earlier Lisa models. In an effort to increase the reliability of the machine, Apple included, starting with Lisa 1, several of mechanisms involved with disk storage that were innovative and not present on at least early releases of the Macintosh, nor IBM PC. For example, block sparing was implemented, which would set aside bad blocks, even on floppy disks. Another feature was the redundant storage of critical operating system information, for recovery in case of corruption. Lisa 2 Lisa 2 The first hardware revision, the Lisa 2, was released in January 1984 and was priced between $3,495 and $5,495 US. It was much less expensive than the original model and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives in favor of a single 400k Sony microfloppy. The Lisa 2 has as little as 512 kB of RAM. The Lisa 2/5 consists of a Lisa 2 bundled with an external 5- or 10-megabyte hard drive. In 1984, at the same time the Macintosh was officially announced, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2/5 to all Lisa 1 owners, by swapping the pair of Twiggy drives for a single 3.5-inch drive, and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. In addition, the Lisa 2's new front faceplate accommodates the reconfigured floppy disk drive, and it includes the new inlaid Apple logo and the first Snow White design language elements. The Lisa 2/10 has a 10MB internal hard drive (but no external parallel port) and a standard configuration of 1MB of RAM. Developing early Macintosh software required a Lisa 2. There were relatively few third- party hardware offerings for the Lisa, as compared to the earlier Apple II. AST offered a 1.5 MB memory board, which ‚Äì when combined with the standard Apple 512 KB memory board ‚Äì expands the Lisa to a total of 2 MB of memory, the maximum amount that the MMU can address. Late in the product life of the Lisa, there were third-party hard disk drives, SCSI controllers, and double-sided 3.5-inch floppy-disk upgrades. Unlike the original Macintosh, the Lisa has expansion slots. The Lisa 2 motherboard has a very basic backplane with virtually no electronic components, but plenty of edge connector sockets and slots. There are two RAM slots, one CPU upgrade slot, and one I/O slot all in parallel placement to each other. At the other end, there are three \\"Lisa\\" slots in parallel. Macintosh XL Macintosh XL In January 1985, following the Macintosh, the Lisa 2/10 (with integrated 10 MB hard drive) was rebranded as Macintosh XL. It was given a hardware and software kit, enabling it to reboot into Macintosh mode and positioning it as Apple's high-end Macintosh. The price was lowered yet again, to $4,000 and sales tripled, but CEO John Sculley said that Apple would have lost money increasing production to meet the new demand. Apple discontinued the Macintosh XL, leaving an eight- month void in Apple's high-end product line until the Macintosh Plus was introduced in 1986. The report that many Lisa machines were never sold and were disposed of by Apple is particularly interesting in light of Sculley's decision concerning the increased demand. =Software= A screenshot of the Lisa Office System 3.1 Lisa OS The Lisa operating system features protected memory, enabled by a crude hardware circuit compared to the Sun-1 workstation (c. 1982), which features a full memory management unit. Motorola did not have an MMU (memory-management unit) for the 68000 ready in time, so third parties such as Apple had to come up with their own solutions. Despite the sluggishness of Apple's solution, which was also the result of a cost- cutting compromise, the Lisa system differed from the Macintosh system which had no protected memory until OS X, released eighteen years later. (Motorola's initial MMU also was disliked for its high cost and slow performance.) Based, in part, on elements from the Apple III SOS operating system released three years earlier, the Lisa's disk operating system also organizes its files in hierarchical directories, as do UNIX workstations of the time which were the main competition to Lisa in terms of price and hardware. Filesystem directories correspond to GUI folders, as with previous Xerox PARC computers from which the Lisa borrowed heavily. Unlike the first Macintosh, whose operating system could not utilize a hard disk in its first versions, the Lisa system was designed around a hard disk being present. Conceptually, the Lisa resembles the Xerox Star in the sense that it was envisioned as an office computing system. It also resembles Microsoft Office from a software standpoint, in that its software is designed to be an integrated \\"office suite\\". The Lisa's office software suite shipped long before the existence of Microsoft Office, although some of the constituent components differ (e.g. Lisa shipped with no presentation package and Office shipped without a projection package). Consequently, Lisa has two main user modes: the Lisa Office System and the Workshop. The Lisa Office System is the GUI environment for end users. The Workshop is a program development environment and is almost entirely text-based, though it uses a GUI text editor. The Lisa Office System was eventually renamed \\"7/7\\", in reference to the seven supplied application programs: LisaWrite, LisaCalc, LisaDraw, LisaGraph, LisaProject, LisaList, and LisaTerminal. Apple's warranty said that this software works precisely as stated, and Apple refunded an unspecified number of users, in full for their systems. These operating system frailties, and costly recalls, combined with the very high price point, led to the failure of the Lisa in the marketplace. NASA purchased Lisa machines, mainly to use the LisaProject program. In 2018, the Computer History Museum announced it would be releasing the source code for Lisa OS, following a check by Apple to ensure this would not impact other intellectual property. For copyright reasons, this release did not include the American Heritage dictionary. Task-oriented workflow With Lisa, Apple presented users with what is generally, but imprecisely, known as a document- oriented paradigm. This is contrasted with program-centric design. The user focuses more on the task to accomplish than the tool to accomplish it. Apple presents tasks, with Lisa, in the form of stationery. Rather than opening LisaWrite, for instance, to begin to do word processing, users initially \\"tear off stationery\\", visually, that represents the task of word processing. Either that, or they open an existing LisaWrite document that resembles that stationery. By contrast, the Macintosh and most other GUI systems focus primarily on the program that is used to accomplish a task ‚Äî directing users to that first. One benefit of task-based computing is that users have less of a need to memorize what program is associated with what task. That problem is compounded by the contemporary practice of naming programs with very unintuitive names such as Chrome and Safari. A drawback of task-oriented design, when presented in document-oriented form, is that the naturalness of the process can be lacking. The most frequently-cited example with Lisa is the use of LisaTerminal, in which a person tears off \\"terminal stationery\\" ‚Äî a broken metaphor. However, task-based design does not necessarily require characterizing everything as a document, or as stationery specifically. More recently, menus and tabs have been used, rather sparingly, to present more task-based workflows. A \\"power user\\" could have somewhat laboriously customized the Apple menu in many versions of Mac OS (prior to OS X) to contain folders that are task-oriented. Tab systems are typically add-ons for contemporary operating systems and can be organized in a task-based manner ‚Äî such as having a \\"web browsing\\" tab that contains various web browser programs. Task-oriented presentation is very helpful for systems that have many programs and a variety of users, such as a language-learning computer lab that caters to those learning a variety of languages. It is also helpful for computer users who have not yet memorized what program name, however unintuitive, is associated with a task. Some Linux desktop systems combine some unintuitive program names (e.g. Amarok) with task-based organization (menus that organize programs by task) ‚Äî in the desire to make utilizing Linux desktop systems less of a challenge for those switching from the dominant desktop platforms. The desire for emotional marketing reinforcement appears to be a strong factor in the choice, by most companies, to promote the program- centric paradigm. Otherwise, there would be little incentive to give programs obscure unintuitive names and/or to add company names to the program name (e.g. Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, etc.). Combining unintuitive names with company names is especially popular today (e.g. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox). This is the opposite goal of the Lisa paradigm where the brand name and the program name are intentionally made more invisible to the user. Internationalization Within a few months of the Lisa's introduction in the US, fully translated versions of the software and documentation were commercially available for the British, French, West German, Italian, and Spanish markets, followed by several Scandinavian versions shortly thereafter. The user interface for the OS, all seven applications, LisaGuide, and the Lisa diagnostics (in ROM) can be fully translated, without any programming required, using resource files and a translation kit. The keyboard can identify its native language layout, and the entire user experience will be in that language, including any hardware diagnostic messages. Although several non-English keyboard layouts are available, the Dvorak keyboard layout was never ported to the Lisa, though such porting had been available for the Apple III, IIe, and IIc, and was later done for the Macintosh. Keyboard-mapping on the Lisa is complex and requires building a new OS. All kernels contain images for all layouts, so due to serious memory constraints, keyboard layouts are stored as differences from a set of standard layouts; thus only a few bytes are needed to accommodate most additional layouts. An exception is the Dvorak layout that moves just about every key and thus requires hundreds of extra bytes of precious kernel storage regardless of whether it is needed. Each localized version (built on a globalized core) requires grammatical, linguistic, and cultural adaptations throughout the user interface, including formats for dates, numbers, times, currencies, sorting, even for word and phrase order in alerts and dialog boxes. A kit was provided, and the translation work was done by native-speaking Apple marketing staff in each country. This localization effort resulted in about as many Lisa unit sales outside the US as inside the US over the product's lifespan, while setting new standards for future localized software products, and for global project co- ordination. MacWorks In April 1984, following the release of the Macintosh, Apple introduced MacWorks, a software emulation environment which allows the Lisa to run Macintosh System software and applications. MacWorks helped make the Lisa more attractive to potential customers, although it did not enable the Macintosh emulation to access the hard disk until September. Initial versions of the Mac OS could not support a hard disk on the Macintosh machines. In January 1985, re-branded MacWorks XL, it became the primary system application designed to turn the Lisa into the Macintosh XL. Third- party software A screenshot of the Apple Lisa Workshop A significant impediment to third-party software on the Lisa was the fact that, when first launched, the Lisa Office System could not be used to write programs for itself. A separate development OS, called Lisa Workshop, was required. During this development process, engineers would alternate between the two OSes at startup, writing and compiling code on one OS and testing it on the other. Later, the same Lisa Workshop was used to develop software for the Macintosh. After a few years, a Macintosh-native development system was developed. For most of its lifetime, the Lisa never went beyond the original seven applications that Apple had deemed enough to \\"do everything\\", although UniPress Software did offer UNIX System III for $495. The company Santa Cruz Operation, (SCO), offered Microsoft XENIX (version 3), a UNIX-like command- line interface operating system, for the Lisa 2 ‚Äî and the Multiplan spreadsheet (version 2.1) for that. Reception An original Apple Lisa at work, Apple Convention, Boston, Spring 1983 BYTE wrote in February 1983 after previewing the Lisa that it was \\"the most important development in computers in the last five years, easily outpacing [the IBM PC]\\". It acknowledged that the $9,995 price was high, and concluded \\"Apple ... is not unaware that most people would be incredibly interested in a similar but less expensive machine. We'll see what happens\\". The Apple Lisa was a commercial failure for Apple, the largest since the failure of the Apple III of 1980. Apple sold approximately 10,000 Lisa machines at a price of , generating total sales of $100 million against a development cost of more than $150 million. The high price put the Lisa at the bottom of the price realm of technical workstations, but without much of a technical application library. Some features that some much more expensive competing systems included were such things as hardware graphics co-processors (which increased perceived system power by improving GUI snappiness) and higher-resolution portrait displays. Lisa's implementation of the requisite graphical interface paradigm was novel but many of the time associated UI snappiness with power, even if that was so simplistic as to miss the mark, in terms of overall productivity. The mouse, for example, was dismissed by many critics of the time as being a toy, and mouse-driven machines as being unserious. Of course, the mouse would go one to displace the pure-CLI design for the vast majority of users, later. The largest Lisa customer was NASA, which used LisaProject for project management.Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson Lisa was not slowed purely by having a 5 MHz CPU (the lowest clock offered by Motorola), sophisticated parity RAM, a slow hard disk interface (for the ProFile), and the lack of a graphics co-processor (which would have increased cost). It also had its software mainly coded in Pascal, was designed to multitask, and had advanced features like the clipboard for pasting data between programs. This sophistication came at the price of snappiness, although it added to productivity. The OS even had \\"soft power\\", remembering what was open and how desktop items were positioned. Many such features are taken for granted today but were not available on typical consumer systems. The massive brand power of IBM at that time was the largest factor in the PC's eventual dominance. Computing critics complained about the relatively primitive hardware (\\"off-the-shelf components\\") of the PC but admitted that it would be a success simply due to IBM's mindshare. By the time Lisa was available in the market, the less-expensive and less-powerful IBM PC had already become entrenched. The x86 platform's backward compatibility with the CP/M operating system was helpful for the PC, given that many existing business software applications originally written for CP/M. However, Apple had attempted to compete with the PC, via the Apple II platform, on that front. DOS was very primitive when compared with the Lisa OS, but the CLI was familiar territory for most users of the time. It would be years before Microsoft would offer an integrated office suite. The 1984 release of the Macintosh further eroded the Lisa's marketability, as the public perceived that Apple was abandoning it in favor of the Macintosh. Any marketing of the Macintosh clashed with promotion of the Lisa, since Apple had not made the platforms compatible. Macintosh was superficially faster (mainly in terms of UI responsiveness) than Lisa but much more primitive in key aspects, such as the lack of protected memory (which led to the famous bomb and completely frozen machines for so many years), very small amount of non-upgradable RAM, no ability to use a hard disk (which led to heavy criticism about frequent disk-swapping), no sophisticated file system, smaller-resolution display, lack of numeric keypad, lack of a built-in screensaver, inability to multitask, lack of parity RAM, lack of expansion slots, lack of a calculator with a paper tape and RPN, more primitive office software, and more. The Macintosh beat the Lisa in terms of having sound support (Lisa had only a beep), having square pixels (which reduced perceived resolution but removed the problem of display artifacts), having a nearly 8 MHz CPU, having more resources placed into marketing (leading to a large increase in the system's price tag), and being coded primarily in assembly. Some features, like protected memory, remained absent from the Macintosh platform for eighteen years, when OS X was released for the desktop. The Lisa was also designed to readily support multiple operating systems, making booting between them intuitive and convenient ‚Äî something that has taken a very long time to achieve since Lisa, at least as a standard desktop OS feature. The Lisa 2 and its Mac ROM-enabled sibling the Macintosh XL are the final two releases in the Lisa line, which was discontinued in April 1985.\\"Back in Time\\", A+ Magazine, Feb 1987: 48‚Äì49. The Macintosh XL is a hardware and software conversion kit to effectively reboot Lisa into Macintosh mode. In 1986, Apple offered all Lisa and XL owners the opportunity to return their computer, with an additional payment of US$1,498, in exchange for a Macintosh Plus and Hard Disk 20. Reportedly 2,700 working but unsold Lisa computers were buried in a landfill. Legacy The Macintosh project, led by Apple's cofounder Steve Jobs, borrowed heavily from the Lisa's GUI paradigm and directly took many of its staff, to create Apple's ultimate flagship platform of the next several decades and progenitor of the iPhone. The column-based interface, for instance, made particularly famous via OS X, had originally been developed for Lisa. It had been discarded in favor of the icon view. Apple's culture of object-oriented programming on Lisa contributed to the 1988 conception of Pink, the first attempt to rearchitect the operating system of Macintosh.

The bottled water industry has drawn criticism for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging, which consumes additional petrochemicals. The packaging has evolved from its original iteration for the purpose of partially offsetting environmental impacts of production and shipment. This has primarily involved packaging weight reduction. The weight of Aquafina bottles was reduced by approximately 50%, to , with a packaging redesign in 2009 which, according to the company, resulted in the use of 75 million fewer pounds of plastic during the production process. Sponsorship Since shortly after its inception, the promotion of Aquafina has involved sports sponsorships. As of 2011, it is listed as being an official sponsor of Major League Soccer, the Professional Golf Association, the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Carolina Panthers and the New York Giants. Its packaging also states that it is the \\"official water of Major League Baseball\\", which has been the case since the beginning of the 2008 MLB season. In NASCAR, it is a sponsor for Hendrick Motorsports and Kasey Kahne.

He is the youngest person to be king of France, the only one to have borne that title from birth, and the only one to hold the title for his entire life. His reign is the shortest of any French king. Although considered a king today, his status was not recognized until chroniclers and historians in later centuries began numbering John II, thereby acknowledging John I's brief reign. John reigned for five days under the regency of his uncle, Philip the Tall of France, until his death on 20 November 1316. His death ended the three centuries of father-to-son succession to the French throne. The infant king was buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis. He was succeeded by his uncle, Philip, whose contested legitimacy led to the re- affirmation of the Salic law, which excluded women from the line of succession to the French throne. Consequences Funerary convoy of John I. The child mortality rate was very high in medieval Europe and John may have died from any number of causes, but rumours of poisoning spread immediately after his death (including one which said that he had been murdered with a pin by his aunt),Magnificent Monarchs (Fact Attack series) p. 23 by Ian Locke; published by Macmillan in 1999; as many people benefited from it, and as John's father also died in strange circumstances. The cause of his death is still not known today. The premature death of John brought the first issue of succession of the Capetian dynasty. When Louis X, his father, died without a son to succeed him, it was the first time since Hugh Capet that the succession from father to son of the kings of France was interrupted. It was then decided to wait until his pregnant widow, Clementia of Hungary, delivered the child. The king's brother, Philip the Tall, was in charge of the regency of the kingdom against his uncle Charles of Valois. The birth of a male child was expected to give France its king. The problem of succession returned when John died five days after birth. Philip ascended the throne at the expense of John's four-year-old half-sister, Joan, daughter of Louis X and Margaret of Burgundy. Supposed survival Various legends circulated about this royal child. First, it was claimed that his uncle, Philip the Tall, had him poisoned. Then, a strange story a few decades later started the rumor that the little King John was not dead. During the captivity of John the Good (13561360), a man named Giannino Baglioni claimed to be John I and thus the heir to the throne. He tried to assert his rights, but was captured in Provence and died in captivity in 1363. In The Man Who Believed He Was King of France, Tommaso di Carpegna Falconieri suggests that Cola di Rienzo manufactured false evidence that Baglioni was John the Posthumous in order to strengthen his own power in Rome by placing Baglioni on the French throne. Shortly after they met in 1354, di Rienzo was assassinated, and Baglioni waited two years to report his claims. He went to the Hungarian court where Louis I of Hungary, nephew of Clementia of Hungary, recognized him as the son of Louis and Clementia. In 1360, Baglioni went to Avignon, but Pope Innocent VI refused to receive him. After several attempts to gain recognition, he was arrested and imprisoned in Naples, where he died in 1363. Maurice Druon's historical novel series Les Rois maudits dramatises this theory. In La Loi des m√¢les (1957), the infant John is temporarily switched with the child of Guccio Baglioni and Marie de Cressay as a decoy. He is subsequently poisoned by Mahaut, Countess of Artois, in order to place John's uncle (and Mahaut's son-in-law), Philippe, Count of Poitiers, on the throne. Marie is coerced into secretly raising John as her own son, named Giannino Baglioni. An adult Giannino was portrayed by Jean-G√©rard Sandoz in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by Lorans Stoica in the 2005 adaptation.

South is one of the cardinal directions or compass points. South is the opposite of north and is perpendicular to the east and west. Etymology The word south comes from Old English s≈´√æ, from earlier Proto-Germanic *sun√æaz (\\"south\\"), possibly related to the same Proto-Indo-European root that the word sun derived from. Some languages describe south in the same way, from the fact that it is the direction of the sun at noon (in the Northern Hemisphere), like Latin meridies 'noon, south' (from medius 'middle' + dies 'day', cf English meridional), while others describe south as the right-hand side of the rising sun, like Biblical Hebrew ◊™÷µ÷º◊ô◊û÷∏◊ü teiman 'south' from ◊ô÷∏◊û÷¥◊ô◊ü yamin 'right', Aramaic ◊™÷∑÷º◊ô◊û◊†÷∑◊ê taymna from ◊ô÷∏◊û÷¥◊ô◊ü yamin 'right' and Syriac ‹¨‹∞‹ù‹°‹¢‹≥‹ê taymna from ‹ù‹∞‹°‹ù‹∫‹¢‹≥‹ê yamina (hence the name of Yemen, the land to the south/right of the Levant). Navigation By convention, the bottom side of a map is south, although reversed maps exist that defy this convention. To go south using a compass for navigation, set a bearing or azimuth of 180¬∞. Alternatively, in the Northern Hemisphere outside the tropics, the Sun will be roughly in the south at midday. South Pole True south is the direction towards the sun end of the axis about which the Earth rotates, called the South Pole. The South Pole is located in Antarctica. Magnetic south is the direction towards the south magnetic pole, some distance away from the south geographic pole. Roald Amundsen, from Norway, was the first person to reach the South Pole, on 14 December 1911, after Ernest Shackleton from the UK was forced to turn back some distance short. Geography The Global South refers to the socially and economically less-developed southern half of the globe. 95% of the Global North has enough food and shelter, and a functioning education system. In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has enough food and shelter. It \\"lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports\\". Use of the term \\"South\\" may also be country- relative, particularly in cases of noticeable economic or cultural divide. For example, the Southern United States, separated from the Northeastern United States by the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, or the South of England, which is politically and economically unmatched with all of the North of England. Southern Cone is the name that is often referred to as the southernmost area of South America that, in the form of an inverted \\"cone\\", almost like a large peninsula, encompasses Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and the entire South of Brazil (Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paran√° and S√£o Paulo). Rarely does the meaning broaden to Bolivia, and in the most restricted sense it only covers Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. The country of South Africa is so named because of its location at the southern tip of Africa. Upon formation the country was named the Union of South Africa in English, reflecting its origin from the unification of four formerly separate British colonies. Australia derives its name from the Latin Terra Australis (\\"Southern Land\\"), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times. Other uses In the card game bridge, one of the players is known for scoring purposes as South. South partners with North and plays against East and West. In Greek religion, Notos, was the south wind and bringer of the storms of late summer and autumn.

Spaceflight can occur with spacecraft with or without humans on board. Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union was the first human to conduct a spaceflight. Examples of human spaceflight include the U.S. Apollo Moon landing and Space Shuttle programs and the Russian Soyuz program, as well as the ongoing International Space Station. Examples of uncrewed spaceflight include space probes that leave Earth orbit, as well as satellites in orbit around Earth, such as communications satellites. These operate either by telerobotic control or are fully autonomous. Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites. Spaceflight can be achieved with different types of launch systems, conventionally by rocket launching, which provide the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propel a spacecraft from the surface of the Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft ‚Äì both when unpropelled and when under propulsion ‚Äì is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.  History  Tsiolkovsky, early space theorist The first theoretical proposal of space travel using rockets was published by Scottish astronomer and mathematician William Leitch, in an 1861 essay \\"A Journey Through Space\\". More well-known (though not widely outside Russia) is Konstantin Tsiolkovsky's work, \\"\\" (The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices), published in 1903. Tsiolkovsky's rocketry work was not fully appreciated in his lifetime, but he influenced Sergey Korolev, who became the Soviet Union's chief rocket designer under Joseph Stalin, to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles to carry nuclear weapons as a counter measure to United States bomber planes. Derivatives of Korolev's R-7 Semyorka missiles were used to launch the world's first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957, and later the first human to orbit the Earth, Yuri Gagarin in Vostok 1, on April 12, 1961.Peter Bond, Obituary: Lt-Gen Kerim Kerimov, The Independent, 7 April 2003. Spaceflight became an engineering possibility with the work of Robert H. Goddard's publication in 1919 of his paper A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes. His application of the de Laval nozzle to liquid fuel rockets improved efficiency enough for interplanetary travel to become possible. He also proved in the laboratory that rockets would work in the vacuum of space; nonetheless, his work was not taken seriously by the public. His attempt to secure an Army contract for a rocket-propelled weapon in the first World War was defeated by the November 11, 1918 armistice with Germany. Working with private financial support, he was the first to launch a liquid-fueled rocket in 1926. Goddard's papers were highly influential internationally in his field. In the course of World War II the first guided rockets, the V-2 were developed and employed as weapons by the Third Reich. At a test flight in June 1944 one such rocket reached space at an altitude of , becoming the first object in human history to do so. At the end of World War II, most of the V-2 rocket team including its head Wernher von Braun surrendered to the United States, and were expatriated to work on American missiles at what became the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. This work on missiles such as Juno I and Atlas enabled launch of the first US satellite Explorer 1 on February 1, 1958, and the first American in orbit, John Glenn in Friendship 7 on February 20, 1962. As director of the Marshall Space Flight Center, Von Braun oversaw development of a larger class of rocket called Saturn, which allowed the US to send the first two humans, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, to the Moon and back on Apollo 11 in July 1969. At the same time, the Soviet Union secretly tried but failed to develop the N1 rocket, meant to give them the capability to land humans on the Moon.  Phases  = Launch = Rockets are the only means currently capable of reaching orbit or beyond. Other non-rocket spacelaunch technologies have yet to be built, or remain short of orbital speeds. A rocket launch for a spaceflight usually starts from a spaceport (cosmodrome), which may be equipped with launch complexes and launch pads for vertical rocket launches, and runways for takeoff and landing of carrier airplanes and winged spacecraft. Spaceports are situated well away from human habitation for noise and safety reasons. ICBMs have various special launching facilities. A launch is often restricted to certain launch windows. These windows depend upon the position of celestial bodies and orbits relative to the launch site. The biggest influence is often the rotation of the Earth itself. Once launched, orbits are normally located within relatively constant flat planes at a fixed angle to the axis of the Earth, and the Earth rotates within this orbit. A launch pad is a fixed structure designed to dispatch airborne vehicles. It generally consists of a launch tower and flame trench. It is surrounded by equipment used to erect, fuel, and maintain launch vehicles. Before launch, the rocket can weigh many hundreds of tonnes. The Space Shuttle Columbia, on STS-1, weighed at takeoff. = Reaching space = The most commonly used definition of outer space is everything beyond the K√°rm√°n line, which is above the Earth's surface. The United States sometimes defines outer space as everything beyond in altitude. Rocket engines are the only currently practical means of reaching space. Conventional airplane engines cannot reach space due to the lack of oxygen. Rocket engines expel propellant to provide forward thrust that generates enough delta-v (change in velocity) to reach orbit. For crewed launch systems launch escape systems are frequently fitted to allow astronauts to escape in the case of emergency.  Alternatives  Many ways to reach space other than rocket engines have been proposed. Ideas such as the space elevator, and momentum exchange tethers like rotovators or skyhooks require new materials much stronger than any currently known. Electromagnetic launchers such as launch loops might be feasible with current technology. Other ideas include rocket assisted aircraft/spaceplanes such as Reaction Engines Skylon (currently in early stage development), scramjet powered spaceplanes, and RBCC powered spaceplanes. Gun launch has been proposed for cargo. = Leaving orbit = Launched in 1959, Luna 1 was the first known artificial object to achieve escape velocity from the Earth. (replica pictured) Achieving a closed orbit is not essential to lunar and interplanetary voyages. Early Soviet space vehicles successfully achieved very high altitudes without going into orbit. NASA considered launching Apollo missions directly into lunar trajectories but adopted the strategy of first entering a temporary parking orbit and then performing a separate burn several orbits later onto a lunar trajectory. The parking orbit approach greatly simplified Apollo mission planning in several important ways. It acted as a \\"time buffer\\" and substantially widened the allowable launch windows. The parking orbit gave the crew and controllers several hours to thoroughly check out the spacecraft after the stresses of launch before committing it for a long journey to the Moon. Apollo missions minimized the performance penalty of the parking orbit by keeping its altitude as low as possible. For example, Apollo 15 used an unusually low parking orbit of which is not sustainable for very long due to friction with the Earth's atmosphere, but the crew would only spend three hours before reigniting the S-IVB third stage to put them on a lunar-bound trajectory. Robotic missions do not require an abort capability or radiation minimization, and because modern launchers routinely meet \\"instantaneous\\" launch windows, space probes to the Moon and other planets generally use direct injection to maximize performance. Although some might coast briefly during the launch sequence, they do not complete one or more full parking orbits before the burn that injects them onto an Earth escape trajectory. The escape velocity from a celestial body decreases with altitude above that body. However, it is more fuel-efficient for a craft to burn its fuel as close to the ground as possible; see Oberth effect and reference.Escape Velocity of Earth. Van.physics.uiuc.edu. Retrieved on 2011-10-05. This is another way to explain the performance penalty associated with establishing the safe perigee of a parking orbit. = Astrodynamics = Astrodynamics is the study of spacecraft trajectories, particularly as they relate to gravitational and propulsion effects. Astrodynamics allows for a spacecraft to arrive at its destination at the correct time without excessive propellant use. An orbital maneuvering system may be needed to maintain or change orbits. Non-rocket orbital propulsion methods include solar sails, magnetic sails, plasma-bubble magnetic systems, and using gravitational slingshot effects. = Transfer energy = The term \\"transfer energy\\" means the total amount of energy imparted by a rocket stage to its payload. This can be the energy imparted by a first stage of a launch vehicle to an upper stage plus payload, or by an upper stage or spacecraft kick motor to a spacecraft. = Reaching space station = In order to reach towards a space station, a spacecraft would have to arrive at the same orbit and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). This is done by a set of orbital maneuvers called space rendezvous. After rendezvousing with the space station, the space vehicle then docks or berths with the station. Docking refers to joining of two separate free-flying space vehicles, while berthing refers to mating operations where an inactive vehicle is placed into the mating interface of another space vehicle by using a robotic arm. = Reentry = Vehicles in orbit have large amounts of kinetic energy. This energy must be discarded if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere. Typically this process requires special methods to protect against aerodynamic heating. The theory behind reentry was developed by Harry Julian Allen. Based on this theory, reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry. Blunt shapes mean that less than 1% of the kinetic energy ends up as heat that reaches the vehicle, and the remainder heats up the atmosphere. = Landing and recovery = The Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsules all splashed down in the sea. These capsules were designed to land at relatively low speeds with the help of a parachute. Soviet/Russian capsules for Soyuz make use of a big parachute and braking rockets to touch down on land. Spaceplanes like the Space Shuttle land like a glider. After a successful landing the spacecraft, its occupants and cargo can be recovered. In some cases, recovery has occurred before landing: while a spacecraft is still descending on its parachute, it can be snagged by a specially designed aircraft. This mid-air retrieval technique was used to recover the film canisters from the Corona spy satellites.  Types  = Uncrewed = Sojourner takes its Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer measurement of Yogi Rock on Mars The MESSENGER spacecraft at Mercury (artist's interpretation) Uncrewed spaceflight is all spaceflight activity without a necessary human presence in space. This includes all space probes, satellites and robotic spacecraft and missions. Uncrewed spaceflight is the opposite of crewed spaceflight, which is usually called human spaceflight. Subcategories of uncrewed spaceflight are \\"robotic spacecraft\\" (objects) and \\"robotic space missions\\" (activities). A robotic spacecraft is an uncrewed spacecraft with no humans on board, that is usually under telerobotic control. A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe. Uncrewed space missions use remote-controlled spacecraft. The first uncrewed space mission was Sputnik, launched October 4, 1957 to orbit the Earth. Space missions where other animals but no humans are on-board are considered uncrewed missions.  Benefits  Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them. Telerobotics also allows exploration of regions that are vulnerable to contamination by Earth micro-organisms since spacecraft can be sterilized. Humans can not be sterilized in the same way as a spaceship, as they coexist with numerous micro-organisms, and these micro- organisms are also hard to contain within a spaceship or spacesuit.  Telepresence  Telerobotics becomes telepresence when the time delay is short enough to permit control of the spacecraft in close to real time by humans. Even the two seconds light speed delay for the Moon is too far away for telepresence exploration from Earth. The L1 and L2 positions permit 400-millisecond round trip delays, which is just close enough for telepresence operation. Telepresence has also been suggested as a way to repair satellites in Earth orbit from Earth. The Exploration Telerobotics Symposium in 2012 explored this and other topics.Exploration Telerobotics Symposium May 2‚Äì3, 2012 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. = Human = ISS crew member stores samples The first human spaceflight was Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961, on which cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin of the USSR made one orbit around the Earth. In official Soviet documents, there is no mention of the fact that Gagarin parachuted the final seven miles.Vostok 1. Astronautix.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-05. As of 2020, the only spacecraft regularly used for human spaceflight are Soyuz, Shenzhou, and Crew Dragon. The U.S. Space Shuttle fleet operated from April 1981 until July 2011. SpaceShipOne has conducted two human suborbital spaceflights. = Sub-orbital = The North American X-15 in flight. X-15 flew above twice and both of the flights were piloted by Joe Walker (astronaut) On a sub-orbital spaceflight the spacecraft reaches space and then returns to the atmosphere after following a (primarily) ballistic trajectory. This is usually because of insufficient specific orbital energy, in which case a suborbital flight will last only a few minutes, but it is also possible for an object with enough energy for an orbit to have a trajectory that intersects the Earth's atmosphere, sometimes after many hours. Pioneer 1 was NASA's first space probe intended to reach the Moon. A partial failure caused it to instead follow a suborbital trajectory to an altitude of before reentering the Earth's atmosphere 43 hours after launch. The most generally recognized boundary of space is the K√°rm√°n line above sea level. (NASA alternatively defines an astronaut as someone who has flown more than above sea level.) It is not generally recognized by the public that the increase in potential energy required to pass the K√°rm√°n line is only about 3% of the orbital energy (potential plus kinetic energy) required by the lowest possible Earth orbit (a circular orbit just above the K√°rm√°n line.) In other words, it is far easier to reach space than to stay there. On May 17, 2004, Civilian Space eXploration Team launched the GoFast rocket on a suborbital flight, the first amateur spaceflight. On June 21, 2004, SpaceShipOne was used for the first privately funded human spaceflight. = Point-to-point = Point-to- point is a category of sub-orbital spaceflight in which a spacecraft provides rapid transport between two terrestrial locations. A conventional airline route between London and Sydney, a flight that normally lasts over twenty hours. With point-to-point suborbital travel the same route could be traversed in less than one hour. While no company offers this type of transportation today, SpaceX has revealed plans to do so as early as the 2020s using Starship. Suborbital spaceflight over an intercontinental distance requires a vehicle velocity that is only a little lower than the velocity required to reach low Earth orbit. If rockets are used, the size of the rocket relative to the payload is similar to an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). Any intercontinental spaceflight has to surmount problems of heating during atmosphere re-entry that are nearly as large as those faced by orbital spaceflight. = Orbital = Apollo 6 heads into orbit A minimal orbital spaceflight requires much higher velocities than a minimal sub-orbital flight, and so it is technologically much more challenging to achieve. To achieve orbital spaceflight, the tangential velocity around the Earth is as important as altitude. In order to perform a stable and lasting flight in space, the spacecraft must reach the minimal orbital speed required for a closed orbit. = Interplanetary = Interplanetary spaceflight is flight between planets within a single planetary system. In practice, the use of the term is confined to travel between the planets of our Solar System. Plans for future crewed interplanetary spaceflight missions often include final vehicle assembly in Earth orbit, such as NASA's Constellation program and Russia's Kliper/Parom tandem. = Interstellar = ‚Äò‚ÄôNew Horizons‚Äô‚Äô is the fifth spacecraft put on an escape trajectory leaving the Solar System. Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11 are the earlier ones. The one farthest from the Sun is Voyager 1, which is more than 100 AU distant and is moving at 3.6 AU per year. In comparison, Proxima Centauri, the closest star other than the Sun, is 267,000 AU distant. It will take Voyager 1 over 74,000 years to reach this distance. Vehicle designs using other techniques, such as nuclear pulse propulsion are likely to be able to reach the nearest star significantly faster. Another possibility that could allow for human interstellar spaceflight is to make use of time dilation, as this would make it possible for passengers in a fast- moving vehicle to travel further into the future while aging very little, in that their great speed slows down the rate of passage of on-board time. However, attaining such high speeds would still require the use of some new, advanced method of propulsion. = Intergalactic = Intergalactic travel involves spaceflight between galaxies, and is considered much more technologically demanding than even interstellar travel and, by current engineering terms, is considered science fiction.  Spacecraft  An Apollo Lunar Module on the lunar surface Spacecraft are vehicles capable of controlling their trajectory through space. The first 'true spacecraft' is sometimes said to be Apollo Lunar Module,Apollo Expeditions to the Moon: Chapter 10. History.nasa.gov (1969-03-03). Retrieved on 2011-10-05. since this was the only crewed vehicle to have been designed for, and operated only in space; and is notable for its non-aerodynamic shape. = Propulsion = Spacecraft today predominantly use rockets for propulsion, but other propulsion techniques such as ion drives are becoming more common, particularly for uncrewed vehicles, and this can significantly reduce the vehicle's mass and increase its delta-v. = Launch systems = Launch systems are used to carry a payload from Earth's surface into outer space.  Expendable  Most current spaceflight uses multi-stage expendable launch systems to reach space.  Reusable  The first reusable spacecraft, the X-15, was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on 19 July 1963. The first partially reusable orbital spacecraft, the Space Shuttle, was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight, on 12 April 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which flown in the atmosphere and five of which flown in space. The Enterprise was used only for approach and landing tests, launching from the back of a Boeing 747 and gliding to deadstick landings at Edwards AFB, California. The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was the Columbia, followed by the Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour. The Endeavour was built to replace the Challenger, which was lost in January 1986. The Columbia broke up during reentry in February 2003. The first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the Buran (Snowstorm), launched by the USSR on 15 November 1988, although it made only one flight. This spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the US Space Shuttle, although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the American Shuttle. Lack of funding, complicated by the dissolution of the USSR, prevented any further flights of Buran. The Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 due mainly to its old age and high cost of the program reaching over a billion dollars per flight. The Shuttle's human transport role is to be replaced by the SpaceX Dragon 2 and CST-100 in 2020s. The Shuttle's heavy cargo transport role is replaced by commercial launch vehicles. Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the Ansari X Prize. The Spaceship Company has built its successor SpaceShipTwo. A fleet of SpaceShipTwos operated by Virgin Galactic planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers (space tourists) in 2008, but this was delayed due to an accident in the propulsion development.Launch aircraft development continues while suborbital ship awaits investigation into fatal explosion in California, retrieved 2012-01-27. SpaceX achieved the first vertical soft landing of a re-usable orbital rocket stage on December 21, 2015, after delivering 11 Orbcomm OG-2 commercial satellites into low Earth orbit. The first Falcon 9 second flight occurred on 30 March 2017. SpaceX now routinely recovers and reuses their first stages, with the intent of reusing fairings as well.

There is therefore some risk that this energy can be released prematurely and suddenly, with significant effects. When a Delta II rocket exploded 13 seconds after launch on January 17, 1997, there were reports of store windows away being broken by the blast. Space is a fairly predictable environment, but there are still risks of accidental depressurization and the potential failure of equipment, some of which may be very newly developed. In 2004 the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety was established in the Netherlands to further international cooperation and scientific advancement in space systems safety. = Weightlessness = ISS in weightless conditions. Michael Foale can be seen exercising in the foreground. In a microgravity environment such as that provided by a spacecraft in orbit around the Earth, humans experience a sense of \\"weightlessness.\\" Short-term exposure to microgravity causes space adaptation syndrome, a self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system. Long-term exposure causes multiple health issues. The most significant is bone loss, some of which is permanent, but microgravity also leads to significant deconditioning of muscular and cardiovascular tissues. = Radiation = Once above the atmosphere, radiation due to the Van Allen belts, solar radiation and cosmic radiation issues occur and increase. Further away from the Earth, solar flares can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes, and the health threat from cosmic radiation significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade exposure or more.Super Spaceships, NASA, 16 September 2002, Retrieved 25 October 2011. = Life support = In human spaceflight, the life support system is a group of devices that allow a human being to survive in outer space. NASA often uses the phrase Environmental Control and Life Support System or the acronym ECLSS when describing these systems for its human spaceflight missions. The life support system may supply: air, water and food. It must also maintain the correct body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life support system are life-critical, and are designed and constructed using safety engineering techniques. = Space weather = Aurora australis and Discovery, May 1991. Space weather is the concept of changing environmental conditions in outer space. It is distinct from the concept of weather within a planetary atmosphere, and deals with phenomena involving ambient plasma, magnetic fields, radiation and other matter in space (generally close to Earth but also in interplanetary, and occasionally interstellar medium). \\"Space weather describes the conditions in space that affect Earth and its technological systems. Our space weather is a consequence of the behavior of the Sun, the nature of Earth's magnetic field, and our location in the Solar System.\\"Space Weather: A Research Perspective, National Academy of Science, 1997 Space weather exerts a profound influence in several areas related to space exploration and development. Changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing the rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in Low Earth orbit. Geomagnetic storms due to increased solar activity can potentially blind sensors aboard spacecraft, or interfere with on-board electronics. An understanding of space environmental conditions is also important in designing shielding and life support systems for crewed spacecraft. = Environmental considerations = Rockets as a class are not inherently grossly polluting. However, some rockets use toxic propellants, and most vehicles use propellants that are not carbon neutral. Many solid rockets have chlorine in the form of perchlorate or other chemicals, and this can cause temporary local holes in the ozone layer. Re-entering spacecraft generate nitrates which also can temporarily impact the ozone layer. Most rockets are made of metals that can have an environmental impact during their construction. In addition to the atmospheric effects there are effects on the near-Earth space environment. There is the possibility that orbit could become inaccessible for generations due to exponentially increasing space debris caused by spalling of satellites and vehicles (Kessler syndrome). Many launched vehicles today are therefore designed to be re-entered after use.  Applications  This shows an extreme ultraviolet view of the Sun (the Apollo Telescope Mount SO82A Experiment) taken during Skylab 3, with the Earth added for scale. On the right an image of the Sun shows a helium emissions, and there is an image on the left showing emissions from iron. One application for spaceflight is to take observation hindered or made more difficult by being on Earth's surface. Skylab included a massive crewed solar observatory that revolutionized solar science in the early 1970s using the Apollo-based space station in conjunction with crewed spaceflights to it. Current and proposed applications for spaceflight include: * Earth observation satellites such as spy satellites, weather satellites * Space exploration * Communication satellites * Satellite television * Satellite navigation * Space tourism * Protecting Earth from potentially hazardous objects * Space colonization Most early spaceflight development was paid for by governments. However, today major launch markets such as communication satellites and satellite television are purely commercial, though many of the launchers were originally funded by governments. Private spaceflight is a rapidly developing area: space flight that is not only paid for by corporations or even private individuals, but often provided by private spaceflight companies. These companies often assert that much of the previous high cost of access to space was caused by governmental inefficiencies they can avoid. This assertion can be supported by much lower published launch costs for private space launch vehicles such as Falcon 9 developed with private financing. Lower launch costs and excellent safety will be required for the applications such as space tourism and especially space colonization to become feasible for expansion. Spacefaring nations and other entities To be spacefaring is to be capable of and active in space travel or space transport, the operation of spacecraft or spaceplanes. It involves a knowledge of a variety of topics and development of specialised skills including: aeronautics; astronautics; programs to train astronauts; space weather and forecasting; ship-handling and small craft handling; operation of various equipment; spacecraft design and construction; atmospheric takeoff and reentry; orbital mechanics (a.k.a. astrodynamics); communications; engines and rockets; execution of evolutions such as towing, micro-gravity construction, and space docking; cargo handling equipment, dangerous cargoes and cargo storage; spacewalking; dealing with emergencies; survival at space and first aid; fire fighting; life support. The degree of knowledge needed within these areas is dependent upon the nature of the work and the type of vessel employed. \\"Spacefaring\\" is analogous to seafaring. There has never been a crewed mission outside the Earth‚ÄìMoon system. However, the United States, Russia, China, European Space Agency countries, and a few corporations and enterprises have plans in various stages to travel to Mars (see Human mission to Mars). Spacefaring entities can be sovereign states, supranational entities, and private corporations. Spacefaring nations are those capable of independently building and launching craft into space.spacefaring - Definitions from Dictionary.comspacefaring. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000 space-faring nation thefeedictionary.com A growing number of private entities have become or are becoming space faring.

Canada had designed and built satellites (Alouette 1 & 2) in 1962 & 1965 which were orbited using US launch vehicles. Italy has designed and built several satellites, as well as pressurized (crewed) modules for the International Space Station. Early Italian satellites were launched using vehicles provided by NASA, first from Wallops Flight Facility in 1964 and then from a spaceport in Kenya (San Marco Platform) between 1967 and 1988; Italy has led the development of the Vega rocket programme within the European Space Agency since 1998. The United Kingdom abandoned its independent space launch programme in 1972 in favour of co-operating with the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) on launch technologies until 1974. Australia abandoned its launcher programme shortly after the successful launch of WRESAT, and became the only non-European member of ELDO. If one considers merely launching an object beyond the K√°rm√°n line to be the minimum requirement of spacefaring, then Germany, with the V-2 rocket, became the first spacefaring nation in 1944.Peenem√ºnde, Walter Dornberger, Moewig, Berlin 1984. .

He was referred to as the \\"Fifth Beatle\\" in reference to his extensive involvement on each of the Beatles' original albums. Paul McCartney said upon Martin's death, \\"If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle, it was George\\". Martin's career spanned more than six decades of work in music, film, television and live performance. Before working with the Beatles and other pop musicians, he produced comedy and novelty records in the early 1950s, working with Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Bernard Cribbins, among others. In his career he produced 30 number-one hit singles in the United Kingdom and 23 number-one hits in the United States. He also held a number of senior executive roles at media companies and contributed to a wide range of charitable causes, including his work for The Prince's Trust and the Caribbean island of Montserrat. In recognition of his services to the music industry and popular culture, he was made a Knight Bachelor in 1996. Early years Martin was born January 3, 1926, in Highbury, London. When Martin was six, his family acquired a piano that sparked his interest in music.Martin (1989) p. 13 At eight years of age, Martin persuaded his parents, Henry and Betha Beatrice (nƒóe Simpson) Martin,Mosley (2003) pp. 2631-32 that he should take piano lessons, but those ended after only eight lessons because of a disagreement between his mother and the teacher. As a child, he attended several schools, including a \\"convent school in Holloway\\", St Joseph's School (Highgate), and at St Ignatius' College (Stamford Hill), where he had won a scholarship. When WWII broke out, and St. Ignatius College students were evacuated to Welwyn Garden City, his family left London, and he was enrolled at Bromley Grammar School. Despite Martin's continued interest in music, and \\"fantasies about being the next Rachmaninoff\\", he did not initially choose music as a career. He worked briefly as a quantity surveyor, and later for the War Office as a Temporary Clerk (Grade Three), which meant filing paperwork and making tea. In 1943, when he was 17, he joined the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy and became an aerial observer and a commissioned officer. The war ended before Martin was involved in any combat, and he left the service in 1947. Encouraged by the pianist, teacher and broadcaster Sidney Harrison Martin used his veteran's grant to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama from 1947 to 1950, where he studied piano and oboe, and was interested in the music of Rachmaninoff and Ravel, as well as Cole Porter. Martin's oboe teacher was Margaret Eliot (the mother of Jane Asher, who would later become involved with Paul McCartney). After that, Martin explained that he had just picked it up by himself. On 3 January 1948 ‚Äì while still at the Academy ‚Äì Martin married Sheena Chisholm, with whom he would have two children, Alexis and Gregory Paul Martin. He later married Judy Lockhart-Smith on 24 June 1966, and they also had two children, Lucie and Giles Martin.George Martin's Biography musicianguide.com. Retrieved: 23 September 2007 =Parlophone= The Beatles' first LP (produced by Martin) Following his graduation, he worked for the BBC's classical music department, then joined EMI in 1950 as an assistant to Oscar Preuss, the head of EMI's Parlophone Records from 1950 to 1955. Although having been regarded by EMI as a vital German imprint in the past, it was then not taken seriously and only used for EMI's insignificant acts. After taking over Parlophone, as head of artists and repertoire, when Preuss retired in 1955, Martin recorded classical and Baroque music, original cast recordings, and regional music from around Britain and Ireland. Martin also produced numerous comedy and novelty records. His first success for Parlophone was the \\"Mock Mozart\\" single, performed by Peter Ustinov with Antony Hopkins ‚Äì a record reluctantly released in 1952 by EMI, only after Preuss insisted they give his young assistant, Martin, a chance. Later that decade, Martin worked with Peter Sellers on two very popular comedy LPs. One was released on 10\\" format and called The Best Of Sellers, the second was released in 1957, being called Songs for Swinging Sellers (a spoof on Frank Sinatra's LP Songs for Swingin' Lovers!). As he had worked with Sellers, he also came to know Spike Milligan, with whom he became a firm friend, and best man at Milligan's second marriage: \\"I loved The Goon Show, and issued an album of it on my label Parlophone, which is how I got to know Spike.\\" The album was Bridge on the River Wye. It was a spoof of the film The Bridge on the River Kwai, being based on the 1957 Goon Show episode \\"An African Incident.\\" It was intended to have the same name as the film, but shortly before its release, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Martin edited out the 'K' every time the word Kwai was spoken, with Bridge on the River Wye being the result. The River Wye is a river that runs through England and Wales. The album featured Milligan, Sellers, Jonathan Miller, and Peter Cook, playing various characters.Lewis(1995) pp205‚Äì206 Other comedians Martin worked with included Bernard Cribbins, Charlie Drake, Terry Scott, Bruce Forsyth, Michael Bentine, Dudley Moore, Flanders and Swann, Lance Percival, Joan Sims, Bill Oddie, and The Alberts. Martin worked with both Jim Dale and the Vipers Skiffle Group, with whom he had a number of hits. In early 1962, under the pseudonym \\"Ray Cathode,\\" Martin released an early electronic dance single, \\"Time Beat\\" ‚Äì recorded at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. As Martin wanted to add rock and roll to Parlophone's repertoire, he struggled to find a \\"fireproof\\" hit-making pop artist or group. As a producer, Martin recorded the two-man show featuring Michael Flanders and Donald Swann, At the Drop of a Hat, which sold steadily for twenty-five years, although Martin's breakthrough as a producer came with the Beyond the Fringe show cast album, which starred Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, and Jonathan Miller, and he would also produce the accompanying soundtrack album for David Frost's satirical BBC TV show That Was the Week That Was in 1963. Martin's work transformed the profile of Parlophone from a \\"sad little company\\" to a very profitable business. The Beatles Martin working with the Beatles in a studio during Beatles for Sale sessions, 1964 Martin was contacted by Sid Coleman of Ardmore & Beechwood, who told him about Brian Epstein, the manager of a band whom he had met. He thought Martin might be interested in the group, even though they had been turned down by Decca Records. Until that time, although there had been considerable success with comedy records, and a number 1 hit with the Temperance Seven, Martin had only minor success with pop music, such as \\"Who Could Be Bluer\\" by Jerry Lordan, and singles with Shane Fenton and Matt Monro. After the telephone call by Coleman, Martin arranged a meeting on 13 February 1962 with Brian Epstein. Martin listened to a tape recorded at Decca, and thought that Epstein's group was \\"rather unpromising\\", but liked the sound of Lennon's and McCartney's vocals.Spitz (2005) p. 301 After another meeting with Epstein on 9 May at EMI Studios in London, Martin was impressed by Epstein's enthusiasm and agreed to sign the unknown Beatles to a recording contract, without having met them or seen them play live. The contract was not what it seemed, however, as Martin would not sign it himself until he had heard an audition, and later said that EMI had \\"nothing to lose,\\" as it offered one penny for each record sold, which was split among the four members. Martin suggested to EMI (after the release of \\"From Me to You\\") that the royalty rate should be doubled without asking for anything in return, which led to Martin being thought of as a \\"traitor in EMI\\". The Beatles auditioned for Martin on 6 June 1962, in studio three at EMI. Ron Richards and his engineer Norman Smith recorded four songs, which Martin (who was not present during the recording) listened to at the end of the session. The verdict was not promising, however, as Richards complained about Pete Best's drumming, and Martin thought their original songs were simply not good enough. Martin asked the individual Beatles if there was anything they personally did not like, to which George Harrison replied, \\"I don't like your tie.\\" That was the turning point, according to Smith, as John Lennon and Paul McCartney joined in with jokes and comic wordplay, that made Martin think that he should sign them to a contract for their wit alone. The Beatles' second recording session with Martin was on 4 September 1962, when they recorded \\"How Do You Do It\\", heavily modified by The Beatles which Martin thought was a sure-fire hit, even though Lennon and McCartney did not want to release it, not being one of their own compositions or style. Martin was correct: Gerry & the Pacemakers' version, which Martin produced, spent three weeks at No. 1 in April 1963, before being displaced by the Beatles' \\"From Me to You\\". On 11 September 1962, the Beatles re-recorded \\"Love Me Do\\" with session player Andy White playing drums. Ringo Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas, and although he complied, he was definitely \\"not pleased\\". Due to an EMI library error, a 4 September version with Starr playing drums was issued on the British single release; afterwards, the tape was destroyed, and the 11 September recording with Andy White on drums was used for all subsequent releases.Lewisohn, Mark (1988). The Beatles Recording Sessions. New York: Harmony Books. Martin would later praise Starr's drumming, calling him \\"probably ... the finest rock drummer in the world today\\". As \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number 17 in the British charts, on 26 November 1962 Martin recorded \\"Please Please Me\\", which he did only after Lennon and McCartney had almost begged him to record another of their original songs. Martin's crucial contribution to the song was to tell them to speed up what was initially a slow ballad. After the recording Martin looked over the mixing desk and said, \\"Gentlemen, you have just made your first number one record\\".\\"Congratulations, gentlemen, you've just made your first number one.\\" bbc.co.uk. Retrieved: 21 September 2007. Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher, as Ardmore & Beechwood had done nothing to promote \\"Love Me Do\\", informing Epstein of three publishers who, in Martin's opinion, would be fair and honest, which led them to Dick James. =As an arranger= Abbey Road Studios, where Martin recorded Parlophone's artists Martin's formal musical expertise helped fill the gaps between the Beatles' unrefined talent and the sound which distinguished them from other groups, which eventually made them successful. Most of the Beatles' orchestral arrangements and instrumentation were written or performed by Martin, as well as frequent keyboard parts on the early records, in collaboration with the less musically experienced band. It was Martin's idea to score a string quartet accompaniment for \\"Yesterday\\" against McCartney's initial reluctance.\\"What about a classical string quartet?\\" bbc.co.uk. Retrieved: 21 September 2007 Martin played the song in the style of Bach to show McCartney the voicings that were available. Another example is the song \\"Penny Lane\\", which featured a piccolo trumpet solo that was requested by McCartney after hearing the instrument on a BBC broadcast. McCartney hummed the melody that he wanted, and Martin notated it for David Mason, the classically trained trumpeter. Martin's work as an arranger was used for many Beatles recordings. For \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" he scored and conducted a strings-only accompaniment inspired by Bernard Herrmann. On a Canadian speaking tour in 2007, Martin said that his \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" score was influenced by Herrmann's score for the Alfred Hitchcock thriller Psycho.MacDonald (1994) p163 For \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", he and recording engineer Geoff Emerick turned two very different takes into a single master through careful use of vari-speed and editing. For \\"I Am the Walrus\\", he provided a quirky and original arrangement for brass, violins, cellos, and the Mike Sammes Singers vocal ensemble.MacDonald (1994) p216 On \\"In My Life\\", he played a speeded-up baroque piano solo. He worked with McCartney to implement the orchestral climax in \\"A Day in the Life\\", and he and McCartney shared conducting duties the day that it was recorded. Martin contributed integral parts to other songs, including the piano in \\"Lovely Rita\\",MacDonald (1994) pp189‚Äì190 the harpsichord in songs such as \\"Because\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\"; the old steam organ and tape loop arrangement that created the Pablo Fanque circus atmosphere that Lennon requested on \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" (both Martin and Lennon played steam organ parts for this song), and the orchestration in \\"Good Night\\". The first song that Martin did not arrange was \\"She's Leaving Home\\", as he had a prior engagement to produce a Cilla Black session, so McCartney contacted arranger Mike Leander to do it. Martin was reportedly hurt by this, but still produced the recording and conducted the orchestra himself. Martin was in demand as an independent arranger and producer by the time of the band's 1968 self-titled double album (also known as the \\"White Album\\"), so the Beatles were left to produce various tracks by themselves. Martin composed and arranged the score for the Beatles' film Yellow Submarine and the James Bond film Live and Let Die, for which Paul McCartney wrote and sang the title song. He helped arrange Paul and Linda McCartney's American number 1 single \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\". Paul McCartney once commended Martin by saying: \\"George Martin [was] quite experimental for who he was, a grown-up.\\" =Film and composing work= Beginning in the late 1950s, Martin began to supplement his producer income by publishing music and having his artists record it. He used the pseudonyms Lezlo Anales and John Chisholm, before settling on Graham Fisher as his primary pseudonym. Martin composed, arranged, and produced film scores since the early 1960s, including the instrumental scores of the films A Hard Day's Night (1964, for which he won an Academy Award Nomination), Ferry Cross the Mersey (1965), Yellow Submarine (1968), and Live and Let Die (1973). Other notable movie scores include Crooks Anonymous (1962), The Family Way (1966), Pulp (1972, starring Michael Caine and Mickey Rooney), the Peter Sellers film The Optimists of Nine Elms (1973), and the John Schlesinger-directed Honky Tonk Freeway (1981). Martin was also commissioned to write an official opening theme for BBC Radio 1's launch in September 1967. Entitled \\"Theme One\\", it was the first music heard on Radio 1 (not The Move's \\"Flowers in the Rain\\", which was the first record played in full on the station). The tune was later covered by the British progressive rock group Van der Graaf Generator. In November 2017, the Craig Leon-produced album George Martin ‚Äì Film Scores and Original Orchestral Music was released. The album of new recordings collected a selection of Martin's compositions together for the first time, including previously unheard pieces Belle Etoile and sketches from the feature film The Mission (1986) which were not used in the original soundtrack. =The Beatles Anthology= Martin oversaw post-production on The Beatles Anthology (which was originally entitled The Long and Winding Road) in 1994 and 1995, working again with Geoff Emerick.\\"The Beatles Anthology\\" DVD 2003 (Special Features‚ÄîCompiling The Anthology Albums‚Äî0:00:10) George Martin talking about The Anthology project. Martin decided to use an old 8-track analogue mixing console ‚Äì which EMI learned an engineer still had ‚Äì to mix the songs for the project, instead of a modern digital console.

By 1965, the Beatles' success had given Martin the leverage to start Associated Independent Recording (AIR), which enabled him to hire out his services to other artists. Martin also took EMI's best producers and staff along with him to AIR. AIR demonstrated how important Martin's talents were to his artists, and it allowed him a share in record royalties on his hits.

Released in March 1991 for use with the LC family, Apple targeted the card at its widely dominated educational market to ease the transition from Apple II-based classrooms, with thousands of entrenched educational software titles, to Macintosh-based classrooms.  Features  Apple asked the media to call the peripheral the \\"Apple IIe option board\\", as earlier \\"emulator\\" cards were not successful. Like the Apple IIe itself, the Apple IIe Card uses an onboard 65C02 CPU. The CPU is software-configurable to run at the Apple IIe's native 1.0 MHz speed or at an accelerated 1.9 MHz. Video emulation (text and graphics) is handled through software using native Macintosh QuickDraw routines, which often results in operations being slower than a real Apple IIe except on higher-end machines. Any Macintosh that supports the card can be switched into 560√ó384 resolution for better compatibility with the IIe's 280√ó192 color High-Resolution graphics (essentially doubled in both directions on the Macintosh) and 560x192 monochrome double-high-rez/80 column text mode (doubled horizontally), using the card's onboard 17.234mhz oscillator in place of the usual video clock thanks to the local bus nature of the PDS slot. This was particularly applicable to the Color Classic which is otherwise fixed at 512√ó384 resolution; the monitor scan rate remains the same, but horizontal pixel density (and total pixel clocks per scanline) is increased by 10% to fit the greater resolution in the same width. The IIe card has 256K RAM; half is used to emulate the Extended 80-Column Text Card's 128K of memory, and half stores the IIe's ROM. Macworld reported that because Apple IIGS engineers helped design the IIe Card, all copy-protected and other software except for \\"a few very esoteric games\\" are compatible. The host Macintosh emulates or provides native access to many of the expansion cards and peripherals one might install in a bare Apple IIe. These services provided to the IIe card makes the simultaneous running of the host's System 7 impossible. Hardware services include a 1.44 MB 3.5\\" SuperDrive, mouse, 1 MB RAM, 80-column text and graphical monochrome or color display, clock, numeric keypad, two hardware serial ports (in addition to the emulated serial necessary for the IIe mouse), SCSI hard drive, and AppleShare file server. An included \\"Y-cable\\" enables the attachment of up to two external 140 KB floppy disk 5.25\\" Drives, an 800 KB \\"intelligent\\" 3.5\\" UniDisk drive, and a joystick or paddle control for use with the Apple IIe emulator. 800 KB 3.5\\" Drive and 1.44 MB SuperDrives are not recognized when attached via the Y-cable due to the Disk Controller on the IIe card lacking support. (chip labeled U1A located in zone A1 of card ‚Äì lower left as pictured above) The product included an owner's manual, Y-cable, and two disks: the Apple IIe installer disk and the Apple IIe card startup disk. 2.2.2d1 is the latest version of the startup disk. Version 2.2.1 and a patch to reach 2.2.2d1 are available at Apple Support Area. Reception Apple claimed that the LC helped the company regain educational market share lost to inexpensive PC clones. , about half of the LCs sold to schools used the IIe Card.  Technical specifications  * LSI Logic Mega II (\\"Gemini\\" chip); a complete Apple IIe on a single microcircuit ‚Äì minus RAM, firmware and CPU * IWM (Integrated Woz Machine) for floppy control functions * 256 KB RAM built- in (128 KB for Apple II memory, 128 KB reserved for Macintosh) * 65C02 processor running at either 1.023 MHz or 1.9 MHz * High-density 26-pin connector with \\"Y-cable\\" supports joystick/paddles and two Apple 5.25\\" or UniDisk 3.5\\" floppy disk drives * Ability to access up to 1 MB of native Macintosh RAM * All Apple IIe text and video modes supported, via QuickDraw software emulation Notes: When emulating the Apple IIe, only a full-screen mode is available and all native Macintosh functions are suspended while running (a proprietary graphical control panel, running outside MacOS, is available for configuring the virtual Apple II slots and peripherals; however, both native and emulated computer function are suspended during this activity). Macintosh functions and control resume only once emulation is completely shut down and exited.  Host system compatibility  The card plugs into the PDS slot in many of the LC-series Macintoshes, but not all models and system software combinations are supported. Apple's Tech Info Library article #8458 lists the following models as Apple IIe Card-compatible: Color Classic, Colour Classic II, LC, LC II, III & III+; LC 475, 520, 550, 575; Quadra 605 and Performa 4XX, 52X, 55X, 56X, and 57X. However, other models that have an LC-compatible PDS slot and support 24-bit memory addressing are compatible with the Apple IIe Card but are not officially supported. Systems 7.0 through 7.5.5 support both 24- and 32-bit addressing on suitable Macintosh models. (From System 7.6 onwards, Macintosh system software does not support 24-bit addressing.) To enable 24-bit addressing on supported systems, use the Macintosh Memory control panel.

The word is often used to refer to a preconceived, usually unfavourable, evaluation of another person based on that person's political affiliation, sex, gender, beliefs, values, social class, age, disability, religion, sexuality, race, ethnicity, language, nationality, beauty, occupation, education, criminality, sport team affiliation or other personal characteristics.Dovidio, J. F., & Gaertner. S. L. (2010). \\"Intergroup bias\\". In S. T. Fiske, D. T. Gilbert, & G. Lindzey (Eds.), The Handbook of Social Psychology (5th ed., Vol. 2). New York: Wiley. Prejudice can also refer to unfounded or pigeonholed beliefsWilliam James wrote: \\"A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.\\" Quotable Quotes ‚Äì Courtesy of The Freeman Institute and it may include \\"any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence\\". Gordon Allport defined prejudice as a \\"feeling, favorable or unfavorable, toward a person or thing, prior to, or not based on, actual experience\\". Auestad (2015) defines prejudice as characterized by 'symbolic transfer', transfer of a value-laden meaning content onto a socially formed category and then on to individuals who are taken to belong to that category, resistance to change, and overgeneralization. Historical approaches The first psychological research conducted on prejudice occurred in the 1920s. This research attempted to prove white supremacy. One article from 1925 which reviewed 73 studies on race concluded that the studies seemed \\"to indicate the mental superiority of the white race\\". These studies, along with other research, led many psychologists to view prejudice as a natural response to inferior races. In the 1930s and 1940s, this perspective began to change due to the increasing concern about anti-Semitism due to the ideology of the Nazis. At the time, theorists viewed prejudice as pathological and they thus looked for personality syndromes linked with racism. Theodor Adorno believed that prejudice stemmed from an authoritarian personality; he believed that people with authoritarian personalities were the most likely to be prejudiced against groups of lower status. He described authoritarians as \\"rigid thinkers who obeyed authority, saw the world as black and white, and enforced strict adherence to social rules and hierarchies\\".Plous, S. \\"The Psychology of Prejudice\\". Understanding Prejudice.org. Web. 07 Apr. 2011. In 1954, Gordon Allport, in his classic work The Nature of Prejudice, linked prejudice to categorical thinking. Allport claimed that prejudice is a natural and normal process for humans. According to him, \\"The human mind must think with the aid of categories‚Ä¶ Once formed, categories are the basis for normal prejudgment. We cannot possibly avoid this process. Orderly living depends upon it.\\"Allport, G. W. (1954). The Nature of Prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. In the 1970s, research began to show that prejudice tends to be based on favoritism towards one's own groups, rather than negative feelings towards another group. According to Marilyn Brewer, prejudice \\"may develop not because outgroups are hated, but because positive emotions such as admiration, sympathy, and trust are reserved for the ingroup.\\" In 1979, Thomas Pettigrew described the ultimate attribution error and its role in prejudice. The ultimate attribution error occurs when ingroup members \\"(1) attribute negative outgroup behavior to dispositional causes (more than they would for identical ingroup behavior), and (2) attribute positive outgroup behavior to one or more of the following causes: (a) a fluke or exceptional case, (b) luck or special advantage, (c) high motivation and effort, and (d) situational factors.\\" Youeng-Bruehl (1996) argued that prejudice cannot be treated in the singular; one should rather speak of different prejudices as characteristic of different character types. Her theory defines prejudices as being social defences, distinguishing between an obsessional character structure, primarily linked with anti-semitism, hysterical characters, primarily associated with racism, and narcissistic characters, linked with sexism. Contemporary theories and empirical findings The out-group homogeneity effect is the perception that members of an out-group are more similar (homogenous) than members of the in-group. Social psychologists Quattrone and Jones conducted a study demonstrating this with students from the rival schools Princeton University and Rutgers University. Students at each school were shown videos of other students from each school choosing a type of music to listen to for an auditory perception study. Then the participants were asked to guess what percentage of the videotaped students' classmates would choose the same. Participants predicted a much greater similarity between out-group members (the rival school) than between members of their in-group. The justification-suppression model of prejudice was created by Christian Crandall and Amy Eshleman. This model explains that people face a conflict between the desire to express prejudice and the desire to maintain a positive self-concept. This conflict causes people to search for justification for disliking an out-group, and to use that justification to avoid negative feelings (cognitive dissonance) about themselves when they act on their dislike of the out-group. The realistic conflict theory states that competition between limited resources leads to increased negative prejudices and discrimination. This can be seen even when the resource is insignificant. In the Robber's Cave experiment, negative prejudice and hostility was created between two summer camps after sports competitions for small prizes. The hostility was lessened after the two competing camps were forced to cooperate on tasks to achieve a common goal. Another contemporary theory is the integrated threat theory (ITT), which was developed by Walter G Stephan. It draws from and builds upon several other psychological explanations of prejudice and ingroup/outgroup behaviour, such as the realistic conflict theory and symbolic racism. It also uses the social identity theory perspective as the basis for its validity; that is, it assumes that individuals operate in a group-based context where group memberships form a part of individual identity. ITT posits that outgroup prejudice and discrimination is caused when individuals perceive an outgroup to be threatening in some way. ITT defines four threats: * Realistic threats * Symbolic threats * Intergroup anxiety * Negative stereotypes Realistic threats are tangible, such as competition for a natural resource or a threat to income. Symbolic threats arise from a perceived difference in cultural values between groups or a perceived imbalance of power (for example, an ingroup perceiving an outgroup's religion as incompatible with theirs). Intergroup anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness experienced in the presence of an outgroup or outgroup member, which constitutes a threat because interactions with other groups cause negative feelings (e.g., a threat to comfortable interactions). Negative stereotypes are similarly threats, in that individuals anticipate negative behaviour from outgroup members in line with the perceived stereotype (for example, that the outgroup is violent). Often these stereotypes are associated with emotions such as fear and anger. ITT differs from other threat theories by including intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes as threat types. Additionally, social dominance theory states that society can be viewed as group-based hierarchies. In competition for scarce resources such as housing or employment, dominant groups create prejudiced \\"legitimizing myths\\" to provide moral and intellectual justification for their dominant position over other groups and validate their claim over the limited resources. Legitimizing myths, such as discriminatory hiring practices or biased merit norms, work to maintain these prejudiced hierarchies. Prejudice can be a central contributing factor to depression. This can occur in someone who is a prejudice victim, being the target of someone else's prejudice, or when people have prejudice against themselves that causes their own depression. Paul Bloom argues that while prejudice can be irrational and have terrible consequences, it is natural and often quite rational. This is because prejudices are based on the human tendency to categorise objects and people based on prior experience. This means people make predictions about things in a category based on prior experience with that category, with the resulting predictions usually being accurate (though not always). Bloom argues that this process of categorisation and prediction is necessary for survival and normal interaction, quoting William Hazlitt, who stated \\"Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way my across the room; nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances, nor what to feel in any relation of life\\".Bloom, Paul \\"Can prejudice ever be a good thing\\" January 2014, accessed 02/12/17 In recent years, researchers have argued that the study of prejudice has been traditionally too narrow. It is argued that since prejudice is defined as a negative affect towards members of a group, there are many groups against whom prejudice is acceptable (such as rapists, men who abandon their families, pedophiles, neo-Nazis, drink-drivers, queue jumpers, murderers etc.), yet such prejudices aren't studied. It has been suggested that researchers have focused too much on an evaluative approach to prejudice, rather than a descriptive approach, which looks at the actual psychological mechanisms behind prejudiced attitudes. It is argued that this limits research to targets of prejudice to groups deemed to be receiving unjust treatment, while groups researchers deem treated justly or deservedly of prejudice are overlooked. As a result, the scope of prejudice has begun to expand in research, allowing a more accurate analysis of the relationship between psychological traits and prejudice.Crawford, Jarret, and Mark J. Brandt. 2018. ‚ÄúBig Five Traits and Inclusive Generalized Prejudice.‚Äù PsyArXiv. June 30. doi:10.31234/osf.io/6vqwk.Brandt, Mark, and J. T.

Grace.\\"Prejudice is about Collective Values, not a Biased Psychological System.\\" Editor‚Äôs Introduction 48, no. 1 (2019): 15. Controversies and prominent topics One can be prejudiced against or have a preconceived notion about someone due to any characteristic they find to be unusual or undesirable. A few commonplace examples of prejudice are those based on someone's race, gender, nationality, social status, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation, and controversies may arise from any given topic. =Sexism= Sexism, also called gender discrimination, is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender. Sexism can affect either gender, but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls more often.There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism usually refers to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example: * Defines sexism as \\"prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.\\" * Defines sexism as \\"prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls.\\" Notes that \\"sexism in a society is most commonly applied against women and girls. It functions to maintain patriarchy, or male domination, through ideological and material practices of individuals, collectives, and institutions that oppress women and girls on the basis of sex or gender.\\" * Notes that \\"'Sexism' refers to a historically and globally pervasive form of oppression against women.\\" * Notes that \\"sexism usually refers to prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls.\\" Also states that \\"sexism is an ideology or practices that maintain patriarchy or male domination.\\" * Defines sexism as \\"thought or practice which may permeate language and which assume's women's inferiority to men.\\" * Defines sexism as \\"any devaluation or denigration of women or men, but particularly women, which is embodied in institutions and social relationships.\\" * Notes that \\"either sex may be the object of sexist attitudes... however, it is commonly held that, in developed societies, women have been the usual victims.\\" * \\"Sexism is any act, attitude, or institutional configuration that systematically subordinates or devalues women. Built upon the belief that men and women are constitutionally different, sexism takes these differences as indications that men are inherently superior to women, which then is used to justify the nearly universal dominance of men in social and familial relationships, as well as politics, religion, language, law, and economics.\\" * Notes that \\"both men and women can experience sexism, but sexism against women is more pervasive.\\" * Suggests that \\"the key test of whether something is sexist... lies in its consequences: if it supports male privilege, then it is by definition sexist. I specify 'male privilege' because in every known society where gender inequality exists, males are privileged over females.\\" * Notes that \\"although we speak of gender inequality, it is usually women who are disadvantaged relative to similarly situated men.\\" * \\"As throughout history, today women are the primary victims of sexism, prejudice directed at one sex, even in the United States.\\" The discussion of such sentiments, and actual gender differences and stereotypes continue to be controversial topics. Throughout history, women have been thought of as being subordinate to men, often being ignored in areas like the academia or belittled altogether. Traditionally, men were thought of as being more capable than women, mentally and physically.Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. On the Nature of Prejudice. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 108. Print. In the field of social psychology, prejudice studies like the \\"Who Likes Competent Women\\" study led the way for gender-based research on prejudice. This resulted in two broad themes or focuses in the field: the first being a focus on attitudes toward gender equality, and the second focusing on people's beliefs about men and women. Today, studies based on sexism continue in the field of psychology as researchers try to understand how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors influence and are influenced by others. =Nationalism= Nationalism is a sentiment based on common cultural characteristics that binds a population and often produces a policy of national independence or separatism.\\"Nationalism\\", dictionary.com It suggests a \\"shared identity\\" amongst a nation's people that minimizes differences within the group and emphasizes perceived boundaries between the group and non-members. This leads to the assumption that members of the nation have more in common than they actually do, that they are \\"culturally unified\\", even if injustices within the nation based on differences like status and race exist. During times of conflict between one nation and another, nationalism is controversial since it may function as a buffer for criticism when it comes to the nation's own problems since it makes the nation's own hierarchies and internal conflicts appear to be natural. It may also serve a way of rallying the people of the nation in support of a particular political goal. Nationalism usually involves a push for conformity, obedience, and solidarity amongst the nation's people and can result not only in feelings of public responsibility but also in a narrow sense of community due to the exclusion of those who are considered outsiders. Since the identity of nationalists is linked to their allegiance to the state, the presence of strangers who do not share this allegiance may result in hostility. =Classism= Classism is defined by dictionary.com as \\"a biased or discriminatory attitude on distinctions made between social or economic classes.\\"\\"Classism\\", dictionary.com The idea of separating people based on class is controversial in itself. Some argue that economic inequality is an unavoidable aspect of society, so there will always be a ruling class.Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 145. Print. Some also argue that, even within the most egalitarian societies in history, some form of ranking based on social status takes place. Therefore, one may believe the existence of social classes is a natural feature of society.Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 146. Print. Others argue the contrary. According to anthropological evidence, for the majority of the time the human species has been in existence, humans have lived in a manner in which the land and resources were not privately owned. Also, when social ranking did occur, it was not antagonistic or hostile like the current class system. This evidence has been used to support the idea that the existence of a social class system is unnecessary. Overall, society has neither come to a consensus over the necessity of the class system, nor been able to deal with the hostility and prejudice that occurs because of the class system. =Sexual discrimination= One's sexual orientation is the \\"direction of one's sexual interest toward members of the same, opposite, or both sexes\\".\\"Sexual Orientation\\", dictionary.com Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are not immune to prejudice or stereotypes from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences; a term for such intense hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is homophobia. Due to what social psychologists call the vividness effect, a tendency to notice only certain distinctive characteristics, the majority population tends to draw conclusions like gays flaunt their sexuality.Anderson, Kristin. Benign Bigotry: The Psychology of Subtle Prejudice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. 198. Print. Such images may be easily recalled to mind due to their vividness, making it harder to appraise the entire situation. The majority population may not only think that homosexuals flaunt their sexuality or are \\"too gay\\", but may also erroneously believe that homosexuals are easy to identify and label as being gay or lesbian when compared to others who are not homosexual.Anderson, Kristin. Benign Bigotry: The Psychology of Subtle Prejudice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. 200. Print. The idea of heterosexual privilege seems to flourish in society. Research and questionnaires are formulated to fit the majority; i.e., heterosexuals. This discussion of whether heterosexuals are the privileged group and whether homosexuals are a minimized group is controversial. Research shows that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a powerful feature of many labor markets. For example, controlling for human capital, studies show that gay men earn 10% - 32% less than heterosexual men in the United States, and that there is significant discrimination in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation in many labor markets. =Racism= Racism is defined as the belief that physical characteristics determine cultural traits, and that racial characteristics make some groups superior.Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 37‚Äì38. Print. By separating people into hierarchies based upon their race, it has been argued that unequal treatment among the different groups of people is just and fair due to their genetic differences. Racism can occur amongst any group that can be identified based upon physical features or even characteristics of their culture. Though people may be lumped together and called a specific race, everyone does not fit neatly into such categories, making it hard to define and describe a race accurately. Scientific racism began to flourish in the eighteenth century and was greatly influenced by Charles Darwin's evolutionary studies, as well as ideas taken from the writings of philosophers like Aristotle; for example, Aristotle believed in the concept of \\"natural slaves\\". This concept focuses on the necessity of hierarchies and how some people are bound to be on the bottom of the pyramid. Though racism has been a prominent topic in history, there is still debate over whether race actually exists, making the discussion of race a controversial topic. Even though the concept of race is still being debated, the effects of racism are apparent. Racism and other forms of prejudice can affect a person's behavior, thoughts, and feelings, and social psychologists strive to study these effects. =Religious discrimination= While various religions teach their members to be tolerant of those who are different and to have compassion, throughout history there have been wars, pogroms and other forms of violence motivated by hatred of religious groups.Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. On the Nature of Prejudice. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 413. Print. In the modern world, researchers in western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic countries have done various studies exploring the relationship between religion and prejudice; thus far, they have received mixed results. A study done with US college students found that those who reported religion to be very influential in their lives seem to have a higher rate of prejudice than those who reported not being religious. Other studies found that religion has a positive effect on people as far as prejudice is concerned. This difference in results may be attributed to the differences in religious practices or religious interpretations amongst the individuals. Those who practice \\"institutionalized religion\\", which focuses more on social and political aspects of religious events, are more likely to have an increase in prejudice.Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. On the Nature of Prejudice. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 414. Print. Those who practice \\"interiorized religion\\", in which believers devote themselves to their beliefs, are most likely to have a decrease in prejudice. =Linguistic discrimination= Individuals or groups may be treated unfairly based solely on their use of language. This use of language may include the individual's native language or other characteristics of the person's speech, such as an accent, the size of vocabulary (whether the person uses complex and varied words), and syntax. It may also involve a person's ability or inability to use one language instead of another. In the mid-1980s, linguist Tove Skutnabb-Kangas captured this idea of discrimination based on language as the concept of linguicism. Kangas defined linguicism as the ideologies and structures used to \\"legitimate, effectuate, and reproduce unequal division of power and resources (both material and non-material) between groups which are defined on the basis of language.\\"Quoted in Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, and Phillipson, Robert, Mother Tongue': The Theoretical and Sociopolitical Construction of a Concept\\". In Ammon, Ulrich (ed.) (1989), Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties, p. 455. Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter & Co. . =Neurological discrimination= Broadly speaking, attribution of low social status to those who do not conform to neurotypical expectations of personality and behaviour. This can manifest through assumption of 'disability' status to those who are high functioning enough to exist outside of diagnostic criteria, yet do not desire to (or are unable to) conform their behaviour to conventional patterns. This is a controversial and somewhat contemporary concept; with various disciplinary approaches promoting conflicting messages what normality constitutes, the degree of acceptable individual difference within that category, and the precise criteria for what constitutes medical disorder. This has been most prominent in the case of high-functioning autism,NeuroTribes: The legacy of autism and how to think smarter about people who think differently. Allen & Unwin. Print. where direct cognitive benefits increasingly appear to come at the expense of social intelligence. Discrimination may also extend to other high functioning individuals carrying pathological phenotypes, such as those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar spectrum disorders. In these cases, there are indications that perceived (or actual) socially disadvantageous cognitive traits are directly correlated with advantageous cognitive traits in other domains, notably creativity and divergent thinking, and yet these strengths might become systematically overlooked. The case for \\"neurological discrimination\\" as such lies in the expectation that one's professional capacity may be judged by the quality of ones social interaction, which can in such cases be an inaccurate and discriminatory metric for employment suitability. Since there are moves by some experts to have these higher- functioning extremes reclassified as extensions of human personality, any legitimisation of discrimination against these groups would fit the very definition of prejudice, as medical validation for such discrimination becomes redundant. Recent advancements in behavioural genetics and neuroscience have made this a very relevant issue of discussion, with existing frameworks requiring significant overhaul to accommodate the strength of findings over the last decade. Multiculturalism Humans have an evolved propensity to think categorically about social groups, manifested in cognitive processes with broad implications for public and political endorsement of multicultural policy, according to psychologists Richard J. Crisp and Rose Meleady. They postulated a cognitive-evolutionary account of human adaptation to social diversity that explains general resistance to multiculturalism, and offer a reorienting call for scholars and policy-makers who seek intervention-based solutions to the problem of prejudice. Reducing prejudice =The contact hypothesis= The contact hypothesis predicts that prejudice can only be reduced when in-group and out-group members are brought together.Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., & Akert, R. M. (2010). Social Psychology (7th edition). New York: Pearson. In particular, there are six conditions that must be met to reduce prejudice, as were cultivated in Elliot Aronson's \\"jigsaw\\" teaching technique. First, the in- and out-groups must have a degree of mutual interdependence. Second, both groups need to share a common goal. Third, the two groups must have equal status. Fourth, there must be frequent opportunities for informal and interpersonal contact between groups. Fifth, there should be multiple contacts between the in- and the out-groups. Finally, social norms of equality must exist and be present to foster prejudice reduction. =Empirical research= Academics Thomas Pettigrew and Linda Tropp conducted a meta-analysis of 515 studies involving a quarter of a million participants in 38 nations to examine how intergroup contact reduces prejudice. They found that three mediators are of particular importance: Intergroup contact reduces prejudice by (1) enhancing knowledge about the outgroup, (2) reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and (3) increasing empathy and perspective-taking. While all three of these mediators had mediational effects, the mediational value of increased knowledge was less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy. In addition, some individuals confront discrimination when they see it happen, with research finding that individuals are more likely to confront when they perceive benefits to themselves, and are less likely to confront when concerned about others' reactions.

It has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider British cuisine, partly through the importation of ingredients and ideas from the Americas, China, and India during the time of the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration. Some traditional meals, such as bread and cheese, roasted and stewed meats, meat and game pies, boiled vegetables and broths, and freshwater and saltwater fish have ancient origins. The 14th- century English cookbook, the Forme of Cury, contains recipes for these, and dates from the royal court of Richard II. English cooking has been influenced by foreign ingredients and cooking styles since the Middle Ages. Curry was introduced from the Indian subcontinent and adapted to English tastes from the eighteenth century with Hannah Glasse's recipe for chicken \\"currey\\". French cuisine influenced English recipes throughout the Victorian era. After the rationing of the Second World War, Elizabeth David's 1950 A Book of Mediterranean Food had wide influence, bringing Italian cuisine to English homes. Her success encouraged other cookery writers to describe other styles, including Chinese and Thai cuisine. England continues to absorb culinary ideas from all over the world. History Recipes from The Forme of Cury for \\"drepee\\", parboiled birds with almonds and fried onions, and \\"mawmenee\\", a sweet stew of capon or pheasant with cinnamon, ginger, cloves, dates and pine nuts, coloured with sandalwood, c. 1390 Meat was roasted in Hampton Court Palace in Tudor times, as re-enacted today, but English cookery included dishes of many other kinds. =Middle Ages= English cookery has developed over many centuries since at least the time of The Forme of Cury, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are described. It was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films. Instead, mediaeval dishes often had the texture of a pure√©, possibly containing small fragments of meat or fish: 48% of the recipes in the Beinecke manuscript are for dishes similar to stews or pure√©s. Such dishes could be broadly of three types: somewhat acid, with wine, vinegar, and spices in the sauce, thickened with bread; sweet and sour, with sugar and vinegar; and sweet, using then-expensive sugar. An example of such a sweet pure√© dish for meat (it could also be made with fish) from the Beinecke manuscript is the rich, saffron-yellow \\"Mortruys\\", thickened with egg: Another manuscript, Utilis Coquinario, mentions dishes such as \\"pyany\\", poultry garnished with peonies; \\"hyppee\\", a rose-hip broth; and birds such as cormorants and woodcocks. =Sixteenth century= The early modern period saw the gradual arrival of printed cookery books, though the very first, the printer Richard Pynson's 1500 Boke of Cokery was compiled from medieval texts. The next, A Proper Newe Booke of Cokerye, was published sometime after 1545. The Secretes of the Reverende Maister Alexis of Piermont was published in 1558, translated from a French translation of Alessio Piemontese's original Italian work on confectionery. The number of titles expanded rapidly towards the end of the century to include Thomas Dawson's The Good Huswifes Jewell in 1585, the Book of Cookrye by \\"A. W.\\" in 1591, and John Partridge's The Good Hous-wives Handmaide in 1594. These books were of two kinds: collections of so-called secrets on confectionery and health remedies, aimed at aristocratic ladies; and advice on cookery and how to manage a household, aimed at women from more ordinary backgrounds, most likely wives of minor aristocrats, clergymen, and professional men. Thomas Dawson's The Good Huswifes Jewell was first published in 1585. English tastes evolved during the sixteenth century in at least three ways. First, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Second, butter becomes an important ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Third, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. In A. W.'s Book of Cookrye, 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly thyme. On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar and dried fruit, together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: The Good Huswifes Jewell introduced sweet potatoes (from the tropical Americas) alongside familiar Medieval recipes. Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book, compiled in 1604 (and first published in 1986) gives an intimate view of Elizabethan cookery. The book provides recipes for various forms of bread, such as buttered loaves; for apple fritters; preserves and pickles; and a celebration cake for 100 people. New ingredients appear; a recipe for dressing a shoulder of mutton calls for the use of the newly- available citrus fruits: Pies have been an important part of English cooking from Tudor times to the present day. Pies were important both as food and for show; the nursery rhyme \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\", with its lines \\"Four and Twenty blackbirds / Baked in a pie. // When the pie was opened, The birds began to sing\\" refers to the conceit of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving at a banquet. =Seventeenth century= Robert May's The Accomplisht Cook, first published in 1660 The bestselling cookery book of the early seventeenth century was Gervase Markham's The English Huswife, published in 1615. It appears that his recipes were from the collection of a deceased noblewoman, and therefore dated back to Elizabethan times or earlier. Women were thus becoming both the authors of cookery books and their readers, though only about 10% of women in England were literate by 1640. Markham's recipes are distinctively different from mediaeval ones; three quarters of his sauces for meat and meat pies make use of a combination of sweet and sour, and he advises: Robert May's The Accomplisht Cook was published in 1660 when he was 72 years old. The book included a substantial number of recipes for soups and stews, 38 recipes for sturgeon, and a large number of pies variously containing fish (including sturgeon), meat (including battalia pie), and sweet fillings. French influence is evident in Hannah Woolley's The Cooks Guide, 1664. Her recipes are designed to enable her non-aristocratic readers to imitate the fashionable French style of cooking with elaborate sauces. She combined the use of \\"Claret wine\\" and anchovies with more traditional cooking ingredients such as sugar, dried fruit, and vinegar. =Eighteenth century= Tom King's Coffee House in William Hogarth's painting Four Times of the Day, 1738 John Nott's The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary (1723), still with rather few precedents to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its recipes, from Al to Zest. The book covered everything from soups and salads to meat and fish, as well as pastries of many kinds, confectionery, and the making of beer, cider, and wine. Bills of fare are given for each month of the year. James Woodforde's Diary of a Country Parson gives a good idea of the sort of food eaten in England in the eighteenth century by those who could afford to eat whatever they liked. To welcome some neighbours on 8 June 1781, he gave them for dinner: Another country clergyman, Gilbert White, in The Natural History of Selborne (1789) recorded the increased consumption of vegetables by ordinary country people in the south of England, to which, he noted, potatoes, from the Americas, had only been added during the reign of King George III: Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy was the best-selling cookery book for a century from its publication in 1747. It ran to at least 40 editions, and was widely pirated. =Nineteenth century= How English puddings should look, according to Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861 English cooking was systematized and made available to the middle classes by a series of popular books, their authors becoming household names. One of the first was Mrs Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, 1806; it went through sixty-seven editions by 1844, selling hundreds of thousands of copies in Britain and America. This was followed by Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families 1845, which Bee Wilson has called \\"the greatest cookery book in our language\\", but \\"modern\\" only in a nineteenth- century sense. An example recipe from Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families is her \\"Quince Blanc-Mange (Delicious)\\": Acton was supplanted by the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, substantially written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and recipes, to be looked up as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elm√© Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking for a series of aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people. Three of the major hot drinks popular in England, tea, coffee, and chocolate, originated from outside Europe and were already staple items by Victorian times. Catherine of Braganza brought the Portuguese habit of tea to England around 1660. Initially, its expense restricted it to wealthy consumers, but the price gradually dropped, until by the 19th century its use was widespread. Introduced in the 16th century, coffee became popular by the 17th century, especially in the coffee houses, the first opening in Oxford in 1650. Hot chocolate was a popular drink by the 17th century, long before it was used as a food. Chocolate bars were developed and marketed by three English Quaker- founded businesses, Joseph Fry's (1847), Rowntree's (1862), and Cadbury's (1868). =Twentieth century= After the First World War, many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships. Authors in the 1930s such as Lady SysonbySee drew on recipes from a wide range of countries. thumbuprightleftIssuing a family's weekly rations of bacon, margarine, butter, sugar, tea, and lard in 1943 Rationing was introduced in 1940 to cope with the shortages caused by the wartime blockade. Foods such as bananas, onions and chocolate became hard to find, while unfamiliar items such as dried egg, dried potato, whale meat, snook (a South African fish), and the tinned pork product Spam appeared in the national diet. Since butter, sugar, eggs and flour were all rationed, English dishes such as pies and cakes became hard to make from traditional recipes. Instead, foods such as carrots were used in many different dishes, their natural sugars providing sweetness in novel dishes like carrot fudge. The diet was less than enjoyable, but paradoxically, rationing meant that the population was healthier than ever before, and perhaps ever since. The Ministry of Food employed home economists such as Marguerite Patten to demonstrate how to cook economically. After the war, Patten became one of the first television cooks, and sold 17 million copies of her 170 books. Elizabeth David's 1950 A Book of Mediterranean Food changed English cooking with dishes such as ratatouille. Elizabeth David profoundly changed English cooking with her 1950 A Book of Mediterranean Food. Written at a time of scarcity, her book began with \\"perhaps the most evocative and inspirational passage in the history of British cookery writing\\": All five of David's early books remained in print half a century later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books paved the way for other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post- David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr (\\"the galloping gourmet\\"), and Robert Carrier. Stereotypes In 1953, Britain's first celebrity chef, Philip Harben, published Traditional Dishes of Britain. Its chapter titles simply listed \\"the stereotypical stalwarts of the British diet\\", from Cornish pasty and Yorkshire pudding to shortbread, Lancashire hotpot, steak and kidney pudding, jellied eels, clotted cream and fish and chips. Panayi noted that Harben began with contradictions and unsupported claims, naming Britain's supposed reputation for the worst food in the world, but claiming that the country's cooks were technically unmatched and that the repertoire of national dishes was the largest of any country's. The sociologist Bob Ashley observed that while people in Britain might agree that the core national diet consisted of items such as the full English breakfast, roast beef with all the trimmings, tea with scones, and fish and chips, few had ever eaten the canonical English breakfast, lunch and dinner in any single day, and many probably never ate any item from the list at all regularly. In any case, Ashley noted, the national diet changes with time, and cookery books routinely include dishes of foreign origin. He remarked that a National Trust caf√©, whose manager claimed \\"We're not allowed to do foreign food ... I can't do lasagne or anything like that\\", in fact served curry, because \\"seemingly curry is English\\". Anglo-Indian cuisine has indeed been part of the national diet since the eighteenth century. Many supposedly traditional English dishes are relatively new and can be dated to the century, and sometimes to the year, of their introduction. Thus piccalilli was introduced from India in the 18th century, as recorded by Hannah Glasse who gave a recipe for it in 1758. Conversely, dishes and sauces still considered foreign, such as fish in sweet and sour sauce, have been in English recipe books since the Middle Ages. Other dishes took their present form only gradually, as with the so-called \\"Full English breakfast\\". Breakfasts of this kind are indeed described in later editions of \\"Mrs Beeton\\", but as one of many variations. Thus her list of \\"Family Breakfasts for a Week in Winter\\" has for Wednesday something that looks fairly modern: \\"bread, muffins, butter, brawn, grilled bacon, boiled eggs\\"; but on other days less modern-looking breakfasts include mince, mutton cutlets, grilled kidneys, baked fresh herrings, and hash of cold game or poultry, while suggestions for \\"Family Breakfasts for a Week in Summer\\" included sardine toast, cold tongue, kedgeree and rissoles, and \\"Guests' Breakfast (Autumn)\\" included cold pheasant, game pie, and pressed beef.

The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration. The English celebrity cook Fanny Cradock asserted: \\"The English have never had a cuisine. Even Yorkshire pudding comes from Burgundy.\\" Nicola Humble observed that in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, there are about the same number of recipes from India as from Wales, Scotland and Ireland together. Panayi created controversy by asserting, with evidence, that fish and chips had foreign origins: the fried fish from Jewish cooking, the potato chips from France; the dish only came to signify national identity from about 1930. French cuisine powerfully influenced English cooking throughout the nineteenth century, and French celebrity chefs such as the Roux brothers and Raymond Blanc continue to do so in twenty-first-century England. =The role of Empire= Receipt To make a Currey the Indian Way from The Art of Cookery by Hannah Glasse, 1758, page 101 Curry was created by the arrival of the British in India in the seventeenth century, beginning as bowls of spicy sauce used, Lizzie Collingham writes, to add \\"bite to the rather bland flavours of boiled and roasted meats.\\" The 1758 edition of Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery contains what Clarissa Dickson Wright calls a \\"famous recipe\\" which describes how \\"To make a currey the Indian way\\"; it flavours chicken with onions fried in butter, the chicken being fried with turmeric, ginger and ground pepper, and stewed in its own stock with cream and lemon juice. Dickson Wright comments that she was \\"a bit sceptical\\" of this recipe, as it had few of the expected spices, but was \\"pleasantly surprised by the end result\\" which had \\"a very good and interesting flavour\\". The process of adapting Indian cooking continued for centuries. Anglo-Indian recipes could completely ignore Indian rules of diet, such as by using pork or beef. Some dishes, such as \\"liver curry, with bacon\\" were simply ordinary recipes spiced up with ingredients such as curry powder. In other cases like kedgeree, Indian dishes were adapted to British tastes; khichari was originally a simple dish of lentils and rice. Curry was accepted in almost all Victorian era cookery books, such as Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families (1845): she offered recipes for curried sweetbreads and curried macaroni, merging Indian and European foods into standard English cooking. By 1895, curry was included in Dainty Dishes for Slender Incomes, aimed at the poorer classes. Foreign influence was by no means limited to specific dishes. James Walvin, in his book Fruits of Empire, argues that potatoes, sugar (entirely imported until around 1900 and the growing of sugar beet), tea, and coffee as well as increasing quantities of spices were \\"Fruits of Empire\\" that became established in Britain between 1660 and 1800, so that by the nineteenth century \\"their exotic origins had been lost in the mists of time\\" and had become \\"part of the unquestioned fabric of local life\\". =Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine= Kedgeree, 1790, became a popular breakfast dish in the 19th century. During the British Raj, Britain first started borrowing Indian dishes, creating Anglo-Indian cuisine, with dishes such as Kedgeree (1790) and Mulligatawny soup (1791). Indian food was served in coffee houses from 1809, and cooked at home from a similar date as cookbooks of the time attest. The Veeraswamy restaurant in Regent Street, London, was opened in 1926, at first serving Anglo-Indian food, and is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in Britain. There was a sharp increase in the number of curry houses in the 1940s, and again in the 1970s.BBC: How Britain got the hots for curry Chicken tikka masala, 1971, adapted from Indian chicken tikka and called \\"a true British national dish.\\" The post-colonial Anglo-Indian dish chicken tikka masala was apparently invented in Glasgow in the early 1970s, while balti cuisine was introduced to Britain in 1977 in Birmingham. In 2003, there were roughly 9000 restaurants serving Indian cuisine in Britain. The majority of Indian restaurants in Britain are run by entrepreneurs of Bangladeshi (often Sylhet) and Pakistani origin. According to Britain's Food Standards Agency, the Indian food industry in the United Kingdom was worth ¬£3.2 billion in 2003, accounting for two-thirds of all eating out, and serving about 2.5 million British customers every week. Indian restaurants typically allow the diner to combine base ingredients ‚Äî chicken, prawns or \\"meat\\" (lamb or mutton) ‚Äî with curry sauces ‚Äî from the mild korma to the scorching phall ‚Äî without regard to the authenticity of the combination. The reference point for flavour and spice heat is the Madras curry sauce (the name represents the area of India where restaurateurs obtained their spices, rather than an actual dish). Other sauces are sometimes variations on a basic curry sauce:\\"Every restaurant has a large pan of this sauce always at hand, with the recipe varying only slightly from Chef to Chef. It forms the base of all Restaurant curries from the very mild to the very hot and spicy.\\" Khris Dillon The Curry Secret for instance, vindaloo is often rendered as a fiery dish of lamb or chicken in a Madras sauce with extra chilli, rather than the Anglo-Indian dish of pork marinated in wine vinegar and garlic, based on a Goan Portuguese dish carne de vinha d'alhos. Indian restaurants and their cuisine in Britain gradually improved from the stereotypical flock wallpaper and standardised menus. One of the pioneers was the Bombay Brasserie, which opened in Gloucester Road, London, in 1982, serving the kind of food actually eaten in India. It was followed in 1990 by Chutney Mary in Chelsea. In 2001, two Indian restaurants in London, Tamarind (opened 1995) and Zaika (opened 1999) gained Michelin stars for the quality of their cooking. Indian cuisine is the most popular alternative to traditional cooking in Britain, followed by Chinese and Italian food. By 2015, chicken tikka masala was one of Britain's most popular dishes. =Other influences= An English Chinatown, here in Birmingham Oriental cuisines have become widely available across England. Chinese cuisine became established in England by the 1970s, with large cities often having a Chinatown district; the first, in London's Soho, developed between the two world wars. Deriving from Cantonese cuisine, the food served by Chinese restaurants has been adapted to suit English taste. From around 1980 onwards, Southeast Asian cuisines, especially Thai and Vietnamese, began to gain popularity in England. Italian cuisine is the most popular Mediterranean cuisine in England. In its current form, with plenty of pizza and pasta, inspired by Elizabeth David, its rise began after 1945. There were some Italian restaurants before World War II, but they mostly served a generalised haute cuisine. Soon after the war, Italian coffee bars appeared, the first places to trade on their Italianness; they soon started to sell simple and cheap Italian food such as minestrone soup, spaghetti bolognese and pizza. From the early 1960s, the slightly more elegant trattoria restaurants offered \\"Italian specialities\\" such as lasagne verde al forno (baked lasagne, coloured with spinach). Other Mediterranean influences include Greek moussaka, feta and taramasalata, Turkish doner and shish kebabs, and Middle Eastern hummus. French cuisine is largely restricted to expensive restaurants, although there are some inexpensive French bistros. For many years, English writers including Hannah Glasse in the 18th century and Andrew Kirwan in the 19th century were ambivalent about French cooking.Hannah Glasse:British Library Andrew Valentine Kirwan: Host and Guest, A book about dinners, dinner- giving, wines and desserts, 1864 However, restaurants serving French haute cuisine developed for the upper and middle classes in England from the 1830sHaute Cuisine: How the French Invented the Culinary Profession (Chapter 3), Amy B. Trubek, 2000 and Escoffier was recruited by the Savoy Hotel in 1890. Marcel Boulestin's 1923 Simple French Cooking for English Homes did much to popularise French dishes. Food establishments = Cafes and tea shops = Cream tea, comprising tea taken with scones, clotted cream and jam, in Boscastle The English cafe is a small, inexpensive eating place. A working men's cafe serves mainly fried or grilled food, such as fried eggs, bacon, bangers and mash‚Äö black pudding, bubble and squeak, burgers, sausages, mushrooms and chips. These may be accompanied by baked beans, cooked tomatoes, and fried bread. These are referred to as \\"breakfast\\" even if they are available all day. Traditional cafes have declined with the rise of fast-food chains, but remain numerous all over the UK. A tea shop is a small restaurant that serves soft drinks and light meals, often in a sedate atmosphere. Customers may eat a cream tea in Cornish or Devonshire style, served from a china set, and a scone with jam and clotted cream. = Fish and chip shops = Fish and chips is a hot dish consisting of battered fish, commonly Atlantic cod or haddock, and chips. It is a common take-away food. Western Sephardic Jews settling in England from the 16th century would have prepared fried fish like pescado frito, coated in flour and fried in oil. Chips appeared in the Victorian era; Dickens's 1859 A Tale of Two Cities mentions \\"husky chips of potatoes, fried with some reluctant drops of oil\\". Fish and chip shops in the 1920s were often run by Jews or Italians. Despite this, the new dish was popularly attributed to France; The Times recorded that \\"potatoes chipped and fried in the French manner were introduced in Lancashire with great success about 1871.\\" The Fish Trades Gazette of 29 July 1922 stated that \\"Later there was introduced into this country the frying and purveying of chip potatoes from France ... which had made the fried fish trade what it is today.\\" =Pub food= Pub grub ‚Äì a pie, along with a pint The public house, or pub, is a famous English institution. In the mid-20th century, pubs were drinking establishments with little emphasis on the serving of food, other than \\"bar snacks\\", such as pork scratchings, pickled eggs, salted crisps, and peanuts, which helped to increase beer sales. If a pub served meals these were usually basic cold dishes such as a ploughman's lunch, invented in the 1950s. In the 1950s some British pubs started to offer \\"a pie and a pint\\", with hot individual steak and ale pies made easily on the premises by the landlord or his wife. In the 1960s this was developed into the then-fashionable \\"chicken in a basket\\", a portion of roast chicken with chips, served on a napkin, in a wicker basket, by the Mill pub at Withington. Quality dropped but variety increased with the introduction of microwave ovens and freezer food. \\"Pub grub\\" expanded to include British food items such as steak and kidney pudding, shepherd's pie, fish and chips, bangers and mash, Sunday roast, and pasties. The gastropub movement of the 21st century, on the other hand, seeks to serve restaurant-quality food, cooked to order from fresh ingredients, in a pub setting. In 1964, pubs were serving 9.1% of meals eaten outside the home; this rose rapidly to 37.5% by 1997.MINTEL survey, cited by Panayi 2010, pages 152, 176.  Vegetarianism  Modern Western vegetarianism was founded in the United Kingdom in 1847 with the world's first Vegetarian Society. It has increased markedly since the end of World War II, when there were around 100,000 vegetarians in the country. By 2003 there were between 3 and 4 million vegetarians in the UK, one of the highest percentages in the Western world, while around 7 million people claim to eat no red meat. By 2015, 11 of 22 restaurant chains studied by the Vegan Society had at least one vegan main course on their menu, though only 6 of these explicitly labelled them as vegan dishes. Top-end vegetarian restaurants remain relatively few, though they are increasing rapidly: there were some 20 in Britain in 2007, rising to 30 in 2010.  Quality  William Hogarth's O the Roast Beef of Old England (The Gate of Calais), 1748 English cuisine in the twentieth century suffered from a poor international reputation. Keith Arscott of Chawton House Library comments that \\"at one time people didn't think the English knew how to cook and yet these [eighteenth and nineteenth century] female writers were at the forefront of modern day cooking.\\" English food was popularly supposed to be bland, but English cuisine has made extensive use of spices since the Middle Ages; introduced curry to Europe; and makes use of strong flavourings such as English mustard. It was similarly reputed to be dull, like roast beef: but that dish was highly prized both in Britain and abroad, and few people could afford it; the \\"Roast Beef of Old England\\" lauded by William Hogarth in his 1748 painting celebrated the high quality of English cattle, which the French at the \\"Gate of Calais\\" (the other name of his painting) could only look at with envy. The years of wartime shortages and rationing certainly did impair the variety and flavour of English food during the twentieth century, but the nation's cooking recovered from this with increasing prosperity and the availability of new ingredients from soon after the Second World War. Scrambled Egg and Bacon Ice Cream, as served at The Fat Duck restaurant In 2005, 600 food critics writing for the British Restaurant magazine named 14 British restaurants among the 50 best restaurants in the world, the number one being The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, led by its chef Heston Blumenthal. The global reach of London has elevated it to the status of a leading centre of international cuisine. Meanwhile, the list of United Kingdom food and drink products with protected status (PDO) under European Union law has increased rapidly, with 59 items including Cornish sardines, Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese and Yorkshire forced rhubarb, Fenland celery, West Country lamb and beef and traditional Cumberland sausage listed as registered in 2015, and a further 13 including Birmingham Balti listed as applied for. By 2016 there were 12 cheeses from England with PDO status.

Mythology and Literature  left = Marriage = In Sophocles' account of Deianira's marriage, she was courted by the river god Achelous but saved from having to marry him by Heracles, who defeated Achelous in a wrestling contest for her hand in marriage. In another version of the tale where she was described as the daughter of Dexamenus, Heracles raped her and promised to come back and marry her. While he was away, the centaur Eurytion appeared and demanded her as his wife.

A wild centaur named Nessus attempted to kidnap or rape Deianira as he was ferrying her across the river Euenos, but she was rescued by Heracles, who shot the centaur with a poisoned arrow. As he lay dying, Nessus persuaded Deianira to take a sample of his blood, telling her that a potion of it mixed with olive oil would ensure that Heracles would never again be unfaithful. Deianira believed his words and kept a little of the potion by her. Heracles fathered illegitimate children all across Greece and then fell in love with Iole. When Deianira thus feared that her husband would leave her forever, she smeared some of the blood on Heracles' famous lionskin shirt. Heracles' servant, Lichas, brought him the shirt and he put it on. The centaur's toxic blood burned Heracles terribly, and eventually, he threw himself into a funeral pyre. In despair, Deianira committed suicide by hanging herself or with a sword. = Middle Age tradition = She is remembered in De Mulieribus Claris, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162.

Floor mosaic, Zeugma, Turkey. In Greek mythology, Achelous (also Acheloos or Acheloios) (; Ancient Greek: ·ºàœáŒµŒªœéœäŒøœÇ, and later , Akhel√¥ios) was the god associated with the Achelous River, the largest river in Greece. According to Hesiod, he was the son of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys. He was also said to be the father of the Sirens, several nymphs, and other offspring. Achelous was able to change his shape, and in the form of a bull, he wrestled Heracles for the right to marry Deianeira, but lost. He was also involved in the legend of the Archive hero Alcmaeon. Etymology The name ·ºàœáŒµŒªœéœäŒøœÇ is possibly pre-Greek, its meaning is not entirely certain. Recent arguments suggest it is Semitic in origin, with the initial Œëœá- stemming from the Akkadian a·∏´u (\\"bank of the river\\"), or a·∏´√ª (\\"seashore\\") and the suffix -ŒµŒªœé·º¥ŒøœÇ, from the Akkadian illu (\\"watercourse\\" or \\"water of the river invading land\\").Molinari and Sisci, pp. 93-95. Genealogy Hall of the Augustales. According to Hesiod, Achelous, along with all the other river gods, was the son of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys.Hesiod, Theogony 337-345, 366-370; so also Hyginus, Fabulae Theogony.6. According to the sixth-century mythographer Acusilaus, Achelous was the \\"oldest and most honoured\\" of the river-god offspring of Oceanus.Fowler 2103, pp. 12-13; Gantz, p. 28; Andolfi, fr. 1; Jebb, note on line 9; Freeman, p. 16; Acusilaus fr. 1 Fowler [= FGrHist 2 1 = Vorsokr. 9 B 21 = Macrobius, Saturnalia 5.18.9-10]. Compare with Hesiod Theogony 361, 777, and Aristotle, Metaphysics 1.983b where the river Styx is said to be the eldest (daughter) and most honored (Fowler 2013, p. 13). Servius relating a tradition of unknown origin, reports that Achelous was said to have been the son of Earth (i.e. Gaia).Fowler, p. 12; Fontenrose, p. 351; Servius on Virgil's Georgics 1.8. According to the Renaissance, mythographer Natalis Comes, Alcaeus had Achelous as the son of Ocean and Earth.Alcaeus fr. 450 Campbell. Achelous had various offspring.Parada, s.v. Achelous, p. 3. He was said to be the father of the Sirens.Grimal, s.v. Sirens p. 421; Ker√©nyi 1951, pp. 56, 58. According to the 3rd-century BC poet Lycophron, the Sirens were the daughters of Achelous, by an unnamed \\"melodious mother\\" (perhaps meaning the mother was a Muse).Lycophron, Alexandra 712-716, with Mair's notes. Another 3rd-century BC poet Apollonius of Rhodes, makes the mother the Muse Terpsichore,Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 4.893; Nonnus, Dionysiaca 13.313-315. while according to other accounts, she was the Muse Melpomene,Apollodorus, 1.3.4, E 7.18; Hyginus, Fabulae Theogony.30, 125.13. or the Calydonian princess Sterope.Apollodorus, 1.7.10. Ovid calls the Sirens simply daughters of Achelous, with no mention of their mother.Ovid, Metamorphoses 5.552-555, 14.87-88. By Perimede, the daughter of Aeolus, Achelous was said to have fathered Hippodamas and Orestes.Hard, p. 410; Apollodorus, 1.7.3; Hesiod, fr. 10.34‚Äì45 Most (pp. 54-55). Achelous was also said to be the father (with no mothers mentioned) of several nymphs associated with various springs.Grimal, s.v. Achelous, p. 4. These included Pirene, the nymph of a spring at Corinth,Pausanias, 2.2.3. Castalia, the nymph of a spring at Delphi,Panyassis fr. 2 West = Pausanias, 10.8.9. and Dirce, the nymph of a spring (and the stream that flowed from it) at Thebes, which became associated with the Dirce who was Antiope's aunt.Hard, p. 304; Euripides, Bacchae 519-520. Plato has \\"the nymphs\\" as daughters of Achelous,Plato, Phaedrus 263d. and the 5th-century BC poet Panyassis seems also to have referred to \\"Achelesian nymphs\\".D'Alessio, p. 30; Panyassis fr. 23 West. He was also the father (again with no mother metioned) of Alcmeon's second wife Callirrhoe, whose name means \\"the lovely spring\\".Hard, p. 327; Grimal, s.v. Achelous, p. 4; Apollodorus, 3.7.5; Pausanias, 8.24.9. Such examples suggest the possibility of a tradition in which Achelous was considered to be the father of all springs or, at least, the nymphs associated with them.See D'Alessio, p. 30, which attributes to Panyassis, and \\"other fifth-century authors the idea that all springs derive\\" from Achelous. Mythology =Heracles and Deianeira= Achelous was a suitor for Deianeira, daughter of Oeneus, the king of Calydon; he transformed himself into a bull and fought Heracles for the right to marry Deianeira, but was defeated, and Heracles married Deianeira.Gantz, pp. 28-29, 41-42, 431-433; Hard, pp. 41, 279-280; Fowler 2013, pp. 323-324; Fontenrose, pp. 350-356; Sophocles, Women of Trachis 9-26, 497-525; Ovid, Metamorphoses 9.1-100, Amores 3.6.35-36, Heroides 9.137-140, 16.263-268; Hyginus, Fabulae 31.7; Apollodorus, 1.8.1, 2.7.5; Propertius, Elegies 2.34.33-34; Pausanias, 3.18.16, 6.19.12; Statius, Thebaid 4.106; Philostratus the Younger, Imagines 4; Nonnus, Dionysiaca 17.238-239, 43.12-15. The story of Achelous battle with Heracles, as a bull, for Deianeira, was apparently told as early as the 7th century BC, in a lost poem by the Greek poet Archilochus, while according to a summary of a lost poem by the early 5th-century BC Greek poet Pindar, during the battle, Heracles broke off one of Achelous's bull-horns, and the river-god was able to get his horn back by trading it for a horn from Amalthea.Gantz, pp. 28, 41-42, 432; Hard, p. 280; Jebb, Introduction 5; Archilochus, fr. 286 West [= Dio Chrysostom, 60.1], fr. 287 West [= Scholiast on Homer, Iliad 21.237]. Compare with Apollodorus, 2.7.5 [= Pherecydes of Athens fr. 42 Fowler], which says that the horn of Amalthea which Acelous traded for his broken-off horn, was also a bull's horn which, \\"according to Pherecydes, had the power of supplying meat or drink in abundance, whatever one might wish\\". Amalthea was the owner of a goat (or in later sources the goat itself) that nursed the infant Zeus (see Gantz, p. 41). According to Hard, p. 280, Apollodorus making Amalthea's horn of plenty a bull's horn was \\"evidently a misapprehension\\" arising from the fact that it was traded for the bull-horn of Achelous. According to Fowler 2013, pp. 323- 324: \\"We are dealing here with different traditions, one a folktale about a magical cornucopia, the other a story about the goat that nursed the infant Zeus. By the time of Pherekydes these have become entangled with each other.\\" Sophocles, in his play Women of Trachis (c. 450-425 BC), has Deianeira tell her story, how Achelous wooed her in the shape of a bull, a snake, and a half- man/half-bull:Gantz, p. 432. :For my suitor was a river-god, Achelous, who in three shapes was always asking me from my father‚Äîcoming now as a bull in visible form, now as a serpent, sheeny and coiled, now ox-faced with human trunk, while from his thick-shaded beard wellheads of fountain-water sprayed. In the expectation that such a suitor would get me, I was always praying in my misery that I might die, before I should ever approach that marriage-bed. But at last, to my joy, the glorious son of Zeus and Alcmena came and closed with him in combat and delivered me.Sophocles, Women of Trachis 9-21; compare with the Chorus's description of the fight at 497-525. In later accounts, Achelous does not get his horn back, as he did in Pindar's poem. Ovid, in his poem Metamorphoses (8 AD), has Achelous tell the story.Gantz, p. 433; Ovid, Metamorphoses 9.1-100; compare with Ovid, Amores 3.6.35-36. In this version, Achelous fights Heracles, and loses three times: first in his normal (human?) shape, then as a snake, and finally as a bull. Heracles tore off one of Achelous's bull-horns, and the Naiads filled the horn with fruit and flowers, transforming it into the \\"Horn of Plenty\\" (cornucopia).Gantz, p. 42; Ovid, Metamorphoses 9.85-88. According to the Fabulae (before 207 AD), by the Latin mythographer Hyginus, Heracles gave the broken-off horn to \\"the Hesperides (or Nymphs)\\", and it was \\"these goddesses\\" who \\"filled the horn with fruit and called it \\"Cornucopia\\".Fontenrose, p. 351; Hyginus, Fabulae 31.7. According to Strabo, in some versions of the story Heracles gave Achelous's horn to Deianeira's father Oeneus as a wedding gift.Jebb, note on line 518; Strabo, 10.2.19. Cf. Nonnus, Dionysiaca 17.238-239. While several sources make Achelous the father, by various mothers, of the Sirens (see above), according to the 4th-century AD Greek teacher of rhetoric Libanius, they were born from the blood Achelous shed when Heracles broke off his horn.Grimal, s.v. Sirens p. 421; Ker√©nyi 1959, p. 199; Ker√©nyi 1951, p. 56; Libanius, Progymnasmata, Narration 1: \\"On Deianira\\" (Gibson, pp. 10-11), Narration 31: \\"On Deianira\\" (Gibson, pp. 32-33). Compare with the birth of the Erinyes (Furies), Giants, and the Meliae, born the from the blood shed when Uranus was castrated by his son, the Titan Cronus. Both Diodorus Siculus and Strabo provide rationalized accounts of the story.Fontenrose, p. 351; Frazer, note 2 to Apollodorus 2.7.5; Smith 1873, s.v. Achelous; Diodorus Siculus, 4.35.3-4; Strabo, 10.2.19. According to Diodorus, Heracles diverted the Achelous River's course, while according to Strabo, some writers \\"conjecturing the truth from the myths\\" said that, to please his father-in-law Oeneus, Heracles confined the river by means of \\"embankments and channels\\". In this way, Heracles defeated the raging river, and in so doing created a large amount of new fertile land and \\"certain poets, as we are told, have made this deed into a myth\\" (Diodorus). By both accounts, this new bountiful land of the Achelous River delta came to be known as Amaltheia's horn of plenty. Joseph Fontenrose saw in this story the possible reflection of an ancient tradition of conflict between Zeus and Achelous.Fontenrose, p. 233. =Other stories= Achelous played a role in the story of the Theban hero Alcmaeon, who had killed his mother Eriphyle because of her treachery against his father Amphiaraus, and needed to be religiously purified.Hard, p. 327; Grimal, s.v. Alcmaeon, p. 31. According to Apollodorus, Alcmaeon was first purified by Phegeus the king of Psophis, but nevertheless the land of Psophis became barren because of the cursed Alcmaeon's presence. As Thucydides tells the story, the oracle of Apollo told Alcmaeon that he needed to find a land to live in that did not yet exist at the time of his mother's death. After long travels, Alcmaeon finally came to the springs of the Achelous River, where he was purified by the river-god, and received Achelous's daughter Callirrhoe as his wife, and at the mouth of the river he discovered a land newly made by deposits of river silt, where he could make his home free of his curse.Apollodorus, 3.7.5; Thucydides, 2.102.2-6\\\\. Compare with Ovid, Fasti 2.43-46; Pausanias, 8.24.8-9. Later, according to Apollodorus, Achelous commanded Alcmaeon to dedicate the necklace and robe the cause of his mother's treachery at Delphi, which he did.Apollodorus, 3.7.7. The Banquet of Achelous, by Rubens, c. 1615 Ovid, in his Metamorphoses, has the river-god involved in two transformation stories concerning the creation of islands near the mouth of the Achelous River.Hard, p. 42; Tripp, s.v. Achelo√ºs, p. 5. According to Ovid, the Echinades Islands were once five local nymphs.Ovid, Metamorphoses 8.574-589. One day, the nymphs were offering sacrifices to the gods on the banks of the Achelous, but they forgot to include Achelous himself. The river-god became so angry, he overflowed his banks with a raging flood, sweeping the nymphs away into the sea. As Achelous tells the story: :\\"I tore forests from forests, fields from fields; and with the place they stood on, I swept the nymphs away, who at last remembered me then, into the sea. There my flood and the sea, united, cleft the undivided ground into as many parts as now you see the Echinades yonder amid the waves.\\"Ovid, Metamorphoses 8.583-589. Achelous goes on to describe the creation of another island: \\"far away beyond the others is one island that I love: the sailors call it Perimele.\\"Ovid, Metamorphoses 8.590-591. She was the daughter of Hippodamas, whose virginity Achelous took from her. Her enraged father threw her off a high cliff into the sea. But Achelous prayed to Poseidon to save her, and in answer Poseidon transformed the girl into an island.Ovid, Metamorphoses 8.592-610. Cult From at least as early as Homer, Achelous was apparently considered to be an important divinity throughout Greece.Fowler, p. 12; Jebb, note on line 9; Smith 1873, s.v. Achelous. Calling Achelous \\"king\\", Homer mentions Achelous (along with Oceanus) as a mighty river, using him as a measure of the strength of (the even mightier) Zeus:Gantz, p. 28. :With [Zeus] doth not even king Achelous vie, nor the great might of deep-flowing Ocean, from whom all rivers flow and every sea, and all the springs and deep wells; howbeit even he hath fear of the lightning of great Zeus, and his dread thunder, whenso it crasheth from heaven.Homer, Iliad 21.194-199; compare Pausanias, 8.38.10. The clear implication is that Achelous is the mightiest of the rivers (save perhaps for Oceanus himself), which would be in accord with Acusilaus' making Achelous the \\"oldest and most honoured\\" of the river-god offspring of Oceanus.Andolfi, fr.1. However some ancient scholars thought that the line: \\"nor the great might of deep-flowing Ocean\\", was spurious, which would in fact make Achelous rather than Oceanusthe source of all other waters.Fowler 2013, p. 12; Andolfi, fr. 1. For a detailed discussion of this issue, arguing that the version of the Iliad with line 21.195 omitted \\"represents the earlier textual stage\\", see D'Alessio, pp. 16-23\\\\. This would of course account for the possible tradition (mentioned above) of Achelous being the source of all springs. As noted by Andolfi, \\"the insertion of l. 195 was functional to restore consistency within Homeric mythology and to eliminate an unorthodox peculiarity that did not match the cosmogonic account in book fourteen of the Iliad, where Oceanus' predominance is unquestionable.\\" A commentary on Iliad 21.195, preserved on Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 221, contains a fragment of a poem, possibly from the Epic tradition, which mentions \\"the waters of silver-eddying Achelous\\" being the source of \\"the whole sea\\".West 2003, fr. 12, pp. 292, 293; D'Alessio, p. 18; P.Oxy. 221 ix 1; 5.93 Erbse. A late-5th-century BC commentary on Orphic theogony, preserved by the Derveni Papyrus, quotes a poetic fragment calling the rivers the \\"sinews of Achelous\\".West 1983, pp. 92,115. According to D'Alessio, pp. 20-23, this poetic fragment may be from the same poem (or near contemporary versions of the same poem) as the fragment quoted in Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 221. For a discussion of the translation of ·º∂ŒΩŒ±œÇ as \\"sinews\\" see D'Alessio, pp. 23ff. The same Oxyrhynchus Papyrus also quotes ancient verses which apparently equated Achelous and Oceanus,Fowler 2013, p. 12; Schironi, p. 319; D'Alessio, pp. 30-31 (which discusses the probable attribution of these quotes to the 5th-century BC poet Panyassis); Panyassis fr. 13 West; P.Oxy. 221 ix 8-11; 5.93-94 Erbse. Fontenrose, p. 232, reads the Iliad passage itself, as appearing to identify Achelous and Oceanus. and that \\"many people sacrifice to Achelois before sacrificing to Demeter, since Acheloios is the name of all rivers and the crop comes from water\\".D'Alessio, pp. 18, 31; P.Oxy. 221 ix 18-20. According to the early 4th-century BC Greek historian Ephorus, the oracle at Dodona usually added to his pronouncements the command to offer sacrifices to Achelous, and that, while people would offer sacrifices to their local river, only the Achelous river was honoured everywhere, with Achelous's name often being invoked in oaths, prayers and sacrifices, \\"all the things that concern the gods.\\"Fowler 2013, p. 12, D'Alessio, p. 32; Andolfi, fr.1; Ephorus FGrHist 70 20a = Macrobius, Saturnalia 5.18.6-8. His name was often used to mean \\"water\\".Fowler 2013, p. 12; Molinari and Sisci, p. 60; D'Alessio, pp. 20, 32; Andolfi, fr. 1; West 1983, p. 92 n. 39; Macrobius, Saturnalia 5.18.1-12; Servius, On Virgil's Georgics 1.8 (which ascribes the usage to Orpheus, see Orphic fr. 344 Kern); Ephorus, FGrHist 70 20a = Macrobius, Saturnalia 5.18.6-8\\\\. See for example: Sophocles fr. 5 Lloyd-Jones; Euripides, Bacchae 625, Hypsipyle, fr. 753 [= Macrobius, Saturnalia 5.18.12]; Aristophanes fr. 365 Henderson = fr. 365 PCG = Macrobius, Saturnalia 5.18.5. For a discussion of Achelous as a water-deity see Molinari and Sisci, pp. 60-62. Thus Euripides can have a house, far from the Achelous river, being sprinkled with \\"Achelous' water\\".Euripides, Andromache 165-168. Ephorus explained this \\"puzzle\\" by saying that, because of the frequent oracular command at Dodona to offer sacrifices to Achelous, it came to be thought that by \\"Achelous\\" the oracle meant, not the river but \\"water\\" in general.D'Alessio, p. 18; Andolfi, fr. 1; Ephorus, FGrHist 70 20a = Macrobius, Saturnalia 5.18.6-8. Plato has Socrates, walking in the countryside, come across a \\"sacred place of some nymphs and of Achelous, judging by the figurines and statues\\".Plato, Phaedrus 230b. The 2nd-century geographer Pausanias, mentions a part of the altar at the Amphiareion of Oropos dedicated to \\"the nymphs and to Pan, and to the rivers Achelous and Cephisus\\",Pausanias, 1.34.3. as well as an altar to Achelous near Megara,Pausanias, 1.41.2. and the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, which contained a dedication representing the fight of Heracles with Achelous.Pausanias, 6.19.12. Iconography Heracles wrestling with Achelous. Illustration from a Stamnos attributed to Oltos, c. 525-475 BC, London, British Museum E437.LIMC 9321 Acheloos 245; Beazley Archive 200437. Achelous' wrestling bout with Heracles was the subject of several vase-paintings, from as early as the second quarter of the sixth century BC, and in most of these vases, Heracles can be seen grabbing Achelous by his single horn.Gantz, p. 433. Possibly the earliest version of the scene (c. 600-560 BC) appears on the figure frieze of a Middle Corinthian kylix cup (Brussels A1374), which depicts Heracles wrestling with a horned centaur-like Achelous, with a human torso and a bull's or horse's body, watched by the figure of an old man (Oineus?) and a woman (Deiaeira?).Gantz, p. 433; Stafford, pp. 75‚Äì76; Boardman, p. 2; Luce, pp. 430-431; LIMC 4267 Acheloos 246; Beazley Archive 1011067. The cited sources give various date ranges, Stafford: c. 590-580 BC, Boardman: c. 570-560 BC, LIMC: 600-575 BC. The earliest Attic versions (c. 570 BC) depict Achelous as a bull with a man's face and beard.Gantz, p. 433; New York 50.64 (LIMC 4268 Acheloos 214; Beazley Archive 350203; Metropolitan Museum of Art 59.64); Boston 99.519 (Luce, pp. 425-437; LIMC 15049 Acheloos 215; Beazley Archive 300620). Heracles fighting Achelous, with his broken-off horn lying on the ground. An Attic column krater, Louvre G365 (c. 475-425).LIMC 4275 Acheloos 218; Beazley Archive 6911. On one later example (c. 525-475 BC), an Attic red-figure stamnos from Cerveteri attributed to Oltos (London E437), Achelous (identified by inscription) is shown with a bearded human upper torso, attached to a long serpentine body, with a fish's tail. This is similar to the depictions of the sea-god Triton which appear on many other Attic vases. Heracles (also identified by inscription) appears about to break off the river-god's single horn.Schefold, p. 159; Stafford, p. 76; Fontenrose, pp. 233-234; LIMC 9321 Acheloos 245; Beazley Archive 200437; AVI 4590. On a somewhat later (c. 475-425 BC) red-figure Attic column krater (Louvre G365), Achelous's broken-off horn lies on the ground, while Heracles holds Achelous by his other horn, and threatens him with a club held overhead.Gantz, p. 433; LIMC 4275 Acheloos 218; Beazley Archive 6911. As Gantz notes, the depiction of a broken-off horn lying on the ground, may also have been depicted already on an Archaic scarab (London 489). Figures depicting Oineus and Deiaeira (as presumably on the Corinthian cup) and also Athena and Hermes are sometimes included in the scene.Gantz, p. 433. Pausanias reports seeing the scene represented on the throne of Amyclae,Gantz, p. 433; Stafford, p. 75; Pausanias, 3.18.16. and also in the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, where he describes seeing \\"small cedar-wood figures inlaid with gold\\" which, besides Achelous, included Zeus, Deianeira, Heracles, and Ares aiding Achelous.Gantz, p. 433; Stafford, pp. 75-76; Pausanias, 6.19.12. The river-god is depicted on several Acarnanian coins as a bull with the head of an old man.Smith 1873, s.v. Achelous. The most common depiction of Achelous in Archaic and Classical times was this man-faced bull.Molinari and Sisci, pp. 91-96. Often a city would feature a man-faced bull on its coinage to represent a local variant of Achelous, such as Achelous Gelas of Gela, Sicily, or Achelous Sebethos of Neapolis, Campania.Molinari and Sisci, pp. 97ff. Possible origins That Achelous, rather than Oceanus, was perhaps, in some earlier version of the Iliad, the source of \\"all rivers ... and every sea\\", and that his name was often used to mean \\"water\\", have (along with other evidence from ancient sources), suggested the possibility to modern scholars that Achelous may have predated Oceanus as the original Greek water-god.Fowler 2013, p. 12. Bronze coin struck in Oiniadai, c. 215 BC, depicting the river-god Achelous as man- faced bull on reverse. A recent study has tried to show that both the form and substance of Achelous, as a god of water primarily depicted as a man-faced bull, have roots in Old Europe in the Bronze Age. After the disappearance of many Old European cultures, the traditions traveled to the Near East at the beginning of 4th millennium BC (Ubaid period),Molinari and Sisci, pp. 1-6. and finally migrated to Greece, Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia with itinerant sea- folk during the Late Bronze Age through the Orientalizing period.Molinari and Sisci, pp. 22-30. Although no single cult of Achelous persisted throughout all of these generations, the iconography and general mythos easily spread from one culture to another, and all examples of man-faced bulls are found around the area of the Mediterraneanan, suggesting some intercultural continuity.Molinari and Sisci, pp. 97ff. Achelous was also an important deity in the Etruscan religion, intimately related to water as in the Greek tradition but also carrying significant chthonic associations. Man-faced bull iconography was first adapted to represent Achelous by the Etruscans in the 8th century BC, and the Greeks later adopted this same tradition.Molinari and Sisci, pp. 48-68. The leading exponents into the Greek and Etruscan worlds were seer-healers and mercenaries during the Iron Age, and Achelous as a man- faced bull becomes an emblem employed by mercenaries in the Greek world for centuries.Molinari and Sisci, pp. 22-30. These earlier figures probably adapted the mythological and iconographic traditions of Asall√∫hi (also Asarl√∫hi or Asaruludu),Molinari and Sisci, p. 14. the \\"princely bison\\" of Near Eastern traditions that \\"rises to the surface of the earth in springs and marshes, ultimately flowing as rivers.\\" The Achelous River The Achelous River rises in the Pindus mountains, flows into the Ionian Sea near the Echinades Islands in western Greece, and divided ancient Acarnania and Aetolia. Servius gives a story of the origin of the river. He says that one day Achelous, who was said to be the son of Earth, lost his daughters the Sirens, and in his grief he called upon his mother, who received him into her bosom, and on that spot, Earth caused a river, bearing his name, to gush forth.Smith 1873, s.v. Achelous; Servius, ad Virg. Georg. i. 9. Pseudo- Plutarch gives a different story for how the river acquired its name. He says it was formerly called Thestius, after a son of Mars and Pisidice, who jumped into the river after discovering he had killed his son Calydon by mistake. In a similar fashion the river acquired the name Achelous, after a son of Oceanus and the nymph Nais, who jumped into the river after he discovered he had slept with his daughter Cletoria by mistake.Fontenrose, p. 352; Smith 1873, s.v. Achelous; Pseudo-Plutarch, De fluviis 22. Strabo reports that in \\"earlier times\\" the river was called the Thoas.Fontenrose, p. 352; Strabo, 10.2.1. According to Strabo, some writers \\"conjecturing the truth from the myths\\" attributed various legends concerning the river-god, to features of the Achelous River itself. These writers said that, like other rivers, the Achelous was called \\"like a bull\\", because of the river's roaring waters and its meanders (which he says were called horns). Likewise the Achelous was called \\"like a serpent\\" because of the river's great length and many serpentine turnings.Smith 1873, s.v. Achelous; Strabo, 10.2.19. Compare with Diodorus Siculus, 4.35.3-4. Homer locates another Achelous river in Lydia, near Mount Sipylos,Homer, Iliad 24.614-617; cf. Pausanias, 8.38.10 and there were several other rivers with the name Achelous in ancient times.Molinari and Sisci, p. 61, says there were at least six such rivers. Strabo mentions two: one in Thessaly near Lamia (9.5.10, 10.2.1; Smith 1854 s.v. Achelous 2.), the other in Achaia near Dyme, also called the Peiros (8.3.11, 10.2.1; Smith 1854 s.v. Achelous 4.). Pausanias, 8.38.9-10, mentions one more: a tributary of the Alpheius in the Peloponnese, near Mount Lycaeus in Arcadia (Smith 1854 s.v. Achelous 3.). The multiplicity of rivers with the same name, perhaps due to the river-god's equation with water,Andolfi, fr.1. has also been seen as suggesting the possibility that Achelous was originally \\"the primal source of all water\\".Molinari and Sisci, p. 61. In the Metamorphoses Ovid in his Metamorphoses provided a descriptive interlude when Theseus is the guest of Achelous, waiting for the river's raging flood to subside: \\"He entered the dark building, made of spongy pumice, and rough tuff. The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells.\\"Ovid, Metamorphoses VIII, 547ff.

It is long, and its drainage area is .Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment , Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change, p. 54 Its source is near the village Zotiko, in the southwestern part of the Ioannina regional unit and it flows into the Ionian Sea in Ammoudia, near Parga. Mythology In ancient Greek mythology, Acheron was known as the \\"river of woe\\", and was one of the five rivers of the Greek underworld. The word is of uncertain etymology.R. S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 182. In the Homeric poems, the Acheron was described as a river of Hades, into which Cocytus and Phlegethon both flowed.Homer, The Odyssey x. 513Pausanias, Description of Greece i. 17, ¬ß 5 The Roman poet Virgil called it the principal river of Tartarus, from which the Styx and Cocytus both sprang.Virgil, Aeneid vi. 297 The newly dead would be ferried across the Acheron by Charon in order to enter the Underworld.Virgil, Aeneid 6. 323 William Blake's depiction of \\"The Vestibule of Hell and the Souls Mustering to Cross the Acheron\\" in his Illustrations to Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\" object 5 c. 1824‚Äì27. The original for the work is held by the National Gallery of Victoria. The Suda describes the river as \\"a place of healing, not a place of punishment, cleansing and purging the sins of humans\\".Suda On Line According to later traditions, Acheron had been a son of Helios and either Gaia or Demeter, who had been turned into the Underworld river bearing his name after he refreshed the Titans with drink during their contest with Zeus.Natalis Comes. Mythologiae, 3.1 By this myth, Acheron is also the father of Ascalaphus by either OrphneOvid, Metamorphoses 5. 539 or Gorgyra.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1. 33 The river called Acheron with the nearby ruins of the Necromanteion is found near Parga on the mainland opposite Corfu. Another branch of Acheron was believed to surface at the Acherusian cape (now Karadeniz Ereƒüli in Turkey) and was seen by the Argonauts according to Apollonius of Rhodes. Greeks who settled in Italy identified the Acherusian lake into which Acheron flowed with Lake Avernus. Plato in his Phaedo identified Acheron as the second greatest river in the world, excelled only by Oceanus. Following Greek mythology, Charon ferries souls across the Acheron to Hell. Those who were neutral in life sit on the banks He claimed that Acheron flowed in the opposite direction from Oceanus beneath the earth under desert places. The word is also occasionally used as a synecdoche for Hades itself. Virgil mentions Acheron with the other infernal rivers in his description of the underworld in Book VI of the Aeneid. In Book VII, line 312Line 312 in the conventional lineation, see J.W. Mackail (Editor and Translator), The AEneid (Clarendon press, Oxford: 1930), p. 271. he gives to Juno the famous saying, flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo: 'If I cannot bend the will of Heaven, I shall move Hell.' The same words were used by Sigmund Freud as the dedicatory motto for his seminal book The Interpretation of Dreams, figuring Acheron as psychological underworld beneath the conscious mind. The Acheron was sometimes referred to as a lake or swamp in Greek literature, as in Aristophanes' The Frogs and Euripides' Alcestis. In Dante's Inferno, the Acheron river forms the border of Hell. Following Greek mythology, Charon ferries souls across this river to Hell. Those who were neutral in life sit on the banks.  Modern references in popular culture  The name Acheron was used as a reference within the Alien film series for the planet LV426 (where the crashed alien vessel containing the face-huggers was originally found). Known solely by its alphanumeric designation during the first film, the planet was named as Acheron during the sequel Aliens. Robert E. Howard used Acheron as the name of an ancient kingdom, ruled by evil sorcerers a few thousand years before The Hyborian Age. In The Hour of the Dragon, the only novel-length Conan the Barbarian story by Howard, the wizard Xaltotun, formerly of Acheron, is resurrected by necromancy and is Conan's main antagonist. Acheron was the French privateer ship that Captain Jack Aubrey pursued in the film of the book; Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003). The first movement of the first track on the album Warp Riders by The Sword is titled \\"Acheron\\". The name \\"Acheron\\" is also used the Lawful (Neutral) Evil Outer Plane in Dungeons & Dragons, however it is described as consisting of a huge number of iron cubes of varying size, instead of a river. Acheron was referenced in Golden Sun: The Lost Age as a critical hit named 'Acheron's Grief' by one of Golden Sun's endgame weapons: 'Darksword'. In addition, the River Acheron makes multiple appearances in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. \\"Acheron\\" is a track name off the debut album Pantheon of the Nightside Gods by the band Belzebubs. Acheron is the name of an alliance lord from the video game Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Honours Acheron Lake in Antarctica is named after the mythical river.

Early life and education Johns Frederick Rulifson was born August 20, 1941 in Bellefontaine, Ohio. His father was Erwin Charles Rulifson and mother was Virginia Helen Johns. Rulifson married Janet Irving on June 8, 1963 and had two children. He received a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Washington in 1966. Rulifson earned a Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 1973. Career Rulifson joined the Augmentation Research Center, at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) in 1966, working on a form of software called ‚Äútimesharing‚Äù. He led the software team that implemented the oN-Line System (NLS), a system that foreshadowed many future developments in modern computing and networking. Specifically, Rulifson developed the command language for the NLS, among other features. His first job was to create the first display-based on the CDC 3100, and the programs he wrote included the first online editor. He also redesigned its file structure. Rulifson was also lead programmerhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7768481.stm and wrote the program and demonstration files for the first public demonstration of the computer mouse in 1968. He was also the chief programmer of the first use of hypertext. Although Douglas Engelbart was the founder and leader of ARC, Rulifson's innovative programming was essential to the realization of Engelbart's vision. Rulifson was also involved in the development of NIL. Rulifson was the SRI's representative to the \\"network working group\\" in 1968, which led to the first connection on the ARPANET. He described the Decode- Encode Language (DEL), which was designed to allow remote use of NLS over ARPANET. Although never used, the idea was small \\"programs\\" would be down- loaded to enhance user interaction. This concept was fully developed in Sun Microsystems's Java programming language almost 30 years later, as applets. Simultaneously, he was involved in the development of the AI programming language QA4. This system was used for the planning done by Shakey, one of the first robots. He left SRI to join the System Sciences Laboratory (SSL) within Xerox PARC in 1973. Here he began work on personal computing and the creation of local networks. One of his first actions was to develop the concept for the desktop icon. By 1978 he was the manager of the center's Office Research Group, where he introduced the use of interdisciplinary scholars into the group's work. Specifically, he was the first computer scientist to begin working alongside anthropologists, hiring several at Xerox to improve their use of field research and enter the field of social science research. At PARC, he worked on implementing distributed office systems. In 1980, he worked for ROLM as an engineering manager and joined Syntelligence, an artificial intelligence applications vendor in Sunnyvale, California, in 1985. He began working for Sun Microsystems Laboratories in 1987, and held positions including as a director of engineering, technology development, and research groups. He then managed Ivan Sutherland's lab from 2003 until his retirement.https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/sri-010709.html He is an emeritus board member of the Doug Engelbart Institute and Chairman of The Open Group. Jeff Rulifsons papers and research from 1956 to 1997 are held at the Computer History Museum, with a guide to his work entitled Guide to the Jeff Rulifson papers, written by Bo Doub, Kim Hayden, and Sara Chabino Lott. Awards In 1990, Rulifson won the Association for Computing Machinery's Software System Award for implementing groundbreaking innovations such as hypertext, outline processors, and video conferencing. In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, for his ‚Äúpioneering work on augmenting human intellect with hypertext, outline processors, and video conferencing.‚Äù In 2006 Rulifson was named to the SRI International Hall of Fame.

Both the screenplay and the successful stage play on which it was based were written by English playwright Frederick Knott. The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346863/ before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October. Originally intended to be shown in dual-strip polarized 3-D, the film played in most theatres in ordinary 2-D due to the loss of interest in the 3-D process (the projection of which was difficult and error-prone) by the time of its release. The film earned an estimated $2.7 million in North American box office sales in 1954. Plot Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an English professional tennis player, is married to wealthy socialite Margot (Grace Kelly), who has had an affair with American crime-fiction writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). When Tony retires from tennis, he secretly discovers the affair and decides to murder his unfaithful wife, both for revenge and to ensure that her money will continue to fund his comfortable lifestyle. Tony invites an old acquaintance from the University of Cambridge, Charles Alexander Swann (Anthony Dawson), to his London flat. Tony is aware that Swann has become a small-time criminal with several aliases, and has been secretly following Swann so he can blackmail him into murdering Margot. Tony tells Swann about Margot's affair. Six months ago, Tony had stolen her handbag, which contained a love letter from Mark, and anonymously blackmailed her. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony offers to pay him ¬£1,000 to kill Margot; if Swann refuses, Tony will turn him in to the police as Margot's blackmailer. Swann's credibility, in denying Tony's accusation, would be hurt by his criminal record. After Swann agrees, Tony explains his plan: the following evening he will go with Mark to a party, leaving Margot at home while hiding her latchkey under the carpet of the staircase facing the front door of their flat. Swann is to sneak in when Margot is fast asleep and hide behind the curtains in front of the French doors to the garden. At eleven o'clock, Tony will telephone the flat from the party. Swann must strangle Margot when she answers the phone, open the French doors, leave signs that would trick the police into believing that a burglary had gone wrong, and then exit through the front door before hiding the key under the stair carpet again. The following night, Swann enters the flat while Margot is in bed, and waits. At the party, Tony discovers that his watch has stopped, so he phones the flat three minutes later than intended. When Margot comes to the phone, Swann tries to strangle her with his scarf, but she manages to grab a pair of scissors and stab him fatally in the back. She picks up the telephone receiver and pleads for help. Tony tells her not to touch anything until he arrives home. When he returns to the flat, he calls the police and sends Margot to bed. Before the police arrive, Tony moves what he thinks is Margot's latchkey from Swann's pocket into her handbag, plants Mark's letter on Swann, and destroys Swann's scarf, replacing it with Margot's own stocking in an attempt to incriminate her. The following day, Tony persuades Margot to hide the fact that he told her not to call the police immediately. Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) arrives and questions the Wendices, and Margot makes several conflicting statements. When Hubbard says Swann must have entered through the front door, Tony falsely claims to have seen Swann at the time Margot's handbag was stolen, and suggests that Swann made a copy of her key. Hubbard does not believe this because no key was found on Swann's body upon inspection. Hubbard arrests Margot after concluding that she killed Swann for blackmailing her. Margot is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Some months later, on the day before Margot's scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony, saying he has devised a story for Tony to tell the police in order to save Margot from execution. To Tony's consternation, Mark's \\"story\\" is very close to what did actually happen: that Tony bribed Swann to murder Margot. Tony says the story is too unrealistic. Hubbard arrives unexpectedly, and Mark hides in the bedroom. Hubbard questions Tony about large sums of cash he has been spending, tricks him into revealing that his latchkey is in his raincoat, and inquires about Tony's attach√© case. Tony claims to have lost the case, but Mark, overhearing the conversation, finds it on the bed, full of banknotes. Deducing that the money was Tony's intended payoff to Swann, Mark stops Hubbard from leaving and explains his theory. Tony tells another lie, \\"confessing\\" that the cash was Margot's blackmail payment to Swann, which he had concealed to cover up her guilt. Hubbard appears to accept Tony's explanation over Mark's theory, and Mark leaves angrily. Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tony's. As soon as Tony leaves, Hubbard uses Tony's key to re-enter the flat, followed by Mark. Hubbard had already discovered that the key in Margot's handbag was Swann's own latchkey, and deduced that Swann had put the Wendices' key back in its hiding-place after unlocking the door. Now, correctly suspecting Tony of having conspired with Swann, Hubbard had developed an elaborate ruse to confirm this. Plainclothes policemen bring Margot from prison to the flat. She tries unsuccessfully to unlock the door with the key in her handbag, then enters through the garden, thus proving to Hubbard that she is unaware of the hidden key and is therefore innocent. Hubbard has Margot's handbag returned to the police station, where Tony retrieves it after discovering that he has no key. The key from Margot's bag does not work, so he uses the hidden key to open the door, demonstrating his guilt. With his escape routes blocked by Hubbard and another policeman, Tony calmly makes himself a drink, congratulates Hubbard and admits defeat.

However, there were problems with the script and budget, and Hitchcock and Bernstein decided to dissolve their partnership. Warner Bros. allowed Hitchcock to scrap the film, and begin production on Dial M for Murder. Mark's name was changed for the film; in the original play, he was Max Halliday. Actors Dawson and Williams reprise their Broadway roles as Swann/Captain Lesgate and Inspector Hubbard, respectively. Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In Dial M for Murder, he can be seen thirteen minutes into the film, in a black-and-white reunion photograph, sitting at a banquet table among former students and faculty. Release Dial M for Murder was shot using Warner Bros.' own proprietary 3-D camera rig, the so-called All-Media Camera. After one preview performance on May 18 and four showings on the 19th, a Philadelphia theater manager frantically contacted the studio and said that people were staying away in droves. He asked for permission to drop the 3-D and show the film flat. On May 23, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that \\"[t]he first audiences proved to be a jury that could not only make up its mind, but could make it up in a hurry. In exhibitors' own terms, \\"DIAL M\\" literally died. And after just four performances on Wednesday, some long-distance telephoning to report complaints, the increasing skimpiness of customers‚Äîa good many of them making no bones of their dissatisfaction‚Äîpermission was given to throw away the glasses and hastily switch to the 2-D version. Whereupon business at the Randolph took a turn for the better.\\" Dial M for Murder marked the end of the brief flirtation with 3-D films of the early 1950s. Hitchcock said of 3-D, \\"It's a nine-day wonder, and I came in on the ninth day.\\" In February 1980, the dual-strip system was used for the revival of the film in 3D at the York Theater in San Francisco. This revival did so well that Warner Bros. did a limited national re-release of the film in February 1982, using Chris Condon's single-strip StereoVision 3-D system, including a sold out engagement at the Detroit Institute of Arts. The film was shown in 3D in some UK cinemas during the summer of 2013, and in Italy at the beginning of fall of the same year. ilcinemaritrovato.it Warner Bros. released Dial M for Murder as a 3D Blu-ray on October 9, 2012. Reception \\"This is a technical triumph that Hitchcock has achieved,\\" wrote Bosley Crowther of The New York Times in a favourable review. \\"It is one for which he needed good actors. He has them‚Äîand the best of the lot is John Williams, late of the stage play, who is the detective who solves the sinister ruse.\\" Variety wrote: \\"There are a number of basic weaknesses in the set-up that keep the picture from being a good suspense show for any but the most gullible. Via the performances and several suspense tricks expected of Hitchcock, the weaknesses are glossed over to some extent but not enough to rate the film a cinch winner.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote that the film \\"shapes up as no more than a mild entertainment, despite the expert direction of Hitchcock and the competent acting of the players. The chief weakness is that the action is slow, caused by the fact that the story unfolds almost entirely by dialogue.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called the film \\"completely choice,\\" with Williams and Dawson \\"smooth as silk in reprising their stage roles,\\" adding, \\"Hitch has a field day with his camera angles, darting our eyes now here, now there, doing tingling tricks with shadows and long longshots in quick contrast to fuzzed close-ups. It's the work of a master enjoying his script.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote a generally positive review, writing that he wished the script would give Hitchcock \\"a chance to cut loose with one of those spectacular chases he used to specialise in,\\" but finding that after a talky opening 30 minutes, \\"things speed up once the murder wheels are set in motion, and eventually the piece becomes grimly diverting.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the film \\"offers the prolific Hitchcock little more than an opportunity to carpenter a neat piece of filmed theatre‚Äîan opportunity which perhaps satisfied the master a little more than it does us ... The characters are fitted to their situations, and hardly exist in themselves (nor are they enlivened by the rather drab performances of Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings); only John Williams' dry, sardonic police inspector has a touch of individuality.\\" The film holds an approval rating of 88% on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Dial M for Murder may be slightly off-peak Hitchcock, but by any other standard, it's a sophisticated, chillingly sinister thriller  and one that boasts an unforgettable performance from Grace Kelly to boot\\". The film was listed by American Film Institute in 2001 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills (#48), and in 2008 in AFI's 10 Top 10 (#9 in Mysteries). Similar films and remakes As it is considered one of the classic examples of a stage thriller, it has been revived a number of times since, including a US TV film in 1981 with Angie Dickinson and Christopher Plummer. In 1958 the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) aired a television film in which Maurice Evans (as Tony), Williams and Dawson all repeated their roles from the original Broadway play. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) produced a two-hour colour version in 1968 featuring Laurence Harvey as Tony, Diane Cilento as Margot and Hugh O'Brian as Max.TV Guide, June 15‚Äì21, 1968, p. A-63 A Perfect Murder is a 1998 remake directed by Andrew Davis in which the characters of Halliday and Swann are combined, with the husband (Michael Douglas) both hiring and coercing his wife's lover (played by Viggo Mortensen) into a scheme to kill her (Gwyneth Paltrow). However, the lover hatches a revenge plot against the husband. Things go disastrously wrong for both of them, bringing in the cold, smoothly dogged police inspector (David Suchet), whose role is much reduced, as it is Gwyneth Paltrow's character, the wife, who unravels much of the mystery. The television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents premiered in the United States the year after Dial M for Murder was released. The main character in an episode from the series's first season, \\"Portrait of Jocelyn\\", is named Mark Halliday. In the episode, Halliday's wife, Jocelyn, has disappeared several years earlier, and at the conclusion, it is revealed that he murdered her. The original play was also adapted in the Soviet Union in 1981 under the title Tony Wendice's Mistake (–û—à–∏–±–∫–∞ –¢–æ–Ω–∏ –í–µ–Ω–¥–∏—Å–∞).Oshibka Toni Vendisa The film partially inspired a Hindi-language version in 1985, released as Aitbaar, starring Raj Babbar, Dimple Kapadia and Suresh Oberoi. A Tamil- language adaptation, titled Saavi, with Sathyaraj, Saritha, Jaishankar and Nizhalgal Ravi, was released in the same year. The film also inspired a Malayalam-language adaptation as New Year starring Jayaram, Urvashi and Suresh Gopi in 1989. Another Bollywood film, Humraaz (2002), starring Bobby Deol, Akshaye Khanna, and Amisha Patel, was inspired by A Perfect Murder. The episode \\"The Fifth Stair\\" of the TV series 77 Sunset Strip recreated Dial M for Murder, with Richard Long portraying Tony Wendice. The third episode of the sixth season of Frasier is titled \\"Dial M for Martin\\". The plot centres on the title character's father believing that his younger son is subconsciously trying to kill him when he is beset by a series of mishaps seemingly caused by Frasier's younger brother, Niles.

W., Hall, H. R., History of Egypt Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria in the Light of Recent Discovery, p. 117, The Echo Library, 2008.] also known as Damgalnuna or Ninmah, was the ancient Sumerian mother goddess of the mountains, and one of the seven great deities of Sumer. She is principally a fertility goddess. Temple hymn sources identify her as the \\"true and great lady of heaven\\" (possibly in relation to her standing on the mountain) and kings of Sumer were \\"nourished by Ninhursag's milk\\". Sometimes her hair is depicted in an omega shape and at times she wears a horned head-dress and tiered skirt, often with bow cases at her shoulders. Frequently she carries a mace or baton surmounted by an omega motif or a derivation, sometimes accompanied by a lion cub on a leash. She is the tutelary deity to several Sumerian leaders. Names Nin- hursag means \\"lady of the sacred mountain\\" (from Sumerian NIN \\"lady\\" and ·∏™AR.SAG \\"sacred mountain, foothill\\", possibly a reference to the site of her temple, the E-Kur (House of mountain deeps) at Eridu. She had many names including Ninmah (\\"Great Queen\\"); Nintu (\\"Lady of Birth\\"); Mamma or Mami (mother); Aruru (), Belet-Ili (lady of the gods, Akkadian) According to legend, her name was changed from Ninmah to Ninhursag by her son Ninurta in order to commemorate his creation of the mountains. As Ninmenna, according to a Babylonian investiture ritual, she placed the golden crown on the king in the Eanna temple. Some of the names above were once associated with independent goddesses (such as Ninmah and Ninmenna), who later became identified and merged with Ninhursag, and myths exist in which the name Ninhursag is not mentioned. Possibly included among the original mother goddesses was Damgalnuna (great wife of the prince) or Damkina (true wife), the consort of the god Enki.Jeremy A. Black, Anthony Green, Tessa Rickards, Gods, demons, and symbols of ancient Mesopotamia: an illustrated dictionary (1992), p. 56f. & 75 The mother goddess had many epithets including shassuru or 'womb goddess', tabsut ili 'midwife of the gods', 'mother of all children' and 'mother of the gods'. In this role she is identified with Ki in the Enuma Elish. She had shrines in both Eridu and Kish. Mythology In the legend of Enki and Ninhursag, Ninhursag bore a daughter to Enki called Ninsar (\\"Lady Greenery\\"). Through Enki, Ninsar bore a daughter Ninkurra (\\"Lady of the Pasture\\"). Ninkurra, in turn, bore Enki a daughter named Uttu. Enki then pursued Uttu, who was upset because he didn't care for her. Uttu, on her ancestress Ninhursag's advice buried Enki's seed in the earth, whereupon eight plants (the very first) sprung up. Enki, seeing the plants, ate them, and became ill in eight organs of his body. Ninhursag cured him, taking the plants into her body and giving birth to eight deities: Abu, Nintulla (Nintul), Ninsutu, Ninkasi, Nanshe, Azimua, Ninti, and Enshag (Enshagag). In the text 'Creator of the Hoe', she completed the birth of mankind after the heads had been uncovered by Enki's hoe. In creation texts, Ninmah (another name for Ninhursag) acts as a midwife whilst the mother goddess Nammu makes different kinds of human individuals from lumps of clay at a feast given by Enki to celebrate the creation of humankind. Worship Her symbol, resembling the Greek letter omega Œ©, has been depicted in art from approximately 3000 BC, although more generally from the early second millennium BC. It appears on some boundary stones‚Äîon the upper tier, indicating her importance. The omega symbol is associated with the Egyptian cow goddess Hathor, and may represent a stylized womb. The symbol appears on very early imagery from Ancient Egypt. Hathor is at times depicted on a mountain, so it may be that the two goddesses are connected. Her temple, the Esagila (from Sumerian E (temple) + SAG (head) + ILA (lofty)) was located on the KUR of Eridu, although she also had a temple at Kish.

The Roc appears in Arabic geographies and natural history, popularized in Arabian fairy tales and sailors' folklore. Ibn Battuta tells of a mountain hovering in the air over the China Seas, which was the Roc.Noted in Yule-Cordier, Cathay and the Way Thither IV (1916:146), noted by Wittkower 1938. The story collection One Thousand and One Nights includes tales of Abd al-Rahman and Sinbad the Sailor, both of which include the Roc. Etymology The English form roc originates via Antoine Galland's French from Arabic ru·∏µ·∏µ () and that from Persian ru·∏µ ().roc /[phonetic transcription]/ n. Also (earlier) ‚úùroche, ‚úùrock, ‚úùruc(k), ‚úùrukh. L16 [Sp. rocho, ruc f. Arab. ru·∏µ·∏µ, f. Pers. ru·∏µ.] A mythical bird of Eastern legend, imagined as being of enormous size and strength (The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Clarendon Press, Oxford, Volume 2 N-Z, 1993 edition, page 2614) In both languages, Arabic and Persian, the word is written in the Arabic script as ÿ±ÿÆ. Common romanizations are ru·∏µ·∏µ for the Arabic form and ru·∏µ, rokh or rukh for the Persian form. Despite the similarities and sometimes claims to the contrary, the word is not related to the English word rook. Eastern origins Illustration by Ren√© Bull According to art historian Rudolf Wittkower, the idea of the roc had its origins in the story of the fight between the Indian solar bird GarudaWittkower noted the identification of the roc and Garuda made in Kalipadra Mitra, \\"The bird and serpent myth\\", The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society (Bangalore) 16 1925‚Äì26:189. and the chthonic serpent NƒÅga. The mytheme of Garuda carrying off an elephant that was battling a crocodile appears in two Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata (I.1353) and the Ramayana (III.39). The merchants break the roc's egg, Le Magasin pitoresque, Paris, 1865  Western expansion  1690 painting by Franz R√∂sel von Rosenhof showing two roc-like birds carrying a deer and an elephant; a third grasps a lion. Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela reported a story reminiscent of the roc in which shipwrecked sailors escaped from a desert island by wrapping themselves in ox- hides and letting griffins carry them off as if they were cattle.M. Komroff, Contemporaries of Marco Polo 1928:311f. In the 13th century, Marco Polo (as quoted in Attenborough (1961: 32)) stated > It was for all the world like an eagle, but one indeed of enormous size; so > big in fact that its quills were twelve paces long and thick in proportion. > And it is so strong that it will seize an elephant in its talons and carry > him high into the air and drop him so that he is smashed to pieces; having > so killed him, the bird swoops down on him and eats him at leisure. Polo claimed that the roc flew to Madagascar \\"from the southern regions\\", and that the Great Khan sent messengers to the island who returned with a feather (likely a Raphia frond). He explicitly distinguishes the bird from a griffin. In The Arabian Nights the roc appears on a tropical island during Sinbad's second voyage. Because of Polo's account, others identified the island as Madagascar, which became the location for stories about other giant birds. Doubtless, it was Polo's description that inspired Antonio Pigafetta, one of Ferdinand Magellan's companions, who wrote or had ghost-written an embroidered account of the circumglobal voyage: in Pigafetta's accountOr the Italian version in Ramusio's Delle navigationi et viaggi, mentioned in Rudolf Wittkower, \\"'Roc': An Eastern Prodigy in a Dutch Engraving\\" Journal of the Warburg Institute 1.3 (January 1938:255‚Äì257) p 255 the home grounds of the roc were the seas of China. Such descriptions captured the imaginations of later illustrators, such as Stradanus ca 1590An engraving after Stradanus is reproduced in Wittkower 1938:fig 33c. or Theodor de Bry in 1594 who showed an elephant being carried off in the roc's talons,De Bry's engraving is reproduced in Attenborough (1961: 35) or showed the roc destroying entire ships in revenge for destruction of its giant egg, as recounted in the fifth voyage of Sinbad the Sailor. Ulisse Aldrovandi's Ornithologia (1599) included a woodcut of a roc with a somewhat pig-like elephant in its talons,Illustrated in Wittkower 1938:33, fig. b. but in the rational world of the 17th century, the roc was regarded more critically. Rationalized accounts The scientific culture of the 19th century introduced some \\"scientific\\" rationalizations for the myth's origins, by suggesting that the origin of the myth of the roc may lie in embellishments of the often-witnessed power of the eagle that could carry away a newborn lamb. In 1863, Bianconi suggested the roc was a raptor (Hawkins and Goodman, 2003: 1031). Recently a giant subfossil eagle, the Malagasy crowned eagle, identified from Madagascar was actually implicated as a top bird predator of the island, whose megafauna once included giant lemurs and pygmy hippopotamuses.Goodman, 1994 Aepyornis eggs, Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris Another possible origin of the myth is accounts of eggs of another extinct Malagasy bird, the enormous Aepyornis elephant bird, hunted to extinction by the 16th century, that was three meters tall and flightless. There were reported elephant bird sightings at least in folklore memory as √âtienne de Flacourt wrote in 1658. Its egg, live or subfossilised, was known as early as 1420, when sailors to the Cape of Good Hope found eggs of the roc, according to a caption in the 1456 Fra Mauro map of the world, which says that the roc \\"carries away an elephant or any other great animal\\". Between 1830 and 1840 European travelers in Madagascar saw giant eggs and egg shells. English observers were more willing to believe their accounts because they knew of the moa in New Zealand. In 1851 the French Academy of Sciences received three eggs. They and later fossils seemingly confirmed to 19th- century Europeans that Aepyornis was the roc, but the real bird does not resemble an eagle as the roc is said to. Elephant carried away by a roc after design by Stradanus, 1590 Another rationalizing theory is that the existence of rocs was postulated from the sight of the African ostrich, which, because of its flightlessness and unusual appearance, was mistaken for the chick of a presumably much larger species. Ostriches, however, were already well known in Biblical times. On the other hand, a medieval Northern European or Indian traveller, if confronted with tales about ostriches, might very well not have recognized them for what they were (compare History of elephants in Europe). In addition to Polo's account of the rukh in 1298, Chou Ch'≈±-fei (Âë®ÂéªÈùû, Zh≈çu Q√πfƒìi), in his 1178 book Lingwai Daida, told of a large island off Africa with birds large enough to use their quills as water reservoirs. Fronds of the raffia palm may have been brought to Kublai Khan under the guise of roc's feathers.Yule's Marco Polo, bk. iii. ch. 33, and Academy, 1884, No. 620.Attenborough, D. (1961). Zoo Quest to Madagascar. Lutterworth Press, London. p.32-33. Some recent scholars have compared the legendary roc with the Haast's eagle, of New Zealand. long with a wingspan, it became extinct around the 15th century, but probably inspired the MƒÅori legend of Te Hokioi or Te Hakawai. This was said to be a colorful huge bird which (in some versions of the legend) had occasionally descended to Earth to carry off humans to eat, but generally lived in the clouds unseen. Only its cry, after which it was named, could be heard. Indeed, the hokioi seems to be a composite mythical beast inspired by actual animals, just like the roc appears to have been. In the 1980s, it was foundMiskelly (1987), Galbreath & Miskelly (1988) that male Coenocorypha snipes, tiny nocturnal waders, produce an unexpectedly loud roaring sound with their tails during mating flights. The supposed coloration of the hokioi is not matched by any known bird, and generally would be extremely unusual for a bird of prey. Thus, as it seems likely that the hokioi was the eerie \\"drumming\\" of the snipes, explained with the ancestor's tales about the giant eagles which they still knew from living memory. Religious tradition =Michael Drayton= Through the 16th century the existence of the roc could be accepted by Europeans. In 1604, Michael Drayton envisaged the rocs being taken aboard the Ark: > All feathered things yet ever knowne to men, From the huge Rucke, unto the > little Wren; From Forrest, Fields, from Rivers and from Pons, All that have > webs, or cloven-footed ones; To the Grand Arke, together friendly came, > Whose severall species were too long to name. =Ethiopian= The rukh is also identified in the Ethiopian holy book Kebra Negast as the agent responsible for delivering the blessed piece of wood to King Solomon which enabled the great king to complete the Temple. This piece of wood also is said to have transformed the Queen of Sheba's foot from that of a goat to that of a human. The piece of wood that the rukh brought was therefore given an honored place in the Temple and decorated with silver rings. According to tradition, these silver rings were given to Judas Iscariot as payment for betraying Jesus; the piece of wood became Jesus's cross.

Zagreus, p. 456. However, in the earliest mention of Zagreus, he is paired with Gaia (Earth) and called the \\"highest\\" god [of the underworld?] and Aeschylus links Zagreus with Hades, possibly as Hades' son, or Hades himself.Sommerstein, p. 237 n. 1; Gantz, p. 118; Smyth, p. 459. Noting \\"Hades' identity as Zeus' katachthonios alter ego\\", Timothy Gantz thought it \\"likely\\" that Zagreus, originally, perhaps the son of Hades and Persephone, later merged with the Orphic Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone.Gantz, p. 119.  Etymology and origins  In Greek a hunter who catches living animals is called zagreus, Karl Ker√©nyi notes, and the Ionian word zagre signifies a \\"pit for the capture of live animals\\".Ker√©nyi, p. 82, quotes Hesychius, who gives characteristically Ionian Greek endings. \\"We may justifiably ask,\\" observes Kerenyi,Ker√©nyi, pp. 83‚Äì84. \\"Why was this great mythical hunter, who in Greece became a mysterious god of the underworld, a capturer of wild animals and not a killer?\\" Ker√©nyi links the figure of Zagreus with archaic Dionysiac rites in which small animals were torn limb from limb and their flesh devoured raw, \\"not as an emanation of the Greek Dionysian religion, but rather as a migration or survival of a prehistoric rite\\".Ker√©nyi, p. 85.  Underworld  The early mentions of Zagreus, which occur only in fragments from lost works,Gantz, p. 118; West 1983, p. 153. connect Zagreus with the Greek underworld. The earliest is in a single quoted line from the (6th century BC?) epic Alcmeonis: > Mistress Earth [Gaia], and Zagreus highest of all the gods. Perhaps here meaning the highest god of the underworld.Alcmeonis fr. 3. According to West 2003, p. 41 n. 17: \\"The line perhaps comes from a prayer in which Alcmaon called upon the powers of the earth to send up his father Amphiaraus.\\" And apparently for Aeschylus, Zagreus was, in fact, an underworld god. In a fragment from one of Aeschylus' lost Sisyphus plays (c. 5th century BC), Zagreus seems to be the son of Hades,Aeschylus, fr. 228 (Sommerstein, pp. 236, 237). while in Aeschylus' Egyptians (Aigyptioi), Zagreus was apparently identified with Hades himself.Aeschylus, fr. 5; Sommerstein, p. 237 n. 1; Gantz, p. 118; Smyth, p. 459. A fragment from Euripides' lost play Cretan Men (Kretes) has the chorus describe themselves as initiates of Idaean Zeus and celebrants of \\"night-ranging Zagreus, performing his feasts of raw flesh\\".Euripides, fr. 472 (Collard & Cropp, pp. 538, 539); West 1983, p. 153.  Orphic Dionysus Zagreus  Dionysus in a mosaic from the House of Poseidon, Zeugma Mosaic Museum The Zagreus from the Euripides fragment is suggestive of Dionysus, the wine god son of Zeus and Semele,West 1983, p. 154. and in fact, although it seems not to occur anywhere in Orphic sources, the name ‚ÄúZagreus‚Äù is elsewhere identified with an Orphic Dionysus, who had a very different tradition from the standard one.According to Gantz, p. 118, 'Orphic sources preserved seem not to use the name \\"Zagreus\\", and according to West 1983, p. 153, the 'name was probably not used in the Orphic narrative'. Edmonds 1999, p. 37 n. 6 says: 'Lobeck 1892 seems to be responsible for the use of the name Zagreus for the Orphic Dionysos. As Linforth noticed, \\"It is a curious thing that the name Zagreus does not appear in any Orphic poem or fragment, nor is it used by any author who refers to Orpheus\\" (Linforth 1941:311). In his reconstruction of the story, however, Lobeck made extensive use of the fifth- century CE epic of Nonnos, who does use the name Zagreus, and later scholars followed his cue. The association of Dionysos with Zagreus appears first explicitly in a fragment of Callimachus preserved in the Etymologicum Magnum (fr. 43.117 P), with a possible earlier precedent in the fragment from Euripides Cretans (fr. 472 Nauck). Earlier evidence, however, (e.g., Alkmaionis fr. 3 PEG; Aeschylus frr. 5, 228) suggests that Zagreus was often identified with other deities.' This Dionysus was a son of Zeus and Persephone who was, as an infant, attacked and dismembered by the Titans, but later reborn as the son of Zeus and Semele. = The sparagmos = The dismemberment of Dionysus-Zagreus (the sparagmos) is often considered to be the most important myth of Orphism.Nilsson, p. 202 calls it \\"the cardinal myth of Orphism\\"; Guthrie, p. 107, describes the myth as \\"the central point of Orphic story\\", Linforth, p. 307 says it is \\"commonly regarded as essentially and peculiarly Orphic and the very core of the Orphic religion\\", and Parker 2002, p. 495, writes that \\"it has been seen as the Orphic 'arch-myth'. As pieced together from various ancient sources, the reconstructed story, usually given by modern scholars, goes as follows.West 1983, pp. 73‚Äì74, provides a detailed reconstruction with numerous cites to ancient sources, with a summary on p. 140. For other summaries see Morford, p. 311; Hard, p. 35; Marsh, s.v. Zagreus, p. 788; Grimal, s.v. Zagreus, p. 456; Burkert, pp. 297‚Äì298; Guthrie, p. 82; also see Ogden, p. 80. For a detailed examination of many of the ancient sources pertaining to this myth see Linforth, pp. 307‚Äì364. The most extensive account in ancient sources is found in Nonnus, Dionysiaca 5.562‚Äì70, 6.155 ff., other principal sources include Diodorus Siculus, 3.62.6‚Äì8 (= Orphic fr. 301 Kern), 3.64.1‚Äì2, 4.4.1‚Äì2, 5.75.4 (= Orphic fr. 303 Kern); Ovid, Metamorphoses 6.110‚Äì114; Athenagoras of Athens, Legatio 20 Pratten (= Orphic fr. 58 Kern); Clement of Alexandria, Protrepticus 2.15 pp. 36‚Äì39 Butterworth (= Orphic frs. 34, 35 Kern); Hyginus, Fabulae 155, 167; Suda s.v. ŒñŒ±Œ≥œÅŒµœçœÇ. See also Pausanias, 7.18.4, 8.37.5. Zeus had intercourse with Persephone in the form of a serpent, producing Dionysus. He is taken to Mount Ida where (like the infant Zeus) he is guarded by the dancing Curetes. Zeus intended Dionysus to be his successor as ruler of the cosmos, but a jealous Hera incited the Titans to kill the child. Distracting the infant Dionysus with various toys, including a mirror, the Titans seized Dionysus and tore (or cut)West 1983, p. 160 remarks that while \\"many sources speak of Dionysus' being 'rent apart' ... those who use more precise language say that he was cut up with a knife\\". him to pieces. The pieces were then boiled, roasted and partially eaten, by the Titans. But Athena managed to save Dionysus' heart, by which Zeus was able to contrive his rebirth from Semele. Although the extant Orphic sources do not mention the name ‚ÄúZagreus‚Äù in connection with this dismembered Dionysus (or anywhere else), the (c. 3rd century BC) poet Callimachus perhaps did.Gantz, pp. 118‚Äì119; West 1983, pp. 152‚Äì154; Linforth, pp. 309‚Äì311. We know that Callimachus, as well as his contemporary Euphorion, told the story of the dismembered child,Callimachus, fr. 643 Pfeiffer (= Euphorion, fr. 14 Lightfoot); Gantz, p. 118‚Äì119; West 1983, p. 151; Linforth, pp. 309‚Äì310. and Byzantine sources, quote Callimachus, as referring to the birth of a ‚ÄúDionysos Zagreus‚Äù, explaining that ‚ÄúZagreus‚Äù was the poets‚Äô name for a chthonic Dionysus, the son of Zeus by Persephone.Callimachus, fr. 43.117 Pfeiffer (= fr. 43b.34 Harder); Harder, p. 368; Gantz, p. 118; West 1983, pp. 152‚Äì153; Linforth, p. 310. The first certain identification of Zagreus with the dismembered Dionysus, occurs in the writings of the late 1st century ‚Äì early 2nd century AD biographer and essayist Plutarch,Linforth, pp. 311, 317‚Äì318; Plutarch, The E at Delphi 389 A. while the c. 5th century AD Greek epic poet Nonnus' Dionysiaca, which tells the story of this Orphic Dionysus, calls him the \\"older Dionysos ... illfated Zagreus\\",Nonnus, Dionysiaca 5.564‚Äì565. \\"Zagreus the horned baby\\",Nonnus, Dionysiaca 6.165. \\"Zagreus, the first Dionysos\\",Nonnus, Dionysiaca 10.294. \\"Zagreus the ancient Dionysos\\",Nonnus, Dionysiaca 39.72. and \\"Dionysos Zagreus\\".Nonnus, Dionysiaca 44.255. The 1st century BC historian Diodorus Siculus says that according to ‚Äúsome writers of myths‚Äù there were two gods named Dionysus, an older one, who was the son of Zeus and Persephone,Diodorus Siculus, 4.4.1. but that the ‚Äúyounger one [born to Zeus and Semele] also inherited the deeds of the older, and so the men of later times, being unaware of the truth and being deceived because of the identity of their names thought there had been but one Dionysus.\\"Diodorus Siculus, 4.4.5. According to Diodorus, this older Dionysus, was represented in painting and sculpture with horns, because he ‚Äúexcelled in sagacity and was the first to attempt the yoking of oxen and by their aid to effect the sowing of the seed‚Äù,Diodorus Siculus, 4.4.2, see also 3.64.1‚Äì2. and the younger was ‚Äúcalled Dimetor (Of Two Mothers) ‚Ä¶ because the two Dionysoi were born of one father, but of two mothers‚Äù.Diodorus Siculus, 3.64.2, 4.4.5. He also said that Dionysus ‚Äúwas thought to have two forms ‚Ä¶ the ancient one having a long beard, because all men in early times wore long beards, the younger one being youthful and effeminate and young.\\"Diodorus Siculus, 4.5.2. Cooking / eating Several accounts of the myth involved the Titans cooking and/or eating at least part of Dionysus.Linforth, pp. 312‚Äì313; West 1983, pp. 160‚Äì161. In the account attributed to Callimachus and Euphorion, the dismembered pieces of Dionysus were boiled in a cauldron, and Euphorion is quoted as saying that the pieces of Dionysus were placed over a fire.Callimachus, fr. 643 Pfeiffer (= Euphorion, fr. 14 Lightfoot). Diodorus also says that the pieces were \\"boiled\\",Diodorus Siculus, 3.62.6. and the late 2nd century Christian writer Clement of Alexandria says that the pieces were \\"first boiled\\" in a cauldron, then pierced with spits and roasted.Clement of Alexandria, Protrepticus 2.15 pp. 38, 39 Butterworth (= Orphic fr. 35 Kern). Arnobius, an early 4th century Christian apologist, says that Dionysus' severed parts were \\"thrown into pots that he might be cooked\\".Arnobius, Adversus Gentes 5.19 (p. 242) (= Orphic fr. 34 Kern). None of these sources mention any actual eating, but other sources do. Plutarch says that the Titans \\"tasted his blood\\",Plutarch, On the Eating of Flesh 996 B‚ÄìC. the 6th century AD Neoplatonist Olympiodorus says that they ate \\"his flesh\\",Olympiodorus, In Plato Phaedon 1.3 (= Orphic fr. 220 Kern); translated by Edmonds 1999, p. 40. and according to the 4th century euhemeristic account of the Latin astrologer and Christian apologist Firmicus Maternus, the Titans cooked the \\"members in various ways and devoured them\\" (membra consumunt), except for his heart.Firmicus Maternus, De errore profanarum religionum (\\"The Error of Pagan Religions\\") 6.1‚Äì5 pp. 54‚Äì56 Forbes (= Orphic fr. 214 Kern). Resurrection / rebirth In the version of the story apparently told by Callimachus and Euphorion, the cauldron containing the boiled pieces of Dionysus, is given to Apollo for burial, who \\"stowed it away beside his tripod\\" at Delphi.Callimachus, fr. 643 Pfeiffer (= Euphorion, fr. 14 Lightfoot); West 1983, p. 151; Linforth, pp. 311‚Äì312. And according to Philodemus, citing Euphorion, the pieces of Dionysus were \\"reassembled by Rhea, and brought back to life\\", while according to Diodorus Siculus, the reassembly and resurrection of Dionysus was accomplished by Demeter.Euphorion, fr. 40 Lightfoot (= Orphic fr. 36 Kern) (compare with Cornutus, Theologiae Graecae Compendium 30 p. 62, 11 Lang which also has Rhea rivive Dionysus); Diodorus Siculus, 3.62.6. Some Orphic texts identify Demeter and Rhea, see West 1983, pp. 72‚Äì74, 81‚Äì82, 93, 217. Later Orphic sources have Apollo receive Dionysus' remains from Zeus, rather than the Titans, and it was Apollo who reassembled Dionysus, rather than Rhea or Demeter.West 1983, p. 152; Linforth, p. 315; Orphic frs. 34, 35, 209‚Äì211 Kern. In the accounts of Clement, and Firmicus Maternus cited above, as well as Proclus,Proclus, Hymn to Athena 13‚Äì24; In Plato Timaeus 35a (Taylor 1820b, pp. 37‚Äì38) (= Orphic fr. 210 Kern). and a scholium on Lycophron 355,Linforth, p. 311; Tzetzes, Scholiast on Lycophron Alexandra 355 p. 137 Scheer. Athena manages to save the heart of Dionysus, from which, according to Clement and the scholium, Athena received the name Pallas from the still beating (œÄŒ¨ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ) heart. In Proculus' account Athena takes the heart to Zeus, and Dionysus Is born again from Semele. According to Hyginus, Zeus \\"ground up his heart, put it in a potion, and gave it to Semele to drink\\", and she became pregnant with Dionysus.Hyginus, Fabulae 167. Osiris In the interpretatio graeca Dionysus is often identified with the Egyptian god Osiris.Rutherford, p. 67. Stories of the dismemberment and resurrection of Osiris, parallel those of Dionysus Zagreus.Rutherford, p. 69. According to Diodorus Siculus,Diodorus Siculus, 4.6.3. Egyptian myths about Priapus said that the Titans conspired against Osiris, killed him, divided his body into equal parts, and \\"slipped them secretly out of the house\\". All but Osiris' penis, which since none of them \\"was willing to take it with him\\", they threw into the river. Isis, Osiris' wife, hunted down and killed the Titans, reassembled Osiris' body parts \\"into the shape of a human figure\\", and gave them \\"to the priests with orders that they pay Osiris the honours of a god\\". But since she was unable to recover the penis she ordered the priests \\"to pay to it the honours of a god and to set it up in their temples in an erect position.\\"DIodorus, 1.21.1-3, relates another version of the Osiris story which more closely parallels the usual Egyptian account of the murder and dismemberment of Osiris by his brother Set. In this account Typhon (whom the Greeks had come to identified with Set) killed his brother Osiris, the lawful king of Egypt, and cut the body of the slain Osiris into twenty-six pieces, giving one piece to each of his accomplices, so that they all would share equally in the \\"pollution\\". But Osiris' sister and wife, Isis, with the help of her son Horus, killed Typhon and became queen. Allegorical accounts Diodorus Siculus reports an allegorical interpretation of the myth of the dismemberment of Dionysus as representing the production of wine. Diodorus knew of a tradition whereby this Orphic Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Demeter, rather than Zeus and Persephone.Edmonds 1999, p. 51; Linforth, p. 316; Diodorus Siculus, 3.62.6‚Äì8 (= Orphic fr. 301 Kern); 3.64.1. This parentage was explained allegorically by identifying Dionysus with the grape vine, Demeter with the earth, and Zeus with the rain, saying that \\"the vine gets its growth both from the earth and from rains and so bears as its fruit the wine which is pressed out from the clusters of grapes\\". According to Diodorus, Dionysus' dismemberment by the Titans represented the harvesting of the grapes, and the subsequent \\"boiling\\" of his dismembered parts \\"has been worked into a myth by reason of the fact that most men boil the wine and then mix it, thereby improving its natural aroma and quality.\\" The Neronian-era Stoic Cornutus relates a similar allegorical interpretation, whereby the dismemberment represented the crushing of the grapes, and the rejoining of the dismembered pieces into a single body, represented the pouring of the juice into a single container.Linforth, pp. 316-317; Edmonds 1999, p. 51 n. 46; Cornutus, Theologiae Graecae Compendium 30 Lang. Rationalized accounts Diodorus also reports a rationalized account of the older Dionysus.Diodorus Siculus, 3.64.1-2. In this account this Dionysus was a wise man, who was the inventor of the plough, as well as many other agricultural inventions. And according to Diodorus, these inventions, which greatly reduced manual labor, so pleased the people that they \\"accorded to him honours and sacrifices like those offered to the gods, since all men were eager, because of the magnitude of his service to them, to accord to him immortality.\\" Firmicus Maternus gives a rationalized euhemeristic account of the myth whereby Liber (Dionysus) was the bastard son of a Cretan king named Jupiter (Zeus). When Jupiter left his kingdom in the boy's charge, the king's jealous wife Juno (Hera), conspired with her servants the Titans to murder the bastard child. Beguiling him with toys, the Titans ambushed and killed the boy. To dispose of the evidence of their crime, the Titans chopped the body into pieces, cooked, and ate them. However the boy's sister Minerva (Athena), who had been part of the murder plot, kept the heart. When her father the king returned, the sister turned informer and gave the boy's heart to the king. In his fury the king tortured and killed the Titans, and in his grief, he had a statue of the boy made, which contained the boy's heart in its chest, and a temple erected in the boy's honor. The Cretans, In order to pacify their furious savage and despotic king, established the anniversary of the boy's death as a holy day. Sacred rites were held, in which the celebrants howling and feigning insanity tore to pieces a live bull with their teeth, and the basket in which boy's heart had been saved, was paraded to the blaring of flutes and the crashing of cymbals.Firmicus Maternus, De errore profanarum religionum 6.1-5 pp. 54-56 Forbes (= Orphic fr. 214 Kern); Linforth, pp. 313-314, 315. = The anthropogony = Most sources make no mention of what happened to the Titans after the murder of Dionysus. In the standard account of the Titans, given in Hesiod's Theogony (which does not mention Dionysus), after being overthrown by Zeus and the other Olympian gods, in the ten-year-long Titanomachy, the Titans are imprisoned in Tartarus.Hesiod, Theogony 630-721. This might seem to preclude any subsequent story of the Titans' killing Dionysus,West 1983, p. 164; Spineto, p. 34. and perhaps in an attempt to reconcile this standard account with the Dionysus Zagreus myth, according to Arnobius and Nonnus, the Titans end up imprisoned by Zeus in Tartarus, as punishment for their murder of Dionysus.Arnobius, Adversus Gentes 5.19 (p. 242) (= Orphic fr. 34 Kern); Nonnus, Dionysiaca 6.206-210. However, according to one source, from the fate of the Titans came a momentous event, the birth of humankind. Commonly presented as a part of the myth of the dismembered Dionysus Zagreus, is an Orphic anthropogony, that is an Orphic account of the origin of human beings. According to this widely held view, as punishment for the crime of the sparagmos, Zeus struck the Titans with his thunderbolt, and from the remains of the destroyed Titans humankind was born, which resulted in a human inheritance of ancestral guilt, for this original sin of the Titans, and by some accounts \\"formed the basis for an Orphic doctrine of the divinity of man.\\"Linforth, pp. 307-308; Spineto, p. 34. For presentations of the myth which include the anthropogony, see Dodds, pp. 155‚Äì156; West 1983, pp. 74‚Äì75, 140, 164‚Äì166; Guthrie, p. 83; Burkert, pp. 297‚Äì298; Marsh, s.v. Zagreus, p. 788; Parker 2002, pp. 495‚Äì496; Morford, p. 313. However, when and to what extent there existed any Orphic tradition which included these elements is the subject of open debate.See Spineto pp. 37‚Äì39; Edmonds 1999, 2008, 2013 chapter 9; Bernab√© 2002, 2003; Parker 2014. The only ancient source to explicitly connect the sparagmos and the anthropogony is the 6th century AD Neoplatonist Olympiodorus, who writes that, according to Orpheus, after the Titans had dismembered and eaten Dionysus, \\"Zeus, angered by the deed, blasts them with his thunderbolts, and from the sublimate of the vapors that rise from them comes the matter from which men are created.\\" Olympiodorus goes on to conclude that, because the Titans had eaten his flesh, we their descendants, are a part of Dionysus.Edmonds 1999, p. 40; Olympiodorus, In Plato Phaedon 1.3 (= Orphic fr. 220 Kern); Spineto p. 34; Burkert, p. 463 n. 15; West 1983, pp. 164‚Äì165; Linforth, pp. 326 ff.. The 2nd century AD biographer and essayist Plutarch, does make a connection between the sparagmos and the punishment of the Titans, but makes no mention of the anthropogony, or Orpheus, or Orphism. In his essay On the Eating of Flesh, Plutarch writes of \\"stories told about the sufferings and dismemberment of Dionysus and the outrageous assaults of the Titans upon him, and their punishment and blasting by thunderbolt after they had tasted his blood\\".Plutarch, On the Eating of Flesh 1.996 C; Linforth, pp. 334 ff. Edmonds 1999, pp. 44‚Äì47. Earlier allusions to the myth possibly occur in the works of the poet Pindar, Plato, and Plato's student Xenocrates. A fragment from a poem, presumed to be by Pindar, mentions Persephone accepting \\"requital for ancient wrong\\", from the dead, which might be a reference to humans' inherited responsibility for the Titan's killing of Dionysus.Pindar , fr. 133 Bergk, apud Plato, Meno 81bc (= fr. 127 Bowra); This interpretation, first proposed by H. J. Rose, is discussed by Linforth, pp. 345‚Äì350, who while raising several objections and giving other possible explanations, concludes by saying \\"but after all, and in spite of these objections, one must acknowledge that there is a high degree of probability in Rose's interpretation.\\" Others have agreed: Dodds, pp. 155‚Äì156, says the line is \\"most naturally explained as referring to human responsibility for the slaying of Dionysus\\", Burkert, p. 298, says this \\"ancient grief\\" of Persephone \\"can only be the death of her child Dionysos\\"; Parker 2002, p. 496 says \\"No myth is known which really explains the allusion except that of the murder of Persephone's son Dionysus by man's ancestors\\". However, West 1983, p. 110 n. 82, Seaford, pp. 7‚Äì8, who sees \\"difficulties\\" in Rose's interpretation\\", and Edmonds 1999, pp. 47‚Äì49, who rejects Rose's reading, all offer different interpretations. Plato, in presenting a succession of stages whereby, because of excessive liberty, men degenerate from reverence for the law, to lawlessness, describes the last stage where \\"men display and reproduce the character of the Titans of story\\".Plato, Laws 3.701bc (= Orphic fr. 9 Kern). This Platonic passage is often taken as referring to the anthropogony, however, whether men are supposed by Plato to \\"display and reproduce\\" this lawless character because of their Titanic heritage, or by simple imitation, is unclear.Linforth, pp. 339‚Äì345; Edmonds 1999, pp. 43‚Äì44; Edmonds 2013, pp. 326‚Äì334. Xenocrates' reference to the Titans (and perhaps Dionysus) to explain Plato's use of the word \\"custody\\" (œÜœÅŒøœçœÅŒ±), has also been seen as possible evidence of a pre-Hellenistic date for the myth.Xenocrates, fr. 20 Heinze (= Damascius, In Phaedo 1.2); Linforth, pp. 337‚Äì339; Dodds, p. 156; West 1983, pp. 21‚Äì22; Burkert, p. 298; Edmonds 1999, p. 46; Parker 2002, p. 496  Notes   References  * Arnobius, The Seven Books of Arnobius Adversus Gentes, translated by Archibald Hamilton Bryce and Hugh Campbell, Edinburg: T. & T.

Staatliche Antikensammlungen, Munich, Germany Dancing Maenad Roman copy of Greek original attributed to Kallimachos circa 425-400 BCE at the Metropolitan Museum of Art In Greek mythology, maenads (; ) were the female followers of Dionysus and the most significant members of the Thiasus, the god's retinue. Their name literally translates as \\"raving ones\\". Maenads were known as Bassarids, Bacchae , or Bacchantes in Roman mythology after the penchant of the equivalent Roman god, Bacchus, to wear a bassaris or fox skin. Often the maenads were portrayed as inspired by Dionysus into a state of ecstatic frenzy through a combination of dancing and intoxication. During these rites, the maenads would dress in fawn skins and carry a thyrsus, a long stick wrapped in ivy or vine leaves and tipped with a pine cone. They would weave ivy-wreaths around their heads or wear a bull helmet in honor of their god, and often handle or wear snakes.Abel, Ernest L. (2006). Intoxication in Mythology: A Worldwide Dictionary of Gods, Rites, Intoxicants, and Place. Jefferson, NC and London: McFarland & Co., Inc. These women were mythologized as the \\"mad women\\" who were nurses of Dionysus in Nysa. Lycurgus \\"chased the Nurses of the frenzied Dionysus through the holy hills of Nysa, and the sacred implements dropped to the ground from the hands of one and all, as the murderous Lycurgus struck them down with his ox-goad\\".Homer, Iliad, VI.130ff, in E.V. Rieu's translation. They went into the mountains at night and practiced strange rites. According to Plutarch's Life of Alexander, maenads were called Mimallones and Klodones in Macedon, epithets derived from the feminine art of spinning wool.According to Grace Harriet Macurdy, \\"Klodones, Mimallones and Dionysus Pseudanor,\\" The Classical Review 27.6 (September 1913), pp. 191-192, and Troy and Paeonia. With Glimpses of Ancient Balkan History and Religion, 1925, p. 166. Nevertheless, these warlike parthenoi (\\"virgins\\") from the hills, associated with a Dionysios pseudanor \\"fake male Dionysus\\", routed an invading enemy.According to the second-century CE Macedonian military writer Polyaenus, IV.1; Polyaenus gives a fanciful etymology.. In southern Greece they were described as Bacchae, Bassarides, Thyiades, Potniades,Potnia means \\"lady\\" or \\"mistress\\". and other epithets.Harrison, Jane Ellen (1922). \\"The Maenads\\". Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, 3rd ed. p.388-400. The term maenad has come to be associated with a wide variety of women, supernatural, mythological, and historical,Jane Ellen Harrison remarked of the 19th-century (male) classicists, \\"so persistent is the dislike to commonplace fact, that we are repeatedly told that the maenads are purely mythological creations and that the maenad orgies never appear historically in Greece.\\" Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, 3rd ed.

British Museum, London In Euripides' play The Bacchae, maenads of Thebes murder King Pentheus after he bans the worship of Dionysus. Dionysus, Pentheus' cousin, himself lures Pentheus to the woods, where the maenads tear him apart. His corpse is mutilated by his own mother, Agave, who tears off his head, believing it to be that of a lion. A group of maenads also kill Orpheus.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Library and Epitome, 1.3.2. \\"Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having been torn in pieces by the maenads he is buried in Pieria.\\" In ceramic art, the frolicking of Maenads and Dionysus is often a theme depicted on kraters, used to mix water and wine. These scenes show the maenads in their frenzy running in the forests, often tearing to pieces any animal they happen to come across. German philologist Walter Friedrich Otto writes: Cult worship =Bacchanalia= Cultist rites associated with worship of the Greek god of wine, Dionysus (or Bacchus in Roman mythology), were characterized by maniacal dancing to the sound of loud music and crashing cymbals, in which the revelers, called Bacchantes, whirled, screamed, became drunk and incited one another to greater and greater ecstasy. The goal was to achieve a state of enthusiasm in which the celebrants‚Äô souls were temporarily freed from their earthly bodies and were able to commune with Bacchus/Dionysus and gain a glimpse of and a preparation for what they would someday experience in eternity. The rite climaxed in a performance of frenzied feats of strength and madness, such as uprooting trees, tearing a bull (the symbol of Dionysus) apart with their bare hands, an act called sparagmos, and eating its flesh raw, an act called omophagia. This latter rite was a sacrament akin to communion in which the participants assumed the strength and character of the god by symbolically eating the raw flesh and drinking the blood of his symbolic incarnation. Having symbolically eaten his body and drunk his blood, the celebrants became possessed by Dionysus. Two satyrs and a maenad.

Dionysus and two Maenads as depicted by the Amasis painter circa 550-530 BC. =Priestesses of Dionysus= \\"Maenads\\" are found in later references as priestesses of the Dionysian cult. In the third century BC, when an Asia Minor city wanted to create a maenadic cult of Dionysus, the Delphic Oracle bid them to send to Thebes for both instruction and three professional maenads, stating, \\"Go to the holy plain of Thebes so that you may get maenads who are from the family of Ino, daughter of Cadmus. They will give to you both the rites and good practices and they will establish dance groups (thiasoi) of Bacchus in your city.\\" Myths Dionysus came to his birthplace, Thebes, where neither Pentheus, his cousin who was now king, nor Pentheus‚Äô mother Agave, Dionysus‚Äô aunt (Semele's sister) acknowledged his divinity. Dionysus punished Agave by driving her insane, and in that condition, she killed her son and tore him to pieces. From Thebes, Dionysus went to Argos where all the women except the daughters of King Proetus joined in his worship. Dionysus punished them by driving them mad, and they killed the infants who were nursing at their breasts. He did the same to the daughters of Minyas, King of Orchomenos in Boetia, and then turned them into bats. According to Opian, Dionysus delighted, as a child, in tearing kids into pieces and bringing them back to life again. He is characterized as \\"the raging one\\" and \\"the mad one\\" and the nature of the maenads, from which they get their name, is, therefore, his nature.Otto, Walter F. (1965). Dionysus: Myth and Cult. Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press. p.135 Once during a war in the middle of the third century BC, the entranced Thyiades (maenads) lost their way and arrived in Amphissa, a city near Delphi. There they sank down exhausted in the market place and were overpowered by a deep sleep. The women of Amphissa formed a protective ring around them and when they awoke arranged for them to return home unmolested. The Women of Amphissa by Lawrence Alma-Tadema On another occasion, the Thyiades were snowed in on Parnassos and it was necessary to send a rescue party. The clothing of the men who took part in the rescue froze solid. It is unlikely that the Thyiades, even if they wore deerskins over their shoulders, were ever dressed more warmly than the men.Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life; translated from the German by Ralph Manheim; Bollingen Series LXV 2; Princeton University Press 1976. pg. 220. =Nurses and nymphs= In the realm of the supernatural is the category of nymphs who nurse and care for the young Dionysus, and continue in his worship as he comes of age. The god Hermes is said to have carried the young Dionysus to the nymphs of Nysa. In another myth, when his mother, Semele, is killed, the care of young Dionysus falls into the hands of his sisters, Ino, Agave, and Autonoe, who later are depicted as participating in the rites and taking a leadership role among the other maenads. =Resisters to the new religion= Maenad and Satyr. Ancient Greek kylix by Makron, 490-480 BC. Staatliche Antikensammlungen M√ºnchen Kat. 94 The term \\"maenads\\" also refers to women in mythology who resisted the worship of Dionysus and were driven mad by him, forced against their will to participate in often horrific rites. The doubting women of Thebes, the prototypical maenads or \\"mad women\\", left their homes to live in the wilds of the nearby mountain Cithaeron. When they discovered Pentheus spying on them, dressed as a maenad, they tore him limb from limb.Euripides, The Bacchae This also occurs with the three daughters of Minyas, who reject Dionysus and remain true to their household duties, becoming startled by invisible drums, flutes, cymbals, and seeing ivy hanging down from their looms. As punishment for their resistance, they become madwomen, choosing the child of one of their number by lot and tearing it to pieces, as the women on the mountain did to young animals. A similar story with a tragic end is told of the daughters of Proetus. =Voluntary revelers= Not all women were inclined to resist the call of Dionysus, however. Maenads, possessed by the spirit of Dionysus, traveled with him from Thrace to mainland Greece in his quest for the recognition of his divinity. Dionysus was said to have danced down from Parnassos accompanied by Delphic virgins, and it is known that even as young girls the women in Boeotia practiced not only the closed rites but also the bearing of the thyrsus and the dances. The possible foundation myth is the very ancient festival called Agrionia. According to Greek authors like Plutarchos women followers of Dyonisos went in search of him and when they could not find him prepared a feast. A feature of this festival was recorded by Plutarch. A priest would chase a group of virgins down with a sword. These women were supposed to be descendants of the women who sacrificed their son in the name of Dionysios. The priest caught one of the woman and executed her. This type of human sacrifice was later omitted from the festival. Eventually the women would be freed from the madness and return to Thebes and their usual lives, but for the time of the festival they would have had an intense ecstatic experience. The Agrionia was celebrated in several Greek cities, but especially in Boeotia. Each Boeotian city had its own distinct foundation myth for it, but the pattern was much the same: the arrival of Dionysus, resistance to him, flight of the women to a mountain, the killing of Dionysus‚Äô persecutor, and eventual reconciliation with the god. Art Jean Metzinger, 1906, La danse, Bacchante, oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm. The subject of maenads remained popular in the arts at least into the early 20th century Maenads have been depicted in art as erratic and frenzied women enveloped in a drunken rapture, the most obvious example being that of Euripides‚Äô play The Bacchae. His play, however, is not a study of the cult of Dionysus or the effects of this religious hysteria of these women. The maenads have often been interpreted in art in this way. To understand the play of Euripides one must only know about the religious ecstasy called Dionysiac, the most common moment maenads are displayed in art. In Euripides' play and other art forms and works, the Dionysiac only needs to be understood as the frenzied dances of the god which are direct manifestations of euphoric possession and that these worshipers, sometimes by eating the flesh of a man or animal who has temporarily incarnated the god, come to partake of his divinity. In addition to Euripides' The Bacchae, depictions of maenads are often found on both red and black figure Greek pottery, statues, and jewelry. Also, fragments of reliefs of female worshipers of Dionysus have been discovered at Corinth.Richardson, Rufus B. \\"A Group of Dionsiac Sculptures from Corinth\\". American Journal of Archaeology 8, no.3 (July‚ÄìSeptember 1904): 288-296. Mark W. Edwards in his paper \\"Representation of Maenads on Archaic Red-Figure Vases\\" traces the evolution of maenad depictions on red figure vases. Edwards distinguishes between \\"nymphs\\" which appear earlier on Greek pottery and \\"maenads\\" which are identified by their characteristic fawnskin or nebris and often carry snakes in their hands. However, Edwards does not consider the actions of the figures on the pottery to be a distinguishing characteristic for differentiation between maenads and nymphs. Rather, the differences or similarities in their actions are more striking when comparing black figure and red figure pottery, as opposed to maenads and nymphs.Edwards, Mark W. \\"Representation of Maenads on Archaic Red-Figure Vases\\".

Later culture =Books and comics= A maenad appears in Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem \\"Ode to the West Wind\\". In Ivan Turgenev's novella First Love, Bacchantes are used symbolically in a dream of Princess Zinaida. Maenads, along with Bacchus and Silenus, appear in C. S. Lewis' Prince Caspian. They are portrayed as wild, fierce girls who dance and perform somersaults. Maenadism is referenced by the 2013 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Canadian Alice Munro, in her collection of short stories titled Runaway (2004). No explanation is offered for the significance of this reference, but the independence and power of this cultist group of women, would seem to be a metaphor for the autonomy needed by women in the modern age, to better stake out a claim against an oppressive patriarchy; a claim many women seem to be all too willing to forgo. Poul Anderson's \\"Goat Song\\" depicts a far-future utopia where all human activity has been \\"optimized\\" by the artificial intelligence SUM. To placate their fear of dying, citizens of this utopia are promised resurrection using DNA and memory records collected by bracelets that everyone wears. Rebelling against nonhuman control, one citizen called Harper (identified with Orpheus) awakens atavism in a group of women who spend holidays in the wild living as maenads. The short story \\"Las M√©nades\\" by Julio Cort√°zar, originally published in Final del juego in 1956, describes a concert in which the narrator does not react emotionally to the music, but a number of women are overwhelmed with emotion and surge onto the stage, overtaking the conductor and musicians. In Piers Anthony's Xanth series, the maenads are depicted as women frenzied with bloodlust. The maenads were temporarily quelled by Magician Grey as his talent is nullification of magic. In combination with a large python protecting the Oracle's Cave, the maenads presence is to protect Mount Parnassus (see \\"Man from Mundania\\"). In Fables & Reflections, the seventh volume of Neil Gaiman's comic series The Sandman, the maenads feature in the story Orpheus, in which they gruesomely murder the titular character after he refuses to cavort with them (echoing the events of the actual Greek myth of Orpheus). In the horror novel Dominion by Bentley Little, maenads are eventually revealed as the main antagonists for the first half of the story, during which they tear their victims to shreds and conspire to reawaken Dionysus. The Buffy the Vampire Slayer novel Go Ask Malice: A Slayer's Diary depicts maenads as corrupted human beings in service of the ancient and powerful Greek vampire Kakistos.Walton, J. Michael, Found in translation: Greek drama in English, Cambridge University Press, 2006. Confer p. 128. The maenads appear in Rick Riordan's The Demigod Diaries where they are the principal enemies in the story \\"Leo Valdez and the Quest for Buford\\". While looking for the automaton table, Buford, Leo, Jason, and Piper run into the maenads, who are searching for Dionysus. They chase Leo and Piper into Bunker 9 and are subsequently captured in a golden net. In Sailor Moon, the two priestesses guarding the shrine of Elysium deep within the Earth (the most sacred place of the Golden Kingdom) are called maenads. However, they have nothing in common with the mythological maenads: they are not frenzied or dangerous, their number is stable, don't travel (in fact they seem to be forbidden from leaving), and are not in anyway connected with Dionysus/Bacchus (no reference to this god is ever made in the entire franchise). They are instead connected with a character named after the Greek personification of the sun (Helios). The short story \\"Last Call\\" of Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files features a maenad as a primary antagonist. William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Bacchante, 1894. =Opera and television= The Bassarids (composed 1964‚Äì65, premiered 1966), to a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is the most famous opera composed by Hans Werner Henze. Charlaine Harris' The Southern Vampire Mysteries novels and its television adaptation, HBO's True Blood (2nd season, aired in summer 2009), feature maenads in the characters of Callisto and Maryann, respectively. In the show, Maryann wishes to sacrifice Sam Merlotte in hopes of summoning her god, Dionysus.TVguide.com Maryann is portrayed by Michelle Forbes. Maenads appear in \\"A Girl By Any Other Name\\", an episode of Atlantis. They also appear in season 4 of The Magicians, where they party alongside Bacchus and nurse him through his magical ailments. =Real life= Maenads are the adopted symbol of Tetovo in North Macedonia, depicted prominently of the city's coat of arms. The inclusion of maenad imagery dates to 1932 when a small statuette of a maenad, dating to the 6th century BC, was found in the city. The \\"Tetovo Maenad\\" was featured on the reverse of a Macedonian 5000 denar banknote issued in 1996.National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. Macedonian currency.

It premiered posthumously at the Theatre of Dionysus in 405 BC as part of a tetralogy that also included Iphigeneia at Aulis and Alcmaeon in Corinth, and which Euripides' son or nephew is assumed to have directed.Rehm (1992, 23). It won first prize in the City Dionysia festival competition. The tragedy is based on the Greek myth of King Pentheus of Thebes and his mother Agave, and their punishment by the god Dionysus (who is Pentheus's cousin). The god Dionysus appears at the beginning of the play and proclaims that he has arrived in Thebes to avenge the slander, which has been repeated by his aunts, that he is not the son of Zeus. In response, he intends to introduce Dionysian rites into the city, and he intends to demonstrate to the king, Pentheus, and to Thebes that he was indeed born a god.Murray Gilbert. Euripides and His Age. Oxford University Press. 1965. At the end of the play, Pentheus is torn apart by the women of Thebes and his mother Agave bears his head on a pike to her father Cadmus.Corrigan, Robert W. editor.

Bovie, Palmer, editor. Epstein, Daniel Mark, translator. Euripides, 1. University of Pennsylvania Press. 1998. The Bacchae is distinctive in that the chorus is integrated into the plot and the god is not a distant presence, but a character in the play, indeed, the protagonist.Euripides. Slavitt, David R., editor. Bovie, Palmer, editor. Epstein, Daniel Mark, translator. Euripides, 1. University of Pennsylvania Press. 1998. Various interpretations The Bacchae has been the subject of widely varying interpretations regarding what the play as a whole means, or even indeed whether there is a ‚Äúmoral‚Äù to the story. The extraordinary beauty and passion of the poetic choral descriptions indicate that the author certainly knew what attracted those who followed Dionysus. And the vivid gruesomeness of the punishment of Pentheus suggests that he could also understand those who were troubled by the religion.Corrigan, Robert W. editor. Classical Tragedy Greek and Roman; Eight Plays in Authoritative Modern Translations. Euripides. Bagg, Robert, translator. The Bakkhai. Applause Theatre Book Publishers. 1990. At one time the interpretation that prevailed was that the play was an expression of Euripides‚Äô religious devotion, as though after a life of being critical of the Greek gods and their followers, the author finally repented of his cynicism, and wrote a play that honors Dionysus and that carries a dire warning to anyone who doesn't believe. Then, at the end of the 19th century the opposite idea began to take hold; it was thought that Euripides was doing with The Bacchae what he had always done, pointing out the inadequacy of the Greek gods and religions.Winnington-Ingram, R. P. Euripides and Dionysus, an Interpretation of the Bacchae. Bristol Classical Press. 1997. Background The Dionysus in Euripides' tale is a young god, angry that his mortal family, the royal house of Cadmus, has denied him a place of honor as a deity. His mortal mother, Semele, was a mistress of Zeus who while pregnant, was killed by Hera, who was jealous of her husband's affair. When Semele died, her sisters said it was Zeus' will and accused her of lying; they also accused their father, Cadmus, of using Zeus as a coverup. Most of Semele's family refuse to believe Dionysus is the son of Zeus, and the young god is spurned in his home. He has traveled throughout Asia and other foreign lands, gathering a cult of female worshipers (Maenads or Bacchantes). At the play's start he has returned, disguised as a stranger, to take revenge on the house of Cadmus. He has also driven the women of Thebes, including his aunts, into an ecstatic frenzy, sending them dancing and hunting on Mount Cithaeron, much to the horror of their families. Complicating matters, his cousin, the young king Pentheus, has declared a ban on the worship of Dionysus throughout Thebes.Euripides, Bacchae, 1‚Äì64 Plot The play begins before the palace at Thebes, with Dionysus telling the story of his birth and his reasons for visiting the city. Dionysus explains he is the son of a mortal woman, Semele, and a god, Zeus. Some in Thebes, he notes, don't believe this story. In fact, Semele's sisters‚ÄîAutonoe, Agave, and Ino‚Äîclaim it is a lie intended to cover up the fact that Semele became pregnant by some mortal. Dionysus reveals that he has driven the women of the city mad, including his three aunts, and has led them into the mountains to observe his ritual festivities. He has disguised himself as a mortal for the time being, but he plans to vindicate his mother by appearing before all of Thebes as a god, the son of Zeus, and establishing his permanent cult of followers. Dionysus exits to the mountains, and the chorus (composed of the titular Bacchae) enters. They perform a choral ode in praise of Dionysus. Then Tiresias, the blind and elderly seer, appears. He calls for Cadmus, the founder and former king of Thebes. The two old men start out to join the revelry in the mountains when Cadmus‚Äô petulant young grandson Pentheus, the current king, enters. Disgusted to find the two old men in festival dress, he scolds them and orders his soldiers to arrest anyone engaging in Dionysian worship, including the mysterious \\"foreigner\\" who has introduced this worship. Pentheus intends to have him stoned to death.Euripides. Vellacott, Philip, translator. The Bacchae and Other Plays. Penguin Books. 1954. . p. 198. The guards soon return with Dionysus himself in tow. Pentheus questions him, both skeptical of and fascinated by the Dionysian rites. Dionysus's answers are cryptic. Infuriated, Pentheus has Dionysus taken away and chained to an angry bull in the palace stable. But the god now shows his power. He breaks free and razes the palace with an earthquake and fire. Dionysus and Pentheus are once again at odds when a herdsman arrives from the top of Mount Cithaeron, where he had been herding his grazing cattle. He reports that he found women on the mountain behaving strangely: wandering the forest, suckling animals, twining snakes in their hair, and performing miraculous feats. The herdsmen and the shepherds made a plan to capture one particular celebrant, Pentheus' mother. But when they jumped out of hiding to grab her, the Bacchae became frenzied and pursued the men. The men escaped, but their cattle were not so fortunate, as the women fell upon the animals, ripping them to shreds with their bare hands. The women carried on, plundering two villages that were further down the mountain, stealing bronze, iron and even babies. When villagers attempted to fight back, the women drove them off using only their ceremonial staffs of fennel. They then returned to the mountain top and washed up, as snakes licked them clean.Euripides. Vellacott, Philip, translator. The Bacchae and Other Plays. Penguin Books. 1954. . p. 218. Pencil illustration from 2020 depicting Dionysus leading Pentheus into the forest disguised as a maenad Dionysus, still in disguise, persuades Pentheus to forgo his plan to defeat and massacre the women with an armed force. He says it would be better first to spy on them, while disguised as a female Maenad to avoid detection.Euripides. Ten Plays by Euripides. Trans. Moses Hadas and John Mclean. New York: Bantam Books, 1981, p. 299 Dressing Pentheus in this fashion, giving him a thyrsus and fawn skins, Dionysus leads him out of the house. At this point, Pentheus seems already crazed by the god's power, as he thinks he sees two suns in the sky, and believes he now has the strength to rip up mountains with his bare hands. He has also begun to see through Dionysus' mortal disguise, perceiving horns coming out of the god's head. They exit to Cithaeron. A messenger arrives to report that once the party reached Mount Cithaeron, Pentheus wanted to climb an evergreen tree to get a better view and the stranger used divine power to bend down the tall tree and place the king in its highest branches. Then Dionysus, revealing himself, called out to his followers and pointed out the man in the tree. This drove the Maenads wild. Led by Agave, his mother, they forced the trapped Pentheus down from the tree top, ripped off his limbs and his head, and tore his body into pieces. After the messenger has relayed this news, Agave arrives, carrying her son's bloodied head. In her god- maddened state, she believes it is the head of a mountain lion. She proudly displays it to her father, Cadmus, and is confused when he does not delight in her trophy, but is horrified by it. Agave then calls out for Pentheus to come marvel at her feat, and nail the head above her door so she can show it to all of Thebes. But now the madness begins to wane, and Cadmus forces her to recognize that she has destroyed her own son. As the play ends, the corpse of Pentheus is reassembled as well as is possible, the royal family devastated and destroyed. Agave and her sisters are sent into exile, and Dionysus decrees that Cadmus and his wife Harmonia will be turned into snakes and leads a barbarian horde to plunder the cities of Hellas.Euripides.

Significant quotations :Dionysus: \\"It's a wise man's part to practise a smooth-tempered self-control.\\" :Dionysus: \\"Your [Pentheus'] name points to calamity. It fits you well.\\" (The name \\"Pentheus\\" derives from œÄŒ≠ŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ, p√©nthos, grief) :Messenger: \\"Dionysus' powers are manifold; he gave to men the vine to cure their sorrows.\\" :Dionysus: \\"Can you, a mortal, measure your strength against a god?\\" :Dionysus: ‚ÄúIt hurts you to kick against the goad [pricks].‚Äù Religious significance The ancient Greek concept of religion was very different from the concept as it is generally known today. The Greek gods did not demand worship. Instead they merely demanded to be recognized and accepted as a part of the human experience.Euripides. Vellacott, Phillip, translator. The Bacchae and Other Plays. Penguin Books Ltd. 1979 The scene of Dionysus being brought before King Pentheus to be interrogated regarding his claim of divinity has been compared to Jesus's interrogation by Pontius Pilate.Powell, Barry B. A Short Introduction to Classical Myth. Prentice Hall. 2001 Dramatic structure In the play's climactic plot construction, Dionysus the protagonist instigates the unfolding action by simultaneously emulating the play's author, costume designer, choreographer and artistic director.Teevan (2001, 4) Helene P. Foley, writing of the importance of Dionysus as the central character and his effect on the play's structure, observes: \\"The poet uses the ritual crisis to explore simultaneously god, man, society, and his own tragic art. In this protodrama Dionysus, the god of the theatre, stage-directs the play.\\"Scully (1987, 321) At the play's start, Dionysus' exposition highlights the play's central conflict: the invasion of Greece by an Asian religion.Johnston (2001) Criticism Until the late 19th century, the play's themes were considered too gruesome to be studied and appreciated. It was Nietzsche's \\"Birth of Tragedy\\" in 1872 that re-posed the question of Dionysus's relation with the theatre and awakened interest in The Bacchae. In the 20th century, performances became quite fashionable‚Äîparticularly in opera, due in part to the dramatic choruses found throughout the story.Morwood (2008, x‚Äìxi) In 1948, R.P. Winnington-Ingram said of Euripides' handling of the play: \\"On its poetical and dramatic beauties, he writes with charm and insight; on more complex themes, he shows equal mastery.\\"Norwood (1949, 317) Recent criticism has been provided by P.E. Easterling, et al. in The Cambridge Companion to Greek Tragedy. Influences The Bacchae had an enormous impact on ancient literature, and its influence can be seen in numerous Greek and Roman authors.Courtney J. P. Friesen, Reading Dionysus: Euripides' Bacchae and the Cultural Contestations of Greeks, Jews, Romans, and Christians (T√ºbingen 2015). It seems to have been one of Horace's favorite tragedies.Philip Whaley Harsh, A Handbook of Classical Drama, p. 237, (Stanford University Press). Beyond antiquity, dramatists and filmmakers of all ages have been greatly impacted by it. The tragedy's influence can be seen in the writings of Henrik Ibsen,Norman Rhodes, Ibsen and the Greeks, p. 76, (Bucknell University Press) as well as Thomas Mann's 1912 novella Death in Venice and Oliver Stone's 2004 film Alexander.

Bacchae, The Category:Theban mythology Category:Culture of Macedonia (ancient kingdom) Category:Dionysus Category:Plays set in ancient Greece Category:Greek plays adapted into films ","title":"The Bacchae"},{"id":"77239","text":"In Greek mythology, Pentheus (; ) was a king of Thebes. His father was Echion, the wisest of the Spartoi. His mother was Agave, the daughter of Cadmus, the founder of Thebes, and the goddess Harmonia. His sister was Epeiros. Much of what is known about the character comes from the interpretation of the myth in Euripides' tragic play, The Bacchae. Mythological biography Ino and Agave, lekanis lid, ca. 450-450 BC, Louvre. The story of Pentheus' resistance to Dionysus and his subsequent punishment is presented by Euripides as follows. Cadmus, the king of Thebes, abdicated due to his old age in favor of his grandson Pentheus. Pentheus soon banned the worship of the god Dionysus, who was the son of his aunt Semele, and did not allow the women of Cadmeia to join in his rites. An angered Dionysus caused Pentheus' mother Agave and his aunts Ino and Autono√´, along with all the other women of Thebes, to rush to Mount Cithaeron in a Bacchic frenzy. Because of this, Pentheus imprisoned Dionysus, thinking the man simply a follower, but his chains fell off and the jail doors opened for him. Dionysus, disguised as a woman, lured Pentheus out to spy on the Bacchic rites, where Pentheus expected to see sexual activities. The daughters of Cadmus saw him in a tree and thought him to be a wild animal. They pulled Pentheus down and tore him limb from limb (as part of a ritual known as the sparagmos). When his true identity was later discovered, officials exiled the women from Thebes. Some say that his own mother was the first to attack him, tearing his arm off and then tearing off his head. She placed the head on a stick and took it back to Thebes, but only realized whose head it was after meeting her father Cadmus. The name \\"Pentheus\\", as Dionysus and Tiresias both point out, means \\"Man of Sorrows\\" and derives from œÄŒ≠ŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ, p√©nthos, sorrow or grief, especially the grief caused by the death of a loved one. His name appeared to mark him for tragedy. Pentheus was succeeded by his uncle Polydorus. Before or possibly after Pentheus was killed, his wife gave birth to a son named Menoeceus, who became the father of Creon and Jocasta. He became the grandfather of Oedipus. The story of Pentheus is also discussed by Ovid in his Metamorphoses (3. 511‚Äì733). Ovid's version diverges from Euripides' work in several areas. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, King Pentheus is warned by the blind seer Tiresias to welcome Bacchus or else \\"Your blood [will be] poured out and defile the woods and your mother and her sisters...\\" Pentheus dismisses Tiresias and ignores his warnings. As Thebes succumbs to the \\"dementia and the delirium of the new god\\", Pentheus laments the fall of his kingdom and demands the arrest of Bacchus. His guards instead arrest Acoetes of Maeonia, a sailor who confirms the divinity of Bacchus and tells how the crew of his ship ended up being turned into dolphins after trying to kidnap the young god. Pentheus, convinced that Acoetes is lying, tries to throw him in jail. But when the guards try to shackle Acoetes, the chains fall off. In a rage, Pentheus ran to deal with Bacchus himself. He charged through the woods straight into a bacchanal. Driven to a frenzy the participants thought Pentheus was a boar and attacked him. His mother was the first one to spear him and then the group tore his flesh apart with their bare hands.

He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News \\"Innovator of the Year\\" award, and was named one of Newsweeks \\"50 Men Who Changed America.\\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is on the board of Anti-Aging Games. In 2012 he founded an educational software company called Brainrush, that is using video game technology in educational software. Nolan is credited with Bushnell's Law, an aphorism about games \\"easy to learn and difficult to master\\" being rewarding. Personal life Bushnell enrolled at Utah State University in 1961 to study engineering and then later business. In 1964, he transferred to the University of Utah College of Engineering, where he graduated with a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He was one of many computer science students of the 1960s who played the historic Spacewar! game on DEC mainframe computers. Bushnell worked at Lagoon Amusement Park for many years while attending college. He was made manager of the games department two seasons after starting. He was particularly interested in the Midway arcade games, where theme park customers would have to use skill and luck to ultimately achieve the goal and win the prize. He liked the concept of getting people curious about the game and from there getting them to pay the fee in order to play. He would use his love for games and theme parks to help launch both Atari and Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza- Time Theaters. While in college, he worked for several employers, including Litton Guidance and Control Systems, Hadley Ltd, and the industrial engineering department at the University of Utah. For several summers, he built his own advertising company, Campus Company, which produced blotters for four universities and sold advertising space around a calendar of events. He also sold copies of Encyclopedia Americana. Bushnell's first marriage was to Paula Rochelle Nielson, with whom he has 2 children. Bushnell's oldest child, Alissa, worked with him at uWink. His second marriage was to Nancy, with whom he has 6 children. Bushnell was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) but is no longer an active member.Games people play A 1999 Time article described him as a \\"lapsed Mormon\\" and described him smoking a pipe, which is inconsistent with the LDS Church's health practice of the Word of Wisdom. After selling Atari to Warner Communications for $28 million, Bushnell purchased the former mansion of coffee magnate James Folger in Woodside, California, which he shared with his wife Nancy and their eight children. The Bushnells now live in Southern California. In June 2008 it was announced that Leonardo DiCaprio would portray Bushnell in the film Atari, an adaptation of Bushnell's life story. Despite the announcement, however, no progress has been made on the project. Business career =Syzygy= In 1969, Bushnell and colleague Ted Dabney formed Syzygy with the intention of producing a Spacewar clone known as Computer Space. Dabney built the prototype and Bushnell shopped it around, looking for a manufacturer. They made an agreement with Nutting Associates, a maker of coin-op trivia and shooting games, that produced a fiberglass cabinet for the unit that included a coin- slot mechanism. Computer Space was a commercial failure, though sales exceeded $3 million. Bushnell felt that Nutting Associates had not marketed the game well, and decided that his next game would be licensed to a bigger manufacturer. =Atari, Inc.= The Magnavox Odyssey provided the inspiration for Bushnell's successful Pong. In 1972, Bushnell and Dabney set off on their own, and learned that the name \\"Syzygy\\" was in use; Bushnell has said at different times that it was in use by a candle company owned by a Mendocino hippie commune and by a roofing company. They instead incorporated under the name Atari, a reference to a check-like position in the game Go (which Bushnell has called his \\"favorite game of all time\\"). They rented their first office on Scott Boulevard in Sunnyvale, California, contracted with Bally Manufacturing to create a driving game, and hired their second employee, engineer Allan Alcorn. Bushnell later bought out Dabney, who was forced out after Nolan told him he would transfer all the assets to another corporation and leave Ted with nothing. After Bushnell attended a Burlingame, California demonstration of the Magnavox Odyssey, he gave the task of making the Magnavox tennis game into a coin-op version to Alcorn as a test project. He told Alcorn that he was making the game for General Electric, in order to motivate him, but in actuality he planned to simply dispose of the game. Alcorn incorporated many of his own improvements into the game design, such as the ball speeding up the longer the game went on, and Pong was born. Pong proved to be very popular; Atari released a large number of Pong-based arcade games over the next few years as the mainstay of the company. The Atari 2600 would go on to revolutionize the home gaming market, but Bushnell was forced out of Atari not long after its release. In 1974, Atari entered the consumer electronics market after engineers Harold Lee and Bob Brown approached Alcorn with an idea to develop a home version of Pong. With a marketing and distribution agreement with Sears, Pong sales soared when the unit was released in 1975. Using borrowed parts from Atari, having the main PCB printed up by Atari employee Howard Cantin, and receiving further assistance from Atari employee Ron Wayne, two non-employees, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak‚Äîboth of whom had previously been involved in the development of the Atari arcade game Breakout‚Äîcreated and marketed their own home computer. They offered the design to Bushnell, but Atari had no desire to build computers at the time, instead focusing on the arcade and home console markets. In 1976, Steve Jobs went to Nolan to get him to put in some money in exchange for a minor equity stake in Apple. Nolan remarked, \\"Steve asked me if I would put $50,000 in and he would give me a third of the company. I was so smart, I said no. It's kind of fun to think about that, when I'm not crying.\\"Book \\"Steve Jobs\\" by Walter Isaacson, Simon & Schuster, 2011, Pg.75 By 1976, Atari was in the midst of developing the Atari VCS (Video Computer System, later renamed the Atari 2600), but Bushnell realized that if the company was going to grow, it needed capital, and with the stock market in a bleak condition, going public would not be the solution. He made a list of companies to approach to buy Atari. Meanwhile, Steve Ross, CEO of Warner Communications, noticed that his children were hovering around video game cabinets at Walt Disney World. Warner Communications was contacted about Atari by one of its investors to discuss purchasing the company. For $28 million, Warner Communications (now WarnerMedia) bought Atari, bringing the capital they needed for the VCS launch, which took place in August 1977. In November 1978, Bushnell was forced out of the company after a dispute with Warner over its future direction, notably on the lifespan of the Atari 2600 and their closed software strategy, which was later changed for the new home computer division. By 1982, Atari had US$1.3 billion in annual sales and was the fastest-growing company in the history of American business. By 1984, the company had crashed and was split into three pieces to be sold off. The coin- op division became Atari Games. The Consumer division was sold to Jack Tramiel, who folded it into his Tramel Technology, Ltd., which was then renamed Atari Corporation. The budding Ataritel division was sold to Mitsubishi Electric. =Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre= In 1977, while at Atari, Bushnell purchased Pizza Time Theatre back from Warner Communications. It had been created by Bushnell, originally as a place where kids could go and eat pizza and play video games, which would therefore function as a distribution channel for Atari games. Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre also had animatronic animals that played music as entertainment. It is known that Bushnell had always wanted to work for Walt Disney, but was continually turned down for employment when he was first starting out after graduation; Chuck E. Cheese was his homage to Disney and the technology developed there. In 1981 Bushnell turned over day-to-day food operations of Chuck E. Cheese's to a newly hired restaurant executive and focused on Catalyst Technologies. Through 1981 and 1982, Bushnell concentrated on PTT subsidiaries Sente Technologies and Kadabrascope. Sente was a reentry into the coin-operated game business. Arcade cabinets would have a proprietary system and a cartridge slot developed by Data East Corporation, so operators could refresh their games without having to buy whole new cabinets. Kadabrascope was an early attempt at computer assisted animation. In 1983 as the restaurants started to lose money, Sente, though profitable, was sold to Bally for $3.9 million and Kadabrascope was sold to Lucas which became the beginnings of what became Pixar. During this time Bushnell was using large loans on his Pizza Time stock to fund Catalyst. By the end of 1983, Chuck E. Cheese was having serious financial problems. President and long-time friend Joe Keenan resigned that fall. Nolan tried to step back in, blaming the money problems on over- expansion, too much tweaking of the formula and saturation in local markets by the management team. He resigned in February 1984, when the board of directors rejected his proposed changes. Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theaters (now named after its famous rat mascot) entered bankruptcy in the fall of 1984. ShowBiz Pizza Place, a competing Pizza/Arcade family restaurant, then purchased Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre and assumed its debt. The newly formed company, ShowBiz Pizza Time, operated restaurants under both brands before unifying all locations under the Chuck E. Cheese brand by 1992. Today over 500 locations of this restaurant are in business. =Catalyst Technologies Venture Capital Group= Bushnell founded Catalyst Technologies, one of the earliest business incubators. The Catalyst Group companies numbered in the double digits and included Androbot, Etak, Cumma, and Axlon. Axlon launched many consumer and consumer electronic products successfully, most notably AG Bear, a bear that mumbled/echoed a child's words back to him/her. In the late 1980s, Axlon managed the development of two new games for the Atari 2600, most likely as part of a marketing attempt to revive sales of the system, already more than a decade old. The company was largely sold to Hasbro. Etak, founded in 1984, was the first company to digitize the maps of the world, as part of the first commercial automotive navigation system; the maps ultimately provided the backbone for Google maps, mapquest.com, and other navigation systems; it was sold to Rupert Murdoch in the 1980s. In May 2000 the company, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tele Atlas. While many of the ideas eventually led to current- day innovations, most of Catalyst's companies eventually failed due to a lack of underlying technology available in the 1980s to sustain these high-tech innovations. For example, Catalyst's companies included CinemaVision, which attempted to develop high definition television. Cumma attempted to distribute video games using special vending machines that would write the game onto discs on demand. ByVideo developed an early online shopping experience using kiosks and Laser Discs that allowed shoppers to virtually purchase products that would then be delivered later. =PlayNet/Aristo= In 1996 Nolan Bushnell became senior consultant to the small game developer Aristo International after it bought Borta, Inc. where he was Chairman.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/782145/0000910680-96-000010.txt Aristo's CEO and Chairman was Mouli Cohen. In association with Aristo, Bushnell spearheaded TeamNet, a line of multiplayer-only arcade machines targeted towards adults, which allowed teams of up to four players to compete either locally or remotely via internet. Aristo was later renamed PlayNet. Borta Inc. Developed video games that included versions of Urban Strike and Jungle Strike along with online Sports Games. Aristo developed two main products: a touchscreen interface bar-top/arcade system that would also provide internet access, phone calls, and online networked tournaments; and a digital jukebox, capable of storing thousands of songs and downloading new releases. The company died shortly before the dot-com bubble burst with its prototype machines still in development in 1997. =uWink= Before BrainRush, Bushnell's most recent company was uWink, a company that evolved out of an early project called In10City (pronounced 'Intensity') which was a concept of an entertainment complex and dining experience. uWink was started by Bushnell and his business adviser Loni Reeder, who also designed the original logo for the company. The company has gone through several failed iterations including a touch-screen kiosk design, a company to run cash and prize awards as part of their uWin concept and also an online Entertainment Systems network. After nearly 7 years and over $24 million in investor funding, the touchscreen kiosks/bartop model was closed amid complaints of unpaid prizes and lack of maintaining service agreements with locations to keep the kiosk/bartop units in working condition. The latest iteration (announced in 2005) is a new interactive entertainment restaurant called the uWink Media Bistro, whose concept builds off his Chuck E. Cheese venture and previous 1988‚Äì1989 venture Bots Inc., which developed similar systems of customer-side point-of-sale touch-screen terminals in addition to autonomous pizza delivery robots for Little Caesar's Pizza. The plan was for guests to order their food and drinks using screens at each table, on which they may also play games with each other and watch movie trailers and short videos. The multiplayer network type video games that allowed table to table interaction or even with table group play never materialized. Guests often spotted the OSX based machine being constantly re-booted in order to play much simpler casual video games. Another factor that possibly led to the failure of the restaurants was the placement of the restaurants. The Woodland Hills location was on the second floor of a suburban shopping mall and the Hollywood location practically hidden with minimal visibility on a higher level of a shopping center complex. The first Bistro opened in Woodland Hills, California on October 16, 2006. A second in Hollywood was established, and in 2008 the company opened a third Southern California restaurant and one in Mountain View, California, in Silicon Valley. All the restaurants have since closed. =Atari, SA= On April 19, 2010 Atari announced Nolan Bushnell along with Tim Virden would join the company's board of directors.Nolan Bushnell, Tom Virden, Join Atari Board of Directors , That Gaming Site, 19 April 2010 = Modal VR = Bushnell is also one of the founders of Modal VR a company that develops a portable large-scale VR system for enterprises to train e.g. security forces. = Anti-Aging Games, LLC = Nolan is on the advisory board of Anti-AgingGames.com and was a Co-Founder of the company, featuring online memory, concentration, and focus games for healthy people over 35. = BrainRush = BrainRush is a company that uses video game technology in educational software where he is Founder, CEO and Chairman. The company was venture capital funded in 2012. It is based on the idea that many curriculum lessons can be turned into mini-games. Developers can take any body of knowledge from English language arts to foreign language, geography, multiplication table or chemistry tables, to parts of the human body and gamify the experience. BrainRush calls their underlying technology \\"Adaptive Practice.\\" They have also developed an open-authoring system allowing users to quickly create games in different topic areas. Between 2010 and 2012, BrainRush ran a test in Spanish language vocabulary learning with over 2200 teachers and 80,000 students across the country and got an increase in learning speed of between 8‚Äì10 times traditional learning. BrainRush rolled out the full platform in the Fall of 2013. = Global Gaming Technologies Corp (CSE - GGAM.U) = On March 6, 2019, Nolan was appointed CEO and Chairman of publicly traded company Global Gaming Technologies Corp. Other ventures * In 1981, Bushnell created the TimberTech Computer Camp in Scotts Valley, California. *Nolan Bushnell's 67ft boat Charley (Ron Holland design, 1983)In 1982, Bushnell commissioned Charley, a 67-foot racing yacht designed by Ron Holland. Charley went on to win Line Honours in the 1983 TransPacific Yacht Race. * In 1984, Bushnell purchased the arcade game company Videa and renamed it Sente Games. Among the games developed by the company before its close in 1987 included the hockey video game Hat Trick. * In 1991, Bushnell endorsed the Commodore International CDTV, a CD-ROM-based version of the Amiga 500 computer repackaged for the consumer electronics market. * In Summer 1995 Bushnell announced a new line of amusement centers called E2000, which would be similar to Chuck E. Cheese's, but based on a video game theme. However, an unrelated multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed against Bushnell by Merrill Lynch prompted most of E2000's investors to back out, leaving him unable to fund the project. * In June 1999, Bushnell joined the board of directors of Wave Systems Corp. * In 2005, he served as a judge on the USA Network reality series Made in the USA. * In 2007, Bushnell joined the board of NeoEdge Networks as Chairman. * In 2007, Bushnell joined the advisory board of GAMEWAGER. * In 2008, Bushnell became a member of AirPatrol Corporation's board of directors. * In 2009, Bushnell announced his intention to move into the game-education market with a venture called Snap. He also announced that he would make an appearance at SGC, a gaming convention organized by ScrewAttack. * In May 2016, Bushnell joined the board of directors of MGT Capitol Investments. John McAfee, proposed Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MGT Capital, stated, \\"Nolan is one of the brightest minds in cyber technology. In his career, he has founded more than 20 high tech companies, giving him unprecedented knowledge of the tech industry. As a director, he will help MGT identify and cultivate the necessary strategic partnerships to position the company as the world leader in cyber security.\\" * In January 2017, Bushnell joined the board of directors of Perrone Robotics, a maker of robotics software platforms for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots. Media appearances Bushnell was featured in the documentary film Something Ventured about venture capital development, as well as Atari: Game Over, which documented the unearthing of the Atari video game burial. He was also featured in animated TV show Code Monkeys in Episode 3 of Season 1.  Accolades  Bushnell is considered to be the \\"father of electronic gaming\\" due to his contributions in establishing the arcade game market and creation of Atari. There had been debate between whether Bushnell or Ralph H. Baer, who is credited with creating the first home video game console, should be considered the father of video games, which had led to some bad blood between the two inventors. However, the industry recognized that Baer should be considered the father of home video gaming, while Bushnell is credited with innovating the arcade game. At the British Academy Video Games Awards on March 10, 2009, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded the Academy Fellowship to Bushnell in recognition of his outstanding achievement as a founding father of the video games industry. =Biographical film= Since 2008, there has been interest to a biographical film about Bushnell's life. While Bushnell had been approached by others to make such a film and turned these offers down, he accepted an offer made by Paramount Pictures in June 2008 with a script by Craig Sherman and Brian Hecker, with Leonardo DiCaprio envisioned to star as Bushnell. While news of the film was quiet over the next ten years, in March 2018, film financing company Vision Tree was working to start an initial coin offering for cryptocurrency to raise up to for the film, which was set to be produced by DiCaprio's studio Appian Way Productions, Vision Tree, and Avery Productions. =GDC Pioneer Award controversy= In January 2018, the Advisory Committee of the Game Developers Choice Awards announced that Bushnell would receive the Pioneer Award at the March ceremony at the Game Developers Conference (GDC), crediting his role at Atari. That day, several people through social media, including Brianna Wu, claimed Bushnell fostered a toxic work environment at Atari for women that became the foundation for the then-future video game industry, based on several documented interviews and accounts of Atari at the time of the 1970s and 1980s; a notable example was of Bushnell holding board meetings in a hot tub and invited female secretaries to join them. Wu and others asserted that while Bushnell had done much for the industry, recognizing him with this type of award during the ongoing #MeToo movement was sending the wrong message. Wu stated, \\"Nolan Bushnell deserves to be honored, but this is not the right time for it. It's easy to draw a line between the culture he created at Atari and the structural sexism women in tech face today.\\" The hashtag \\"#NotNolan\\" was shared by those with similar complaints about the GDC's choice. The following day, the Advisory Committee reconsidered the selection of Bushnell for the award and announced the Pioneer Award would not be awarded, and instead it would be used that year to \\"honor the pioneering and unheard voices of the past\\". GDC further stated that they believed their selections \\"should reflect the values of today's game industry\\". Bushnell released a statement agreeing with the Committee's decision: In a later statement to Kotaku, Bushnell cautioned that \\"exploring these kinds of issues through a finite, 40-year-old prism [does not offer] a productive reflection of our company\\", and referred to feedback from his former employees. Kotaku spoke to a dozen female former Atari employees, some whom had already spoken out on social media. All who agreed that while the company's 1970s and 1980s workplace was influenced by the broader Sexual Revolution, the allegations made against Bushnell were exaggerated or false, and that the culture was one that they all freely participated in. Some of the more notable female employees of Atari spoke further of the situation at the company and Bushnell during the 1970s: * Elaine Shirley, who worked at Atari during the Bushnell years, said, \\"Those were the times. He [Nolan Bushnell] hit on women and they hit on him. If the #MeToo movement was active when Atari was alive, I think half our company would be charged. To my knowledge, no one ever did anything they did not want to do.\\" * Loni Reeder, who was responsible for communications, security, and facilities at Atari and later cofounded uWink with Bushnell, stated, \\"I was treated fairly and paid well. I have fellow Atari women friends who also know Nolan. None of us were offended by him.\\" Reeder further stated of the workplace at Atari, \\"I take great offense of people coming in today and saying we were oppressed...We had a united and cohesive environment. That was what the ‚Äô70s were about. It wasn't like we all got together to have an orgy.\\" * Carol Kantor, the first games user researcher and who led an all-female games user research team at Atari, said, \\"I know there are people out there who are accused and really were guilty of sexual harassment. But not Nolan. It wasn't in his character. I certainly stand up for the Nolan that I knew. He certainly didn't hold his power over people.\\" The women interviewed by Kotaku generally considered the attack and decision related to Bushnell's award as unfair, and expressed anger at those that had raised the issue with the Committee. Some stated that those who accused Bushnell of sexism did not take into consideration the culture of the time, and there was a clear and distinct difference between the sexualized occurrences at Atari in the 1970s, and the real harassment and threats faced by women in the current #MeToo movement. The situation has led to discussion of how the Atari workplace may have influenced the current video game industry. Kotaku observed that the percentage of females in the video game industry has declined since 1991 to as low as 15% as of 2016, which is difficult to attribute, but suggested may be tied to a portion of women that would not be able to withstand the type of workplace of the 1980s Atari. In an editorial, Dean Takahashi suggested the current environment within the video game industry was more heavily influenced by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, which took drastically different approaches to workplace culture.

Released on June 19, 2000 as a lower-cost offering to complement AMD's then mainstream performance Athlon processor line, it also competed with rival chipmaker Intel's Pentium III and Celeron processor offerings. The Duron brand name was retired in 2004, succeeded by the Sempron line of processors as AMD's budget offering. Performance The original Duron processors were derived from AMD's mainstream Athlon Thunderbird processors, the primary difference being a reduction in L2 cache size to 64 KB from the Athlon's 256 KB. This was a relatively severe reduction, making it even smaller than the 128 KB L2 available on Intel's competing budget Celeron line. However, the originating Thunderbird architecture already featured one of the largest L1 caches at 128 KB (which was not reduced in the Duron) and also introduced AMD's switch to an exclusive cache design which effectively unified the L1 and L2 caches. Because of this, the Duron behaved as if it had a high speed 128 KB cache combined with a somewhat slower 64 KB segment giving an effective 192 KB cache, versus the traditional inclusive cache design where the L2 cache had to store a duplicate of the data stored in the L1 cache. As a comparison the inclusive design of the Celeron effectively reduced the available size of the Level 2 cache by the size of the Level 1, which resulted in an effective size of 96 KB (128-32) in contrast to the Duron's exclusive design (128+64=192). Consequently, the Duron inherited the Thunderbird's reduction in sensitivity to L2 cache size, allowing AMD to make their L2 cache higher latency and lower bandwidth to lessen processor complexity and allow better manufacturing yields without incurring a significant performance loss. The net result was that the budget Duron \\"Spitfire\\" CPU was roughly only 10% slower than an equivalently clocked (and significantly more expensive) Athlon \\"Thunderbird\\". Compatibility The Duron line was pin-compatible and operated on the same motherboards as the Athlon line, requiring only a BIOS update in most cases. The original Duron was introduced with a 100 MHz (effectively 200 MHz) front-side bus - the same as the then current Socket A Athlons. Later with the introduction of motherboard chipsets offering higher FSB speeds of 133 MHz (FSB 266) and AMD's matching introduction of Athlon \\"C\\" processors supporting this speed, the Duron initially retained the 100 MHz FSB for purposes of market segmentation. Later Durons were given official support for 133 MHz bus operation only after the Athlon XP was used to introduce 166/200 MHz FSB (FSB 333/400) speeds. Revisions The original Duron, using the \\"Spitfire\\" core, was manufactured in 2000 and 2001 at speeds ranging from 600 to 950 MHz. It was based on the 180 nm \\"Thunderbird\\" Athlon core. The second-generation Duron, the \\"Morgan\\" core, was sold in speed grades between 900 and 1300 MHz, and was based on the 180 nm \\"Palomino\\" Athlon XP core. As a result, it featured a few important enhancements, namely full Intel SSE support, enlarged TLBs, hardware data prefetch, and an integrated thermal diode. Like the \\"Palomino\\" core, \\"Morgan\\" was also expected to reduce heat dissipation; however in \\"Morgan\\"'s case this did not happen due to its increased core voltage. The final generation Duron was called \\"Applebred\\", sometimes called \\"Appalbred\\", and was based on the \\"Appaloosa\\" Duron along with the 130 nm \\"Thoroughbred\\" Athlon XP. \\"Appaloosa\\" was never officially announced but it did see very limited circulation. Enthusiasts Duron was often a favorite of computer builders looking for performance while on a tight budget. In 2003, the \\"Applebred\\" Duron was available in 1.4 GHz, 1.6 GHz and 1.8 GHz forms, all on a 133 MHz (FSB 266) bus by default. Enthusiast groups quickly discovered these Durons to be rebadged \\"Thoroughbred\\" A/B cores with some cache disabled (and perhaps defective). With a basic chip configuration modification, it was found that \\"Applebred\\" Durons could be turned into \\"Thoroughbred B\\" Athlon XPs, with full 256KB cache, with a very high success rate. However, this was only possible for a period of approximately 4 weeks, as shortly after \\"Applebred\\" was released, AMD changed the chip configuration method to one that was not changeable.

Lampson, ForMemRS, (born December 23, 1943) is an American computer scientist best known for his contributions to the development and implementation of distributed personal computing. Education and early life After graduating from the Lawrenceville School (where in 2009 he was awarded the Aldo Leopold Award, also known as the Lawrenceville Medal, Lawrenceville's highest award to alumni), Lampson received an A.B. in physics (magna cum laude with highest honors in the discipline) from Harvard University in 1964 and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967. Career and research Professional Developers Conference 2009 Technical Leaders Panel During the 1960s, Lampson and others were part of Project GENIE at UC Berkeley. In 1965, several Project GENIE members, specifically Lampson and Peter Deutsch, developed the Berkeley Timesharing System for Scientific Data Systems' SDS 940 computer. After completing his doctorate, Lampson stayed on at UC Berkeley as an assistant professor (1967-1970) and associate professor (1970-1971) of computer science. For a period of time, he concurrently served as director of system development for the Berkeley Computer Corporation (1969-1971). In 1971, Lampson became one of the founding members of Xerox PARC, where he worked in the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) as a principal scientist (1971-1975) and senior research fellow (1975-1983). His now-famous vision of a personal computer was captured in the 1972 memo entitled \\"Why Alto?\\".DigiBarn Computer Museum: Why Alto? Butler Lampson's Historic 1972 Memo In 1973, the Xerox Alto, with its three- button mouse and full-page-sized monitor, was born. It is now considered to be the first actual personal computer in terms of what has become the \\"canonical\\" GUI mode of operation. All the subsequent computers built at Xerox PARC except for the \\"Dolphin\\" (used in the Xerox 1100 LISP machine) and the \\"Dorado\\" (used in the Xerox 1132 LISP machine) followed a general blueprint called \\"Wildflower\\", written by Lampson, and this included the D-Series Machines: the \\"Dandelion\\" (used in the Xerox Star and Xerox 1108 LISP machine), \\"Dandetiger\\" (used in the Xerox 1109 LISP machine), , \\"Daybreak\\" (Xerox 6085), and \\"Dicentra\\" (used internally to control various specialized hardware devices). At PARC, Lampson helped work on many other revolutionary technologies, such as laser printer design; two-phase commit protocols; Bravo, the first WYSIWYG text formatting program; and Ethernet, the first high-speed local area network (LAN). He designed several influential programming languages such as Euclid. Following the acrimonious resignation of Xerox PARC CSL manager Bob Taylor in 1983, Lampson and Chuck Thacker followed their longtime colleague to Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center. There, he was a senior consulting engineer (1984-1986), corporate consulting engineer (1986-1993) and senior corporate consulting engineer (1993-1995). Shortly before Taylor's retirement, Lampson left to work for Microsoft Research as an architect (1995-1999), distinguished engineer (2000-2005) and technical fellow (2005‚Äìpresent). Since 1987, Lampson has been an adjunct professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. =Honors and awards= * In 1984, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. * In 1984, he won the ACM Software System Award for the Alto, along with Robert W. Taylor, and Charles P. Thacker. * In 1986, he received an honorary Sc.D. from the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule, Z√ºrich. * In 1992, he won the prestigious ACM Turing Award for his contributions to personal computing and computer science. * In 1993, he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. * In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM. * In 1996, he received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award. * In 1996, he received an honorary Sc.D. from the University of Bologna. * In 2001, he received the IEEE John von Neumann Medal. * In 2004, he won the Charles Stark Draper Prize along with Alan C.

Real-time strategy games allow for all players to simultaneously play the game in \\"real-time\\". This is contrasted by turn-based strategy (TBS) games, where players must take turns to play. The term \\"real-time strategy\\" was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s. In a real-time strategy game, the participants position structures and maneuver units under their control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents' assets. In a typical RTS game, it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game. This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources. These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose. More specifically, the typical game in the RTS genre features: resource-gathering, base-building, in-game technological development, and indirect control of units. The tasks a player must perform to succeed at an RTS can be very demanding, so complex user interfaces have evolved to cope with the challenge. Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments; for example, the technique of \\"clicking and dragging\\" to create a box that selects all units under a given area. Though some video game genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template, recognized genres are generally not subsumed as RTS games. For instance, city-building games, construction and management simulations, and games of the real-time tactics variety are generally not considered to be real-time strategy per se. History =Origins= The genre that is recognized today as \\"real-time strategy\\" emerged as a result of an extended period of evolution and refinement. Games that are today sometimes perceived as ancestors of the real- time strategy genre were never marketed or designed as such at the original date of publication. As a result, designating \\"early real-time strategy\\" titles is problematic because such games are being held up to modern standards. The genre initially evolved separately in the United Kingdom, Japan, and North America, afterward gradually merging into a unified worldwide tradition. Tim Barry in May 1981 described in InfoWorld a multiplayer, real- time strategy space game that ran (\\"and probably still is\\") on an IBM System/370 Model 168 at a large San Francisco Bay area company. He stated that it had \\"far better support than many of the application programs used in the business\\", with a published manual and regular schedule. Comparing its complexity to Dallas, Barry recalled that \\"when the game was restored at 5 P.M., a lot of regular work stopped\\". Ars Technica traces the genre's roots back to Utopia (1981), citing it as the \\"birth of a genre\\", with a \\"real-time element\\" that was \\"virtually unheard of\\", thus making it \\"arguably the earliest ancestor of the real-time strategy genre\\". According to Ars Technica, Utopia was a turn-based strategy game with hybrid elements that ran \\"in real- time but events happened on a regular turn-based cycle.\\" According to Brett Weiss, Utopia is often cited as \\"the first real-time strategy game.\\" According to Matt Barton and Bill Loguidice, Utopia \\"helped set the template\\" for the genre, but has \\"more in common with SimCity than it does with Dune II and later RTS games.\\" Allgame listed War of Nerves as the oldest \\"2D Real-Time Strategy\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20141114203712/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=17383 Barton also cites Cytron Masters (1982), saying it was \\"one of the first (if not the first) real-time strategy games.\\" On the other hand, Scott Sharkey of 1UP argues that, while Cytron Masters \\"attempted real time strategy\\", it was \\"much more tactical than strategic\\" due to \\"the inability to construct units or manage resources\\". BYTE in December 1982 published as an Apple II type-in program Cosmic Conquest. The winner of the magazine's annual Game Contest, the author described it as a \\"single-player game of real-time action and strategic decision making\\". The magazine described it as \\"a real-time space strategy game\\". The game has elements of resource management and wargaming. In the United Kingdom, the earliest real-time strategy games are Stonkers by John Gibson, published in 1983 by Imagine Software for the ZX Spectrum, and Nether Earth for ZX Spectrum in 1987. In North America, the oldest game retrospectively classified as real-time strategy by several sources is The Ancient Art of War (1984), designed by Evryware's Dave and Barry Murry, followed by The Ancient Art of War at Sea in 1987. In Japan, the earliest is Bokosuka Wars (1983), an early strategy RPG (or \\"simulation RPG\\");Bokosuka Wars (translation), Nintendo the game revolves around the player leading an army across a battlefield against enemy forces in real-time while recruiting/spawning soldiers along the way, for which it is considered by Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com to be an early prototype real-time strategy game.Dru Hill: The Chronicle of Druaga , 1UP Another early title with real-time strategy elements is Sega's Gain Ground (1988), a strategy-action game that involved directing a set of troops across various enemy-filled levels.Sega Ages: Gain Ground, IGN, July 20, 2004Top 10 Renovation Games, IGN, June 17, 2008 TechnoSoft's Herzog (1988) is regarded as a precursor to the real-time strategy genre, being the predecessor to Herzog Zwei and somewhat similar in nature, though primitive in comparison.Herzog Zwei, GameSpy IGN cites Herzog Zwei, released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis home console in 1989 as \\"arguably the first RTS game ever\\", and it is often cited as \\"the first real- time strategy game\\" according to Ars Technica. It combines traditional strategy gameplay with fully real-time, fast-paced, arcade-style action gameplay, featuring a split-screen two-player mode where both players are in action simultaneously and there are no pauses while decisions are taken, forcing players to think quickly while on the move. In Herzog Zwei, though the player only controls one unit, the manner of control foreshadowed the point- and-click mechanic of later games. Scott Sharkey of 1UP argues that it introduced much of the genre conventions, including unit construction and resource management, with the control and destruction of bases being an important aspect of the game, as were the economic/production aspects of those bases. Herzog Zwei is credited by 1UP as a landmark that defined the genre and as \\"the progenitor of all modern real-time strategy games.\\" Chuck Sperry cited Herzog Zwei as an influence on Dune II. Notable as well are early games like Mega Lo Mania by Sensible Software (1991) and Supremacy (also called Overlord ‚Äì 1990). Although these two lacked direct control of military units, they both offered considerable control of resource management and economic systems. In addition, Mega Lo Mania has advanced technology trees that determine offensive and defensive prowess. Another early (1988) game, Carrier Command by Realtime Games, involved real-time responses to events in the game, requiring management of resources and control of vehicles. The early game Sim Ant by Maxis (1991) had resource gathering, and controlling an attacking army by having them follow a lead unit. However, it was with the release of Dune II from Westwood Studios (1992) that real-time strategy became recognized as a distinct genre of video games. =1992‚Äì1998: seminal titles= Although real- time strategy games have an extensive history, some titles have served to define the popular perception of the genre and expectations of real-time strategy titles more than others, in particular the games released between 1992 and 1998 by Westwood Studios and Blizzard Entertainment. Drawing influence from Herzog Zwei, Populous, Eye of the Beholder, and the Macintosh user interface, Westwood's Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty (1992) featured all the core concepts and mechanics of modern real-time strategy games that are still used today, such as using the mouse to move units, and gathering resources, and as such served as the prototype for later real-time strategy games. According to its co-designer and lead programmer, Joe Bostic, a \\"benefit over Herzog Zwei is that we had the advantage of a mouse and keyboard. This greatly facilitated precise player control, which enabled the player to give orders to individual units. The mouse, and the direct control it allowed, was critical in making the RTS genre possible.‚Äù The success of Dune II encouraged several games which became influential in their own right. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (1994) achieved great prominence upon its release, owing in part to its use of a fantasy setting and also to its depiction of a wide variety of buildings (such as farms) which approximated a full fictitious society, not just a military force. Command & Conquer, as well as Command and Conquer: Red Alert, became the most popular early RTS games. These two games contended with Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness after its release in late 1995. Total Annihilation, released by Cavedog Entertainment in 1997, introduced 3D units and terrain and focused on huge battles that emphasized macromanagement over micromanagement. It featured a streamlined interface that would influence many RTS games in later years. Age of Empires, released by Ensemble Studios in 1997 tried to put a game in a slower pace, combining elements of Civilization with the real-time strategy concept by introducing ages of technologies. In 1998, Blizzard released the game StarCraft, which became an international phenomenon and is still played in large professional leagues to this day. Collectively, all of these games defined the genre, providing the de facto benchmark against which new real-time strategy games are measured. =Refinement and transition to 3D= The real-time strategy genre has been relatively stable since 1995. Additions to the genre's concept in newer games tend to emphasize more of the basic RTS elements (higher unit caps, more unit types, larger maps, etc.). Rather than innovations to the game concept, new games generally focus on refining aspects of successful predecessors. As the paragon example of gameplay refinement, Cavedog's acclaimed Total Annihilation from 1997 distilled the core mechanics of Command & Conquer, and introduced the first 3D units and terrain in real-time strategy games. The Age of Empires focus on historical setting and age advancement was refined further by its sequel, Age of Empires II: Age of Kings, and by Stainless Steel Studios' Empire Earth in 2001. GSC Game World's Cossacks: European Wars series took the genre in a different direction, bringing population caps into the tens of thousands. Dungeon Keeper (1997), Populous: The Beginning (1998), Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds (1998), Warzone 2100 (1999), Machines (1999), Homeworld (1999), Honour & Freedom (1999), and Dark Reign 2 (2000) were among the first completely 3D real-time strategy titles. Homeworld was notable in that it featured a 3D environment in space, therefore allowing movement in every direction, a feature which its semi-sequel, Homeworld Cataclysm (2000) continued to build upon adding features such as waypoints. Homeworld 2, released in 2003, streamlined movement in the 360¬∞ 3D environment. Furthermore, Machines, which was also released in 1999 and featured a nearly 100% 3D environment, attempted to combine the RTS genre with a first-person shooter (FPS) genre although it was not a particularly successful title. These games were followed by a short period of interest in experimental strategy games such as Allegiance (2000). Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds was notable for being one of the few completely non-linear RTS games ever. It is only in approximately 2002 that 3D real-time strategy became the standard, with both Warcraft III (2002) and Ensemble Studio's Age of Mythology (2002) being built on a full 3D game engine. Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns introduced classic wargame elements, such as supply lines to the genre. Battle Realms (2001) was another full 3D game, but had limited camera views. The move from 2D to 3D has been criticized in some cases. Issues with controlling the camera and placement of objects have been cited as problems. =Specialization and evolution= A few games have experimented with diversifying map design, which continues to be largely two-dimensional even in 3D engines. Earth 2150 (2000) allowed units to tunnel underground, effectively creating a dual-layer map; three-layer (orbit-surface-underground) maps were introduced in Metal Fatigue. In addition, units could even be transported to entirely separate maps, with each map having its own window in the user interface. Three Kingdoms: Fate of the Dragon (2001) offered a simpler model: the main map contains locations that expand into their own maps. In these examples, however, the gameplay was essentially identical regardless of the map layer in question. Dragonshard (2005) emphasized its dual-layer maps by placing one of the game's two main resources in each map, making exploration and control of both maps fundamentally valuable. Relatively few genres have emerged from or in competition with real-time strategy games, although real-time tactics (RTT), a superficially similar genre, emerged around 1995. In 1998, Activision attempted to combine the real-time strategy and first-person shooter genres in Battlezone (1998), while in 2002 Rage Games Limited attempted this with the Hostile Waters games. Later variants have included Natural Selection (2002), a game modification based on the Half-Life engine, and the free software Tremulous/Unvanquished. Savage: The Battle for Newerth (2003) combined the RPG and RTS elements in an online game. Some games, borrowing from the real-time tactics (RTT) template, have moved toward an increased focus on tactics while downplaying traditional resource management, in which designated units collect the resources used for producing further units or buildings. Titles like Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War (2004), Star Wars: Empire at War (2006), and Company of Heroes (2006) replace the traditional resource gathering model with a strategic control-point system, in which control over strategic points yields construction/reinforcement points. Ground Control (2000) was the first such game to replace individual units with \\"squads\\". Others are moving away from the traditional real-time strategy game model with the addition of other genre elements. One example is Sins of a Solar Empire (2008), released by Ironclad Games, which mixes elements of grand-scale stellar empire building games like Master of Orion with real-time strategy elements. Another example is indie game Achron (2011), which incorporates time travel as a game mechanic, allowing a player to send units forward or backward in time. Multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBA) have originated as a subgenre of real-time strategy games, however this fusion of real-time strategy, role- playing, and action games has lost many traditional RTS elements. These type of games moved away from constructing additional structures, base management, army building, and controlling additional units. Map and the main structures for each team are still present, and destroying enemy main structure will secure victory as the ultimate victory condition. Unlike in RTS, a player has control over the only one single powerful unit, called \\"hero\\" or \\"champion\\", who advances in level, learns new abilities, and grows in power over the course of a match. Players can find various friendly and enemy units on the map at any given time assisting each team, however, these units are computer- controlled and players usually don't have direct control over their movement and creation; instead, they march forward along set paths. Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a Warcraft III mod from 2003, and its standalone sequel Dota 2 (2013), as well as League of Legends (2009), and Heroes of the Storm (2015), are the typical representatives of the new strategy subgenre. Former game journalist Luke Smith called DotA \\"the ultimate RTS\\". Gameplay 0 A.D., showing typical RTS interface elements such as a resource overview (top left), a map of the game world (bottom left), and a description of the selected unit (bottom center) In a typical real-time strategy game, the screen is divided into a map area displaying the game world and terrain, units, and buildings, and an interface overlay containing command and production controls and often a \\"radar\\" or \\"minimap\\" overview of the entire map.Starcraft in-game image Command & Conquer in-game image The player is usually given an isometric perspective of the world, or a free-roaming camera from an aerial viewpoint for modern 3D games. Players mainly scroll the screen and issue commands with the mouse, and may also use keyboard shortcuts. Gameplay generally consists of the player being positioned somewhere in the map with a few units or a building that is capable of building other units/buildings. Often, but not always, the player must build specific structures to unlock more advanced units in the tech tree. Often, but not always, RTS games require the player to build an army (ranging from small squads of no more than 2 units, to literally hundreds of units) and using them to either defend themselves from a virtual form of Human wave attack or to eliminate enemies who possess bases with unit production capacities of their own. Occasionally, RTS games will have a preset number of units for the player to control and do not allow building of additional ones. Resource gathering is commonly the main focus of the RTS games, but other titles of the genre place higher gameplay significance to how units are used in combat (Z: Steel Soldiers for example, awards credits for territory captured rather than gathered resources), the extreme example of which are games of the real-time tactical genre. Some titles impose a ceiling on the number simultaneous troops, which becomes a key gameplay consideration, a significant example being StarCraft, while other titles have no such unit cap. =Micromanagement and macromanagement= Micromanagement deals with a player's constant need to manage and maintain individual units and resources on a fine scale. On the other hand, macromanagement refers to a player's management of economic expansion and large-scale strategic maneuvering, allowing the player time to think and consider possible solutions. Micromanagement involves the use of combat tactics involved in the present, whereas macromanagement considers the greater scale of the game in an attempt to predict the future. =Criticism of gameplay= Because of their generally faster-paced nature (and in some cases a smaller learning curve), real-time strategy games have surpassed the popularity of turn-based strategy computer games. In the past, a common criticism was to regard real-time strategy games as \\"cheap imitations\\" of turn-based strategy games, arguing that real-time strategy games had a tendency to devolve into \\"click-fests\\" in which the player who was faster with the mouse generally won, because they could give orders to their units at a faster rate. The common retort is that success involves not just fast clicking, but also the ability to make sound decisions under time pressure. The \\"clickfest\\" argument is also often voiced alongside a \\"button babysitting\\" criticism, which pointed out that a great deal of game time is spent either waiting and watching for the next time a production button could be clicked, or rapidly alternating between different units and buildings, clicking their respective button.This mostly a concern with older RTS games that did not feature building queues, meaning that players would have to click the button to build a unit soon after it was completed. However, in some games where units have timed abilities that must be explicitly activated, for instance heroes in the real-time tactics game Mark of Chaos this is still a concern. A third common criticism is that real-time gameplay often degenerates into \\"rushes\\" where the players try to gain the advantage and subsequently defeat the opponent as quickly in the game as possible, preferably before the opposition is capable of successfully reacting. For example, the original Command & Conquer gave birth to the now-common \\"tank rush\\" tactic, where the game outcome is often decided very early on by one player gaining an initial advantage in resources and producing large amounts of a relatively powerful but still quite cheap unit‚Äîwhich is thrown at the opposition before they have had time to establish defenses or production. Although this strategy has been criticized for encouraging overwhelming force over strategy and tactics, defenders of the strategy argue that they're simply taking advantage of the strategies utilized, and some argue that it is a realistic representation of warfare. One of the most infamous versions of a rush is the \\"Zergling rush\\" from the real-time strategy game StarCraft, where the Zerg player would morph one of their starting workers (or the first one produced) into a spawning pool immediately and use all of their resources to produce Zerglings, attacking once they have enough to overwhelm any early defense; in fact, the term \\"zerging\\" has become synonymous with rushing. A fourth criticism of the RTS genre is the importance of skill over strategy in real-time strategy games. The manual dexterity and ability to multitask and divide one's attention is often considered the most important aspect to succeeding at the RTS genre. According to Troy Dunniway, former Westwood developer who has also worked on Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, \\"A player controls hundreds of units, dozens of buildings and many different events that are all happening simultaneously. There is only one player, and he can only pay attention to one thing at a time. Expert players can quickly flip between many different tasks, while casual gamers have more problems with this.\\" Tactics vs. strategy Real-time strategy games have been criticized for an overabundance of tactical considerations when compared to the amount of strategic gameplay found in such games. According to Chris Taylor, lead designer of Supreme Commander, he said, \\"[My first attempt at visualizing RTSs in a fresh and interesting new way] was my realizing that although we call this genre 'Real-Time Strategy,' it should have been called 'Real-Time Tactics' with a dash of strategy thrown in.\\" (Taylor then posits his own game as having surpassed this mold by including additional elements of broader strategic scope.) In general terms, military strategy refers to the use of a broad arsenal of weapons including diplomatic, informational, military, and economic resources, whereas military tactics is more concerned with short-term goals such as winning an individual battle. In the context of strategy video games, however, the difference is often reduced to the more limited criteria of either a presence or absence of base building and unit production. In an article for Gamasutra, Nathan Toronto criticizes real-time strategy games for too often having only one valid means of victory ‚Äî attrition ‚Äî comparing them unfavorably to real-time tactics games. Players' awareness that the only way for them to win or lose is militarily makes them unlikely to respond to gestures of diplomacy. The result is that the winner of a real-time strategy game is too often the best tactician rather than the best strategist. Troy Goodfellow counters this by saying that the problem is not that real-time strategy games are lacking in strategy (he says attrition is a form of strategy), rather it is that they too often have the same strategy: produce faster than you consume. He also states that building and managing armies is the conventional definition of real-time strategy, and that it is unfair to make comparisons with other genres. In an article for GameSpy, Mark Walker criticizes real-time strategy games for their lack of combat tactics, suggesting real-time tactics games as a more suitable substitute. He also says that developers need to begin looking outside the genre for new ideas in order for strategy games to continue to be successful in the future. Turn-based vs. real-time A debate has emerged between fans of real-time strategy (RTS) and turn-based strategy (TBS) (and related genres) based on the merits of the real-time and turn-based systems. Some titles attempt to merge the two systems: for example, the role-playing game Fallout uses turn-based combat and real-time gameplay, while the real-time strategy games Homeworld, Rise of Nations, and the games of the Total War series allow the player to pause the game and issue orders. Additionally, the Total War series has a combination of a turn-based strategy map with a real-time battle map. Another example of a game combining both turn-based game and real-time-strategy is The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth II which allows players, in a 'War of the Ring' game, to play a turn-based strategy game, but also battle each other in real time. On consoles Despite Herzog Zwei, a console game, laying the foundations for the real-time strategy genre, RTS games never gained popularity on consoles like they did on the PC platform. Real-time strategy games made for video game consoles have been consistently criticized due to their control schemes, as the PC's keyboard and mouse are considered to be superior to a console's gamepad for the genre. Thus, RTS games for home consoles have been met with mixed success. Scott Sharkey of 1UP notes that Herzog Zwei had already \\"offered a nearly perfect solution to the problem by giving the player direct control of a single powerful unit and near autonomy for everything else,\\" and is surprised \\"that more console RTS games aren't designed with this kind of interface in mind from the ground up, rather than imitating\\" PC control schemes \\"that just doesn't work very well with a controller\\". Some handheld consoles like Napoleon on the GBA uses a similar solution. However, Halo Wars, which was released in 2009 for the Xbox 360, generated generally positive reviews, achieved an 82% critic average on aggregate web sites, and sold over 1 million copies. According to IGN, the gameplay lacks the traditional RTS concepts of limited resources and resource gathering and lacks multiple buildings. Graphics Total Annihilation (1997) was the first real-time strategy game to utilize true 3D units, terrain, and physics in both rendering and in gameplay. For instance, the missiles in Total Annihilation travel in real time in simulated 3D space, and they can miss their target by passing over or under it. Similarly, missile-armed units in Earth 2150 are at a serious disadvantage when the opponent is on high ground because the missiles often hit the cliffside, even in the case when the attacker is a missile-armed helicopter. Homeworld, Warzone 2100 and Machines (all released in 1999) advanced the use of fully 3D environments in real-time strategy titles. In the case of Homeworld, the game is set in space, offering a uniquely exploitable 3D environment in which all units can move vertically in addition to the horizontal plane. However, the near-industry-wide switch to full 3D was very gradual and most real-time strategy titles, including the first sequels to Command & Conquer, initially used isometric 3D graphics made by pre-rendered 3D tiles. Only in later years did these games begin to use true 3D graphics and gameplay, making it possible to rotate the view of the battlefield in real-time. Spring is a good example of the transformation from semi-3D to full-3D game simulations. It is an open-source project which aims to give a Total Annihilation game-play experience in three dimensions. The most ambitious use of full 3D graphics was realized in Supreme Commander, where all projectiles, units and terrain were simulated in real time, taking full advantage of the UI's zoom feature, which allowed cartographic style navigation of the 3D environment. This led to a number of unique gameplay elements, which were mostly obscured by the lack of computing power available in 2007, at the release date. Japanese game developers Nippon Ichi and Vanillaware worked together on Grim Grimoire, a PlayStation 2 title released in 2007, which features hand-drawn animated 2D graphics. From 2010, real-time strategy games more commonly incorporated physics engines, such as Havok, in order to increase realism experienced in gameplay. A modern real-time strategy game that uses a physics engine is Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires III, released on October 18, 2005, which used the Havok Game Dynamics SDK to power its real-time physics. Company of Heroes is another real-time strategy game that uses realistically modeled physics as a part of gameplay, including fully destructible environments. Tournaments RTS World tournaments have been held for both StarCraft and Warcraft III since their 1998 and 2002 releases. The games have been so successful that some players have earned over $200,000 at the Warcraft III World Championships. In addition, hundreds of StarCraft II tournaments are held yearly, as it is becoming an increasingly popular branch of e-sports. Notable tournaments include MLG, GSL, and Dreamhack. RTS tournaments are especially popular in South Korea.

Alto: A personal computer. Xerox, Palo Alto Research Center, 1979. The first machines were introduced on 1 March 1973, a decade before mass-market GUI machines became available. The Alto is contained in a relatively small cabinet and uses a custom central processing unit (CPU) built from multiple SSI and MSI integrated circuits. Each machine cost tens of thousands of dollars despite its status as a personal computer. Only small numbers were built initially, but by the late 1970s, about 1,000 were in use at various Xerox laboratories, and about another 500 in several universities. Total production was about 2,000 systems. The Alto became well known in Silicon Valley and its GUI was increasingly seen as the future of computing. In 1979, Steve Jobs arranged a visit to Xerox PARC, during which Apple Computer personnel would receive demonstrations of Xerox technology in exchange for Xerox being able to purchase stock options in Apple. After two visits to see the Alto, Apple engineers used the concepts to introduce the Apple Lisa and Macintosh systems. Xerox eventually commercialized a heavily modified version of the Alto concepts as the Xerox Star, first introduced in 1981. A complete office system including several workstations, storage and a laser printer cost as much as $100,000, and like the Alto, the Star had little direct impact on the market. History Alto mouse. Alto ball-type mouse underside. Alto keyset. The Alto was conceived in 1972 in a memo written by Butler Lampson, inspired by the oN-Line System (NLS) developed by Douglas Engelbart and Dustin Lindberg at SRI International (SRI). It was designed mostly by Charles P. Thacker. Industrial Design and manufacturing was sub- contracted to Xerox, whose Special Programs Group team included Doug Stewart as Program Manager, Abbey Silverstone Operations, Bob Nishimura, Industrial Designer. An initial run of 30 units was produced by Xerox El Segundo (Special Programs Group), working with John Ellenby at PARC and Doug Stewart and Abbey Silverstone at El Segundo, who were responsible for re-designing the Alto's electronics. Due to the success of the pilot run, the team went on to produce approximately 2,000 units over the next ten years.\\"The History of the Xerox Alto\\". Carl J. Clement. March, 2002. Several Xerox Alto chassis are now on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, one is on display at the Computer Museum of America in Roswell, Georgia, and several are in private hands. Running systems are on display at the Living Computer Museum in Seattle, Washington. Charles P. Thacker was awarded the 2009 Turing Award of the Association for Computing Machinery on March 9, 2010 for his pioneering design and realization of the Alto. The 2004 Charles Stark Draper Prize was awarded to Thacker, Alan C. Kay, Butler Lampson, and Robert W. Taylor for their work on Alto.\\"2004 Recipients of the Charles Stark Draper Prize\\" On October 21, 2014, Xerox Alto's source code and other resources were released from the Computer History Museum. Architecture The following description is based mostly on the August 1976 Alto Hardware Manual by Xerox PARC. Alto uses a microcoded design, but unlike many computers, the microcode engine is not hidden from the programmer in a layered design. Applications such as Pinball take advantage of this to accelerate performance. The Alto has a bit- slice arithmetic logic unit (ALU) based on the Texas Instruments 74181 chip, a ROM control store with a writable control store extension and has 128 (expandable to 512) kB of main memory organized in 16-bit words. Mass storage is provided by a hard disk drive that uses a removable 2.5 MB one-platter cartridge (Diablo Systems, a company Xerox later bought) similar to those used by the IBM 2310. The base machine and one disk drive are housed in a cabinet about the size of a small refrigerator; one more disk drive can be added via daisy-chaining. Alto both blurred and ignored the lines between functional elements. Rather than a distinct central processing unit with a well-defined electrical interface (e.g., system bus) to storage and peripherals, the Alto ALU interacts directly with hardware interfaces to memory and peripherals, driven by microinstructions that are output from the control store. The microcode machine supports up to 16 cooperative tasks, each with fixed priority. The emulator task executes the normal instruction set to which most applications are written; that instruction set is similar to, but not the same as, that of a Data General Nova. Other tasks serve the display, memory refresh, disk, network, and other I/O functions. As an example, the bitmap display controller is little more than a 16-bit shift register; microcode moves display refresh data from main memory to the shift register, which serializes it into a display of pixels corresponding to the ones and zeros of the memory data. Ethernet is likewise supported by minimal hardware, with a shift register that acts bidirectionally to serialize output words and deserialize input words. Its speed was designed to be 3 Mbit/s because the microcode engine could not go faster and continue to support the video display, disk activity and memory refresh. Unlike most minicomputers of the era, Alto does not support a serial terminal for user interface. Apart from an Ethernet connection, the Alto's only common output device is a bi-level (black and white) cathode ray tube (CRT) display with a tilt-and-swivel base, mounted in portrait orientation rather than the more common \\"landscape\\" orientation. Its input devices are a custom detachable keyboard, a three-button mouse, and an optional 5-key chorded keyboard (chord keyset). The last two items had been introduced by SRI's On-Line System; while the mouse was an instant success among Alto users, the chord keyset never became popular. In the early mice, the buttons were three narrow bars, arranged top to bottom rather than side to side; they were named after their colors in the documentation. The motion was sensed by two wheels perpendicular to each other. These were soon replaced with a ball-type mouse, which was invented by Ronald E. Rider and developed by Bill English. These were photo-mechanical mice, first using white light, and then infrared (IR), to count the rotations of wheels inside the mouse. The keyboard is interesting in that each key is represented as a separate bit in a set of memory locations. As a result, it is possible to read multiple key presses concurrently. This trait can be used to alter from where on the disk the Alto boots. The keyboard value is used as the sector address on the disk to boot from, and by holding specific keys down while pressing the boot button, different microcode and operating systems can be loaded. This gave rise to the expression \\"nose boot\\" where the keys needed to boot for a test OS release required more fingers than you could come up with. Nose boots were made obsolete by the move2keys program that shifted files on the disk so that a specified key sequence could be used. Several other I/O devices were developed for the Alto, including a TV camera, the Hy-Type daisywheel printer and a parallel port, although these were quite rare. The Alto could also control external disk drives to act as a file server. This was a common application for the machine. Software The Alto Neptune file manager program Smalltalk-76 aka interim Alan Kay's Dynabook OS Early software for the Alto was written in the programming language BCPL, and later in Mesa, which was not widely used outside PARC but influenced several later languages, such as Modula. The Alto used an early version of ASCII which lacked the underscore character, instead having the left-arrow character used in ALGOL 60 and many derivatives for the assignment operator: this peculiarity may have been the source of the CamelCase style for compound identifiers. Altos were also microcode-programmable by users. The Alto helped popularize the use of raster graphics model for all output, including text and graphics. It also introduced the concept of the bit block transfer operation (bit blit, BitBLT), as the fundamental programming interface to the display. Despite its small memory size, many innovative programs were written for the Alto, including: * the first WYSIWYG document preparation systems, Bravo and Gypsy; * the Laurel email tool, and its successor, Hardy * the Sil vector graphics editor, used mainly for logic circuits, printed circuit board, and other technical diagrams; * the Markup bitmap editor (an early paint program); * the Draw graphical editor using lines & splines; * the first WYSIWYG integrated circuit editor based on the work of Lynn Conway, Carver Mead, and the Mead & Conway revolution; * the first versions of the Smalltalk environment * Interlisp * one of the first network-based multi-person video games (Alto Trek by Gene Ball). There was no spreadsheet or database software. The first electronic spreadsheet program, VisiCalc, did not arise until 1979. Diffusion and evolution Technically, the Alto was a small minicomputer, but it could be considered a personal computer in the sense that it was used by one person sitting at a desk, in contrast with the mainframe computers and other minicomputers of the era. It was arguably \\"the first personal computer\\", although this title is disputed by others. More significantly (and perhaps less controversially), it may be considered to be one of the first workstation systems in the style of single-user machines such as the Apollo, based on the Unix operating system, and systems by Symbolics, designed to natively run Lisp as a development environment. In 1976 to 1977 the Swiss computer pioneer Niklaus Wirth spent a sabbatical at PARC and was excited by the Alto. Unable to bring back one of the Alto systems to Europe, Wirth decided to build a new system from scratch and he designed with his group the Lilith. Lilith was ready to use around 1980, quite some time before Apple Lisa and Apple Macintosh were released. Around 1985 Wirth started a complete redesign of the Lilith under the Name \\"Project Oberon\\". In 1978 Xerox donated 50 Altos to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Rochester. The National Bureau of Standards's Institute for Computer Sciences in Gaithersburg, Maryland received one Alto in late 1978 along with Xerox Interim File System (IFS) file servers and Dover laser printers. These machines were the inspiration for the ETH Z√ºrich Lilith and Three Rivers Company PERQ workstations, and the Stanford University Network (SUN) workstation, which was eventually marketed by a spin- off company, Sun Microsystems. The Apollo/Domain workstation was heavily influenced by the Alto. Following the acquisition of an Alto, the White House information systems department sought to lead federal computer suppliers in its direction. The Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP) issued a request for proposal for a computer system to replace the aging Office of Management and Budget (OMB) budget system, using Alto-like workstations, connected to an IBM-compatible mainframe. The request was eventually withdrawn because no mainframe producer could supply such a configuration. In December 1979, Apple Computer's co-founder Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC, where he was shown the Smalltalk-80 object-oriented programming environment, networking, and most importantly the WYSIWYG, mouse- driven graphical user interface provided by the Alto. At the time, he didn't recognize the significance of the first two, but was excited by the last one, promptly integrating it into Apple's products; first into the Lisa and then in the Macintosh, attracting several key researchers to work in his company. In 1980‚Äì1981, Xerox Altos were used by engineers at PARC and at the Xerox System Development Department to design the Xerox Star workstations. Xerox and the Alto Xerox was slow to realize the value of the technology that had been developed at PARC. The Xerox corporate acquisition of Scientific Data Systems (SDS, later XDS) in the late 1960s had no interest with PARC. PARC built their own emulation of the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 named the MAXC. The MAXC was PARC's gateway machine to the ARPANET. The firm was reluctant to get into the computer business again with commercially untested designs, although many of the philosophies would ship in later products. Byte magazine stated in 1981, After the Alto, PARC developed more powerful workstations (none intended as projects) informally termed \\"the D-machines\\": Dandelion (least powerful, but the only to be made a product in one form), Dolphin; Dorado (most powerful; an emitter-coupled logic (ECL) machine); and hybrids like the Dandel-Iris. Before the advent of personal computers such as the Apple II in 1977 and the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in 1981, the computer market was dominated by costly mainframes and minicomputers equipped with dumb terminals that time-shared the processing time of the central computer. Through the 1970s, Xerox showed no interest in the work done at PARC. When Xerox finally entered the PC market with the Xerox 820, they pointedly rejected the Alto design and opted instead for a very conventional model, a CP/M-based machine with the then-standard 80 by 24 character-only monitor and no mouse. With the help of PARC researchers, Xerox eventually developed the Xerox Star, based on the Dandelion workstation, and later the cost reduced Star, the 6085 office system, based on the Daybreak workstation. These machines, based on the 'Wildflower' architecture described in a paper by Butler Lampson, incorporated most of the Alto innovations, including the graphical user interface with icons, windows, folders, Ethernet-based local networking, and network-based laser printer services. Xerox only realized their mistake in the early 1980s, after Apple's Macintosh revolutionized the PC market via its bitmap display and the mouse-centered interface. Both of these were copied from the Alto. While the Xerox Star series was a relative commercial success, it came too late. The expensive Xerox workstations could not compete against the cheaper GUI-based workstations that arose in the wake of the first Macintosh, and Xerox eventually quit the workstation market for good.

The hardware was designed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates, while Magnavox completed development and released it in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box that connects to a television set, and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots and one line of varying height on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to display additional visual elements for each game, and the one or two players for each game control their dots with the knobs and buttons on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The console cannot generate audio or track scores. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia to accompany the games, while a peripheral controller‚Äîthe first video game light gun‚Äîwas sold separately. The idea for a video game console was conceived by Baer in August 1966. Over the next three years he, along with Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch, created seven successive prototype consoles. The seventh, known as the Brown Box, was shown to several manufacturers before Magnavox agreed to produce it in January 1971. After releasing the console through their dealerships, Magnavox sold 69,000 units its first calendar year, and 350,000 by the time the console was discontinued in 1975. The console spawned the Odyssey series of dedicated consoles, as well as the 1978 Magnavox Odyssey 2. One of the 28 games made for the system, a ping pong game, was an inspiration for Atari's successful 1972 Pong arcade game, in turn driving sales of the Odyssey. Patents by Baer and the other developers for the system and the games, including what was termed by a judge as \\"the pioneering patent of the video game art\\", formed the basis of a series of lawsuits spanning 20 years, earning Sanders and Magnavox over US$100 million. The release of the Odyssey marked the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles and was an early part of the rise of the commercial video game industry. Design An Odyssey controller The Odyssey consists of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The console connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel on channel three or four, which thereafter became the standard for game consoles. The controllers, designed to sit on a flat surface, contain one button marked Reset on the top of the controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button resets individual elements depending on the game, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included; an optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen. Internally, the Odyssey architecture is composed of digital computing parts. The circuitry is implemented in diode‚Äìtransistor logic using discrete transistors and diodes. The games themselves do not use ROM cartridges like later consoles, but instead use \\"game cards\\" composed of printed circuit boards that plug into the console. These cards modify the internal circuitry like a set of switches or jumpers, causing the Odyssey to display different components and react to inputs differently. Multiple games use the same cards, with different instructions given to the player to change the style of game. Depiction of the Table Tennis game for the Odyssey, without any overlay The Odyssey is capable of displaying three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts the speed of the computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, such as changing the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling to create visuals. Games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game. In addition to the overlays, the Odyssey came with dice, poker chips, score sheets, play money, and card decks. One peripheral controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game light gun. Named the Shooting Gallery, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as a dot on the television screen. Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun. Development In 1951, while working for military contractor Loral Electronics, engineer Ralph H. Baer was assigned to build a television set; Baer later claimed that while doing so he had the idea to build something into a television set that the owner could control in addition to its normal function of receiving signals from a remote television station. Loral did not pursue the idea, but it returned to Baer in August 1966 while waiting for a bus. Baer, then the head of the Equipment Design Division at military contractor Sanders Associates, came up with the concept of using a television to play games, and the next morning wrote up a four-page proposal for a \\"game box\\" that would plug into a television screen, costing around US$25. The proposed device would transmit a signal that the television set could tune into like a television channel, which Baer referred to as Channel LP, short for \\"let's play\\", and he described several games that could be played on it. While electronic computer games had been developed since the start of the 1950s, they were typically only found in large academic or research institutions, and in 1966 no commercial games or video game industry existed, or any form of video games for consumer television sets. As a \\"game box\\" had little to do with the typical military contracts Sanders worked on, Baer picked an empty room and assigned one of his technicians, Bob Tremblay, to work on it with him rather than bring the idea to his bosses. By December 1966, they had completed an initial prototype later christened \\"TV Game #1\\", which could display and move a vertical line on a television screen. Baer demonstrated the prototype to the Sanders director of research and development, Herbert Campman, who hesitantly agreed to fund it for US$2,000 of labor and US$500 for materials, making it an official project. The 1969 \\"Brown Box\\" prototype Baer spent the next few months designing further prototypes, and in February 1967, assigned technician Bill Harrison to begin building the project. Harrison spent the next few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to the prototype. Baer, meanwhile, brainstormed with engineer Bill Rusch on ideas for games for the console, resulting in a proposal for the basis of many games later created for the system. Harrison began developing some early games in May, beginning with a two-player game where the players repeatedly press a button in competition to fill or empty a bucket of water, and by June multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box. These included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a light gun shooter game with a plastic rifle. Baer demonstrated the new prototype to Campman, who enjoyed the shooting game, increased funding, and recommended Baer demonstrate the project to senior management. Baer demonstrated the console to the board, who were largely uninterested, though a couple of members were enthusiastic; nevertheless, CEO Royden Sanders authorized the project to be continued with the aim of selling or licensing the console as a commercial product. By August 1967, Baer and Harrison completed a more focused prototype machine with fewer components, but found that to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a console would require so much to be excluded that the resulting product would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming up with a way to display a third, console-controlled spot on the screen in addition to the previous two player-controlled ones, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November, the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to sell the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics. Magnavox Odyssey Cartridge No 6 The team first approached the cable television industry, and the prototype attracted the attention of TelePrompter Corporation, who had seen it during a visit. After a few months of talks, cash-flow problems forced TelePrompter to back out in April 1968. The same economic downturn that caused TelePrompter's problems caused financial difficulties at Sanders as well, which put the project on hold after the fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs. It was picked up again in September, this time without Rusch, and went through two more iterations resulting in January 1969 in the seventh prototype, known as the \\"Brown Box\\" due to the wood-grain stickers on the casing. With the system now largely complete, as the team began filing for patents they were unsure whom to approach to sell it until a Sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers. Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm; only RCA wanted to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached. Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for Magnavox and convinced them to look at the console again. The creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969; they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Magnavox Console Products Planning Gerry Martin was in favor and Magnavox agreed to produce the console. After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971. A team from Magnavox led by George Kent turned the prototype console into a final product. They designed the exterior of the machine and re-engineered some the internals with consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns, and although they were becoming common by 1972 Magnavox did not redesign the circuitry to use them. The games for the system were designed by Ron Bradford of Bradford/Cout Design and adman Steve Lehner, based largely on the ones developed by Baer, Harrison, and Rusch. The product planning for the console was initially overseen by Bob Wiles of the color television division, but was turned over to product manager Bob Fritsche as its own category of product in September 1971. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O- Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, to go along with the plastic overlays for the games designed by Bradford that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to . Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox performed market surveys and playtests in Los Angeles and Grand Rapids, Michigan, and demonstrated it to dealers in Las Vegas in May 1972. The console was publicly unveiled at a press event at the Tavern on the Green in New York City on May 22, 1972. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, with availability restricted to dealers in 18 metropolitan areas, and demonstrated it for the next few months to Magnavox dealerships and media. Reception The Magnavox Odyssey at the 2010 Festival du Jeu Vid√©o Magnavox began advertising the Odyssey in mid-September 1972, including an appearance on the game show What's My Line? on October 16, 1972. As the term \\"video game\\" was not yet in use, the company described the console as \\"the new electronic game of the future\\" and \\"closed-circuit electronic playground\\". Magnavox initially ordered 50,000 units, but before release increased its production capabilities and built a larger inventory, as market testing found an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers, who handled their own advertising in their local markets; the company hoped that as the video game console was the first such product, consumers would visit its stores specifically for it. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972. Magnavox only sold 69,000 units. Baer believed that the low initial sales were due to the high price, and because Magnavox restricted sales to its dealerships and implied that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealers may have misled customers to sell more televisions, though starting in 1973 advertisements explicitly stated that the Odyssey worked with any \\"any brand TV, black and white or color\\". Customers unfamiliar with the new device, seeing it was only sold at Magnavox dealerships, may have misunderstood its interoperability. Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry said that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not the production run. After the initial holiday season Magnavox considered discontinuing the console, but the modest continuing demand, along with high customer satisfaction reports in surveys, convinced it to continue stocking the console. Magnavox published two catalogs each year, one before the Christmas season and another in for its annual sale in January. The Odyssey did not appear in the pre-Christmas 1972 catalog, but the January 1973 catalog depicted the console in a two-page spread with screenshots of bundled and optional games and the light gun. Fritsche's team proposed the creation of alternate versions of the Odyssey, a \\"lite\\" version with five games and a version of four controllers and a dozen new or updated games. Baer proposed an add-on that would add sound to games, and a putting controller and associated golf game. Magnavox rejected the proposals, instead releasing four games for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Emry. Although still only available at Magnavox dealers, national marketing for Odyssey began in late 1973. The company lowered the price to US$50 if purchased with a television. The console was released that year with different games in 12 other countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela. In late 1973, Magnavox ran a large advertising campaign for its 1974 products, including sponsoring Frank Sinatra's November television special Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back. Commercials during the special and advertisements for it showed the Odyssey and other Magnavox products. Continuing demand led Magnavox to manufacture an additional 27,000 units for the 1973 holiday season, selling 20,000 of them according to Baer. In 1974 Odyssey appeared in the Sears Wish Book. Magnavox sold 89,000 consoles in total in 1973, 129,000 Odyssey units in 1974, and 80,000 units in 1975. According to Baer the company sold 350,000 Odysseys in total worldwide, though Fritsche stated it reached 367,000. The light gun peripheral sold 20,000 units. Legacy National Medal of Technology in February 2006 Although there was continued customer demand for the console, Magnavox discontinued production of the Odyssey in fall of 1975. Rising inflation had raised the manufacturing cost of the system to Magnavox from roughly US$37 to US$47, and Magnavox was unable to raise the retail price to match. Instead, it sought a cheaper alternative; in May 1974 it signed a contract with Texas Instruments for integrated circuits to replace the transistors and diodes of the original system, and designed a limited version of the console around them. The result was the first of several dedicated consoles‚Äîconsoles that could only play games built into the system‚Äîin the Magnavox Odyssey series, the Magnavox Odyssey 100 and Magnavox Odyssey 200, as part of the first generation of video game consoles; the Odyssey 100 was only capable of playing the ping pong and hockey games from the original Odyssey, while the 200 also had the handball game and a rudimentary on-screen scoring system. The 100 and 200 were released in November 1975 to replace the Odyssey for US$69.95 and US$109.95, respectively. Eleven dedicated Odyssey consoles were produced before a follow-up non-dedicated console in 1978, the Magnavox Odyssey 2. While it showed the potential of video game consoles and was an early part of the rise of the commercial video game industry, the Odyssey is not generally considered a major commercial success. Magnavox produced no more games for the console after 1973 and rejected proposals for different versions of the console or accessories. While a few clone systems were produced in limited quantities, and multiple dedicated systems‚Äîgenerally focused on ping pong game variants‚Äîwere created by several companies, no other home video consoles capable of playing separately-produced games were released until the 1976 Fairchild Semiconductor Channel F. Due to his work on the Odyssey, Baer has been referred to as the \\"Father of Video Games\\". In 2004, Baer was awarded the National Medal of Technology for \\"his groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games, which spawned related uses, applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment and education realms\\". The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) added the Magnavox Odyssey to its permanent collection of video games in 2013. MoMA's Paul Galloway described the console as \\"a masterpiece of engineering and industrial design\\" and stated that it was \\"hard to overstate the importance of [Ralph Baer's] place in the birth of the industry\\". The Brown Box prototype and the TV Game #1 prototype are located in Washington, D.C. at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. =Lawsuits= Patent drawing for the Magnavox Odyssey In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief engineer Nolan Bushnell, designer of the first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw a demonstration of the Odyssey. Inspired, when he and Ted Dabney quit Nutting to found Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong (1972), which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In April 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors, including Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and arcade distributor Empire, for infringing on its patents for video games played on a television screen. Two more lawsuits joined it by 1975, against Sears, Nutting, Williams Electronics, and others. Baer later stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a set of patents by Baer and the development team‚Äîparticularly a pair which described how the Odyssey showed player- controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, with one patent by Baer and one by Rusch. The judge, John Grady, ruled in early 1977 that Baer's patent for the Odyssey constituted \\"the pioneering patent of the video game art\\", held the defendants' games as infringing, and set a precedent that any video game where a machine-controlled visual element hit and bounced off a player-controlled element violated Rusch's patent. At the time of judgement, only Seeburg Corporation and Chicago Dynamic Industries‚Äîthough bankrupt‚Äîremained out of the defendants of the initial three lawsuits, with all other companies having settled out of court. Atari's settlement, made in June 1976, granted it a license in exchange for US$1.5 million and access granted to Magnavox to all technology produced by Atari from June 1976 to June 1977; other defendants paid higher penalties. Over the next twenty years, Sanders and Magnavox sued several other companies over the issue, focusing on \\"paddle-and-ball\\" type games like Pong and Table Tennis that more clearly violated the patent; the final lawsuits ended in the mid 1990s. Defendants included Coleco, Mattel, Seeburg, and Activision; Sanders and Magnavox won or settled every lawsuit. Many of the defendants unsuccessfully attempted to claim that the patents only applied to the specific hardware implementations that Baer had used, or that they were invalidated by prior computer or electronic games. In 1985, Nintendo sued and tried to invalidate the patents, claiming as prior art the 1958 Tennis for Two game built by William Higinbotham. The court, however, ruled that the oscilloscope-based game did not use video signals and therefore did not qualify as a video game, and ruled again in favor of Magnavox and Sanders. Magnavox won more than US$100 million in the various lawsuits and settlements involving the Odyssey related patents before they expired in the early 1990s. Games A total of 28 games distributed on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were included with the console‚Äîa set of 12 in America and a different set of 10 in other countries‚Äîwith six others available for purchase either individually or in a bundle; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, Percepts, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, Shooting Gallery, was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973. The console does not enforce game rules or keep track of score for the games; that is left up to the players. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + - ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"13%\\"Title ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"3%\\"Game card !

By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing; that is, pressing any of the , , or keys alone does not (generally) trigger any action from the computer. For example, in most keyboard layouts the Shift key combination will produce a capital letter \\"A\\" instead of the default lower- case letter \\"a\\" (unless in Caps lock or Shift lock mode). A combination of in Microsoft Windows will close the active window; in this instance, Alt is the modifier key. In contrast, pressing just or will probably do nothing unless assigned a specific function in a particular program (for example, activating input aids or the toolbar of the active window in Windows). User interface expert Jef Raskin coined the term \\"quasimode\\" to describe the state a computer enters into when a modifier key is pressed. Modifier keys on typewriters * Modifier keys on personal computers The most common are:  (Control) * (Alternate) ‚Äì also labelled on Apple Macintosh keyboards * (Alternate Graphic) * ‚Äì Meta key, found on MIT, Symbolics, and Sun Microsystems keyboards * (Windows logo) ‚Äì found on Windows keyboards * ‚Äì Command key, found on Apple Macintosh keyboards. On older keyboards marked with the Apple logo. * (Function) ‚Äì present on small-layout keyboard, usually on notebooks. The (Sun) Meta key, Windows key, (Apple) Cmd key, and the analogous \\"Amiga key\\"() on Amiga computers, are usually handled equivalently. Under the GNU/Linux operating system, the desktop environment KDE calls this key Meta, while GNOME calls this key, neutrally, Super. (This is a bit confusing, since the original space-cadet keyboard and the X Window System recognize a \\"\\" modifier distinct from \\"\\".) The Sinclair ZX Spectrum has a Symbol Shift key in addition to Caps Shift. This was used to access additional punctuation and keywords. The MSX computer keyboard, besides Shift and Control, also included two special modifier keys, Code and Graph. In some models, as in the Brazilian Gradiente Expert, the Code and Graph keys are labelled \\"\\" and \\"\\" (Left and Right Graphics). They are used to select special graphic symbols and extended characters. Likewise, the Commodore 64 and other Commodore computers had the Commodore key at the bottom left of the keyboard. Compact keyboards, such as those used in laptops, often have a Fn key to save space by combining two functions that are normally on separate keys. On laptops, pressing plus one of the function keys, e.g., F2, often control hardware functions. Keyboards that lack a dedicated numeric keypad may mimic its functionality by combining the Fn key with other keys. The MIT space-cadet keyboard had additional Top, Front, Super and Hyper modifier keys. Combined with standard modifiers, it could enter as many as 8,000 different characters. =Accented characters= Some non-English language keyboards have special keys to produce accented modifications of the standard Latin-letter keys. In fact, the standard British keyboard layout includes an accent key on the top-left corner to produce √†√®√¨√≤√π, although this is a two step procedure, press the accent key and release, then the letter key. These kinds of keys are called dead keys. The AltGr modifier produces the √°√©√≠√≥√∫ sequence, or in conjunction with the Shift key, √Å√â√ç√ì√ö. Keyboards of some languages simply include the accented characters on their own keys. Some keyboards also have a Compose key for typing accented and other special characters. By pressing , and then two other keys, something similar to a combination of the glyphs of the two previous keys will appear on the screen.  Dual-role keys  It is possible to use (with some utility software) one same key both as a normal key and as a modifier. For example, you can use the both as a normal Space bar and as a Shift. Intuitively, it'll be a Space when you want a whitespace, and a Shift when you want it to act as a shift. I.e. when you simply press and release it, it is the usual space, but when you press other keys, say , and , while holding down the , then they will be treated as plus X, Y and Z. The above example is known as \\"SandS\\", standing for \\"Space and Shift\\" in Japan. But any number of any combinations are possible. To press shift+space in the previous example, you need in addition to a space/shift dual role key, one of (a) another space/shift key, (b) a usual shift, or (c) a usual space key.

Reacting to a prophecy from his mother Gaia that his own offspring would overthrow his supreme position in the pantheon, Cronus swallowed all of his children immediately after birth. Rhea, Zeus' mother and Cronus' wife, deceived Cronus by giving him a stone wrapped to look like a baby instead of Zeus, whom she instead gave to Adamanthea to nurse.

When Apollo was sentenced to a year of servitude to a mortal as punishment for killing Delphyne, or as later tradition has it, the Cyclopes, the god was sent to Admetus' home to serve as his herdsman.Pseudo- Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, Book 3.10.4. Apollo in recompense for Admetus' treatment made all the cows bear twins while he served as his cowherd.Scholia. ad Euripides. Alcestis, 2 The romantic nature of their relationship was first described by Callimachus of Alexandria, who wrote that Apollo was \\"fired with love\\" for Admetus.Callimachus, Hymn to Apollo Plutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo's lovers and says that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him.Plutarch, 'Amatorius 17 Latin poet Ovid in his Ars Amatoria said that even though he was a god, Apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus.Ovid, Ars Amatoria 2.239 Tibullus describes Apollo's love to the king as servitium amoris (slavery of love) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice.Tibullus, Elegies 2.3 Apollo later helped Admetus win the hand of Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, king of Iolcus. Alcestis had so many suitors that Pelias set an apparently impossible task to the suitors‚Äîto win the hand of Alcestis, they must yoke a boar and a lion to a chariot. Apollo harnessed the yoke with the animalsPseudo- Apollodorus, Bibliotheke 1.9.15; Hyginus, Fabulae, 50 and Admetus drove the chariot to Pelias, and thus married Alcestis. Admetus, however, neglected to sacrifice to Artemis, Apollo's sister. The offended goddess filled the bridal chamber with snakes and again, Apollo came to Admetus' aid. Apollo advised Admetus to sacrifice to Artemis, and the goddess removed the snakes. = Heroism of Alcestis = Frederic Lord Leighton, England (c. 1869-1871) The greatest aid Apollo gave to Admetus was persuading the Fates to reprieve Admetus of his fated day of death. According to Aeschylus Apollo made the Fates drunk, and the Fates agreed to reprieve Admetus if he could find someone to die in his place.Aeschylus, Eumenides, 728. Admetus initially believed that one of his aged parents would happily take their son's place of death. When they were unwilling, Alcestis instead died for Admetus. The scene of death is described in Euripides' play Alcestis, where Thanatos, the god of death, takes Alcestis to the Underworld. As Alcestis descends, Admetus discovers that he actually does not want to live: :\\"I think my wife's fate is happier than my own, even though it may not seem so. No pain will ever touch her now, and she has ended life's many troubles with glory. But I, who have escaped my fate and ought not to be alive, shall now live out my life in sorrow.\\" The situation was saved by Heracles, who rested at Pherae on his way towards the man-eating Mares of Diomedes. Heracles was greatly impressed by Admetus's kind treatment of him as a guest, and when told of Admetus' situation, he entered Alcestis' tomb. He repaid the honor Admetus had done to him by wrestling with Thanatos until the god agreed to release Alcestis, then led her back into the mortal world. According to other accounts, Persephone, queen of the Underworld instead brought Alcestis back to the upper world.

Her life story was told by pseudo-Apollodorus in his Bibliotheca,Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus Pseudo- Apollodorus) and a version of her death and return from the dead was also popularized in Euripides's tragedy Alcestis.  Family  Alcestis was the fairest among the daughters of Pelias, king of Iolcus, and either Anaxibia or Phylomache. She was sister to Acastus, Pisidice, Pelopia and Hippothoe.Pseudo- Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.9.10 Alcestis was the wife of Admetus by whom she bore a son, Eumelus, a participant in the siege of Troy, and a daughter, Perimele.Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphosis 23  Mythology  Many suitors appeared before King Pelias and tried to woo Alcestis when she came of age to marry. It was declared by her father that she would marry the first man to yoke a lion and a boar (or a bear in some cases) to a chariot. The man who would do this, King Admetus, was helped by Apollo, who had been banished from Olympus for one year to serve as a shepherd to Admetus. With Apollo's help, Admetus completed the challenge set by King Pelias, and was allowed to marry Alcestis. But in a sacrifice after the wedding, Admetus forgot to make the required offering to Artemis, therefore when he opened the marriage chamber he found his bed full of coiled snakes.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.9.15 Admetus interpreted it a portent of an early death.Roman, L., & Roman, M. (2010). Apollo again helped the newlywed king, this time by making the Fates drunk, extracting from them a promise that if anyone would want to die instead of Admetus, they would allow it. And when the day of his death came near, no one volunteered, not even his elderly parents, but Alcestis stepped forth to die in his stead. Shortly after fighting with Thanatos, Heracles rescued Alcestis from the underworld as a token of appreciation for Admetus' hospitality.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.6.2 In some accounts Persephone, 'the Maiden', sent her up again. But when she comes back alive she is mute. She chooses not to speak.

The Murder of Pelias by His Daughters, Georges Moreau de Tours (1878)Pelias (; Ancient Greek: Œ†ŒµŒªŒØŒ±œÇ) was king of Iolcus in Greek mythology. The son of Tyro and the god Poseidon, he was the one who sent Jason on the quest for the Golden Fleece.  Family  Pelias was the son of Tyro and Poseidon.

Pausanias refers to the painter Micon for the names, and notes that the sisters were never mentioned by names in any poetic works known to him. and MedusaHyginus. Fabulae, 24. Mythology =Early years= Tyro was married to King Cretheus of Iolcus, with whom she had three sons, Aeson, Pher√™s, and Amythaon, but she loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus and lay with her - from their union were born twin sons, Pelias and Neleus. Tyro exposed her sons on a mountain to die, but they were found by a herdsman who raised them as his own, as one story goes, or they were raised by a maid. When they reached adulthood, Pelias and Neleus found Tyro and killed her stepmother Sidero for having mistreated her (Sidero hid in a temple dedicated to Hera but Pelias killed her anyway, causing Hera's undying hatred of Pelias). Pelias was power-hungry and he wished to gain dominion over all of Thessaly. To this end, he banished Neleus and Pher√™s, and locked Aeson in the dungeons in Iolcus (by the modern city of Volos). While in the dungeons, Aeson married and had several children, most famously, Jason. Aeson sent Jason away from Iolcus in fear that Pelias would have him killed as a potential heir to the throne. Jason grew in the care of Chiron the centaur, on the slopes of Mount Pelion, to be educated while Pelias, fearing that he would be overthrown, was warned by an oracle to beware a man wearing one sandal. =Quest for the Golden Fleece= Many years later, Pelias offered a sacrifice by the sea in honor of Poseidon. Jason, who was summoned with many others to take part in the sacrifice, lost one of his sandals in the flooded river Anaurus while rushing to Iolcus. In Virgil's Aeneid and Hyginus' Fabulae (13), Hera/Juno disguised herself as an old woman, whom Jason helped across the river when he lost his sandal. When Jason entered Iolcus, he was announced as a man wearing one sandal. Fearful, Pelias asked Jason what he would do if confronted with the man who would be his downfall. Jason responded that he would send that man after the Golden Fleece. Pelias took Jason's advice and sent him to retrieve the Golden Fleece. It would be found at Colchis, in a grove sacred to Ares, the god of war. Though the Golden Fleece simply hung on an oak tree, this was a seemingly impossible task, as an ever-watchful dragon guarded it.Apollodorus The Library of Greek Mythology. Trans. Robin Hard. New York: Oxford University Press Inc., 1997. 48-49. Print. Jason made preparations by commanding the shipwright Argus to build a ship large enough for fifty men, which he would eventually call the Argo. These heroes who would join his quest were known as the Argonauts. Upon their arrival, Jason requested the Golden Fleece from the king of Colchis, Ae√´tes. Ae√´tes demanded that Jason must first yoke a pair of fire-breathing bulls to a plough and sow dragon's teeth into the earth. Medea, daughter of Ae√´tes, fell in love with Jason, and being endowed with magical powers, aided him in his completion of the difficult task. She cast a spell to put the dragon to sleep, enabling Jason to obtain the Golden Fleece from the oak tree. Jason, Medea, and the Argonauts fled Colchis and began their journey home to Thessaly.Collier, P. F. \\"Jason.\\" Collier's Encyclopedia. Ed. William D. Halsey and Emanuel Friedman. 1981. 504-05. Print. =Death of Pelias= Pelias sends forth Jason, in an 1879 illustration from Stories from the Greek Tragedians by Alfred Church. During Jason's absence, Pelias thought the Argo had sunk, and this was what he told Aeson and Promachus, who committed suicide by drinking poison. However, it is unknown but possible that the two were both killed directly by Pelias. When Jason and Medea returned, Pelias still refused to give up his throne. Medea conspired to have Pelias' own daughters (the Peliades) kill him. She told them she could turn an old ram into a young ram by cutting up the old ram and boiling it. During the demonstration, a live, young ram jumped out of the pot. Excited, the girls cut their father into pieces and threw them into a pot, in the expectation that he would emerge rejuvenated. Pelias, of course, did not survive. As he was now an accessory to a terrible crime, Jason was still not made king. Pelias' son Acastus later banished Jason and Medea, to Corinth, and so reclaimed the kingdom. An alternate telling of the story has Medea slitting the throat of Jason's father Aeson, who she then really does revive as a much younger man; Pelias' daughters then slit their father's throat after she promises to do the same for him, and she merely breaks her word and leaves him dead.

In Ovid's first-century AD telling of the myth, he was conceived after Aphrodite cursed his mother Myrrha to lust after her own father, King Cinyras of Cyprus. Myrrha had sex with her father in complete darkness for nine nights, but he discovered her identity and chased her with a sword. The gods transformed her into a myrrh tree and, in the form of a tree, she gave birth to Adonis. Aphrodite found the infant and gave him to be raised by Persephone, the queen of the Underworld. Adonis grew into an astonishingly handsome young man, causing Aphrodite and Persephone to feud over him, with Zeus eventually decreeing that Adonis would spend one third of the year in the Underworld with Persephone, one third of the year with Aphrodite, and the final third of the year with whomever he chose. Adonis chose to spend his final third of the year with Aphrodite. One day, Adonis was gored by a wild boar during a hunting trip and died in Aphrodite's arms as she wept. His blood mingled with her tears and became the anemone flower. Aphrodite declared the Adonia festival commemorating his tragic death, which was celebrated by women every year in midsummer. During this festival, Greek women would plant \\"gardens of Adonis\\", small pots containing fast-growing plants, which they would set on top of their houses in the hot sun. The plants would sprout, but soon wither and die. Then the women would mourn the death of Adonis, tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief. The Greeks considered Adonis's cult to be of Near Eastern origin. Adonis's name comes from a Canaanite word meaning \\"lord\\" and most modern scholars consider the story of Aphrodite and Adonis to be derived from the earlier Mesopotamian myth of Inanna (Ishtar) and Dumuzid (Tammuz). In late nineteenth and early twentieth century scholarship of religion, Adonis was widely seen as a prime example of the archetypal dying-and-rising god, but the existence of the \\"dying-and- rising god\\" archetype has been largely rejected by modern scholars. His name is often applied in modern times to handsome youths, of whom he is the archetype. Cult = Origin = An ancient Sumerian depiction of the marriage of Inanna and Dumuzid The worship of Aphrodite and Adonis is probably a Greek continuation of the ancient Sumerian worship of Inanna and Dumuzid. The Greek name ('), ) is derived from the Canaanite word  ºad≈çn, meaning \\"lord\\".R. S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 23. This word is related to Adonai (), one of the titles used to refer to the God of the Hebrew Bible and still used in Judaism to the present day. The Syrian name for Adonis is Gaus. The cult of Inanna and Dumuzid may have been introduced to the Kingdom of Judah during the reign of King Manasseh. mentions Adonis under his earlier East Semitic name Tammuz and describes a group of women mourning Tammuz's death while sitting near the north gate of the Temple in Jerusalem. The earliest known Greek reference to Adonis comes from a fragment of a poem by the Lesbian poet Sappho (c. 630 ‚Äì c. 570 BC), in which a chorus of young girls asks Aphrodite what they can do to mourn Adonis' death. Aphrodite replies that they must beat their breasts and tear their tunics. The cult of Adonis has also been described as corresponding to the cult of the Phoenician god Baal. As Walter Burkert explains: The exact date when the worship of Adonis became integrated into Greek culture is still disputed. Walter Burkert questions whether Adonis had not from the very beginning come to Greece along with Aphrodite. \\"In Greece,\\" Burkert concludes, \\"the special function of the Adonis legend is as an opportunity for the unbridled expression of emotion in the strictly circumscribed life of women, in contrast to the rigid order of polis and family with the official women's festivals in honour of Demeter.\\" The significant influence of Near Eastern culture on early Greek religion in general, and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular, is now widely recognized as dating to a period of orientalization during the eighth century BC, when archaic Greece was on the fringes of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. In Cyprus, the cult of Adonis gradually superseded that of Cinyras. W. Atallah suggests that the later Hellenistic myth of Adonis represents the conflation of two independent traditions.Atallah 1966 =Festival of Adonia= Fragment of an Attic red-figure wedding vase ( 430‚Äì420 BC), showing women climbing ladders up to the roofs of their houses carrying \\"gardens of Adonis\\" The worship of Adonis is associated with the festival of the Adonia, which was celebrated by Greek women every year in midsummer.W. Atallah, Adonis dans la litt√©rature et l'art grecs, Paris, 1966. The festival, which was evidently already celebrated in Lesbos by Sappho's time in the seventh century BC, seems to have first become popular in Athens in the mid-fifth century BC. At the start of the festival, the women would plant a \\"garden of Adonis\\", a small garden planted inside a small basket or a shallow piece of broken pottery containing a variety of quick-growing plants, such as lettuce and fennel, or even quick-sprouting grains such as wheat and barley. The women would then climb ladders to the roofs of their houses, where they would place the gardens out under the heat of the summer sun. The plants would sprout in the sunlight, but wither quickly in the heat. While they waited for the plants to first sprout and then wither, the women would burn incense to Adonis. Once the plants had withered, the women would mourn and lament loudly over the death of Adonis, tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief. The women would lay a statuette of Adonis out on a bier and then carry it to the sea along with all the withered plants as a funeral procession. The festival concluded with the women throwing the effigy of Adonis and the withered plants out to sea.  In classical literature  = Ovid's Metamorphoses = red-figure aryballos painting by Aison ( 410 BC) showing Adonis consorting with Aphrodite While Sappho does not describe the myth of Adonis, later sources flesh out the details. According to the retelling of the story found in the poem Metamorphoses by the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC ‚Äì 17/18 AD), Adonis was the son of Myrrha, who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King Cinyras of Cyprus,Ovid, Metamorphoses X, 298‚Äì518 after Myrrha's mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess. Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a myrrh tree, but still gave birth to Adonis. According to classicist William F. Hansen, the story of how Adonis was conceived falls in line with the conventional ideas about sex and gender that were prevalent in the classical world, since the Greeks and Romans believed that women, such as Adonis's mother Myrrha, were less capable of controlling their primal wants and passions than men. Aphrodite found the baby, and took him to the underworld to be fostered by Persephone. She returned for him once he was grown and discovered him to be strikingly handsome. Persephone wanted to keep Adonis; Zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that Adonis would spend one third of the year with Aphrodite, one third with Persephone, and one third with whomever he chose. Adonis chose Aphrodite, and they remained constantly together. Then, one day while Adonis was out hunting, he was wounded by a wild boar, and bled to death in Aphrodite's arms. In different versions of the story, the boar was either sent by Ares, who was jealous that Aphrodite was spending so much time with Adonis, by Artemis, who wanted revenge against Aphrodite for having killed her devoted follower Hippolytus, or by Apollo, to punish Aphrodite for blinding his son Erymanthus.According to Nonnus, Dionysiaca 42.1f. Servius on Virgil's Eclogues x.18; Orphic Hymn lv.10; Ptolemy Hephaestionos, i.306u, all noted by Graves. Atallah (1966) fails to find any cultic or cultural connection with the boar, which he sees simply as a heroic myth-element. The story also provides an etiology for Aphrodite's associations with certain flowers. Reportedly, as she mourned Adonis's death, she caused anemones to grow wherever his blood fell, and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death. = Other Loves = Adonis was also said to have been loved by other gods such as Apollo, Heracles and Dionysus. He was described as androgynous for he acted like a man in his affections for Aphrodite but as a woman for Apollo.Ptolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 5 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190) \\"Androgynous\\" here means that Adonis took on the passive feminine role in his love with Apollo. Heracles' love of Adonis is mentioned in passing by Ptolemy Hephaestion. The text states that due to his love of Adonis, Aphrodite taught Nessos the centaur the trap to ensnare him.Ptolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 2 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190) Another tradition stated that Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and madness, carried off Adonis.Phanocles ap.Plut. Sumpos. iv. 5. = Other versions = The Adonis River (now known as the Abraham River) in Lebanon was said to run red with blood each year during the festival of Adonis. In Idyll 15 by the early third-century BC Greek bucolic poet Theocritus, Adonis is described as a still an adolescent with down on his cheeks at the time of his love affair with Aphrodite, in contrast to Ovid's Metamorphoses in which he is portrayed as a fully mature man. Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheke, 3.182) describes Adonis as the son of Cinyras, of Paphos on Cyprus, and Metharme. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus's Bibliotheke, Hesiod, in an unknown work that does not survive, made of him the son of Phoenix and the otherwise unidentified Alphesiboea.Ps.-Apollodorus, iii.14.4.1. In one version of the story, Aphrodite injured herself on a thorn from a rose bush and the rose, which had previously been white, was stained red by her blood. In other version an anemone flower grew on the spot where Adonis died, and a red rose where Aphrodite's tears fell.Roman, L., & Roman, M. (2010). The third century BC poet Euphorion of Chalcis remarked in his Hyacinth that \\"Only Cocytus washed the wounds of Adonis\\".Remarked upon in passing by Photius, Biblioteca 190 (on-line translation). According to Lucian's De Dea Syria, each year during the festival of Adonis, the Adonis River in Lebanon (now known as the Abraham River) ran red with blood.  In post-classical literature culture  The medieval French poet Jean de Meun retells the story of Adonis in his additions to the Roman de la Rose, written in around 1275. De Muen moralizes the story, using it as an example of how men should heed the warnings of the women they love. In Pierre de Ronsard's poem \\"Adonis\\" (1563), Venus laments that Adonis did not heed her warning, but ultimately blames herself for his death, declaring, \\"In need my counsel failed you.\\" In the same poem, however, Venus quickly finds another shepherd as her lover, representing the widespread medieval belief in the fickleness and mutability of women. The story of Venus and Adonis from Ovid's Metamorphoses was tremendously influential during the Elizabethan era. In Edmund Spenser's epic poem The Faerie Queene (1590), tapestries depicting the story of Adonis decorate the walls of Castle Joyous. Later in the poem, Venus takes the character Amoretta to raise her in the \\"Garden of Adonis\\". Ovid's portrayal of Venus's desperate love for Adonis became the inspiration for many literary portrayals in Elizabethan literature of both male and female courtship. William Shakespeare's erotic narrative poem Venus and Adonis (1593), a retelling of the courtship of Aphrodite and Adonis from Ovid's Metamorphoses, was the most popular of all his works published within his own lifetime. Six editions of it were published before Shakespeare's death (more than any of his other works) and it enjoyed particularly strong popularity among young adults. In 1605, Richard Barnfield lauded it, declaring that the poem had placed Shakespeare's name \\"in fames immortall Booke\\". Despite this, the poem has received mixed reception from modern critics. Samuel Taylor Coleridge defended it, but Samuel Butler complained that it bored him and C. S. Lewis described an attempted reading of it as \\"suffocating\\". The story of Adonis was the inspiration for the Italian poet Giambattista Marino to write his mythological epic L'Adone (1623), which outsold Shakespeare's First Folio. Marino's poem focuses on the pleasures of love, which it describes explicitly. It describes Adonis as shooting the boar with Cupid's arrow and proclaims the tusk that crushes his hip a \\"loving\\" one. Shakespeare's homoerotic descriptions of Adonis's beauty and Venus's masculine pursuit of him inspired the French novelist and playwright Rachilde (Marguerite Vallette-Eymery) to write her erotic novel Monsieur V√©nus (1884), about a noblewoman named Raoule de V√©n√©rande who sexually pursues a young, effeminate man named Jacques who works in a flower shop. Jacques is ultimately shot and killed in a duel, thus following the model of Adonis's tragic death. =As a dying and rising god= Sir James George Frazer, the anthropologist who is most directly responsible for promoting the concept of a \\"dying and rising god\\" archetype The late nineteenth-century Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer wrote extensively about Adonis in his monumental study of comparative religion The Golden Bough (the first edition of which was published in 1890) as well as in later works. Frazer claimed that Adonis was just one example of the archetype of a \\"dying-and-rising god\\" found throughout all cultures. In the mid-twentieth century, some scholars began to criticize the designation of \\"dying-and-rising god\\", in some cases arguing that deities like Adonis, previously referred to as \\"dying and rising\\", would be better termed separately as \\"dying gods\\" and \\"disappearing gods\\", asserting that gods who \\"died\\" did not return, and those who returned never \\"really\\" died. Biblical scholars Eddy and Boyd (2007) applied this rationale to Adonis based on the fact that his portion of the year spent in the Underworld with Persephone is not really a death and resurrection, but merely an instance of a living person staying in the Underworld. They further argued that Adonis is not explicitly described as rising from the dead in any extant Classical Greek writings, though the fact that such a belief existed is attested by authors in Late Antiquity. For example, Origen discusses Adonis, whom he associates with Tammuz, in his Selecta in Ezechielem ( ‚ÄúComments on Ezekiel‚Äù), noting that \\"they say that for a long time certain rites of initiation are conducted: first, that they weep for him, since he has died; second, that they rejoice for him because he has risen from the dead (apo nekr√¥n anastanti)\\" (cf. J.-P. Migne, Patrologiae Cursus Completus: Series Graeca, 13:800). Some other scholars have continued to cite Adonis/Tammuz as an example of a dying and rising god, suggesting that the descent into and return from the underworld is a functional analogue for death even if no physical cause of death is depicted.

The Siberian rubythroat and similar small European species are often called chats. It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in mixed coniferous forests with undergrowth in Siberia. It nests near the ground. It winters in Thailand, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh (See wintering range map). It is an extremely rare vagrant to Western Europe, having occurred on a very few occasions as far west as Britain. It is also an extremely rare vagrant to the Aleutian Islands, most notably on Attu Island. This species is slightly larger than the European robin. It is plain brown above except for the distinctive black tail with red side patches. It has a strong white supercilium. The male has a red throat edged with a narrow black and then a broad white border. It has a strong white supercilium. Females lack the brightly coloured throat and borders.

It, and similar small European species, are often called chats. It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in forests in Europe and the Palearctic and overwintering in Africa. The distribution is more northerly than the very closely related common nightingale, Luscinia megarhynchos, which it closely resembles in appearance. It nests near the ground in dense undergrowth. The thrush nightingale is similar in size to the European robin. It is plain greyish-brown above and white and greyish-brown below. Its greyer tones, giving a cloudy appearance to the underside, and lack of the common nightingale's obvious rufous tail side patches are the clearest plumage differences from that species. Sexes are similar. It has a similar but more powerful song than that of the nightingale. Etymology \\"Nightingale\\" is derived from \\"night\\", and the Old English galan, \\"to sing\\". The genus name Luscinia is Latin for the common nightingale. Description A singing male above and a juvenile below An adult thrush nightingale is about long with a wingspan of approximately . The head, nape and the whole of the upper parts of the thrush nightingale are dark brown with a slight olive tinge. The colour is much deeper than that of the nightingale and is not at all rufous. The upper tail-coverts are less olivaceous and the tail feathers are dark rufous-brown. The lores and ear-coverts are brownish-black and the chin and throat are pale buff or whitish, mottled with brown, and are paler in colour than the nightingale. The sides of the throat are spotted brown and the pale feathers of the breast have brown central bands giving the breast a mottled appearance. The under tail-coverts are buff, sometimes barred or marked with brown. The wing feathers and wing-coverts are dark brown and less rufous than the nightingale. The beak, legs and feet are brown and the irises are dark brown. The sexes are similar to each other in appearance and the juveniles are darker and more mottled. There is a single moult in July and August at the end of the breeding season. Voice The sonograms of Luscinia luscinia and Luscinia megarhynchos singing help to distinguish these two species by voice definitely. The male's is loud, with a range of whistles, trills and clicks and includes a flute-like \\"pioo\\" with a pure bell-like tone. It is sometimes interrupted by a rasping \\"dserr\\" sound and is rather solemn as compared to that of the nightingale. The song does not have that bird's loud whistling crescendo and is quite distinctive. It is also sometimes sung in the bird's winter quarters. The call-note \\"whit\\" resembles that of the nightingale but is higher pitched and more abrupt. Distribution and habitat The thrush nightingale is a migrant species. It breeds in eastern Europe and the western part of temperate Asia. Its northern limit of its summer range extends to Denmark, southern Norway and Sweden, the Baltic States, the Republic of Karelia, Kostroma, Vologda, Perm, Kazakhstan, Turkestan and Altai. The southern limit extends from Austria and the Czech Republic, through Romania, Bulgaria, southern Russia, Ukraine, the Crimea and northern Caucasus. It overwinters in Africa south of the Sahara. It is an occasional visitor to the British Isles. In its breeding range, the thrush nightingale is found in damp deciduous woodland typically with alder and birch. It favours thick undergrowth with brambles, dense shrubs and tangled vegetation in swampy places and near water. In its winter quarters it is found in dense patches of thorn bush, especially in valley bottoms near water courses, and sometimes in thick vegetation at the edge of woodland. The bird is a host of the acanthocephalan intestinal parasite Apororhynchus silesiacus. Behaviour In Poland Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden, Germany The thrush nightingale feeds chiefly on the ground taking earthworms, spiders and the adults, larvae and pupae of insects such as beetles, small moths, ants and flies. In the autumn, the berries of currants (Ribes spp.) and elders (Sambucus spp.) are also eaten. Before crossing the Sahara on its migration, thrush nightingales build up their fat reserves. It has been found experimentally that magnetic cues may stimulate the birds to do this. A simulation of the magnetic field found in northern Egypt encouraged birds preparing to migrate from Sweden to further build up their body fat. The thrush nightingale breeds in damp forests, nesting on the ground, often in the middle of a bed of stinging nettles (Urtica dioica). The nest rests on a platform of dead leaves and is composed of dead grass stalks, bents (Agrostis spp.), sedges and stems, lined with finer material. It is built by the female which lays four or five (occasionally six) eggs. These are a milky-blue colour, usually plain but sometimes with a slight speckling of rusty-brown and measure an average of . The hen incubates the eggs which hatch in about thirteen days. The young are fed by both parents and fledge when about eleven days old, but are not fully independent for another twelve days or so. Status BirdLife International estimates that there are between 11 and 20 million thrush nightingales in Europe and that, as Europe forms somewhere between 50% and 74% of the bird's global range, the total world population may be between 15 and 41 million individuals. In Europe, the population seems to be increasingly slightly. The bird is considered to be of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN.

Research in Germany found that favoured breeding habitat of nightingales was defined by a number of geographical factors.

Despite local efforts to safeguard its favoured coppice and scrub habitat, numbers fell by 53 percent between 1995 and 2008. A survey conducted by the British Trust for Ornithology in 2012 and 2013 recorded some 3,300 territories, with most of these clustered in a few counties in the southeast of England, notably Kent, Essex, Suffolk, and East and West Sussex. By contrast, the European breeding population is estimated at between 3.2 and 7 million pairs, giving it green conservation status (least concern). Behaviour and ecology Common nightingales are so named because they frequently sing at night as well as during the day. The name has been used for more than 1,000 years, being highly recognisable even in its Old English form nihtegale, which means \\"night songstress\\". Early writers assumed the female sang when it is in fact the male. The song is loud, with an impressive range of whistles, trills and gurgles. Its song is particularly noticeable at night because few other birds are singing. This is why its name includes \\"night\\" in several languages. Only unpaired males sing regularly at night, and nocturnal song probably serves to attract a mate. Singing at dawn, during the hour before sunrise, is assumed to be important in defending the bird's territory. Nightingales sing even more loudly in urban or near-urban environments, in order to overcome the background noise. The most characteristic feature of the song is a loud whistling crescendo, absent from the song of thrush nightingale. It has a frog-like alarm call. The bird is a host of the acanthocephalan intestinal parasite Apororhynchus silesiacus. Cultural connotations The common nightingale is an important symbol for poets from a variety of ages, and has taken on a number of symbolic connotations. Homer evokes the nightingale in the Odyssey, suggesting the myth of Philomela and Procne (one of whom, depending on the myth's version, is turned into a nightingale). This myth is the focus of Sophocles' tragedy, Tereus, of which only fragments remain. Ovid, too, in his Metamorphoses, includes the most popular version of this myth, imitated and altered by later poets, including Chr√©tien de Troyes, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, and George Gascoigne. T.S. Eliot's \\"The Waste Land\\" also evokes the common nightingale's song (and the myth of Philomela and Procne). Because of the violence associated with the myth, the nightingale's song was long interpreted as a lament. The common nightingale has also been used as a symbol of poets or their poetry. Poets chose the nightingale as a symbol because of its creative and seemingly spontaneous song. Aristophanes's Birds and Callimachus both evoke the bird's song as a form of poetry. Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus to the ‚Äúlament of the nightingale‚Äù. In Sonnet 102 Shakespeare compares his love poetry to the song of the common nightingale (Philomel): ::\\"Our love was new, and then but in the spring, ::When I was wont to greet it with my lays; ::As Philomel in summer's front doth sing, ::And stops his pipe in growth of riper days:\\" During the Romantic era the bird's symbolism changed once more: poets viewed the nightingale not only as a poet in his own right, but as ‚Äúmaster of a superior art that could inspire the human poet‚Äù. For some romantic poets, the nightingale even began to take on qualities of the muse. The nightingale has a long history with symbolic associations ranging from \\"creativity, the muse, nature's purity, and, in Western spiritual tradition, virtue and goodness.\\" Coleridge and Wordsworth saw the nightingale more as an instance of natural poetic creation: the nightingale became a voice of nature. John Keats' \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" pictures the nightingale as an idealized poet who has achieved the poetry that Keats longs to write. Invoking a similar conception of the nightingale, Shelley wrote in his ‚ÄúA Defense of Poetry\\": ::\\"A poet is a nightingale who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.‚Äù The nightingale is the national bird of Ukraine. One legend tells how nightingales once only lived in India, when one nightingale visited Ukraine. Hearing sad songs from the people, the nightingale sang its song to cheer them up. The people responded with happy songs, and since then, nightingales have visited Ukraine every spring to hear Ukrainian songs.

It, and similar small European species, are often called chats. It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in wet birch wood or bushy swamp in Europe and across the Palearctic with a foothold in western Alaska. It nests in tussocks or low in dense bushes. It winters in north Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The bluethroat is similar in size to the European robin at 13‚Äì14 cm. It is plain brown above except for the distinctive black tail with red side patches. It has a strong white supercilium. The male has an iridescent blue bib edged below with successive black, white and rust coloured borders. Some subspecies, such as L. svecica svecica (red-spotted bluethroat) of northern Eurasia, have a red spot in the centre of the blue bib. Others, such as L. svecica cyanecula (white-spotted bluethroat) of southern and central Europe, have a white spot in the centre of the blue bib. L. svecica magna in Turkey has no central spot. Females of all subspecies usually have just a blackish crescent on an otherwise cream throat and breast. Newly fledged juveniles are freckled and spotted dark brown above. Despite the distinctive appearance of the males, recent genetic studies show only limited variation between the forms, and confirm that this is a single species. Moults begins in July after breeding and is completed in 40‚Äì45 days, before the birds migrate.RSPB Handbook of British Birds (2014). UK . The male has a varied and very imitative song.Metzmacher M.

Etymology Calling The genus name Luscinia is Latin for the common nightingale and svecica is New Latin. The colours of the male's breast were thought to evoke the Swedish flag, the yellow in the flag being more orange hued in the 17th and 18th centuries.

It serves as basketball's most complete library, in addition to promoting and preserving the history of basketball. Dedicated to Canadian- American physician and inventor of the sport James Naismith, who invented the sport in Springfield, the Hall of Fame was opened and inducted its first class in 1959. As of the induction of the Class of 2019, the Hall has formally inducted 401 basketball individuals. __The 2020 class will feature 9 new members including, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Eddie Sutton, Rudy Tomjanovich, Tamika Catchings, Kim Mulkey, Barbara Stevens, and Patrick Baumann. Naismith memorial basketball hall of fame class of 2020 announcement presented by fifty-five south ventures. (2020, Apr 06). M2 Presswire History of the Springfield building The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was established in 1959 without a physical location by Lee Williams, a former athletic director at Colby College. In the 1960s, the Basketball Hall of Fame struggled to raise enough money for the construction of its first facility. However, during the following half-decade the necessary amount was raised, and the building opened on Feb. 17, 1968, less than one month after the National Basketball Association played its 18th All-Star Game. The Basketball Hall of Fame's Board named four inductees in its first year. In addition to honoring those who contributed to basketball, the Hall of Fame sought to make contributions of its own. In 1979, the Hall of Fame sponsored the Tip-Off Classic, a pre-season college basketball exhibition. This Tip-Off Classic has been the start to the college basketball season ever since, and although it does not always take place in Springfield, Massachusetts, generally it returns every few years. In the 17 years that the original Basketball Hall of Fame operated at Springfield College, it drew more than 630,000 visitors. The popularity of the Basketball Hall of Fame necessitated that a new facility be constructed, and in 1985, an $11 million facility was built beside the scenic Connecticut River in Springfield. As the new hall opened, it also recognized women for the first time, with inductees such as Senda Berenson Abbott, who first introduced basketball to women at Smith College. During the years following its construction, the Basketball Hall of Fame's second facility drew far more visitors than ever anticipated, due in large part to the increasing popularity of the game but also to the scenic location beside the river and the second Hall's interesting modern architecture. In 2002, the Basketball Hall of Fame moved again‚Äîalbeit merely 100 yards south along Springfield's riverfront‚Äîinto a $47 million facility designed by renowned architects Gwathmey Siegel & Associates. The building's architecture features a metallic silver, basketball-shaped sphere flanked by two similarly symmetrical rhombuses. The dome is illuminated at night and features 80,000 square foot (7,400 m¬≤), including a Subway sandwich shop, and an extensive gift shop. The second Basketball Hall of Fame was not torn down; rather it was converted into an LA Fitness health club. The current Basketball Hall of Fame features Center Court, a full-sized basketball court on which visitors can play. Inside the building there are a game gallery, many interactive exhibits, several theaters, and an honor ring of inductees. A large theater for ceremonies seats up to 300. The honorees inducted in 2002 included the Harlem Globetrotters and Magic Johnson, a five-time NBA champion, three-time NBA finals MVP and Olympic gold medalist. As of 2011, the current Basketball Hall of Fame has greatly exceeded attendance expectations, with basketball fans traveling to the Hall of Fame from all over the world. Despite the new facility's success, a logistical problem remains for the Basketball Hall of Fame and the City of Springfield. The two entities (including the entire riverfront area) are wholly separated by the Interstate 91 elevated highway‚Äîone of the eastern United States' busiest highways‚Äîwhich, essentially, inhibits foot-traffic and other interaction between the Basketball Hall of Fame and Springfield's increasingly lively Metro Center. Both the Hall and Springfield have made public statements about cooperating further so as to facilitate even more business and recreational growth for both; however the placement and height of Interstate 91 remains a physical obstacle. Urban planners at universities such as UMass Amherst have called for the I-91 to be moved, or to be re-configured so as to be pedestrian-friendly to Hall of Fame visitors. In 2015 however, the first major construction project on I-91 in 45 years began with no major alterations made to its location, although an additional exit was constructed to provide better access to downtown and the new MGM Springfield complex and provide easier access to the riverfront and Hall of Fame. In 2010, the Urban Land Institute announced a plan to make the walk between Springfield's Metro Center and the Hall of Fame (and riverfront) easier. This project was completed soon after the renovation of I-91 in the summer of 2019. thumbright200pxA basketball sculpture soars into the sky above the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. Criteria for induction In contrast to the Soccer and the National Baseball Halls of Fame, Springfield honors international and American professionals, as well as American and international amateurs, making it arguably the most comprehensive Hall of Fame among major American sports. From 2011 to 2015 seven committees were, and as of 2016 six committees are employed to both screen and elect candidates. Four of the committees screen prospective candidates: * North American Screening Committee (9 members) * Women's Screening Committee (7 members) * International Screening Committee (7 members) * Veterans Screening Committee (7 members), with \\"Veterans\\" defined as individuals whose careers ended at least 35 years before they are considered for election. Since 2011, the Veterans and International Committees also vote to directly induct one candidate for each induction class. Three committees were formed in 2011 to directly elect one candidate for each induction class: * American Basketball Association Committee - This committee was permanently disbanded in 2015 because it had fulfilled its purpose over the previous five years. * Contributor Direct Election Committee  Other committees may choose to elect contributors. For example, the 2014 class included two contributors. * Early African-American Pioneers of the Game Committee Individuals who receive at least seven votes from the North American Screening Committee or five votes from one of the other screening committees in a given year are eligible to advance to an Honors Committee, composed of 12 members plus rotating groups of 12 specialists (one group for female candidates, one group for international candidates, and one group for American and veterans candidates) who vote on each candidate. Each screening committee has a limited number of candidates it may submit to the Honors Committee‚Äî10 from the North American Committee, and two from each of the other committees. Any individual receiving at least 18 affirmative votes (75% of all votes cast) from the Honors Committee is approved for induction into the Hall of Fame. As long as the number of candidates receiving sufficient votes from a screening committee is not greater than the number of finalists that the committee is permitted to submit, advancement to the Honors Committee is generally pro forma, although the Hall's Board of Trustees may remove from consideration any candidate who \\"has damaged the integrity of the game of basketball\\". To be considered for induction by a screening committee, a player, retired coach, or referee must be fully retired from that role for at least three full seasons. The waiting period had originally been five years, but was changed to four years in December 2015, and to three seasons in December 2017. Prior to the induction class of 2018, referees had been eligible for induction after 25 years of full-time service, even if still active. Changes to the criteria for consideration of active coaches were also announced as part of the 2017 changes. Currently, coaches become eligible upon 25 years of full-time service at the high school level or above, or three seasons after retirement. Effective with the class of 2020, active coaches must meet the years of service requirement and be at least 60 years old. No years of service criterion is required for those who have made a \\"significant contribution to the game of basketball\\". Sportswriters and commentators are elected as full- fledged members, in contrast to the Baseball Hall of Fame that places them in separate wings from the \\"real\\" Hall of Fame. =Controversy= Controversy has arisen over aspects of the Hall's voting procedures, including voter anonymity. While sportswriter voters of other major sports' Halls of Fame openly debate their choices, the Naismith Hall process is not transparent. The Hall has also been criticized for a tendency to enshrine active collegiate coaches and relatively obscure players while omitting some accomplished players and coaches. The Hall has received backlash for excluding such players and coaches, like coach Eddie Sutton, who was the head coach for the Oklahoma State University men's basketball. Sutton is one of only 8 people to win 800 or more games as an NCAA Division 1 men's basketball head coach, but has yet to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Sutton is set to be inducted with the 2020 class, but 3 other coaches that have a similar track record to his and are still coaching have already been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The Basketball Hall of Fame is very independent of its baseball and football counterparts, specifically for its induction and voting process. There are multiple different voting committees for the Basketball Hall: the International Committee, North American Committee, Women‚Äôs Committee, Contributor Direct Election Committee, Early African-American Pioneers Committee, and Veterans Committee. Each committee makes their own individual selections for their inductees into the Hall. The members of these committees serve 3-year terms. How these members get selected, and who they are, is virtually unknown to the public and is kept completely anonymous. Inductees do not know who inducted them, and those who inducted them supposedly never let them know. This is a major reason why the Basketball Hall receives so much backlash because other Halls‚Äô selection committees consist of sportswriters who openly debate and acknowledge their selections for induction.Washburn, Gary. \\"Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Voting a Secret Society.\\" Boston Globe (Online), Sep 05, 2019. According to Mark Purdy, a sportswriter and selection committee member for the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Basketball Hall of Fame‚Äôs selection process is quite non-exclusive. He argues that the Baseball Hall of Fame first started inducting individuals in 1936, and Basketball didn‚Äôt start inducting players until 1959, but the Basketball Hall currently has more members than the Baseball Hall.Purdy, Mark. \\"Purdy: The Non-Exclusive Hall of Fame.\\" Oakland Tribune, Apr 08, 2014. Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame President and CEO, John Doleva, defends the exclusivity argument: ‚ÄúI'm used to explaining it and it's different than football and baseball,\\" Doleva said. ‚ÄúBecause football and baseball cover the men's game professionally, end of story. Naismith invented this game for everyone: men, women, high school college, pro, coaches, players. We really represent the entire game, so we have a broader class.‚Äù Inductees The entrance to the former site of the Basketball Hall of Fame near Metro Center Springfield.

Other Hall awards In conjunction with the Final Four of each year's NCAA Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments, the Naismith Hall gives out several awards to college basketball athletes: For men, the Hall presents awards to the top players in Division I at each of the five standard basketball positions. * The Bob Cousy Award, presented since 2004 to the top point guard. The award was originally open to players in all three NCAA divisions (I, II, and III), but is now restricted to D-I players. * The Jerry West Award, presented since 2015 to the top shooting guard. * The Julius Erving Award, presented since 2015 to the top small forward. * The Karl Malone Award, presented since 2015 to the top power forward. * The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, presented since 2015 to the top center. Each of the award winners is chosen by a Hall of Fame selection committee, plus the award's namesake. The Hall, in cooperation with the Women's Basketball Coaches Association, presents analogous awards for the top Division I women's players at each position. One has been awarded since 2000; the others were first presented in 2018. * The Nancy Lieberman Award for the top point guard was the Hall's only women's positional award that was presented before 2018, having first been awarded in 2000. * The Ann Meyers Drysdale Award, first presented in 2018 to the top shooting guard. * The Cheryl Miller Award, first presented in 2018 to the top small forward. * The Katrina McClain Award, first presented in 2018 to the top power forward. * The Lisa Leslie Award, first presented in 2018 to the top center. As with the men's awards, the selection committee for the women's awards includes each award's namesake. The Hall also formerly presented the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award to two college seniors‚Äîone male player no taller than , and one female player no taller than ‚Äîdetermined to have been the nation's best student-athletes. The men's award, given since 1969, was voted on by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and the women's, given since 1984, by members of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association. Both awards were discontinued after the 2012‚Äì13 season.

However, there is a substantial amount of overlap between the practice of law and various other professions where clients are represented by agents. These professions include real estate, banking, accounting, and insurance. Moreover, a growing number of legal document assistants (LDAs) are offering services which have traditionally been offered only by lawyers and their employee paralegals. Many documents may now be created by computer-assisted drafting libraries, where the clients are asked a series of questions that are posed by the software in order to construct the legal documents. In addition, regulatory consulting firms also provide advisory services on regulatory compliance that were traditionally provided exclusively by law firms. United States In the United States, the practice of law is conditioned upon admission to practice of law, and specifically admission to the bar of a particular state or other territorial jurisdiction. The American Bar Association and the American Law Institute are among the organizations that are concerned with the interests of lawyers as a profession and the promulgation of uniform standards of professionalism and ethics, but regulation of the practice of law is left to the individual states, and their definitions vary. =Unauthorized practice of law= \\"Unauthorized practice of law\\" (UPL) is an act sometimes prohibited by statute, regulation, or court rules. Definition The definition of \\"unauthorized practice of law\\" is variable, and is often conclusory and tautological, i.e., it is the doing of a lawyer's or counselor's work by a non-lawyer for money. There is some agreement that appearing in a legally constituted court in a legal proceeding to represent clients (particularly for a fee) is considered to be unauthorized practice of law. But other variations are subject to interpretation and conflicting regulation, particularly as to the scope and breadth of the prohibition. Black's Law Dictionary defines unauthorized practice of law as \\"The practice of law by a person, typically a nonlawyer, who has not been licensed or admitted to practice law in a given jurisdiction.\\" The Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers notes: > The definitions and tests employed by courts to delineate unauthorized > practice by non-lawyers have been vague or conclusory, while jurisdictions > have differed significantly in describing what constitutes unauthorized > practice in particular areas. > Certain activities, such as the representation of another person in > litigation, are generally proscribed. Even in that area, many jurisdictions > recognize exceptions for such matters as small-claims and landlord-tenant > tribunals and certain proceedings in administrative agencies. Moreover, many > jurisdictions have authorized law students and others not locally admitted > to represent indigent persons or others as part of clinical legal education > programs. . . . What is more controversial is out-of-court activities, particularly drafting of documents and giving advice, and whether that is considered to be unauthorized practice of law. Some states have defined the \\"practice of law\\" to include those who appear as a representative in arbitration or act as arbitrators in disputes. For example, there is a growing conflict between the multijurisdictional practice of law in arbitration proceedings in the financial service industry and state regulation of lawyers. With a few exceptions, the general rule is that an appearance at an arbitration does not constitute the practice of law. . The United States bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of Tennessee has held that \\"providing clients with explanations or definitions of such legal terms of art ... is, by itself, giving legal advice.\\" The North Carolina State Bar has held that \\"definition of lien law terms, warnings regarding time requirements, and reminders about sending out preliminary notices within five to ten days of beginning work, when combined with its preparation of legal documents [in the manner described], constitute providing legal advice.\\"North Carolina State Bar v. Lienguard, Inc., 2014 NCBC 11 Texas law generally prohibits a person who is not an attorney from representing a client in a personal injury or property damage matter, and punishes a violation as a misdemeanor.Tex. Gov‚Äôt Code sec. 38.123. Chapter 38 of the penal code, containing 38.122 and 38.123 Some states also criminalize the separate behavior of falsely claiming to be lawyer (in Texas, for example, this is a felony).Tex. Gov‚Äôt Code sec. 38.122 Enforcement Criminal laws and enforcement of \\"Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)\\" statutes is the organized bar's preferred method. In Florida, the unauthorized practice of law is a third degree felony,¬ß454.23 Fla. Stat. (2016)(\\"Any person not licensed or otherwise authorized to practice law in this state who practices law in this state or holds himself or herself out to the public as qualified to practice law in this state ... commits a felony of the third degree.\\" which is punishable by up to six months in prison¬ß775.082(3)(e) Fla. Stat.(2016) and $5000 in fines.¬ß775.083(1)(c) Fla. Stat. (2016) New Jersey has a law which makes it a ‚Äúdisorderly persons offense‚Äù to knowingly to engage in the unauthorized practice of law, and a ‚Äúcrime in the fourth degree‚Äù to commit UPL if one (a) creates a false impression that one is a lawyer; (b) derives a benefit from UPL, or (c) causes an injury by UPL. In a 2015 survey by the American Bar Association, Florida had the largest budget‚Äî$1.8 million‚Äînationwide for prosecuting the unauthorized practice of law. Despite the state's interest in protecting the public and so-called \\"learned professions\\" from having unschooled persons practising them, and the state's insistence on enforcing a monopoly, the existence of laws governing (or defining) \\"unauthorized practice of Law\\" does not, ipso facto mean that they will be enforced. History and future The American Bar Association proposed model rules regarding the unauthorized practice of law, which Judge Richard Posner characterized as an attempt to perpetuate a monopoly to the disadvantage of consumers. The judge observed that the legal profession is ‚Äúa cartel of providers of services relating to society‚Äôs laws‚Äù which cartel's focus is to restrict entry. \\"Modern economists call it 'rent seeking', but throughout recorded history, skilled crafts and professions have tried to raise their members‚Äô incomes by using the power of the state to limit entry.\\" The practice of law was not formally regulated in Arizona for a time. However, the Arizona Supreme Court found independent inherent authority to regulate the practice of law.In re Creasy, 198 Ariz. 539 (2000). See generally Jonathan Rose, \\"Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arizona: A Legal and Political Problem That Won't Go Away\\", 34 Ariz. St. L.J. 585. Arizona's statute criminalizing unauthorized practice of law was allowed to lapse from a sunset law in 1985. Rose suggests that legislative proposals to recriminalize the unauthorized practice of law have heretofore failed because of anti-lawyer sentiment in Arizona politics.Id. at 593. Moreover, Rose asserts that resentment lingers from an unpopular interpretation of the old statute in State Bar v. Arizona Land Title & Trust Co., 90 Ariz. 76 (1961). This ruling imposed sanctions on a title and realty company engaged in drafting contracts. Rose says, \\"Throughout the country, various jurisdictions have developed numerous tests for defining the practice of law. But none is broader nor more all-encompassing than that articulated in Arizona Title.\\"Rose at 588. Attorney participation In the United States, the rules of professional conduct generally prohibit an attorney from assisting a non- attorney from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. An attorney therefore may not partner with or split fees with a non-attorney in the performance of any sort of legal work. Furthermore, an attorney may not employ a disbarred or suspended attorney in a legal practice where former clients of the disbarred or suspended attorney will be represented. Singapore =Unauthorized practice of law= In Singapore, it is a criminal offence if an unauthorised person carries out any act that may be performed only by a qualified lawyer or if he/she pretends to be a qualified lawyer. The relevant provision is section 33 of the Legal Profession Act. The acts that may be performed only by a qualified lawyer are set out in section 33 of the Legal Profession Act and case law.

Fleas live by consuming blood, or hematophagy, from their hosts. Adult fleas grow to about long, are usually brown, and have bodies that are \\"flattened\\" sideways or narrow, enabling them to move through their host's fur or feathers. They lack wings, but have strong claws preventing them from being dislodged, mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood, and hind legs extremely well adapted for jumping. They are able to leap a distance of some 50 times their body length, a feat second only to jumps made by another group of insects, the superfamily of froghoppers. Flea larvae are worm-like with no limbs; they have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic debris left on their host's skin. The Siphonaptera are most closely related to the snow scorpionflies (known as snow fleas in the UK) in the family Boreidae, placing them within the Endopterygote insect order Mecoptera. Fleas arose in the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, before moving on to other groups, including birds. Each species of flea is more or less a specialist with respect to its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group; for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread to humans by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by infected fleas. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian, c. 540 and the Black Death, c. 1350, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population. Fleas appear in human culture in such diverse forms as flea circuses, poems like John Donne's erotic The Flea, works of music such as by Modest Mussorgsky, and a film by Charlie Chaplin.  Morphology and behavior  Fleas are wingless insects, long, that are agile, usually dark colored (for example, the reddish-brown of the cat flea), with a proboscis, or stylet, adapted to feeding by piercing the skin and sucking their host's blood through their epipharynx. Flea legs end in strong claws that are adapted to grasp a host. Unlike other insects, fleas do not possess compound eyes but instead only have simple eyespots with a single biconvex lens; some species lack eyes altogether. Their bodies are laterally compressed, permitting easy movement through the hairs or feathers on the host's body. The flea body is covered with hard plates called sclerites. These sclerites are covered with many hairs and short spines directed backward, which also assist its movements on the host. The tough body is able to withstand great pressure, likely an adaptation to survive attempts to eliminate them by scratching.Fleas. Koehler, P.G.; Oi, F.M. Printed July 1993, revised February 2003. Provided by the University of Florida Fleas lay tiny, white, oval eggs. The larvae are small and pale, have bristles covering their worm-like bodies, lack eyes, and have mouth parts adapted to chewing. The larvae feed on organic matter, especially the feces of mature fleas, which contain dried blood. Adults feed only on fresh blood. =Jumping= Their legs are long, the hind pair well adapted for jumping; a flea can jump vertically up to and horizontally up to , making the flea one of the best jumpers of all known animals (relative to body size), second only to the froghopper. The flea jump is so rapid and forceful that it exceeds the capabilities of muscle, and instead of relying on direct muscle power, fleas store muscle energy in a pad of the elastic protein named resilin before releasing it rapidly (like a human using a bow and arrow). Immediately before the jump, muscles contract and deform the resilin pad, slowly storing energy which can then be released extremely rapidly to power leg extension for propulsion. To prevent premature release of energy or motions of the leg, the flea employs a \\"catch mechanism\\". Early in the jump, the tendon of the primary jumping muscle passes slightly behind the coxa-trochanter joint, generating a torque which holds the joint closed with the leg close to the body. To trigger jumping, another muscle pulls the tendon forward until it passes the joint axis, generating the opposite torque to extend the leg and power the jump by release of stored energy. The actual take off has been shown by high-speed video to be from the tibiae and tarsi rather than from the trochantera (knees).  Life cycle and development  Dog flea (from top) larva, egg, pupa and adult Fleas are holometabolous insects, going through the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and the dissolution of the testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults. = Egg = The number of eggs laid depends on species, with batch sizes ranging from two to several dozen. The total number of eggs produced in a female's lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several thousand. In some species, the flea lives in the host's nest or burrow and the eggs are deposited on the substrate, but in others, the eggs are laid on the host itself and can easily fall off onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps become one of the primary habitats of eggs and developing larvae. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Experiments have shown that fleas lay more eggs on hosts which have limited food intakes, and that eggs and larvae survive better under these conditions, perhaps because the host's immune system is compromised. = Larva = Flea larva Flea larvae emerge from the eggs to feed on any available organic material such as dead insects, faeces, conspecific eggs, and vegetable matter. In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae to mature. Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping to dark, humid places such as sand or soil, cracks and crevices, under carpets and in bedding. The entire larval stage lasts between four and 18 days. = Pupa = Given an adequate supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages. Within the cocoon, the larva molts for a final time and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. This can take just four days, but may take much longer under adverse conditions, and there follows a variable- length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits a suitable opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and increased levels of carbon dioxide, all of which stimuli may indicate the presence of a suitable host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas may be present in otherwise flea-free environments, and the introduction of a suitable host may trigger a mass emergence. = Adult = Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, permitting rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live for up to a year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C (70 ¬∞F to 85 ¬∞F) and optimum humidity is 70%. Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, can detect the changing levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate it is getting close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make their way back to the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  The snow scorpionflies (Boreidae) are the sister clade to the Siphonaptera. Between 1735 and 1758, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first classified insects, doing so on the basis of their wing structure. One of the seven orders into which he divided them was \\"Aptera\\", meaning wingless, a group in which as well as fleas, he included spiders, woodlice and myriapods. It wasn't until 1810 that the French zoologist Pierre Andr√© Latreille reclassified the insects on the basis of their mouthparts as well as their wings, splitting Aptera into Thysanura (silverfish), Anoplura (sucking lice) and Siphonaptera (fleas), at the same time separating off the arachnids and crustaceans into their own subphyla. The group's name, Siphonaptera, is zoological Latin from the Greek siphon (a tube) and aptera (wingless). Fleas are related to the Diptera (true flies) and the Mecoptera (scorpion flies) as shown in the cladogram, based on a 2008 analysis of four loci (18S and 28S ribosomal DNA, cytochrome oxidase II, and elongation factor 1-alpha) for 128 flea taxa from around the world. The Boreidae (snow scorpionflies) are the sister clade to the Siphonaptera. ::: Amphies. = Amphiesmenoptera Cenozoic flea in amber, c. 20 mya, is morphologically modern. Fossils of wingless \\"pre-fleas\\" with siphonate (sucking) mouthparts from the middle Jurassic to early Cretaceous have been found in northeastern China. These belonged to three proposed extinct families, the Pseudopulicidae, the Saurophthiridae, and the Tarwiniidae. The last common ancestor of modern Siphonaptera separated from the Mecoptera during the early Cretaceous. Most flea families formed after the end of the Cretaceous (in the Paleogene and onwards). Fleas probably arose in the southern continental area of Gondwana, and migrated rapidly northwards from there. They most likely evolved with mammal hosts, only later moving to birds. Jigger, Tunga penetrans, in human skin Siphonaptera is a relatively small order of insects: members of the order undergo complete metamorphosis and are secondarily wingless (their ancestors had wings which modern forms have lost). In 2005, Medvedev listed 2005 species in 242 genera, and despite subsequent descriptions of new species, bringing the total up to around 2500 species, this is the most complete database available. The order is divided into four infraorders and eighteen families. Some families are exclusive to a single host group; these include the Malacopsyllidae (armadillos), Ischnopsyllidae (bats) and Chimaeropsyllidae (elephant shrews). Many of the known species are little studied. Some 600 species (a quarter of the total) are known from a single record from a single host. Over 94% of species are associated with mammalian hosts, and only about 3% of species can be considered to be specific parasites of birds. The fleas on birds are thought to have originated from mammalian fleas; at least sixteen separate groups of fleas switched to avian hosts during the evolutionary history of the Siphonaptera. Occurrences of fleas on reptiles is accidental, and fleas have been known to feed on the hemolymph (bloodlike body fluid) of ticks. Flea phylogeny was long neglected, the discovery of homologies with the parts of other insects being made difficult by their extreme specialization. Whiting and colleagues prepared a detailed molecular phylogeny in 2008, with the basic structure shown in the cladogram. The Hectopsyllidae, including the harmful chigoe flea or jigger, is sister to the rest of the Siphonaptera.  Relationship with host  Flea bites in humans. Fleas feed on a wide variety of warm-blooded vertebrates including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites. Although there are dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis Curtis, 1826), and cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) fleas are not strictly species-specific. A study in Virginia examined fleas collected from 29 dogs. In total, 244 fleas were identified and all turned out to be cat fleas. In fact, dog fleas haven't been found in Virginia in more than 70 years, so it is very likely that a flea found on a dog is actually a cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis). In fact, dog fleas may not even occur in the US. One theory of human hairlessness is that the loss of hair helped humans to reduce their burden of fleas and other ectoparasites. = Direct effects of bites = Human foot infested with jigger fleas, Tunga penetrans In many species, fleas are principally a nuisance to their hosts, causing an itching sensation which in turn causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen, irritating nodule to form on the epidermis at the site of each bite, with a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. This can lead to an eczematous itchy skin disease called flea allergy dermatitis, which is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to secondary hair loss as a result of frequent scratching and biting by the animal. They can also cause anemia in extreme cases. = As a vector = Fleas are vectors for viral, bacterial and rickettsial diseases of humans and other animals, as well as of protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.  Relationship with humans  =In literature and art= Robert Hooke's drawing of a flea in Micrographia, 1665 Fleas have appeared in poetry, literature, music and art; these include Robert Hooke's drawing of a flea under the microscope in his pioneering book Micrographia published in 1665, poems by Donne and Jonathan Swift, works of music by Giorgio Federico Ghedini and Modest Mussorgsky, a play by Georges Feydeau, a film by Charlie Chaplin, and paintings by artists such as Giuseppe Crespi, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, and Georges de La Tour. See also the 2009 version. Development of the flea from egg to adult. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, c. 1680 John Donne's erotic metaphysical poem \\"The Flea\\", published in 1633 after his death, uses the conceit of a flea, which has sucked blood from the male speaker and his female lover, as an extended metaphor for their sexual relationship. The speaker tries to convince a lady to sleep with him, arguing that if the mingling of their blood in the flea is innocent, then sex would be also. The comic poem Siphonaptera was written in 1915 by the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, It describes an infinite chain of parasitism made of ever larger and ever smaller fleas. =Flea circuses= A flea circus: \\"The Go-As-You-Please Race, as seen through a Magnifying Glass\\", engraved by J. G. Francis, from an article by C. F. Holder in St. Nicholas Magazine, 1886 Flea circuses provided entertainment to nineteenth century audiences. These circuses, extremely popular in Europe from 1830 onwards, featured fleas dressed as humans or towing miniature carts, chariots, rollers or cannon. These devices were originally made by watchmakers or jewellers to show off their skill at miniaturization. A ringmaster called a \\"professor\\" accompanied their performance with a rapid circus patter. =Carriers of plague= The Great Plague of London, in 1665, killed up to 100,000 people. Oriental rat fleas, Xenopsylla cheopis, can carry the coccobacillus Yersinia pestis. The infected fleas feed on rodent vectors of this bacterium, such as the black rat, Rattus rattus, and then infect human populations with the plague, as has happened repeatedly from ancient times, as in the Plague of Justinian in 541‚Äì542. Outbreaks killed up to 200 million people across Europe between 1346 and 1671. The Black Death pandemic between 1346 and 1353 likely killed over a third of the population of Europe. Because fleas carry plague, they have seen service as a biological weapon. During World War II, the Japanese army dropped fleas infested with Y. pestis in China. The bubonic and septicaemic plagues are the most probable form of the plague that would spread as a result of a bioterrorism attack that used fleas as a vector. =The Rothschild Collection= The banker Charles Rothschild devoted much of his time to entomology, creating a large collection of fleas now in the Rothschild Collection at the Natural History Museum, London. He discovered and named the plague vector flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, also known as the oriental rat flea, in 1903. Using what was probably the world's most complete collection of fleas of about 260,000 specimens (representing some 73% of the 2,587 species and subspecies so far described), he described around 500 species and subspecies of Siphonaptera. He was followed in this interest by his daughter Miriam Rothschild, who helped to catalogue his enormous collection of the insects in seven volumes. = Flea treatments = Fleas have a significant economic impact. In America alone, approximately $2.8 billion is spent annually on flea-related veterinary bills and another $1.6 billion annually for flea treatment with pet groomers. Four billion dollars is spent annually for prescription flea treatment and $348 million for flea pest control.

Terminology Most of these states have historically been a polity, but in some occasions were rather territories in respect of which a princely title is held. The prince's estate and wealth may be located mainly or wholly outside the geographical confines of the principality. Generally recognised surviving sovereign principalities are Liechtenstein, Monaco, and the co-principality of Andorra. Extant royal primogenitures styled as principalities include Asturias (Spain). The Principality of Wales existed in the northern and western areas of Wales between the 13th and 16th centuries; the Laws in Wales Act of 1536 which legally incorporated Wales within England removed the distinction between those areas and the March of Wales, but no principality covering the whole of Wales was created. Since that time, the title Prince of Wales has traditionally been granted to the heir apparent to the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, but it confers no responsibilities for government in Wales. The Principality of Catalonia existed in the north-eastern areas of Spain between 14th and 18th centuries, as the term for the territories ruled by the Catalan courts, until the defeat of the Habsburgs in the Spanish succession war, when these institutions were abolished due to their support for the Habsburg pretender. Principality of Asturias is the official name of autonomous community of Asturias. The term principality is also sometimes used generically for any small monarchy, especially for small sovereign states ruled by a monarch of a lesser rank than a king, such as a F√ºrst (usually translated in English as \\"prince\\"), as in Liechtenstein, or a Grand Duke. No sovereign duchy currently exists, but Luxembourg is a surviving example of a sovereign grand duchy. Historically there have been sovereign principalities with many styles of ruler, such as Countship, Margraviate and even Lordship, especially within the Holy Roman Empire. While the preceding definition would seem to fit a princely state perfectly, the European historical tradition is to reserve that word for native monarchies in colonial countries, and to apply \\"principality\\" to the Western monarchies. European =Development= Though principalities existed in antiquity, even before the height of the Roman Empire, the principality as it is known today developed in the Middle Ages between 750 and 1450 when feudalism was the primary economic and social system in much of Europe. Feudalism increased the power of local princes within a king's lands. As princes continued to gain more power over time, the authority of the king was diminished in many places. This led to political fragmentation as the king's lands were broken into mini-states ruled by princes and dukes who wielded absolute power over their small territories. This was especially prevalent in Europe, and particularly with the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. During the Late Middle Ages from 1200 to 1500, principalities were often at war with each other as royal houses asserted sovereignty over smaller principalities. These wars caused a great deal of instability and economies were destroyed. Episodes of bubonic plague also reduced the power of principalities to survive independently. Eventually, agricultural progress and development of new trade goods and services boosted commerce between principalities. Many of these states became wealthy, expanded their territories and improved the services provided to their citizens. Princes and dukes developed their lands, established new ports and chartered large thriving cities. Some used their new-found wealth to build palaces and other institutions now associated with sovereign states. =Consolidation= Johann I Josef, last prince of Liechtenstein prior to the end of the Holy Roman Empire While some principalities prospered in their independence, less successful states were swallowed by stronger royal houses. Europe saw consolidation of small principalities into larger kingdoms and empires. This had already happened in England in the first millennium, and this trend subsequently led to the creation of such states as France, Portugal, and Spain. Another form of consolidation was orchestrated in Italy during the Renaissance by the Medici family. A banking family from Florence, the Medici took control of governments in various Italian regions and even assumed the papacy. They then appointed family members as princes and assured their protection. Prussia also later expanded by acquiring the territories of many other states. However, in the 17th to 19th centuries, especially within the Holy Roman Empire, the reverse was also occurring: many new small sovereign states arose as a result of transfers of land for various reasons. Notable principalities existed until the early 20th century in various regions of Germany and Italy. =Nationalism= Nationalism, the belief that the nation- state is the best vehicle to realise the aspirations of a people, became popular in the late 19th century. A characteristic of nationalism is an identity with a larger region such as an area sharing a common language and culture. With this development, principalities fell out of favour. As a compromise, many principalities united with neighbouring regions and adopted constitutional forms of government, with the monarch acting as a mere figurehead while administration was left in the hands of elected parliaments. The trend in the 19th and 20th centuries was the abolition of various forms of monarchy and the creation of republican governments led by popularly elected presidents. =Ecclesiastical principalities= Several principalities where genealogical inheritance is replaced by succession in a religious office have existed in the Roman Catholic Church, in each case consisting of a feudal polity (often a former secular principality in the broad sense) held ex officio ‚Äî the closest possible equivalent to hereditary succession ‚Äî by a Prince of the church, styled more precisely according to his ecclesiastical rank, such as Prince-bishop, Prince-abbot or, especially as a form of crusader state, Grand Master. Some of these instances were merely religious offices without sovereign power over any territory, while others, such as Salzburg and Durham, shared some of the characteristics of secular princes. Asia Prior to the European colonialism, South Asia and South East Asia were under the influence of Indosphere of greater India, where numerous Indianized principalities and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. The influence of Indian culture into these areas was given the term indianization. George Coedes defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, Hinduism and Buddhism and the Sanskrit dialect. This can be seen in the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism. Indian honorifics also influenced the Malay, Thai, Filipino and Indonesian honorifics.Krishna Chandra Sagar, 2002, An Era of Peace, Page 52. In the colonial context, the term princely states was used, especially for those that came under the sway of a European colonising power: for example the British Indian and neighbouring or associated (e.g., Arabian) princely states were ruled by monarchs called Princes by the British, regardless of the native styles, which could be equivalent to royal or even imperial rank in the Indigenous cultures. Other principalities =Other= Principalities have also existed in ancient and modern civilizations of Africa, Pre-Columbian America and Oceania. =Micronational principalities= Several micronations, which de facto have few characteristics of sovereign states and are not recognized as such, more or less seriously claim the status of sovereign principalities. Examples are Sealand, a former military fort in the North Sea; Seborga, internationally considered a small town in Italy; and Hutt River and Principality of Wy in Mosman, internationally considered to be in Australia.

Brown, who said that speeches, sermons, and petitions were accomplishing nothing, that \\"moral suasion is hopeless\\", saw violence as unfortunately necessary if slavery in the United States were to be eliminated. An intensely religious man who at one point studied for the ministry, and who effortlessly quoted the Bible from memory in his speeches (see John Brown's last speech), Brown felt that this was the work God had called him to do. He said repeatedly that he was following the Golden Rule. He first gained national attention when he led small groups of anti-slavery volunteers during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of the late 1850s. He was dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolitionist movement: \\"These men are all talk. What we need is action‚Äîaction!\\" In May 1856, Brown and his supporters killed five supporters of slavery in the Pottawatomie massacre, a response to the sacking of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces. Brown then commanded anti-slavery forces at the Battle of Black Jack (June 2) and the Battle of Osawatomie (August 30, 1856). As Brown's son John Brown, Jr. told a visitor just before the raid on Harpers Ferry, \\"as only force and fire-arms kept slavery out a Kansas, so nothing else will overthrow it in the Southern States\\", the visitor adding that this was a belief \\"daily gaining adherents\\". In October 1859, Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (today West Virginia), intending to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south through the mountainous regions of Virginia and North Carolina; he had prepared a Provisional Constitution for the revised, slavery-free United States he hoped to create. He seized the armory, but seven people were killed, and ten or more were injured. Brown intended to arm slaves with weapons from the armory, but very few slaves joined his revolt. Within 36 hours, those of Brown's men who had not fled were killed or captured by local farmers, militiamen, and U.S. Marines, the latter led by Robert E. Lee. Brown was hastily tried for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, the murder of five men, and inciting a slave insurrection; he was found guilty on all counts and was hanged. He was the first person executed for treason in the history of the United States. Historians agree that the Harpers Ferry raid and Brown's trial (Virginia v. John Brown), both covered extensively by the national press, escalated tensions that led a year later to the South's secession and the American Civil War. Brown's raid captured the nation's attention; Southerners feared that it was just the first of many Northern plots to cause a slave rebellion that might endanger their lives. On the Union side, soldiers marched to the new song \\"John Brown's Body\\", that portrayed him as a heroic martyr whose \\"truth is marching on\\". Brown's actions as an abolitionist and the tactics he used make him a controversial figure even today. He is both memorialized as a heroic martyr and visionary, compared sometimes with Moses or Christ, and vilified as a madman and a terrorist.Ken Chowder. \\"The Father of American Terrorism \\". American Heritage. February/March 2000. Early life The John Brown Tannery Site, a historic archaeological site which includes the remains of Brown's tannery in Pennsylvania John Brown was born May 9, 1800, in Torrington, Connecticut. He was the fourth of the eight children of Owen Brown (1771‚Äì1856) and Ruth Mills (1772‚Äì1808) and grandson of Capt. John Brown (1728‚Äì1776).There has been speculation that the grandfather was the same John Brown who was a Loyalist during the American Revolution and spent time in jail with the notorious Claudius Smith, allegedly for stealing cattle, which he and Smith used to feed starving British troops. But this runs against the grain of the Brown family history as well as the record of the Humphrey family, to which the Browns were directly related (abolitionist John Brown's maternal grandmother was a Humphrey). Brown himself wrote in his 1857 autobiographical letter that both his and his first wife's grandfathers were soldiers in the Continental Army [which he established in his The Humphreys Family in America (1883)], which notes that abolitionist John Brown's grandfather, Capt. John Brown (born 1728), was a militia captain who died early in the American Revolution. His son Owen Brown, the father of abolitionist John Brown, was a tanner and strict evangelical who hated slavery and taught his trade to his son. Brown could trace his ancestry back to 17th-century English Puritans. In 1805, the family moved to Hudson, Ohio, where Owen Brown opened a tannery; there is a historical marker at the site of their house. Hudson was a center of anti-slavery activity and debate, and Owen participated fully, offering a safe house to Underground Railroad fugitives. There not being a high school in Hudson at that time, John studied at the school of the abolitionist Elizur Wright, father of the famous Elizur Wright, in nearby Tallmadge. Owen was one of the founders of Hudson's school, the Western Reserve College and Preparatory School, which would soon (1832‚Äì33) become consumed with and torn apart by the issue of slavery (see Beriah Green and Lane Rebels). Owen also became a supporter of the Oberlin Institute in its early stage, but was ultimately critical of the school's \\"Perfectionist\\" leanings, especially renowned in the preaching and teaching of Charles Finney and Asa Mahan. Brown withdrew his membership from the Congregational church in the 1840s and never officially joined another church, but both he and his father were fairly conventional evangelicals for the period with its focus on the pursuit of personal righteousness. Brown's personal religion is fairly well documented in the papers of the Reverend Clarence Gee, a Brown family expert, now held in the Hudson [Ohio] Library and Historical Society. Brown's father had as an apprentice Jesse R. Grant, father of Ulysses S. Grant.Ulysses S Grant, Memoirs and Selected Letters, (The Library of America, 1990) At 16, Brown left his family and went to Plainfield, Massachusetts, where he enrolled in a preparatory program. Shortly afterward, he transferred to the Morris Academy in Litchfield, Connecticut.John Brown profile , pabook.libraries.psu.edu; accessed August 29, 2015. He hoped to become a Congregational minister, but money ran out and he suffered from eye inflammations that forced him to give up the academy and return to Ohio. In Hudson, he worked briefly at his father's tannery before opening a successful tannery of his own outside of town with his adopted brother. In 1820, Brown married Dianthe Lusk. Their first child, John Jr, was born 13 months later. In 1825, seeking a safer location (for fugitive slaves), Brown and his family moved to New Richmond, Pennsylvania, where he bought of land. He cleared an eighth of it and built a cabin, a barn, and a tannery, the latter with a secret room to hide escaping slaves. The John Brown Tannery Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It \\"was a major stop on the [Underground] Railroad, marking its place in history from 1825 to 1835.\\" During that period, \\"Brown aided in the passing of an estimated 2,500 slaves.\\" Presumably, Brown was also helping a smaller number of fugitive slaves when he lived in the village of Hudson. Within a year, the tannery employed 15 men. Brown made money raising cattle and surveying. He helped to establish a post office and a school. During this period, Brown operated an interstate business involving cattle and leather production along with a kinsman, Seth Thompson, from eastern Ohio. In 1829, some white families asked Brown to help them drive off Native Americans who hunted annually in the area. Brown replied, \\"I will have nothing to do with so mean an act. I would sooner take my gun and help drive you out of the country.\\" Throughout his life, Brown maintained peaceful relations with his Native American neighbors, even accompanying them on hunting excursions and inviting them to eat in his home. In 1831, one of his sons died. Brown fell ill, and his businesses began to suffer, leaving him in terrible debt. In the summer of 1832, shortly after the death of a newborn son, his wife Dianthe died, leaving him with the children John Jr., Jason, Owen, and Ruth. (Another three of their children did not survive to adulthood.) On June 14, 1833, Brown married 16-year-old Mary Ann Day (1817‚Äì1884), originally from Washington County, New York. They eventually had 13 children; those alive at John Brown's death were Salmon, Annie, Sarah, and Ellen. In 1836, Brown moved his family to Franklin Mills, Ohio (now known as Kent). There he borrowed money to buy land in the area, building and operating a tannery along the Cuyahoga River in partnership with Zenas Kent. He suffered great financial losses in the economic crisis of 1839, which struck the Western states more severely than had the Panic of 1837. Following the heavy borrowing trends of Ohio, many businessmen like Brown trusted too heavily in credit and state bonds and paid dearly for it. In one episode of property loss, Brown was jailed when he attempted to retain ownership of a farm by occupying it against the claims of the new owner. Like other determined men of his time and background, he tried many different business efforts in an attempt to get out of debt. Along with tanning hides and cattle trading, he also undertook horse and sheep breeding, the last of which was to become a notable aspect of his pre-public vocation. In 1837, in response to the murder of Elijah P. Lovejoy, Brown publicly vowed: \\"Here, before God, in the presence of these witnesses, from this time, I consecrate my life to the destruction of slavery!\\" Brown was declared bankrupt by a federal court on September 28, 1842. In 1843, four of his children died of dysentery. As Louis DeCaro Jr shows in his biographical sketch (2007), from the mid-1840s Brown had built a reputation as an expert in fine sheep and wool, and entered into a partnership with Col. Simon Perkins of Akron, Ohio, whose flocks and farms were managed by Brown and sons. Brown eventually moved into a home with his family across the street from the Perkins Stone Mansion on Perkins Hill. The John Brown House (Akron, Ohio) still stands and is owned and operated by The Summit County Historical Society of Akron, Ohio. Transformative years in Springfield, Massachusetts In 1846, Brown and his business partner Simon Perkins moved to the ideologically progressive city of Springfield, Massachusetts. There Brown found a community whose white leadership‚Äîfrom the community's most prominent churches, to its wealthiest businessmen, to its most popular politicians, to its local jurists, and even to the publisher of one of the nation's most influential newspapers‚Äîwere deeply involved and emotionally invested in the anti-slavery movement. Brown's and Perkins' intent was to represent the interests of the Ohio's wool growers as opposed to those of New England's wool manufacturers‚Äîthus Brown and Perkins set up a wool commission operation. While in Springfield, Brown lived in a house at 51 Franklin Street.Franklin Sanborn. \\"John Brown in Massachusetts \\". The Atlantic Monthly. April 1872. Retrieved on October 16, 2012. Two years before Brown's arrival in Springfield, in 1844, the city's African-American abolitionists had founded the Sanford Street Free Church‚Äînow known as St. John's Congregational Church‚Äîwhich went on to become one of the United States' most prominent platforms for abolitionist speeches. From 1846 until he left Springfield in 1850, Brown was a parishioner at the Free Church, where he witnessed abolitionist lectures by the likes of Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. In 1847, after speaking at the Free Church, Douglass spent a night speaking with Brown, after which Douglass wrote, \\"From this night spent with John Brown in Springfield, Mass. 1847 while I continued to write and speak against slavery, I became all the same less hopeful for its peaceful abolition. My utterances became more and more tinged by the color of this man's strong impressions.\\" During Brown's time in Springfield, he became deeply involved in transforming the city into a major center of abolitionism, and one of the safest and most significant stops on the Underground Railroad. Brown also learned much about Massachusetts' mercantile elite; while he initially considered this knowledge a curse, it proved to be a boon to his later activities in Kansas and at Harpers Ferry. The business community had reacted with hesitation when Brown asked them to change their highly profitable practice of selling low-quality wool en masse at low prices. Initially, Brown na√Øvely trusted them, but he soon realized they were determined to maintain their control of price-setting. Also, on the outskirts of Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley's sheep farmers were largely unorganized and hesitant to change their methods of production to meet higher standards. In the Ohio Cultivator, Brown and other wool growers complained that the Connecticut River Valley's farmers' tendencies were lowering all U.S. wool prices abroad. In reaction, Brown made a last-ditch effort to overcome the wool mercantile elite by seeking an alliance with European manufacturers. Ultimately, Brown was disappointed to learn that Europe preferred to buy Western Massachusetts wools en masse at the cheap prices they had been getting. Brown then traveled to England to seek a higher price for Springfield's wool. The trip was a disaster, as the firm incurred a loss of $40,000, of which Perkins bore the brunt. With this misfortune, the Perkins and Brown wool commission operation closed in Springfield in late 1849. Subsequent lawsuits tied up the partners for several more years. An 1851 poster warning the \\"colored people of Boston\\" about policemen acting as slave catchers Before Brown left Springfield in 1850, the United States passed the Fugitive Slave Act, a law mandating that authorities in free states aid in the return of escaped slaves and imposing penalties on those who aided in their escape. In response Brown founded a militant group to prevent slaves' capture, the League of Gileadites. In the Bible, Mount Gilead was the place where only the bravest of Israelites gathered to face an invading enemy. Brown founded the League with the words, \\"Nothing so charmes the American people as personal bravery. [Blacks] would have ten times the number [of white friends than] they now have were they but half as much in earnest to secure their dearest rights as they are to ape the follies and extravagances of their white neighbors, and to indulge in idle show, in ease, and in luxury.\\" Upon leaving Springfield in 1850, he instructed the League to act \\"quickly, quietly, and efficiently\\" to protect slaves that escaped to Springfield‚Äîwords that would foreshadow Brown's later actions preceding Harpers Ferry. From Brown's founding of the League of Gileadites onward, not one person was ever taken back into slavery from Springfield. Brown gave his rocking chair to the mother of his beloved black porter, Thomas Thomas, as a gesture of affection. Some popular narrators have exaggerated the unfortunate demise of Brown and Perkins' wool commission in Springfield along with Brown's later life choices. In actuality, Perkins absorbed much of the financial loss, and their partnership continued for several more years, with Brown nearly breaking even by 1854. Brown's time in Springfield sowed the seeds for the future financial support he received from New England's great merchants, introduced him to nationally famous abolitionists like Douglass and Truth, and included the foundation of the League of Gileadites. During this time, Brown also helped publicize David Walker's speech Appeal. Brown's personal attitudes evolved in Springfield, as he observed the success of the city's Underground Railroad and made his first venture into militant, anti-slavery community organizing. In speeches, he pointed to the martyrs Elijah Lovejoy and Charles Turner Torrey as whites \\"ready to help blacks challenge slave-catchers.\\"Reynolds, 2005, p. 124 In Springfield, Brown found a city that shared his own anti-slavery passions, and each seemed to educate the other. Certainly, with both successes and failures, Brown's Springfield years were a transformative period of his life that catalyzed many of his later actions. Homestead in New York John Brown's Farm, North Elba, New York In 1848, Brown heard of Gerrit Smith's Adirondack land grants to poor black men, called Timbuctoo, and decided to move his family there to establish a farm where he could provide guidance and assistance to the blacks who were attempting to establish communities in the area. He bought from Smith land in the town of North Elba, New York (near Lake Placid), for $1 an acre ($2/ha), and spent two years there. After he was executed, his wife took his body there for burial; 12 of his collaborators were later buried in a mass grave there. Since 1895, the John Brown Farm and Gravesite has been owned by New York State and it is now a National Historic Landmark. Actions in Kansas After the Harpers Ferry raid, trial, and Brown's execution, Brown was linked forever to those events in Virginia, and to a lesser extent to his burial site in remote North Elba, New York. However, while alive, Brown was thought of as a Kansan. He is the subject of a controversial mural in the Kansas State Capitol. Kansas Territory was in the midst of a state-level civil war from 1854 to 1860, referred to as the Bleeding Kansas period, between those who wanted and those who opposed slavery in the future new state of Kansss. The issue was to be decided by the voters of Kansas, but who these voters were was not clear; there was widespread voting fraud in favor of the pro-slavery forces. =Move to Kansas= In 1855, Brown learned from his adult sons in Kansas that their families were completely unprepared to face attack, and that pro-slavery forces there were militant. Determined to protect his family and oppose the advances of slavery supporters, Brown left for Kansas, enlisting a son-in-law and making several stops just to collect funds and weapons. As reported by the New York Tribune, Brown stopped en route to participate in an anti-slavery convention that took place in June 1855 in Albany, New York. Despite the controversy that ensued on the convention floor regarding the support of violent efforts on behalf of the free state cause, several people gave Brown financial support. As he went westward, Brown found more militant support in his home state of Ohio, particularly in the strongly anti-slavery Western Reserve section, where he had been reared. =Pottawatomie= John Brown, 1856 Brown and the free settlers were optimistic that they could bring Kansas into the union as a slavery-free state. After the winter snows thawed in 1856, the pro-slavery activists began a campaign to seize Kansas on their own terms. Brown was particularly affected by the sacking of Lawrence in May 1856, in which a sheriff-led posse destroyed newspaper offices and a hotel. Only one man, a Border Ruffian, was killed. Preston Brooks's caning of anti-slavery Senator Charles Sumner in the United States Senate also fueled Brown's anger. A pro- slavery writer, Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow, of the Squatter Sovereign, wrote that \\"[pro-slavery forces] are determined to repel this Northern invasion, and make Kansas a slave state; though our rivers should be covered with the blood of their victims, and the carcasses of the abolitionists should be so numerous in the territory as to breed disease and sickness, we will not be deterred from our purpose\\".Reynolds, 2005, p. 162 Brown was outraged by both the violence of the pro-slavery forces and what he saw as a weak and cowardly response by the antislavery partisans and the Free State settlers, whom he described as \\"cowards, or worse\\".Reynolds, 2005, pp. 163‚Äì64 The Pottawatomie massacre occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856. Using swords, Brown and a band of abolitionist settlers took from their residences and killed five \\"professional slave hunters and militant pro-slavery\\" settlers north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas. Speaking of the threats that were supposedly the justification for the massacre, Free State leader Charles L. Robinson stated: > When it is known that such threats were as plenty as blue-berries in June, > on both sides, all over the Territory, and were regarded as of no more > importance than the idle wind, this indictment will hardly justify midnight > assassination of all pro-slavery men, whether making threats or not ... Had > all men been killed in Kansas who indulged in such threats, there would have > been none left to bury the dead.Robinson, Charles. The Kansas Conflict. > 1892. Reprint. Lawrence, Kans.: Journal Publishing Co., 1898. In the two years prior to the Pottawatomie Creek massacre, there had been eight killings in Kansas Territory attributable to slavery politics, but none in the vicinity of the massacre. The massacre was the match in the powderkeg that precipitated the bloodiest period in \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" history, a three- month period of retaliatory raids and battles in which 29 people died.Watts, Dale E. \\"How Bloody Was Bleeding Kansas?\\" , Kansas History: A Journal of the Central Plains18 (2) (Summer 1995): pp. 116‚Äì29. =Palmyra and Osawatomie= A force of Missourians, led by Captain Henry Pate, captured John Jr. and Jason, and destroyed the Brown family homestead, and later participated in the Sack of Lawrence. On June 2, John Brown, nine of his followers, and 20 local men successfully defended a Free State settlement at Palmyra, Kansas, against an attack by Pate (see Battle of Black Jack). Pate and 22 of his men were taken prisoner.Reynolds, 2005, pp. 180‚Äì81, 186 After capture, they were taken to Brown's camp, and received all the food Brown could find. Brown forced Pate to sign a treaty, exchanging the freedom of Pate and his men for the promised release of Brown's two captured sons. Brown released Pate to Colonel Edwin Sumner, but was furious to discover that the release of his sons was delayed until September. In August, a company of over 300 Missourians under the command of General John W. Reid crossed into Kansas and headed towards Osawatomie, intending to destroy the Free State settlements there, and then march on Topeka and Lawrence.Reynolds, 2005, p. 199 On the morning of August 30, 1856, they shot and killed Brown's son Frederick and his neighbor David Garrison on the outskirts of Osawatomie. Brown, outnumbered more than seven to one, arranged his 38 men behind natural defenses along the road. Firing from cover, they managed to kill at least 20 of Reid's men and wounded 40 more.Reynolds, 2005, pp. 200‚Äì01 Reid regrouped, ordering his men to dismount and charge into the woods. Brown's small group scattered and fled across the Marais des Cygnes River. One of Brown's men was killed during the retreat and four were captured. While Brown and his surviving men hid in the woods nearby, the Missourians plundered and burned Osawatomie. Despite his defeat, Brown's bravery and military shrewdness in the face of overwhelming odds brought him national attention and made him a hero to many Northern abolitionists.Reynolds, 2005, pp. 201‚Äì02 On September 7, Brown entered Lawrence to meet with Free State leaders and help fortify against a feared assault. At least 2,700 pro-slavery Missourians were once again invading Kansas. On September 14, they skirmished near Lawrence. Brown prepared for battle, but serious violence was averted when the new governor of Kansas, John W. Geary, ordered the warring parties to disarm and disband, and offered clemency to former fighters on both sides.Reynolds, 2005, pp. 203‚Äì04 Brown, taking advantage of the fragile peace, left Kansas with three of his sons to raise money from supporters in the North. Later years John Brown in 1859 =Gathering forces= Brown returned to the East by November 1856, and spent the next two years in New England raising funds. Initially he returned to Springfield, where he received contributions, and also a letter of recommendation from a prominent and wealthy merchant, George Walker. Walker was the brother-in-law of Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, the secretary for the Massachusetts State Kansas Committee, who introduced Brown to several influential abolitionists in the Boston area in January 1857. Amos Adams Lawrence, a prominent Boston merchant, secretly gave a large amount of cash. William Lloyd Garrison, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Theodore Parker and George Luther Stearns, and Samuel Gridley Howe also supported Brown. A group of six wealthy abolitionists‚ÄîSanborn, Higginson, Parker, Stearns, Howe, and Gerrit Smith‚Äîagreed to offer Brown financial support for his antislavery activities; they eventually provided most of the financial backing for the raid on Harpers Ferry, and came to be known as the Secret SixJason Emerson \\"The Secret Six,\\" American Heritage, Fall 2009. or the Committee of Six. Brown often requested help from them with \\"no questions asked\\" and it remains unclear how much of Brown's scheme the Secret Six were aware of. On January 7, 1858, the Massachusetts Committee pledged to provide 200 Sharps Rifles and ammunition, which were being stored at Tabor, Iowa. In March, Brown contracted Charles Blair of Collinsville, Connecticut for 1,000 pikes. In the following months, Brown continued to raise funds, visiting Worcester, Springfield, New Haven, Syracuse and Boston. In Boston, he met Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He received many pledges but little cash. In March, while in New York City, he was introduced to Hugh Forbes, an English mercenary, who had experience as a military tactician fighting with Giuseppe Garibaldi in Italy in 1848. Brown hired him as his men's drillmaster and to write their tactical handbook. They agreed to meet in Tabor that summer. Using the alias Nelson Hawkins, Brown traveled through the Northeast and then visited his family in Hudson, Ohio. On August 7, he arrived in Tabor. Forbes arrived two days later. Over several weeks, the two men put together a \\"Well-Matured Plan\\" for fighting slavery in the South. The men quarreled over many of the details. In November, their troops left for Kansas. Forbes had not received his salary and was still feuding with Brown, so he returned to the East instead of venturing into Kansas. He soon threatened to expose the plot to the government. William Maxon's house, near Springdale, Iowa, where John Brown's associates lived and trained, 1857‚Äì1859. Brown himself lived at the home of John Hunt Painter, less than a mile away. As the October elections saw a free-state victory, Kansas was quiet. Brown made his men return to Iowa, where he told them tidbits of his Virginia scheme.Jones, Louis Thomas (1914). The Quakers of Iowa. Iowa City: The State Historical Society of Iowa. p. 193: \\"A little over a year after his first visit to the Springdale neighborhood, Brown reappeared late in December, 1857‚Äîthis time with some ten companions and for purposes which he seemed not anxious to have known. The men were lodged with a Quaker, William Maxon, about three miles northeast of the village of Springdale, Brown agreeing to give in exchange for their keep such of his teams or wagons as might seem just and fair. Brown himself was taken into the home of John H. Painter, about a half-mile away; and all were welcomed with that unfeigned hospitality for which the Friends have always been known.\\" In January 1858, Brown left his men in Springdale, Iowa, and set off to visit Frederick Douglass in Rochester, New York. There he discussed his plans with Douglass, and reconsidered Forbes' criticisms.Morel, Lucas E. \\"In Pursuit of Freedom .\\" Teachinghistory.org ; retrieved June 30, 2011. Brown wrote a Provisional Constitution that would create a government for a new state in the region of his invasion. He then traveled to Peterboro, New York, and Boston to discuss matters with the Secret Six. In letters to them, he indicated that, along with recruits, he would go into the South equipped with weapons to do \\"Kansas work\\". Brown and 12 of his followers, including his son Owen, traveled to Chatham, Ontario, where he convened on May 10 a Constitutional Convention. The convention, with several dozen delegates including his friend James Madison Bell, was put together with the help of Dr. Martin Delany. One-third of Chatham's 6,000 residents were fugitive slaves, and it was here that Brown was introduced to Harriet Tubman. The convention assembled 34 blacks and 12 whites to adopt Brown's Provisional Constitution. Brown had long used the terminology of the Subterranean Pass Way from the late 1840s, so it is possible that Delany conflated Brown's statements over the years. Regardless, Brown was elected commander-in-chief and named John Henrie Kagi his \\"Secretary of War\\". Richard Realf was named \\"Secretary of State\\". Elder Monroe, a black minister, was to act as president until another was chosen. A. M. Chapman was the acting vice president; Delany, the corresponding secretary. In 1859, \\"A Declaration of Liberty by the Representatives of the Slave Population of the United States of America\\" was written. Although nearly all of the delegates signed the constitution, very few volunteered to join Brown's forces, although it will never be clear how many Canadian expatriates actually intended to join Brown because of a subsequent \\"security leak\\" that threw off plans for the raid, creating a hiatus in which Brown lost contact with many of the Canadian leaders. This crisis occurred when Hugh Forbes, Brown's mercenary, tried to expose the plans to Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson and others. The Secret Six feared their names would be made public. Howe and Higginson wanted no delays in Brown's progress, while Parker, Stearns, Smith and Sanborn insisted on postponement. Stearns and Smith were the major sources of funds, and their words carried more weight. To throw Forbes off the trail and invalidate his assertions, Brown returned to Kansas in June, and remained in that vicinity for six months. There he joined forces with James Montgomery, who was leading raids into Missouri. Portrait of John Brown by Ole Peter Hansen Balling, 1872 On December 20, Brown led his own raid, in which he liberated 11 slaves, took captive two white men, and looted horses and wagons. (See Battle of the Spurs.) The Governor of Missouri announced a reward of $3,000 () for his capture. On January 20, 1859, he embarked on a lengthy journey to take the liberated slaves to Detroit and then on a ferry to Canada. While passing through Chicago, Brown met with abolitionists Allan Pinkerton, John Jones, and Henry O. Wagoner who arranged and raised the fare for the passage to DetroitThe History of Johnson County, Iowa, 1883, pp. 475‚Äì77 and purchase clothes and supplies for Brown. Jones's wife, Mary, guessed that the supplies included the suit Brown was later hanged in.Junger, Richard, \\"Thinking Men and Women who Desire to Improve our Condition\\": Henry O. Wagoner, Civil Rights, and Black Economic Opportunity in Frontier Chicago and Denver, 1846‚Äì1887. in Alexander, William H., Cassandra L. Newby-Alexander, and Charles H. Ford, eds. Voices from within the Veil: African Americans and the Experience of Democracy. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009. p. 154 On March 12, 1859, Brown met with Frederick Douglass and Detroit abolitionists George DeBaptiste, William Lambert, and others at William Webb's house in Detroit to discuss emancipation.Underground Railroad, US Department of Interior, National Park Service, Denver Service Center. Duane Publishing, Feb 1, 1995, p. 168 DeBaptiste proposed that conspirators blow up some of the South's largest churches. The suggestion was opposed by Brown, who felt humanity precluded such unnecessary bloodshed.Toledo, Gregory. The Hanging of Old Brown: A Story of Slaves, Statesmen, and Redemption. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. p. 75 Over the course of the next few months, he traveled again through Ohio, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts to drum up more support for the cause. On May 9, he delivered a lecture in Concord, Massachusetts, that Amos Bronson Alcott, Emerson, and Thoreau attended. Brown reconnoitered with the Secret Six. In June he paid his last visit to his family in North Elba before departing for Harpers Ferry. He stayed one night en route in Hagerstown, Maryland, at the Washington House, on West Washington Street. On June 30, 1859, the hotel had at least 25 guests, including I. Smith and Sons, Oliver Smith and Owen Smith, and Jeremiah Anderson, all from New York. From papers found in the Kennedy Farmhouse after the raid, it is known that Brown wrote to Kagi that he would sign into a hotel as I. Smith and Sons.John Brown in Washington County , whilbr.org; accessed August 29, 2015. =Raid on Harpers Ferry armory= Harper's Weekly illustration of U.S. Marines attacking John Brown's \\"Fort\\" As he began recruiting supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by Harriet Tubman, \\"General Tubman,\\" as he called her.Clinton, p. 129. Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners. Some abolitionists, including Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, opposed his tactics, but Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for freed slaves and made preparations for military action. After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the South.Clinton, pp. 126‚Äì28. Brown asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did.Larson, p. 159. He arrived in Harpers Ferry on July 3, 1859. A few days later, under the name Isaac Smith, he rented a farmhouse in nearby Maryland. He awaited the arrival of his recruits. They never materialized in the numbers he expected. In late August he met with Douglass in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, where he revealed the Harpers Ferry plan. Douglass expressed severe reservations, rebuffing Brown's pleas to join the mission. Douglass had known of Brown's plans since early 1859 and had made a number of efforts to discourage blacks from enlisting. In late September, the 950 pikes arrived from Charles Blair. Kagi's draft plan called for a brigade of 4,500 men, but Brown had only 21 men (16 white and 5 black: three free blacks, one freed slave, and a fugitive slave). They ranged in age from 21 to 49. Twelve had been with Brown in Kansas raids. On October 16, 1859, Brown (leaving three men behind as a rear guard) led 18 men in an attack on the Harpers Ferry Armory. He had received 200 Beecher's Bibles‚Äîbreechloading .52 (13.2 mm) caliber Sharps rifles‚Äîand pikes from northern abolitionist societies in preparation for the raid. The armory was a large complex of buildings that contained 100,000 muskets and rifles, which Brown planned to seize and use to arm local slaves. They would then head south, drawing off more and more slaves from plantations, and fighting only in self-defense. As Douglass and Brown's family testified, his strategy was essentially to deplete Virginia of its slaves, causing the institution to collapse in one county after another, until the movement spread into the South, wreaking havoc on the economic viability of the pro-slavery states. Initially, the raid went well, and they met no resistance entering the town. They cut the telegraph wires and easily captured the armory, which was being defended by a single watchman. They next rounded up hostages from nearby farms, including Colonel Lewis Washington, great-grandnephew of George Washington. They also spread the news to the local slaves that their liberation was at hand. Two of the hostages' slaves also died in the raid.John Brown and the Harpers Ferry Raid , wvculture.org; accessed August 29, 2015. Things started to go wrong when an eastbound Baltimore & Ohio train approached the town. After holding the train, Brown inexplicably allowed it to continue on its way. At the next station, where the telegraph still worked, the passenger train conductor sent a telegram to B&O; headquarters in Baltimore: The railroad sent telegrams to President Buchanan and Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise. News of the raid reached Baltimore early that morning and Washington by late morning. In the meantime, local farmers, shopkeepers, and militia pinned down the raiders in the armory by firing from the heights behind the town. Some of the local men were shot by Brown's men. At noon, a company of militia seized the bridge, blocking the only escape route. Brown then moved his prisoners and remaining raiders into the engine house, a small brick building at the armory's entrance. He had the doors and windows barred and loopholes cut through the brick walls. The surrounding forces barraged the engine house, and the men inside fired back with occasional fury. Brown sent his son Watson and another supporter out under a white flag, but the angry crowd shot them. Intermittent shooting then broke out, and Brown's son Oliver was wounded. His son begged his father to kill him and end his suffering, but Brown said \\"If you must die, die like a man.\\" A few minutes later, Oliver was dead. The exchanges lasted throughout the day. Illustration of the interior of the Fort immediately before the door is broken down. Note hostages on the left. By the morning of October 18 the engine house, later known as John Brown's Fort, was surrounded by a company of U.S. Marines under the command of First Lieutenant Israel Greene, USMC, with Colonel Robert E. Lee of the United States Army in overall command.Hoffman, Colonel Jon T., USMC: A Complete History, Marine Corps Association, Quantico, VA, (2002), p. 84. Army First Lieutenant J. E. B. Stuart approached under a white flag and told the raiders their lives would be spared if they surrendered. Brown refused, saying, \\"No, I prefer to die here.\\" Stuart then gave a signal. The Marines used sledgehammers and a makeshift battering ram to break down the engine room door. Lieutenant Israel Greene cornered Brown and struck him several times, wounding his head. In three minutes Brown and the survivors were captives. Altogether, Brown's men killed four people and wounded nine. Ten of Brown's men were killed, including his sons Watson and Oliver. Five escaped, including his son Owen, and seven were captured along with Brown. Among the raiders killed were John Henry Kagi, Lewis Sheridan Leary, and Dangerfield Newby; those hanged besides Brown included John Anthony Copeland, Jr. and Shields Green. The trial Brown and the others captured were held in the office of the armory. On October 18, 1859, Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise, Virginia Senator James M. Mason, and Representative Clement Vallandigham of Ohio arrived in Harpers Ferry. Mason led the three-hour questioning session of Brown. right The old Court House at Charles Town, Jefferson County, Virginia, where John Brown was tried; it stands diagonally across the street from the jail () The Jefferson County Jail at Charles Town, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia), where John Brown was imprisoned during and after his trial, since torn down and now the site of the Charles Town post office Although the attack had taken place on federal property, Wise wanted him tried in Virginia, and President Buchanan did not object. Murder was not a federal crime, nor was inciting a slave insurrection, and federal action would bring abolitionist protests. Brown and his men were tried in Charles Town, the nearby seat of Jefferson County, just west of Harpers Ferry. The trial began October 27, after a doctor pronounced the still-wounded Brown fit for trial. Brown was charged with murdering four whites and a black, inciting slaves to rebel, and treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia. A series of lawyers were assigned to him, including Lawson Botts, Thomas C. Green, Samuel Chilton, a lawyer from Washington D.C., and George Hoyt, but it was Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, who concluded the defense on October 31. In his closing statement, Griswold argued that Brown could not be found guilty of treason against a state to which he owed no loyalty and of which he was not a resident, that Brown had not killed anyone himself, and that the raid's failure indicated that Brown had not conspired with slaves. Andrew Hunter, the local district attorney, presented the closing arguments for the prosecution. On November 2, after a week-long trial and 45 minutes of deliberation, the Charles Town jury found Brown guilty on all three counts. He was sentenced to be hanged in public on December 2. The trial attracted reporters who were able to send their articles via the new telegraph. They were reprinted in numerous papers. This is the first trial in the U.S. to be nationally reported. =November 2 to December 2, 1859= In response to the sentence, Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked that \\"[John Brown] will make the gallows glorious like the Cross.\\" Cadets from the Virginia Military Institute under the leadership of General Francis H. Smith and Major Thomas J. Jackson (who earned the nickname \\"Stonewall\\" less than two years later) were called into service as a security detail in the event Brown's supporters attempted a rescue. During the month before his execution, Brown was allowed visitors, and, glad for the publicity, he talked with anyone who wanted to see him, including reporters, who had not been allowed access before. He sent many letters and received a similar number. One of the letters was from Mahala Doyle, wife and mother of three of Brown's Kansas victims. She wrote \\"Altho' vengeance is not mine, I confess that I do feel gratified to hear that you were stopped in your fiendish career at Harper's Ferry.\\" In a postscript she added \\"My son John Doyle whose life I beg[g]ed of you is now grown up and is very desirous to be in Charlestown on the day of your execution.\\"Oates (1984) pp. 344‚Äì45 Brown refused to be rescued by Silas Soule, a friend from Kansas who somehow infiltrated the Jefferson County Jail one day and offered to break him out during the night and flee northward to New York state and possibly Canada. Brown supposedly told Silas that, aged 59, he was too old to live a life on the run from the federal authorities as a fugitive and that he was ready to die as a martyr. Silas left him behind to be executed. Many of Brown's letters exuded spirituality and conviction and, when picked up by the Northern press, won him more supporters in the North while infuriating many white people in the South. On December 1, Brown's wife arrived by train in Charles Town, where she joined him at the county jail for his last meal. She was denied permission to stay the night, prompting Brown to lose his composure and temper for the only time during the ordeal. The Governor of Virginia was so concerned about an attempt to rescue Brown that he halted almost all transportation on the Winchester and Potomac Railroad (from Maryland south through Harpers Ferry to Charles Town) from the day before through the day after the execution (see Winchester and Potomac Railroad#John Brown's raid). =Victor Hugo's reaction= Victor Hugo, from exile on Guernsey, tried to obtain pardon for John Brown: he sent an open letter that was published by the press on both sides of the Atlantic. This text, written at Hauteville-House on December 2, 1859, warned of a possible civil war: The letter was initially published in the London News and was widely reprinted. After Brown's execution, Hugo wrote a number of additional letters about Brown and the abolitionist cause. Abolitionists in the United States saw Hugo's writings as evidence of international support for the anti-slavery cause. The most widely publicized commentary on Brown to reach America from Europe was an 1861 pamphlet, John Brown par Victor Hugo, that included a brief biography and reprinted two letters by Hugo, including that of December 9, 1859. The pamphlet's frontispiece was an engraving of a hanged man by Hugo that became widely associated with the execution.Drescher, Seymour, \\"Servile Insurrection and John Brown's Body in Europe\\". in Finkelman, Paul, ed.

He read his Bible and wrote a final letter to his wife, which included his will. At 11:00 a.m. he rode on a furniture wagon, sitting on his coffin, from the county jail through a crowd of 2,000 soldiers to a small field a few blocks away where the gallows were. Among the soldiers in the crowd were future Confederate general Stonewall Jackson, and John Wilkes Booth (the latter borrowing a militia uniform to gain admission to the execution).Evan Carton, Patriotic Treason: John Brown and the Soul of America (2006), pp. 332‚Äì33. The poet Walt Whitman, in Year of Meteors, described viewing the execution.Walt Whitman Archive: \\"Year of Meteors\\"; accessed October 19, 2020. Brown was accompanied by the sheriff and his assistants, but no minister since he had consistently rejected the ministrations of pro-slavery clergy. Since the region was in the grips of virtual hysteria, most Northerners, including journalists, were run out of town, and it is unlikely any anti-slavery clergyman would have been safe, even if one were to have sought to visit Brown. He elected to receive no religious services in the jail or at the scaffold. He was hanged at 11:15 a.m. and pronounced dead at 11:50 a.m. =Transportation of his body= John Brown's tombstone, North Elba, New York Grave of John Brown Brown's body was placed in a wooden coffin with the noose still around his neck. His coffin was then put on a train to take it away from Virginia to his family homestead in New York for burial. His body was supposed to be embalmed in Philadelphia, through which the train would pass. However, because of demonstrations expected from both sides‚Äîthere were many Southern pro-slavery medical students in Philadelphia‚ÄîMayor Alexander Henry \\"made a fake casket, covered with flowers and flags which was carefully lifted from the coach and the train and sped onward in its destination ... In reality the train carrying Brown's body never actually stopped in Philadelphia, and thus violence was averted by a 'sham coffin'.\\" As a direct result, many Southern medical students and professors left Philadelphia en masse on December 21, 1859, for Southern medical schools, never to return. In the North, large memorial meetings took place, church bells rang, minute guns were fired, and famous writers such as Emerson and Thoreau joined many Northerners in praising Brown.David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 378‚Äì79 =Senate investigation= John Brown on the way to be executed ‚Äì two and one-half blocks from the Jefferson county jail to his scaffold On December 14, 1859, the U.S. Senate appointed a bipartisan committee to investigate the Harpers Ferry raid and to determine whether any citizens contributed arms, ammunition or money to John Brown's men. The Democrats attempted to implicate the Republicans in the raid; the Republicans tried to disassociate themselves from Brown and his acts. The Senate committee heard testimony from 32 witnesses, including Liam Dodson, one of the surviving abolitionists. The report, authored by chairman James Murray Mason, a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, was published in June 1860. It found no direct evidence of a conspiracy, but implied that the raid was a result of Republican doctrines. The two committee Republicans published a minority report, but were apparently more concerned about denying Northern culpability than clarifying the nature of Brown's efforts. Republicans such as Abraham Lincoln rejected any connection with the raid, calling Brown \\"insane\\".David Donald, Lincoln (1995) p. 239 The investigation was performed in a tense environment in both houses of Congress. One senator wrote to his wife that \\"The members on both sides are mostly armed with deadly weapons and it is said that the friends of each are armed in the galleries.\\" After a heated exchange of insults, a Mississippian attacked Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania with a Bowie knife in the House of Representatives. Stevens' friends prevented a fight.Oates (1984), p. 359 The Senate committee was very cautious in its questions of two of Brown's backers, Samuel Howe and George Stearns, out of fear of stoking violence. Howe and Stearns later said that the questions were asked in a manner that permitted them to give honest answers without implicating themselves.Oates (1984), pp. 359‚Äì60 Civil War historian James M. McPherson stated that \\"A historian reading their testimony, however, will be convinced that they told several falsehoods.\\"James M. McPherson. Battle Cry of Freedom. New York: Oxford University Press (1988), p. 207. =Aftermath of the raid= In listing the series of events that led to the American Civil War (see sidebar), John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry is the last. After it, there are no more \\"pre- war\\" incidents. War came next.David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 356‚Äì84. Southern slaveowners, hearing initial reports that hundreds of abolitionists were involved, were relieved the effort was so small, but feared other abolitionists would emulate Brown and attempt to lead slave rebellions. Therefore, the South reorganized the decrepit militia system. These militias, well-established by 1861, became a ready-made Confederate army, making the South better prepared for war.Daniel W. Crofts, Reluctant Confederates: Upper South Unionists in the Secession Crisis (1989), pp. 70 ff Southern Democrats charged that Brown's raid was an inevitable consequence of the Republican Party's political platform, which they associated with abolitionism. In light of the upcoming elections in November 1860, the Republicans tried to distance themselves as much as possible from Brown, condemning the raid and dismissing its leader as an insane fanatic. As one historian explains, Brown was successful in polarizing politics: \\"Brown's raid succeeded brilliantly. It drove a wedge through the already tentative and fragile Opposition-Republican coalition and helped to intensify the sectional polarization that soon tore the Democratic party and the Union apart.\\" Many abolitionists in the North viewed Brown as a martyr, sacrificed for the sins of the nation. Immediately after the raid, William Lloyd Garrison published a column in The Liberator, judging Brown's raid \\"well-intended but sadly misguided\\" and \\"wild and futile\\".\\"The Tragedy at Harper's Ferry\\" , fair-use.org; accessed November 12, 2015. But he defended Brown's character from detractors in the Northern and Southern press and argued that those who supported the principles of the American Revolution could not consistently oppose Brown's raid. On the day Brown was hanged, Garrison reiterated the point in Boston: \\"whenever commenced, I cannot but wish success to all slave insurrections\\".See opposed any use of violence on principle John Brown and the Principle of Nonresistance December 16, 1859 After the Civil War, Frederick Douglass wrote, \\"His zeal in the cause of my race was far greater than mine‚Äîit was as the burning sun to my taper light‚Äîmine was bounded by time, his stretched away to the boundless shores of eternity. I could live for the slave, but he could die for him.\\"Frederick Douglass, John Brown. An Address at the Fourteenth Anniversary of Storer College, May 30, 1881; online at Project Gutenberg , gutenberg.org; accessed November 12, 2015. Views of contemporaries Many Black leaders of the timeMartin Delany, Henry Highland Garnet, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubmanknew and respected Brown. \\"Tubman thought Brown was the greatest white man who ever lived.\\" Douglass called him \\"a brave and glorious old man. ...History has no better illustration of pure, disinterested benevolence.\\" Black businesses across the North closed on the day of his execution. Church bells tolled across the North. Shortly after Brown's death, Victor Hugo predicted it \\"would open a latent fissure that will finally split the Union asunder\\", and many poets responded to the event. In 1863 Julia Ward Howe wrote the popular hymn the Battle Hymn of the Republic to the tune of \\"John Brown's body\\", which included a line \\"As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free\\", comparing Brown's sacrifice to that of Jesus Christ. =Views of historians and other writers= Writers continue to vigorously debate Brown's personality, sanity, motivations, morality, and relation to abolitionism. In his posthumous The Impending Crisis, 1848‚Äì1861 (1976), David Potter argued that the emotional effect of Brown's raid exceeded the philosophical effect of the Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debates, and reaffirmed a deep division between North and South. Malcolm X said that white people could not join his black nationalist Organization of Afro-American Unity, but \\"if John Brown were still alive, we might accept him\\". Some writers describe Brown as a monomaniacal zealot, others as a hero. In 1931, the United Daughters of the Confederacy and Sons of Confederate Veterans erected a counter-monument, to Heyward Shepherd, a free black man who was the first fatality of the Harpers Ferry raid, claiming without evidence that he was a \\"representative of Negroes of the neighborhood, who would not take part\\". By the mid-20th century, some scholars were fairly convinced that Brown was a fanatic and killer, while some African Americans sustained a positive view of him.Louis A. DeCaro Jr., \\"Black People's Ally, White People's Bogeyman: A John Brown Story\\" in Andrew Taylor and Eldrid Herrington (editors), The Afterlife of John Brown (New York: Palgrave/Macmillan, 2005), pp. 11‚Äì26.David S. Reynolds, John Brown, Abolitionist: The Man Who Killed Slavery, Sparked the Civil War, and Seeded Civil Rights (2005); Stephen Oates quoted at Journalist Richard Owen Boyer considered Brown \\"an American who gave his life that millions of other Americans might be free\\", and others held similarly positive views.Russell Blake. \\"Review of Peterson, Merrill D., John Brown: The Legend Revisited\\". H-CivWar, H-Net Reviews. December 2006. online See also and Several 21st- century works about Brown are notable for the absence of hostility that characterized similar works a century earlier (when Lincoln's anti-slavery views were de-emphasized). Journalist and documentary writer Ken Chowder considers Brown \\"stubborn ... egoistical, self-righteous, and sometimes deceitful; yet ... at certain times, a great man\\" and argues that Brown has been adopted by both the left and right, and his actions \\"spun\\" to fit the world view of the spinner at various times in American history. Toledo (2002), Peterson (2002), DeCaro (2002, 2007), Reynolds (2005), and Carton (2006) are critically appreciative of Brown's history, far from the opinions of earlier writers. The shift to an appreciative perspective moves many white historians toward the view long held by black scholars such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Benjamin Quarles, and Lerone Bennett, Jr. =Historiography= Once the Reconstruction era ended and the country distanced itself from the anti-slavery cause and the martial law imposed in the South, the historical view of Brown changed. In the 1880s, Brown's detractors‚Äîsome of them contemporaries now embarrassed by their former fervent abolitionism‚Äîbegan to produce virulent expos√©s, emphasizing the Pottawatomie killings of 1856. Historian James Loewen surveyed American history textbooks prior to 1995 and noted that until about 1890, historians considered Brown perfectly sane, but from about 1890 until 1970, he was generally portrayed as insane. After that, new interpretations began to gain ground. Although Oswald Garrison Villard's 1910 biography of Brown was thought to be friendly (Villard being the grandson of abolitionist Garrison), he also added fuel to the anti-Brown fire by criticizing him as a muddled, pugnacious, bumbling, and homicidal madman.Frederick J. Blue in American Historical Review (April 2006) v. 111, pp. 481‚Äì82. Villard himself was a pacifist and admired Brown in many respects, but his interpretation of the facts provided a paradigm for later anti-Brown writers. Similarly, a 1923 textbook stated, \\"the farther we getaway from the excitement of 1859 the more we are disposed to consider this extraordinary man the victim of mental delusions.\\" In 1978, NYU historian Albert Fried concluded that historians who portrayed Brown as a dysfunctional figure are \\"really informing me of their predilections, their judgment of the historical event, their identification with the moderates and opposition to the 'extremists.'\\"Albert Fried, John Brown's Journey: Notes & Reflections on His America & Mine (Garden City, NY: Anchor/Doubleday, 1978), p. 272. This view of Brown has come to prevail in academic writing as well as in journalism. Biographer Louis DeCaro Jr. wrote in 2007, \\"there is no consensus of fairness with respect to Brown in either the academy or the media.\\"Louis A. DeCaro Jr., John Brown ‚Äì The Cost of Freedom: Selections from His Life & Letters (New York: International Publishers, 2007), pp. 16‚Äì17, More recent portrayals of Brown as another Timothy McVeigh or Osama bin Laden may still reflect the same bias Fried discussed a generation ago. * Some historians, such as Paul Finkelman, compare Brown to contemporary terrorists such as Osama bin Laden and Timothy McVeigh, Finkelman calling him \\"simply part of a very violent world\\" and further stating that Brown \\"is a bad tactician, a bad strategist, he's a bad planner, he's not a very good general‚Äîbut he's not crazy\\". * Historian James Gilbert labels Brown a terrorist by 21st-century criteria. Gilbert writes: \\"Brown's deeds conform to contemporary definitions of terrorism, and his psychological predispositions are consistent with the terrorist model.\\"James N. Gilbert, \\"A Behavioral Analysis of John Brown: Martyr or Terrorist?\\" Terrible Swift Sword: The Legacy of John Brown, edited by Peggy A. Russo and Paul Finkelman (Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, 2005), p. 112. * Biographer Stephen B. Oates has described Brown as \\"maligned as a demented dreamer ... (but) in fact one of the most perceptive human beings of his generation\\". * Biographer David S. Reynolds gives Brown credit for starting the Civil War or \\"killing slavery\\", and cautions others against identifying Brown with terrorism.David S. Reynolds, John Brown, Abolitionist: The Man Who Killed Slavery, Sparked the Civil War, and Seeded Civil Rights (2005). Reynolds saw Brown as inspiring the Civil Rights Movement a century later, adding \\"it is misleading to identify Brown with modern terrorists.\\"Reynolds, (2005); for historiography see Merrill D. Peterson, John Brown: The Legend Revisited (2002) and review by Aimee Lee Cheek, Journal of Southern History 70:2 (2004) pp. 435‚Äì36. * Biographer Louis A. DeCaro Jr., who has debunked many historical allegations about Brown's early life and public career, concludes that although he \\"was hardly the only abolitionist to equate slavery with sin, his struggle against slavery was far more personal and religious than it was for many abolitionists, just as his respect and affection for black people was far more personal and religious than it was for most enemies of slavery\\".Louis A. DeCaro Jr., \\"Fire from the Midst of You\\": A Religious Life of John Brown (New York: NYU Press, 2002), p. 6 * Historian and Brown documentary scholar Louis Ruchames wrote: \\"Brown's action was one of great idealism and placed him in the company of the great liberators of mankind.\\"Louis Ruchames, A John Brown Reader (New York: Abelard & Schuman, 1959), p. 12 * Biographer Otto Scott introduced his work on Brown by writing: \\"In the late 1850s a new type of political assassin appeared in the United States. He did not murder the mighty‚Äîbut the obscure. ... his purposes were the same as those of his classic predecessors: to force the nation into a new political pattern by creating terror.\\"Otto Scott, The Secret Six: John Brown and the Abolitionist Movement (Murphys, Calif.: Uncommon Books, 1979, 1983), p. 3 * Lawyer Brian Harris writes: \\"Whatever view you take of the consequences of Harpers Ferry, and for all that it was a botched job which resulted in the unnecessary deaths of innocents, it had at least the merit of having been undertaken for the noblest of motives. The same cannot be said for the sadistic butchery that was Pottawatomie. It served no useful purpose other than to vent an old man's rage, and Brown is the smaller for it.\\"Brian Harris. Intolerance: Divided Societies on Trial, Wildy, Simmonds & Hill, 2008. Influences An 1856 daguerreotype of Brown The connection between John Brown's life and many of the slave uprisings in the Caribbean was clear from the outset. Brown was born during the period of the Haitian Revolution, which saw Haitian slaves revolting against the French. The role the revolution played in helping to formulate Brown's abolitionist views directly is not clear; however, the revolution had an obvious effect on the general view towards slavery in the northern United States. As W. E. B. Du Bois notes, the involvement of slaves in the American Revolutions, as well as the \\"upheaval in Hayti, and the new enthusiasm for human rights, led to a wave of emancipation which started in Vermont ... swept through New England and Pennsylvania, ending finally in New York and New Jersey\\". This changed sentiment, which occurred during the late 18th and early 19th century, undoubtedly had a role in creating Brown's abolitionist opinion, during his upbringing. The 1839 slave insurrection aboard the Spanish ship La Amistad, off the coast of Cuba, provides a poignant example of John Brown's support and appeal towards Caribbean slave revolts. On La Amistad, Joseph Cinqu√© and approximately 50 other slaves captured the ship, slated to transport them from Havana to Puerto Pr√≠ncipe, Cuba in July 1839, and attempted to return to Africa. However, through trickery, the ship ended up in the United States, where Cinque and his men stood trial. Ultimately, the courts acquitted the men because at the time the international slave trade was illegal in the United States. According to Brown's daughter, \\"Turner and Cinque stood first in esteem\\" among Brown's black heroes. Furthermore, she noted Brown's \\"admiration of Cinques' character and management in carrying his points with so little bloodshed!\\" In 1850, Brown would refer affectionately to the revolt, in saying \\"Nothing so charms the American people as personal bravery. Witness the case of Cinques, of everlasting memory, on board the Amistad.\\" The slave revolts of the Caribbean had a clear and important impact on Brown's views toward slavery and his staunch support of the most severe forms of abolitionism. However, this is not the most important part of the many revolts' legacy of influencing Brown. The specific knowledge John Brown gained from the tactics employed in the Haitian Revolution, and other Caribbean revolts, was of paramount importance when Brown turned his sights to the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. As Brown's cohort Richard Realf explained to a committee of the 36th Congress, \\"he had posted himself in relation to the wars of Toussaint L'Ouverture ... he had become thoroughly acquainted with the wars in Hayti and the islands round about.\\" By studying the slave revolts of the Caribbean region, Brown learned a great deal about how to properly conduct guerilla warfare. A key element to the prolonged success of this warfare was the establishment of maroon communities, which are essentially colonies of runaway slaves. As a contemporary article notes, Brown would use these establishments to \\"retreat from and evade attacks he could not overcome. He would maintain and prolong a guerilla war, of which ... Haiti afforded\\" an example. The idea of creating maroon communities was the impetus for the creation of John Brown's \\"Provisional Constitution and Ordinances for the People of the United States\\", which helped to detail how such communities would be governed. However, the idea of maroon colonies of slaves is not an idea exclusive to the Caribbean region. In fact, maroon communities riddled the southern United States between the mid-1600s and 1864, especially in the Great Dismal Swamp region of Virginia and North Carolina. Similar to the Haitian Revolution, the Seminole Wars, fought in modern-day Florida, saw the involvement of maroon communities, which although outnumbered by native allies were more effective fighters. Although the maroon colonies of North America undoubtedly had an effect on John Brown's plan, their impact paled in comparison to that of the maroon communities in places like Haiti, Jamaica, and Surinam. Accounts by Brown's friends and cohorts prove this idea. Richard Realf, a cohort of Brown in Kansas, noted that Brown not only studied the slave revolts in the Caribbean, but focused more specifically on the maroons of Jamaica and those involved in Haiti's liberation. Brown's friend Richard Hinton similarly noted that Brown knew \\"by heart\\" the occurrences in Jamaica and Haiti. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a cohort of Brown's and a member of the Secret Six, stated that Brown's plan involved getting \\"together bands and families of fugitive slaves\\" and \\"establish them permanently in those [mountain] fastnesses, like the Maroons of Jamaica and Surinam\\". Brown had planned for the maroon colonies established to be \\"durable\\", and thus able to endure over a prolonged period of war. The similarities between John Brown's attempted insurrection and the Haitian Revolution in methods, motivations, and resolve is still seen today: the main avenue in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince is still named for Brown as a sign of solidarity. Legacy =Literature= In 1927, white supremacist Thomas Dixon Jr. published a screenplay entitled The Torch; A story of the paranoiac who caused a great war. It was never produced. The two most noted screen portrayals of Brown were both given by actor Raymond Massey. The 1940 film Santa Fe Trail, starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, depicted Brown completely unsympathetically as an out-and-out villainous madman; Massey added to that impression by playing him with a constant, wild-eyed stare. The film gave the impression that it did not oppose slavery, even to the point of having a Black \\"mammy\\" character say, after an especially fierce battle, \\"Mr. Brown done promised us freedom, but ... if this is freedom, I don't want no part of it\\". Massey portrayed Brown again in the little-known, low-budget Seven Angry Men, in which he was not only the main character, but depicted in a much more restrained, sympathetic way. Massey along with Tyrone Power and Judith Anderson starred in the acclaimed 1953 dramatic reading of Stephen Vincent Benet's epic Pulitzer Prize-winning poem John Brown's Body (1928). Three actors in formal dress recited and acted in a two-hour presentation of the poem. The production toured 60 cities in 28 states. Numerous American poets have written poems about him, including John Greenleaf Whittier, Louisa May Alcott, and Walt Whitman.McGinty, Brian. p. 289 The Polish poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid wrote two poems praising Brown: \\"John Brown\\" and the better known \\"Do obywatela Johna Brown\\" (\\"To Citizen John Brown\\"). Marching Song (1932) is an unpublished play about the legend of John Brown by Orson Welles. Russell Banks's 1998 biographical novel about Brown, Cloudsplitter, was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. It is narrated by Brown's surviving son Owen.Banks, Russell. Cloudsplitter. New York: Harper Flamingo, 1998. James McBride's 2013 novel The Good Lord Bird tells Brown's story through the eyes of a young slave, Henry Shackleford, who accompanies Brown to Harpers Ferry. The novel won the 2013 National Book Award for Fiction. A limited episode series based on the book was released starring Ethan Hawke as John Brown. =Paintings= her mulatto child. Currier and Ives print, 1863. * The best-known image of Brown in the later 19th century is a Currier and Ives print, based on a lost painting by Louis Ransom. It portrays Brown as a Christ-like figure. The \\"Virgin and Child\\" typically depicted with Christ are here a black mother and mulatto child (see Children of the plantation). Legend says that Brown kissed the baby. Above his head, like a halo, the flag of Virginia and its motto, Sic semper tyrannis (\\"Thus always to tyrants\\"); according to Brown's supporters, the government of Virginia was tyrannical.

Union and Confederate forces are fighting, with casualties. A tornado approaches in the background, as does a prairie fire, both common in Kansas. * In 1938, Kansas painter John Steuart Curry was commissioned to prepare murals for the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka, Kansas. He chose as his subject the Kansan John Brown, seen by many as the most important man in Kansas history. In the resulting mural, Tragic Prelude, Brown holds a Bible in one hand and a \\"Beecher's Bible\\" (rifle) in the other. Behind him are Union and Confederate troops, with dead soldiers; a reference to the Bleeding Kansas period, which Brown was at the center of, and which was commonly seen to have been a dress rehearsal, a \\"tragic prelude\\", to the increasingly inevitable Civil War. Brown's last words before his execution were that he had concluded that violence was unfortunately necessary, and desirable, since there were no other means to end slavery. Frederick Douglass argued against John Brown's plan to attack the arsenal at Harpers Ferry, painting by Jacob Lawrence. * In 1941, Jacob Lawrence illustrated Brown's life in The Legend of John Brown, a series of 22 gouache paintings. By 1977, these were in such fragile condition that they could not be displayed, and the Detroit Institute of Arts had to commission Lawrence to recreate the series as silkscreen prints. The result was a limited-edition portfolio of 22 hand-screened prints, published with a poem, John Brown, by Robert Hayden, commissioned specifically for the project. Though Brown had been a popular topic for many painters, The Legend of John Brown was the first series to explore his legacy from an African-American perspective. Paintings such as Hovenden's The Last Moments of John Brown immortalize an apocryphal story in which a Black woman offers the condemned Brown her baby to kiss on his way to the gallows. It was probably a tale invented by journalist James Redpath.Furnas, J. C.

He was appreciated by many (including the Queen) for his competence and companionship, and resented by others for his influence and informal manner. The exact nature of his relationship with Victoria was the subject of great speculation by contemporaries and remains controversial. Early life Brown was born on 8 December 1826 at Crathienaird, Crathie and Braemar Aberdeenshire, to Margaret Leys and John Brown,\\"Scotland Births and Baptisms, 1564‚Äì1950\\", database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XYXQ-M21 : 2 January 2015), John Brown, 08 Dec 1826; citing CRATHIE AND BRAEMAR, ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND, reference ; FHL microfilm 993,177gravestone of John Brown in Crathie Kirkyard, Aberdeenshire and went to work as an outdoor servant (in Scots ghillie or gillie) at Balmoral Castle, which Queen Victoria and Prince Albert leased in February 1848, and purchased outright in November 1851. Brown had several younger brothers and a sister, three of whom also entered the royal service. His brother Archibald Anderson \\"Archie\\" Brown, 15 years John's junior, eventually became personal valet to Victoria's youngest son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany.Scottish Tartans Authority Relationship with Queen Victoria Prince Albert's untimely death in 1861 was a shock from which Queen Victoria never fully recovered. John Brown became a good friend and supported the Queen. Victoria gave him gifts and created two medals for him, the Faithful Servant Medal and the Devoted Service Medal. She also commissioned a portrait of him. Victoria's children and ministers resented the high regard she had for Brown, and inevitably, stories circulated that there was something improper in their relationship. Victoria herself dismissed the chatter as \\"ill-natured gossip in the higher classes\\". A young John Brown as sketched by Queen Victoria The diaries of Lewis Harcourt contain a report that one of the Queen's chaplains, Rev. Norman Macleod, made a deathbed confession repenting his action in presiding over Queen Victoria's marriage to John Brown.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1429127/Victoria-did-become-Mrs- Brown.html viewed 23 November 2016 Debate continues over this report. Harcourt did not receive the confession directly (he was nine when Macleod died) but rather, it passed (if it did) from Macleod's sister to the wife of Henry Ponsonby, the Queen's private secretary, and thence to Harcourt's father Sir William Harcourt, then Home Secretary. Harcourt served as Home Secretary in the final three years of Brown's life. While it is true that some widowed monarchs have contracted private marriages with their servants, there is little evidence that Victoria married Brown. Perhaps the most compelling evidence of the depth of Victoria and Brown's relationship comes from the pen of the Queen herself. A letter from Victoria to Viscount Cranbrook, written shortly after Brown's death but only rediscovered in 2004, reveals the true extent of the loss: Queen Victoria on \\"Fyvie\\" with John Brown at Balmoral, by George Washington Wilson, 1863; medium: carte de visite, size: 9.20 √ó 6.10 cm; from the collection of the National Galleries of Scotland The phrase \\"for the second time\\" relates to the death of Brown after the death of her husband Prince Albert. The historian who discovered the letter believed that it suggested that Victoria, in her mind, equated Brown's death with Albert's, and that she therefore viewed him as more than a servant, but also as a good friend and confidant. Whether Brown and Victoria were actual lovers, however, is not known. John Brown died, aged 56, at Windsor Castle on 27 March 1883, and is buried in Crathie Kirkyard, in the next plot to his parents and a number of his siblings. The inscription on his gravestone further shows the attachment between him and the Queen: Those who believe that the Queen saw Brown as little more than a servant point to the fact that after his death she became similarly attached to an Indian servant, Mohammed Abdul Karim, one of two who had come to work for her in late June 1887. She called him the Munshi, and he came to be resented even more than John Brown. Unlike Brown, whose loyalty was not questioned, there were unevidenced contemporary claims that Abdul Karim exploited his position for personal gain and prestige. Tony Rennell's book Last Days of Glory: The Death of Queen Victoria reveals that Victoria had entrusted detailed instructions about her burial to her doctor, Sir James Reid (Brown died in 1883: the Queen's wish was for him to attend to her). These included a list of the keepsakes and mementoes, photographs and trinkets to be placed in the coffin with her: along with Albert's dressing gown and a plaster cast of his hand, the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown's hair, his photograph, Brown's mother's wedding ring, given to her by Brown, along with several of his letters. The photograph, wrapped in white tissue paper, was placed in her left hand, with flowers arranged to hide it from view. She wore the ring on the third finger of her right hand. Statue of John Brown in the grounds of Balmoral The statues and private memorials that Victoria had created for Brown were destroyed at the order of her son, Edward VII, with whom Brown had often clashed and who resented Brown for his influence. Queen Victoria commissioned a life-sized statue of Brown by Edgar Boehm shortly after his death. The inscription read: Friend more than Servant. Loyal. Truthful. Brave. Self less than Duty, even to the Grave. When Victoria's son succeeded to the throne he had the statue moved to a less conspicuous site.  Death  Two days after being afflicted with erysipelas, which crippled him to the point of not being able to attend the queen for the first time in over eighteen years as her servant, John Brown died. \\"He was the best, truest heart that ever beat,\\" Queen Victoria wrote to Brown's sister-in- law, Jessie McHardy Brown. In a letter to the British poet Alfred Tennyson, to whom she commissioned lines for Brown's tombstone, Victoria eulogized her faithful servant: > He had no thought but for me, my welfare, my comfort, my safety, my > happiness. Courageous, unselfish, totally disinterested, discreet to the > highest degree, speaking the truth fearlessly and telling me what he thought > and considered to be \\"just and right,\\" without flattery and without saying > what would be pleasing if he did not think it right. . . . The comfort of my > daily life is gone‚Äîthe void is terrible‚Äîthe loss is irreparable!

Along the coast they lived on artificial mounds called terpen, built high enough to remain dry during the highest tide. A dense population of Chauci lived further inland, and they are presumed to have lived in a manner similar to the lives of the other Germanic peoples of the region. Their ultimate origins are not well understood. In the Germanic pre- Migration Period (i.e., before ) the Chauci and the related Frisians, Saxons, and Angles inhabited the Continental European coast from the Zuyder Zee to south Jutland., Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood uses the term 'North German' to distinguish them from the 'Rhine Germans' (the Caninnefates, Batavians, and \\"Frankish\\" tribes). All of these peoples shared a common material culture, and so cannot be defined archaeologically., Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood cites Todd's The Northern Barbarians 100 BC-AD 300 (1987) for this conclusion. The Chauci originally centered on the Weser and Elbe, but in they expanded to the River Ems by expelling the neighboring Ampsivarii,, The Annals, Bk XIII, Ch 55. Events of AD 54-58\\\\. The Germans under Arminius had wiped out 3 Roman legions under Varus at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. The Ampsivarii had not supported the German cause and had been ostracised as a result. Many years later, c. AD 58, the Chauci then took the opportunity to expel them and occupy their land at the mouth of the River Ems., Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood cites Tacitus as well as a number of other sources. whereby they gained a border with the Frisians to the west. The Romans referred to the Chauci living between the Weser and Elbe as the 'Greater Chauci' and those living between the Ems and Weser as the 'Lesser Chauci'., The Annals, Translator's note on Bk XI, Ch 19. The Chauci entered the historical record in descriptions of them by classical Roman sources late in the 1st century BC in the context of Roman military campaigns and sea raiding. For the next 200 years the Chauci provided Roman auxiliaries through treaty obligations, but they also appear in their own right in concert with other Germanic tribes, opposing the Romans. Accounts of wars therefore mention the Chauci on both sides of the conflict, though the actions of troops under treaty obligation were separate from the policies of the tribe. The Chauci lost their separate identity in the 3rd century when they merged with the Saxons,, Dark Age Naval Power. after which time they were considered to be Saxons. The circumstances of the merger are an unsettled issue of scholarly research. Society and life hallig Hooge The Germans of the region were not strongly hierarchical. This had been noted by Tacitus, for example when he mentioned the names of two kings of the 1st century Frisians and added that they were kings \\"as far as the Germans are under kings\\"., The Annals, Bk XIII, Ch 54. Events of AD 54-58. Haywood (Dark Age Naval Power, 1999) says the Chauci were originally neither highly centralised nor highly stratified, though they became more so after 100 AD., Dark Age Naval Power. The referenced footnote notes that the Chauci heartland between the Elbe and Weser contained huge cremation cemeteries with a uniform range of poor quality grave goods. In the 2nd century aristocratic cemeteries with rich grave goods appear. Yorke (The Conversion of Britain c.600‚Äì800, 2006), speaking of the 5th century, describes the 'Continental Saxons' (which then included the Chauci) as having powerful local families and a dominant military leader. Writing in AD 79, Pliny the Elder said that the Germanic tribes were members of separate groups of people, suggesting a distinction among them. He said that the Chauci, Cimbri and Teutonithe people from the River Ems through Jutland and for some distance inlandwere members of a group called Ingaevones (a \\"Cimbri\\" people were also given as members of a different group, and this is likely a different people)., Natural History, Bk IV, Ch 28: Germany. A footnote suggests that the two references to the Cimbri in two different groups were not references to the same people. Tacitus, writing in AD 98, described the inland, non-coastal Chauci homeland as immense, densely populated, and well-stocked with horses. He was effusive in his praise of their character as a people, saying that they were the noblest of the Germans, preferring justice to violence, being neither aggressive nor predatory, but militarily capable and always prepared for war if the need arose., The Germany, XXXV. Pliny (AD 23-79) had visited the coastal region and described the Chauci who lived there. He said that they were \\"wretched natives\\" living on a barren coast in small cottages (or huts) on hilltops, or on mounds of turf built high enough to stay dry during the highest tide (i.e., terpen). They fished for food, and unlike their neighbors (i.e., those living inland, away from the coast) they had no cattle, and had nothing to drink except rainwater caught in ditches. They used a type of dried mud (i.e., \\"surface peat\\") as fuel for cooking and heating. He also mentioned their spirit of independence, saying that even though they had nothing of value, they would deeply resent any attempt to conquer them., Natural History, Bk XVI, Ch I: Countries that have no trees. Pliny also notes that the Chauci lived between the Rivers Ems and Elbe. Classical Roman history The record is incomplete. The bulk of historical information about the Chauci is from the Annals of Tacitus, written in 117. Many parts of his works have not survived, including an entire section covering the years AD 38-46, as well as the years after AD 69\\\\. The earliest mention of the Chauci is from 12 BC and suggests that they were assisting other Germanic tribes in a war against the Romans. Drusus campaigned against those Germans along the lower Rhine, and after devastating the lands west and north of the Rhine he won over (or defeated or intimidated) the Frisians. He was in the process of attacking the Chauci when his vessels were trapped by an ebb tide. Drusus gave up the attack and withdrew., Roman History, Bk LIV, Ch 32. =Aftermath of Teutoburg Forest, c. 15= The Germans under Arminius had destroyed 3 Roman legions under Varus at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9\\\\. The Romans recoiled at first but then Germanicus initiated destructive campaigns against those Germans whom the Romans blamed for their defeat. The Chauci were not among them, and were said to have promised aid, and were associated with the Romans in \\"military fellowship\\"., The Annals, Bk I, Ch 60. Events of AD 15-16. However, in defeating Arminius' own tribe (the Cherusci) the Romans were unable to capture or kill Arminius, who escaped. There were Chauci among the Roman auxiliaries, and they were rumored to have allowed the escape., The Annals, Bk II, Ch 17. Events of AD 16-19 In one of the campaigns a Roman fleet (probably riverine, not ocean- going) was broken up by a storm, causing many casualties. Germanicus himself managed to survive by reaching the lands of the Chauci, who provided him with a safe haven., The Annals, Bk II, Ch 24. Events of AD 16-19. Germanicus campaigns had resulted in recovery of two of three Aquila lost in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest defeat;the third legionary standard was recovered in AD 41 by Publius Gabinius from the Chauci during the reign of Claudius, brother of Germanicus.Cassius Dio, Roman History Book LX, Chapter 8 A parenthetical note concerns the Ampsivarii. They had not supported the German cause led by Arminius in 9 AD and had been ostracized as a result. The Chauci had suffered no such disaffection from the other Germanic tribes in the aftermath of Teutoburg Forest, nor had they alienated the Romans. Many years later, , the Chauci seized an opportunity to expel the Ampsivarii and occupy their lands at the mouth of the River Ems, whereby they gained a border with the Frisians to the west., The Annals, Bk XIII, Ch 55. Events of AD 54-58. =Roman war against Gannascus, c. 47= Reconstruction of a fluvial boat of the Classis Germanica (Rhine flotilla) in the 1st century AD. In AD 47 (and perhaps for some time earlier), the Chauci along with the Frisians were led by a certain Gannascus of the Canninefates. They raided along the then-wealthy coast of Gallia Belgica (i.e., the land south of the Rhine and north of the Rivers Marne and Seine), and the Chauci made inroads into the region that would later become the neighbouring Roman province of Germania Inferior, in the area of the Rhine delta in what is now the southern Netherlands., The Annals, Bk XI, Ch 18-19\\\\. Events of AD 47-48. Corbulo was made the local Roman military commander. He successfully engaged the Germans on both land, The Annals, Bk XVI, Ch 17. Events of 65-66 (Rome and ParthiaCampaigns of Corbulo in the East). Tacitus makes the parenthetical comment that Corbulo had driven the Chauci out of the provinces of Lower Germany which they had invaded in AD 47. and water, occupied the Rhine with his triremes and sent his smaller vessels up the estuaries and canals. The Germanic flotilla was destroyed in a naval engagement, Gannascus was driven out, and Frisian territory was forcibly occupied. A negotiation between the Romans and Gannascus was arranged under the auspices of the 'Greater Chauci', which the Romans used as an opportunity to assassinate their opponent. The Chauci were outraged by the act of bad faith, so the emperor Claudius forbade further attacks on the Germans in an effort to ease tensions, and the Romans withdrew to the Rhine., The Annals, Bk XI, Ch 18-19\\\\. Events of AD 47-48. =Batavian Revolt, c. 69= In AD 69 the Batavi and other tribes rose against Roman rule in the Revolt of the Batavi, becoming a general uprising by all the Germans in the region. Led by Civilis, they inflicted huge casualties on the Romans, including the destruction of a Roman fleet by a Germanic one off the North Sea coast., Dark Age Naval Power. Led by Cerialis, the Romans gave as good as they had gotten, ultimately forcing a humiliating peace on the Batavi and stationing a legion on their territory. Both the Chauci and the Frisians had auxiliaries serving under the Romans, and in a siege and assault by Civilis at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis (at modern Cologne), a cohort of Chauci and Frisians had been trapped and burned., The Histories, Translator's Summary of Chief Events., The Histories, Bk IV, Ch 79. The Chauci had supported Civilis in their own name, providing him with reinforcements., The Histories, Bk V, Ch 19. A footnote makes reference to \\"Cp IV.79\\". Sea raiding The Chauci were one of the most prominent early Germanic sea raiders., Dark Age Naval Power. They are probable participants in the Germanic flotilla that was destroyed by Drusus in 12 BC. They were raiding the coasts of Roman Belgica in AD 41,, Dark Age Naval Power. long before they participated in further raids of the same coasts under Gannascus in AD 47\\\\. It is likely that their raiding was endemic over the years, as the few surviving accounts probably do not reflect all occurrences. Tacitus describes the Chauci as 'peaceful' in his Germania (AD 98), but this is in a passage describing the non-coastal, inland Chauci,, The Germany, XXXV. whereas sea raiders are necessarily a coastal people. By the late 2nd century Chauci raiding was ongoing and more serious than before, continuing in the English Channel until their last recorded raids -175., Dark Age Naval Power. While there are no historical sources to inform us one way or the other, it is likely that the Chauci continued their raiding and then played a role in the formation of the new Germanic powers, the Franks and Saxons who were raiders in the 3rd century., Dark Age Naval Power. There is archaeological evidence of destruction by raiders between 170-200, ranging along the Continental coast down to the Bay of Biscay, to northwest Belgica (e.g., fire destruction at Amiens, Th√©rouanne, Vendeuil-Caply, Beauvais, Bavai, Tournai, and Arras), to coastal Britain (e.g., fire destruction at the Essex sites of Chelmsford, Billericay, Gestingthorpe, Braintree, Wickford, Kelvedon, Great Chesterford, and Harlow). The perpetrators are unknown, but Chauci raiders are among the prime suspects., Dark Age Naval Power. The Romans responded with defensive measures. Caistor-by-Norwich, Chelmsford and Forum Hadriani (present day Voorburg) (the civitas of the Canninefates near The Hague) were all fortified , and the Romans began a defensive system of protection especially along the coasts of Britain and the Continent. This system would be continually maintained and improved upon, which the Romans would not have done unless there was a continuing threat to be addressed. The system would continue to evolve through the disappearance of Chauci raiders and their replacement by the Frankish and Saxon ones, up to the end of the 4th century. By then it would be known as the Saxon Shore, a name given it by the Notitia Dignitatum., Dark Age Naval Power. A passage written by Zosimus has been interpreted as one of the last mentions of the Chauci, and one where they are specifically mentioned as a Saxon group; but it depends upon whether we can equate them with the \\"Kouadoi\\" in Zosimus's Greek, a name he had apparently used wrongly. Julian fought against Saxons and Franks, including the Salians, but then allowed the Salians \\"descended from the Franks\\" to settle in Toxandria in 358. According to Zosimus, this happened in response to an attack from the sea by the \\"Kouadoi\\" Saxons which affected both Romans and Salians, who had been living in the river delta.Zosimus Nova Historia Book III In literature Beowulf is an Old English heroic poem where the hero (Beowulf) engages in battles with antagonists.

Ethnically, Pliny the Elder groups them with their neighbours, the Suebi and Chatti, as well as the Hermunduri, as Hermiones, one of the Germanic groupings said to descend from an ancestor named Mannus. They led an important war against the Roman Empire. Subsequently, they were probably absorbed into the late classical Germanic tribal groups such as the Saxons, Thuringians, Franks, Bavarians and Allemanni. Etymology The etymological origin of the name Cherusci is not known with certainty. According to the dominant opinion in scholarship, the name may derive from the ancient Germanic word *herut (Modern English hart, i. e. \\"deer\\"). The tribe may have been named after the deer because it had a totemistic significance in Germanic symbolism.Reallexikon der germanischen Alterturmskunde (1981), vol. 4, p. 430 ff., s.v. \\"Cherusker\\"; cf. also Rudolf Much, Herbert Jankuhn & Wolfgang Lange, Die Germania des Tacitus, Heidelberg: Winter, 1967, p. 411. A different hypothesis, proposed in the 19th century by Jacob Grimm and others, derives the name from *heru-, a word for \\"sword\\" (cf. Gothic hairus, Old English heoru).Jacob Grimm, Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache, 2nd ed., Leipzig 1853, vol. 2, p. 426. Hans Kuhn has argued that the derivational suffix -sk-, involved in both explanations, is otherwise not common in Germanic. He suggested that the name may therefore be a compound of ultimately non-Germanic origin, connected to the hypothesized Nordwestblock.Reallexikon der germanischen Alterturmskunde (1973), vol. 1, pp.420‚Äì421, s.v. \\"Arminius\\". History The Hermannsdenkmal in the southern part of the Teutoburg Forest, Germany The first historical mention of the Cherusci occurs in Book 6.10 of Julius Caesar's De Bello Gallico, which recounts events of 53 BC. Caesar relates that he crossed the Rhine again to punish the Suebi for sending reinforcements to the Treveri. He mentions that the Bacenis forest (a relatively impenetrable beech forest, possibly the Harz) separated the territory of the Cherusci from that of the Suebi. In 12 BC, the Cherusci and other Germanic tribes were subjugated by the Romans. They appear to have been living in the same homeland when Tacitus wrote, 150 years later, describing them as living east of the Chauci and Chatti. This is generally interpreted to be an area between the rivers Weser and Elbe. As Rome tried to expand in northern Europe beyond the Rhine, it exploited divisions within the Cherusci, and for some time the tribe was considered a Roman ally. At this time, the tribe was split between Arminius (known in modern German as \\"Hermann der Cherusker\\", although his actual Germanic name was more likely Erminazhttps://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Salon/2385/FAQ.html%23hermann&date;=2009-10-25+09:25:32) and Segestes. Arminius advocated breaking allegiance to Rome and declaring independence, while Segestes wanted to remain loyal. By about 8 AD, Arminius had gained the upper hand and began planning rebellion. Segestes repeatedly warned Publius Quinctilius Varus, the governor of Gaul, that rebellion was being planned, but Varus declined to act until the rebellion had broken out. In 9 AD, in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, an army of allied Germanic tribes under the command of Arminius (the Cherusci, Bructeri, Marsi, Sicambri, Chauci, and Chatti) annihilated three Roman legions commanded by Varus. The legions' eagle standards, of great symbolic importance to the Romans, were lost. The numbers of these three legions, Legio XVII, Legio XVIII, and Legio XIX, were never used again. After the mutinies of the German legions in 14 AD, Germanicus decided, at the urging of his men, to march into Germany to restore their lost honor. In 15 AD, after a quick raid on the Chatti, they invaded the lands of the Marsi in 14 AD with 12,000 legionnaires, 26 cohorts of auxiliaries, and eight cavalry squadrons. According to Tacitus (Annals 1, 51), an area of 50 Roman miles wide was laid to waste with fire and sword: \\"No sex, no age found pity.\\" A legion eagle from Varus's defeat, either from the XVII or XVIII, was recovered. Then, he began a campaign against the Cherusci. He received an appeal to rescue Segestes, who was besieged by Arminius. Segestes was rescued, along with a group of relatives and dependents, including Thusnelda, Segestes' daughter and the wife of Arminius. Germanicus spared them and gave them land in Gaul. He then found the site of the Battle of Teutoburg Forest. His men buried the dead and built a funeral mound. A series of battles followed. After major casualties on the Romans, Tiberius forbid further campaigns. This effectively led to the withdrawal of the Roman troops until the collapse of the Roman Empire. After Arminius' death, the Romans left the Cherusci more or less to their own devices. In 47 AD, the Cherusci asked Rome to send Italicus, the nephew of Arminius, to become king, as civil war had destroyed their nobility. He was initially well liked, but since he was raised in Rome as a Roman citizen, he soon fell out of favor. Tacitus writes of the Cherusci of his time (about 100 AD): > Dwelling on one side of the Chauci and Chatti, the Cherusci long cherished, > unassailed, an excessive and enervating love of peace. This was more > pleasant than safe, for to be peaceful is self-deception among lawless and > powerful neighbours. Where the strong hand decides, moderation and justice > are terms applied only to the more powerful; and so the Cherusci, ever > reputed good and just, are now called cowards and fools, while in the case > of the victorious Chatti success has been identified with prudence. The > downfall of the Cherusci brought with it also that of the Fosi, a > neighbouring tribe, which shared equally in their disasters, though they had > been inferior to them in prosperous days. Claudius Ptolemy in his Geography, describes the ŒßŒ±ŒπœÅŒøœÖœÉŒ∫Œø·Ω∂ and ŒöŒ±ŒºŒ±œÖŒø·Ω∂ (Cherusci and Chamavi) as living near each other and also near to \\"Mount Melibocus\\" (probably the Harz Mountains) and to the Calucones, who lived on both banks of the Elbe. The later history of the Cherusci is mostly unknown. In the fourth century AD, they perhaps contributed to the formation of the Saxon people.
