Troy leads the all-time series at 5‚Äì3. History The South Alabama Jaguars were co-founding members of the Sun Belt Conference in 1976. Troy joined the conference in 2004 as a football-only member. In 2005, the Trojans transitioned the rest of their sports to the Sun Belt, and South Alabama and Troy began facing each other in sports other than football, since at that time, South Alabama did not have a football team. On December 6, 2007, South Alabama's Board of Trustees approved the addition of football to the intercollegiate athletics program. The team began play in 2009 with a planned full transition to the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (Division I-A) by 2013. In 2012, South Alabama's football team officially joined the school's other sports in the Sun Belt Conference and started to face the conference members in a full conference schedule. In 2015, the Student Government Associations of each school came together to officially dub the rivalry the \\"Battle for the Belt,\\" with a wrestling-style belt going to the winner of the rivalry annually. According to then South Alabama Student Government Association President Ravi Rajendra, \\"The introduction of the trophy to the rivalry will offer a new way for Jag Nation to connect with our football program. The concept behind the Belt stemmed from our student body and was accompanied by insight from our football team; the football team really liked the concept of a wrestling belt, and the Belt also plays off of the Sun Belt Conference of which both Troy and USA are members.\\" In 2017, the Sun Belt Conference announced to split its football member schools to two divisions starting for the 2018 season. Despite the close proximity of South Alabama and Troy, the conference separated the two, Troy in the East division and South Alabama in the West. In two separate divisions this could alter the annual series between schools. A year before the 2018 football season, the conference athletic directors at that time voted in favor of having South Alabama and Troy to play every season despite not being in the same division. This rivalry will be the only protected cross-divisional series in the conference. Game results = Game 1 (2012) = The South Alabama ‚Äì Troy football rivalry officially began on a rain-soaked Saturday, September 29, 2012, at historic Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, where Troy defeated the Jaguars 31‚Äì10. = Game 2 (2013) = The second meeting between the teams was a thriller. In a game where South Alabama dominated the stats, the Jags suffered a one-point loss in a battle that featured two lead changes in the final minutes, including a game-winning Troy touchdown with 7 seconds left on the clock. = Game 3 (2014) = The Jaguars claimed their first victory in the series with a convincing 27‚Äì13 win, and the rivalry was truly born. = Game 4 (2015) = The 4th game of the series took place in Troy. Troy had a bye week the week before giving them 2 weeks to build the hype. Troy had a huge pep rally with a bonfire on campus (in which Jaguar merchandise was burned) the Thursday night before the game. A car spray painted red, white, and blue (South Alabama's colors) was on campus and hammers were used to smash the car. This game was a \\"Blackout\\" game. All fans were encouraged to wear black. The first 10,000 fans into the stadium were given a free black T-shirt. A DJ was provided for the game for the students. South Alabama rolled to a 24‚Äì18 victory. = Game 5 (2016) = The 5th game of the series took place in Mobile. South Alabama jumped out to an early lead and had a 21‚Äì13 lead going into the 4th quarter. This lead would not hold however as Troy would score twice in the 4th quarter and win 28‚Äì21. The game winning touchdown was scored with 1:20 left in the game and Troy successfully ended their two game losing streak to South Alabama. \\"Troy sores in final 1:20, beats South Alabama 28-21\\" Pensacola News Journal = Game 6 (2017) = In the 6th game of the series the location was once again Troy. South Alabama came in and faced a Troy team that had recently upset LSU in Baton Rouge so Troy was the favorite to win the game. However, South Alabama pulled off an upset of their own by forcing four turnovers and defeating Troy 19‚Äì8. Troy missed two field goals and barely avoided the first shutout in the series by scoring a touchdown and two point conversion with 6:16 left in the game.\\"South Alabama shocks Troy 19-8 in 'Battle for the Belt'\\" AL.com = Game 7 (2018) = The 7th game of the series saw Troy come to Mobile trying to avenge their shocking loss to South Alabama a year prior. Troy led 31‚Äì17 at the end of the first half due to big plays by their offense. Neither team was able to score any points in the second half until a South Alabama interception set up Troy's offense at the South Alabama 11 yard line. Troy would have a total of six plays of 30 yards or more and force 4 turnovers as they went on to win 38‚Äì17.\\"Troy routs South Alabama 38-17 in 'Battle for the Belt'\\" AL.com = Game 8 (2019) = The 8th game in the series took place once again in Troy with Troy trying to be the first team to retain the belt for more than one year. South Alabama stayed with Troy through the first half and were only down 16‚Äì10 at half. Troy was able to pull away in the second half despite committing three turnovers throughout the game by holding South Alabama without a touchdown and forcing a pick six. Troy would go on to win 37‚Äì13, the largest margin of victory in the series, and became the first team to hold the belt for two consecutive years and the first team to win the belt at home.\\"Troy Pulls Away for 37-13 Victory over South Alabama in 'Battle for the Belt'\\" AL.com  See also  List of NCAA college football rivalry games References College football rivalries in the United States South Alabama Jaguars football Troy Trojans football 2012 establishments in Alabama ","title":"South Alabama‚ÄìTroy football rivalry"},{"id":"42894466","text":"\\"Don't Mention the World Cup\\", also titled \\"Don't Mention the War\\", is a 2006 song written by Dean Whitbread and Ashley Slater and performed by The First Eleven with John Cleese. Released to coincide with the 2006 FIFA World Cup, it was intended to dissuade supporters of the England national football team from referring to the Second World War while in Germany for the tournament.  History  The song references Cleese's Fawlty Towers character Basil Fawlty's line in \\"The Germans\\" episode: \\"Don't mention the war. I did but I think I got away with it\\". Cleese released this song as a way to try and change English feelings towards Germans and to move people away from associating Germans with the Second World War. Cleese recorded his lines for the song as Basil Fawlty. German authorities supported the song as a way to dissuade supporters of the England and Australia national football teams from displaying Nazi symbols or gestures during the World Cup. The song was also intended to get England fans to refrain from using rude words towards Germans. The song also made an allusion to comedian Stan Boardman's German jokes with the line, \\"They bombed our chip shops\\". Boardman, who also wrote a World Cup song, \\"Stan's World Cup Song\\", stated that he felt Cleese's use of his joke was \\"very cheeky\\" and didn't believe that Cleese had a chip shop in his hometown of Weston-Super- Mare.  Reception  \\"Don't Mention the World Cup\\" was released on 12 June 2006; however, it failed to chart in the UK Singles Charts. The song was also criticised in 3:AM Magazine, which gave it two stars and stated that \\"Cleese's flat delivery is Fawlty\\". Nonetheless, despite lack of UK chart success, press and television coverage was generally favourable. The song was featured on ITV news in a segment on football violence.

The game consisted of a typical, traditional fantasy football setup allowing the player to pick real life footballers to make up their fantasy football squad each week. Their fantasy team scored points based on how the players they have picked performed in their real life matches. The game could be played for free or for cash prizes in a poker-style entry fee format. Similar to most Fantasy sites at the time, Oulala was open to a limited number of sports and leagues. They offered play on the four major European football leagues, the English Premier League, the Spanish La Liga, the French Ligue 1 and the Italian Serie A so the player can pick a team with a mix of the finest players Europe has to offer. Oulala‚Äôs system includes 70 different criteria dependent on a player‚Äôs position resulting in a total of 275 ways to gain or lose points, ranging from the usual goals and assists to the more detailed shots on target and successful tackles, amongst many others, making it as close to football reality as possible. This data is sourced directly from Opta Sports. The game also featured in-play live management allowing real time substitutions to be made, a first in the world of fantasy football. Oulala ceased operations in 2018. Other information On February 26, 2014, the Maltese Minister for the Economy, Investment and Small Business, Dr Christian Cardona, officially inaugurated Oulala. This was reported on TVM, Malta's television station.

On June 29, 2014, Oulala featured in the business section of The Times of Malta. The newspaper reported that the game was succeeding in its launch of a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. In October 2014, London newspaper the Croydon Advertiser reported that Crystal Palace and Australia national team captain Mile Jedinak was ranked the fifth-best player in Europe and the best player in the Premier League by Oulala's diverse Opta sourced scoring matrix.

It is located adjacent to Rizal Shrine and is known as the christening site of Jos√© Rizal.  History  Jesuit Missionaries in 1757 purchased a big portion of land called Hacienda de San Juan for their missions but the parish was only established in 1779 by the Franciscan Friars upon gaining independence from the parochial church of Cabuyao (formerly known as Tabuco). The stone church was originally built in 1859 but destroyed on February 12, 1945 during the Second World War. The reconstruction of the church of Calamba was headed by Father Eliseo Dimaculangan. The original altar was burned in 1862 but immediately rebuilt by Father Leoncio Lopez. The first Filipino priest, Father Angel Villaruz, served the longest in this church for 43 years since 1901.  Features  The church of Calamba is a stone church built under the Baroque style. It has several stained glasses, two of which are in the church entrance depicting St. Dominic and San Lorenzo Ruiz.

If the Central Bank raised bank rates, the aim is to reduce money supply in the economy. With the high rates, people are expected to not take out loans and save their money in bank. Therefore, the amount of money will be reduced. Policy to raise bank rates is used to press inflation. Meanwhile, if the central bank lowers bank rates, it aims to increase the amount of money supply. With the low rates, people are not expected to save their money in bank. Thus, the amount of money circulating in the society will increase. The decline in bank rates made by the Central Bank if the economy goes into a recession or if the economy is run into deflation.  The United States discount rate policy  The United States Federal Reserve Seal of The United States government The United States Federal Reserve System lends money to eligible commercial institution called discount window, Purposely created in 1913 as a mean to operate the central bank in The United States. The interest on loans given out to commercial institutions are discount rate, which is a monetary policy tool used by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the U.S economy. Commercial banks mark up interest from the loans taken from the discount window to gain profit from interest on loan taken out by the public. With the high interest rates, people are less expected to take out loans. Thus, there are less money circulating in the economy, causing it to move in to a recessionary state. Decline in interest rates are made by the Central Bank if the economy goes into a recession. The Federal Reserve have varieties of tools along with the discount rate to manage and relieve tension in the economy. = Usage of the discount rate during The Great Recession = Statistical graph of 4.4 million jobs lost over 14 months in 2009 by Nancy Pelosi According to UC Berkeley researchers, commercial institutions started to give loan to subprime borrowers in order to increase profits on risky investments. Since they were more likely to default on their loans, banks were losing money which resulted in increase interest rates. Consequently, interest rate prices are higher than usual, people weren't taking out loans causing the economy to be contractionary. In turn, the Federal Reserve System recognized the problem and took counter measures to intervene with the downsizing economy. They decreased the interest rates at the discount window to bail out the economy during The Great Recession. Since the commercial banks are able to retrieve loans at a lower rate, this waterfalls down to the general public to be able to circulate money in the economy.

The Domingo Zamora House, also known as the Santos House, is a residential building which can be found in the village of Santo Ni√±o in Marikina, Metro Manila, Philippines. It was built in 1890 by Domingo Zamora, a known Filipino nationalist and one of the founders of the Iglesia Pilipina Independiente, a religious movement which emerged during the Spanish rule that advocates the Filipinization of the Church. History A closer view of the Zamora house. Note the wooden carvings under the eaves of the roofing. The materials used to construct the house was said to come from the drifting logs that float on the Marikina River from Rodriguez (formerly Montalban). Indigenous tribes such as the Aetas used to gather wood from the river and sell it to the settlers. In 1890, Domingo Zamora, whose elder brother Felipe Zamora was one of Rizal's co-propagandists in Madrid, Spain, constructed a military headquarters and garrison in guise of a residential house. Zamora is also a founder of the Iglesia Pilipina Independiente whose origin traces back from the struggle of the Filipino clergy against racial discrimination and friar domination within the Roman Church in the 19th century. Eventually, it turned into a nationalist crusade for the absolute Filipinization of the Church. During World War II, Japanese soldiers used the house as their headquarters. The house survived the destruction and bombing during the Liberation of the American forces and was used as a relief center for the war victims in which rice and other staple food are distributed. The ownership of the house was passed down to the side of Domingo Zamora's wife who came from a family of physicians. It is currently inhabited by the Santos family who also utilized a part of the house as a clinic. Architecture The tangka or chimney at the back of the Zamora house. The house is an example of a neo-classical Bahay na Bato with its use of pilaster, a classical architectural feature attached to the wall for decoration and support. Intricately designed carvings can be seen below the eaves of the roof. A notable feature of the house is the presence of a tangka or chimney at the back of the house, which was considered to be revolutionary back in its days. The interior is characterized with a high ceiling to allow natural ventilation. References See also Our Lady of the Abandoned Parish * List of landmarks and attractions of Marikina * Sta.

The song also appears in the 2017 live-action remake, where it is again performed by the characters of LeFou and Gaston, played by Josh Gad and Luke Evans, respectively. Synopsis \\"Gaston\\" sees Gaston and the village people singing about how great he is, in an effort to cheer him up after Belle's rejection. Gaston's talent ranges from fighting, to spitting, to eating excessive quantities of eggs with no apparent negative health impacts, to interior decoration. Gaston, however, is portrayed as somewhat unintelligent, or at least as a relatively poor chess player. \\"Gaston (Reprise)\\"' sees Gaston hatch a plan with the help of Le Fou to send Maurice to an insane asylum in order to force Belle to marry him in order to stop him. Composition The Globe and Mail described the song as a \\"Lerner and Loewe-flavoured drinking song\\". Versions In the theatrical version, the section where Le Fou forgets how to spell Gaston's name was cut, but was retained in the soundtrack.https://genius.com/Richard-white-gaston-lyrics It was reinstated in the 2017 live-action version, with Le Fou explaining that he is illiterate. The 2017 film includes lyric changes which Menken described as part of the original lyrics by Ashman that were cut from the animated film. Critical reception MDTheatreGuide deemed it \\"one of the highlights of the show\\". The Herald Sun noted the song \\"delivers the punches of humorous lyrical accomplishment as well as memorable choreography\\". In a review of the musical version, The Globe and Mail said it \\"stops the show midway through Act 1\\". ColumbiaUnderground called it \\"the second best song and dance number of the musical\\". SputnikMusic wrote \\"Ever one to recognize a true gem, Disney then decided to employ White and Corti for the subsequent song \\"Gaston\\" and its reprise as well. These numbers are from the scene in the local tavern just after Belle's capture by the Beast, and are perhaps best remembered for being the manliest songs in the entire film. White manages to come across as a pure paragon of maleness, sporting rippling musculature and bristling chest hair all at once. Herein, White comfortably busts out lines like \\"As you see I've got biceps to spare!\\" and \\"I'm especially good at expectorating - ptooey!\\" with much gusto. The gaggle of incompetent, second-rate buffoons in the background do a stunning job too, rolling out accompanying refrains like \\"No one plots likes Gaston!/Takes cheap shots like Gaston!/Likes to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston!\\" to rousing effect. Take it from me - it's ridiculously hard to come out of this one without having the burning desire to eat five dozen eggs per day and become roughly the size of a barge.\\" Soundtrackgeek wrote \\"For me...not much can beat the musical and lyrical genius of Belle and Gaston and their respective reprises. The two greatest character pieces in Disney's canon, these tracks introduce the story and style of the film staggeringly well, showing brilliant lyrical detail and hilarity, as well as giving a sublime showcase for Menken's talents\\".

Sung by the majority of the film's main cast, the song was recorded by American actors Paige O'Hara as Belle and Robby Benson as the Beast via voice over, featuring actors Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury and David Ogden Stiers as Lumiere, Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth, respectively. The only song performed by the Beast, \\"Something There\\" is heard midway through Beauty and the Beast during a scene in which Belle and the Beast finally begin to acknowledge their feelings for each other. A last-minute addition to the film, the simple love song was quickly written by Ashman and Menken to replace the more elaborate and ambitious \\"Human Again\\" after the latter was cut from Beauty and the Beast. O'Hara based her own vocal performance on that of American singer and actress Barbra Streisand, who Ashman advised the actress to impersonate, while O'Hara herself convinced the songwriters to have Benson record the song. Critical reception towards \\"Something There\\" has been positive, with film and music critics alike praising Ashman's abilities as both a songwriter and a storyteller. Background \\"Something There\\" was written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken. According to Menken, \\"Something There\\" was written as \\"a very quick replacement for ... 'Human Again',\\" the latter of which was ultimately cut from Beauty and the Beast because it was considered \\"too ambitious\\" for the film. Eleven minutes in length, producer Don Hahn explained that the song was cut because \\"We just couldn't figure out how to make it work and not take away from the central story of Belle.\\" Upon learning that \\"Human Again\\" was removed from Beauty and the Beast, Ashman and Menken were forced to return \\"to the drawing board to write something more contained and simple,\\" the ultimate result of which was the love song \\"Something There,\\" which has been described as \\"shorter and more direct\\" than \\"Human Again\\". The creative team had originally believed that the Beast saving Belle from the wolves was enough to justify the dance sequence near the end of the film, though later realised they had in fact not yet earned this moment; this quiet song where Beast gives Belle his library was pitched and written by Howard Ashman and \\"as soon as that was written, we knew the movie was going to work\\". In his biography I'm Not Dead... Yet!, actor Robby Benson, voice of the Beast, revealed that it was co-star Paige O'Hara's idea to have Benson's character duet with O'Hara's Belle in \\"Something There\\". According to Benson, the actress \\"explained to Ashman and Menken that [Benson] had made records and sang in Broadway musicals.\\" O'Hara briefly struggled to record one of the song's lines ‚Äì \\"a bit alarming\\" ‚Äì to which an ailing Ashman, who was forced to communicate with O'Hara and the studio via telephone from his hospital bed in New York due to his illness, simply responded \\"Streisand.\\" By this, Ashman meant that he wanted O'Hara to impersonate singer and actress Barbra Streisand, and by doing so O'Hara finally recorded the song successfully. \\"Something There\\" was recorded by O'Hara and Benson accompanied by a live orchestra. Context, sequence and analysis In the book The Meanings of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\": A Handbook, author Jerry Griswold observed that the \\"Something There\\" musical sequence is preceded by \\"the once feisty Belle ... bandaging and nursing [the Beast]\\" after he rescues her from the wolves. Contextually, the purpose of the song has been identified as \\"Dramatizing [Belle and the Beasts'] partnership.\\" Leading up to the musical sequence, the Beast first \\"surprises Belle by showing her his library and then they learn to eat together.\\" Author Robin O. Winter observed that \\"During the scene they begin to see beneath their outer appearances and start to appreciate each other's inner qualities,\\" while one critic identified this as one of the scenes in \\"which Belle and the Beast hesitantly slowly open up to one another.\\" Writing for Wesleyan University, Rachel Anne Silverman observed that \\"Something There\\" depicts \\"The first time Belle and the Beast's attraction is introduced,\\" describing the couple's relationship as \\"a passion that has developed over time.\\" Initially, Belle is alarmed \\"as she realizes her growing love for the Beast,\\" briefly hiding behind a tree as she sings. According to the Hal Leonard Corporation and Music Theatre International, the castle's staff of enchanted objects also discover \\"something different between Belle and the Beast.\\" \\"Something There\\" concludes with Belle and the Beast retreating to a fireplace and reading. In the original film, \\"Something There\\" immediately precedes the film's title song. However, for its special edition re-release, the song is immediately followed by the newly reinstated \\"Human Again\\".Screenshot of the Beast and Belle finally realizing that they are beginning to fall in love with each other during the \\"Something There\\" musical sequence.Identifying the song as \\"where the genius of music as storytelling kicks in,\\" Simon Brew of Den of Geek felt that \\"Something There\\" is \\"the track with the heaviest workload.\\" The author observed that \\"In two minutes and 19 seconds, [the song] gets across just how the position and feelings of the characters have changed.\\" For instance, \\"At the beginning of 'Something There,' Belle admits that she thought the Beast was mean, coarse, and unrefined. By the end, she‚Äôs feeling pretty smitten,\\" according to Oh My Disney. The song also depicts the film's passing of time, while providing audiences with an opportunity \\"to appreciate Beast and first see the potential for Belle and him.\\" On the song's role in the special edition version of the film, co-director Kirk Wise explained, \\"There's a ... little suite of music now that starts with 'Something There' ... which segues into 'Human Again' which gives the object perspective on what they hope for when [Belle and the Beast] fall in love and that transitions into 'Beauty and the Beast' the ballad, which is the culmination of their relationship.\\" Dubbing the song \\"soliloquies of Belle and the Beast,\\" TV Guide drew comparisons between \\"Something There\\" and songs from the musical South Pacific. The \\"Something There\\" musical sequence was added towards the end of Beauty and the Beast's filmmaking process. Belle was animated by Mark Henn, while the Beast was animated by Aaron Blaise. Henn described \\"Something There\\" as \\"a great sequence,\\" continuing, \\"I love to animate songs.\\" The Los Angeles Times Charles Solomon felt that Belle was drawn inconsistently throughout the film, observing that the character appears \\"noticeably slimmer\\" during \\"Something There\\".  Composition  Written in the key of D major at a quick allegretto tempo of 108 beats per minute in common time, the \\"playful\\" \\"Something There\\" is a Broadway musical-inspired duet in which Belle and the Beast finally conclude that \\"there's something there that wasn't there before.\\" The song spans a duration of two minutes and eighteen seconds, making it the third shortest song on the soundtrack behind the reprises of \\"Belle\\" and \\"Gaston\\", respectively. Describing \\"Something There\\" as \\"a fluffy song,\\" Filmtracks.com observed that the song \\"shares many instrumental devices with 'Belle';\\" one of Belle's verses in \\"Something There\\" serves as \\"a reprise of the secondary phrase from ['Belle']\\". Combined, O'Hara and Benson's vocal ranges span two octaves, from the low note of G3to the high note of E5. The song, described as \\"a poignant character number\\" performed \\"Against a background of the easy rhythms of soft, lilting violins,\\" \\"allowed [O'Hara and Benson] to blend their voices.\\" In addition, Women's Studies in Communication observed that the \\"tentative bursts of notes symbolize the uncertainties of this new way of relating\\". In the song's first verse, \\"Belle articulates how her attraction to [the Beast] stems from his shut-off demeanor,\\" singing, \\"There's something sweet/And almost kind/But he was mean/And he was coarse and unrefined/But now he's dear/And so unsure/I wonder why I didn't see it there before.\\" The Beast's verse reads, \\"when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw.\\" According to Laurence E. MacDonald, author of the book The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History, Benson \\"shocked many filmgoers with his richly resonant baritone.\\" Finally, Belle sings the song's bridge, which reads, \\"New and a bit alarming/Who'd have ever thought that this could be?/True, that he's no Prince Charming/But there's something in him that I simply didn't see.\\" According to the Los Angeles Times, by the end of \\"Something There\\", \\"the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem.\\"  Reception  \\"Something There\\" has garnered mostly positive reviews from film and music critics. Writing for Den of Geek, Simon Brew felt that \\"Something There\\" is \\"where the genius of music as storytelling kicks in.\\" In Brew's opinion, the \\"utterly convincing and un-mawkish\\" song works \\"because the two characters aren't on screen singing directly at each other.\\" Brew concluded, \\"Everyone who makes an animated film that has a love story at the heart should watch this.\\" Filmtracks.com described \\"Something There\\" as an \\"affable\\" song. Particularly praising Ashman's songwriting, Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Ashman's songs advance the plot by exploring the characters' emotions and making story points more concisely than conventional exposition.\\" Solomon concluded, \\"By the end of the deceptively simple-sounding 'Something There,' the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem.\\" O'Hara continues to cite \\"Something There\\" as her favorite of the film's songs, elaborating, \\"Every time I see the Beast with that grin on his face and the bird in his hand, my heart just melts.\\" For the studio's pending live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, Julia Emmanuele of Hollywood.com suggested that the filmmakers \\"feel free to drop 'Something There' if there‚Äôs no room for it\\" because \\"it won't be missed.\\" However, when English actress Emma Watson confirmed in January 2015 that she will be portraying Belle via Facebook, she cited \\"Something There\\" as one of her favorite songs from her childhood. Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic jokingly called \\"Something There\\" \\"the closest the movie comes to admitting its horrendously inappropriate stance on human-animal sexual relations.\\" References 1991 songs Vocal duets Disney Renaissance songs Songs from Beauty and the Beast Songs with lyrics by Howard Ashman Songs with music by Alan Menken ","title":"Something There"},{"id":"42895159","text":"\\"The Mob Song\\" is a song from the 1991 Disney animated film Beauty and the Beast.

He then proceeds to lead the angry mob up to the Beast's castle so that he can kill the Beast while the rest of the villagers rob the castle of its treasures. CommonSenseMedia explains that \\"misguided townspeople say scary and violent things about the Beast, proposing they kill him and mount his head on a wall.\\" At one point, Gaston says, \\"Screw your courage to the sticking place\\", which is a line from Macbeth.  Composition and analysis Lyricist Howard Ashman, who had AIDS by the time he wrote the song and viewed the Beast's curse as an allegory for AIDS, was inspired by public sentiment at the time against AIDS and the gay community when writing the song's lyrics.https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-gay- lefou-howard-ashman Beauty and the Beast producer Don Hahn further said that the song was written as \\"almost a metaphor for\\" the stigmatization against people with AIDS.https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16583/don-Hahn-interview- beauty-and-the-beast-howard-Ashman-the-lion-king-south-park-and-frankenweenie Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out claims the song \\"taps into this demonization of persons with AIDS\\". The book Sigmund Romberg says the song is \\"a cinematic recreation of Nelson Eddy's nocturnal march 'Stouthearted Men' in the 1940 musical film New Moon. The Cambridge Companion of Singing describes the song as a \\"parody\\" of the earlier number. Critical reception Unlocked described it as a \\"less time-consuming number\\". CommonSenseMedia said the song is one of the few things in the film that parents should be concerned about. WCPO said it was \\"dramatic\\" with \\"dark energy\\". 2017 version For the 2017 live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, Alan Menken adjusted the lyrics to reflect LeFou starting to turn against Gaston. Menken said that he changed the lyrics because director Bill Condon \\"wanted this sense of Gaston as a demagogue at that point, and the turnaround of Lefou\\".

All three songs are performed by Aladdin (Brad Kane in the film, Adam Jacobs in the musical, and Mena Massoud in the remake). Production Aladdin had a lot of rewrites during production, and many songs were cut as characters were written out of the script or as the plot was altered. At one point, the song which showed Aladdin being at his lowest point and wanting to strive for more with his life was entitled \\"Proud of Your Boy\\", and was directed at his mother, who was disappointed by his life choices. After being controversially cut, another attempt was 'Count On Me' a \\"low-key \\"I want\\" song\\" for Aladdin.

Aladdin is caught stealing a loaf of bread, and Razoul and the palace guards chase him through the streets of Agrabah, while Aladdin tells the audience that he must steal in order to survive. While dodging Razoul and the palace guards, Aladdin climbs up buildings, ducks behind street performers, swings into a harem, and even attracts the attention of some of the street ladies of Agrabah. The reprise of the song takes place immediately after when he starts to question what his life has become and if there is a better future for him. In the second reprise, which only appears in the remake, Aladdin realizes that he can't keep playing Prince Ali and has to tell Princess Jasmine that he isn't a prince, but a poor boy.

Originally intended for Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), the song was omitted when Aladdin's mother was written out of the story. The discarded song remained largely undiscovered by audiences until Disney released Ashman and Menken's demo on a compilation album in 1994, after which it gradually gained popularity. The ballad was eventually restored for the film's stage musical adaptation in 2011, originally performed and recorded by American actor Adam Jacobs. Lyrically, \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" is about a young man promising his mother that he will change his mischievous ways and ultimately make her proud. \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was one of the first songs Ashman and Menken wrote for Aladdin, about which Ashman was particularly fond. Some of Ashman's collaborators theorize that the lyricist based the song on his relationship with his own mother. Following Ashman's death during the film's production, the role of Aladdin's mother grew more inconsequential as the story was revised. Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg eventually insisted on both the mother and song being eliminated altogether, much to the disappointment of several crew members. Actors Scott Weinger and Brad Kane auditioned for the film using \\"Proud of Your Boy\\"; both were ultimately cast as Aladdin's speaking and singing voice, respectively. When the film's stage adaptation was green-lit, \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was one of the first songs Menken and playwright Chad Beguelin made a priority of putting back in the musical. In the play Aladdin sings the song in memory of his late mother. \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" premiered in the stage adaptation to mostly positive reviews from critics, some of whom named it the musical's best new addition, since becoming the show's signature song. Although most fans discovered the song via the musical, \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" had already become a cult favorite upon release of its demo, considered a popular audition song among the musical theatre community. Background and writing \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken, Menken also contributed to the song's lyrics. \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was one of the first few songs written for Aladdin, after \\"Arabian Nights\\" and \\"Friend Like Me\\". In early drafts of Aladdin's screenplay, Aladdin's mother is alive and central to the film's plot; she expresses disappointment in her son's behavior. Their relationship is a key part of \\"Proud of Your Boy\\"; Aladdin shares a heartfelt moment with his mother and promises to change for the better and acknowledging that he has not been a \\"perfect son\\". Ashman had strong feelings for the song being particularly attached to the role of Aladdin's mother. He asked to keep her and \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" in the film. Ashman is believed to have written \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" about his own parents. Ashman had worked with actress and singer Jodi Benson on Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989). Benson described the lyricist as an underdog struggling to believe in himself and said she believes Ashman wrote \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" out of a constant desire to please and make his parents proud. Director Ron Clements agreed the ballad \\"meant a lot to Ashman because of his own relationship with his mother.\\" However, producer Don Hahn refuted popular claims that Ashman had intentionally written \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" about their relationship querying, \\"Was it underneath the topic? Yeah, probably. But it was never overt. But we are artists, and artists do works that reflect their times.\\"alt=Originally intended to occur after \\"One Jump Ahead\\", \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was one of several solos written for Aladdin that were ultimately omitted from the film. Early storyboards of the sequence depict a disguised Jafar, suggesting that Aladdin's first meeting with the vizier had originally been envisioned differently. Following Ashman's death in 1991, the song was discarded and the story was revised, during which both the mother and song were written out of the movie. The part of Aladdin's mother became increasingly inconsequential, to the point where Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg dismissed the character as \\"a zero\\" and ordered her to be removed entirely following a test screening. With the mother not alive and Aladdin orphaned, \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was deemed unsalvageable as well as irrelevant to the film's narrative. The ballad was also considered to be too somber when compared to the other musical numbers in Aladdin. As Ashman died prior to the screening, there was no one available or willing to write a replacement or convince Katzenberg to save \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was highly regarded among the film's staff and creators, which they continued to cherish despite the character being written out of Aladdin. Story artist Ed Gombert maintains very few of Aladdin's filmmakers agreed with Katzenberg's decision, and many were saddened by the song's removal. Director John Musker believes the omission cost the film one of Ashman and Menken's \\"finest songs\\"; Clements described the song's elimination as \\"more painful\\" than those of the other deleted songs. Menken found it particularly challenging to cope with the song's omission, saying \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was the most difficult component of the film to lose due to Ashman's demise. Menken attempted to replace \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" by writing a song himself for Aladdin to sing to Abu entitled \\"You Can Count On Me\\", which was also rejected. The omission of \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" and Aladdin's mother led eventually to the completion of the film's romantic theme song, \\"A Whole New World\\", since Aladdin required a new ballad to replace it. \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was initially envisioned as the film's show-stopping ballad, until \\"A Whole New World\\" replaced it. After \\"Proud of Your Boy\\"'s omission, Aladdin's mother is never mentioned and no allusions to her are made. Jerry Beck, author of The Animated Movie Guide, wrote that the elimination of \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" and the mother resulted in Aladdin becoming \\"another Disney hero in a long line of motherless waifs\\".  Recording and release  After being cast as Aladdin's speaking voice, actor Scott Weinger lied to the filmmakers about his musical experience and auditioned to sing in the film by singing \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". Disney provided Weinger with sheet music and a demo recording of the song on audio cassette, which he rehearsed with a vocal coach. Ultimately unimpressed with his efforts, Menken informed Weinger \\"there was no way he would be singing in the film\\". The filmmakers assured him instead they would hire a professional singer to match with his speaking voice. Weinger joked that he still carries \\"a chip on my shoulder\\" over being denied a singing role in the film, and as of 2019 occasionally rehearses \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" with Menken. Singer Brad Kane was eventually cast as Aladdin's singing voice. He also had auditioned using \\"Proud of Your Boy\\", singing for both Ashman and Menken, but he did not hear back from Disney until a year after his audition. \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was the first song Kane sang for Aladdin; he also recorded it before it was discarded. In addition to being Menken's final collaboration with Ashman, \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was one of the last songs Ashman wrote before his death; he spent his final days listening to audition recordings of the song from his deathbed. Ashman and Menken's original demo recording was first released on the album The Music Behind the Magic (1994), a compilation box set consisting of unreleased material and demos from The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin. Andrea Baillie of News 95.7 wrote that the song's appearance on the album truly offered \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" \\"a second chance\\". Menken recalled that the song first experienced a resurgence in popularity following its appearance on the compilation, after which it was initially circulated among auditions, describing it as \\"this secret thing and people would perform it\\". It was used by Menken as the original audition song for the titular character in Hercules (1997) alongside \\"Shooting Star\\", which secured Roger Bart the role. This was the only medium on which the demo was available for quite a long time, until it was re-discovered in the Disney Vault approaching the release of an upcoming special edition DVD. The demo was then released as a bonus track on the special edition soundtrack release of Aladdin, with Menken performing lead vocals. This version was made available to the public on October 11, 2004. The song's history is explored in an Aladdin behind-the-scenes featurette hosted by Musker and co-director Ron Clements, dedicated to \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". Oh My Disney contributor Emily Brandon believes, prior to the stage adaptation, that awareness of the song's existence was limited to \\"Hardcore Aladdin fans\\". Having originated the role on stage, actor Adam Jacobs recorded the song for the original Broadway cast recording which was released on March 27, 2014. Context = Background = Disney producers and Ashman's collaborators had long held \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" in high regard, prior to the musical's inception. Menken deemed \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" a \\"lost gem\\" and prioritized including it in the musical once the project was greenlit, recognizing it among his several Disney compositions that eventually \\"find their way back into the spotlight\\" following omission from their original works. Disney Theatrical Productions associate producer Paula McKinnon reported that \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was one of the first songs the creative team agreed to reintroduce via the musical. Playwright and lyricist Chad Beguelin's Aladdin script was pitched to Menken. Beguelin had not initially written it for Broadway and he requested that it be revised to include as many of Ashman's discarded songs as possible, the first of which was \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". Deciding the musical would benefit from immediately establishing its \\"I want\\" song, Beguelin envisioned using \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" to \\"dr[ive Aladdin] through the rest of the show.\\" Expanding upon the original idea of Aladdin's mother, Beguelin opted to incorporate the song in the musical having Aladdin sing it \\"to the heavens\\" for his late mother. He said the ballad evolved into the musical's \\"through line\\" and \\"spine\\", believing the main character \\"wants to make good\\" but continues on \\"making these bad decisions and finally when he drops the line, drops the act and becomes his true self, all of his dreams come true.\\" Additionally Beguelin contributed new, original lyrics to the song's two reprises. Menken and Thomas Schumacher, president of Disney Theatrical Group, considered the song's resurrection a \\"personal victory\\". Identifying the song as one of his favorite restorations due to its pivotal message, Menken said he is especially thrilled Ashman's ‚ÄúProud of Your Boy‚Äù \\"once again has pride of place in the story of a boy who finally became all that a mother could wish for in a son.\\" Highlighting \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" as his favorite song to perform in musical, Jacobs explained that Aladdin uses the song to assure his mother \\"I'm going to be the person you want me to be, and make you proud\\", Jacobs credits the ballad with \\"ground[ing] my character and (it) carries me through the whole show.\\" Actor Telly Leung shared Jacob's sentiments, writing the tune offers \\"a great exploration of Aladdin‚Äôs character\\". To prepare for performances of the ballad, Jacobs would draw inspiration from major events that had occurred throughout his life. At times he found it a challenge to transition from having his character evade capture by running and jumping in the previous number directly into \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" \\"half-a-minute later\\". He suggested performers of the song build cardio and perform jumping jacks prior to singing it. = Use in Aladdin = Highlighting \\"Aladdin‚Äôs low opinion of himself\\", Nerdist's Amy Ratcliffe summarized \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" saying \\"how Aladdin thinks he‚Äôs a screw-up but also believes he‚Äôll turn things around and make his mom proud\\". She believes it provides undiscovered insight into the character's background and family. \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" is one of three Ashman-Menken songs not included in the original film to be resurrected for the musical, alongside \\"Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim\\", \\"Call Me a Princess\\" and \\"High Adventure\\". \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" is one of seven songs overall‚Äìboth restored from Menken's previous work and original numbers written specifically for the show ‚Äì heard in the musical. Aladdin now sings in memory of his late mother and reveals his true intentions to make her proud. Further delving into the character's \\"aspirations and insecurities\\", Aladdin is introduced in the musical as homeless and having to resort to stealing food to survive. Remembering a vow he made to himself following her death, Aladdin seeks forgiveness from his mother and promises to \\"go straight as a street entertainer\\" and ultimately make her proud as opposed to being a \\"worthless street rat\\". Having voiced no such motivation in the animated film, \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" serves as Aladdin's \\"I want\\" song in the show and offers \\"a dimension of Aladdin that we don‚Äôt get to see in the cartoon\\" according to London Theatre Direct contributor Nicholas Ephram. The song also establishes Aladdin wishes to be a promise, not only to impress Jasmine, but also please his mother, further clarifying his inherent \\"goodness\\". Director and choreographer Casey Nicholaw explained that \\"When Aladdin sings ‚ÄòProud of Your Boy,‚Äô ... you learn more about him, how he feels like an underdog, how he‚Äôs trying to win the approval of his mother, than you could from just the dialogue.\\" The song is adapted into Aladdin's recurring theme throughout the rest of the musical. The film's first act concludes with Aladdin wishing to be a prince and reprising \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". Despite a second act reprise, Aladdin's mother is not mentioned again. Jasmine's solo \\"These Palace Walls\\" corresponds to \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". Beth Deitchman of D23 believes the song \\"has become a powerful part of\\" the musical. Beguelin described \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" as \\"one of those songs that I think everyone can relate to because at some point, no matter how horrible your relationship with your family is, you do want to make your parents proud.\\" Both Beguelin and Ashman identify as gay; although Beguelin preferred not to speak on behalf of the latter, he admitted \\"for me, there is another level to it being gay, that moment when you realize and you wonder what your parents are going to think.\\"  Composition  According to the song's official sheet music by Walt Disney Music Publishing, \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" is a solemn power ballad performed \\"With determination\\" in the key of D Major. Jacobs' vocal range on the song spans one octave, from E3 to F#4. The track has a duration of two minutes and twenty seconds. Sara Franks-Allen of ScreenCrush described the ballad as bittersweet, while Soundtrack.net's Dan Goldwasser deemed it \\"tender\\". The song is performed in the range of a tenor, the vocals for which Elizabeth Marie Himchak of The San Diego Union-Tribune called \\"soulful\\". A \\"traditional stripped-down solo\\", the track's instrumentation features orchestration. Menken's demo featured on Aladdin's special edition soundtrack, which Heather Phares of AllMusic described as \\"an earnest ballad in the style of 'A Whole New World',\\" spans two minutes and twenty-nine seconds. \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" is about the relationship between a son and his mother. Christian Ziebarth of Animated Views wrote that the song's poignancy \\"personifies every child‚Äôs desire to make their mother proud.\\" Its lyrics begin \\"Proud of your boy, I'll make you proud of your boy\\", with Aladdin apologizing to his mother for being \\"one rotten kid\\" and \\"a louse and a loafer\\". Identifying it as Aladdin's most emotional song, Ratcliffe believes its lyrics are relatable to \\"anyone who‚Äôs ever suffered from imposter syndrome or experienced general feelings of inadequacy\\". The song's lyrics include \\"I'll do my best, what else can I do? / Since I wasn't born perfect like Dad or you / Mom, I will try to Try hard to make you / Proud of your boy‚Äù, promising to \\"turn over a new leaf and end his 'screwin‚Äô-up times'.\\" Muthi Achadiat Kautsar of The Jakarta Post said the track depicts \\"a young man‚Äôs reassurance to his mother that he will be a good man, despite how bad he'd been and how he‚Äôd wasted time.\\" Jacobs said the song adopts an entirely \\"new meaning\\" following the births of his own children and death of his grandmother, expounding that he now \\"see[s] how she would've felt about her son.\\" Believing \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" \\"packs an enormous emotional punch,\\" Menken observed that men particularly appear to relate \\"deeply\\" because \\"many of us go through a phase when we are disappointing our parents, or we think we are.\\" Actor Graeme Isaako, who played Aladdin in international and touring productions, agreed that \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" is particularly relatable, observing that it can pertain to various situations such as losing one's parents, changing careers or simply \\"going on a different journey\\". The lyrics are considered to be among the most personal of Ashman's career. As a gay man himself, Beguelin believes the song's lyrics have ‚Äúanother level to it [related to] being gay...and wondering what your parents are going to think of you.‚Äù Reception Reviewing Ashman and Menken's demo, Heather Phares of AllMusic described the song as \\"intriguing\\" and Menken's vocals as \\"effective\\". Filmtracks.com offered a mixed opinion; although the critic said the addition is \\"interesting to a degree,\\" they found its appearance insignificant due to its availability on previous releases. However, the critic described \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" as \\"a strong enough ballad that it should have made the final picture, reflecting Menken at his best\\". Comingsoon.net's Scott Chitwood found the demo inferior to the film's surviving songs, but appreciated learning about its creators' \\"emotional attachment\\" and described it as a \\"good song\\" nonetheless. Nerdist contributor Amy Ratcliffe wrote that the song's lyrics and music \\"deliver an emotional jab.\\" Reviewing the film's 2004 DVD, Susan King of the Los Angeles Times hailed \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" as a \\"high point\\" among the disc's bonus content, describing it as \\"a beautiful, haunting tune\\". Nathan Cone of Texas Public Radio deemed the track \\"wonderful\\", while Movieweb's Brian B. called it a \\"lost gem\\". The song is considered a cult favorite. The Mississauga News reported that \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" became a cult favorite when it was included on The Music Behind the Magic, writing that the stage production additionally restored it \\"to wonderful effect.\\" Kathi Scrizzi Driscoll of the Cape Cod Times hailed the ballad as the musical's most successful new addition to the musical for \\"add[ing] a depth of feeling\\". New York Theatre Guide described it as a \\"beautifully poignant ballad\\" for Aladdin. Sharon Eberson of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette agreed that the \\"touching\\" ballad is the musical's best song. Newsday writer Linda Winer called the song \\"endearing\\" and the musical's central new addition. Business Insider's Claire Tan reviewed actor Graeme Isaako's \\"beautiful\\" rendition as \\"a poignant insight into Aladdin‚Äôs backstory\\". The Signal Tribune's Anita W. Harris agreed that the number \\"add[s] more poignancy to his character than in the film.\\" Alexandra Heilbron of Tribute described the ballad as \\"a showstopper\\". Chad Jones of TheaterMania called the song \\"effective\\". Emily Nichelle Wolfe of UHCL The Signal described \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" and its reprises as \\"nuanced and emotional without being sappy.\\" Michelle F. Solomon of MiamiArtZine identified \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" as \\"Aladdin's vocal moment to wow the audience\\", while Garrett Southerland of Talkin' Broadway called it a \\"standout among these [new] additions\\". San Diego Magazine's Dan Letchworth called the ballad the best of the musical's restored songs. Praising Jacob's performance, David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the actor imbues his rendition with tenderness and warmth. Identifying the number as a highlight of the musical, Misha Davenport of BroadwayWorld said that Jacobs \\"does some emotional-charged vocal work in the song and its inclusion adds another layer to the character beyond just getting rich and falling in love.\\" Davenport also believes the song features some of Ashman's best lyrics. News & Review's Tessa Marguerite Outland found actor Clinton Greenspan particularly \\"flawless\\" during his emotional rendition of \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". Cristy Meiners of the Deseret News commended Greenspan's vocals for \\"conveying a young man struggling to discover himself\\", particularly during \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". The Times of San Diego's Pat Launer was grateful to the ballad for \\"offset[ting]\\" the show's \\"busy, frenzied scenes\\". Writing for LEO Weekly, Annie Bush reported that several audience members \\"not-so-subtly wiped the corners of their eyes\\" during \\"Proud of Your Boy\\". However, Emma Presnell, writing for the same publication, found herself missing the musical's larger ensemble musical numbers during the ballad. In a mixed review, Dino-Ray Ramos of Deadline Hollwywood said that audiences are unlikely to leave the show singing \\"Proud of Your Boy\\", despite it being a \\"great addition to an already strong soundtrack\\". Variety said \\"That ballad, written for the film and later cut, is undeniably pretty, but emblematic of one of the problems the show‚Äôs creators need to address. ‚ÄúDisney‚Äôs Aladdin‚Äù has few truly earnest moments ‚Äî so few that they feel out of place; they deflate next to the buoyant hijinks bracketing them. Either the transitions between the two need to be massaged or the show needs to go all-in with broad comedy and leave the tearjerking for another day.\\" Vulture.com's Jesse Green was bored by the song, deeming it a \\"snore\\", and found its reprise particularly inconsequential. Margaret Gray of the Los Angeles Times found the ballad unneeded. Dismissing \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" as \\"filler\\", The Spectrum's Samantha Vargas cited the song as an example of the show's pacing issues, observing that Aladdin‚Äôs mother is never mentioned after the song's reprise. Although C. Edwards of Cartoon Brew agreed that \\"It‚Äôs nice to see Aladdin ... finally get to sing the song to his mother\\", Edwards found it unfortunate that \\"he sings it to her in absentia, because she is dead\\", joking, \\"poor lady just can‚Äôt seem to catch a break.\\" Salt Lake Magazine's Jen Hill found the song's message \\"odd\\" within the context of the musical, feeling Aladdin should have been focused on proving things to himself.  Live performances and covers  Singer Clay Aiken covered \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" for the film's 2004 special edition DVD release, which he also used to promote his debut headlining tour the same year. In 2016, Kane sang \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" prior to the main performance of \\"The Little Mermaid in Concert\\" at the Hollywood Bowl. Jacobs sang \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" at a gala hosted by Theatre Development Fund in honor of Disney Theatrical Productions. Menken has performed the song live on several occasions. \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" was the first song Menken performed during his set for Billboard's \\"Billboard on Broadway\\" series in 2017. From 2017 to 2019, Menken regularly performed \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" throughout his A Whole New World of Alan Menken concerts, typically as an encore. Menken dedicated the song to Ashman in his 2017 performance at the D23 Expo, about which D23 contributor Courtney Potter wrote now \\"holds a special place in our hearts\\". Menken's 2019 performance at the Auditorium Theatre coincided with the recent deaths of his own parents, using \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" to pay tribute to both them and Ashman. In 2019, actor Clinton Greenspan sang \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" during A Musical Celebration of Aladdin at the D23 Expo, prior to taking over the title role on Broadway himself. Singer Clay Aiken recorded an orchestral cover of \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" for Aladdin's 2004 platinum edition DVD release, the music video for which interpolates storyboard drawings and sketches. The video stars Aiken singing in a recording studio accompanied by a live orchestra, while excerpts from the film play in the background. Scott Chitwood of Comingsoon.net described Aiken's voice as \\"perfect for the tune\\" and observed that Menken appears content with his performance throughout. Animation World Network's Bill Desowitz wrote that Aiken's rendition offers \\"a glimpse at a more intimate vision of\\" Aladdin's character. Michael Sheridan of Tail Slate cited \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" as \\"the only time I will give Clay Aiken any good notices\\", explaining that the cover exhibits the singer's strengths: \\"He has a powerful voice, one ideally suited for Broadway, and he delivers this tune with softness and strength that is honestly outstanding.\\" Similarly, DVD Talk's Geoffrey Kleinman was \\"extremely impressed\\" by the cover despite not being a fan of the artist, writing, \\"It's a fantastic song\\" with which Aiken \\"does an impressive job\\". In addition to a \\"making-of\\" featurette starring Aiken and Menken, the DVD also includes rough storyboard animation accompanied by Ashman and Menken's \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" demo, as well as an option to watch the original story reel with Aiken's vocals. The cover was also included on the compilation album Disneymania 3 (2005), which AllMusic's Heather Phares described as \\"sweetly traditional\\". Disney-owned distributor Buena Vista Pictures had agreed to sponsor Aiken's first headlining tour, during which all 50 concerts opened with a video montage of Aiken's \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" cover. Buena Vista also used \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" to promote both the DVD and their arrangement with Aiken, which is considered the first sponsorship deal of its kind. Although Disney discussed including Aiken's cover on future soundtrack re-releases, they did not confirm a single release. In 2014, actor and singer Darren Criss performed the song during ABC's television special Backstage with Disney on Broadway: Celebrating 20 Years. Accompanying himself on guitar, the artist's rendition has been described as \\"par[ed] down from its more orchestral Broadway version\\" but remains \\"beautifully plaintive\\". Entertainment Weekly's Esther Zuckerman predicted that Criss' rendition will offer \\"even more exposure\\". Impact The song has since established itself as one of the musical's signature songs. Most audiences and listeners were first introduced to \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" via the musical, becoming \\"a staple of\\" the stage adaptation, according to Insider's Kirsten Acuna several years after it was written. However, even prior to the song's use on stage, \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" had already become popular among the theater industry and a favorite for auditions. Meken recalled that the song was initially circulated among auditions, describing it as \\"this secret thing and people would perform it\\", prompting 680 News to deem it an \\"underground sensation in its own respect‚Äù. ShowTickets.com ranked the song among \\"The 10 Best Musical Numbers from Disney's Stage Musicals\\", commending it for allowing audiences an opportunity to empathize with the title character. BroadwayWorld's Aaron Kaburick described \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" as \\"perfect for any Disney audition\\", ranking it among 20 best baritone audition songs. Actor Telly Leung said the song \\"found new life in the stage production.\\" There was speculation about whether the song would be included in the then-upcoming live-action adaption of the film. Jackson McHenry of Vulture.com joked that fans of the song will riot if it is not included, which he wrote \\"empirically bangs\\" in the musical. Although the song itself was ultimately not included in the film, excerpts were interpolated into its score.

Since 1994 its hotels have been adult-only. History Captain Harry Warner opened Northney Holiday Camp at Hayling Island in 1932, this camp would eventually close for housing development. In 1937 he opened Coronation Holiday Camp, now known as Lakeside Coastal Village, and purchased Sinah Warren in the 1960s. Warner Holidays purchased Mill Rythe Holiday Camp, formally known as Sunshine Holiday Camp and owned by Butlins, which is now owned by AwayResorts. Seaton Holiday Camp was merged with the neighbouring Blue Waters Camp in the 1990s to become Lyme Bay Holiday camp. After initial adult-only offerings at Bembridge, Corton and Lakeside (with their other camps remaining family oriented) Warner Holidays became a completely adult-only brand in 1994. Mill Rythe, Lyme Bay and Harcourt Sands (Originally Puckpool and St. Clare camps) were transferred to Haven Holidays in the mid 1990s. All three were later sold off by with Lyme Bay and Harcourt Sands closing down in the early 2000s. Warner also had camps at Minster-on-Sea on the Isle of Sheppey and Dovercourt, where Hi-de-Hi! was filmed. During the 1990s it also had a brochure for Warner self-catering sites. In 2000 Bourne Holidays Limited bought the Rank Group's holidays division, which consisted of the Warner, Butlins and Haven Holidays brands. Bourne Leisure is privately owned. List of hotels =Nidd Hall Hotel= Nidd Hall Hotel is a Grade II-listed mansion near Harrogate, Yorkshire. Set in 45 acres of parkland, the building dates back to the 1820s.

The hotel opened in 2000 with grounds consisting of 30 acres of gardens. Thoresby Hall is a part of the Dukeries ‚Äì a tract of forest belonging to the Dukes of Portland and Newcastle, and the house‚Äôs original owner, Earl Manvers. =Corton Coastal Village= Corton Coastal Village, in Corton, Suffolk, was originally part of the Colman Estate; at the end of the 19th century Jeremiah Colman built a house called The Clyffe. Warner bought part of the estate in 1946 and began to develop it as a modern coastal holiday village. Developments took place in 2012 with new rooms and landscaping. The village consists of chalets, beach gardens and lawns overlooking the coast. =Gunton Hall Coastal Village= Gunton Hall Coastal Village consists of chalets built around the Grade II-listed Gunton Hall that stands in 55 acres of grounds close to the Suffolk coastal town of Lowestoft. Architect Matthew Brettingham designed the 18th-century manor hall. In 1810 the new owner, Thomas Fowler, set about building the smaller New Hall, which now serves as a reception building. =Sinah Warren Hotel= Sinah Warren Hotel, at Sinah, Hayling Island near Portsmouth, has been a Warner site since being purchased in the 1960s. =Lakeside= Lakeside consists of chalets located on the coast of Hayling Island. Opened as Coronation Holiday Camp and renovated and renamed in the 1980s as Lakeside Holiday Centre. =Bembridge Coast Hotel= Bembridge Coast Hotel is on the eastern shore of the Isle of Wight, overlooking the Solent. The hotel was originally a house built in 1905 named Fuzze Freeze, but during World War II it was taken over by the Admiralty and named HMS Blazer. After the war the site became a private home and then a Yellands Chalet Hotel before it was bought by Warner in 1965 and subsequently opened as an adults- only hotel in 1979. =Norton Grange Coastal Village= Located on the Isle of Wight, Norton Grange was built in 1760, and has been a holiday destination since the 1930s, except from a spell as an operational base for the Admiralty during World War II.

It was known as Yarmouth Holiday Camp for a number of years before being renamed as Norton Grange in the 1990s. =Cricket St Thomas Hotel= Cricket St Thomas Hotel is a conversion of a Grade II- listed Regency mansion set in a valley in Somerset. The grounds were designed by a student of Capability Brown and the site itself has strong links with British naval history, including being the home of Admiral Lord Rodney, and later Alexander Hood. The house was converted into a hotel in the late 20th century. =Littlecote House Hotel= Littlecote House Hotel in Berkshire is a Grade I-listed Tudor property with 113 acres of gardens which was bought by Warner in 1996. The first Littlecote House was built by the de Calstone family in the 14th century. Their descendant, Sir George Darrel, expanded the mansion in the 1500s. It was later rebuilt by Sir John Popham in the 1590s. Littlecote House is home to the Jerusalem Stairs, the Dutch Parlour, a secret passage behind the library bookcase, and the rooms where the D-Day landings were planned. Within the grounds are a Roman mosaic and the remains of Littlecote Roman Villa. =Holme Lacy House Hotel= Holme Lacy House Hotel is a Grade I-listed mansion located in the Wye Valley, near Hereford.

The father of Sir John Williams, first baronet of Bodelwyddan, remodelled the site's original Elizabethan house and raised the mansion. Bodelwyddan Castle was developed after 1830 when battlements, extensions and internal modifications were added by Sir John‚Äôs successors. The site was designed to look like a castle but was requisitioned by the army for nearby Kinmel Barracks where they used to practice trench warfare. The folly was also home to the National Portrait Gallery‚Äôs Victorian collection between 1988 and 2017. =Studley Castle= Studley Castle is a 19th-century country house at Studley, Warwickshire, England. The Grade II* listed building was once owned by the Lyttleton family before being bequeathed by Philip Lyttleton to his niece Dorothy, who married Francis Holyoake. Their son Francis Lyttleton Holyoake, the High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1834, inherited Ribston Hall in Yorkshire from a business partner in 1833 and changed his name to Holyoake-Goodricke. The sale of the Yorkshire property financed the building of a new mansion at Studley. The new house, designed in Gothic Revival style by the architect Samuel Beazley, was completed in 1836. The house was occupied by Studley College between 1903 and the early 1960s and was used as a horticultural training establishment for ladies. It later became offices for the British Leyland and Rover Group car companies. In more recent times the Castle was converted for use as a hotel. After a ¬£50 million refurbishment, it reopened in April 2019 as the 14th hotel in the Warner Leisure Hotels collection.

It started on Monday, 15 November 1824, and lasted for five days, with two major phases. Sequence of events The fire broke out around 10pm on 15 November 1824, in James Kirkwood's engraving workshop on the second floor of the Old Assembly Close, a narrow alleyway just off the High Street.J Grant, Old and New Edinburgh, 1880 fire engines built in 1824 The city of Edinburgh had formed a permanent fire brigade only two months earlier under its new firemaster James Braidwood.James Braidwood biography on Unidiscovered Scotland Although this new force arrived quickly with their custom-built fire engines, they had difficulty locating a water supply and did not begin to tackle the blaze until 11pm, by which time six stories of the building were ablaze. Due to the narrowness of the alleyway, the fire spread quickly to adjoining buildings, first affecting those to the east of Fishmarket Close and later spreading along the roofs of the High Street through embers carried by a southwesterly breeze. By midnight, four tenements were ablaze as the fire advanced towards the Cowgate. The Old Assembly Hall at the centre of the fire (which had given its name to the close) was destroyed during the night. Around midday on Tuesday, 16 November, the spire on the Tron Kirk caught fire and molten lead began to pour from its roof. Although firemen succeeded in reaching the roof of the church, the fierceness of the blaze forced them back. Great Fire of Edinburgh by D O Hill At 10pm on Tuesday evening a secondary outbreak occurred in buildings on the corner of High Street and Parliament Close (renamed Parliament Square after the subsequent rebuilding of the affected area). This blaze started on the top floor of an eleven-story building overlooking the Cowgate. This led to claims of divine intervention and punishment from God, as well as deliberate fire- raising. It was more likely the result of a still smouldering ember. This second phase of the fire began to consume the buildings on the east side of Parliament Close. Efforts focused on saving the adjacent Parliament Hall and Law Courts, and stopping the fire leaping to St Giles Cathedral. A young David Octavius Hill made watercolour sketches during this second phase, viewing the fire from the west. By 5am on Wednesday 19 November, the fire was described as \\"grand and terrific\\". The building housing the Edinburgh Courant collapsed and the fire continued to spread down Conn's Close towards the Cowgate. Due mainly to a downpour of rain, the conflagration was brought under control by Wednesday evening, although small outbreaks continued and final smouldering did not cease until Friday, 21 November. Over the following days, engineers from the castle and navy were employed to pull down the highly unsafe remnants of buildings left precariously balanced along the closes. The fire attracted huge crowds of spectators including a large number of Law Lords: Charles Hope, Lord Granton (Lord President of the Courts); John Boyle of Shewalton (Lord Justice Clerk); Sir William Rae of St Catherines (Lord Advocate); John Hope (Solicitor General, later Lord Hope); the Dean of Faculty; and Henry (later Lord) Cockburn. Total damageHigh Street (Royal Mile): four six-storey tenements fully lost plus upper storeys of buildings closer to the Tron Kirk damaged *Conn's Close: two timber-framed 'lands' (tenements) of great antiquity destroyed completely *Old Assembly Close: four seven-storey tenements lost and the Assembly Hall (a ballroom) *Borthwick‚Äôs Close: six tenements lost *Old Fishmarket Close: four six-storey tenements lost and Neill & Co printworks *Parliament Close: four double tenements of seven to eleven storeys destroyed, including the birthplace of James Boswell *Office of the Edinburgh Courant newspaper destroyed *John Kay's shop in Parliament Close destroyed *Old Assembly Hall destroyed. *Several printworks destroyed *Notable residents who lost their home in the fire included Hector Gavin and Archibald Inglis An estimated 400 homes were destroyed, with 400-500 families left homeless. Thirteen lives were lost including those of two firemen and many people were injured. Historic homes destroyed included that of Robert Dundas of Arniston, the Elder and George Heriot.Cassell's Old and New Edinburgh vol II p.242 Aftermath James Braidwood statue in Parliament Square Amidst mounting public criticism of the new fire brigade and its young firemaster, an inquiry was held after the disaster. Braidwood and his \\"pioneers\\" (as the first firemen were called) were exonerated from all blame. The inquiry found that there had been confusion as to who had been in charge of the firefighting operation. Public officials (Bailies, Law Officers and \\"Gentlemen of Importance\\"), assuming authority under older municipal regulations, were found to have issued contradictory orders to the harassed firemen. This finding prompted the passing of a new regulation whereby the City Firemaster (or, in his absence, his Deputy) was to be given complete command of all firefighting operations, a ruling subsequently adopted throughout Britain's fire services. The inquiry also criticised the inadequate number of firecocks that had been available to the firefighters and recommended improvements. Within a year the number for the whole town was increased from 45 to 97, with 88 more following later. The brigade was also fully re-equipped. The fire opened the way for a more formal completion of the Scottish Law Courts in Parliament Square. This had been proposed as early as 1807, but blocked since 1810 by owners on the east side of the square. The fire destroyed the buildings they had been trying to retain and may have been viewed as a \\"happy accident\\". The remodelling of the buildings was completed to the original plan in 1829. The south side of the Royal Mile from the Tron Kirk to Parliament Square was rebuilt as a planned run of well-proportioned but plain five-storey Georgian tenements. Some of the eastern blocks, which suffered less fire damage, incorporated some earlier fabric such as turret stairs.J Gifford, C McWilliam, D Walker, The Buildings of Scotland, Edinburgh, Penguin 1984 The rebuilt section of the High Street incorporated a new central fire station, now a police museum. St. Giles Cathedral was refaced in ashlar a few years later (1829‚Äì33), partly to repair and conceal major scorching from the fire. The steeple of the Tron Kirk was rebuilt in 1828, ignoring its earlier Dutch design. Braidwood statue In 2008, a statue of James Braidwood, master of the newly formed Edinburgh fire brigade which had fought the fire, was unveiled in Parliament Square. The spot was chosen to mark the stand made by the fire brigade to save St Giles Cathedral from more serious damage. The statue was created by the Glasgow sculptor, Kenneth Mackay, and paid for from a fund set up by the late Dr Frank Rushbrook CBE, then 93-year-old former Firemaster at Lothian & Borders Fire Brigade.

Trained under Baul gurus, Sanatan Das Baul, Shashanko Goshai Baul in Bengal, she has been performing both in India and other countries since 1995. She is married to Ravi Gopalan Nair, a noted Pava Kathakali glove puppet artist, and is based in Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, since 1997, where she also runs, \\"Ektara Baul Sangeetha Kalari\\" a school for Baul music. Early life and background PARVATHY AT KOLKATA, 2015 Parvathy Baul was born as Mousumi Parial, in a traditional Bengali Brahmin family in West Bengal. Her family was originally from East Bengal, and migrated to West Bengal after the partition of India. Her father, an engineer with the Indian Railways, was keen on Indian classical music and often took his daughter to concerts. Her mother, a housewife, was a devotee of mystic saint Ramakrishna. Due to her father's posting at various locations in the region, she grew up in Assam, Cooch Behar, and bordering areas of West Bengal. She passed higher secondary examination from Suniti Academy, Cooch Behar. In her early years, she learnt Kathak, a classical dance, from Srilekha Mukherjee. She received training as a visual artist at Kala Bhavan, an art school at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. Though she received her early music training in Hindustani classical music, it was on a train to Santiniketan campus, that she first heard a blind Baul singer, performing the traditional music of mystic minstrels from Bengal. This was followed by meeting Phulmala Dashi, a woman Baul singer who frequented the campus. Soon, she started learning music from Phulmala and also visited several Baul ashrams, later Phulamala advised her to find another teacher. During this period, she watched a performance by Sanatan Das Baul, an 80-year-old Baul singer from the Bankura in West Bengal. Deciding to learn from him, she visited his ashram in Sonamukhi in Bankura district. After 15 days, she received her diksha initiation from him, and he became her first guru. For the next seven years, she travelled with her guru, providing vocal support during performances, learning Baul songs, Baul dance, and playing ektara and duggi, a small kettle-drum strapped to the waist. Finally, he allowed her to sing on her own and soon she was led to her next guru Shashanko Goshai Baul. Goshai, who was 97-year-old at the time and lived in Khoirboni, a small village in the Bankura district. He was initially hesitant to take on a female disciple, thus tested her dedication for a few days, before taking her on. In the remaining three years of his life, he taught her numerous songs, and intricacies of the Baul tradition. Career Though, she started performing in 1995, in 1997 she came to Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, to learn about local spiritual and theatre traditions. Here she met Ravi Gopalan Nair, an Andi Pandaram ‚Äì a traditional puppeteer from Kerala, who also makes glove puppets or Pava Kathakali. She learnt Grotowski technique used in theatre for him, and in 2000 travelled with him to Bread and Puppet Theater in Vermont, US to study with creator Peter Schumann, known for incorporating puppetry, live-art into theatre performances. Prior to this they worked with the theatre company for five months during Seven Basic Needs exhibition and performances at Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany, In Thiruvananthapuram, she also met Abdul Salam, a Muslim fakir kalandar, who became her guru, with him she found her musical calling and who taught her about the spiritual meaning of the tradition. Parvati Baul performing at Bharat Bhavan Bhopal India 2017 Parvathy Baul in concert Thereafter, in 2001, she decided to devote full-time to Baul tradition, and started performing Baul music, also playing ektara and a duggi as accompanying musical instruments, and the tinkling chilambu nupur metallic anklets. She performs mystic songs both from tradition Baul repertoire and her own doha couplets. She uses elements of theatre and cantastoria or sung stories into her performances by acting out the lyrics or at times adding explanatory speeches in English. Inspired by pattachitra, scroll painters and traditional story-tellers of Bengal, she adds visual elements to performance through painted backdrops. In some her performances, inspired by a work with Schumann, she paints large canvases along with her singing, illustrating the themes of her songs as a live performance art. In late 1990s, she married her teacher Ravi Gopalan Nair, and has been living in Thiruvananthapuram for the last 15 years. She also runs an \\"Ektara Baul Sangeetha Kalari\\", a Baul music gurukul (school) at Nedumangad near Thiruvananthapuram. Yet, like the traditional Baul singers of Bengal, she continues to perform live in remote villages of Kerala, at soir√©es hosted by local villagers, and also in her native Bengal. Once a year, she also travels to teach Baul music at the International School of Theatre Anthropology (ISTA). In 2005, she published Songs of the Great Soul, a book about her journey into the Baul tradition, provides a rare insight into an educated woman foray into the tradition, which has been male preserve and mostly flourished in rural areas, where women were often caregivers and companions to Bauls at ashrams, few took to singing and the itinerant lifestyle. Over the years, she performed at various concerts all over India and other countries, including at Ruhaniyat ‚Äì The All India Sufi & Mystic Music Festival and One Billion Rising.

She is considered to be the first woman medical physicist. Early life and family Edith Stoney was born at 40 Wellington Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin; the daughter of George Johnstone Stoney, FRS, an eminent physicist who coined the term electron in 1891 as the ‚Äòfundamental unit quantity of electricity‚Äô, and his wife and cousin, Margaret Sophia Stoney. One of her two brothers, George Gerald, was an engineer and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). One of her two sisters, Florence Stoney, was a radiologist and received an OBE. Her cousin was the Dublin-based physicist George Francis FitzGerald FRS (1851‚Äì1901), and her uncle Bindon Blood Stoney FRS was Engineer of Dublin Port, renowned for building a number of the main Dublin bridges, and developing the Quayside. Edith Stoney demonstrated considerable mathematical talent and gained a scholarship at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she achieved a First in the Part I Tripos examination in 1893. However, she was not awarded a University of Cambridge degree as women were excluded from graduation until 1948. During her time at Newnham, she was in charge of the College telescope. She was later awarded a BA and an MA from Trinity College, Dublin, after they accepted women in 1904. After briefly working on gas turbine calculations and searchlight design for Sir Charles Algernon Parsons, she took a mathematics teaching post at the Cheltenham Ladies‚Äô College. London (Royal Free) School of Medicine for Women Following the 1876 Medical Act, it was illegal for academic institutions to prevent access to medical education based on gender. The first medical school for women in Britain was established in 1874 by Dr Sophia Jex-Blake in anticipation of this law. The London School of Medicine for Women quickly became part of the University of London, with clinical teaching at the Royal Free Hospital. Edith's sister Florence was a student at the school, she graduated in medicine with honours in 1895 (MB BS) and obtained her MD in 1898. Meanwhile, Edith gained an appointment as a physics lecturer at the school in 1899. Her first tasks were to set up a physics laboratory and design the physics course. The laboratory was planned for 20 students, and the course content was pure physics, as required by university regulations; it included mechanics, magnetism, electricity, optics, sound, heat and energy. In her Lancet Obituary, an ex-student of hers noted: ‚ÄúHer lectures on physics mostly developed into informal talks, during which Miss Stoney, usually in a blue pinafore, scratched on a blackboard with coloured chalks, turning anxiously at intervals to ask ‚ÄòHave you taken my point?‚Äô. She was perhaps too good a mathematician ‚Ä¶ to understand the difficulties of the average medical student, but experience had taught her how distressing these could be‚Äù. In 1901, the Royal Free Hospital appointed Florence into a new part-time position of medical electrician. The following April, the two sisters opened a new x-ray service in the electrical department During their time at the Royal Free Hospital, the two sisters actively supported the women's suffrage movement, though opposed the direct violent action with which it was later associated. During her time at the school, she also played a central role in the British Federation of University Women (BFUW). She was elected treasurer, in her absence, at the first executive meeting on 9 October 1909, a position that she held until the end of May 1915. She became increasingly engaged with the political lobbying of the Federation. At the executive meeting on 19 October 1912, she proposed the names of two members for a subcommittee to secure the passing into law of a bill to enable women to become barristers, solicitors or parliamentary agents. The legislation was eventually enacted after the war within the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919. Edith Stoney resigned her post at the school in March 1915 and it was recorded that ‚Äòwith due regret and most unwillingly a change is desirable in the physics lectureship‚Äô. Edith Stoney was offered ¬£300 on tendering her resignation. World War I Map locating the different Field Hospitals where Edith Anne Stoney worked during WWI. Map represent borders in 1914 Both Florence and Edith offered their services to the British Red Cross at the War Office in London, to provide a radiological service to support the troops in Europe, on the day Britain declared war. Their offer was refused, because they were women. Florence set up her own unit with the Women's Imperial Service League and spent the next 6 months in Europe. Edith organised supplies from London where she also served on the League's committee. Florence returned to London at the time Edith resigned from the London School of Medicine for Women. Edith contacted the Scottish Women's Hospitals (SWH), an organisation formed in 1914 to give medical support in the field of battle and financed by the women's suffrage movement. The organisation had gained agreement to set up a new 250-bed tented hospital at Domaine de Chanteloup, Sainte-Savine, near Troyes (France), funded by the Cambridge women's colleges of Girton and Newnham and it became Edith's role to plan and operate the x-ray facilities. She established stereoscopy to localise bullets and shrapnel and introduced the use of x-rays in the diagnosis of gas gangrene, interstitial gas being a mandate for immediate amputation to give any chance of survival. The hospital was near the front line and, in her own words, by September 1915, ‚Äòthe town had been evacuated, the station had been mined, and we heard the heavy guns ever going at night time‚Äô. The unit was entirely female, except for two part- time male drivers, and her technical assistant, Mr Mallett.Edith Stoney's medals held at Newnham College, Cambridge. From left to right: British War Medal (reverse), Victory Medal (obverse), Serbian Order of St Sava (reverse), French Croix de Guerre (reverse) and French ‚ÄúM√©daille des √©pid√©mies\\" (reverse). They were assigned to the Corps Exp√©ditionnaire d‚ÄôOrient and order to move to Serbia. After boarding the steamship Mossoul in Marseille, they reached Salonika (known as Thessaloniki in modern Greece) on 3 November, where they took the night train north to Ghevgheli (now Gevgelija in modern Republic of Macedonia), on the Serbian side of the Greek border. They set up a hospital in an unused silk factory where they treated 100 patients with injuries ranging from frostbite to severe lung and head wounds. Following defeats at the hands of Bulgarian forces, Edith and her staff retreated to Salonika by 6 December 1916. Eleven days later, they had re-established the hospital on a drained low swamp by the sea, and by New Year's Day 1917 Edith had the lights on and the x-rays working. Despite the lack of equipment and resources, she established an electrotherapy department and various equipments for the muscular rehabilitation of the soldiers in their care. She also assisted with problems on two British hospital ships, on which the x-ray systems had been damaged during a storm, and gave support to the SWH unit in Ostrovo (now Arnissa on Lake Vegoritida formerly lake Ostrovo in Northern Greece ), which arrived during September 1916. She had a break for sick leave in December 1917 and returned until the following summer. She applied for an appointment as an army camp radiologist in Salonika, but her demand was blocked by the War Office. In October 1917, she returned to France to lead the x-ray departments at the SWH hospitals of Royaumont and Villers-Cotter√™ts. In March 1918, she had to supervise a camp closure and retreat for the third time, when Villers- Cotter√™ts was overrun by the German troops. During the final months of the war the fighting intensified and there was a steep increase in workload; in the month of June alone the x-ray workload peaked at over 1,300, partly because of an increased use of fluoroscopy. Her war service was recognised by several countries, and she was awarded the ‚ÄúM√©daille des √©pid√©mies du minist√®re de la Guerre‚Äù and the Croix de Guerre from France, the Order of St Sava from Serbia, and the Victory and British War Medals from Britain. Post-war and retirement From left to right: Edith Stoney (left), with her sister Florence and father Johnstone On returning to England, Edith Stoney took a post as lecturer in physics in the Household and Social Science department at King's College for Women which she held until retirement in 1925. After leaving King's she moved to Bournemouth, where she lived with her sister Florence, who was suffering from spinal cancer (and died in 1932). During her retirement, she resumed her work with the BFUW for which she had acted as the first treasurer before the war. She became one of the earliest (and oldest) members of the Women's Engineering Society and played an active part in the organisation until shortly before her death. She travelled widely and, in 1934, she spoke to the Australian Federation of University Women on the subject of women in engineering, highlighting the contribution made by women workers during the war. In 1936, she established the Johnstone and Florence Stoney Studentship in the BFUW, for ‚Äòresearch in biological, geological, meteorological or radiological science undertaken preferably in Australia, New Zealand or South Africa‚Äô. The studentship is now administered by Newnham College, Cambridge, and supports clinical medical students going abroad for their elective period. The declaration of Trust was dated 11 February 1942 and the Johnstone And Florence Stoney Studentship Fund Charity (no. 273043) was registered on 25 Mar 1976. Edith Stoney died on 25 June 1938,at age 69, and obituaries were printed in both the scientific and medical press - Nature, The Lancet The Woman Engineer and national newspapers in England, The Times and Australia.  Legacy  Stoney was remembered for her considerable bravery and resourcefulness in the face of extreme danger, and her imagination in contributing to clinical care under the most difficult conditions of war. As a strong advocate of education for women, she enabled young graduate women to spend time on research overseas and another to enable physicists to enter medical school thanks to the fund she created. Through her work and engagements, Edith Stoney was remembered as a pioneer of medical physics.

In the modern Republic of Cyprus, they are recognized as one of the three minority \\"religious groups\\" along with the Maronites and Latins. Byzantine Era (578‚Äì1191) Solidus of Emperor Maurice There is a long link between the Armenians and Cyprus, possibly dating back to the 5th century BC. However, Armenians have had a continuous documented presence in Cyprus since 578 AD: according to historian Theophylact Simocatta, during his campaign against the Persian King Chosroes I, Byzantine General (and future Emperor) Maurice the Cappadocian captured 10,090 Armenians as prisoners in Arzanene (Aghdznik), of whom about 3,350 were deported to Cyprus. Judging by the strategic position of the colonies they established (Armenokhori, Arminou, Kornokipos, Patriki, Platani, Spathariko and perhaps Mousere), it is very likely that these Armenians served Byzantium as mercenary soldiers and frontiersmen. More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor Heraclius (610‚Äì641) for political reasons (he attempted to bridge the differences between the Armenian Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church), during the pontificate of Catholicos Hovhannes III Odznetsi (717‚Äì728) for commercial reasons and after the liberation of Cyprus from the Arab raids by patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes (965) for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere (868‚Äì874), Basil Haigaz (958), Vahram (965), Elpidios Brachamios (1075‚Äì1085) and Leo Symbatikes (910‚Äì911), who undertook the construction of Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an Armenian Apostolic church in the 10th century and was used by Armenian-Catholics during the Latin Era as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos Khatchig I established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia. Relations between Cyprus and the Armenians became closer when the Kingdom of Cilicia was established. The Kingdom, on the coast of Cilicia to the north of the island, was established at around 1080 AD by Armenian refugees who fled the Seljuk invasion to the north and remained an ally of Byzantium. Between 1136 and 1138, Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus moved the entire population of the Armenian city of Tell Hamdun to Cyprus. After Isaac Comnenus' wedding to the daughter of the Armenian prince Thoros II in 1185, Armenian nobles and warriors came with him to Cyprus, many of whom defended the island against Richard the Lionheart (May 1191), when he landed in Limassol in a conquering mood, and the Knights Templar (April 1192), who had purchased Cyprus from Richard and governed with a particular cruelty. Eventually, the Templars returned the island to Richard, who in turn sold it to Guy de Lusignan. Latin Era (1191‚Äì1570) Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca After the purchase of Cyprus by titular Frankish King of Jerusalem Guy de Lusignan in 1192, in his attempt to establish a western-type feudal kingdom, the latter sent emissaries to Europe, Cilicia and the Levant, resulting in a massive immigration of Armenians and other peoples from Western Europe, Cilicia and the Levant (mainly Franks, Latins and Maronites, as well as Copts, Ethiopians, Georgians, Jacobites, Jews, Melkites, Nestorians and others). To these numerous bourgeois, noblemen, knights and warriors, fiefs, manors, lands, offices and various privileges were bounteously granted. Because of their proximity, their commercial ties and a series of royal and nobility marriages, the Kingdom of Cyprus and the Kingdom of Cilicia became inextricably linked. In the subsequent centuries, thousands of Cilician Armenians sought refuge in Cyprus fleeing the Muslim attacks: the Fall of Antioch (1268), the Fall of Acre (1291), the attack of the Saracens (1322), the Mameluke attacks (1335 and 1346) and the Ottoman occupation of Cilicia (1403 and 1421). Cyprus became now the easternmost bulwark of Christianity; in 1441 the authorities of Famagusta invited Armenians from Cilicia to settle there. The Fall of Sis in April 1375 put an end to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia; its last King, Levon V, was granted safe passage to Cyprus and died in exile in Paris in 1393, after calling in vain for another Crusade. In 1396, his title and privileges were transferred to his cousin, King James I de Lusignan, in the Saint Sophia cathedral; subsequently, the royal crest of the Lusignan dynasty also bore the lion of Armenia. Thus ended the last fully independent Armenian entity of the Middle Ages, after nearly three centuries of sovereignty and bloom; the title of \\"King of Armenia\\" was then held through the centuries down to the modern day by the House of Savoy, through the marriage of Queen Charlotte of Cyprus to Louis of Savoy. Although the Egyptian Mamelukes had taken over Cilicia, they were unable to maintain their hold on it; Turkic tribes eventually made their way to the region and established themselves there, leading to the conquest of Cilicia by Tamerlane. As a result, 30,000 Armenians left Cilicia in 1403 and settled in Cyprus, which continued to be ruled by the Lusignan dynasty until 1489. During the Frankish and the Venetian Eras (1192‚Äì1489 and 1489‚Äì1570, respectively) there were Armenian churches in Nicosia, Famagusta, Spathariko [Sourp Sarkis (Saint Sergius) and Sourp Varvare (Saint Barbara)], Kornokipos [Sourp Hreshdagabedk (Saint Archangels)], Platani [Sourp Kevork (Saint George)], Piscopia and elsewhere [Sourp Parsegh (Saint Basil)]. Armenians were amongst the seven most important religious groups in Cyprus, in possession of stores and shops in the ports of Famagusta, Limassol and Paphos, as well as in the capital Nicosia, thus controlling a large segment of commerce. Additionally, Armenian was one of the eleven official languages of the Kingdom of Cyprus and one of the five official languages of the Venetian colonial administration of Cyprus. According to chroniclers Leontios Makhairas (1369‚Äì1458), George Boustronios (1430‚Äì1501) and Florio Bustron (1500‚Äì1570), the Armenians of Nicosia had their own Prelature and used to live in their own quarter, called Armenia or Armenoyitonia. They originally had three churches: Sourp Kevork (Saint George), Sourp Boghos-Bedros (Saints Paul and Peter) and Sourp Khach (Holy Cross) ‚Äì believed to the today's Arablar mosque or Stavros tou Missirikou. In Famagusta, a Bishopric was established in the late 12th century and Armenians lived around the Syrian quarter. Historical documents suggest the presence of an important monastic and theological centre there, at which Saint Nerses Lampronatsi (1153‚Äì1198) is said to have studied; of the three Armenian churches of walled Famagusta [Sourp Asdvadzadzin (Mother of God), Sourp Sarkis (Saint Sergius) and Sourp Khach (Holy Cross) ‚Äì believed to be the unidentified church between the Carmelite church and Saint Anne], only Ganchvor church survives, built in 1346. During the Middle Ages, Armenians in Cyprus were actively engaged in commerce, while some of them formed military garrisons in Kyrenia (1322) and elsewhere. A number of Armenians defended the Frankish Kingdom of Cyprus against the Genoese (1373) at Xeros, against the Saracens (1425) at Stylli village and against the Mamelukes (1426) in Limassol and Khirokitia. By 1425, the renowned Magaravank ‚Äì originally the Coptic monastery of Saint Makarios near Halevga (Pentadhaktylos region) ‚Äì came under Armenian possession, as did sometime before 1504 the Benedictine/Carthusian nunnery of Notre Dame de Tyre or Tortosa (Sourp Asdvadzadzin) in walled Nicosia; many of its nuns had been of Armenian origin (such as princess Fimie, daughter of the Armenian King Hayton II). During the Latin Era, there was also a small number of Armenian Catholics in Nicosia, Famagusta and the Bellapais Abbey, where Lord Hayton of Corycus served as a monk. The prosperity of the inhabitants of Cyprus was brought to a halt by the harsh and corrupt Venetian administration and the iniquitous taxes they imposed. Their tyrannical rule, combined with adverse conditions (droughts, earthquakes, epidemics, famines, floods etc.), caused a noticeable decline in the island's population. According to historian Stephen de Lusignan, by the late Venetian Era, Armenians lived mainly in Famagusta and Nicosia and, in small numbers, at three ‚ÄúArmenian villages‚Äù, Platani, Kornokipos and Spathariko. Ottoman Era (1570‚Äì1878) The Magaravank monastery (1967) During the Ottoman conquest of the island (1570‚Äì1571), about 40,000 Ottoman-Armenian craftsmen were recruited, mainly as sappers. The new order of things affected the Armenian community as well: many of the Ottoman Armenians who survived the conquest settled mainly in Nicosia, increasing its Armenian population, while the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus was recognised as an Ethnarchy (‘±’¶’£’°’µ’´’∂ ‘ª’∑’≠’°’∂’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂, Azkayin Ishkhanoutiun), through the millet institution. However, the Bishopric in Famagusta was abolished, as the Christian population was slaughtered or expelled and the entire walled city became forbidden for non- Muslims until the early years of the British Era. As a reward for their services during the conquest, the Armenians of Nicosia were granted the right to guard Paphos Gate (this privilege was used only for a short period, due to the large expenditure required) and, by a firman dated May 1571, they were given back the Notre Dame de Tyre church (also known as Tortosa), which the Ottomans had turned into a salt store. Additionally, the Magaravank monastery had won the favour of the Ottomans and became an important way station for Armenian and other pilgrims en route to the Holy Land, as well as a place of rest for travellers and Catholicoi and other clergymen from Cilicia and Jerusalem. Contrary to the Latins and the Maronites, Armenians ‚Äì being Orthodox ‚Äì were not persecuted because of their religion by the Ottomans. Even though about 20,000 Armenians lived in Cyprus during the very first years of the Ottoman Era, by 1630 only 2,000 Armenians remained, out of a total of 56,530 inhabitants. In the Bedesten (the covered market of Nicosia), there were many Armenian merchants and in the late 18th century/early 19th century Nicosia's leading citizen was an Armenian trader called Sarkis, who was a ‚Äúberatli‚Äù (bearer of a berat or charter granting a privilege) and was initially the dragoman (interpreter) for the French Consul, before becoming the dragoman for the English Consul. Later on, in the early to mid-19th century, travellers and registers mention another rich Armenian merchant, Hadji Symeon Agha of Crimea, who had earlier financed a complete reparation of the Magaravank and was Sarkis' son-in-law. A third Armenian notable was Mardiros Fugas, dragoman for the French Consul and a well-known trader, who was arrested and beheaded by the Ottomans circa 1825. Gifted with the acumen of industry, Armenians practised lucrative professions and in the beginning of the 17th century Persian Armenians settled in Cyprus as silk traders, as did some affluent Ottoman-Armenians in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Boghos-Berge Agha Eramian. However, with the new order of things, the number of Armenians and other Christians dramatically declined due to the onerous taxation and the harshness of the Ottoman administration, compelling many Christians to become Linobambaki (Crypto-Christians) or to embrace Islam, which explains why former Armenian villages (Armenokhori, Artemi, Ayios Iakovos, Ayios Khariton, Kornokipos, Melounda, Platani and Spathariko) were inhabited by ‚ÄúTurkish-Cypriots‚Äù at the end of the 19th century; a few Armenian-Cypriots became Catholics through marriage with affluent Latin families. Dheftera Gradually, after the bloody 1821 events ‚Äì when, as a response to the Cypriot support to the Greek Revolution, the Ottomans destroyed the Armenian and Greek mansions, prohibited Greeks, Franks, Armenians and Maronites from carrying guns and hanged or massacred 470 notables, amongst them the Armenian parish priest of Nicosia, der Bedros ‚Äì some improvements were observed during the Tanzimat period (1839‚Äì1876). In the spirit of the Hatt-ƒ± ≈ûerif of G√ºlhane (1839), the Armenian Bishop, the Greek Archbishop and the Maronite Suffragan Bishop participated in the Administrative Council (Meclis ƒ∞dare), which was formed in 1840. After 1850, some Armenians were employed in the civil service, while in 1860 the Armenian church of Nicosia became amongst the first in Cyprus to have a belfry ‚Äì donated by Constantinopolitan Armenian Hapetig Nevrouzian. Additionally, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 benefited the Armenian and other merchants of the island, while in 1870 the first Armenian school was established in Nicosia by newly arrived Archimandrite Vartan Mamigonian. Furthermore, as a result of the Hatt-ƒ± H√ºmayun in 1856, the administrative autonomy of the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus was officially recognised. Throughout the Ottoman Era, the vast majority of the Armenian population of Cyprus had been Armenian Orthodox, although there is also mention of a small Armenian Catholic community in Larnaca. Of the three religious groups, the Armenians are the only ones to have a continuous presence of prelates throughout the Ottoman period. Based on various estimates, the Armenian-Cypriot community of the 19th century numbered between 150 and 250 persons, the majority of whom lived in Nicosia, with smaller numbers living in Famagusta, Larnaca, the north and south of the capital (especially in Dheftera and Kythrea) and, naturally, around the Magaravank. British Era (1878‚Äì1960) With the arrival of the British in July 1878 and their progressive administration, the already prosperous yet small Armenian community of the island was particularly strengthened. Known for their linguistic skills, several Armenians were contracted to Cyprus to work as interpreters and public servants at the consulates and the British administration, such as Apisoghom Utidjian ‚Äì the official state translator and interpreter for Ottoman Turkish between 1878 and 1919. The number of Armenians in Cyprus significantly increased following the massive deportations, the massacres and the Genocide perpetrated by the Ottomans and the Young Turks (1894‚Äì1896, 1909 & 1915‚Äì1923). Cyprus welcomed over 10,000 refugees from Cilicia, Smyrna and Constantinople, who arrived in Larnaca and all its other harbours, some by chance, others by intent; about 1,500 of them made the island their new home. Industrious, cultivated and progressive, they brought new life into the old community and did not need long to find their feet and establish themselves as people of the arts, letters and sciences, entrepreneurs and merchants, craftsmen and photographers, as well as professionals who introduced new crafts, dishes and sweets to the island, thus contributing to Cyprus' socioeconomic and cultural development. The newcomers established associations, choirs, sports groups, Scout groups, bands, churches, schools and cemeteries in Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Amiandos and elsewhere, while soon Armenophony became a reality. Armenians were the first locksmiths, mechanics, seat, comb and stamp makers, upholsterers, watchmakers and zincographers in Cyprus. They were the first to introduce the cinema, they significantly improved the craft of shoemaking and it was Armenians who first introduced Armenian bastourma, baklava, dried apricots, gassosa, gyros, halva, ice cubes, koubes, lahmadjoun, lokmadhes and pompes into the Cypriot cuisine ‚Äì all very popular today. Armenians also introduced two techniques of embroidery needlework: the Aintab work (‘±’µ’∂’©’°’∫’´ ’£’∏÷Ä’Æ) and the Marash work (’Ñ’°÷Ä’°’∑’´ ’£’∏÷Ä’Æ). There were also some Armenian factory owners (ice makers, soap makers, sock makers, tanners etc.), but above all, there was a disproportionately large number of Armenian photographers. Law-abiding by nature, Armenian-Cypriots always had a high- profile with the British administration and many became conscientious civil servants and disciplined policemen or were employed at the Cyprus Government Railway and at Cable and Wireless. Throughout the 1920s‚Äì1950s, many worked at the asbestos mines at Amiandos and the copper mines at Mavrovouni and Skouriotissa, some of whom had been trade unionists. Some Armenian-Cypriots participated in the 1897 Greco-Turkish War, the two World Wars (1914‚Äì1918 ‚Äì at the Cyprus Muleteers' Corps ‚Äì & 1939‚Äì1945 ‚Äì both at the Cyprus Regiment and the Cyprus Volunteer Force) and the EOKA liberation struggle (1955‚Äì1959). Also, the Eastern Legion (later called Armenian Legion) was formed and trained between December 1916 and May 1918 in Monarga village, near Boghazi, consisting of over 4,000 Diasporan Armenian volunteers who fought against the Ottoman Empire. Some Armenian refugees arrived from Palestine (1947‚Äì1949) and Egypt (1956‚Äì1957). Following negotiations in September and October 1916, between Boghos Noubar Pasha and French military and political authorities, the Eastern Legion (L√©gion d'Orient/‘±÷Ä’•÷Ç’•’¨’•’°’∂ ‘º’ß’£’ß’∏’∂) was officially established in Cairo in November 1916, by a special charter signed by the French Minister of War, General Pierre August Roques. It was to be an auxiliary unit of the French Army, consisting mainly of Armenian volunteers, whose aim was to liberate Cilicia from the Ottoman Empire, for the purpose of creating an independent Armenian state in that region. After negotiations with the British authorities, within the framework of the Anglo-French intelligence co- operation, it was decided that the training of the volunteers (’Ø’°’¥’°÷Ç’∏÷Ä’∂’•÷Ä=gamavorner) would take place at Monarga, in the Carpass peninsula of Cyprus, near Boghaz. The Legion would be administered by French officers. The camp was built in December 1916 by Armenian Genocide refugees and the arrival of the first volunteers ‚Äì refugees from Musa Dagh ‚Äì started in January 1917. Throughout 1917 and 1918, volunteers arrived at Famagusta harbor from the harbours of Marseilles and Port Said. Several Armenian organisations in the Middle East, Europe and North America supported the Legion, either with financial contributions or by drafting Diasporan Armenians to form companies of the Legion. The selection and training were rather strict, while the exceeding difficulties and large costs of transportation hindered the arrival of more volunteers from the New World. The volunteers were especially impatient to perform their patriotic duty. The camp consisted of the headquarters, the barracks, various auxiliary installations (including a water basin) and a small church. In total, there were 4,124 volunteers, who formed 3 Armenian battalions, as well as 2 Syrian companies (consisting of about 300 men). The camp's commander was Infantry Lieutenant Colonel Louis Romieu, while its spiritual shepherd was Archbishop Taniel Hagopian, assisted by Archimandrite Krikor Bahlavouni, who later became known as ‚ÄúTopal Vartabed‚Äù (‘π’∏÷É’°’¨ ’é’°÷Ä’§’°’∫’•’ø=Lame Archimandrite), because of an injury he suffered during his military service. Both clergymen came to Cyprus from the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, even though at the time the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus was under the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople. In addition to their duties in Cyprus, at some point, the defence of Castellorizo island (to the east of Rhodes) was handed to the Armenian Legion. Basic training was completed by May 1918. Until then, the 1st battalion had about a year and a half of training, the 2nd battalion about eight months and the third battalion was being formed. Then, the largest part of the Legion was moved to Egypt and thence it was deployed to Palestine, marking the Battle of Arara on 19 September 1918. The 3rd battalion left Cyprus in October 1918. In December 1918 the Legion ‚Äì consisting now of 4 battalions, 4,368 soldiers and 66 officers ‚Äì settled in the Cilicia region (with its headquarters located in Adana) as part of the French Mandate, where it remained until it was dissolved in August 1920. In February 1919 it was officially called ‚ÄúArmenian Legion‚Äù (L√©gion Arm√©nienne/’Ä’°’µ’Ø’°’Ø’°’∂ ‘º’ß’£’ß’∏’∂). In mid-1919, General Antranik Ozanian came to Cyprus, wanting to go to Cilicia in order to head the Legion, but this was denied by the French. After its dissolution, only a very small number of legionnaires returned to Cyprus. In the Armenian cemetery of Larnaca there is a group grave of 9 volunteers of the Armenian Legion, commissioned by the French consulate in the late 1940s. In the location where the Legion's camp once was, presently in the Turkish-occupied areas, very few vestiges remain. The Armenian-Cypriot community prospered throughout the British Era (1878‚Äì1960), by establishing associations, choirs, Scout groups, sports teams, musical ensembles, churches, cemeteries and schools, including the renowned Melkonian Educational Institute. In many ways unique across the whole Armenian Diaspora, it was built just outside Nicosia between 1924 and 1926, after the generous and benevolent donation of the Egyptian-Armenian tobacco trading brothers Krikor and Garabed Melkonian, initially in order to shelter and educate 500 orphans of the Genocide, who planted the trees in front of the school in memory of their slaughtered relatives. From an orphanage (1926‚Äì1940), it gradually became a world-renowned secondary school with a boarding section (1934‚Äì2005). Examining the population censuses of the British Era (see Demography section), we observe a steady increase in the number of Armenians in Cyprus, ranging from 201 in 1881 to 4,549 in 1956. In their vast majority, they were Armenian Apostolic, but there was also a small number of Armenian Catholics and Armenian Protestants. In the 1960 population census, 3,628 Armenians were recorded ‚Äì in contrast to 4,549 in 1956 ‚Äì as about 900 Armenian-Cypriots had emigrated to Great Britain, Australia and elsewhere, not only because of the difficult economic conditions of the time, but mainly due to the emergency situation caused by the EOKA liberation struggle (1955‚Äì1959) and the uncertainty that some felt with the departure of the British, whom they viewed as their protectors. In fact, a large portion of British-Armenians hail from Cyprus. Independence era (1960‚Äìpresent) The end of the EOKA liberation struggle (1955‚Äì1959) found Armenian-Cypriots having forged strong bonds with the rest of the Cypriots. The 1960 Independence brought a new era for the Armenians of Cyprus, who ‚Äì together with the Maronites and the Latins ‚Äì were recognised as a ‚Äúreligious group‚Äù by the Constitution (Article 2 ¬ß 3) and were now represented by an elected Representative ‚Äì initially a member of the Greek Communal Chamber (Article 109) and, since 1965, a member of the House of Representatives (Law 12/1965). The size of the community, however, had been reduced because of the emigration of about 900 Armenian-Cypriots to the United Kingdom, due to the emergency situation caused by the EOKA liberation struggle (1955‚Äì1959) and the poor state of the local economy. A second factor that contributed to the reduction of the community's size was the emigration of about 600 Armenian-Cypriots to Soviet Armenia, as part of the Panarmenian movement for ‚Äúrepatriation‚Äù during the 1962‚Äì1964 period (nerkaght). During the 1963‚Äì1964 inter-communal troubles, the Armenian-Cypriot community suffered major losses, as the Armenian quarter of Nicosia was captured by Turkish Cypriots. Taken were the Prelature building, the mediaeval Virgin Mary church, the Melikian-Ouzounian school, the Genocide Monument, the club houses of the Armenian Club, AYMA and Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU), as well as the Armenian Evangelical church; also taken was the mediaeval Ganchvor church in Famagusta. In total, 231 Armenian-Cypriot families became victims to the Turks and/or lost their shops and enterprises. As a result, hundreds of Armenian-Cypriots left for Great Britain, Canada, Australia and the United States. After the 1974 Turkish invasion, the Armenian-Cypriot community suffered additional losses: 4‚Äì5 families living in Kyrenia, about 30 families in Nicosia and 40‚Äì45 families in Famagusta became refugees, while an Armenian-Cypriot lady (Rosa Bakalian) has been missing since then; the renowned Magaravank monastery in Pentadhaktylos was taken by the Turkish troops, the Melkonian boys' dormitory was bombed by the Turkish Air Force, while the Ayios Dhometios Armenian cemetery was hit by mortars and fell within the buffer zone. As a result, dozens of Armenian-Cypriots emigrated, mainly to Great Britain ‚Äì in total, about 1,300 Armenian-Cypriots left Cyprus in the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to those who emigrated to Soviet Armenia. The nerkaght [’∂’•÷Ä’£’°’≤’©=repatriation, also known as ’∞’°’µ÷Ä’•’∂’°’§’°÷Ä’±’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂ (hayrenatartsoutiun=home-coming)] movement was a Panarmenian migration movement of Diasporan Armenians to Soviet Armenia, within the framework of a co-ordinated attempt of the Armenian SSR and the Church of Armenia to strengthen their claims on historical Armenia's territory, appealing to the patriotic sentiments of Armenians in the Diaspora; especially after World War II, nerkaght was also a way to partially replace the large number of Armenians who perished during the War. Massive propaganda took place, in co-operation with the AGBU and the Ramgavar party, arousing a storm of enthusiasm in the Armenian communities of the Diaspora and creating high expectations for their settling in the ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù, which they perceived as their ultimate destination. In retrospect, nerkaght could also be considered as Soviet manoeuvre in the Cold War era. Nerkaghts waves took place between 1921‚Äì1925 (19,688 people), 1926‚Äì1929, 1932‚Äì1933, 1936 (22,598), 1946‚Äì1949 (the largest wave, with 89,780 repatriates) and 1962‚Äì1982 (31,920 people), when 163,986 Armenians in total migrated to Soviet Armenia from Iran, Greece, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, France, Bulgaria, Egypt, Turkey, Romania, Palestine, Jordan, Cyprus, the United States, Great Britain, Argentina, China, Israel and elsewhere. Between 1944‚Äì1948, there was the Friends of Armenia Association [’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂’´ ‘≤’°÷Ä’•’Ø’°’¥’°÷Å ’Ñ’´’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂ (Hayastani Paregamats Mioutiun)], which was established by AGBU and Ramgavar party supporters, with the purpose of promoting love for the Soviet ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù and the acquaintance with its culture. Other than the various other sports, cultural, social, charity and other events, there was massive propaganda in favour of the nerkaght movement, including articles in the Association's ‚ÄúNor Arax‚Äù newspaper, as well as in the Greek-Cypriot communist ‚ÄúDimokratis‚Äù newspaper, lectures and other events. Despite the opposition of the Dashnaktsoutiun party and the colonial government, about 2,000 Armenian-Cypriots had registered; in the end, however, Armenians from poorer countries of the Middle East and the Balkans were preferred. However, there were 4‚Äì5 individual Armenian-Cypriot families who emigrated to Soviet Armenia on their own in 1947. With the announcement of the new wave of nerkaght in 1961, the AGBU and the Ramgavar party started over an even more massive propaganda in favour of ‚Äúrepatriation‚Äù. Lectures, film screenings and radio broadcasts were organised, speakers from Soviet Armenia were hosted, which was visited by an Armenian-Cypriot delegation ‚Äì which later on presented its impressions both in speeches and in the ‚ÄúHenaran‚Äù newspaper. Propaganda in favour of nerkaght was also in the left-wing Greek-Cypriot ‚ÄúHaravgi‚Äù newspaper, as well at the Melkonian Educational Institute. On the other hand, there was strong opposition on the part of the Dashnaktsoutiun party, for both ideological and pragmatic reasons. As a result, 576 Armenian- Cypriots in total were repatriated to Soviet Armenia between 1962‚Äì1964 (amounting to about 15% of the community at the time). From Famagusta's harbour 20 left on 19 September 1962 (with the ‚ÄúFelix Dzerzhinsky‚Äù steamship), 373 on 3 October 1962 (with the ‚ÄúGruzia‚Äù steamship), 168 on 19 October 1963 (with the ‚ÄúLitva‚Äù steamship) and 15 on 4 September 1964 (with the ‚ÄúOdessa‚Äù steamship). Most of them settled in Girovagan (Vanatsor), with a smaller number settling in Leninagan (Guymri). Over the years, some of them managed to re-settle in Yerevan. Coupled with the exodus of about 900 Armenian-Cypriots to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the United States during the EOKA emergency (1955‚Äì1959), the further emigration of about 600 Armenian-Cypriots to Soviet Armenia brought about a significant reduction to the size of the community, by about a third. Families were divided (not simply ideologically ‚Äì but also physically), important members of the community were no longer part of it, while unrest was hovering over the future of the community ‚Äì especially after the 1963‚Äì1964 intercommunal violence and the ousting of Armenian- Cypriots from their ancient quarter in Nicosia. Additionally, as news of the emigrants' bad living and financial conditions finally arrived in Cyprus (through coded letters or photographs ‚Äì due to Soviet censorship -, as well as from visitors to/from Soviet Armenia), there was a sense of bitterness over the whole situation, as well as further rivalry between Dashnaktsoutiun (favouring a free and an independent Armenia) and anti-Dashnaktsoutiun organisations (supporting or, at least, settling with a Soviet Armenia). The latter also lost a number of supporters, as most of the emigrants were affiliated with AGBU and/or Ramgavar. Finally, Dashnaktsoutiun gained more sympathisers in some disillusioned AGBU and/or Ramgavar supporters. Disappointed by what they saw and lived through, almost all of the ones who went to Soviet Armenia wanted to return to Cyprus from the start, as they were not accustomed to that kind of life. Due to restrictions from the Soviet regime, in order to come back, a large number of them moved to Baku, Azerbaijan. The adventurous return started in 1967 and continued until 2005, although most of them came during the late 1980s (after the Spitak earthquake) and the early 1990s (after the dissolution of the Soviet Union). In fact, the first wave of Armenians from Armenia who came to Cyprus after 1991 were mostly Armenian-Cypriots who had migrated to Soviet Armenia in the 1960s and their spouses/descendants. Their lives have been indelibly marked, also creating a sort of ‚Äúidentity crisis‚Äù: in Cyprus they are considered ‚ÄúHayastantsi‚Äù (Armenians from Armenia), while in Armenia they were considered ‚ÄúGibratsi‚Äù (Cypriots) or ‚ÄúGibrahay‚Äù (Armenians from Cyprus). The Armenian compound in Strovolos, Nicosia With the unfailing support of the government, the small yet industrious Armenian community of Cyprus gradually managed to recover from its losses and continued to prosper in the remaining urban areas, contributing culturally and socioeconomically to the development of its homeland. On 24 April 1975, Cyprus became the first European country (and the second worldwide, after Uruguay) to recognise the Armenian Genocide with Resolution 36/1975; two more resolutions followed, Resolution 74/1982 and Resolution 103/1990, with the latter declaring 24 April as a National Remembrance Day of the Armenian Genocide in Cyprus. Over the past decades, the dynamics of the Armenian-Cypriot community have changed with the increased number of marriages with Greek-Cypriots and other non-Armenians, and the arrival over the last 30‚Äì35 years of thousands of Armenian political and economic immigrants because of the civil war in Lebanon (1975‚Äì1990), the insurgencies in Syria (1976‚Äì1982), the Islamic revolution in Iran and the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1978‚Äì1988), as well as after the Spitak earthquake (1988) and the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991); some of them have settled permanently in Cyprus. According to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of the Council of Europe, the Armenian language ‚Äì the mother tongue of the vast majority of Armenian-Cypriots ‚Äì was recognised as a minority language of Cyprus as of 1 December 2002.

Biography  Mlynek studied physics from 1970 to 1976 at the Technical University of Hannover and at the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris. In 1979, he obtained his doctor¬¥s degree and habilitated in 1984. Between 1976 and 1981, Mlynek was a scientific assistant in Hannover and in 1982 he worked for one year as a post-doctoral fellow with the IBM Research Laboratory in San Jose, California. After three years as academic assistant in Hannover he became a Heisenberg fellow of the German Research Foundation (DFG ‚Äì Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) in 1985 and served as assistant professor at the ETH Zurich from 1986 to 1990. In 1990, Mlynek became a full professor for experimental physics at the University of Konstanz. There he realized an atom inferometer for the first time and conducted groundbreaking experiments in the field of atom optics and quantum optics. Among them are his works on the Heisenberg microscope and the measurement of the Wigner function of the quantum state of matter and light. Since 2000 he has been professor for experimental physics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. From 1996 to 2001, he was vice president of the German Research Foundation (DFG) where he dedicated himself to encouraging young academics. Between 2000 and 2005, Mlynek was president of the Humboldt University. During his term of presidency, he had to implement a series of reforms due to drastic reductions in order to downsize structures and to promote excellence. Besides, the sciences moved from Berlin Mitte to Adlershof and it was decided to build the Grimm library in Berlin Mitte. In 2005, shortly after his reelection as president of the Humboldt University, Mlynek switched to the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres, Germany‚Äôs largest science organization, and became president. In June 2009, he was reelected for a second and last presidential term (2010-2015). During his presidency, program-oriented research was enhanced and the Helmholtz mission was strengthened in terms of strategic research for the national benefit. In addition, he developed new tools of strategic cooperation with universities like Helmholtz alliances and Helmholtz Institutes. In 2006, Mlynek was one of the co-founders of the foundation \\"Haus der kleinen Forscher\\" which was supported by the Helmholtz Association from the beginning. It has now become the most successful initiative on education for young children in the German speaking countries. Furthermore, he established the Helmholtz Management Academy for teaching management techniques in the domain of science. The academy is also open to partner organizations and universities. Since September 2015 he has resumed teaching as a professor in the physics department of the Humboldt University. Since the spring term in 2016, he has been officially released as a professor. Among his offices are Chairman of the Board of Trustees at the Falling Walls Foundation, Chairman of the Strategic Advisory Board of the European Quantum Technology Flagship Initiative, Chairman of the Foundation Board at the \\"Haus der kleinen Forscher\\", Chairman of the Board of Trustees at the Foundation Brandenburger Tor, board member of the Wilhelm und Else Heraeus Foundation, as well as member of various university and science committees. Furthermore, he is a board member of the Holtzbrinck publishing group, of the company Carl Zeiss and WISTA-Management GmbH. Mlynek worked in the field of experimental quantum optics, atomic physics and surface physics. He has published more than 200 papers (SCI:7875 / h-index:47). He is married since 1972 to teacher Dagmar Mlynek and has two sons. Honors and awards Mlynek is a member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, National Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech) and the Academia Europaea. * 1985 Heisenberg Fellow, German Research Foundation * 1987 Physik-Preis, German Physical Society * 1992 Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz Preis, German Research Foundation * 1996 Max-Born Preis, Institute of Physics and German Physical Society * 2003 Urania Medal Berlin * 2008 Order of Merit of Berlin * 2009 Lower Saxony Order of Merit * 2010 Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany * 2012 Honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Natural Sciences of the University of Ulm * 2014 Ring of Honor of Garbsen * 2019 Goldenes Ehrenzeichen f√ºr Verdienste um die Republik √ñsterreichs 2019, Pr√§sidentschaftskanzlei Alexander Van der Bellen  Selected publications       References 1951 births Living people German physicists Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Humboldt University of Berlin faculty Presidents of the Humboldt University of Berlin ETH Zurich faculty ","title":"J√ºrgen Mlynek"},{"id":"42895898","text":"Pedro E.

In November 1944 a group of French African soldiers who had been captured by the Germans were returned to Senegal and housed in a base at Thiaroye. When they failed to receive their promised pay in arrears, the soldiers refused an order to board lorries heading for Bamako. As a result, officers opened fire, killing 40 soldiers. What became known as the Thiaroye Massacre was perceived as French ingratitude, and the situation was further inflamed when some of the survivors were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a military tribunal the following year. Further resentment was caused by a French government decree of 19 February 1945 that extended voting rights in Senegal to European women but not African women, which should not have been possible under the laws passed by Blaise Diagne in 1915 and 1916, which forbade racial differentiation.Mortimer, pp60‚Äì61 Campaign Following the death of Ngalandou Diouf in 1941, Lamine Gu√®ye was the most experienced politician in France's African colonies. The leader of the Senegalese branch of the SFIO, he had represented the Thiaroye soldiers in court, and was elected mayor of Dakar in July 1945. He decided to forgo party politics during the election campaign, and formed a comit√© d'entente (committee of agreement) together with the Communists, Gaullists and other political organisations.Mortimer, p61 An agreement was reached to contest the elections as an African Bloc, although this was effectively the other parties lending their support to the SFIO candidates. L√©opold S√©dar Senghor was the SFIO's surprise choice for the second college seat. He had lived abroad for several years and only joined the party 16 hours before being chosen as its candidate, largely due to the influence of Lamine Gu√®ye.

A steam juicer (steam extractor) is a household kitchen utensil for separating juice from berries, fruits, and some types of vegetables in a process called steam juice extraction that is primarily used for preserving harvests faster than they can be consumed when fresh. Operation It makes use of steam to transfer gentle heat directly to the berries that are supported above a boiling water pot in a perforated basket. The juice is collected in the middle section and let out with a small hose while still hot and sterile directly into clean bottles for long term unrefrigerated storage. The quality of the juice is high with few solids due to the non-mechanical extraction process. The units are generally made in a three-tier configuration that somewhat resembles a huge double boiler. The bottom section is a simple pot placed on a kitchen hot plate or gas range to boil water to generate the steam for the process. The next section is the juice collection container with an opening in the middle to pass the steam through. It has a hose fitting that is used to drain it directly into storage bottles. The top section is a perforated basket (with a loose-fitting lid) to hold the berries while allowing the steam to reach the complete batch but holding the berries (pulp, skins and pips) out of the extracted juice. The process is convenient and as safe as any other stove-top cooking. The steam is not held under pressure and the juice is delivered with a rubber hose that requires minimal extra operations, occasionally a funnel with a strainer may be used to make the bottling more convenient. As usual one needs to be careful of scalding hot juice and the possibility of pulling over the tall juicer. When loading the charge of berries into the strainer section sugar may be added (in alternating layers) the amount depending on the projected use, sugar also acts as a preservative. Other additives may be pectin to prepare jellies, ascorbic acid to improve shelf life and other ingredients that will dissolve and mix with the juice as it is extracted. To get a consistent batch of juice the whole charge is allowed to extract and then bottled when complete; draining of the juice as it extracts will result in different compositions from start to end of the batch. Long dwell times in juicers made from aluminium when preparing acid juices is not recommended. Increasing the steam flow-rate may improve the juice extraction rate. History This was a popular type of harvest juicer as it prepared the juice for immediate bottling in good sized batches. There is generally no need to strain or boil the juice after mechanical juicing and it could be operated over a wood stove in the rural countryside. They are still popular in Finland and elsewhere and have been marketed under various names (Mehu Maija, MehuLiisa, MehuMatti, Krona) by various manufacturers (OY Alu AB, Hackmann, Opa, Victorio, Lehmann, Norpro) over the years. The same style of juicer has also been historically made in Germany and Portugal and now in China. Some of the modern units incorporate an electrical heating element in the steam generating pot that makes for very convenient operation away from the kitchen where small spills and hot stoves are not a problem. The first units were probably made from aluminum due to the ease of fabrication of the complex shapes by metal spinning. Some have been made from enamelled steel (a German trend) and the modern bare metal units have moved to stainless steel alloys to prevent aluminium from leaching into the juice at the time of preparation. Uses The steam juicer is eminently well suited to preparing berry juices at the time of harvest for long term preservation due to the pasteurization that results from the extraction process. They are also used to make jellies and cook vegetables in the tradition of a normal steamer or blanching for freezer storage. They have been used as emergency distillation units for preparing clean water and medicinal alcohol.

It is the oldest Shakespeare society in the world, having been in existence since 1824. It now meets monthly between October and May at the Shakespeare Institute, for a series of lectures on a wide range of Shakespeare-related subjects.  History  On 23 April 1824, Mr Thomas Hyde held a dinner at the Falcon Inn to commemorate Shakespeare's Birthday. This event, attended by a dozen or so local gentlemen, is usually taken to mark the foundation of the Shakespeare Club. \\"The first object of the Club was the annual celebration of the poet's birthday as well as the carrying out of a triennial commemoration on a larger scale\\"Brown, Ivor & Fearon, George. Amazing monument. A short history of the Shakespeare Industry. London & Toronto: Heinemann, 1939, p. 104 This was not however the first occasion on which Stratfordians had independently come together to honour the memory of Shakespeare. 1816 had marked the bicentenary of his death and \\"was commemorated by public banquets, a ball and firework display\\", and other celebrations were held between 1816 and 1823.Fox, Levi. The Borough Town of Stratford-upon-Avon. Stratford-upon-Avon: Corporation of Stratford-upon-Avon, 1953 p. 151. The 1824 Club though proved so successful that by 1826 the annual dinner had to be held in the Town Hall rather than the Falcon Inn. By 1827, when the first triennial commemoration was held the club's membership numbered 400, a procession of Shakespeare's characters walked around the town before proceeding to New Place to lay the foundation stone of the town's first permanent theatre.Halliday, Frank Ernest. The cult of Shakespeare. London: Gerald Duckworth, 1957, p. 135 In the same year a rival Shakespeare Club, the True Blue Club, was also founded, and for several years the two were in direct competition.Brown, Ivor & Fearon, George. Amazing monument. A short history of the Shakespeare Industry. London & Toronto: Heinemann, 1939, p. 106 In 1830 the original club was honoured as \\"King George IV...became the patron of the Club. ..henceforward ... to be known as the Royal Shakespearean Club\\".Brown, Ivor & Fearon, George. Amazing monument. A short history of the Shakespeare Industry. London & Toronto: Heinemann, 1939, p. 109 The Club continued under royal patronage until its refounding in 1874. In 1835 the Club set up the Shakespearean Monumental Committee to raise money to restore Shakespeare's monument and the graves of his family in Holy Trinity Church. Then in 1837 it was announced that \\"The object of the members of the Royal Shakespearean Club is not to convene an assembly...merely to enjoy the festive board. They desire to add, if possible, honour to the memory ... to preserve every relic... to render his works more universally read... and to hand down his writings to posterity\\".Warwickshire Advertiser 29 April 1837 The Club extended the range of its involvement \\"to the preservation of the house in which Shakespeare's father resided, in Henley Street, the presumed Birthplace of Shakespeare; and to Anne Hathaway's Cottage, and even to the purchase of the site of New Place\\". It was a committee formed by the Shakespeare Club that took on the responsibility of organising the purchase of the Birthplace which eventually led to the creation of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. In the second half of the nineteenth century the Club that had once initiated all Shakespeare- related activity in the town found itself without an over-riding purpose as first the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, then the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, were founded in order to preserve the memory of Shakespeare, the buildings associated with him, and the promotion of his works. These organisations also took on the responsibility of organising annual festivities. The Club reinvented itself in the 1870s, and was formally refounded in 1874, becoming largely a social club offering lectures during the year. Now its main role is as a meeting-place for Shakespeare-lovers in the town at its meetings and at the Shakespeare Birthday Celebrations. Social events are occasionally held and the Club takes part in the Shakespeare Birthday Celebrations, when a laurel wreath is carried to the church to be hung directly below Shakespeare's Monument in recognition of the Club's historic importance. (The wreath-laying tradition was first instituted in 1895.) The Club's president changes annually and each year one meeting is the presidential evening. Presidents are usually academics or theatre professionals: in recent years presidents have included Professor Stanley Wells, Michael Attenborough and Professor Michael Dobson. Distinguished past presidents have included John Gielgud, Peggy Ashcroft and Professor Kenneth Muir. In November 2016 a full history of the Club was published, written by two long-serving members of the committee, Susan Brock and Sylvia Morris.Brock, Susan & Morris, Sylvia.

An \\"appropriate\\" procedure is one for which the expected health benefits exceed the expected health risks by a wide margin. Ideally, AUC are evidence-based, but in the absence of sufficient evidence, may be derived from a consensus of expert opinion. AUC are typically classified in terms of the quality of the evidence on which they are based. In general, AUC are promulgated by medical specialty organizations (professional societies). The definition of \\"appropriate\\" is subject to interpretation. For example, a key issue is whether or not a procedure or investigation can be deemed appropriate if it does not result in a change in management. Relative costs of alternative appropriate procedures may or may not be considered in selecting a procedure for an individual patient, but in there is evidence that performing only appropriate procedures reduces volume and cost. To reduce the cost of (advanced) diagnostic imaging tests, a requirement for the use of clinical decision support for was included in the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, though it does not apply to emergency or inpatient services. AUC are not always consistent between sources, or with other guidelines, or with reimbursement decisions. Additionally, AUC have not shown an impact in physician's behaviour. AUC may be promulgated in human-readable form, or converted into an electronic structured form for use in a clinical decision support system, such as a computerized physician order entry system.

It is usually reserved for younger patients who are generally more active. Angular deformities were first described by Mikulicz-Radecki in 1880. He observed that the axis of the lower extremity passes through the three joints of the hip, knee and ankle in normal individuals and the knee center deviates from this line in angular deformities of the knee. In this case, the medial compartment will bear the weight in genu varum and the lateral compartment will bear weight in genu valgum, and osteoarthritis will develop in the mentioned compartment. High tibial osteotomy was first described by Jackson in 1958 and has nowadays become a well-established surgery. Coventry, who was a pioneer in this field, has published many reports on the results of closed wedge HTO. Orthopedic dual sliding compression plate (ODSCP) was designed and introduced for open wedge high tibial osteotomies. The advantages over the conventional techniques are reducing the chance of accidental intra-articular extension of the osteotomy, eliminating the potential risk of unwanted translation or rotation of the bone, ability to readjust the alignment after surgery without the need to remove the bone screws. Since the population in most countries is becoming aged, genu varum and consequently the resulting osteoarthritis will increase, and if the patient fulfills the criteria, high tibial osteotomy is advisable.

It was founded by the archaeologist James Burgess to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India and was notable for the high quality of its epigraphic illustrations which enabled scholars to make accurate translations of texts that in many cases remain the definitive versions to this day. It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian folklore. It was succeeded by The New Indian Antiquary (1938-47) and the Indian Antiquary (1964-71). History The Indian Antiquary was founded in 1872 by the archaeologist James Burgess CIE as a journal of original research relating to India.

Miller, British India Press, pp. 3-4. although no contributor or editor was ever paid for their work and the editors often had to support the publication out of their own pockets. Burgess was the first editor and he continued in that role until the end of 1884 when failing eyesight forced him to hand over to John Faithfull Fleet and Richard Carnac Temple. The late nineteenth century was marked by a great increase in the number of local historical societies in India and a similar increase in the number of Indians who could speak and write English, to the extent that by the 1920s the entire journal could have been filled with work by Indian contributors. Volumes for 1925 to 1932 were published under the authority of the Council of the Royal Anthropological Institute (1933, not).

Content The journal had an archaeological and historical focus, and in the late nineteenth century that naturally meant that epigraphy (the study of inscriptions as writing rather than as literature) would be one of the principal subjects covered in its pages. Indeed, the Antiquary was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian epigraphy until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of epigraphy, the Epigraphia Indica, was published as a quarterly supplement to the Antiquary between 1892 and 1920. The Antiquary was printed at Mazgaon, Bombay, by the Bombay Education Society and later the British India Press, but illustrations were produced in London by the firm of Griggs who were known for the accuracy of their work. A high standard of reproduction was essential so that scholars could work on the epigraphic material without needing to see the originals.Temple, p. 6. Illustrations in the Antiquary were used by scholars such as Bhandarkar, Bhagvanlal Indraji, Georg B√ºhler, John Faithfull Fleet, Eggeling and B. Lewis Rice to decipher important inscriptions,History, Archaeological Survey of India, 2011. Retrieved 30 May 2014. and in many cases their translations remain the definitive versions to this day. Over one thousand plates were included in The Indian Antiquary and the Epigraphia Indica over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times before they reached Bombay safely. Another area where the Antiquary led was in recording folklore and folktales. Its publication of Punjab folktales was the first attempt to classify the events on which folk tales were basedTemple, p. 7. and the pioneering work on north Indian folklore of William Crooke and Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube was printed in its pages.\\"Introduction\\" by Sadhana Naithani in References External links The Indian Antiquary at archive.org Publications established in 1872 Publications disestablished in 1971 Numismatics journals Archaeology journals History of India Archaeology of India Epigraphy Asian history journals Folklore journals Ethnology Languages of India Philology journals Anthropology journals English-language journals Indology journals ","title":"The Indian Antiquary"},{"id":"42896736","text":"William Joseph Murnane (March 22, 1945 ‚Äì November 17, 2000) was an American Egyptologist and author of a number of books and monographs on Ancient Egypt.

Life  The Tagaris family is first attested in the early years of the 14th century. George's father Manuel Tagaris was the first of the family to rise to prominence: despite his family's low social status, his valour and ability as a general were recognized by Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos, who promoted him to the rank of megas stratopedarches and gave him his niece, Theodora Palaiologina Asanina, a daughter of Tsar Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria, as his second wife. It is unclear if Theodora or Manuel's first wife, a Monomachina Doukaina, was George's mother. George may in turn have been a brother or father‚Äîor somehow otherwise related‚Äîto the future Latin Patriarch of Constantinople Paul Palaiologos Tagaris. George Tagaris first appears in 1346, during the Byzantine civil war of 1341‚Äì47. At the time he already held the rank of megas stratopedarches, like his father before him, and was entrusted by Empress- regent Anna of Savoy with a mission to the Turkish ruler Saruhan Bey, to enlist his support in the war, especially after the Empress' opponent, John Kantakouzenos, had successfully concluded an alliance with Orhan, ruler of the rising Ottoman beylik. Saruhan, who had known George's father from the latter's tenure as governor of Philadelphia, gladly complied with the request. George is next mentioned in 1356, when he was among the recipients of letters from Pope Innocent VI, who praised him for his support of a union between the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches.

Plot Andr√© Ferren learns from his girlfriend and co-worker Susan Winters that the biggest client of his brokerage firm, Hermann Rolf, not only wants to replace Andr√© with Susan, but asked Susan on a date. Andr√© orders Susan to go on the date and Rolf asks Susan to marry him. Susan agrees on the condition that Rolf entrust his fortune to Andr√© as a gift. Weeks later, Rolf and Susan are married at Rolf's castle in the Swiss Alps. Andr√© assures Susan that he will create a financial scandal that will ruin Rolf and she can divorce him. Andr√© is then accused by the top executives at the brokerage firm of stealing $2.5 million from Rolf's account. He is given ten days to return the money or go to prison. Andr√© drives to a ski resort where Susan is having an affair with Larry, a ski instructor. Andr√© explains to Susan that he is being framed. A skier attempts to murder Andr√© with a ski pole, but Andr√© falls and the other skier dies instead. That night, Susan informs Andr√© that they cannot be seen together or Rolf will divorce her, and explains that Rolf murdered all his ex- wives. Andr√© survives several more attempts on his life as he follows Susan and Larry to Rolf's castle, including an episode at a village inn where a woman attempts to strangle him. Eventually Andr√© sneaks into the castle, where he is imprisoned by a sword-wielding Larry. Susan asks Larry to drive her Maserati Indy to Switzerland and deliver a letter to a banker. In the process of doing so, he passes Rolf's Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud, and Rolf's manservant Henkel shoots, causing the Maserati to explode. Susan shoots a man in a suit of armor attempting to stab Andr√© through the cell bars; lifting the visor reveals the face of the innkeeper. Susan then begins noticing hidden surveillance cameras throughout the castle as Rolf sends Henkel on foot to kill Andr√©. Susan tells Rolf through one of the cameras that her feelings have changed. She then tells Andr√© to make love to her and smashes the camera, bringing a tear to Rolf's eye as he watches surveillance footage from inside the Rolls-Royce. Henkel locks the castle gates and hides in a mortar, but is shot out of it when Susan pulls the lanyard. Rolf gets drunk, falls down a ravine and walks through the snow. The next morning, Susan and Andr√© lie in bed and realize that Rolf had set them both up in a scheme to murder them. Meanwhile, Rolf has frozen to death standing up.

History Brighton is on the Toronto-Montr√©al mainlines of both the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railway, which run side-by-side through the village. It once had a third railway, the Canadian Northern Railway, whose tracks occupied the Prince Edward County Railway right of way into Trenton, Ontario. At its peak, ten trains daily stopped at one or another of the three local passenger rail stations, all within a few blocks of one another. Brighton's rail history dates to the October 27, 1856 opening of the Grand Trunk line from Montr√©al to Toronto. The current-day Maplewood Street was Railroad Street, agriculture was slowly displacing forestry as the primary local industry and communities long reliant on water transport were eagerly awaiting the rails as a means of access to larger markets. In its heyday, the Brighton GTR station was a group of seven buildings and a stock yard; there was a freight shed, two private coal sheds, a wooden water tank and large piles of lumber (GTR's steam trains originally burned wood). The station itself is a \\"Type C\\" second-class wayside station, much like those still in rail service in Napanee and Port Hope; a single-story building with five door or window arches on the sides and two arches on each end. Most of these were built from limestone to a standard GTR design with a stone chimney on each of four corners; the Brighton station differs from the others in its use of brick. The original chimneys are now gone. The railway allowed fruit to be canned in Brighton and transported to ocean ports for shipment overseas; it transported Brighton dairy products to market in Toronto and, in summer, brought thousands of passengers to Presqu'ile Provincial Park, which became an Ontario provincial park in 1922. At the time of the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, an era when there were only fifty motorcars in the village, a second railway came to town: the Canadian Pacific Railway. A fledgling third national railway, the Canadian Northern (CNoR), completed a line from Quebec to British Columbia in 1915. CNoR was bankrupt by the end of the war, a third carrier in a saturated market, and was merged by the federal government into what is now Canadian National. CN built a short-lived CNoR Brighton station in 1920, only to abandon it after Grand Trunk's ill-fated attempt to expand westward left it bankrupt in 1922 and part of CNR by 1923. Much of the CNoR infrastructure was duplicative of CN's Grand Trunk line and was abandoned; passenger service moved to the original 1857 Brighton station and the 1920 CNoR station was eventually demolished. The first efforts to pave the 1817-era stagecoach York Road as a Provincial Highway came near the end of the Great War; by 1964, most of that road, the main street of southeastern Ontario, had been bypassed by construction of a four-lane freeway, Ontario Highway 401. Rail passenger numbers had peaked near the time of World War II and were soon in freefall. Brighton's tiny 1857 passenger rail station was abandoned and boarded up a few years after the freeway came to town, sitting vacant through the 1970s and 1980s. While much infrastructure had been removed, the original Brighton station building now survives as a museum and was provincially designated on August 16, 2000 under Part 4 of the Ontario Heritage Act. Museum In 1995, Ralph and Eugenia Bangay purchased the long-abandoned Brighton Station from CN for $400 as a place to store a growing collection of Brighton rail memorabilia. They restored the gentlemen's waiting room, express office and agent's room in the old brick station to house hundreds of artefacts, using the ladies' passenger waiting room as a souvenir shop. A 1906 Grand Trunk 2-8-0 steam locomotive (#2534), relocated from Zwick's Park in nearby Belleville, occupies pride of place alongside two box cars (one from 1913), a flat car, three cabooses (including one from 1929) and an 1898 velocipede (a handcar used by repair workers to travel along the tracks). The Murrow Building, which served before 1920 as a distribution point for Ford motorcars destined for dealers from Bowmanville to Gananoque, houses additional memorabilia. The site also includes an 1880s Hops Barn and artefacts ranging from Coca-Cola once bottled in Brighton to Morse code equipment. The busy CN and CP mainlines still run side-by-side beside the museum, but the countless Via Rail trains carrying passengers from Montreal and Ottawa to Toronto do not stop. See also =Stations= Of an estimated 32-34 Grand Trunk wayside stations built when the line opened, a half-dozen originals remain on the Montr√©al-Toronto 1856 Grand Trunk mainline: * Napanee railway station and Port Hope railway station are restored and remain in passenger service. * Belleville, Ontario railway station served until 2012 (when a new station was built adjacent) and now houses offices. * Prescott, Ontario's station now houses the local historical society office; the train does not stop. * Ernestown, Ontario's station is boarded up and abandoned. * Brighton's station is Memory Junction. Little remains of the Kingston, Ontario outer station ruins but the exterior limestone shell. Two original stations on the Toronto- Sarnia line still stand, of which one (the Georgetown GO station) remains in passenger use. =Museums= One museum remains on the former CNoR line from Toronto-Brighton-Napanee-Smiths Falls; the abandoned Smiths Falls station is now the Railway Museum of Eastern Ontario.

Director Alberto de Martino stated that Stuart Whitman agreed to do the film to have work outside of Hollywood. For the car chase in the film, de Martino did not use storyboards, stating he can't draw and was more influenced by his love of jazz music, starting in the background and improvising as he went along. Style Roberto Curti describes the film as \\"essentially a whodunnit of sorts, with the inclusion of the odd [Dario] Argento-like detail\\". He also notes that film has \\"very little to do with Italian poliziotteschi of the period\\". Release Strange Shadows in an Empty Room was released in Italy on March 9, 1976 where it was distributed by Fida. The film has been released with different titles in other English-speaking countries such as Blazing Magnum in the United Kingdom. Director De Martino stated that the film was based on an old story he had, titled D come Delitto (M for Murder) which he re-arranged slightly. After finishing it, a producer for the film sent a telegram to De Martino, which he claims it stated that \\"It's got nothing to envy in any American film.\\" Reception In a retrospective review, AllMovie stated that the film has \\"plenty of slick visuals and action but makes little sense: The script is a chaotic jumble of half-baked mystery\\" and that it is \\"never convincing or believable for a second and is further hurt by a lack of sympathetic characters\\".

Early life Ashby was born in Adelaide, South Australia as a youngest daughter of four children, of a property developer and naturalist Edwin Ashby and his South Australian-born wife Esther Maria, n√©e Coleman. In 1902, the family moved to a Blackwood farming property called Wittunga situated at the foot of the Adelaide Hills, which later became the Wittunga Botanic Garden. Ashby was mainly educated at home since she was handicapped by shyness, bad stutter and hypothyroidism. Encouraged by her father, she took an interest in native plants and began painting wildflowers. Career From 1944, after both her parents had died, Ashby began to make longer trips to collect plants as specimens for various herbaria and also to propagate from seeds and cuttings. She was an active member of the South Australian branch of the Society for Growing Australian Plants. From 1963 to 1977, she made regular car journeys each year to collect and illustrate plants, driving to Southwest Australia in the winter and to the Australian Alps in the summer. In 1972, she moved to Victor Harbor and died in 1987. Ashby's inherited section of her family's Wittunga property was donated to the National Trust of South Australia in 1957 and became the 32 ha Watiparinga Reserve.

Biography  Her father was Henry Anne de Fuligny- Damas (1669-1745), Comte de Rochechouart, Baron de Couches, Marigny-sur-Ouche, Aubigny, Agey and Saint-P√©reuse. She lost him at age three. When she turned seven, she was given into the care of the canonesses at Remiremont Abbey, where she received a classical education.Fran√ßois-Alexandre de La Chenaye- Aubert, Dictionnaire de la Noblesse, chez la Veuve Duchesne, 1776. After displaying a talent for drawing, she received lessons in Paris from Jean- Baptiste Greuze and G√©rard van Spaendonck. In 1760, she married Pierre Louis de Grollier, Marquis de Grollier and Treffort (1730-1793), the Governor of Pont-d'Ain and Deputy of the Nobility. While living at his castle, she became popular with the poor inhabitants of the nearby village. Later, they lived at the court in Versailles, in the apartments of Marie-Antoinette. She was attracted to the gardens there and later created one of her own in Lainville- en-Vexin. In 1793, she lost her husband to the guillotine and was forced to leave France. She went to Switzerland, then Germany and, finally, Italy. In Florence, her talent was soon recognized. The sculptor, Antonio Canova, once referred to her as the \\"Raphael of flowers\\". At this time, she also created some mosaics. Joseph-Marie Vien, Director of the French Academy in Rome, arranged for her return to France. She settled in with her nephew, , at his ch√¢teau in √âpinay-sur-Seine, where she practiced horticulture as well as painting. After his death, she began to give large sums to charity in his name. In 1823, she prevailed upon the engineer, Louis-Georges Mulot, to create an artesian aquifer in the ch√¢teau's park to provide clean drinking water for the local villagers. The work lasted for three years. In recognition for her efforts, she was named one of the founding members of the \\"Soci√©t√© d'Horticulture\\". She died shortly after, aged 86.

It is one of the oldest streets in modern Yerevan. The street runs from the Khanjyan street at the southeast, to Mashtots Avenue at the northwest, along the Yerevan Vernissage market, the National Gallery of Armenia and Missak Manouchian park. History View from the street The street was opened in 1837 and named Tsarskaya Street in the honour of Tsar Nicholas I who visited the city during that period. In 1919, after the death of the first interior minister of the First Republic of Armenia Aram Manukian, the street was officially renamed after him. After the sovietization of Armenia, the communists renamed the street after the bolshevik activist Suren Spandaryan in 1921. With the independence of Armenia in 1991, the name of Aram Manukian was restored and the street was officially renamed as Aram Street (in Armenian: Arami Poghots). Between 1917 and 1919, Aram Manukian lived in the building located at Aram Street 9. The building which belonged to Fadey Kalantaryan, dates back to 1910 and designed by architect Boris Mehrabyan.Aram ManukianOld Yerevan Aram Street in 2014 Aram Street was home to many old and traditional buildings of Yerevan. However, after the independence of Armenia, the majority of the historic buildings on the street were either entirely destroyed or transformed into modern residential buildings through the construction of additional floors. Only few structures were preserved, mainly in the portion that extends from the Abovyan Street to the Mashtots Avenue. \\"Old Yerevan\\" project In 2005, the Yerevan City Council proposed a plan to restore the old buildings on Aram Street, within the frames of \\"Old Yerevan\\" project. The initial plan had suggested to rebuild the historic buildings on the section located between the Abovyan Street and Mashtots park, at a length of 320 meters. However, the proposed plan was postponed for several years due to lack of financial resources. The budgeted amount for the investment on this project is around US$ 150 million, with a duration of between 3 and 5 years. In April 2013, the project was revived as the reconstruction process of some old buildings was launched. Based on the revised plan, \\"Old Yerevan\\" will be implemented in accordance with the master plan of Yerevan. Thus, the rehabilitated territory will recreate an urban environment that features the historical scene of Yerevan, commercially and culturally integrated into the modern life of the city.The President conducted a tour of the capital and familiarized with the process of implementation of the major investment programs References External linksOld images of Aram street Transport in Yerevan Roads in Armenia Streets in Yerevan ","title":"Aram Street"},{"id":"42897177","title":"1952 Mauritanian Territorial Assembly election"},{"id":"42897186","text":"Pacific Vibrations is a 1970 surfing documentary.Pacific Vibrations at New York Times\\"CLASSIC SURF FILM ‚ÄúPACIFIC VIBRATIONS‚Äù TO MAKE WORLD HD PREMIERE AT U.S. OPEN OF SURFING AUGUST 1 By SURFER\\" Surfermag posted on July 29, 2010 accessed 29 May 2014John Severson biography at Surfline See also List of American films of 1970 References External links 1970 films 1970 documentary films American documentary films American films Documentary films about surfing ","title":"Pacific Vibrations"},{"id":"42897188","text":"Territorial Assembly elections were held in Mauritania on 31 March 1957.

Function  microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20‚Äì24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop.

While she enjoys her promiscuity and carefree, urban single lifestyle, Christa seeks marriage with a man who will accept both her and her son Rolf, who lives with her parents. As Christa forms temporary relationships with an Italian businessman (who does not want to be a stepfather), an American artist (who wants an open marriage), and a French conductor (who tells her that he is too dedicated to music to give her what she wants), a private detective follows her. Torben, wealthy and reckless heir to a family fortune and Rolf's father, tried to force Christa to abort their son. He insists to her that she will return to him and secretly builds a library of dossiers on her lovers, while his business empire collapses from overaggressive expansion. London lawyer Derek is Christa's most serious relationship; she accepts his proposal, and plans to move to Australia with him. Torben threatens to use the dossiers and his greater financial resources to gain custody of Rolf, forcing her to end the engagement. After his last hope for saving his company fails, however, Torben commits suicide in front of Christa. The film ends with Derek, Christa, and Rolf reuniting at the nude beach.

Inception of the service As the need of a fast, air conditioned train to Haldwani, Lalkuan and Kathgodam was raised by several political leaders and citizens, Northern Railways decided to run an \\"AC Superfast\\" special service on temporary basis in late 2011. The train used to run on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays from both ends and on a time-table similar to today's Shatabdi Express. On receiving a satisfactory response, the 12039/40 Shatabdi Express was introduced on the same slot on other four days. The first run was made on 17 March 2012. Later by May 2012, the frequency of the Shatabdi Express was increased to six days a week and the AC Special was done away with. Coaches The train presently has one Executive Chair, ten AC Chair Cars & two End on Generator coaches. It does not carry a Pantry car coach but being a Shatabdi category train, catering is arranged on board the train cost of which is included in the ticket fare. The train started off with eight AC chair car coaches, but owing to the demand, the composition was amended in July 2015. The coach composition is as follows: 12039: LOCO- 12040: LOCO- Here 'LOCO' denotes the direction of the locomotive. stands for End-On-Generator Van, through are AC Chair Car Coaches and is the Executive Chair Car coach. The rake was non-self-generating ICF type and the maximum permissible speed of the rolling stock is 130 kmph though due to sectional speed restrictions, the train only touches a speed of 110 kmph at max. Later on 28 August 2015 this train was upgrade from ICF to LHB rake. Service The Kathgodam bound train covers the distance of 282 kilometres in 05 hours 30 mins (49 km/hr) while in the return direction it takes in 05 hours 15 mins (51 km/hr). The service was initially slower but speeded up by 5 minutes and 20 minutes respectively in the time-table revision of 2014. The train is the slowest member of the Shatabdi category of trains owing to the steep gradients in the Lalkuan-Kathgodam section, and single line operation post Rampur Junction. Journey The train starts from New Delhi at 06:20 hrs and reaches Kathgodam of at 11:40 hrs, the same day. In return the train starts back at 15:35 from Kathgodam to reach back New Delhi at 20:50 the same day.

Karen Brahe (born 1 December 1657 at N√¶sbyholm, died 27 September 1736 at √òstrupg√•rd, Haastrup parish), was a Danish aristocrat and book collector. Biography The third child of six born to Preben Brahe of Hvedholm, Engelsholm og √òstrupg√•rd (1627‚Äì1708) and Susanne G√∏ye (1634‚Äì83) and a relative of Jens Bille, Karen Brahe grew up reading, being taught by, amongst others, her mother and grandmother Karen Bille. She became an able administrator of her father's estate, which she ran from her mother's death until her father himself died. After her father's death, she moved to √òstrupg√•rd and became the estate owner there until her death. She was a diligent scholar. Karen Brahe was an avid letter writer. Her surviving letters cover a wide range of topics, from administration to literature to gossip. She never married. Karen Brahe's library In 1681, she inherited the library of her maternal grandfather's sister, Anne G√∏ye (1609‚Äì81), daughter of Henrik Gi√∏e of Sk√∏rringe and Turebyg√•rd. The library contained around 1000 printed books and 100 manuscripts, and Brahe went on to increase it.Anne Riising, Katalog over Karen Brahes Bibliothek i Landsarkivet for Fyn: H√•ndskriftsamlingen (Copenhagen: Munksgaard, 1956), p. 7. On 8 November 1716, she founded the Odense adelige jomfrukloster, a Lutheran collegiate foundation for unmarried noblewomen (now part of St. Catherine's Priory, Roskilde), which received royal confirmation on March 15, 1717. She bequeathed to it her library, now known as Karen Brahe's Library. The books were to belong to the monastery in perpetuity for the use of the young ladies there, but she also opened access to learning for other women.Anne Riising, Katalog over Karen Brahes Bibliothek i Landsarkivet for Fyn: H√•ndskriftsamlingen (Copenhagen: Munksgaard, 1956), pp. 7-8. Her main scholarly interest was theology, which accounts for more than half of her books. Another interest was history, primarily Denmark's, and this is the subject of about a quarter of the books. The last quarter contains more practical books such as legal collections, medical books, anatomical works, grease-stained cookbooks, and textbooks. There were also literary texts, which Anne G√∏ye's sister Anne Birgitte had collected. Among the famous books held by the library are the ballad collections Karen Brahes Folio (shelfmark E I,1) and Jens Billes visebog (E I,2); the only manuscript of Leonora Christina Ulfeldt's Heltinders Pryd (C V,1); and a rare first edition of Margrethe Lasson's Den bekl√¶dte sandhed. The library is the only private Danish library from the seventeenth century which survived fairly intact. Today it contains around 3,400 printed books, about 400 bound manuscripts, and another 600 or so unbound handwritten documents. Legacy The monastery's last residents moved out in 1970. In 1987, the Karen Brahe Society was founded with the aim of establishing a women's cultural center in the monastery buildings, now owned by Odense Municipality.

The bill was passed during the 113th United States Congress and signed into law on December 18, 2014. Background The bill was written in response to some claims by Federal reserve Board lawyers that the way the law is current written, they are required to apply rules about bank capital standards to insurance companies. A companion measure was introduced in the United States House of Representatives. Provisions of the bill The bill would give states more control over the \\"business insurance of foreign companies doing business within the United States.\\" The bill would revise section 171 of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a section which is sometimes called the \\"Collins Amendment\\". The bill would \\"clarify that the Federal Reserve Board can apply insurance-based capital standards to the insurance portion of any insurance holding company it oversees.\\" The change would mean that bank capital rules would be applied only to the banking portions of a business, with separate insurance capital rules being applied to insurance-related portions. Procedural history The Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States Senate on April 29, 2014 by Sen. Tom Coburn (R, OK). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. On June 3, 2014, the Senate voted with unanimous consent to pass the bill. The House passed the bill also by unanimous consent on December 10, 2014. It was signed by the President and became Public Law No: 113-279 on December 18, 2014. Debate and discussion The Hill called the bill \\"bipartisan\\". Organizations that could be affected by this change include the American International Group, Prudential Financial, MetLife, State Farm, and USAA. The American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) strongly supported the bill, purchasing advertisements in Roll Call and Politico to announce their support. The organization stated that \\"there is broad agreement on this position... The Obama administration, Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate, state and federal regulators and private industry all agree that life insurers should not be subject to capital standards more suited for the business of banking.\\" According to Mark A. Hofmann, the bill was an example of \\"common sense\\" because \\"no one, including Fed officials, has taken to the streets demanding that the Fed take over insurance regulation.\\" See alsoList of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External linksLibrary of Congress - Thomas S. 2270 *beta.congress.gov S. 2270 *GovTrack.us S. 2270 *OpenCongress.org S. 2270 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 2270 Acts of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014"},{"id":"42897587","title":"Kaali Venkat"},{"id":"42897590","text":"Savannah Airstrip (also known as Kihihi Airstrip) is an airport serving Savannah Resort and the town of Kihihi, Uganda.

After the 2019 European Parliament election Reda was succeeded by Dr. Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party Germany), Marcel Kolaja, Mark√©ta Gregorov√°, and Mikul√°≈° Peksa (Czech Pirate Party). In 2019 Reda became a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard.  Political career  Reda became a member of the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany when she was 16 years old. She studied politics and publicity sciences at the University of Mainz. In 2009, Reda started to become active for the national Pirate Party and from 2010 to 2012 she was chairperson of the Young Pirates ('). In 2013, she was one of the co-founders of the Young Pirates of Europe. In January 2014, she was chosen to top the list of the candidates for the European Elections for the Pirate Party Germany, who subsequently won one seat. In the European Parliament, Reda joined the Greens/EFA group. She is a member of the Legal Affairs committee as well as a substitute member of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and Petitions committees. She is on the Steering Committee of the Digital Agenda intergroup, a forum of MEPs interested in digital issues.

Copyright reform  MEP Reda at informal meeting in Washington, DC, concerning copyright issues in the United States. She has declared that copyright reform will be her focus for the legislative term. In November 2014, Reda was named rapporteur of the Parliament's review of 2001's Copyright Directive. Her draft report recommended the EU-wide harmonisation of copyright exceptions, a reduction in term length, broad exceptions for educational purposes and a strengthening of authors' negotiating position in relation to publishers, among other measures. Stakeholder reaction varied as the German artist coalition generally welcomed the draft while the French collecting society said it was \\"unacceptable\\"; author and copyright activist Cory Doctorow called the proposals \\"amazingly sensible\\", while former Swedish Pirate MEP Amelia Andersdotter criticised them as too conservative.

Designed by Val Page, the 6/1 was the first Triumph motorcycle to use a parallel-twin engine. A sidecar-equipped 6/1 won a silver medal in the 1933 International Six Days Trial and went on to win the Maudes Trophy for 1933. The 6/1 was a commercial failure, selling fewer than 600 in two years on the market. Background In conducting experiments with a single bank of Edward Turner's square four engine design, Turner and his supervisor, Ariel chief engineer Val Page both saw potential in the straight- twin as a motorcycle engine. From the experiments, it was shown that a 360¬∞ crank angle was better suited to the use of a single carburettor than a 180¬∞ crank angle. Page left Ariel in 1932 to become the chief motorcycle engineer at the Triumph Motor Company. Page replaced all but one of Triumph's existing line of single-cylinder motorcycles with his designs. Design and specifications In addition to redesigning Triumph's line of single-cylinder motorcycles, Page also designed a new twin-cylinder motorcycle. The 6/1 was the first Triumph motorcycle with a parallel-twin engine to enter production. Closeup of tank, handlebars and front suspension The 6/1 was designed primarily for use as a sidecar hauler, mainly as a smaller, more economical alternative to the one litre V-Twins and fours usually used to pull sidecars at the time. As such, strength and durability were given priority, resulting in a large motorcycle weighing . The engine was a 649 cc 360¬∞ parallel-twin with a 74 mm bore and an 80 mm stroke.A two-cylinder engine with a 74 mm bore and an 80 mm stroke should displace 688 cc The cylinder barrels and individual heads for each cylinder were made from cast iron. The crankcase was split vertically and held an oil tank with a capacity of . Unlike Page's single cylinder designs for Triumph, which had double-plunger oil pumps and were the first Triumph motorcycles with enclosed valve gear, the 6/1 had a single- plunger oil pump and exposed valve gear with double-coil valve springs and rocker shaft with grease nipples. Induction was through a single 1\\" Amal Type 276 carburettor on a Y-shaped manifold The flywheel was positioned outside the left case, and the camshaft was positioned behind the cylinder bank. The engine was positioned offset to the right in the frame. The four-speed gearbox was bolted to the back of the engine crankcase and was powered by double- helical gears, and a nine-plate clutch. The engine ran \\"backward\\", or counter to the rear wheel. Shifting was initially by hand, but was changed to a foot- shift system in 1935. The engine oil filter was mounted behind the gearbox. The 6/1 had drum brakes front and rear. The brakes were linked, and the rear wheel had a ratcheted \\"parking brake\\". Achievements and awards Harry Perry, Triumph's sales manager, entered a Triumph 6/1 attached to a Triumph Gloria sidecar in the 1933 International Six Days Trial. Time lost repairing a front tyre cost him a gold medal; Perry returned to England with a silver medal in the sidecar class. The combination was then taken to Brooklands and, under the supervision of the Auto Cycle Union (ACU), was ridden in 498 minutes. This test won Triumph the 1933 Maudes Trophy. Reception Speed Twin and 6/1 At ¬£76, the 6/1 was Triumph's most expensive motorcycle in 1934. It was expensive to produce and, with no parts interchangeable with any other Triumph motorcycle, there was no way to spread the costs out. The heavyweight motorcycle/sidecar market for which the 6/1 had been developed was giving way to light motor cars like the Austin Seven, the Morris Eight, and Triumph's own Super 9. As a result, the 6/1 was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1935. Estimates of the total number built vary between 100 and 600. Legacy Despite its achievements and awards, and despite being the first parallel-twin motorcycle from a manufacturer well known for parallel- twin motorcycles, the 6/1 is little remembered, having been overshadowed by Edward Turner's later and more successful Triumph Speed Twin.

The center village is the town's most densely populated area, with a history dating to the town's founding in 1735. The district extends along Turnpike Road (New Hampshire Route 124) between King and Porter Roads, and southward in a roughly triangular shape, the southern point of which is at the junction of Main Street (New Hampshire Route 123A) and Willard Road. The village includes a large number of residences, which were mainly agricultural at first, but also include a number of properties built as summer resort houses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It also includes most of the town's historic civic buildings, including its historic town hall, and the Barrett House, now a museum property owned by Historic New England. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. New Ipswich was settled in the 1730s by settlers from Ipswich, Massachusetts. Their title was uncertain due to land grant claims by the heirs of New Hampshire's original grantee, John Mason, and most of the settlers fled the town during King George's War in the 1740s. New land grants were made after the war ended, and serious settlement began around 1750. The village center area was originally part of two farms, with the town center laid out near the southern end of the historic district, where the first meeting house, cemetery, and parsonage were built in the 1750s and 1760s. A secondary school academy was founded in 1789; its early building, also located near the town center, has been converted into a residence.

The 1-1/2 story wood frame structure was built in 1817 to serve the dual purpose of providing a town meeting place, and to provide space for a private academy. The building has been little altered since 1869, when it was substantially reconfigured solely for town use. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The New Ipswich Town Hall stands near the southern end of the village center, at the junction of Main and Willard Streets, across from the Congregational church. It is a tall 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The corners have broad paneled pilasters, which rise to an entablature and pedimented gable. The gable has a round-arch window near its peak. The rest of the facade consists of tall sash windows flanking the main entrance: the windows are topped by projecting cornices, while the entrance is framed by pilasters and a corniced entablature. The interior of the building has a narrow vestibule, which provides access to the main hall, a closet, and stairs rising to a gallery that extends across the eastern side of the hall. The hall was built in 1817 as a cooperative venture between the town and the local academy, which had been founded in 1787. It was built with two full stories, and a tower with belfry, much in the manner of typical New England churches of the period. The academy eventually moved to another building, and the town made significant alterations in the 1869, enlarging its footprint, removing the tower's cupola, and removing the second floor to provide a single, high-ceilinged auditorium. The exterior also received a number of Greek Revival features at this time, and has seen little alteration since then. The building is still owned by the town, and is used occasionally for civic functions.

The attack, in which gunmen fired on 17 electrical transformers, resulted in more than $15 million worth of equipment damage, but it had little impact on the station's electrical power supply. Assault On the morning of April 16, 2013, a team of gunmen, using rifles, opened fire on the Metcalf Transmission Substation, severely damaging 17 transformers. =Preparation= Prior to the attack, a series of fiber- optic telecommunications cables operated by AT&T; were cut by the culprits. Additionally, following the attack, investigators found small piles of rocks near to where the shots had been fired, the type of formations that can be used to scout firing positions. =Timeline= 12:58 a.m. ‚Äì AT&T; fiber- optic telecommunications cables were cut not far from U.S. Route 101 just outside south San Jose. * 1:07 a.m. ‚Äì Some customers of Level 3 Communications, an Internet service provider, lost service. Cables in its vault near the Metcalf substation were also cut. * 1:31 a.m. ‚Äì A surveillance camera pointed along a chain-link fence around the substation recorded a streak of light that investigators from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office think was a signal from a waved flashlight. It was followed by the muzzle flash of rifles and sparks from bullets hitting the fence. * 1:37 a.m. ‚Äì PG&E; received an alarm from motion sensors at the substation, possibly from bullets grazing the fence. * 1:41 a.m. ‚Äì Santa Clara County Sheriff's department received a 911 call about gunfire, sent by an engineer at a nearby power plant that still had phone service. * 1:45 a.m. ‚Äì The first bank of transformers, riddled with bullet holes and having leaked of oil, overheated, whereupon PG&E;'s control center about north received an equipment-failure alarm. * 1:50 a.m. ‚Äì Another apparent flashlight signal, caught on film, marked the end of the attack. More than 100 expended 7.62√ó39mm cases were later found at the site. * 1:51 a.m. ‚Äì Law-enforcement officers arrived, but found everything quiet. Unable to get past the locked fence and seeing nothing suspicious, they left. * 3:15 a.m. ‚Äì A PG&E; worker arrived to survey the damage. =Sophistication of attack= Former Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Jon Wellinghoff stated that military experts informed him that the assault looked like a \\"professional job\\", noting that no fingerprints were discovered on the empty casings. He has described the attack as \\"the most significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the grid that has ever occurred\\". Henry Waxman, a ranking member of the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, stated that the attack was \\"an unprecedented and sophisticated attack on an electric grid substation with military-style weapons. Communications were disrupted. The attack inflicted substantial damage. It took weeks to replace the damaged parts. Under slightly different conditions, there could have been serious power outages or worse.\\" Aftermath Seventeen transformers were seriously damaged, requiring over $15 million worth of repairs. To avert a black-out, energy grid officials were forced to reroute power from nearby Silicon Valley-based power plants. While some nearby neighborhoods temporarily lost power, ‚Äúthe big users weren‚Äôt even aware Metcalf had happened‚Äù, according to an expert from the Electric Power Research Institute. Both PG&E;, the company which operated the transformers, and AT&T; offered $250,000 rewards for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators of the attack. In June 2014, PG&E; announced that it intended to spend $100 million over a three-year span on upgrading security at substations throughout its territory, including the Metcalf location. A July 2014 report from the Congressional Research Service titled Physical Security of the U.S. Power Grid: High-Voltage Transformer Substations repeatedly cited the attack and noted that, \\"... in the wake of the Metcalf incident, the FERC has ordered the imposition of mandatory physical security standards (for substations) in 2014.\\" Investigation In October 2015, it was reported that the Department of Homeland Security had found indications that the attack may have been committed by \\"an insider\\". Precursor publications In 2012, the National Research Council of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a declassified report prepared in 2007 for the United States Department of Homeland Security that highlighted the vulnerability of the national electric grid from damage to high voltage transformers.

The play ran on Broadway at Richard Rodgers Theatre from September 19 to December 8, 2013 for 93 regular performances after 27 previews starting on August 24 with Orlando Bloom and Condola RashƒÅd in the starring roles. On November 27, two performances of the production were filmed with nine cameras in high definition, and these performances were scheduled to be released in 2000 theatres on February 13 for the Valentine's Day week in 2014 in the United States. The United Kingdom theatrical release date was April 1. Orlando Bloom starred as Romeo. This production depicts Romeo and his Montague family with white actors, while Juliet and her Capulet family are depicted with black actors. The production was a modernization featuring a Triumph motorcycle and zip-up jackets. The show marked Bloom's Broadway debut, and although Rashad had earned Tony Award nominations for both of her two prior Broadway roles, it was the first professional Shakespeare production for both stars. Therefore, the actors hired Patsy Rodenburg of Guildhall School of Music and Drama as a Shakespearean voice instructor. Critical response The play was met with modest reviews. Broadwayworld.com critic, Michael Dale, viewed the work as \\"lacking\\" in many respects. Despite the fact that Director David Leveaux uses a grand entrance for star Bloom on a motorcycle, the show is mostly \\"stale\\" according to Terry Teachout of The Wall Street Journal. The Hollywood Reporter David Rooney described the production as \\"snoozy\\". Nonetheless the film received a fresh rating from 5 out of 6 reviewers at Rotten Tomatoes.

Built in 1935 for a wealthy widow, it is a locally rare example of a house built expressly as a summer residence. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. It is now maintained by the Beaver Brook Association as an event facility. Description and history The Marion Nichols Summer House is located in a rural setting behind the Hollis school complex on the west side of New Hampshire Route 122 south of the village center. The main house is an L-shaped two-story wood frame structure. It is stylistically eclectic, with Tudor Revival features (including diamond-paned windows), Craftsman elements, and Colonial Revival elements. The interior is finished in a somewhat rustic style, with vertical pine siding in the living room, and possibly recycled timbers in the ceiling. The property also includes a c. 1940 single-story structure which originally housed a workshop and a billiard room, and a small brick wellhouse built about the same time as the house. The house was built in 1935 for Marion Poole Nichols, a wealthy widow whose family had been summering in Hollis for some years, typically staying at the family homestead on Main Street. With growing families, that space had become cramped, and the family purchased the Buttonwood farm, where they built this house as a retreat for the aging matriarch. Marion Nichols did not use the house very much, and formally conveyed it to her children in 1949. The family established the Beaver Brook Association in 1964 to preserve the rural landscape of the area, with this house property as one of its seeds. The association now manages more than of land, and uses the facilities here for corporate and social events.

It was named the Best Luxury Wellness Spa in Europe by the international World Luxury Hotel Awards in 2016. History Skodsborg Sanatorium in 1910 Skodsborg Sanatorium was founded by the physician Carl Ottesen and the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1898. Ottesen's inspiration came from John Harvey Kellogg for whom he had worked at the Health Reform Institute. Back in Denmark, he first opened Frydenstrand Sanatorium in association with the Adventist Church's folk high school in Frederikshavn. In 1897, he purchased two buildings in Skodsborg which had previously served as a summer retreat for King Frederick VII and Countess Danner. Skodsborg sanatorium opened in 1889 where Ottesen also founded Den Sanit√¶re F√∏revarefabrik (The Sanitary Food Factory). The new sanatorium had originally room for 20 patients but was expanded with a new main building in 1907 when the remaining part of the royal summer residence, Villa Rex, was also acquired. The institution became colloquially known as Den Hvide By (The White Town) or Persilleslottet (Parsley Palace) due to the vegetarian diet that was served to the patients. The sanatorium also served as a training facility for chefs and physiotherapists. Kellogg visited the sanatorium in 1926. The Adventist Church sold Skodsborg Sanatorium to the Augustinus Foundation in 1992. The complex has been restored and expanded by Henning Larsen Architects. Architecture Countess Danner's Mansion is a 13 bay long detached, two- storey wing located to the south of the main building. The building has a half hipped roof with blue tiles. The building, as it appears today, is from 1952, when the original building from 1800 was expanded by Peter Kornerup. It was listed in 1950. Villa Rex is from 1858 and was designed by Johan Henrik Nebelong. The tower is from 1880. The building was listed in 1994. Facilities The Lobby is a combined lounge, restaurant and cocktail bar. The restaurant serves New Nordic cuisine. The head chef is Philip Scheel Gr√∏nkj√¶r. The modern extension contains a large pool area, gym, yoga hall and test rooms. Garden Frederick VII's grotto In the park to the south of Countess Danner's Mansion is a grotto which was built by Frederick VII in 1853. It is made of reavertine, flint and iron slags. Its interior features imitated stalactites and the floor is decorated with pale and dark beach stones set in a star-shaped pattern. A winding, partly internal staircase on the rear side of the mound leads to the top for good views of Skodsborg and the √òresund. Bibliography S√∏gaard, Torsten : Et halvt √•r i Skodsborg.

The CFPB released new regulations regarding the definition of a Qualified Mortgage that took effect in January 2014, a definition that this bill would modify. The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was a nationwide banking emergency that triggered the recession of 2008, through subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, resulting in the devaluation of the attendant securities. These mortgage- backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) initially offered attractive rates of return due to the higher interest rates on the mortgages; however, the lower credit quality ultimately caused massive defaults.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapter 3 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). While elements of the crisis first became more visible during 2007, several major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008, with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession. There were many causes of the crisis, with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions, regulators, credit agencies, government housing policies, and consumers, among others.Financial Inquiry Commission- Final Report-Retrieved February 2013 A proximate cause was the rise in subprime lending. The percentage of lower-quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8% or lower range to approximately 20% from 2004 to 2006, with much higher ratios in some parts of the U.S.Michael Simkovic, Competition and Crisis in Mortgage SecuritizationHarvard University-The State of the Nation's Housing-2008-See Figure 4-Page 4 A high percentage of these subprime mortgages, over 90% in 2006 for example, were adjustable-rate mortgages. These two changes were part of a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products.Michael Burry-Vanderbilt Magazine-Missteps to Mayhem-Summer 2011 Further, U.S. households had become increasingly indebted, with the ratio of debt to disposable personal income rising from 77% in 1990 to 127% at the end of 2007, much of this increase mortgage-related. When U.S. home prices declined steeply after peaking in mid-2006, it became more difficult for borrowers to refinance their loans. As adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates (causing higher monthly payments), mortgage delinquencies soared. Securities backed with mortgages, including subprime mortgages, widely held by financial firms globally, lost most of their value. Global investors also drastically reduced purchases of mortgage-backed debt and other securities as part of a decline in the capacity and willingness of the private financial system to support lending. Concerns about the soundness of U.S. credit and financial markets led to tightening credit around the world and slowing economic growth in the U.S. and Europe. The Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed in 2010 was a legislative response to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 (which the subprime mortgage crisis was a major part of) and the subsequent Great Recession. Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an independent agency of the United States government responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. Its jurisdiction includes banks, credit unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage-servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, debt collectors and other financial companies operating in the United States. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Mortgage Choice Act of 2013 would amend the Truth in Lending Act with respect to requirements for disclosure to a consumer of points and fees information about a consumer credit transaction, secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, but which is not a residential mortgage transaction, a reverse mortgage transaction, or a transaction under an open end credit plan, when the total points and fees the consumer must pay at or before closing will exceed 8% of the total loan amount or $400, whichever is greater. (Such consumer credit transactions might include an equity credit line to which consumer purchases or leases may be charged.) The bill would exclude from the computation of such points and fees any escrow for future payment of insurance. The bill would modify the criteria for exclusion from the computation of points and fees of certain reasonable charges elsewhere exempted from the computation of the finance charge in extensions of credit secured by an interest in real property. Excludes from points and fees any such reasonable charges even though a creditor receives compensation, but only in so far as the creditor or its affiliate retains the compensation as a result of their participation in an affiliated business arrangement. (An \\"affiliated business arrangement\\" is one in which: (1) a person who is in a position to refer business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan, or an associate of such person, has either an affiliate relationship with or a direct or beneficial ownership interest of more than 1% in a provider of settlement services; and (2) either of such persons directly or indirectly refers such business to that provider or affirmatively influences the provider's selection.) The bill would revise the additional requirement that such a reasonable charge be paid to a third party unaffiliated with the creditor. Requires the charge to be: (1) a bona fide third party charge not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate; or (2) a fee or premium for title examination, title insurance, or similar purposes. The bill would modify the conditions under which federal departments and agencies may exempt refinancings under a streamlined refinancing from an income verification requirement that, at the time a refinancing is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan and all applicable taxes, insurance, and assessments. Repeals the exception for bona fide third party charges not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate from the requirement that total points and fees not exceed 3% of the total new loan amount. (Thus subjects such charges to the same 3% ceiling.) Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Financial Services on May 5, 2014. This is a public domain source. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 3211 would affect direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, we expect those effects would be insignificant. Enacting H.R. 3211 would not affect revenues or discretionary spending. Under new rules issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for qualified mortgages, certain costs that are incidental to the loan amount and paid by the borrower‚Äîfor example, title insurance fees, guarantee fees, and service charges‚Äîare limited to no more than 3 percent of the total loan amount. (A qualified mortgage must meet certain requirements with regard to the borrower‚Äôs ability to repay the loan and the loan terms.) H.R. 3211 would exclude insurance held in escrow and, under certain circumstances, fees paid to companies affiliated with the creditor from the costs that would be considered in calculating the 3 percent limitation. H.R. 3211 would direct the CFPB to amend its regulations related to qualified mortgages to reflect the new exclusions. Based on information from the agency, CBO does not expect that meeting the new requirement would have a significant effect on the agency‚Äôs workload. H.R. 3211 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Mortgage Choice Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on September 28, 2013 by Rep. Bill Huizenga (R, MI-2). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Financial Services. The House voted on June 9, 2014 to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion The National Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU) supported the bill calling it \\"bipartisan commonsense legislation.\\" According to the NAFCU, the bill would make changes to a \\"troublesome definition\\" found in the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that currently results in many affiliated loans not qualifying as Qualified Mortgages. According to the NAFCU, this leads to credit unions not offering such loans which causes consumers to \\"lose the ability to choose to take advantage of the convenience and market efficiencies offered by one-stop shopping.\\" The Center for Responsible Lending was opposed to the bill, calling it a \\"bill that would threaten the safety of home loans and leave consumers vulnerable to excessive fees.\\" According to the Center, the bill \\"would allow frees from affiliated title companies to be exempt from the fee limits in the definition of a Qualified Mortgage.\\" See alsoList of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Real estate bubble *Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 References External linksLibrary of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3211 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3211 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3211 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3211 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3211 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3211 Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Mortgage industry of the United States Mortgage legislation ","title":"Mortgage Choice Act of 2013"},{"id":"42898341","text":"Anisancylus is a genus of small, freshwater, air-breathing limpets, aquatic pulmonate gastropod molluscs in the family Planorbidae, the ram's horn snails and their allies.

Described in 1903, these solitary bees are native to eastern North America. Studies in 2013 placed them among the first insect species to use synthetic materials for making nests. They are considered mason bees, which is a common descriptor of bees in several families, including Megachilidae. Within the genus Megachile, frequently also referred to as leafcutter bees, M. campanulae is a member of the subgenus Chelostomoides, which do not construct nests from cut leaves, but rather from plant resins and other materials. Females lay eggs in nests constructed with individual cell compartments for each egg. Once hatched, the eggs progress through larval stages and subsequently will overwinter as pupae. The bees are susceptible to parasitism from several other bee species, which act as brood parasites. They are medium-sized bees and the female adults are typically larger than the males. They are important pollinators of numerous native plant species throughout their range.  Taxonomy and naming  Megachile campanulae was originally described in 1903 under the name Oligotropus campanulae by Charles Robertson, an American entomologist from Carlinville, Illinois. Megachile translates from Greek mega (ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±œÇ) 'large' + cheil- (œáŒµŒπŒª) 'lip'. In Latin, campanulae translates as \\"small bell\\". M. campanulae has been documented to frequent flowers in the genus Campanula, several species of which are commonly referred to as bellflowers. Subspecies include M. campanulae campanulae and M. campanulae wilmingtoni. The genus Megachile is a cosmopolitan group of solitary bees, often called leafcutter bees and resin bees. It is one of the largest genera of bees, with 1520 species in 56 subgenera worldwide.  Life cycle and behavior  As a member of the subgenus Chelostomoides, M. campanulae are mason bees. This means that they use plant resins, mud, and pebbles for nest construction. Typically the females build small nests in pre- existing holes in trees, fences, or plant stems. They will also nest in artificial \\"nest-traps\\" or \\"bee-blocks.\\" They build the nests as a long single column of cells, along a tube. The deepest cells are constructed first, at which point the female lays a single egg sequentially in each cell. The cells are partitioned and sealed using some combination of the construction materials described above. Pollen, sometimes mixed with nectar, provisioned in the cell will nourish the larvae when hatched. The bees are polylectic, meaning the larvae are fed from a variety of pollen sources. Subsequently, after a few stages of molting, the larvae spin cocoons and pupate. They will overwinter as pupae. After several months, the bees will emerge in the adult form. Males typically emerge in advance of females. They will die shortly after mating. The female bees survive for another few weeks, during which time they build new nests and gather provisions. Adult bees are active from April to September throughout most of the range. In Florida, that have been collected as early as February and as late as November. Flight times are typically May‚ÄìOctober in cooler climates of their range. Resin bee larva and a plug from a resin bee nest Solitary bees, such as M. campanulae, do not form colonies. While social insects (ants, yellow jackets, honeybees) work in colonies, leafcutter and resin bees work independently building nests. Similar to honeybees, female bees perform nearly all essential tasks of brood rearing. M. campanulae does not produce honey, but does perform other important beneficial tasks, pollinating crops and wild plants. Although they can produce a mild sting, less intense than that from a honeybee, they are considered nonaggressive. Bees in the family Megachilidae carry pollen on the underside of their abdomen. Unlike honeybees, they do not have pollen baskets on their hind legs. Most bees in the genus are small to medium in size, although M. pluto at 38 mm is regarded as the largest bee in the world. Many bees in the genus are referred to as leafcutters. However, the mandibles of M. campanulae lack cutting edges; it belongs to the subgenus Chelostomoides, which use mud or resins to build. = Synthetic nest materials = In the wild, M. campanulae seal off their cells within the nest with natural resins found in plants and trees. In 2013, however, researchers reported that the bees had used synthetics, including caulk, to seal the cells. Compositional analysis of these materials revealed calcium, titanium, and iron. They resembled polyurethane-based sealants typically used in building construction. It is not uncommon for insects to live inside found objects made of plastic. However, these findings are the first known of insects actually building nests with plastic. With help from citizen scientists in Toronto, over 200 nest boxes were placed throughout the city. Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, and infrared microscopy were employed in identification of polymeric specimens. Researchers suggest the bees' behavior may be an example of adaptive behavior. Since some of the bees were free of parasites, these novel and possibly more robust methods of nest building may offer additional protection. Incorporation of plastic into the walls and sealants of the cell nests appeared to provide some protection against brood parasite invasion. However, use of these more readily available synthetic materials, in an urban setting, may be incidental. In fact, exposure of brood to polyurethane and polyethylene based plastics could be detrimental, as the Canadian team noted, since diffusion of moisture could be inhibited. Some of the brood specimens were heavily affected by mold growth. Additionally, synthetic materials in the nest might hinder the bees ability to move and breath. Toxin exposures and other effects of urbanization are well documented contributors towards pollinator decline in general.  Distribution and habitat  The range of M. campanulae covers a broad expanse of the eastern North American continent. They are native to southern Ontario. The range extends from this southeastern Canadian province, through the New England states to Florida. The range extends west, as far as Minnesota, Nebraska and Texas. A few reports of sightings further west are noted, including presence in Colorado and Montana.  Morphology and identification  Hymenoptera morphology M. campanulae are medium-sized bees. Anatomically, they have a head, a middle section called a mesosoma, and a posterior section called a metasoma. The mesosoma is formed by fusion of the first abdominal segment or propodeum with the thorax. They have both compound eyes and simple eyes (ocelli), similar to many other insects. The mandibles in these resin gathering bees are characteristically lacking cutting edges found in the closely related leafcutters. The males are smaller than the females. The body segments are covered in various aspects with fine short hair called pubescence. The hairs are of varying length, texture, and color on different aspects of the male and female bees. Morphologically, M. campanulae most resemble Megachile angelarum. There are also marked similarities in appearance between M. campanulae and M. exilis. The males of M. exilis have characteristically dilated and hollowed out front tarsal leg segments. The tarsi in M. campanulae are not modified and are otherwise unremarkable. =Females= M. campanulae females measure 10‚Äì12 millimeters (0.39‚Äì0.47 in) in length. Although they resemble M. angelarum, the white banding (fascia) at the apex of the 5th tergal segment found on M. angelarum is absent in M. campanulae. Females can also can be recognized by parallel sided metasoma. Head Front of insect head diagram The mandibles have 4 tooth-like (dentate) ridges, which lack cutting edges. The compound eyes are nearly vertically aligned, but converge slightly towards front of the face or apex. The lateral ocelli are located closer to the compound eyes than to the vertex margin. One each side of the midline, there are distinct ridges (tubercles) located along the margin of the lower facial plate (clypeus). These tubercles are denticulate along the lateral margin. Other facial features include gena more narrow than the compound eyes. There are punctate markings on the vertex and the gena. Those on the vertex are uniform in shape with rough edges, slightly separated from one another. On the gena, they are less roughened and closer together. The frons shows more coarse and closely arranged punctures. Around the eyes, there are fine punctures, closely arranged. There are narrow areas above the clypeus with some shining spaces, but also areas of coarse and deep punctuation. The head is lightly covered with short, pale pubescence. Hairs are more dense on the face. Pubescence is also more prominent around the antennae, gena, and inner orbits. They are more white in these areas. They become more yellow on the vertex. They are sparse on the clypeus. The antenna segment F1 is twice as wide as it is long. It is approximately half the length of the pedicel. It is shorter than F2, F3, flagellomeres. The apical flagellomete is 1.5 times as long.  Mesosoma  Along the lateral and posterior aspects of the mesosoma, the pubescence is short, white, and sparsely distributed. The hairs are more densely collected around the pronotal lobes. There are a paucity of pale, very short hairs on the mesoscutum. The hairs are stiffer, whiter and longer on the scutellum. Punctate markings across the mseoscutum and scutellum are coarse, deep, and closely arranged. The spaces between the mesoscutum and scutellum are shiny and very narrow. Punctate markings are finer on the axilla, where they are closely arranged. The pleura demonstrate punctate markings which are coarse and deep. These are densely arranged anteriorly. The pleura are shiny between the punctate markings. Lateral aspects of the propodeum are dull. They are overall smooth, except some fine and shallow punctures. These are closely arranged. The first tarsal segments are shorter and narrower than the tibiae. Yellow spurs are present on the legs. There are minute and closely spaced punctures on the skeletal plate covering the costal vein of the wing (tegula). The black veined wings are slightly cloudy at the apices and glassier at the bases.  Metasoma  The second through fourth dorsal segments, or terga, are elongated and parallel to each other in orientation, separated by deep grooves. There are tomentose hairs in much of these grooves. There is white banding along the sides of the segments, towards the sides and posterior. The first tergum has a light covering of pale, erect hairs. It is more dense and tomentose at the lateral aspects. There is pale, barely noticeable pubescence on the second through fifth terga. There are depressions along the sides of the apical margin, which lack fascia. There are well defined punctate markings on each tergum. These are deep and distinctive and of variable size. They are close together along the sides and towards the back of the dorsal segments. They are uniformly distributed and coarse textured on the fifth tergum. There are pale hairs covering the posterior edge of the sixth segment densely enough to hide the surface. Yellowish-white modified scopal hairs for carrying pollen yellowish-white hairs, which are pale initially, darken in color along 6th sternal segment. Deep, coarse puncture marks on the sterna are uniformly distributed and closely spaced. The apical margins have a hyaline appearance and are depressed. = Males = M. campanulae males measure 8‚Äì9 millimeters (0.31‚Äì0.35 in) in length. They also resemble M. angelarum. However, M. angelarum have around twice as many punctures between the lateral ocelli and vertex edges. They also have visible front coxal spines and short dark hairs at the 4th and 5th tergal segments.  Head  The compound eyes of the male are very slightly convergent near the apex. There are 4-5 punctures present in the region separating the lateral ocelli and the vertex. The lateral ocelli are not quite equidistant between the eyes and the vertex margins. The clypea show tubercles near the midline. Puncture markings are very coarse, but become finer towards the apical margin. They are very closely spaced. The mandibles demonstrate three dentate ridges. The broadly triangular lower process is located along the midline. The gena are less broad than the compound eye. They show shallow indentations inferior to the mandibular base. Coarse punctures along the shiny vertex are deep and spaced at wide intervals. The puncture marks are not as coarse on the gena and they are more closely spaced. Deep punctate markings at the frons are tightly spaced and coarse. At the lateral aspects and above the clypeus, they are finely rugose. Pale pubescent markings are present on the head. Along the gena and vertex, the coverings are short and sparsely distributed. They are much more prominent and feathery in areas surrounding the antennae and the lower aspects of the face. The hairs are thick enough to obscure surface markings. They are even longer on the gena. The hairs are shorter on the lower mandibular surfaces and process. The anntenae have a pedicel that is about twice as long as F1. The width of F1 is about twice its length. It is shorter by a third in comparison to the remaining flagellomeres. The apical flagellomere is about twice as long as it is broad.  Mesosoma  There are short, white pubescent hairs sporadically distributed along the lateral and posterior aspects of the mesosoma. They are more densely arranged along the upper surface of the prothorax. Hairs on the mesoscutum are short and infrequent. The hairs on the scutellum are longer and stiffer. Deep, ragged puncture marks are spaced closely together across the mesoscutum. The spaces between each punctate marking are less than the diameters of the marks. They are less closely associated on the scutellem. At the axilla, the markings are less ragged in appearance and are spaced very close together. The pleural surfaces are shiny, with puncture marks along the lower aspects being deep and ragged. Higher up, these markings are less ragged and less sparsely distributed. The lateral aspects of the propodeum are generally of a smoother texture, although there are crisp and shallow markings closely spaced. The spine along the anterior coxal aspect is nearly obliterated. The coxa are covered in dense white hairs. The anterior tarsus is dark. There are long brown hairs on the fronts of the first three tarsomeres. The more typical fringe of hairs along the posterior aspect is absent. There is a robust mid-tibial spur. The slim middle and posterior tarsi show yellow spurs. There are tiny puncture marks closely spaced together on the tegula. The black veined wings are slightly cloudy at the apices and glassier at the bases.  Metasoma  The metasomal segment the first tergum is densely covered in long, white hairs. There are circumscribed areas on the second and third terga which are covered very slightly with pale and barely noticeable hairs. At the 4th and 5th terga, these pale hairs are more evident, longer and stiffer. The first three tergal segments are banded with white stripes along lateral apical aspects. There are deep grooves at the bases of all but the first tergum. These segments also show white banding. The margins are keel-like at the base. The apices have yellowish, hyaline appearance. The first and last terga have Punctate markings, which are sharply demarcated and closely spaced together. In between, coarse puncture marks are present of the other terga. They are deep and spaced at regular intervals, with spacings roughly one diameter of a puncture mark away from then next. The sixth tergum has small punctate marks close enough together that they are essentially contiguous, particularly towards the midline. The sixth tergum segment is vertically arranged. It is banded with white fascia at the base. It is covered elsewhere in pale tomentose hairs which darken medially. The seventh tergal segment is present transversely, but not appreciated medially. The first three sternal segments are clearly visualized and swollen at the edges. The apical margins are close covered with dense long white hairs. The fourth segment is unmodified but retracted, so non-apparent. The subspecies Megachile campanulae wilmingtoni (Mitchell) is characterized by larger size , dark pubescence present on the 6th tergum, and darker wings with a brownish tinge. In the female, hairs on the pollen carrying apparatus (scopa) are black at the 6th sternal segment. Distribution is along the southeastern coast of the United States into Florida, where is assumes the predominant form.  Parasites and diseases  Stelis louisae is a nest parasite of Megachile campanulae Megachile campanulae can be parasitized by a number of brood parasites, including Monodontomerus obscurus, a Chalcid wasp. The kleptoparasitic bee Stelis louisae has been found in the nests. Members of the genus Coelioxys are also known parasites of Megachile. Kleptoparasitic bees characteristically deposit their eggs in the nests of other bees. As this behavior is similar to that of cuckoo birds, such bees are referred to as cuckoo bees. These host-parasite relationships are complex and the relationships between M. campanulae and other parasitic species may not be well described. Mold growth was shown to be problematic in the Toronto study, particularly when synthetic materials were incorporated in nest construction. Chalkbrood is known to affect the related species, M. rotundata.  Human interaction  Bee boxes provide nesting locations for M. campanulae and other bees More focus is being directed on interactions between humans and native pollinators, such as M. campanulae. These relationships are complex, involving issues of habitat loss, pesticides and toxin exposures, climate change, and other effects on the environment. The species M. campunulae pollinates of a wide array of flowers and crops. The significance of contributions from native pollinators is gaining increased attention in the wake of declines in managed bee populations. Such declines have received substantial press, especially in relation to colony collapse disorder. In 2013, Oregon Congressman Earl Blumenauer introduced H. R. 2692 the \\"Save America's Pollinators Act\\". In addition, an International Pollinator Initiative has been developed by the Food and Agriculture of the United Nations working group. A similar project, the North American Pollinator Protection Campaign might more directly address issues specific to M. campanuale. On a smaller scale, human behaviors adversely affecting populations of bees, such as M. campanulae, can be mediated in other ways. Many native bee species can be managed with minimal equipment. M. campanulae will nest in simple bee boxes. These are constructed in simplest form by drilling holes in a block of wood. The wood is attached to a post or wall, ideally in an area receiving adequate sun. Holes of different diameter will be suited better for different bee species. Since native pollinators forage in an area within about of the nest, they can increase the productivity of a small garden. Sparse literature has been devoted to effects of pesticides on M. campunulae specifically. However, in general pesticide exposure is detrimental to native bee populations. Bees can be harmed by numerous classes of pesticides including: insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, acaricides, rodenticides (coumarins).  Pollination  Bellflower (Campanula) Megachile bees pollinate of a broad array of flowering plants from different families. M. campanulae has been documented to pollinate the following: * Asclepias ‚Äì Milkweed * Baptisia ‚Äì Wild indigo * Campanula ‚Äì Bellflower * Galactia ‚Äì Wild peas * Malva ‚Äì Mallow * Melilotus ‚Äì Sweet-clover * Oenothera ‚Äì Evening primrose * Lobelia ‚Äì Lobelias * Lythrum ‚Äì Loosestrife * Nepeta ‚Äì Catmints * Pontederia ‚Äì Pickerel weeds * Psoralea ‚Äì White tumbleweed * Pycnanthemum ‚Äì Mountain mints * Rudbeckia ‚Äì Coneflowers, black-eyed-susans * Solidago - Goldenrods * Strophostyles ‚Äì Trailing wild bean * Symphoricarpos ‚Äì Snowberry, waxberry or ghostberry * Verbena ‚Äì Verbena or vervain See also List of Megachile species References  External links  campanulae Hymenoptera of North America Insects described in 1903 Pollinator decline ","title":"Megachile campanulae"},{"id":"42898398","text":"Indentation or indenting may refer to: * Indentation (typesetting), the placement of text farther to the right, or left, to separate it from surrounding text * Indentation style, in programming a convention governing the indentation of blocks of code to convey the program's structure * Indentation hardness, determining the hardness of a material to deformation * Indenting agent, person or company that purchases goods on behalf of another party See also Indent (disambiguation) ","title":"Indentation"},{"id":"42898403","text":"Ether cleavage refers to chemical substitution reactions that lead to the cleavage of ethers. Due to the high chemical stability of ethers, the cleavage of the C-O bond is uncommon in the absence of specialized reagents or under extreme conditions. In organic chemistry, ether cleavage is an acid catalyzed nucleophilic substitution reaction. Depending on the specific ether, cleavage can follow either SN1 or SN2 mechanisms. Distinguishing between both mechanisms requires consideration of inductive and mesomeric effects that could stabilize or destabilize a potential carbocation in the SN1 pathway. Usage of hydrohalic acids takes advantage of the fact that these agents are able to protonate the ether oxygen atom and also provide a halide anion as a suitable nucleophile. However, as ethers show similar basicity as alcohols (pKa of approximately 16), the equilibrium of protonation lies on the side of the unprotonated ether and cleavage is usually very slow at room temperature. Ethers can be cleaved by strongly basic agents, e.g. organolithium compounds. Cyclic ethers are especially susceptible to cleavage, but acyclic ethers can be cleaved as well.  SN1 Ether cleavage  upright=2.65 The unimolecular SN1 mechanism proceeds via a carbocation (provided that the carbocation can be adequately stabilized). In the example, the oxygen atom in methyl tert-butyl ether is reversibly protonated. The resulting oxonium ion then decomposes into methanol and a relatively stable tert-butyl cation. The latter is then attacked by a nucleophile halide (here bromide), yielding tert-butyl bromide. = Mechanism = Saure Etherspaltung intermedi√§r stabiler Carbokationen  SN2 ether cleavage  upright=3 If the potential carbocation can not be stabilized, ether cleavage follows a bimolecular, concerted SN2 mechanism. In the example, the ether oxygen is reversibly protonated. The halide ion (here bromide) then nucleophilically attacks the sterically less hindered carbon atom, thereby forming methyl bromide and 1-propanol. = Mechanism = Concerted acidic ether cleavage  Other factors  SN1 ether cleavage is generally faster than SN2 ether cleavage. However, reactions that would require the formation of unstable carbocations (methyl, vinyl, aryl or primary carbon) proceed via SN2 mechanism. The hydrohalic acid also plays an important role, as the rate of reaction is greater with hydroiodic acid than with hydrobromic acid. Hydrochloric acid only reacts under more rigorous conditions. The reason lies in the higher acidity of the heavier hydrohalic acids as well as the higher nucleophilicity of the respective conjugate base. Fluoride is not nucleophilic enough to allow for usage of hydrofluoric acid to cleave ethers in protic media. Regardless of which hydrohalic acid is used, the rate of reaction is comparably low, so that heating of the reaction mixture is required.  Ether cleavage with organometallic agents  = Mechanism = Basic ether cleavage is induced by deprotonation in Œ± position.Christoph Elschenbroich: Organometallics, Third, Completely Revised and Extended Edition 2006, Wiley-VCH Weinheim, Germany. . The ether then decomposes into an alkene and an alkoxide. Cyclic ethers allow for an especially quick concerted cleavage, as seen for THF: Image:THF cleavage by RLi.svg Deprotonated acyclic ethers perform beta-hydride elimination, forming an olefinic ether. The formed hydride then attacks the olefinic rest in Œ± position to the ether oxygen, releasing the alkoxide. = Impact = Organometallic agents are often handled in etheric solvents, which coordinate to the metallic centers and thereby enhance the reactivity of the organic rests. Here, the ether cleavage poses a problem, as it does not only decompose the solvent, but also uses up the organometallic agent. Reactions with organometallic agents are therefore typically performed at low temperatures (-78 ¬∞C). At these temperatures, deprotonation is kinetically inhibited and slow compared to many reactions that are intended to take place.  Literature  Paula Y. Bruice: Organic Chemistry, Prentice Hall. .

Professional life =Early writing = In 2004, at the age of 14, Matthews launched a personal blog on politics and other issues under the name minipundit. Matthews graduated from Hanover High School in Hanover, New Hampshire, in 2008. He went on to Harvard University, where he studied social and political philosophy, and also wrote for The Harvard Crimson. =Washington Post= Between June 2013 and January 2014, Matthews blogged at the Wonkblog section of the Washington Post, focusing on taxes, budgets, and other elements of US economic and fiscal policy. In October 2013, Wonkblog journalist Ezra Klein and Matthews spearheaded the launch of \\"Know More\\", a new blog under the Washington Post targeted at replicating the viral reach of popular websites such as BuzzFeed. The project's success gained Matthews recognition internally in the Washington Post and externally. Matthews won the Washington Post \\"Publisher's Award\\" of October 2013 for his work on Know More. A leaked internal memo from Washington Post publisher Katharine Weymouth announcing the award stated: When interviewed about the strategy of the project, Matthews suggested it was primarily about publishing content that would be shared and virally-distributed on Facebook: \\"The most obvious similarity [to BuzzFeed and Upworthy] there is in targeting Facebook rather than Twitter. If you look at any site that does well socially, there's just a handful that get their traffic from Twitter. Journalists sometimes forget this because we tend to really like Twitter.\\" Responding to negative comparisons with BuzzFeed, Matthews said: \\"It really irks me when people act like they're better than BuzzFeed, which is an extremely effective journalism outfit‚Äîmuch better than most at being honestly what people are looking for.\\" Klein also rejected direct comparisons to \\"clickbait\\", arguing: \\"There's this idea that there's this thing called click-bait that everybody wants to click on.

Passenger and crew lists indicate that there were probably more than 400 on board; of these, only 88 survived, most of whom were members of the crew. All the women and children on board perished. Arctic was the largest and most celebrated of the four Collins steamers that had operated a regular transatlantic passenger and mail carrying service since 1850. After the collision, Arctics captain, James Luce, first attempted to assist the stricken Vesta, which he believed was in imminent danger of sinking. When he discovered that his own ship had been seriously holed below the waterline, he decided to run her towards the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety. His plan failed; the engines stopped when the ship was still a considerable distance from land. Arctics lifeboat capacity was sufficient for less than half of those on board; when Luce ordered these launched, a breakdown in order and discipline meant that most places in the boats were taken by members of the crew or the more able-bodied male passengers. The rest struggled to build makeshift rafts, but most were unable to leave the ship, and went down with her when she sank, four hours after the collision. Vesta, which initially appeared to have sustained mortal damage, was kept afloat by her watertight bulkheads, and managed to limp into harbor at St. John's, Newfoundland. Two of the six lifeboats that left Arctic reached the Newfoundland shore safely, and another was picked up by a passing steamer, which also rescued a few survivors from improvised rafts. Among those saved was Captain Luce, who had regained the surface after initially going down with the ship. The other three lifeboats disappeared without a trace. The limited telegraph facilities of the time meant that news of Arctics loss did not reach New York until two weeks after the sinking. Initial public sorrow at the ship's loss quickly turned to anger at the perceived cowardice of the crew. Despite press calls for a full investigation into the disaster, none took place, and nobody was held legally responsible. Demands for the introduction of further safety measures on passenger-carrying vessels were likewise sidestepped. Luce, who was generally exonerated from blame by the public, retired from the sea; some of the surviving crew chose not to return to the U.S. The Collins Line continued its transatlantic service, until further maritime losses and insolvency led to its closure in 1858. Background =Transatlantic shipping= In the second quarter of the 19th century the transatlantic shipping trade was revolutionized by the development of long- range steamships. The transition from sail was gradual; shipowners were initially influenced by popular theories that ships could not carry sufficient coal to traverse the ocean. This notion was disproved in 1838, by the almost simultaneous crossings of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's giant paddle steamer and the American . Great Western completed the crossing, from Bristol to New York, in 14 days and 12 hours; under sail, westbound passages against the prevailing winds and current often took five weeks or more.Shaw, p. 10. The first shipping line to begin regular transatlantic steamer services was the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, better known as the Cunard Line in recognition of its founder, the Canadian Samuel Cunard. It began its operations on July 4, 1840, when left Liverpool for Boston, via Halifax, Nova Scotia.Flayhart, p. 19. As the principal transatlantic mail carrier, the Cunard Line received subsidies from the British government and from the United States Post Office Department, the latter a point that rankled with some Americans, who felt that a home-owned line should be the beneficiary.Brown, pp. 18‚Äì19. Senator James A. Bayard of Delaware was among those urging Congress to subsidize a U.S. steamship line: \\"America will soon become tired of being informed of British maritime supremacy ... I suggest that Congress grant a carefully selected American shipping expert a completely free hand to proceed with the absolute conquest of this man Cunard\\".Shaw, p. 11. In 1845 the postmaster general invited tenders for a transatlantic mail contract. The successful bidder, announced on March 3, 1847, was New York shipowner Edward Knight Collins.Flayhart, p. 20. =Collins Line= A cartoon from 1852, depicting the Collins‚ÄìCunard rivalry With government subsidies promised, initially at $385,000 a year,Shaw, p. 22. and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, , was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, , and , were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement.Shaw, p. 25. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships,Flayhart, p. 21. and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine.Shaw, p. 39. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850.Brown, p. 24. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\".Dickens, pp. 3‚Äì4. In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\",Shaw, p. 30. while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Brown, p. 28. Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships.Flayhart, p. 23. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851‚Äì52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the Arctic one of the noblest of ships, and in Captain Luce one of the best of commanders\\".Shaw, p. 43.Brown, pp. 27‚Äì28. Last voyage =Liverpool to the Grand Banks= Map of the Grand Banks area, showing the contrasting Labrador and Gulf Stream currents At about midday on September 20, 1854, Arctic left Liverpool for New York, carrying between 250 and 300 passengers (including at least 100 women and young children), and about 150 in crew. Among the passengers was Mrs. Edward Collins, wife of the line's founder, who was traveling with her 19-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son, together with her brother and his wife. Another party was formed by members of the Brown banking family: William Benedict Brown, son of the bank's president, was accompanied by his wife Clara, their two infant children, and two of William's sisters.Brown, p. 32. A further passenger was Luce's partially disabled 11-year-old son, William Robert, whose health the captain thought might benefit from the round trip. Arctic passed Cape Clear, at the southernmost point of Ireland, early on the morning of September 21, and entered the open Atlantic approaching her maximum speed of . In settled weather she progressed uneventfully, and early on September 27 had reached the Grand Banks, off the coast of Newfoundland.Shaw, p. 83. This area is formed by a series of relatively shallow submarine plateaus forming part of the Canadian continental shelf. Here, the sub-Arctic waters of the Labrador Current meet the warm northbound waters of the Gulf Stream, to create weather systems typified by intermittent mists and fog.Brown, p. 38.Shaw, p. 93. It was the practice for steamers to maintain maximum speeds in these conditions, although before electronic aids to navigation the risk of collision was considerable. Keeping schedules was considered paramount, particularly in the Collins Line where, Alexander Brown states in his 1962 account, \\"there was no room for overcautious shipmasters\\".Brown, p. 39. On the morning of September 27, Luce observed typical Grand Banks conditions: \\"at intervals of a few minutes a very dense fog, followed by being sufficiently clear to see one or two miles.\\" =Collision= Map (1854) showing the position of the collision (upper right) between Arctic and Vesta, (roughly 46¬∞ 45'N, 52¬∞ 06'W) and the relative positions of land: Newfoundland, Halifax, Quebec, New York At noon on September 27, Luce calculated the ship's position at roughly south-east of Cape Race, in Newfoundland.Flayhart, p. 24. Shortly afterwards, as Arctic slipped into a bank of fog, the lookout saw the shape of a steamer bearing down at a rate of around 10 knots. He gave the warning; the officer of the watch commanded \\"Hard-a-starboard\\", and ordered the engine room to stop and reverse.Flayhart, pp. 24‚Äì25. In the chartroom, the captain heard these orders and returned to the deck, just as Arctic was struck by the advancing steamer on the starboard side, between the bow and the paddle wheel.Brown, p. 40. Luce's first impression was that his ship was \\"relatively uninjured\\", and to most of those on board, the bump seemed slight. Many of the passengers were gathered in the cabin prior to lunch, and some of them were engaged in drawing the numbers of the daily lottery, based on the number of miles run in the preceding twenty-four hours.Kingston, p. 144. In the saloon, passenger William Gihon \\"perceived a slight shock, although it was scarcely more than a tremor or a quiver\\". He continued his conversation with a fellow-passenger: \\"Neither of us entertained any idea at that time that the Arctic had sustained injury\\". The steamer which had collided with Arctic was , an iron-hulled propeller- driven French ship used by a major fishing operator to ferry its employees to and from their center of operations at Saint Pierre Island, Newfoundland.Shaw, pp. 102‚Äì03. To those on Arctics deck, Vesta appeared to be fatally damaged; Luce thought her bows \\"seemed to be literally cut or crushed off for full ten feet\\". His first reaction, believing his own ship almost untouched, was to assist Vesta, on which scenes of panic and chaos among the 200-odd sailors and fishermen aboard her were evident. He ordered his chief officer, Robert Gourlay, to lower one of Arctics six lifeboats with a crew of six, and to ascertain what help could be offered; meanwhile, Arctic slowly circled the stricken vessel. Gourlay's boat was quickly away, and another was prepared for launching, under second officer William Baalham, but before this could be done Luce rescinded the order.Brown, pp. 44‚Äì45. He had noticed a change in the movement of Arctics paddle wheels through the water and saw also that the ship was listing, signs of potentially serious damage. Baalham was ordered to make a closer inspection of the point of impact; he found that debris from Vestas iron stem and anchor were impaled in the woodwork of Arctics hull, creating substantial holes about eighteen inches above the water-line.Kingston, p. 145. Two breaches were below the waterline, admitting large quantities of water.Shaw, pp. 111‚Äì12.Brown, p. 47. Unlike Vesta, Arctic was not equipped with watertight compartments; the hull was open from stem to stern.Flayhart, p. 26. =Confusion and panic= Dash for land Cape Race, Newfoundland, the nearest land to the point of collision As Baalham made his inspection, others observed the extent of the damage, and a mood of concern and anxiety began to develop as news spread. With the ship's four pumps working at full capacity, Luce attempted to stanch the leak by passing a large canvas sail over the ship's bow. This, he hoped, could be fastened over the holes in the hull to lessen the inflow of water, but the jagged iron debris protruding from the hull quickly tore the sail apart.Shaw, p. 116. The ship's carpenter tried to stuff the breaches with mattresses and other materials, but the holes were by then too far below the waterline to be reached.Brown, p. 48. Realizing that his ship was in serious danger of sinking, Luce decided to run for the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety while Arctic was still afloat; Cape Race was about four hours distant, if the ship could be kept moving. This decision meant abandoning Vesta, but Luce rationalized that the French vessel was likely to sink at any moment, and that remaining with her might well condemn his own passengers and crew to the same fate.Flayhart, pp. 26‚Äì27. After vainly attempting to signal his intention to Gourlay and his crew, who were being left to fend for themselves, Luce ordered full speed ahead.Shaw, pp. 120‚Äì21. A few minutes later, Arctic ploughed into a lifeboat that had been launched from Vesta. All but one of its dozen occupants were killed, mostly crushed under Arctics paddle wheels. The single survivor was a fisherman, Fran√ßois Jassonet, who jumped clear and was hauled aboard Arctic by a rope.Brown, p. 49. Boats launched As the water in Arctics hull continued to rise, outstripping the pumps, the boiler fires were gradually extinguished. By one o'clock the ship was scarcely moving. Still far from land, and with no help nearby, Luce ordered that the ship's lifeboats be prepared for launching, In accordance with the governing maritime regulations, Arctic carried six steel-constructed boats, one of which had departed with Gourlay. The five remaining boats could safely hold 150 persons, well under half of those on board but with more than enough places to hold all the women and children.Brown, pp. 57‚Äì59. Under the charge of the ship's quartermaster, women and children were placed in the port guard boat, but as this orderly process proceeded, a group of male passengers and crew members rushed forward to claim the remaining places, and the boat was filled. Although ordered by the captain to remain alongside, it was rowed rapidly away.Shaw, pp. 129‚Äì30.Brown, p. 61. A depiction of the scene shortly before Arctics sinking, showing the makeshift raft, several smaller improvised rafts, and an escaping lifeboat On board Arctic, disquiet turned increasingly into panic as it became clear that lifeboat capacity was inadequate. Shortly after the port guard boat's departure, the port quarter boat, with around twelve women and five crew aboard, was being readied for lowering into the water when it, too, was rushed by members of the crew. In the general melee the boat was upended, sending all but three of its occupants into the water, where they drowned.Shaw, pp. 131‚Äì32. On the other side of the ship, Luce ordered Second Officer Baalham to launch the starboard guard boat and proceed with it to the stern, where women and children passengers would be passed down. No sooner was it launched when it was overwhelmed by men, who leapt into the water and clambered into the boat; all but one of these were crew members. With his boat now full, Baalham disregarded Luce's instructions to pick up women and children, and drifted away.Shaw, pp. 134‚Äì36.Flayhart, pp. 28‚Äì29. Meanwhile, the upended port quarter boat had been righted, but despite Luce's efforts to give women passengers priority, it was again rushed by crew and male passengers, who thrust aside the waiting women and cut the boat adrift from the ship while it was only partially filled.Brown, p. 64. While the captain's attention was fully occupied in vain attempts to impose order, a group of the ship's engineers, led by Chief Engineer J. W. Rogers, quietly appropriated one of the two remaining lifeboats. They maintained they required the boat for a final attempt at plugging the leaks; anyone who questioned their intentions, or attempted to board the boat, was threatened with firearms. With ample food and water, this boat left the ship half full, occupied entirely by engine room staff.Brown, p. 65. Of the ship's officers only Luce and Fourth Officer Francis Dorian now remained; virtually all the engineers and seamen had left.Brown, p. 66. Around 300 people were still on board, with a single lifeboat. As a final measure to give at least some of them a chance of survival, Luce ordered the building of a raft. The fore and main yardarms, with various beams, spars and other wooden artifacts, were collected and lowered into the sea where Dorian, in the remaining boat, attempted to supervise the raft's construction. Despite Dorian's entreaties, his boat was rapidly overwhelmed; to save it he cut loose, leaving a final terrified scramble for whatever security the half-finished raft could provide.Brown, pp. 69‚Äì70. Among those who found safety in Dorian's boat was a fireman, Patrick Tobin. According to his later account: \\"It was every man for himself. No more attention was paid to the captain than to any other man on board. Life was as sweet to us as to others\\". =Sinking= With Arctic dead in the water and all of the lifeboats gone, Captain Luce instructed a young trainee engineer, Stewart Holland of Washington, to station himself at the bow and to fire the ship's signal cannon at one-minute intervals, in the hope of attracting the attention of a passing vessel. Throughout the chaos of the ship's final minutes, Holland held his position and continued to fire until the moment the ship sank. Holland did not survive the sinking. His bravery and devotion to duty were noted in several later accounts: the Baltimore Sun called him \\"a conqueror of death. That noble ship had many noble spirits on board‚Äîbut none nobler than he\\". Luce refused to take any action to save himself‚Äîhe had told Baalham, before the second officer's departure, that \\"the fate of the ship shall be mine\\".Brown, p. 74. When he could no longer render assistance to those still on board, he climbed with his young son to his command post atop the starboard paddle box, and waited for the end.Shaw, pp. 151‚Äì52. By this time, many on board had become resigned to their fate; they huddled together for comfort while some sang hymns or recited scripture.Brown, p. 73. A few still frantically sought for means of survival; those who could not find a place on the raft lashed together anything that might float‚Äîchairs, stools, caskets, sofas and doors, while Holland continued to fire the cannon.Kingston, pp. 145-149. Peter McCabe, a waiter on his first transatlantic voyage, later described the scene: \\"Several persons were floating about on doors and beds ... I seized hold of a door which had been taken down to save passengers, and went into the sea, where I left the door and got upon the raft ... A great many persons were trying to get on the raft ... Among the number who were on it I saw four ladies\\". Many were lost from the raft when it fouled the sinking hull‚Äîa section broke off, spilling its occupants into the sea.Shaw, pp. 153‚Äì54. After this, McCabe counted seventy-two men and four women either on or clinging to the structure, as it moved slowly away from the ship.Brown, pp. 92‚Äì93. At around 4:45 pm, four and a half hours after the collision, Holland fired the cannon for the final time, as Arctic sank stern-first.Shaw, p. 74. There were still perhaps 250 persons on board. As the ship went down, Paul Grann from New York, in Dorian's boat, heard \\"one fearful shriek, and saw the passengers swept forward against the smokestack, and then all was over\\". Luce, holding tightly to his child, was dragged deep down by the suction of the sinking vessel. When he rose to the surface, \\"a most awful and heart-rending scene presented itself to my view‚Äîover two hundred men, women and children struggling together amidst pieces of wreck of every kind, calling on each other for help, and imploring God to assist them. Such an appalling scene may God preserve me from ever witnessing again.\\" As he struggled, a section of one of Arctics paddle-boxes rose to the surface, delivering him a glancing blow but striking and killing his son outright. Despite the shock, Luce was able to clamber on to the paddle-box, which provided a temporary raft for him and eleven others.Brown, pp. 75‚Äì76. Survival and rescue =Newfoundland= A short distance from the foundering ship, Baalham's boat encountered the partly filled port quarter boat. The loads were equalized, and the two vessels, with 45 persons in all, agreed to proceed under Baalham's overall command. After briefly considering‚Äîand rejecting‚Äîa suggestion that they should look for other survivors, the two unprovisioned boats began rowing in the direction of the Newfoundland coast. Without an adequate compass, Baalham navigated by the run of the sea and occasional glimpses of the stars.Brown, pp. 99‚Äì100. Many of these survivors were freezing through extensive immersion in the cold water, about ;Kingston, p. 154. nevertheless, they rowed through the night and the next day. Twice they sighted ships in the distance, but were not seen. Early on the morning of September 29 they were close to the shoreline of Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula, and shortly afterwards the two boats landed at Broad Cove, about south of St John's.Flayhart, pp. 35‚Äì36. Bishop Edward Feild, whose yacht Hawk helped to search for Arctic survivors After a brief respite, the party moved on to Renews, a fishing village four miles (six km) to the north.Brown, p. 103. There, Arctics purser, John Geib, wrote a short message for dispatch by courier to the American consul in St John's, informing him of the collision. Baalham hired two schooners; in one, he returned with two others to the location of the sinking, to search for other survivors. In the other, the rest of the group sailed for St John's. When they arrived, during the afternoon of October 2, they were surprised to find Vesta, safely moored in the harbor. Despite the serious damage to its bow, Vestas watertight bulkheads had held firm, enabling the ship to proceed slowly to St John's with almost her complete complement on board.Flayhart, p. 34. Her arrival, on September 30, had provided the basis of the first, inaccurate report of the disaster, in the local Patriot and Terra Nova Herald newspaper, in which it was assumed that Arctic had survived.Brown, pp. 178‚Äì80. The Arctic survivors' reception in St John's was cool, as following Vestas arrival the perception had been that Arctic had displayed what William Flayhart, in his account of the disaster, terms a \\"hit and run\\" attitude. Baalham arrived on October 3, following a fruitless three-day search for survivors. The text of Geib's brief letter to the American consul appeared in that day's edition of the St John's Newfoundlander, while its rival newspaper The Public Ledger printed a more detailed account of the disaster provided by Baalham. Because St John's lacked a telegraph service, these reports had to be taken by the steamer Merlin to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they could be wired to New York. Most of the Arctic party traveled on the same steamer; Geib remained in St John's, on the chance that further survivors might arrive. Merlin detoured to cover the area of the sinking, but discovered nothing; she then proceeded to Sydney, Nova Scotia and reached Halifax on October 11.Brown, pp. 108‚Äì09, 122. Numerous efforts were launched from St John's in the hope of finding more survivors. An English schooner, John Clements, spent a week searching, before returning with Arctics flagstaff but no personnel. The New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, owners of the steamer Victoria, offered their vessel to the U.S. consul for a fee of $500 a day, an action which led to considerable criticism from the local press. By contrast, the Bishop of Newfoundland, the Right Revd Edward Feild, provided his private yacht Hawk free of charge. Eventually Victoria agreed to assist without payment, although an unnamed correspondent of the Public Ledger doubted whether the ship made more than a perfunctory search. None of the ships other than John Clements found any definite traces of Arctic. Some reported that they had sighted debris, but were not able to identify or recover it.Brown, pp. 113‚Äì18. =Huron, Lebanon, and Cambria= Dorian's lifeboat was the smallest of the ship's boats and, with 26 crew and 5 passengers on board, had only a few inches of freeboard. In worsening weather, Dorian improvised a rough sea anchor, which enabled the boat to ride the waves through the night and following day without being swamped. In the late afternoon of September 28 they sighted a distant sail, which proved to be the Canadian bark Huron, bound for Quebec. As they rowed towards their rescuer, they passed Peter McCabe, still clinging to the makeshift raft, the only one of its 72 occupants to have survived the night; he, too was taken on board Huron.Brown, pp. 94‚Äì96. McCabe later recalled that he thought he was within ten minutes of death when he was rescued.Shaw, p. 3. On the following day Huron encountered another sailing ship, the Lebanon, heading for New York. Dorian, the five passengers and twelve of the crew chose to transfer to Lebanon. The other crewmen, possibly anticipating a hostile reception in their home port, chose to remain with Huron and proceed to Quebec, where she arrived on October 13.Shaw, pp. 182, 190.Brown, p. 97. The ordeal of Captain Luce, and others who survived on assorted wreckage, lasted for two days. Around noon on September 29, the sailing ship Cambria, out of Glasgow and heading for Quebec, spotted Fran√ßois Jassonet, the Vesta fisherman who had been rescued by the Arctic after the collision.Shaw, pp. 177‚Äì178. In the following few hours, Cambria picked up nine more survivors;Brown, pp. 86‚Äì89. these included Luce and two companions, the only survivors of the eleven who had found refuge on the remains of the paddlebox.Flayhart, p. 30. The last to be picked up by Cambria was James Smith, a businessman from Scotland, who had survived on a raft constructed from planking and a tin-lined wicker basket. He had seen at least one ship pass in the distance during his ordeal, and had almost given up hope when Cambria arrived. Once satisfied there were no further survivors in the area, Cambria continued its journey to Quebec. Luce spent much of the voyage preparing a report of the disaster, ready to wire to Edward Collins in New York as soon as he reached land. Cambria arrived in Quebec on October 13, a few hours after Huron. The fates of three of Arctics lifeboats are unknown: the starboard quarter boat in which Gourlay left to assist Vesta just after the collision; the port guard boat, launched under the control of the quartermaster; and the forward deck boat, appropriated by Rogers and his associates. No trace of the occupants of these boats was ever found. In mid-November 1854, Gourlay's empty boat was picked up by the schooner Lily Dale, in good condition and with its oars still inside. In mid-December the port guard boat was washed ashore at Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, again with no indication of the fate of its occupants.Shaw, pp. 204‚Äì05.Brown, p. 119. New York Edward Knight Collins, founder of the Collins Line, whose wife and two children were drowned in the disaster New York first heard of the disaster on October 11, with the arrival of the survivors rescued by the Lebanon. Later that day, Baalham's report, telegraphed from Halifax, was received at the Collins offices. The men from the Lebanon were seized upon by the press; their stories, and the details from Baalham's wired account, formed the basis of the early newspaper accounts. At that stage, information was incomplete; Luce was missing and presumed lost,Brown, p. 133. and there were various speculations about the numbers of casualties. The New York Heralds headline announced: \\"Between Three and Four Hundred Souls Perished\\", and: \\"Only Thirty-two Lives Known to be Saved\\". On the basis of the sketchy telegraphs from Halifax, the Baltimore Sun printed the false story that Vesta had saved 31 from Arctics complement and brought them into St John's. This confusion temporarily raised hopes that the number saved might be higher than was immediately apparent, but this hope was dashed when, on the following day, some of Baalham's party from St John's arrived in New York, via Halifax and Boston, with their more detailed accounts.Brown, p. 132. On October 13, Luce's telegraphed report from Quebec was received at the Collins New York office. The news of his survival was the cause of celebration and thanksgiving.Shaw, p. 197. In its first paragraph Luce informed Edward Collins that the lost passengers likely \\"included your wife, daughter and son, with whom I took a last leave the moment the ship was going down\\". That day, the Baltimore Sun reported the loss of the entire Brown party. Luce's account of the rushing of lifeboats, and the early departures of officers and crew, caused considerable consternation in New York, which quickly turned to anger and condemnation as it became apparent that no women or children had been saved, and that most of the survivors were from the crew. The New York Times reported \\"an entire lack of disciplined control over the whole of the ship\\", and that \\"the officers and crew did not do their best towards saving the vessel, which they left too early\\". Paul Grann, from Dorian's boat, reported that \\"all order and discipline ceased on board\\", and that Rogers had threatened passengers with firearms. Later press accounts condemned the crew in increasingly harsh terms; The New York Times referred to \\"a ghastly desertion of duty\\", and condemned the \\"cowardly and dastardly conduct of the crew\\". Scientific American adjudged that the behavior of the crew in saving themselves before their passengers had \\"blackened the character of our marine in the eyes of the whole world\\". Captain Luce, however, was largely exculpated; he had not sought to save himself, had gone down with his ship, and had survived largely by chance. When he arrived in New York by train from Quebec, on October 14, he was greeted as a hero.Brown, pp. 141‚Äì42.Shaw, pp. 198‚Äì200. The probable number of survivors from SS Arctic is 88, of whom 24 (including the French fisherman Fran√ßois Jassonet) were passengers. This figure includes 45 in Baalham's Newfoundland party, 32 rescued by Huron, 10 picked up by Cambria, and a passenger, Thomas Fleury, whose survival was not known until 1860. Alexander Brown names 85 survivors, but includes only 42 from Baalham's party. David Shaw, writing in 2002, gives the total who survived as 87, but does not count Fleury. In the absence of accurate passenger and crew lists, it has not been possible to establish the precise number of casualties; on the basis of published partial lists, Flayhart estimates the death toll as not less than 285, and conceivably as high as 372.Flayhart, p. 37. Some accounts give inflated casualty figures; for example, W. H. Rideing in 1896 asserts that \\"five hundred and sixty-two persons perished\\".Rideing, p. 196. Aftermath After a week of reports chiefly concerned with survival accounts and tributes, on October 18 The New York Times turned to \\"Lessons Concerning Means of Security on Ocean Steamers\\". Among several recommendations were: the compulsory use of steam whistles or trumpets as fog signals; the construction of permanent watertight bulkheads in all passenger-carrying ships; organized lifeboat drills for passengers; better discipline and more training among seamen. Few of these suggested reforms were adopted immediately; calls for steamships sailing under the U.S. flag to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board were resisted until after the loss of 58 years later. In December 1854 The New York Times called for an official enquiry into the disaster: \\"Whatever may be the extent of their legal responsibility, the owners, the officers and the crew of the Arctic are responsible to the public judgment ... They have no right to resist any attempt that may be made to define the extent of that responsibility, nor to deprecate any degree of scrutiny into their conduct\\". No such investigation was ever instituted, and no one was taken to court for their actions.Shaw, p. 203. Some of the crewmen who landed in Quebec avoided questions by not returning to the United States; according to Shaw they \\"disappeared on the waterfronts along the St Lawrence River and found the obscurity they wanted\\".Shaw, p. 190. Luce never went to sea again.Shaw, pp. 206‚Äì07. The sympathy that greeted him on his return to New York did not prevent later criticism, that he had not acted forcefully enough and had, according to the crewman Tobin, \\"seemed like a man whose judgment was paralyzed\\". The captain accepted that his abandonment of Gourlay had been a grave error; the first officer might well have supervised a more disciplined organization of the lifeboats. Luce took a post as an inspector of ships with the Great Western Marine Insurance Company, where he worked until his death in 1879, in his 75th year. His obituarist recorded that \\"his latter years were embittered by the recollection of the terrible disaster\\". The Collins Line continued its fortnightly transatlantic mail steamship service with its three remaining ships, but suffered a further blow when, in January 1856, SS Pacific sank with her entire complement of 186 passengers and crew. Nevertheless Collins went ahead with the construction of an even larger ship, the SS Adriatic, which, after a single round trip in November‚ÄìDecember 1857, was laid up. Confidence in the line had been damaged; \\"people concluded that getting there was more important than luxuriating amid ornate trim\\",Gibbon, p. 10. and public opinion was increasingly averse to the payment of government subsidies to finance the Collins Line's extravagances. Early in 1858, when these subsidies were heavily cut back, the line ceased business, and the Cunard ships resumed their position of transatlantic supremacy.Brown, pp. 152‚Äì55. Vesta, fully repaired, remained in the service of various owners until 1875 when, renamed Amberes, she is recorded as sinking in Santander harbor.Brown, pp. 158‚Äì59. Among memorials to those lost from Arctic, a stone pillar was erected next to Luce's grave, in the Center cemetery at Wareham, Massachusetts, to honor 11-year-old Willie Luce, who had died at his father's side as the ship sank. James Brown of Brown Brothers bank built an elaborate monument in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, to commemorate the six members of his family who had drowned. It incorporates a sculpture of Arctic at the moment of her sinking.Shaw, p. 208. An anonymous poetic tribute was printed in the New York Herald of October 22, 1854. It includes the words: > Another and the steamer sinks. Their doom Is registered. Accusing woman > driven To death by coward man, was heard by Him Who holds the scales of > Justice. Mighty God! It ends with the warning: \\"Vengeance, saith the Lord, is mine\\".Shaw, pp. 221‚Äì24. See alsoWomen and children first Notes and references =Notes= =Citations= =Sources=   * Kingston, W.H.G.

Forming east of Palau on November 1, the tropical depression passed through the Philippines on November 4 and emerged into the South China Sea on the next day. Without intensification, the system made landfall over Vietnam on November 6 and arrived at the Gulf of Thailand on November 7. On November 8, the tropical depression crossed the Malay Peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Bengal. Being a low-pressure area later, it was struggling to develop until intensifying into a depression on November 13. The system made landfall over India on November 16 and caused 16 fatalities, before it weakened into a low- pressure area, and then entered the Arabian Sea on the next day. Meteorological history Late on October 30, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed near Chuuk. On November 1, a tropical disturbance southeast of Yap persisted within the low-pressure area, as well as JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression east of Palau late on the same day. However, the agency soon downgraded it back to a low-pressure only six hours later, when the system remained poorly organised with convection confined to the western flank. Shortly after JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression near Palau again early on November 3, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. Only three hours later, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression and designated as 30W by JTWC, estimating it would intensify into a category 1 typhoon in the South China Sea. In post-analysis, JTWC indicated that 30W had already become a tropical depression on November 2. The low-level circulation centre was partially exposed but consolidating with the bulk of deep convection sheared to the west. At that time, the tropical depression was tracking along the southern periphery of the steering subtropical ridge to the north, and vertical wind shear was weak to moderate, offset by radial outflow and a developing poleward channel. Late on November 3, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression and gave it the local name Wilma. On November 4, Wilma made landfall over Surigao del Sur, Philippines before 04:00 UTC, and JMA began to issue tropical cyclone advisories to the tropical depression in the Bohol Sea since 06:00 UTC, expecting it to intensify into a tropical storm within 24 hours. Soon, PAGASA downgraded Wilma to a low- pressure area at 09:00 UTC. Interacting with the frictional effects by passing through the Philippines, the tropical depression still got slightly organisational improvement, and it began to accelerate westward. Late on the same day, it arrived at the Sulu Sea, as well as it crossed Palawan and arrived at the South China Sea early on November 5. According to the JTWC best track data, 30W was a tropical storm at 06Z and 12Z, while the low-level circulation centre was partially exposed with the bulk of deep convection located to the north at noon. Late on the same day, JTWC downgraded 30W back to a tropical depression for becoming increasingly fragmented. The tropical depression crossing the Malay Peninsula on November 8 On November 6, JTWC issued a final warning to 30W at 06:00 UTC, when the tropical depression began to erode further. Prior to making landfall over the area near Phan Rang‚ÄìTh√°p Ch√†m, Vietnam, JMA stopped issuing any tropical cyclone advisory to the tropical depression at noon, although it still remained its 10-minute maximum sustained winds at briefly. According to the JTWC best track data, 30W weakened into a tropical disturbance early on November 7, yet it developed into a tropical depression again at noon, when the system was entering the Gulf of Thailand from the southernmost border of Thailand and Cambodia. Late on the same day, JTWC reported that the organisation and vorticity of 30W had got better. Early on November 8, the tropical depression made landfall over the area about south-southwest of Bangkok, Thailand. Since 06:00Z, JMA stopped monitoring because it moved out of the area of responsibility. The system arrived at the Andaman Sea by crossing the Malay Peninsula before noon, but then deep convection over the low-level circulation centre dissipated rapidly. On November 9, the system slowed down, as well as easterly vertical wind shear had become stronger over the system located southwest of Yangon, Burma, making it remain partially exposed and disorganised. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) started to mention the system as a low-pressure area on the same day, right before it emerged into the Bay of Bengal. IMD upgraded it to a well-marked low-pressure area on November 11, yet a microwave imagery showed a broad low-level circulation centre with shallow convection as well as dry air beginning to wrap around the western quadrants. On November 13, IMD upgraded the system to a depression and designated it as BOB 05 at 00:00 UTC. As new formative bands developed along the northern and southeastern sectors, JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert again for the better-organised system at 13:00 UTC. The low-level circulation centre became fully exposed but well-defined on November 14, and deep convection was sheared to the northwest by moderate vertical wind shear which was offsetting easterly diffluent outflow. On November 15, JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical cyclone and continued designating it 30W, when the low-level circulation centre was tightly-wrapped but partially exposed with deep convection sheared to the west. It developed radial outflow, but moderate easterly vertical wind shear kept affecting the tropical cyclone. However, 30W was considered as a tropical cyclone only at 18Z in post-analysis. On November 16, JTWC issued a final warning to 30W, as the intensity became below the warning threshold due to rapidly eroding convection. At 07:30 UTC, Depression BOB 05 made landfall over Tamil Nadu, India, and it weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area overland at 00:00 UTC on the next day, right before emerging into the Arabian Sea. Since that, the remnants no longer had a chance to develop as it continued drafting westward and encountering strong dry air. The remnants became almost stationary and turned west-southwestward on November 20, before finally dissipating near Socotra, Yemen on the next day. Impact Depression BOB 05 near Sri Lanka on November 15 =Philippines= Being a weak tropical depression, Wilma did not cause fatalities in the Philippines, but it still damaged houses and brought flooding. In Bohol, 83 houses and a wooden bridge were damaged, as well as several towns were flooded. The tropical depression also caused flooding in Palawan, leading to the evacuation of 146 families. Two bridges collapsed due to the flooding, and a further two provincial bridges made impassable. When Wilma made landfall, 4,355 passengers were stranded in seaports in Visayas, as well as 352 passengers were stranded in Manila. Only three days after Wilma left the Philippines, Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) made landfall over there and became the deadliest Philippine typhoon in modern history. =India= Depression BOB 05 brought a heavy downpour and caused 16 deaths in Tamil Nadu. Two people were drowned by flooding, and one woman was killed by a collapsing wall. Hundreds of trees were uprooted, and many banana plantations were damaged in Nagapattinam following gusty winds. The downpour also brought copious inflows to various reservoirs and lakes in the state that supply drinking water to the people. In Sirkazhi, electric posts were damaged with power supply suspended in most parts of the district, and the roof of a school building flew off due to squally winds. A fish auction hall building near Tharangambadi was also damaged due to strong winds. More than 10,000 fishermen did not venture into the sea due to the very rough sea condition and visible high tides in many places.

These funds are pooled for investment purposes and used to make grants for a wide variety of charitable purposes. History The Community Foundation for Northeast Georgia was founded by a group of community-minded citizens to receive and disburse charitable funds for an improved quality of life throughout Gwinnett County. After a capital campaign provided the initial seed money, the Foundation received a major boost in 1987, due to the efforts of the late Robert D. Fowler. Under his leadership, he and the other owners of the Gwinnett Daily News generously offered a $1 million challenge grant, which was matched by the community. These funds enabled a significant increase in grant awards and provided a solid base for future asset growth. The Board of Directors voted to change the name to the Community Foundation for Northeast Georgia in March 2002 formally recognizing the regional growth from Gwinnett and the surrounding 3 counties of Barrow, North Fulton and Forsyth to the Northeast Georgia Counties of Clarke, Jackson, Madison, Greene, Oconee and Walton. . Impact The Community Foundation for Northeast Georgia and its donors have given back over $52 Million to the community since 1985. In 2012-13 the Foundation received more than $5.5 Million in donor contributions and funded more than $6 Million in grants.

The bill would specify procedures for the department to follow if it fails to meet timelines, cost estimates, or other performance parameters for these programs. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Department of Homeland Security spend at least $10 billion on acquisitions in 2013. A Government Accountability Office study of 2012 found that \\"only 16 of 42 acquisitions programs had approved baseline costs and identified 42 programs that experienced cost growth, scheduled slips, or both.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The DHS Acquisition Accountability and Efficiency Act would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to: (1) designate the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the Chief Acquisition Officer for DHS; (2) include the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Information Officer of DHS in the DHS acquisition process; (3) establish the position of Chief Procurement Officer under the Under Secretary for Management to exercise leadership over the DHS procurement function and to issue acquisition regulations and policies; and (4) require the Under Secretary for Management to take steps to improve the accountability, standardization, and transparency of major DHS acquisition programs. The bill would direct the Under Secretary for Management to: (1) establish an Acquisition Review Board to strengthen accountability and uniformity within the DHS acquisition review process, review acquisition programs, and review the use of best practices; and (2) establish DHS-wide policies to increase opportunities for effectiveness and efficiencies in the DHS major acquisition process. The bill would direct the Comptroller General (GAO) to conduct a review of the effectiveness of the Acquisition Review Board. The bill would establish a process for notifying the congressional homeland security committees of a breach in a major DHS acquisition program (e.g., failure to meet any cost, schedule, or performance requirements). Directs the Under Secretary for Management to develop a plan for remediating a breach and for analyzing the root cause of the breach. Requires the DHS Secretary to submit to such committees a multiyear acquisition strategy to guide the overall direction of DHS acquisition, including a plan to address DHS acquisition workforce accountability and talent management and an assessment of the feasibility of conducting a pilot program to establish a Homeland Security Acquisition Workforce Development Fund to ensure that the DHS workforce has the capacity to perform its mission. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on April 30, 2014. This is a public domain source. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4228 would cost $1 million in 2015 and less than $500,000 in each year thereafter, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4228 would direct the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to improve the accountability, transparency, and efficiency of its major acquisition programs. The bill would specify procedures for the department to follow if it fails to meet timelines, cost estimates, or other performance parameters for these programs. In addition, H.R. 4228 would require DHS to prepare a comprehensive report each year on the status of its acquisition program and would direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the DHS Inspector General to review and report on certain issues related to departmental acquisition policies. Based on the cost of similar activities, CBO estimates that the new DHS administrative procedures as well as additional reviews and reports by GAO and DHS required by H.R. 4228 would cost $1 million in 2015 and less than $500,000 annually thereafter, assuming availability of appropriated funds. CBO expects that DHS will continue to seek to improve its efficiency in acquiring goods and services under current law; we have no basis for estimating any savings in procurement costs that might occur as a result of the bill‚Äôs directives to the department. H.R. 4228 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The DHS Acquisition Accountability and Efficiency Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 13, 2014 by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R, SC-3). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security and the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency. It was reported (amended) on May 6, 2014 alongside House Report 113-436. The House voted on June 9, 2014 to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion In addition to Rep. Duncan, the bill was initially co-sponsored by Reps. Michael McCaul (R-TX), Ron Barber (R-AZ), and Steve Daines (R-MO). Rep. Duncan argued that \\"for years, DHS's purchases of major homeland security systems have been late, cost more, and done less than promised. This bill will save taxpayer dollars by forcing DHS to improve its management.\\" A discussion draft of the bill received mixed reviews from industry insiders. On anonymous insider said that \\"much of the legislation either duplicates or reorganizing existing management processes that are already in statute\\" and that \\"it is time to start to focus on streamlining processes, not creating new, potentially duplicative ones.\\" A different anonymous industry official had fewer objections to the draft bill, but pointed out that \\"there are risks of becoming so over-focused on process that you lose sight of the mission and outcome imperatives... process does not create excellence.\\" See alsoList of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Government procurement in the United States References External linksLibrary of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4228 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4228 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4228 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4228 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4228 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4228 *House Report 113-436 on H.R. 4228 Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Government procurement in the United States ","title":"DHS Acquisition Accountability and Efficiency Act"},{"id":"42898744","text":"Jens Bille (or Bilde; born January 26, 1531 on Varberg, died April 28, 1575) was a son of Claus Bille (1490-1558) and Lisbeth Ulfstand (died 1540). In his time he was a powerful servant of the Danish monarchy; but he is probably best known today as the main scribe of one of the earliest surviving books of Danish poetry, Jens Billes visebog. Life In his youth, Jens spent some years abroad and studied in Paris with his brother Steen Clausen Bille (1527‚Äì86). Their tutor during the journey was Christiern Mortensen Morsing, later Professor of Dialectic at the University of Copenhagen. After Jens's return we find him in 1555 as the Hofsinde at the court of Christian III of Denmark, and here he spent the following year. While at Christian's court, between 1555 and 1559, Jens copied what is one of the earliest surviving manuscripts of Danish ballads, now known as Jens Billes visebog. As Hofsinde he served at Hoffanen in the Last Feud between the King of Denmark and the Ditmarsians immediately after Frederick II of Denmark's accession to the throne and took part in the battles at Meldorf and Heide. That same year, on 3 December 1559, he married Karen R√∏nnow, daughter of Ejler R√∏nnow of Hvidkilde, and the king accommodated his wedding at Nyborg Castle. On 11 December that year he was appointed governor of the island of Gotland, where he spent the following ten years, and defended the island during the Seven Years' War. After the end of the war, he returned to his father's farm Ljungsg√•rd in 1570. In 1571 he had Billesholm built in Sk√•ne, surrounded by a moat. This became Bille-Holmar, which then gave its name to the place Billesholm. Jens and Karen Bille had two sons. It was the youngest son, Steen Jensen Bille (1565-1629), who later took over the farm on his father's death. After Steen, Steen's son Jens took over the farm and he became the last in the Bille line to live on Billesholm.

Following the Union defeat at the Battle of Wilson's Creek on August 10, 1861, the Union Army fell back to Rolla and began building an earthen fort on the top of a hill alongside the present Highway 63 about a mile from the Courthouse. The rectangular fort had a dry moat around the perimeter with 32-pound field pieces located on each corner of the fort to cover any attack on Rolla from the south. It was named Fort Wyman after Colonel John B. Wyman. Colonel Wyman sent out soldiers from Rolla in all directions who captured what they called rebellious residents of the Rolla area and made them prisoners and forced them to clear the Fort Wyman area of the brush and trees by using the ax, shovel, pick, and saw. Four huge guns arrived by railroad to be placed at the four corners of the Fort. The guns were called \\"32-pounders\\". Each gun required a ten-mule team to drag the gun from the railroad depot to the fort that was done on August 18, 1861. These guns were fired only for practice. The fort was a Union stronghold in the Midwest. While it never saw military action, it trained and provided Union troops that kept Missouri in Union hands.

Actually, Auguste ended his signature on the coins and medals he produced with a T and on the documents relative to his identity and civil status (passport) Michaut is written with a T ; his birth certificate with a T ; but on his parents 's marriage certificate it ends with an X. Michot was his ancestors' name who were from Clamecy in Burgundy was born in Paris in 1786 and was brought up in an artistic environment . His father Jean Michaut was a member of a craftsman association with Jean Baptiste ( Jean's brother). They owned a fine art foundry specialized in casting and chiseling, which was located in Paris, rue du Temple.eclatdebois [archive] In 1801 his mother died. By 1809 he had entered the √âcole des beaux-arts de Paris where he primarily found himself very much inclined towards the practice of sculpture. At the time, he was the pupil of the sculptors Fran√ßois Frederic Lemot and Jean Guillaume Moitte. In 1809 he was admitted to take part in the prix de Rome competition but he suffered from a bad chest conditionFerdinand Berthier, L'Abb√© de l'√âp√©e : sa vie, son apostolat, ses travaux, sa lutte et ses succ√®s, avec l'historique des monuments √©lev√©s √† sa m√©moire √† Paris et √† Versailles, 1852, which forced him to give up sculpting altogether. He became a medallist instead. Andr√© Galle ( also known as \\"Galle the eldest\\") taught him the fundamentals of engraving ; his signature was F.Michaut and a Roman lamp upon an anchor was what he used as a privy mark. During that same period he befriended fellowstudent James Pradier also one of Lemot's pupil. On 13 June 1813 he won second prize for the Grand Prix de Rome contestAgn√®s Goudail, Catherine Giraudon, Jean-Michel Leniaud, Proc√®s-verbaux de l'Acad√©mie des beaux arts 1811‚Äì1815, , in the medal-engraving section, the subject being the French Hercules; the Academy had decided no first prize would be granted that year.

Thereafter he was appointed by Napoleon the 1st's government to execute the medal L'aigle fran√ßais sur la Volga under Dominique Vivant Denon's supervision. Auguste Fran√ßois's sonThe son first followed his father's footstep, started out as an artist and was trained as a painter at the √âcole des Beaux Arts de Paris,then he became a man of letters, he wrote a long funeral eulogy, as a tribute to James Pradier, following the latter's burial, who was his father's friend (Auguste Michaut, James Pradier, statuaire, Versailles, Imprimerie de Montalant-Bougleux, 1852).

William I appointed him Mint-engraver and medallist to the Court for three years by a 4 October 1815 royal decree . He had his own accommodation within the Utrecht Mint (the Royal Dutch mint and thereafter in Brussels Mint (1817). He was assigned 2000 Gulden as official salary per year. On 9 December 1816 the king entrusted him with the die- engraving Arthur Engel, Raymond Constant Serrure, Trait√© de numismatique moderne et contemporaine, , √©d.

Furthermore, he produced several other medals including the one that celebrated the union of Holland with Belgium (1815). He was appointed as a member of the Royal Society of Fine Art and Literature (engraving section 1820)Annuaire de la province de la Flandre-orientale, in Gent, and also became a member of the Royal Institute of Holland. He had a portrait lathe imported for him to Belgium. This tool involved a process through which medal portraits could be replicated into smaller sized coins.

But in 1821, his parisian apartment was devastated by a fireLe Constitutionnel, 2 f√©vrier 1821, and he contracted serious injuries in his attempts to stop flames from spreading. He nevertheless continued producing numerous medals and his most successful productions were framed and exhibited at the Salons 1827 and 1831.Explication des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure‚Ä¶ et architecture des artistes vivans, expos√©s au Mus√©e royal, 1er mai 1831, Paris, √©d. Vinchon, 1831,  Medals engraver under the reign of Charles X  By the time Charles X of France ascended to the throne, Auguste Fran√ßois Michaut had the idea of a medal he called \\"vows of the inhabitants of Versailles\\" that would depict the willingness of Versailles' inhabitants, willingness for the return of the King to the former royal residence. Meanwhile, a competition was opened to define how Charles's bust would appear on official medals. Nothing emerged from the first competition, in which he did not get involved. Another contest was then organized, he was requested to mint the 5 and 10 Francs coins of the new monetary system.Arthur Engel, Raymond Constant Serrure, Trait√© de numismatique moderne et contemporaine, , Paris, √©d. Ernest Leroux, 1897, Those personal favors from the government were met with a great deal of disapproval.Le constitutionnel: journal du commerce, politique et litt√©raire, 29 mai, 2 et 3 juin 1825 Indeed, he was paid 44 800 Fr for the engraving of seven systems.He received 25 000 Gulden for four systems in Holland In 1829, he was commissioned by the ministry of the Navy to engrave a medal for the privy council for colonial affairs whose theme was to be \\"Charles X granting the Charter to the Colonies\\". In addition, he executed a medal in association with James Pradier to Louis Philippe1st's glory on which the monarch's bust is portrayed among signs and banners representing the political parties of the days, alongside which the motto \\"for patriotism, he accepts the crown thus thwarting partys' plans\\".James Pradier and A.F.MichautJournal des d√©bats politiques et litt√©raires, 11 ao√ªt 1830, The medal is a dedication to the Republican national guard.Journal des d√©bats politiques et litt√©raires, 12 septembre 1830 He sustained serious injuries to his hands caused by the fire of his home, this had made the process of handling tools extremely difficult for him. He nonetheless endeavoured to overcome what constituted a major hindrance for him by entering a competition for Louis-Philippe's bust on medals but the king did not grant him the particular session that had been arranged for him by the Minister of Finance, judging every participant should deserve the same chance. Jean Nicolas Tiolier would execute the coins instead of Gall√©, much to Michaut's dismay. In 1831, Jean Philippe Domart a former fellow student at the Beaux Arts won the competition. He offered to take on a medal curator position at the Mint then to become an Inspector-Auditor ( a position implying quality-check the Master-dies prior to them getting used for striking the coins ), he addressed to the Mint Administrator various letters concerning how medals should be kept, however his initiatives were unsuccessful. His medal-production slowed down from that period onwards. He retreated to Versailles, in les Chantiers area, rue de Vergennes.  Final work as a sculptor  Abb√© de L'√âp√©e, 1843, place de la cath√©drale Saint- Louis, Versailles. He called himself \\"Michaut des monnaies \\" (Michaut of the Mint )Gazette des tribunaux 25‚Äì26 janvier 1841 p. 304 for he did not wish to be mistaken for a general called Michaux who fought the Napoleonic Wars and lived rue de Vergennes too. He made a living out of annuities, rents from the various apartments he owned in Versailles and Paris and a 300 francs yearly housing pension he had been benefiting since 1832 emanating from the Fine Art and Science Office attached to the Ministry of Trade and Public Works. His friendshipL'Ami des sourds-muets, Journal de leurs parents et de leurs‚Ä¶, , with the Director of the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, Desir√© Ordinaire ‚Äì who was an admirer of the Abb√© Charles-Michel de l'√âp√©e the founding father of free education for deaf and dumb children; he was also the inventor 1770, of the first language created based on a system of signs, ‚Äì led him to produce his very last work . At first it consisted of a bust,Paris guide : La vie, deuxi√®me partie, √©d. Librairie internationale, 1867, however Michaut's father long illness took him away him from this project for a while. But in 1839, he started circulating an effigyL'Ami des sourds-muets; Journal de leurs parents et de leurs‚Ä¶, , of the Abb√© he had executed . A commission was eventually constituted in Versailles, whose function was to supervise the making of \\" a monument √† l'Abb√© de l'√âp√©e\\". Charles Michel de l' √âp√©e was originally from Versailles and the monument was built to help raising funds for the Institute. He sculpted the statue and cast it into bronze at his own expense in 1843.Joseph Adrien Le Roi, Histoire de Versailles : de ses rues, places et avenues, depuis l'origine de cette ville jusqu'√† nos jours, , The Abb√© is represented standing while holding in his left hand a tablet on which is carved the word DIEU (GOD). His right hand is raised up as his fingers are shaping what stands for a D in sign language . A. Michaut, later became involved in Versailles in local politics as a council member and he was there awarded a silver medal for this contribution. In 1859, he sculpted the bas- reliefs which were to be affixed on the base of the statue. The monument, which has been displaced many times, stands today on the site where it initially was, Saint Louis Cathedral square in Versailles.

The episode aired on April 22, 2014 in the United States on FX. It was written by series creator and showrunner Noah Hawley and directed by Adam Bernstein. The title refers to the Jewish parable of the same name. In the episode, the Fargo mafia sends two hitmen, Mr. Wrench (Russell Harvard) and Mr. Numbers (Adam Goldberg), to find the man behind the murder of Sam Hess; the man in question, Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton), is hired by \\"Supermarket King\\" Stavros Milos (Oliver Platt) to find the author of blackmails he received. Meanwhile, Deputy Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) heavily suspects that Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) is closely involved in the murder case, but is unable to convince new police chief Bill Oswalt (Bob Odenkirk) of it. \\"The Rooster Prince\\" was acclaimed by critics, and was seen by 2.04 million viewers. Plot Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers are two hitmen sent from Fargo to Bemidji looking for Sam Hess' killer. An associate named Max Gold points them to the strip club where he was killed and a dancer gives a description, and they abduct a man matching it. When they are later told he is not the one, they kill him by dropping him into an ice fishing hole. Meanwhile, Bill Oswalt becomes the new police chief, and he and deputy Molly Solverson differ on suspects in Thurman's death. She believes Lester Nygaard is connected to the frozen man at the car accident and the killings of Sam Hess, Pearl Nygaard, and Thurman due to the fact that he was seen talking with Malvo about Hess. Bill believes that it was a drifter who killed Hess, Pearl and Thurman during a home invasion. They interrogate Nygaard, who claims that he does not remember, and Bill, a childhood friend of his, refuses to believe that Lester is capable of something so despicable. Nevertheless, Solverson continues to investigate Nygaard in his personal life over the matter and is removed from the case as a result. In Duluth, Malvo is hired to find out who is blackmailing Stavros Milos, the \\"Supermarket King\\" of Minnesota. Milos believes his soon-to-be ex-wife might be the culprit. Malvo notices traces of tanning spray on the blackmail note, leading him to believe that the ex-wife's current boyfriend Don Chumph is the culprit. News of the events in Bemidji reach the Duluth Police Department, where Grimly realizes the car he stopped matches the one stolen there. Unsure of what to do, he converses with his daughter over a school assembly, where she says she would do anything to help, and Gus smiles and says he is proud of her. Reception =Ratings= The episode was first aired in the US on FX on April 22, 2014 and obtained 2.04 million viewers. The show was aired in the UK on Channel 4 on April 27, 2014 and was seen by 1.5 million viewers. =Critical reception= \\"The Rooster Prince\\" was acclaimed by critics. , it holds a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The A.V. Club writer Emily VanDerWerff gave the episode a B+ rating, and said \\"The Rooster Prince is a bit of a step back from last week's riveting first episode, but the reasoning for that is sound: It's here that the show starts to truly differentiate itself from its cinematic forebear. The Crocodile‚Äôs Dilemma teases viewers with the idea that the series might be a remix of the movie before heading off on its own path by the end. The Rooster Prince is the episode where this thing settles both into being its own project and into being a TV show at all.\\" Another positive review came from IGN writer Roth Cornet, whose verdict was that \\"The second episode of FX‚Äôs Fargo gave us another provocative glimpse into Lorne Malvo‚Äôs fascinatingly depraved psyche, as Detective Solverson must fight the tide of ineptitude to engage in a proper investigation. As the game of cat and mouse develops between she and Lester and we are introduced to rich and entertainingly theatrical additional characters this world and story continues to leave me wanting more.\\" The episode was given an 8.8/10 \\"great\\" rating.

She is the author of three books: Aid as Imperialism, The Creation of World Poverty, and Open Borders: The Case Against Immigration Controls, as well as an early autobiography (penned at age 30) called Hayter of the Bourgeoisie. Background and early life  Teresa Margaret Hayter was born on 2 April 1940, in Shanghai, China, the daughter of William Hayter (later Sir William and a diplomat representing the United Kingdom in the Soviet Union, who became Warden of New College, Oxford University), and his wife Iris Marie Grey. Hayter's first book (1971) was autobiographical and was entitled Hayter of the Bourgeoisie. Views = Political views in the 1970s = In an interview with The Sunday Times in 1972, Hayter admitted that Hayter of the Bourgeoisie had only been published because the publisher Lord Longford (of Sidgwick & Jackson) \\"is a mate of my father\\". When asked what she was doing running a \\"left wing\\" bookshop in Leeds, she replied that \\"when the revolution comes I shall be helping man the barricades with guns and petrol bombs\\". The interview was quoted in On the Barricades, and Off, by Melvin J. Lasky. =Views on migration controls and refugee rights= Hayter has been a vocal campaigner and activist for greater refugee rights and the loosening of migration controls in general. Her book, Open Borders: The Case Against Immigration Controls made general arguments against migration controls and also pointed specifically to the circumstances of refugees. In the book and elsewhere, she has connected her activism for migration rights with her anti-racist views. The book is available for free online and has received some reviews. In addition to her books and media interviews and articles, Hayter has also made the case, in academic journals, for a world without borders. Hayter is at the helm of a campaign to close down Campsfield House, a detention centre in the United Kingdom. In March 2007, Hayter refused to share a podium with David Coleman of Migration Watch UK, and supported a petition by local free newspaper, the Oxford Star, calling on the Vice Chancellor of the University, John Hood, to \\"consider the suitability of Coleman's continued tenure as a Professor of the University, in light of his opinions and affiliations relating to immigration and eugenics.\\" =Aid and poverty= Hayter wrote two books on the subject of the world order and its connection to poverty: Aid as Imperalism (1971) and The Creation of World Poverty. In the former, she criticized the lending policies of the World Bank while extolling the development approach of North Korea; the book was reviewed in The Spectator in 1972. The latter book was reviewed by Leading Light. Reception Hayter has been interviewed by a number of blogs and websites. She has penned a column for The Guardian (a UK-based newspaper) and has been cited and quoted in The Guardian and other British publications on issues related to asylum seekers and refugees.

Mar√≠a de Lajara's doom was published in 1699 by Gemelli Careri, in his work Giro del Mondo (Around the World), who wrote (in James Burney's translation): \\"Donna Maria de Lajara, a young Spanish woman, who in returning from Manila [to New Spain], not having patience to endure longer the inconveniencies of the passages, threw herself into the sea\\". Maria de Lajara was very probably a descendant or relative of Juan de La Jara, Maestre de Campo (High rank army officer), who in 1596, after the death of Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, led the initially failed Spanish conquest of the island of Mindanao; if so, she was in all likelihood born in Philippines. The island Since the late 17th century up to the early 19th century, Pacific Ocean charts registered an island named Dona Maria de Lajara, or de Laxara, or even Maria Laxar around 27 degrees North latitude and 140 West from Greenwich longitude (that is East- northeast from Hawaii). As Gemelli wrote, such an island was supposedly near the place were Mar√≠a de Lajara hurled herself into the sea. However no island actually exists in that area and therefore it is presently catalogued as a phantom island. Anyway, given that in early times latitudes were rather accurate, other possibility is that Dona Maria de Lajara island could originally be one of the Bonin Islands, around 27 degrees North and 140 East from Greenwich; where a small volcanic island is at this location; and the longitude shortly later mistakenly moved to 140 West.

His management made Bantam the main publisher of mass-market paperbacks. Early years Dystel was born in the Bronx, New York on October 31, 1912. His parents met in a garment factory, later running a tailors and, his father, a liquor store in Connecticut. As a child, he wanted to play the violin. Dystel was admitted to New York University on a track scholarship, working as a typesetter for The Times. He graduated in 1935 with a degree in advertising. His grades earned him a scholarship to Harvard Business School, from which he graduated in 1937. Career After college Dystel worked on promotions at Esquire and then as editor on Coronet magazine. During his time at Coronet, he helped increase circulation from 87,000 to 2 million. He left the magazine in 1942 to serve in United States Office of War Information where he worked on psychological warfare. For his service, he won a Medal of Freedom for creating anti-Nazi pamphlets distributed in occupied France that were \\"valuable factors in reducing the enemy‚Äôs will to resist.\\" After the war he was hired by Collier's magazine as managing editor, but did not stay with the publication for very long. During this period he also worked as an executive for Gardner Cowles on their Quick news weekly, and became editor of Flair magazine in 1950. = Bantam = Bantam was founded in 1945, aiming to use new technology to produce cheap paperbacks. The company was a success initially, but by the 1950s the market was flooded and warehouses were filling with inventory. Bantam had not had a president for two years and was failing financially, looking at a years loss of over , when Dystel was engaged in 1954 to manage the line. Although he was informed the company was essentially bankrupt, he demanded a cut of future profits, confident he would turn the company around. One of Dystel's first decisions was to buy the paperback rights of Leon Uris' novel Battle Cry, beating rival Pocket Books by promising to have marines promote the book to wholesalers. He pursued a strategy of publishing cheap, portable versions of classic books in paperback form, targeting the school market. Early example included Dostoyevsky and John Steinbeck's East of Eden. He reduced inventory, increased the sales staff, and built a new corporate structure. By the end of the next year, the company was profitable. In 1963 the paperback rights to J. D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye were becoming available. Dystel learned that the thing Salinger desired was to design the new cover, a request Dystel gladly accepted. \\"We‚Äôll publish it in a brown paper wrapping paper if [Salinger] wants that, just as long as the title is legible\\", he remarked. The Bantam edition sold a half million copies a year, reaching 46 printings by 1978. Under Dystel, Bantam became known for its rapid book production, known as Bantam Extras. When the Warren Commission Report on John F. Kennedy's assassination came out in 1964, Bantam got the complete text into production in 80 hours. The work sold 1.6 million copies for Bantam. Later books in the series Pope Paul VI's 1965 trip to the United States and the 1969 moon landing. In total the series spawned 56 titles. Dystel most enjoyed finding new books with the potential to sell millions of copies. He liked stories that were riveting and could be turned into movies. He believed that covers were paramount. His covers started trends multiple times: first red, then white, then raised letters. In 1967 Dystel predicted Valley of the Dolls by Jacqueline Susann would sell a million copies. He was wrong ‚Äì the initial press run of 4 million copies sold out in less than a year and a second run of 4 million was ordered. Dystel bought the rights to The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty in 1971 when no one else would. It went on to sell 10 million copies for the company. Jaws by Peter Benchley (1974), already a fast seller, set industry sales records by hitting 6 million copies sold in less than two years when Steven Spielberg's 1975 movie version came out. The book cover, designed by Dystel and his team, was duplicated for the movie poster. Bertelsmann bought Bantam in 1977 and Dystel retired as chairman in 1980. By that time Bantam was the largest publisher of paperbacks, had over 15% of the market, and exceeded 100 million in yearly sales. The company published 400‚Äì1000 titles a year during Dystel's reign.  Personal life  Dystel married Marion Deitler on October 2, 1938. She died in 2003. They had two children together. Their son John, who had multiple sclerosis (MS), also died in 2003. He was a lawyer and a competitive figure skater in his youth. Their daughter Jane followed her father into the publishing business as an editor, publisher, and then a literary agent. She founded and is president of Dystel & Goderich Literary Management. Oscar Dystel died in Rye, New York on May 28, 2014 at the age of 101. He had been in poor health, and died at home according to his daughter Jane.

She is one of the founders of the e-commerce company Alibaba Group. As of March 2017, Peng was one of 21 self-made women billionaires in China. Career Peng earned a degree in business administration in 1994 from Hangzhou Institute of Commerce, which was later renamed as Zhejiang Gongshang University. Following her graduation, she taught at the Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics for five years. Peng quit teaching shortly after marrying, and with her husband (who would later run Taobao, Alibaba's eBay reminiscent marketplace) joined Jack Ma in founding Alibaba in September 1999. They were one of the many husband and wife teams making up the 1/3rd ratio of women amongst Alibaba's founding partners that the company would later become positively praised for. Her early responsibilities with the company involved managing the HR department of Alibaba, which she herself created. During this period, one of her notable accomplishments is developing the \\"mom and pop\\" model at Alibaba, in which one \\"mom\\" focused on teamwork and motivation, while one \\"pop\\" handled performance assessments. From January 2010 to February 2013, Peng was the CEO of Alipay. Alipay became the most successful payment gateway within China under her management, expanding to over 800 million users as of 2014. As of the end of 2014, it was valued at around $60 billion. In March 2013, Peng took over as CEO of Alibaba Small and Micro Financial Services. There, she made significant progress in searching for innovations in the mobile payments system. In 2013, Peng's name was frequently floated by the Chinese press as a candidate for Alibaba's next CEO. However, another executive eventually got the job. In 2014, Peng founded Ant Financial Services Group. In September 2015, Alibaba and Ant Financial together took a combined 40% stake in Indian mobile wallet operator Paytm, placing Peng as a member of its board of directors In 2016, Ant Financial broke the record for the world's largest private fundraising found for an internet company at $4.5 billion, placing the company at an approximately $60 billion valuation. She also served as chief people officer, the chief human resources officer for Alibaba Group for over 10 years. In this position, she oversaw the approximately 35,000 employees under Alibaba. Peng became a billionaire in 2014 based on Alibaba's valuation prior to its record-setting IPO. Personal life Three years after she began teaching, Peng married Sun Tongyu. She later divorced him for a short period, but then remarried him. Porter Erisman, in his 2012 documentary Crocodile in the Yangtze about Alibaba's early years, described Peng as \\"a funny and down-to-earth\\" leader. Accomplishments As of 2016, Peng was listed as the 35th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes, #35 on their list of Power Women for 2016, and #17 on their list of Asia Power Women for 2016.

A work of speculative fiction, it won the British Fantasy Society's Fantasy Novel of the Year award (the Robert Holdstock Award) in 2013.  Main characters  Tara Martin, a teenage girl who disappears for 20 years and subsequently returns to her family; Hiero, a stranger, supposedly from an alternative reality populated by fairies; Peter Martin, Tara's older brother; Richie Franklin, Tara's former lover; Dr. Underwood, Tara's psychiatrist; and Mrs. Larwood, an elderly woman who counsels Tara. Certain characters' names have significance to the plot. Tara's name acknowledges the story's linkage with Irish folkloric tales of fairy abduction; The Hill of Tara is the traditional seat of the High Kings of Ireland. Hiero's name is pronounced \\"yarrow\\", which is a flowering plant with healing properties and also the name of certain rural locations in England and Scotland, signifying the character's affinity with nature and the land.  Plot summary  The novel takes place in Leicestershire, England in current times. Tara disappears after meeting a stranger, Hiero, in Charnwood Forest. After a long absence, she returns to her parents on Christmas Day. She claims she had been trapped in a parallel reality populated by fairies. Tara believes she was missing for only six months, yet her family knows she has been gone for 20 years. During her absence Tara has barely aged at all, still resembling a 15-year-old girl. But her parents have become elderly and feeble, her brother Peter has become a husband and father, and Richie has led a life of underachievement and substance abuse, unable to recover from Tara's disappearance. Tara's family refuses to accept her explanation for her disappearance. Nevertheless, Tara insists it is true. She also believes Hiero has followed her back into the human world, seeking vengeance on Richie, whose love brought her back. The family employs Dr. Underwood to assess Tara's sanity. The psychiatrist concludes she has unconsciously fabricated her story as a defense mechanism to avoid confronting some trauma that must have occurred during the period of her absence. Tara becomes increasingly dissatisfied with life with her parents and boyfriend, finding it pales in comparison to her supposed experiences in the parallel world. Her neighbor, Mrs. Larwood, claims to have had the same experience, and warns her of the dangers involved in moving between the two worlds. Richie is attacked twice by an unknown assailant, and is later stricken with brain cancer. Tara believes that this is the work of Hiero, who followed her back to the human world and threatened to \\"blast\\" Richie's mind. At the novel's conclusion Tara once again disappears, leaving a note indicating that her departure was voluntary, and done in an effort to protect Richie from Hiero's revenge.

This is similar to the definition of an isotopy of loops, except that it must also preserve the linear structure of the algebra. For this is the same as an isomorphism. The autotopy group of an algebra is the group of all isotopies to itself (sometimes called autotopies), which contains the group of automorphisms as a subgroup. Isotopy of algebras was introduced by , who was inspired by work of Steenrod. Some authors use a slightly different definition that an isotopy is a triple of bijective linear maps a, b, c such that if then . For alternative division algebras such as the octonions the two definitions of isotopy are equivalent, but in general they are not. ExamplesIf is an isomorphism then the triple is an isotopy. Conversely, if the algebras have identity elements 1 that are preserved by the maps a and b of an isotopy, then is an isomorphism. *If A is an associative algebra with identity and a and c are left multiplication by some fixed invertible element, and b is the identity then is an isotopy. Similarly we could take b and c to be right multiplication by some invertible element and take a to be the identity. These form two commuting subgroups of the autotopy group, and the full autotopy group is generated by these two subgroups and the automorphism group. *If an algebra (not assumed to be associative) with an identity element is isotopic to an associative algebra with an identity element, then the two algebras are isomorphic. In particular two associative algebras with identity elements are isotopic if and only if they are isomorphic. However associative algebras with identity elements can be isotopic to algebras without identity elements. *The autotopy group of the octonions is the spin group Spin8, much larger than its automorphism group G2. *If B is a mutation of the associative algebra A by an invertible element, then there is an isotopy from A to B. *If a, b, and c are any invertible linear maps of an algebra, and one defines a new product , then the algebra defined by this new product is isotopic to the original algebra. For example, the complex numbers with the product x is isotopic to the complex numbers with the usual product, even though it is not commutative and has no identity element.

He is known for his two major works, Post Mortem (1968) and posthumously published Br√©viaire du chaos (1982). He is often compared to the philosophers and writers such as Emil Cioran, Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, Nicol√°s G√≥mez D√°vila and Friedrich Nietzsche. Biography Albert Caraco was born Istanbul on 8 July 1919 to a Sephardi Jewish family. His family relocated in Vienna, Prague and later in Berlin, before settling in Paris. He attended to Lyc√©e Janson de Sailly and graduated from Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales in 1939. At the same year, Caraco and his family fled to South America due to Nazi threat and approaching World War II. His family received Uruguayan citizenship and converted to Catholicism. In early 1940s, Caraco published a series of poems and plays. In 1946, Caraco returned to Paris, where he spent the rest of his life. Inspired by monastic discipline, he devoted himself to writing, although he renounced his Catholic faith. His mother's death in 1969, which was widely documented in his work, Post mortem, had a negative effect on his state. On 7 September 1971, following his father's death, he committed suicide. Most of his unreleased works were posthumously published by L'Age d'Homme publishing company. An article regarding Caraco's works and life, written by Louis Nuc√©ra, was published on 4 May 1984 in Le Monde. Selected works Le livre des combats de l'√¢me (1949) * L'√©cole des intransigeants.

History ST 37 was founded in 1987 by bassist S.L. Telles, vocalist Carlton Crutcher, guitarist Joel Crutcher and drummer John Foxworth. Telles (previously part of the punk band Vast Majority) was in the Elegant Doormats, while the Crutcher brothers were in Tulum; Foxworth was in both bands. They were joined by keyboardist Jon Torn of Thanatopsis Throne. The band drew their name from a song by Chrome. A series of cassette releases was followed by the band's first CD, The Invisible College, in 1992. The next few years saw the release of another album, Glare, the departure of Torn, and some other lineup changes, with Foxworth replaced by Lance Farley on drums, and he later by Lisa Cameron (then known as Dave), who had previously played with Brave Combo, Glass Eye, Three Day Stubble and Roky Erickson. Mark Stone joined in 1997 on guitar, and the band released their next studio album, Spaceage, in 1998. That summer, they helped usher in a series of silent film screenings with live accompaniment at Austin's Alamo Drafthouse theater with a performance of their own score for Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis. They later performed another original film score there, for Lang's 1921 film Destiny. Following the release of two more albums in 1999 and 2000, Carlton Crutcher left to form the band Book of Shadows. Mark Stone left in the late 2000s, while Bobby Baker, a member of the Baby Robots and Rubble, joined as guitarist/vocalist in time for the 2010 release of High and Inside. Later, ST 37 added Chris Cones, formerly of Skullcaster, SubArachnoid Space and How I Quit Crack, on keyboards and electronics. The band continues to perform and record in Austin. Musical style ST 37's sound combines several musical styles including space rock, psych, prog, punk, experimental rock and krautrock. In the band's early days, they aimed to combine two major influences: the space rock of Hawkwind and the raw, experimental rock of Chrome. Other influences include the 13th Floor Elevators, Can, Amon D√º√ºl II and Butthole Surfers. Their music has been described as \\"swirling\\", \\"multitextured\\" and \\"mind-altering space-punk\\". In 2013 the Austin Chronicle described the band's live performances as \\"drowning in a haze of guitar and reverb that can drift through cosmically shifting layers of aggressive punk riffs, fuzzed noise, and scalding jams\\".

The characteristics of the peas in different generations could be tracked by using beans. Beanbag genetics is a conceptual model of genetics which was used by early Mendelians, who used to keep coloured beans in bags as a way of tracking Mendelian ratios. The phrase was first coined by Ernst Mayr in describing the work of Ronald Fisher and J. B. S. Haldane who treated genes as independent entities to simplify their mathematical analysis of population genetics. To be able to understand beanbag genetics, the meaning of population has to change. A population is no longer a group of individuals in an area but are is the alleles in an area that assort and segregate separately. All of the alleles become the gene pool. When using the beanbag approach, there are two ways that the gene pool can be viewed. The first is to view the gene pool as all the alleles that represent all the traits in the population be viewed at once. The second, the gene pool could only be alleles for a single trait in the population. Once the alleles are chosen for the gene pool they are selected for at random. Mayr created the name beanbag because all the alleles were thought of like beans in a beanbag. The beanbag full of beans would be considered the gene pool for the population. Studies The paper 'Perils of ‚Äúindustrial gene‚Äù and ‚Äúbeanbag genetics‚Äù' written in 2008 by Dr. Lakhotia, discusses that biotechnology needs to be reassessed before continuing down the path that it is going down now. Dr. Lakhotia believes that overall everything in our genome needs to be looked at rather than just coding regions. We do know that our genetic material forms and organic system that is built by multiple smaller units working together. Since we know that multiple smaller units are used, scientists need to look at more than just the structural gene. We should look at the entire genome because know that even in the non-coding regions of our DNA is involved in the regulatory network. Debate The debate of BeanBag Genetics has been occurring for many years now. One thing scientists have agreed on is that BeanBag genetics is too simplistic and needs to be built upon. Sir Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright are two scientist that were once a part of this debate. Fisher's assumptions were that: traits are determined by many loci with independent effects, populations are well mixed, and mating is random. Wright's assumptions were his Shifting balance theory that included: Random Drift, Individual selection, and Interdeme Selection. As both argue their theories, people agree with Fisher's theory because it works and is a well developed theory. Other people agree with Wright because his theory is closer to the real world and provides an aesthetically pleasing view of evolution. Even though both theories have parts that are right they both are wrong as well. Fisher's theory does not explain the diversity of the world and Wright's theory is just a metaphor not a well developed theory. So how do they know which theory is correct? Even though both theories are right and wrong, they both see a part of a larger picture. Citations References *Crow, James F. \\"The beanbag lives on.\\" Nature News.

He sat on the Agriculture, Ranching and Administration and Complaints Committees. While he left several of his PRI and CNC posts upon election, he became the PRI's deputy secretary of National Social Action between 1998 and 2000, and in 1999 and 2000 he was the CNC's secretary-general in Chiapas. He followed his first term in San L√°zaro with two years in the LXI Legislature of Chiapas, where he headed the PRI faction in the chamber. Voters returned Nazar to San L√°zaro in 2003 for the LIX Legislature. He sat on three commissions: Agriculture and Ranching, Environment and Natural Resources, and Special for Coffee. His two years in Tuxtla and the second term in the federal Congress coincided with a five-year term as president of the CNC in Chiapas, followed by four years as its Secretary of Organizations. As an alternate deputy, Nazar also served in the LXI Legislature, backing up Ana Mar√≠a Rojas Ruiz. However, Rojas Ruiz let Nazar serve most of her term, and as a result, Nazar served almost exclusively in special commissions for the LXI Legislature, presiding over the Special Commission on Ranching and serving on others dealing with southern border matters, the Grijalva-Usumacinta River Valley, and Microregion Development. Nazar's decision to cede her seat was slammed by opposition parties as taking advantage of gender quotas to get women elected and then let men fill the positions. Nazar left this position in early 2012 to take a post as the Chiapas state coordinator for the PRI presidential campaign. Between July 2013 and 2015, Nazar served in the Chiapas state cabinet as Countryside Secretary. His tenure in this position was criticized for alleged embezzlement of 200 million pesos. In 2015, voters in the tenth district of Chiapas centered on Villaflores, yet again sent Nazar to the Chamber of Deputies for his fourth term. He presides over the Coffee Commission and serves on three others: Agriculture and Irrigation Systems, Rural Development, and Ranching.

This, the oldest known English harmonization of the tune, was first published in Day's Whole Booke of Psalmes and widely republished thereafter.Havergal 1854, p. 40. William Parsons (fl. 1545 ‚Äì 1563) was an English composer and copyist from Wells, Somerset. Nothing is known of his early life. His name appears for the first time in the register of vicars-choral at Wells in 1555. Payments received by him around this time suggest that he was also employed as composer and copyist to the Wells Cathedral. Only a few of his compositions survive and most are incomplete. Among them can be cited an Easter antiphon Christus resurgens in two sections, based on a Sarum Rite plainchant; and a motet Anima Christi for three voices, which was originally just one section of a much longer motet for six voices. William Parsons is believed to be the same \\"W. Parsons\\" who composed 81 out of the 141 settings in John Day's The Whole Psalmes in Foure Parts. The Flatt Service by \\"Mr. Parsons of Wells\\" was also probably written by him; the location was added to distinguish him from \\"Mr. Parsons of Exeter\\", whose music features in the same source.

It has a spire of unusual shape and was designed in 1847‚Äì1856 by the vicar, Rev. John Parker. Rev. John Parker The Grade I listed church was designed and rebuilt from a medieval church in stages between 1847 and 1853 by the vicar, Rev. John Parker (vicar 1845‚Äì60). He designed the porches, ceilings, windows and reredos. The idiosyncratic almost detached steeple was designed and added 1855-6 by the same vicar, who also designed and built the two nearby listed buildings comprising the school house and schoolmaster's house (at one time used as the post office). Interior Interior including east window The 15th century rood screen is carved with vines and animals. Parker covered the walls with large scripture quotations. A double-decker pulpit was installed. The church contains a memorial to Elias Owen (1833‚Äì1899), the Welsh antiquarian and author of \\"Welsh Folklore\\", published in 1887, who was incumbent at the church from 1892 until his death, and a number of monuments to the Tanat and Bridgeman families.

Located in Southern Ontario, the agency focuses on the conservation of the drainage basins of the Ausable River, Bayfield River, Parkhill Creek, and Gullies (Bayfield North and South Gullies) watersheds. The headquarters is located in Exeter, Ontario. The ABCA manages conservation and wildlife areas that were purchased for the preservation and protection of source areas and flood plain areas. Some environmentally significant areas are not publicly accessible. Hay Swamp Management Area is administered by the agency. History The former Ausable River Conservation Authority was formed in 1946. There were local conservation organizations in Ontario before ABCA, and some others formed around the same time, but Ausable Bayfield Conservation Authority lays claim to being Ontario's first conservation authority. A community strategy group of 34 people met monthly between 2010 and 2011 to create a conservation strategy for the organization. This community group included local farmers; residents of rural, urban, and lakeshore communities in the watershed; municipalities; public health; youth; and other stakeholders. The Ausable Bayfield Conservation Authority developed \\"The Path Forward: Your Community Conservation Strategy for Ausable Bayfield Watersheds\\".

The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. It was the fourth fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill to pass. Background An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill. Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that \\"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. The bill covers appropriations for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (HUD), as well as for a variety of related agencies. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall. In 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013 when the new fiscal year. This led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, 2013, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the debt limit until February 7, 2014. In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers has stated that his goal is to pass all twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015 before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation. The fiscal year 2014 THUD bill never received a House floor vote. The vote was cancelled at last minute because the Republican leadership had determined that they did not have enough votes to pass the bill due to the objections of some Republicans to spending cuts in the bill. Major provisions The bill would appropriate $17 billion to the Department of Transportation and $40.3 billion to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It would spend $1.8 billion less than in fiscal year 2014. *$15.7 billion - Federal Aviation Administration *$1.4 billion - Amtrak *$6.2 billion - Community Planning and Development programs, a decrease of $383 million Congressional Research Service summary This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.

It was a royal hunting lodge in the Anglo-Saxon and medieval periods and hosted the Witenagemot in the 10th century. Nearby are the ruins of the 14th century St Columbanus Chapel. Roman artifacts and a burial have also been discovered. The site of the palace is now marked by concrete slabs within the grounds of The Kings of Wessex Academy. History Reconstruction of the Saxon palace at Cheddar A wooden \\"great hall\\" was constructed around the reign of King Alfred the Great (died 899 AD) and the \\"community at Cheddar\\" received a special mention in his will. At this time the building served as a minster. It was rebuilt around 930 and a chapel and other buildings were added, becoming a royal hunting lodge. During the Saxon period, it was used on three occasions in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot, an assembly of powerful figures, in 941, 956 and 968, probably for √Üthelstan and Edgar the Peaceful. There is documentary evidence that Henry I visited the palace in 1121 and 1130 and Henry II in 1158. Several expansions of the site took place between the Saxon and medieval eras. Fragments of Ham Green Pottery found at the site were dated to 1200-1220. In 1230 the site was given to the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral. In 1548, when William Barlow was the Bishop of Bath and Wells, it was sold to Edward VI. The remains were excavated during the construction of the school, but have since been re-buried. The layout is marked with concrete plinths. St Columbanus Chapel Next to the site are ruins of a 14th-century chapel dedicated to St. Columbanus. It stands on a site originally built on in the 10th century and enlarged in the 11th. In the 17th century it became a private dwelling that survived until 1910. The building was octagonal in plan. End walls remain standing and are supported by diagonal corner buttresses; however the north and south walls are now only approximately high. Roman remains Concrete plinths in front of The Kings of Wessex Academy mark out the location of the Saxon palace In January 2006, during the building of a new languages block at the school, a grave, believed to be Roman, was uncovered. The grave contained the skeleton of a man, believed to be around 50 years old and pagan rather than Christian due to the north-south orientation of the grave. Various Roman artifacts, including wall plaster and tesserae, dating from the 1st to the 4th centuries have also been found. It has been suggested that this may be linked with the settlement of Iscalis, whose location is unknown.

Herman was born in Huntington, New York and was the son of an Orthodox rabbi. Herman began his career at 1410 WHTG in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and then moved to Philadelphia to become WMMR's first rock DJ. His show, dubbed The Marconi Experiment, debuted on April 29, 1968. The first song played on the show was \\"Flying\\" by The Beatles over the intro of which Herman recited these words: \\"Arise my heart, and fill your voice with music. For he who shares not dawn with his song, is one of the sons of ever darkness\\". He then moved to 95.5 WABC-FM in New York, which would later become WPLJ. Most notably, he later became the morning drive time host on WNEW-FM, where he was on the air from 1972 to 1982, 1986 to 1991 and then again from 1996 until the station ended its rock format in 1998. He was one of the station's best-known voices. Herman was also heard on New York classic rock station 92.3 WXRK (now WNYL). He was included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of notable disc jockeys. Herman has also played the Narrator for several ZBS Foundation radio dramas, starting with The Fourth Tower of Inverness in 1972, and continuing through Moon Over Morocco (1973), The Ah-Ha Phenomenon (1977), The Incredible Adventures of Jack Flanders (1978), Ruby the Galactic Gumshoe (1982), Ruby 2 (1985) Dreams of Rio (1987), The Mystery of Jaguar Reef (1996), and Ruby 8: The Good King Kapoor (2009). In 2013, Herman was arrested at the airport in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, after going there from his vacation home in the area. The criminal complaint stated he expected to meet a woman and her six-year-old daughter, who he allegedly believed was being brought for a sexual encounter with him. He was charged with transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. His attorney claimed Herman was interested in the mother, not the girl. Herman died of an aneurysm on May 28, 2014, in the Essex County Jail in Newark, New Jersey, while awaiting trial. He was 78.

Principled Distance is a new model of secularism given by Rajeev Bhargava. the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institutions and religious dignitaries. He says that Indian secularism did not erect a strict wall of separation, but proposed a 'principled distance' between religion and state. Moreover, by balancing the claims of individuals and religious communities, it never intended a bludgeoning privatization of religion. In India, secularism means equal treatment of all religions. Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law. The western model of secularism is criticized in India for being an outdated concept as Rajeev argued that since Western model was developed when society was more homogeneous but since in the era of globalization, society is becoming more heterogeneous therefore a new concept, suitable for the present situation, is needed. He even argued that since Europe itself is no more homogeneous hence West should also follow the principled distance model which on one hand respects the diversity and at the same time empowers the state to interfere in case of any discrimination in the name of religion. Examples of Principled Distance Article 29 & 30 in Constitution of India seeks a principled distance between minorities as well as majority to protect, preserve and propagate their cultural, linguistic and religious identity through establishment of cultural and education institutions.

After Ellis's graduation from Russell Sage College in 1993 with a degree in Sociology and minor in Women's Studies, she began her career in media through the re-launch of Cond√© Nast. In January 2014, Ellis was appointed president and CEO of GLAAD, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) media advocacy organization.  Early years  Ellis was born and raised on Staten Island, where she attended Staten Island Academy. She and her older brother Spencer were raised by their parents, Barbara and Ken Ellis. During her youth, Ellis was an athlete; she participated in field hockey and was a Junior Olympic swimmer. While attending Russell Sage College, Ellis led a media campaign against the college administration's attempt to shut down the only women's center on campus and, in her senior year of college, Ellis came out of the closet as a lesbian. In 2011, Ellis was selected to attend the Tuck Executive Education program at Tuck School of Business Dartmouth College and completed it in 2012. Media work In 1995, Ellis began her profession in media. She first worked at mass media company Cond√© Nast, which laid the groundwork for her career advancement. Initially, Ellis worked at Cond√© Nast's House and Garden. From there, she moved to New York magazine as a senior manager, then to In Style as a director. Following her tenure at In Style, Ellis launched and directed the turnaround of Real Simple, which led her to Vogue where she oversaw 10 lifestyle group brands. Ellis specialized in marketing and applied her abilities most effectively through leadership roles. Extending the reach of her efforts, Ellis involved herself as co-chair of OUT at Time Inc., the company's LGBT employee resource group, where she led programming to spotlight the diversity of the LGBT community (2008-2013). LGBT rights activism Ellis began her activism for the LGBT community in 1992, when she marched on Washington to support the rights of women and then marched again in 1993 to support the rights of LGBT people. On January 1, 2014, Ellis began as president and CEO of GLAAD, the only U.S. organization working to move lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equality forward through the power of the media. One of the first campaigns Ellis pursued at GLAAD was the organization's 2014 protest against the New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade, specifically the parade's ban of lesbian and gay participants. In an article in the New York Daily News, Ellis wrote about her Irish-American heritage and sexual orientation, calling on parade organizers to end the ban. Personal life In 2011, Ellis co-authored a memoir with her wife, Kristen Ellis-Henderson, titled \\"Times Two,Two Women in Love and the Happy Family They Made,\\" released by Simon & Schuster. The autobiography chronicled their simultaneous pregnancies and road to motherhood‚Äîit was nominated for a Stonewall Book Award. In 2013, the couple was featured on the \\"Gay Marriage Already Won\\" cover of TIME Magazine. Ellis and her wife were also profiled in a special New York Times Style section about marriage equality following its legalization in New York State and were the subjects of The Huffington Post's three-part documentary web series titled \\"Here Come the Brides.\\" They were named one of GO Magazine's Most Captivating Couples of 2012 and are the mothers of two children. Ellis's marriage was the first marriage ceremony performed for a same-sex couple in the Episcopal Church of New York State. Ellis is also a Vestry member of St. Luke's Episcopal Church.

Parrish (also known as KCP) is a bilingual private school that offers Preschool through 12th-grade education. The school is located in Barranquilla, the largest city and port of the northern Caribbean coastline of Colombia. Description Colegio Karl C. Parrish was founded in 1938. It is accredited by the Colombian Ministerio de Educaci√≥n Nacional and the US-based Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, now part of the AdvancED accrediting agency. KCP is affiliated with international organizations such as the National Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta, Model United Nations, and CharacterCounts!. The school teaches a U.S college-preparatory curriculum. Students study for both the U.S High School Diploma and the Colombian Bachillerato Diploma. The school has a strong offering of Advanced Placement courses. History The school opened its doors for elementary students in 1938 as the result of an initiative by American and Colombian families to establish a school that could offer a United States-type education. They named the school after Karl Calvin Parrish, a civil engineer from Iowa who made Barranquilla his home in the 1920s. The first director was Miss Miriam Best. The school has changed its location twice since its beginnings, once in 1946 and later in 1978 to its present site on the old road to Puerto Colombia. In 1964, with the arrival of Dr. Burton B. Fox, the school began to be known internationally and KCP's reputation grew as one of the top performing American schools in Latin America. It became an internationally accredited school in 1966 by the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges ‚Äì now an accreditation division of AdvancED ‚Äì and still holds that status. The first class of seniors graduated in 1967. In 1998, the KCP Preschool adopted a Reggio Emilia approach ‚Äì a specially designed project-based learning environment for preschoolers. It was the first school in Colombia to have this program and has been a model for many schools, both in Colombia and Latin America. Facilities KCP's campus spans over 3 hectares. KCP's library, named in honor of Burton B. Fox, is a two-story building added in 1984 and was renovated in 2012. The Burton B. Fox Library contains over 22,000 volumes, periodicals, and resource materials and subscribes to hundreds of academic databases.

He fled Russia in 1919 and spent the rest of his life in the west, producing ballets for many of the leading western companies of the time. He is remembered for preserving what is now called the Sergeyev Collection for future generations. Sergeyev was born September 15, 1876 in St Petersburg. He was accepted for training by the Imperial Ballet School and he graduated and joined the company in 1894. He was promoted to soloist and r√©gisseur in 1904 and r√©gisseur-g√©n√©ral in 1914.Koegler, Horst, Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet (1st English edition, 1977) He was thus the last ever r√©gisseur-g√©n√©ral of the Imperial Ballet. In 1919 he and his wife fled Russia, as did many Russian ballet professionals after the Bolshevik revolution. It was a hazardous journey and the last leg was from Riga on a British warship. He was not the only one the Royal Navy helped to escape. Tamara Karsavina escaped from Murmansk with her husband, the British diplomat Henry James Bruce, with the aid of sailors of a British cruiser stationed in the White Sea, and Mathilde Kschessinskaya escaped from the Black Sea port of Novorossisk with her lover and future husband, the Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich, with the aid of sailors at a British base there. Not for nothing did Soviet Russia describe the British and other nations that interfered in the Russian Civil War as the ‚Äúforeign interventionists‚Äù Sergeyev brought with him the records of the Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov choreographies of some 20 classical ballets in the Stepanov notation, what is now known as the Sergeyev Collection, fearing that these invaluable records would be lost to posterity in the upheaval of the Bolshevik Revolution and the Civil War that followed. He used these records in his subsequent employment by many of the leading Western ballet companies of the time, and after his death they finished up housed at the Harvard University Library Theatre Collection. In 1921 he met Serge Diaghilev in Paris. He had of course known Diaghilev in St Petersburg when they both worked for the Imperial Ballet. Diaghilev hired him for his Ballets Russes company and brought him to London to reproduce in its original form the ballet Sleeping Princess (now known as Sleeping Beauty) for his financially disastrous 1921 season at the Alhambra Theatre. After disagreements with Diaghilev he went to Riga as regisseur of the Latvian National Opera Ballet. He also founded his own company and produced Act IV of La Bayadere, La Fille mal Gardee, and Paquita, all from his Maryinsky notations. In 1925 the √©migr√© Russian Prima Ballerina Olga Spessivtseva hired him to produce Giselle for her at the Paris Opera. This was a huge success, and gained for him the medal of L'Academie Nationale de Musique et la Danse. Back in Riga he found his own ballet company in financial difficulties, so he joined the newly formed Russian Opera Company as ballet master. The company went on a world tour producing excerpts from classical ballets and operatic interludes. In 1934 this company was disbanded and Sergeyev came to London. He produced Giselle first for the Camargo Society and then for the Vic-Wells Company, with Spessivtseva, Markova and Dolin dancing lead roles at some of the performances. He stayed with the Vic-Wells to produce Swan Lake, Coppelia, and Casse Noisette, and then the 1939 production of Sleeping Princess. He was ballet master for the Vic-Wells from 1937 to 1942, when Vera Volkova took over. At the same time he did some work for International Ballet, the fledgling touring company formed by Mona Inglesby in 1941. When he left Sadler's Wells he joined International Ballet, as ballet master and director of the International Ballet School in Queensberry Mews, South Kensington. He never had a formal contract but it was an arrangement that suited both sides admirably and he stayed with International Ballet for the rest of his life. He had a new company of young dancers to train and rehearse in the traditions of the Maryinsky and a young director who believed in his methods. Inglesby had the only person in the world outside Soviet Russia who could produce the classical ballets in their original Petipa/Ivanov forms, which is what she wanted her company to do. Between 1942 and 1948 he re-created full length productions of the classics Giselle, Coppelia, Sleeping Princess and Swan Lake, as well as some shorter ballets and some short extracts from the classics. He worked with International Ballet until his health started to fail, and he died in Nice on 23 June 1951 aged 74.

Life and work  He was born on an estate where his father served as the Superintendent. After receiving instruction from the local Rector, he attended the Katharineum in L√ºbeck. When his father died in 1810 the B√ºrgermeister of Bad Oldesloe became his guardian. The following year, he became a law student at the University of Kiel, then moved to the University of Heidelberg.WebGallery of Art: Brief biography While there, he was able to see the collection of paintings amassed by Sulpiz Boisser√©e and his brother Melchior, which had recently been put on display. This inspired him to give up law and become a history painter. He entered the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, in 1813. =In Italy= In 1816, he took the traditional study trip to Rome. As his sister Augusta had recently married Friedrich Overbeck's brother , he found quick entry into the inner circles of the Nazareners even though, unlike most of them, he remained a Protestant. He travelled extensively throughout Italy for many years. In 1819, he established a communal studio with Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and Friedrich von Olivier in the Palazzo Caffarelli near the Capitoline Hill. He was a notoriously slow worker, however, and a major commission that was not completed in time hastened his departure. The Summer of 1823 was spent in Florence and Pisa, following which he went to Perugia, where he stayed until 1827. From 1828 to 1831, he worked in the offices of the Prussian Envoy, Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen. Very few works survive from his Italian period. He moved to L√ºbeck in 1832, working primarily as a portrait painter. From 1835 to 1841, he lived in Munich and once again became involved in a communal enterprise with Carolsfeld and the Olivier brothers. There, he worked mainly on religious themes and a series of self-portraits. After another short stay in L√ºbeck, he was hired as an instructor by the University of Kiel, a position that included managing the University's art collection. He became a member of the Kiel Art Association and was on the board of the Gesellschaft zur Sammlung und Erhaltung vaterl√§ndischer Alterth√ºmer (a society for the preservation of German antiquities). He died after a long illness. The Rehbenitzwinkel (mall) in Kiel is named after him. References  Further reading  Klaus Groth und der \\"Quickborn\\": In Zeichnungen von Theodor Rehbenitz.

The music in the workout is primarily Christian hip-hop and Christian rock music. Their fitness program is primarily distributed through DVD. However, they do offer content through online video sites such as YouTube and Vimeo. The beginning level workouts are designed to train muscle groups and offer a combination of isotonic and isometric dance exercises as well as a cool down. The intermediate DVD offers the same features, but is geared toward dance enthusiasts by offering more advanced dance moves. Origins In 2012, McCarley decided to pursue an idea she'd had for a long time - to host local dance fitness classes that used only Christian music. She wanted to create the same passion and excitement that Zumba evoked in their customers, but instead only using fast-tempo, Christian dance music. After additional consideration Kristy McCarley decided that local classes weren't the best path to take at the time. The idea evolved eventually into a structured video fitness program. Shazzy Fitness was named after the story of the Hebrew prophet, Daniel. Kristy states, ‚Äúsince this is a faith- based workout, I wanted to name it after someone who represented strength in faith. I chose Daniel because he is an excellent example of true faith during incredible circumstances.

Their products are intended for various industries, including the gold mining industry, agriculture, etc. As part of the company‚Äôs mission, the measures have been taken to modernize the existing Kazakhstani chemical enterprises and to organize the production of more than 20 new types of chemical products; the development of competitive projects in the chemical industry aimed at the manufacturing of high-tech, export-oriented and innovative products with high added value; establishing of projects to make products which have not previously been produced in Kazakhstan - sodium cyanide, potassium sulfate, polypropylene and propylene oxide, glyphosate, calcium chloride, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, superplasticizers for concrete, additives to oils, flotation reagents, and other products. Background  On October 13, 2008, speaking at an enlarged meeting of the Government of Kazakhstan, President of the country Nursultan Nazarbayev instructed to \\"create a special company that will deal with projects in the chemical industry\\". The Fund \\"Samruk-Kazyna\\", pursuant to the order of the president, established the United Chemical Company (UCC), which became the leading state-owned operator in the chemical industry. The goals, to which the UCC has been assigned to, included the concentration of state assets in the industry and promoting its further development. The priority projects include, among others, the reconstruction of the sulfuric acid plant with a capacity of 180 thousand tons per year, the construction of an integrated gas chemical complex, the production of polymer products in the Atyrau oblast, the construction of the SEZ \\"Chemical Park \\"Taraz\\", and others. Construction of the complex on the production of polymer products in the Atyrau oblast In February 2011, the \\"Development Bank of Kazakhstan\\" JSC and the \\"Eximbank\\" of China signed a loan agreement to finance the first phase of construction of the integrated gas chemical complex in the Atyrau oblast. In 2011, the construction of the gas chemical complex for the production of polymer products has been started. As part of the first phase of the project (polypropylene), a loan agreement has been signed to finance the first phase of the project, designing of infrastructure facilities has been completed, construction works on infrastructure facilities have continued, the work has begun on designing the main process units and on-site utilities, the design and estimate documentation has been developed.

It is one of the few remaining salt marshes on the North Shore in the Metropolitan area; another being the salt marsh southwest of the cove, at Alley Pond Park. For many years, activists and locals have struggled to ensure that these marshlands and wetlands were properly preserved in their natural state by preventing development in the region.

The cove is a haven for birds and underwater life, as well as a favorite spot for school children with an interest in studying them. It contains a 15-acre oblong ravine, which was left behind as a remnant of the Ice Age by a glacier. The ravine measures 200 feet wide, between backyards of single-family homes, and has fresh-water streams in it that feed Udalls Cove. Udalls Cove Wildlife Preserve Park On November 8, 1960, the Parks and Recreation Land Acquisition Bond Act of 1960 was approved by the electorate. December 15, 1960 was the day in which the Board Estimate approved the \\"New York City Zoning Resolution of 1961;\\" it went into effect the very next day. The Great Neck Estates Village Board paid $400,000 for 53 acres of marshland in Nassau County, bordering Udalls Cove in March 1967. On October 20, 1969, the Udalls Cove Preservation Committee was established and its first meeting was held the day after that. On May 12, 1970, the first meeting of the newly formed Mayor's Committee on the Environment was held in the Blue Room of City Hall: Aurora Gareiss was a charter member. An ecological evaluation of Udalls Cove was conducted on August 21, 1970 after the City Commissioner of Parks made a request to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In November 1970, an \\"Ecological Report on Udalls Cove\\" (prepared by Anthony S. Taormina) was sent from the NYS DEC to the City Commissioner of Parks. In June 1971, Habitat 2000 presented a proposal to establish the \\"Terminal Moraine Natural Area System\\" by linking the City Park areas in Queens from Cunningham Park to Udalls Cove with walking, equestrian, cycling paths: this group (which included John W. Kominski, Chairman and Andrew M. Greller, Co-Chairman) sought to establish the position of \\"Curator of the Terminal Moraine\\" in the parks. Udalls Cove Preservation Committee The Udalls Cove Preservation Committee, Inc. was established to serve a number of purposes related to preservation of the Udall's Cove Park Preserve.Certificate, Anonymous, \\"Certificate of Incorporation of Udalls Cove Preservation Committee, Inc.: Pursuant to the Membership Corporation Law, Udalls Cove Preservation Committee, Incorporation and Tax-Records Certificates-Correspondence, 1964-1974 Box 553, Folder 4, Coll.

Stressler. Development and man-made threats In the Daily News article entitled Planners Expected to Approve a Wetland Park, around 50% of these productive marshlands have already been destroyed by man's encroachments or interference into these natural resources. John W. Kominski notes, in his Letter - Audubon Magazine, the wetlands (of Udalls Cove) had become an area of abuse and misunderstanding, and must therefore be protected and realized as a primary producer of food stuffs. The writer of the article From Here to Eternity (also a part of the Aurora Gareiss Collection at the Queens Borough Public Library) has noted how \\"Fifteen dump trucks stood ready to 'improve' the landscape.\\"Article, Anonymous. \\"From Here to Eternity.\\" Long Island Press.

The word \\"improve\\" in this case was referring to how those in charge sought to dispose of these materials in Udalls Cove. However, this article also stated: \\"Between them and the myriad of marine life forms they would doom stood a handful of people.\\" This was \\"a confrontation\\" between \\"those who considered it important to preserve the biotic integrity of a salt-water marsh, and those who considered it expendable in favor of a parking lot or a golf course. This temporary halt awoke America to the kind of choice we must make for eternity. Although this did not necessarily put an end to parking lots and golf courses, it was hoped that after a public hearing in 1970, this temporary halt would become permanent. In 1970, Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall, in response to environmental damages and dumping, stated \\"All too often this is simply because public conscience hasn't been given the basic ecological understanding so necessary to selection of the right alternative.Poster, Stewart L.

Years ago, Udalls Cove was (nearly) eliminated by a golf course; Mr. Sheldon Lobel, an attorney from Woodside, represented two developers who wanted to eliminate a ravine, a \\"hazardous eyesore,\\" by building an enclosed mall opposite St. Anastasia Church on Northern Boulevard. Zoning was and is still one such element/ factor, and is a line of defense which behind which neighborhoods retain their identities, as well as their moral, spiritual, or real estate values. Virginia Dent of Douglaston, however, opposed, this plan and stated \\"We're very upset and we feel it's a rape of the community. It's all right for the Church to make money, but not at the expense of the environment.\\" According to the Reverend William T. Smith, a pastor of St. Anastasia's Roman Catholic Church, the Church bought this property as a site for a high school. However, they decided to sell it without realizing the goal or intent of the developers' project.Article, Smith, Jim. \\"Fighting a Mall to Save a Marsh.\\" Newsday/The Island, 26, Feb. 1974, Memory Book 1973-1978, Box 550, Folder 33, Coll.

Melston, director of conservation and environmental education for the New York City Department of Parks stated that the construction must be stopped in any area of the ravine, as this development would impair the natural drainage pattern of the area, accelerate erosion, add pollutants to the bay, and drive away wildlife. According to a Daily News article, 50% of these productive marshlands have already been destroyed by man's encroachments/ interference into these natural these natural resources. During the early 1980s, plans for a sewer to be built through Alley Pond Park, a four-story motel and an apartment building on the park's perimeter were either approved or proposed within a few months.Article, Anonymous, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Spring and the Developers are Back.‚Äù Little Neck-Glen Oaks Ledger, May 15, 1981 (Friday), Memory Book Box 550, Folder 34, Coll.

Aurora Gareiss stated, in response to how she feared her efforts may have been for naught, \\"Every time we have gone one step forward, we seem to have gone two steps backward.\\" Significant plant and animal life, and the importance of Udalls Cove According to John W. Kominski in his Letter - Audubon Magazine, found at the Queens Borough Public Library's collection, the wetlands of Udalls Cove were described as \\"not only the natural habitat of muskrats, egrets, and the Great Blue Heron; They are also part of the complex biological system which insures human survival.\\" He further explains that the unique elements found within salt marshes like those in Udalls Cove/Little Neck Bay provide astonishing amounts of nutrients, which sustain a diversity of marine plants and animals that populate such this area. Furthermore, he states that as each acre of marsh is lost or depleted, the more likely commercial and fishery resources will decline and become more scarce. In John Toscano's article Planners Expected to Approve a Wetland Park, Aurora Gareiss stated that Udalls Cove was \\"still full of fish and wild life which must be preserved and defended against further development and thus from further destruction.\\" She also described this marshland as both a tidal marsh and \\"part of the cradle of life.\\" In a letter to Aurora Gareiss, Robert C. Murphy described how only 65% of the Long Island salt marsh remained and could not be allowed to disappear.Letter, Robert Cushman Murphy to Mrs. Gareiss, 19, FEB. 1970, Memory Book Box 550, Folder 32, Coll.

Another resource, a newspaper entitled Revolutions Stand Up for Swamp, states how William Brooks, a teacher at Elmont High School, denotes that the marsh feeds 20,000 ducks of Little Neck Bay, and that a person can witness the movements of egrets, herons, Canada geese, marsh wrens, pheasants, possums and other such animals on a quiet afternoon.Article, Behrens, Dave. \\"Revolutions Stand Up for Swamp,\\" NEWSDAY, FEB. 1970, Memory Book Box 550, Folder 32, Coll.

Plans for preservation and conservation In Charlotte Ames' 1970 article, Queens youths have made it their responsibility to understand the beauty and usefulness of Udalls Cove and alerted residents within Douglaston and Great Neck Estates to the urgency of saving this natural marshland. In order to save the marshland, two solutions have been proposed: 1)The Urban Ecology Club at Louis Pasteur Junior High School in Little Neck distributed flyers explaining to Queens residents that the marshlands must be protected and why. These flyers emphasized and detailed that 500 million pounds of the nation's food fish are sustained by the food resources of tidal marshes like those of Udalls Cove; 2) Kevin Wolfe, a 16-year-old, persuaded an unidentified adult to buy $900 worth of Great Neck Estates by the Great Neck Estates Marshland Preservation Committee. There were approximately 1,200 copies (40 pages of photographs and articles) that were distributed. Each of these articles and photographs detailed the significance of the marshes and plead that those remaining must not be destroyed. Mrs. Aurora Gareiss, president of Udalls Cove Preservation Committee, knowing full well the significance of both the marshlands and its inhabitants, declared: \\"We believe this precious remaining cove, with its upland and marshes, its fresh water streams and its fine springs and wild life, should be saved in its natural state for our present and future generations.\\" In his letter to Mrs. Gareiss, Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz stated that he was recommending to the Legislative Bills, in order to place all jurisdiction over wetlands in the State Departments of Environmental Conservation to prevent further dredging and filling by municipalities.Letter, Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz to President Gareiss, January 13, 1971, Memory Book Box 550, Folder 32, Coll. G-15, Aurora Gareiss Papers, 1929-1994 (Bulk 1964-1994), Long Island Division, Queens Borough Public Library. He also proposed bills which would forbid airports from extending into wetland areas, to require a State permit for dredging or placing fill in wetlands and to establish district environmental boards with authority to restrict construction or development with adverse environmental consequences. In his article, Robert Claiborne states how there have been a few small successes in the battle to block the wholesale destruction of the wetlands.Article, Claiborne, Robert, ‚ÄúBattle for the Swamps: Conservationists Fight To Save Vital Wetlands,‚Äù Time Life/ Nature/ Science Annual, 1971, Memory Book Box 550, Folder 32, Coll. G-15, Aurora Gareiss Papers, 1929-1994 (Bulk 1964-1994), Long Island Division, Queens Borough Public Library. One such success was how a Douglaston area citizens' group marched with hundreds of supporters in February 1971 to the marshes of Udalls Cove in Little Neck Bay. They succeeded in saving 100 acres of the cove from being converted into a golf course and parking lot. Back in 1972, Queens Borough President Manes asked the City Planning Commission to approve the creation of a 30-acre \\"wetland park\\" in the Douglaston-Little Neck area: this project included Udalls Cove.Article, Toscano, John, \\"Planners Expected to Approve a Wetland Park\\". NEWS Queens/ Daily News, September 21, 1972, Memory Book Box 550, Folder 32, Coll. G-15, Aurora Gareiss Papers, 1929-1994 (Bulk 1964-1994), Long Island Division, Queens Borough Public Library. During a public hearing, two speakers favored this proposal. The park was to consist of an irregular tract bounded by the Long Island Railroad tracks, Douglas Road (Bayshore Blvd.), Little Neck Parkway, and Little Neck Bay. President Manes explained how this park would serve as a natural park which excluded ball fields and playgrounds, and it would protect the last marshland in Queens outside of Jamaica Bay. Claire Shulman, Chairman of Community Planning Board II, told the planners that her board had already unanimously approved the park and urged for quick for quick adoption of the proposal. In August 1973, the Tri-State Regional Planning Commission published/issued a report stating that the ravine in Udalls Cove must be preserved \\"because of its ecological importance in maintaining the fresh water and nutrient inputs to Udalls Cove and Little Neck Bay: it serves as a watershed for the Douglaston-Little Neck area. Malcolm Wilson, in hopes of arousing support and conserving the environment, sent Aurora Gareiss a letter, on which the envelope cover was inscribed \\"Preserve the Environment.\\"Letter/Cover, Malcolm Wilson ‚ÄúLetter to Mrs. Aurora Gareiss ‚ÄòPreserve the Environment‚Äô‚Äù, Memory Book 1973-1978, Box 550, Folder 33, Coll.

In his letter to Aurora Gareiss, Martin Lang described man as greedy and ignorant, and how valiant voices like that of Mrs. Gareiss try to protect man from himself.Letter, Martin Lang, P.E. First Deputy Administrator, 15, Oct. 1975, Memory Book 1973-1978, Box 550, Folder 33, Coll.

He described how those in the city were developing a weapon for the purpose of managing our waters. Under Section 208 of Public Law 92-500, Lang and his colleagues were awarded an 8.1-million dollar grant from the Federal E.P.A. for the preparation of an area-wide waste management plan. According to an article in the Grass Roots Primer, the Udalls Cove Preservation Committee invited everyone from local communities to take a \\"Walk on the Marsh.\\"Article, The Grass Roots Primer, ‚ÄúThe Seemingly Miraculous Survival of the Udalls Cove Marsh,‚Äù December 1975, Memory Book 1973-1978, Box 550, Folder 33, Coll.

When asked what should be done about the marsh, the Indian replied, \\"Leave the marsh alone, and it will do for itself what it has done before all time.\\" In describing her paintings and role in saving the environment, Aurora Gareiss stated there are few people working for the environment.Article, O‚ÄôFlaherty, Mary, ‚ÄúPainter Asserts Ecology Brushes,‚Äù Queens-Long Island Sunday News, February 20, 1977, Memory Book, Box 550, Folder 34, Coll.

The word \\"Environment\\" became the key word to Mrs. Gareiss' changed attitudes about housework and paintings; it also became the focus of her civic activities. Gareiss claimed that 200-300 members of her community assisted her in preserving Udalls Cove. She wanted to become involved with other environmental matters in Queens and globally, believing that a healthy environment is a necessity, especially in a healthy economy and that Udalls Cove is a spawning ground of fish, birds and other animals. All these facts denote the significance of preserving Udalls Cove. Aurora Gareiss is also a member of the Northeast Queens Historical and Preservation Commission, which was set up in 1973 as a watchdog group to protect the wetlands and other natural resources of Queens North Shore. It is written in the article, Koch Signs Udalls Cove Order, which is part of the Queens Borough Library Collection in Jamaica, that Mayor Edward Koch signed an order designed to protect the Udalls Cove Wetlands.Article, Gianotti, Peter M., ‚ÄúKoch Signs Udalls Cove Order,‚Äù NEWSDAY, November 30, 1978, Memory Book Box 550, Folder 34, Coll.

This order authorized city acquisition of vacant land at the edge of the Cove for the possible use as a park and was signed before six city commissioners and more than 500 residents of northeastern Queens. Although the signing of this order seemed like no surprise, its setting was unusual. This was because the Board of Estimate, in September, had approved a resolution that would ease the purchase of the 4.5-acre site. According to environmental groups, the land is an essential component in the preservation of the Udalls Cove ravine, which is under the protection of the 1973 Tidal Wetlands Act. The environmentalists protested the possible leasing of this land by St. Anastasia's Roman Catholic Church to become a fast-food chain. Aurora Gareiss wrote a letter to friends and members of her committee informing them that the Udalls Cove Wildlife Sanctuary acquisitions were finally continuing again.Letter, Letter from Aurora Gareiss to Members and Friends, Udalls Cove Preservation Committee Inc., Spring 1982, Memory Book Box 550, Folder 35, Coll.

She also mentioned how the Committee members and the State Northeastern Queens Nature and Historical Preserve Commission were working with the State to ensure that all necessary properties to preserve the Cove in its present state of health were acquired. Gareiss and her colleagues wished to avoid alteration caused in filling or construction. This would have caused irreversible sedimentation and pollution to the Cove and Little Neck Bay. In his letter, Michael J. Del Giudice thanked Mrs. Gareiss for her March 4 letter further regarding the Udalls Cove acquisition project.Letter, Letter from Michael J.

Conceptions Internet-facilitated crimes against minors involve deceit and begin with adults communicating with children over the Internet with the goal of coercing them into illegal sexual activity. Sometimes the sexual abuse happens face to face. Chat rooms, instant messaging, Internet forums, social networking sites, cell phones, and even video game consoles have issues with online predations. These online areas attract predators because they allow them to have access to make contact with victims without drawing attention. In addition, there is insufficient reliable data concerning the number of minors sharing personal information online due to children's privacy issues. Also, the anonymity of online conversations leads to the disinhibition of minors, making them feel more comfortable and more likely to engage in risky behaviors. This allows predators to use manipulation to put their targets into situations where they will comply with the predator's sexual demands. Initial manipulation often involves introducing the minors to sexual activity, showing them pornography, and requesting sexually explicit information and pictures. This online predatory behavior does not often lead to offline contact. Even though it is the mainstream view that predators will use distinct tactics to meet victims, most actual in-person meetings do not involve any deception. In fact, the minors are usually complicit with perpetrators often using promises of love and romance to seduce victims to meet.Troup-Leasure K, Snyder HN. Statutory rape known to law enforcement. Juvenile Justice Bulletin; 2005 Aug. = Laws = In Australia, the murder of Carly Ryan in February 2007 led to public opinion pressure which eventually resulted in nationwide legal changes, nicknamed \\"Carly's Law\\", being made in 2017 to help protect minors online. Ryan, aged 15, was a victim of online grooming and predatory behaviour, which was considered unique at the time, given that Ryan was the first person in Australia (and possibly the world) killed by an online pedophile. In the U.S., some risks involving online predatory behavior are addressed by the Children's Internet Protection Act, which was passed in 2000. This law required schools and libraries to install filtering and blocking software, to keep students away from obscene and harmful materials and individuals online. A bill called HR 5319 or the \\"Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006\\" (DOPA) was later introduced, intensifying the provisions of CIPA. If enacted, it will require schools and libraries that receive E-rate funding to protect minors from online predators by restricting access to social media websites and chatrooms. Some individuals have also initiated actions against laws designed to protect children. Doe v. Shurtleff, 628 F.3d 1217 (10th Cir. 2010), was a United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit case assessing the constitutionality of Utah Code Ann. ¬ß 77-27-21.5, a law that requires sex offenders to register their internet identifiers with the state in order to \\"assist in investigating kidnapping and sex-related crimes, and in apprehending offenders\\". In this case, a convicted sex offender, appearing anonymously as John Doe, appealed a decision by the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah to vacate an order enjoining the enforcement of Utah Code Ann. ¬ß 77-27-21.5. Criticism Cases involving stalking, violence, abduction, rape and/or murder are very rare. Most online sex offenders are young adults who target teens and seduce victims into sexual relationships. They take time to develop the trust and confidence of teens, so the teens see these relationships as romances or sexual adventures. Nearly 75 percent of victims who met offenders face-to-face did so more than once. Most of these offenders are charged with crimes such as statutory rape for non-forcible sexual contact as the victims are, by law, too young to consent. The youth most vulnerable to online sex offenders have histories of sexual or physical abuse, family problems, and tendencies to take risks both on- and offline. A 2007 study found no cases of minors being targeted by internet predators on the basis of information they had posted on social networking sites.

Kass. At Mars One's VIP event in Amsterdam, 3-June-2016, Dr. Kass talked about his extensive professional experience in human spaceflight. James R. Kass is a Canadian physicist engaged in the field of human spaceflight. Biography Kass holds a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in physics and mathematics (Montreal) and a Master of Science (MS) in physics (Ann Arbor, Michigan), and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in physics in Leeds, England. After he completed his PhD Dr Kass joined the Max-Planck Institute to research in Nuclear Physics. Starting a career of more than 30 years in human spaceflight, he worked as a scientist at the department of medicine at Joh.-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany, where he researched in Neurophysiology and space medicine, particularly in the area of sensory perception. This work was carried out in conjunction with two Spacelab missions, Spacelab-1 and Spacelab-D1. Kass started his circuitous route to human spaceflight at the height of the Space Age in 1962, when he registered at Sir George Williams University in Montreal attempting to commence studies in this domain. In the absence of a university program on space flight, he studied physics and mathematics, and proceeded to become a research fellow in nuclear physics. But, as fate would have it, he finally fulfilled his dream, when some 20 years later he sat at the Johnson Spaceflight Centre (JSC) in Houston and directed the astronaut crew Ulf Merbold, Byron Lichtenberg, Robert Parker, and Skylab veteran Owen Garriott, to perform experiments in the domain of vestibular physiology prepared by a team of European investigators, of which he was one. Following this he worked for the aerospace industry in Bremen and Munich in the sectors of space operations, tele-medical research, artificial intelligence, and human behaviour, performing work in neutral buoyancy, in parabolic flight, with the Mir station and with long-duration isolation missions. He was recruited to work for the European Space Agency (ESA) at their establishment in The Netherlands, ESTEC as senior scientist in 2000 where he worked on the STS-107 Spacehab/Space Shuttle mission. He has worked in the psychology of long-duration spaceflight, lecturing at University College London (UCL) (England) and Concordia University (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). He has worked in the fields of telemedicine and eHealth, being a member of the Telemedicine Alliance project, where he contributed to Data Privacy, and eSurveillance. He is an adviser on the Mars One project, on which he was co-editor of a book on this subject. He currently runs a space consultancy, and has advised the European Commission in the domain of knowledge mgmt, carried out training in the domain of sharing knowledge and lessons learned, and arranges collaborative efforts between the European Space Agency Business Applications program and industry.

These marine hydroids live in the shelly tubes of serpulid tube worms, which are annelids. The genus Protulophila was named by Rovereto in 1901, from fossil material. For many years scientists knew these animals only from fossils, and the genus was thought to have become extinct about four million years ago. However, in 2014, animals of this genus were discovered within National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) museum material that had been live-collected in New Zealand in 2008. Protulophila can be regarded as a living fossil. History Fossil remains of Protulophila were previously known only from marine deposits in Europe and the Middle East, deposits that date from about 150 million years ago to 4 million years ago, when the genus was thought to have become extinct. In 2014, fossils of the genus that were less than one million-years-old were found in Whanganui, New Zealand by NIWA scientists. The scientist then wondered if perhaps the genus might still be extant in New Zealand. A search of NIWA's invertebrate collection during 2014 revealed specimens of Protulophila in preserved material of serpulid tube worms which had been live-collected in 2008, in 20 m of water in Queen Charlotte Sound, near Picton, New Zealand. The scientists, led by marine biologist Dr. Dennis Gordon, are planning to collect some fresh material so that gene sequencing can be carried out. The other life stage Colonial Hydrozoa usually have two very different life stages. All the material that has so far been found of Protulophila is the hydroid or polypoid stage of the organism, a stage in which individual polyps are connected together in a colony. It is likely that there is also a medusoid (small pelagic jellyfish-like) stage, but the medusoid stage in this genus is currently either unknown, or may possibly have been named but has not yet been recognized as being the same organism as the hydroid stage. As Dr. Gordon commented: \\"Many hydroid species have a two-stage life cycle and often the two stages have never been matched. Our discovery may thus mean that we are solving two puzzles at once.‚Äù Species Named species within the genus Protulophila include: * Protulophila gestroi Rovereto, from the Pliocene of Italy Further reading \\"Hydroid-Serpulid symbiosis in the Mesozoic and Tertiary\\" by Colin T.

History The 42-line field gun M1877 was designed by Krupp. Some of the guns were manufactured in Germany while most of them were manufactured in the Obuhov factory in Russia.Finnish Army Artillery Use of the guns were limited by lack of equipment needed for indirect fire - the Russian gun-sight used with them was suitable only to direct fire. Therefore, the gun saw use as fortress and coastal artillery for coastal defence which allowed the guns to shoot direct fire for defending harbours and beaches. In 1918 the Finnish Army could capture some 102 42-line field guns and put them into service. Last shots being fired with the field gun were during the Winter War in March 1940. The 42-line field gun M1877 could fire high explosive (HE) or shrapnel shells of 12.5 kg (27.6 lbs) weight at a distance of 5.3 km (3.3 miles).JAEGER PLATOON: FINNISH ARMY 1918 - 1945 WEBSITE.

On its domed summit is a monolith of the same name (which means \\"Devil's Rock\\"). Traces of human activity on the rock indicate that it acted as a cult object in former times.  Geography  The hill, which is a southeastern spur of the 487-metre-high Peterskopf massif, lies north of where the River Isenach breaks out of the Palatinate Forest mountains into the hill country of the Weinstra√üe and Upper Rhine Plain. From its summit, which nowadays is wooded, there is an all-round view over the Rhine Plain to the east, the Palatinate Forest to the west, and its eastern mountain range, the Haardt, which runs from north to south. Until 1981, when the it was closed for legal reasons, a gondola lift ran from the site of the D√ºrkheimer Wurstmarkt, the Br√ºhlwiesen, in a northwesterly direction up to the top of the Teufelsstein. A southern outlier, which is also part of the Peterskopf massif, is the 300-metre-high K√§stenberg (Pal. for Kastanienberg or \\"chestnut hill\\"), is host to the remains of the Heidenmauer, a large Celtic settlement with a 2.5 km long circular wall, which was built around 500 B. C., as well as the Roman quarry, the Kriemhildenstuhl, which was used until the 4th century A. D.  Name  The Teufelsstein, which gave the hill its name, is a rock formation about 2.50 metres high and up to 4 metres wide. Five steps have been carved into the rock, staircase-fashion, leading to the top where there is a hollow which is thought to be a sacrifice bowl (Opferschale) for religious rites of its former, probably Celtic users and from which a blood channel (Blutrinne) runs down the rock by the steps. In addition the rock has numerous symbols carved into it, dating to various periods. As well as sun wheels, runes and Roman letters there are several markings that recall the stonemason's marks of the 12th and 13th centuries. According to older accounts, two coarsely drawn human figures as well as other carvings used to be visible as well, but they have since weathered away or been deliberately destroyed. In the near vicinity of the Teufelsstein are several large rocks which could be the remains of a former enclosure of the summit plateau.  Legend of the Teufelsstein  The following local legend is told about the Teufelsstein: :Once upon a time, when Limburg Abbey was built on a hill opposite the Teufelsstein, the monks deceived the Devil into helping with its construction. They led him to believe they wanted to build an inn and in this way induced him into stacking the giant stone ashlars on top of one another. It was not until the after the building had been finished and the bells rang out for the solemn consecration of the basilica, that the Devil realised the deception. Full of wrath he wanted to take the huge boulder froom the hill opposite and hurl it at the new monastery. But God protected the monks, the stone turned out to be as soft as butter. Then the Devil sat on it and left imprints of his bottom, his feet and his tail that are still visible today... In his book Die malerische und romantische Rheinpfalz (\\"The Picturesque and Romantic Rhenish Palatinate\\") Franz Wei√ü wrote an epic poem about the legend of the Teufelsstein that ends as follows: :Noch ruhet auf derselben Stelle ein stummer Zeuge und allein, wo er entfiel dem Herrn der H√∂lle, auf hohem Berg ‚Äì der Teufelsstein. :\\"Still it rests on that same spot, a silent witness and alone, where it escaped the Lord of Hell, on a mountain high - the Devil's Stone.\\"  References  Archaeological sites in Germany Mountains and hills of Rhineland-Palatinate Rock formations of Rhineland-Palatinate Culture of the Palatinate (region) Mountains and hills of the Palatinate Forest Bad D√ºrkheim (district) Natural monuments in Rhineland-Palatinate ","title":"Teufelsstein (Haardt)"},{"id":"42901555","title":"2009 Donegal County Council election"},{"id":"42901563","text":"The Govind Ramnath Kare College of Law, more popularly known as the G.R.

Having worked a few years in trade, he moved to Riga in 1865 and became curator of the entomological department of the Riga Museum, and then at the Riga Technical University. In 1873, he was invited by Hermann Burmeister (1807‚Äì1892), director of the Museum of Buenos Aires, to join him in Argentina. As early as 1874, Berg began an expedition to Patagonia to collect specimens for the museum. This first collecting trip was followed by others through Argentina, also in Chile and Uruguay. Apart from a period of two years from 1890 to 1892, spent at the Museo Nacional in Montevideo, he was based in Buenos Aires. He replaced Burmeister as the head of the museum in 1892. His first specialty was entomology, but he was also dedicated to paleontology and the study of vertebrates. Amongst his many other achievements, he described Cactoblastis cactorum, the cactus moth. Berg was a fellow of the Entomological Society of London and a corresponding member of the Zoological Society of London. Works partial list *1875 Lepid√≥pteros patag√≥nicos.

A member of Venstre, Denmark's Liberal Party, he has been mayor of Esbjerg since 1994. Career as Esbjerg's mayor In 1994, against all expectations, S√∏trup was elected mayor of Esbjerg in the southwest of Jutland, Denmank, toppling the well established Social Democrats and heading 16 members of the Venstre party on the city council. In July 1999, S√∏trup hit the headlines as he returned from Athens with an Olymypic torch as Esbjerg hosted the summer edition of the European Youth Olympic Days. In November 1999, he oversaw the transfer of Esbjerg Harbour to Esbjerg Municipality. Under S√∏trup's mayoralty, in 2003 work began on the extension of the Esbjerg Sports Park ( Esbjerg Idr√¶tspark), including the construction of a stadium stand seating 3,500. In 2004, S√∏trup expressed satisfaction at the city council's approval of Esbjerg's gigantic Dokken project with a conference centre and a 125-meter tower which would be Denmark's tallest building. He was also delighted to hear in May 2006, as a result of its strong support for talented young people, Esbjerg had been selected by Jyllands-Posten as Danish City of the Year. The city had also received the award in 1997. S√∏trup's city council decided to further improve Esbjerg's sports facilities in 2008 with the allocation of DKK 105 million for a new football stadium accommodating 18,000. S√∏trup qualified the design as Denmark's finest. In 2009, S√∏trup embarked on his fifth term as mayor, consolidating his position and his success in bringing culture and jobs to the city of Esbjerg. He suffered a heart attack in August 2011 and was hospitalized in Odense. He was soon back at work, encouraging the establishment of off-shore and wind-turbine firms in the area with the promise of new jobs. By contrast, he experienced one of his most difficult days in May 2012 when Danish Crown announced the closure of its Esbjerg meat-packaging plant affecting 500 employees. The municipal elections in November 2013 brought S√∏trup further success when he received 10,677 personal votes, some 8,000 more than John Snedker, his Social Democrat rival.

The band consisted of Ollie Weikert (lead vocals, bass), Bradley Hutchings (guitar, backing vocals), Andy Burgess (drums, percussion). No Atlas (originally called Metropolis) released their debut EP Where People Have Been in 2013 and their popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their single, ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Wanna‚Äù (2013). No Atlas‚Äô second EP, Reply and Reply (2014), propelled them to greater national exposure with consistent radio airplay from BBC Introducing, BBC 6 Music and Tone Radio. They are of the few indie rock bands to hail from the Cheltenham music scene at the dawn of the 2013 and almost singularly helped create the progressive-indie movement. In July 2015 it was announced they would be splitting but it is rumored they may reunite and begin touring again. History Weikert, Hutchings and Burgess met as students on the Popular Music course at the University of Gloucestershire, and began playing under the name Metropolis. They first played live at Mosaic House, Prague, (Czech Republic), with stand-in bass player Toby Smallwood. After releasing their debut EP Where People Have Been the band continued to progress with radio airplay, national television interviews, and live sessions for the BBC and with new bass player (Thomas Muddle) the band began to play shows. Initially they played gigs at small Cheltenham venues such as The Frog and Fiddle, 2 Pigs and St Pauls Tavern but then later moved to playing venues in London and Bristol such as The Croft and Tooting Tram and Social. In late 2013, No Atlas supported Jim Lockey & The Solemn Sun on their sold-out homecoming show in Cheltenham. In early 2014, the band signed to El Foreigners Music, and released their second EP Reply and Reply which was received with positive critical acclaim by online music blogs such as Scatter Magazine and Don't Need No Melody. The band played an up-and-coming showcase for Two Thousand Trees Festival at the Frog and Fiddle, after which Muddle left the band to pursue other musical ventures, fronting short-lived post-grunge outfit Bloody Gums. The band went on to successfully play shows as a three piece with Weikert as the bass player. In July 2015, No Atlas announced via bandcamp they were splitting as a band, releasing demos from a planned future album, stating \\"Half of what was to be a possible future album, we unanimously decided to release the following songs and demos to say a massive thank you to what No Atlas was always about - the people who supported us\\". It has been rumoured that No Atlas will be reuniting and playing shows at Butlins. Currently Burgess is doing session work, Weikert is writing music, Muddle is fronting D-I-Cry indie punk three-piece Homer Junior and Hutchings' whereabouts is unknown.

While serving in the 90th Infantry (fighting quite often), the regiment saw combat at Holly Springs, Coldwater, the Siege of Vicksburg, the Siege of Jackson, and Missionary Ridge The regiment was marching through Florence, Alabama in the late summer of 1863. While on the march Hook entered a seemingly empty house to search for supplies; while she was searching, two Confederate soldiers hiding in the house surprised and captured her. Hook was imprisoned, as a man, in Atlanta, Georgia. Soon after her imprisonment she attempted an escape, but was shot in the thigh and taken to the prison hospital. While being treated another doctor discovered her true sex. Hook was moved to a separate room and put on a list of prisoners to be exchanged. On February 17, 1864, Hook was one of twenty-seven Union prisoners exchanged at Graysville, Georgia. During her imprisonment she told her story to Confederate doctors and officers. The Confederacy was so impressed by her actions she received a letter from Confederate President Jefferson Davis offering her a commission if she would fight for the Confederate army. Hook refused stating she would rather serve in the Union Army as a private than in the Confederate army as a lieutenant. She went on to state she would rather be hanged than fight against the Union. When Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, a Union Army surgeon, heard this report she argued Hook should be made a lieutenant in the Union Army, but was ignored. Because Dr. Walker was thrilled about the news of a female soldier, she notified the press. Hook consented to interviews, but refused to give her real name. She promised newspaper reporters that she would go home, though many doubted her.Blanton, DeAnne, and Lauren M. Cook. They Fought Like Demons: Women Soldiers in the American Civil War. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2002. pgs. 96-97. Frances Hook was again discharged and told to go home. The officers who were in charge of sending her home alerted recruitment authorities, \\"advising them to be on the lookout for her trying to rejoin the service.\\" With no home to go to some speculate she enlisted again; however, there is no substantial proof she did. Later life Hook eventually married, and had a daughter named Maggie. After her mother's death, on March 17, 1908 Maggie Dickson wrote to the War Department seeking confirmation of Frances Hook's military service. The letter was forwarded to the Adjutant General's Office, who was able to locate a record of Hook's medical treatment in which she claimed to be a soldier in the 90th Illinois, though there was no record in the files of the War Department to corroborate her service claims.Blanton, DeAnne, and Lauren M.

It was developed in the United Kingdom. Plot According to the instruction manual, the game takes place on Earth in the future where inhabitants are dependent on silicon for technology. Unfortunately, the silicon reserves are running out, but another source of silicon has been located in a faraway part of the galaxy. A mercenary going by the name of Sillo is sent to the dangerous area with a vehicle called the \\"silicon fisher\\" to gather the silicon and transport the cargo back to Earth. Gameplay The game consists of a maze located above a stream that flows from the top to the bottom of the screen. The player navigates through the maze with the silicon fisher vehicle while looking for silicon that floats along the river. Collecting the silicon is done by positioning the vehicle towards the direction where the silicon is heading and throwing out a net to catch it. Every so often, an enemy called a \\"Kryllon\\" materializes in the air and explodes after a short time span. If the player is within range of the explosion, they will be killed. As each level is completed, the speed of the game quickens along with more randomly appearing Kryllons.

It was originally described in the genus Aphaenogaster (Mayr, 1853), even though Forel remarked on its 3-segmented antennal club, rather than 4 as is usual in that genus. This character, coupled with the presence of angulate humeri and a queen with a depressed mesosoma, caused Emery (1915) to exclude M. belti from Aphaenogaster and transfer it to Atopula (Emery, 1912). Forel (1917) decided that Atopula was artificial, \\"composed of disparate species,\\" and established the genus Brunella to include only M. belti. The component species of Atopula were later dispersed to other genera by Bolton (1976), who retained genus Brunella as its \\"affinities are unclear.\\" Later however, Bolton (1982) synonymised Brunella under Aphaenogaster, thus returning M. belti to its original generic combination. More extensive recent sampling of the Madagascan ant fauna has made it clear that this synonymy was incorrect. The discovery of several species referable to Forel's Brunella has allowed the diagnosis of a distinct group of Madagascan endemics, which are convergent in some characters with Aphaenogaster but certainly not congeneric with it. The final act of this history has been the realisation that Brunella (Forel, 1917) is the junior homonym of a crustacean genus Brunella (G.W. Smith, 1909), from Tasmania. No replacement name was essential for Brunella (Forel, 1917) while it was a junior synonym, but after it was revived from synonymy a replacement name was necessary: Malagidris. Identification The larger, more gracile species (e.g. M. alperti, M. galokoa, M. jugum, M. sofina) of Malagidris are remarkably convergent on the widely distributed genus Aphaenogaster. However, all species of Malagidris have two critical features never exhibited by Aphaenogaster species. First, the midpoint of the anterior clypeal margin of Malagidris has a single, stout, unpaired seta. In Aphaenogaster there is always a conspicuous pair of setae, one on each side of the midpoint of the anterior clypeal margin. Second, Aphaenogaster species do not have the characteristic structure of the anteroventral peduncle of the petiole. In addition to these, Malagidris always has the following: a transverse crest present on the stipes of the maxilla; a 3-segmented antennal club; a subpetiolar process present; a strongly developed sting; the anterior clypeal margin convex at the midpoint. In Aphaenogaster, by contrast, the stipes usually lacks a crest (a crest is incompletely and weaky developed in a few species, strong only in A. relicta, from Haiti, which may not be properly referable to Aphaenogaster), usually has a 4-segmented antennal club (5-segmented to gradually incrassate in some species but never 3-segmented), lacks a subpetiolar process, has a very weakly developed or vestigial sting, and usually (but not always) has the midpoint of the anterior clypeal margin concave or indented.

Heterick (2006), in his revision of the Malagasy species of Monomorium, recognised the peculiarity of the high palp formula and utilised it, together with some other characters, to define his M. shuckardi group, all members of which are now transferred to Royidris.

Known from Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela, the species was originally described as Monomorium inusuale in 2007, but was reclassified as the type species for the new genus Kempfidris in 2014. The species is only known from workers and almost nothing is known about their natural history. Description The genus was described in 2014 based on the workers of a single species, K. inusualis, originally described by Fern√°ndez (2007) and provisionally placed in Monomorium awaiting a better understanding of the internal relationships in Myrmicinae. Kempfidris has a series of distinctive morphological characters including the mandibular configuration, vestibulate propodeal spiracle, propodeal carinae, and cylindrical micro-pegs on the posteromedian portion of abdominal tergum VI and anteromedian portion of abdominal tergum VII. This last trait appears to be autapomorphic for the genus. Queens and males are unknown. The most outstanding feature of Kempfidris is the series of minute, hair-bearing tubercles or cylindrical pegs on the abdominal apex. Most are concentrated on the anteromedian portion of the pygidium and some on the posteromedian portion of abdominal tergite VI, a position that would coincide with the position of the pygidial gland, which opens between abdominal tergites VI and VII. The structure of the micropegs with their associated hairs also hints at some sort of glandular function, or possibly a mechano-reception function during stinging, but a more convincing explanation will only be possible after a histological study. Whatever the function of these tubercles, they appear to be an autapomorphic structure, absent in other Myrmicinae and probably in other ants as well. In ants, the most structurally similar cuticular projections can be found throughout most of the body of some species in the formicine genus Echinopla, except on the pygidium, and additionally on the gastral apex of an undescribed species of Strumigenys. Given that these aforementioned taxa are not closely related to Kempfidris, their structures are probably not homologous, but perhaps convergent evolution could be considered, especially in the case of the dacetine ant. Other specialized pygidial structures found in ants are the denticles or spines of Cerapachyinae (now Dorylinae) and the large, upward-curving teeth in Pachycondyla crassinoda workers, but their position and form are very different. Most members of the solenopsidine group are smooth, with little sculpturing, but this species presents a moderate amount of sculpturing on the head, mesosoma, petiole and postpetiole. Distribution Kempfidris is known from Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela. Despite the fact that this species is broadly distributed in South America, records of its occurrence are extremely scarce. Until recently, Kempfidris inusualis was known only from the type series examined by Fern√°ndez (2007) and a nest series collected in 2006. Despite its broad distribution, specimens of K. inusualis are relatively uniform in size and general aspect. The main differences regarding geographic variation involve slightly distinct propodeal shapes, such as a shorter dorsal face in the Ecuadorian specimens. Specimens from Rond√¥nia, Brazil, differ from other conspecific workers by their darker color (almost black) and more prominent propodeal crests that form small denticles. Given the similarity among the samples examined, Fern√°ndez, Feitosa & Lattke (2014) decided to consider these morphological differences as intraspecific variation. Biology Almost nothing is known about the natural history of K. inusualis. Most of the specimens studied were apparently obtained from leaf-litter samples. The nest series collected in the Venezuelan Amazon was obtained from a rotten stick, also harboring a termite nest, on the ground next to an airstrip. The habitat there is open scrub to low trees on white sandy soil that is seasonally flooded by dark, colored waters. All the known samples were collected between July and September, suggesting a more intense activity in this period, which coincides with the low level of the rivers in the Amazon Basin. All things considered, this could also be a collecting artifact, as the aforementioned period approximately coincides with academic holidays in many universities and represents a lower probability of conflict between lectures and field trips.

It nests on oceanic islands and atolls, on cliff ledges, ridges or rocky slopes. On some islands, nesting birds are threatened by feral cats and rats. Due to ongoing habitat loss and small breeding range, this species is evaluated as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In May 2007, a herald petrel tagged on Raine Island in 1984 was observed off the coast of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. This greatly increases the known life span and range of the species. Also it was recently identified as this species, from what was previously an unidentified Pterodroma species, to be breeding on Round Island, 22 kilometers north of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean. In August 2017, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services (QPWS) staff confirmed a herald petrel chick had hatched on Raine Island after sighting an adult herald petrel taking care of a single egg in a nest in June 2017.

Prose, the dominant part is narrated by an ashik and is interspersed with poems sung by the same artist to the accompaniment of saz. Hikaye is an Arabic word that means \\"tale\\". In modern Turkish this word refers to the tales of ashiks and can be translated as \\"folk romance\\". The hik√¢ye revolves around the amorous exploits of an ashik. The ashik's separation from his love interest throughout the main narrative does not result from his beloved's coy or cruel volition but rather from external circumstances such as meddlesome parents and rivals. Hikayeh is akin to the, more general, genre known in the Central Asia as Dastan. Indeed, in Azerbaijani language the word \\"dastan\\" is literally equivalent to hikaye, and its Turkish cognate \\"destan\\" is also used to refer to this genre. Morphology of hikaye Amelia Gallagher, based on the works of ƒ∞lhan Ba≈üg√∂z summarizes the morphology of hikaye as the following: The hikaye commences with the ashik's birth and concludes with his marriage. To establish the ashik's initial situation, his family is described in a given time and place. Subsequently, a crisis manifests, typically the lack of a child, which is resolved when the child is born. The ashik faces a pivotal crisis in the narrative during adolescence. When he falls in love the ashik accesses a divine gift‚Äîthe ability to express his love in poetic song.Ba·π£g√∂z, I. (1967). Dream Motif in Turkish Folk Stories and Shamanistic Initiation. Asian Folklore Studies, 26(1), 1-18. In the context of performance, the saz accompanies the ashik throughout. The central crisis in the narrative arises from the ashik's separation from his beloved. A series of obstacles and adventures comprise the remainder of the hik√¢ye, as the ashik endeavors to re-unite with his beloved. During times of trial and exuberance, the ashik turns to poetic song to express his elation, desperation, and distress.  Famous hikayes As the art of ashik is based on oral tradition, the number of hikayes can be as many as the ashiks themselves. ƒ∞lhan Ba≈üg√∂z, reporting on the hikaye telling in the coffeehouses in Azerbaijan cities, had observed that ashika generally alter a given hikaye depending on the circumstances.Basgoz, I. (1970). Turkish Hikaye-Telling Tradition in Azerbaijan, Iran. Journal of American Folklore, 83(330), 394. Therefore, hikayes have evolved over time and a refined version of the most famous ones have survived to our times. ƒ∞lhan Ba≈üg√∂z lists 26 hikayes which were popular in Tabriz in late 1960s. In the following we present a brief list of the most famous hikayes: * Shah Ismail * The Epic of K√∂roƒülu * Ashiq Q…ôrib * A≈üƒ±q Valeh See alsoDastan References Azerbaijani music Turkish music Arabic words and phrases Central Asian music Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity Turkish poetry ","title":"Turkish hikaye"},{"id":"42901895","title":"2004 Donegal County Council election"},{"id":"42901900","text":"The Land Drainage Act 1961 was an Act of Parliament passed by the United Kingdom Government which provided mechanisms for river boards to raise additional finance to fund their obligations. It built upon the provisions of the Land Drainage Act 1930 and the River Boards Act 1948. Background Prior to the 1930s, land drainage in the United Kingdom was regulated by the Statute of Sewers, passed by King Henry VIII in 1531, and several further acts which built upon that foundation. However, there was some dissatisfaction with these powers, as the administrative bodies responsible for the drainage of low-lying areas had insufficient resources to do this effectively. A royal commission was convened to review the situation, and produced a final report on 5 December 1927. This formed the basis for a bill which became the Land Drainage Act 1930 on 1 August 1930. It created catchment boards, with overall authority for some of the main rivers of England and Wales, and internal drainage boards which would manage the drainage of smaller areas. For the first time since the passing of the Statute of Sewers by King Henry VIII in 1531, the funding of drainage activities was not restricted solely to those whose land or property would be flooded without the work of the authority. Catchment boards could levy rates on the county councils and county borough councils throughout their entire catchment, not just on the low-lying parts of it, and could also levy rates on the internal drainage boards within their area. The royal commission had identified one hundred catchment areas, based on the main rivers of England and Wales. When the Act was published, it contained only 47 catchment areas. This was altered by the passing of the River Boards Act 1948, which defined thirty-two river board areas, covering almost the whole of England and Wales, and created a river board for each one. The Boards inherited the land drainage, fisheries and river pollution functions of the catchment boards. The Act The Land Drainage Act 1961 addressed a number of issues that arose from the change from catchment boards to river boards, particularly in the area of finance. It became an Act of Parliament on 27 July 1961, with the full title \\"An Act to enable river boards and catchment boards to raise drainage charges for the purpose of meeting part of their expenses; and to make further provision relating to the drainage of land and to drainage boards.\\" It consisted of 54 section, organised into four parts, and two schedules, the first containing minor amendments to the Land Drainage Act 1930 and the River Boards Act 1948, with the second listing parts of previous legislation which had been repealed. Part 1 covered drainage charges. Under the 1930 Act, internal drainage boards could raise finance by a levy on the owners of agricultural land and buildings within their area, and the catchment board could levy the internal drainage board. Section 1 allowed the river board to raise a similar levy or general drainage charge payable by owners of agricultural land and buildings which were within the river board area, but were not within an area managed by an internal drainage board. The provision also applied to the Conservators of the River Thames and the River Lee Catchment Board, as both organisations continued to operate under the provisions of the 1930 Act, rather than the 1948 Act. Part 2 covered miscellaneous provisions. It allowed a river board to charge a local authority for the services it provided, where those services had been transferred from the local authority as a result of the 1948 Act. The Act simplified the situation where drainage works were required. River boards could effectively act as an internal drainage board, and assume to powers which applied to one. Before the legislation, this could only be achieved by creating a new internal drainage district with its own board, and then petitioning the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries to transfer its functions to the river board. It also allowed the minister, upon receipt of a petition, to create a new internal drainage board and give it the powers of the river board, where they had previously acted in this capacity. Section 19 widened the scope of river boards, which had been restricted to work in connection with main rivers. They were now allowed to carry out work which would improve defences against flooding by seawater or tidal water anywhere within their areas. There was also provision for the drainage of small areas by a river board, county council or county borough council where the creation of an internal drainage board was impracticable, while section 41 allowed river boards to insure their members against accidents, which they had previously not been able to do. Part 3 covered the restoration and improvement of ditches. It allowed anyone who owned land which could not be properly drained because of the condition of a ditch which was not part of that land to apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal for an order to improve the ditch. Such an order would name the person responsible for carrying out the work, which might be another landowner, or a drainage board. Finally, part 4 contained some supplementary provisions. In particular, it clarified the position of the Conservators of the River Thames and the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board, which had continued to act as catchment boards under the terms of the 1930 Act. The land drainage functions specified by that Act had been removed from river boards by the 1948 Act, and section 51 ensured that the powers of the 1961 Act also applied to the two catchment boards. Subsequent development The provisions of this Act were short-lived, since river boards, which were its primary focus, were swept away by the Water Resources Act 1963, which replaced the thirty-two river boards with twenty-seven river authorities. The anomaly of the Conservators of the River Thames and the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board was resolved by effectively making them into river authorities. Although it became law on 31 July 1963, the change from boards to authorities did not actually occur until 1 April 1965.

It is also a parish church of the Diocese of Orlando. History Interior of the Basilica. The first Catholics that moved to Daytona Beach arrived in 1881. Mass was celebrated in private homes a couple of times a year by priests who traveled from DeLand. Daytona Beach became a mission of St. Teresa Church in Titusville in 1886. Mass was now celebrated every Sunday in either the opera house or the armory. The Rev. John F. O‚ÄôBoyle became the first resident priest in Daytona Beach in 1895. He purchased property on South Palmetto and Myrtle Avenues and built a church in 1898. The Rev. William J. Mullally arrived in 1923 and made plans to build a school and a new church. The school, which opened in 1925, was the only Catholic school on Florida‚Äôs East Coast between St. Augustine and West Palm Beach at that time. He built the present church, which was completed in 1927. Construction costs totaled around $250,000. The cupola (dome) and cross on top of the building date from 2006. They replace the ones damaged in the hurricanes of 2004. Pope Benedict XVI decreed on January 20, 2006 that St. Paul's church was elevated to the status of a minor basilica. It was solemnized by Bishop Thomas G. Wenski on the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul that same year. Architecture The Mission Revival structure was designed by Chicago architect Gerald A. Barry. When it was built it was the tallest building on the mainland, and it was one of the first buildings in the area to be built with central heat and air-conditioning. Above the altar is a fresco of the conversion of St. Paul.

They are believed to make breathing easier and for that reason are used during athletic exertion and as an aid to reduce congestion or to prevent snoring. Various studies have not indicated that they have a performance- enhancing effect. They are also used by race horse trainers on horses for similar reasons; they are thought to reduce airway resistance and lower the risk of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH), plus reduce fatigue and aid post-race recovery. Human use A gridiron football player wearing a nasal strip In humans, the nasal valve is the narrowest part of the nasal aperture and when exercising, this area is subjected to negative pressure and becomes smaller. Nasal strips adhere to the skin, holding open the anterior nasal aperture and prevent it from collapsing. When properly applied, they lift and widen the space in the nasal passage. They are a drug-free method to maintain airway flow and are available as an over the counter product. They have no reported side effects other than possible skin irritation from the adhesive. Studies indicate that they are useful in increasing nasal cavity volume in the front three centimeters of the human nose, and for that purpose could be an alternative to decongestive nose sprays, but nasal strips are not particularly helpful for congestion in the posterior nasal apertures. They also have been shown to reduce snoring loudness and improve quality of sleep. Subjects wearing the strips in tests indicated that they believed that the strips helped them breathe more easily, and they are of particular interest to those human athletes who have to wear a mouthguard and need to be able to breathe more through their nostrils than their mouths. Studies have not necessarily demonstrated that athletic performance is increased, but people wearing them seem to have far less dyspnea or shortness of breath while exercising. Equine use Equine nasal strip worn by California Chrome In horses, they are viewed as helpful because the animals cannot breathe through their mouths, only through their nostrils. As with humans, the equine design helps keep the nasal valve from collapsing due to the negative pressure created by physical exertion. However, their primary benefit is to prevent bleeding in the lungs (EIPH), not to directly enhance performance. The equine version was invented by two veterinarians, James Chiapetta and Edward Blach. In the 1990s, they were inspired by the human product to attempt to create a similar device for horses. They had observed horses on treadmills and saw that, under exertion, the equine nasal passage also narrowed due to the tissue being sucked in. They worked out a licensing agreement with CNS, the company that manufactured the human \\"Breathe Right\\" brand of nasal strips in 1997 (now owned by GlaxoSmithKline) where the company manufactured the equine form of the nasal strip, and paid royalties to Chiapetta and Blach. The equine version was first used publicly at the 1999 Breeders' Cup horse races and the 2000 Summer Olympics. In 2001, they parted ways with CNS and formed their own company, Flair, and in 2008, Chiapetta acquired Blach.

It is a member of the SeriousFun Children's Network, a worldwide association of camps for seriously ill children.The charity was co-founded by Joe Woods and Paul Newman in 1999 as The Over The Wall Gang Camp in the style of the American Hole in the Wall Gang Camp set up by Paul Newman. __TOC__ Camp Programme The camp currently provides around 10 camps a year for children and families affected by serious illness. All of the camps are provided completely free of charge.https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/07/nhs- health-officials-frontline-care There are currently three different types of camp offered throughout the year: * Seriously ill children ages 8‚Äì17 years (5 nights) * Siblings of seriously ill children aged 8‚Äì17 years (4 nights) * Family groups, with a child with a serious illness (2 nights) In 2013, the charity held summer camps in England and Scotland for 444 children between the ages of 8 and 17, with over 130 different medical conditions, including blood disorders, cancers and tumours, cerebral palsy, genetic disorders, epilepsy, heart conditions and many more, including extremely rare illnesses. The camps for siblings of children with serious illness are typically organised in the Easter Holidays, and shorter family camps are organised throughout the year. Whilst at camp the children are able to try a wide variety of activities often including; wall climbing, abseiling, fishing, canoeing, horse riding, archery, swimming, arts and crafts, music, drama, sports, talent night and a disco. Unlike other camps in the SeriousFun Children's Network, Over The Wall has no permanent site and holds camps in multiple locations in the UK, including at Bryanston School, Tulliallan Castle, and Strathallan School, allowing it to serve families from across the UK.  Aims of the Camps  While hospitals and healthcare staff aim to take care of the physical aspects of serious illness in a child, living with a serious illness can impact children in a number of ways. The diagnosis of a serious illness at an early age, and the subsequent lengthy process of treatment and hospital visits are likely to result in a lack of confidence and self-esteem in most children. Over The Wall aims to rebuild their confidence and esteem through a programme of Therapeutic Recreation, all whilst letting children \\"kick back, relax and raise a little hell\\". In summer of 2012, The Child Study Center at Yale Medical School began a study to measure the impact of SeriousFun camps on children with serious illness. 254 families using 12 SeriousFun camps including Over The Wall were studied and a number of outcomes were monitored one month after attending camp and then reavulated six months after camp. The study found significant improvements in outcomes including self-esteem, maturity, independence, maturity, quality of life measures and positive coping strategies, which were still maintained at the six month follow-up.

The MAZ-541 was all-wheel drive, but the front axle could be disengaged. The tractor was low to the ground to allow it to be closer to the aircraft's nose gear. There were two control stations, one for forward and the other for reverse. There were only three produced, which were in use until 1970.

The following list is based on . *San Nicol√°s (Nicole√±o): spoken in California, thought to be a Takic language. *Giamina/Omomil: Kroeber (1907) and Lamb (1964) believe Giamina may constitute a separate branch of Northern Uto- Aztecan, although Miller (1983) is uncertain about this. It was spoken in Southern California. *Vanyume: a Takic language of California *Acaxee (Aiage): closely related to Tahue, a Cahitan language, linked with Tebaca and Sabaibo. *Amotomanco (Otomoaco): uncertain classification, possibly Uto-Aztecan. (See Troike (1988) for more details.) *Cazcan (Caxcan): sometimes considered to be the same as Zacateca, although would only consider these to be geographical classifications. *Baciroa: closely connected to Tepahue *Basopa *Batuc: possibly an Opata dialect *Cahuimeto *Cahuameto: probably belongs with Oguera and Nio *Ch√≠nipa: may be a Tarahumaran language close to Ocoroni, since colonial sources claim the two are mutually intelligible. It may also instead be a local name for a variety of Guarij√≠o. *Coca: spoken near Lake Chapala. *Colotlan: a Pimic language closely related to Tepehuan, or Teul and Tepecano *Comanito: a Taracahitic language closely related to Tahue *Concho: probably a Taracahitic language (Troike 1988). Subdivisions include Chinarra and Chizo; Toboso is possibly related to Concho as well. *Conicari: a Taracahitic language closely related to Tahue *Guachichil: possibly a variant or close relative of Huichol *Guasave: possibly a Taracahitic language, or may instead be non-Uto-Aztecan language possibly related to Seri due to the speakers' maritime economy (Miller 1983). Dialects include Compopori, Ahome, Vacoregue, and Achire. *Guazapar (Guasapar): probably a Tarahumara dialect, or it may be more closely related to Guarij√≠o and Ch√≠nipa. Guazapar, Jova, Pachera, and Juhine may possibly all be dialects of Tarahumara. *Guisca (Coisa) *Hio: possibly a Taracahitic language *Huite: closely related to Ocoroni, and may be Taracahitic *Irritila: a Lagunero band *Jova (Jobal, Ova): most often linked with Opata, although some scholars classify it as a Tarahumara dialect. Miller (1983) considers it to be \\"probably Taracahitan.\\" *Jumano; also Humano, Jumana, Xumana, Chouman (from a French source), Zumana, Zuma, Suma, and Yuma. Suma is probably the same language, while Jumano is possibly Uto-Aztecan. (Not to be confused with the Jumana language of Colombia.) *Lagunero: may be the same as Irritila, and may also be closely related to Zacateco or Huichol. *Macoyahui: probably related to Cahita. *Mocorito: a Tahue language, which is Taracahitic. *Naarinuquia (Themurete?): Uto-Aztecan affiliation is likely, although it may instead be non-Uto-Aztecan language possibly related to Seri due to the speakers' maritime economy. *Nacosura: an Opata dialect *Nio: completely undocumented, although it is perhaps related to Ocoroni. *Ocoroni: most likely a Taracahitic language, and is reported to be mutually intelligible with Ch√≠nipa, and similar to Opata. Related languages may include Huite and Nio. *Oguera (Ohuera) *Patarabuey: unknown affiliation (Pur√©pecha region near Lake Chapala), and is possibly a Nahuatl dialect. *Tahue: may also include Comanito, Mocorito, Tubar, and Zoe. It is possibly a Taracahitic language, and is definitely not Nahuan. *Tanpachoa: unknown affiliation, and was once spoken along the R√≠o Grande. *Tecuexe: speakers were possibly part of a \\"Mexicano\\" (Nahua) colony. *Teco-Tecoxquin: an Aztecan language *Tecual: closely related to Huichol. According to Sauer (1934:14), the \\"Xamaca, by another name called Hueitzolme [Huichol], all ... speak the Thequalme language, though they differ in vowels.\\" *T√©mori: may be a Tarahumara dialect. *Tepahue: possibly a Taracahitic language. Closely related languages or dialects include Macoyahui, Conicari, and Baciroa. *Tepanec: an Aztecan language. *Teul (Teul-Chichimeca): a Pimic language, possibly of the Tepecano subgroup. *Toboso: grouped with Concho. *Topia: perhaps the same as Xixime (Jijime). *Topiame: possibly a Taracahitic language. *Totorame: grouped with Cora. *Xixime (Jijime): spoken by the Xiximes, possibly a Taracahitic language. Subdivisions are Hine and Hume. Its links with Acaxee are uncertain. *Zacateco: often considered the same as Acaxee, although this is uncertain. It is possibly related to Huichol, although Miller (1983) leaves it as unclassified. *Zoe: possibly a Taracahitic language, with Baimena as a subdivision. It is possibly affiliated with Comanito.

Biography =Career= De Caunes joined broadcasting in 1945, shortly after the Second World War, there he translated Voice of America into French for the National broadcaster Radiodiffusion fran√ßaise. When television was launched in 1949, De Caunes became one of the first newsreaders on National TV, for which he co-anchored with Pierre Tchernia and Claude Dargat. He later went freelance and in 1953 was offered a full-time presenting job on TMC, following a success on Monacan television, De Caunes was later offered a radio presenting job on the newly formed station Europe 1. Between 1964 and 1966 he was head anchor for the evening news on O.R.T.F and by 1967 he had moved to Radio Luxembourg to front the morning show.http://www.journaldesfemmes.com/people/amour/portrait/clan- de-caunes/6.shtml He made guest appearances in other television productions including a few episodes of Le Voyageur des si√®cles. He was also the French commentator at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1971, 1975 and 1977. He was also had a passion for theatre and in 1979 wrote a play entitled Com√©die pour un meurtre. He was also a keen sports presenter fronting several football matches across the world for French television =Personal life= De Caunes was married three times. His first wife was the writer Beno√Æte Groult, they had two daughters Blandine (born 1946) and Lison (born 1950). He left Groult for television presenter Jacqueline Joubert from whom they had a son Antoine (who is now one of France's best known entertainers and the host of Eurotrash). In 1960 De Caunes divorced Joubert and in 1967 he married reporter Anne-Marie Carmentrez they had two children together Marie and Pierre (who is now a presenter). De Caunes became a grandfather in 1977, when his son Antoine's wife gave birth to a girl: Emma de Caunes who is now a well-known actress in France. He was awarded both National Order of Merit and the Legion of Honour by President Fran√ßois Mitterrand. =Death and tribute= Following a long time of illness, De Caunes died on 28 June 2004.

Her parents move back to Haiti. While vacationing at her parents' house with her husband and child in Haiti, she is kidnapped. When her father, who by now has become a wealthy Haitian developer, refuses to pay her ransom, she is gang-raped and tortured by her captors, who keep her imprisoned for 13 days before finally releasing her. =\\"Happily Ever After\\"= In the first portion of the book, called \\"Happily Ever After,\\" the novel moves back and forth in time between Mireille's captivity and her earlier life, meeting and falling in love with husband Michael during graduate school in the Midwest of the United States. =\\"Once Upon a Time\\"= The latter section of the novel, \\"Once Upon a Time,\\" follows Mireille in the aftermath of her trauma, including her time living with Michael's mother, Lorraine, on the family farm in Nebraska. Themes Commentary on An Untamed State frequently cites the novel's emphasis on fairy tale. Reviewing the novel for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Daley suggests the fairy tale theme serves to translate unspeakable trauma: \\"Written from Mireille's perspective, 'An Untamed State' is an account of what is normally unaccountable: a level of trauma that, even if it is survived, is often too painful to relate. From the first sentence, we know Mireille has found a way to craft her story to make it bearable. She frames it as a fairy tale: 'Once upon a time, in a far-off land, I was kidnapped[...]'\\" In The New York Times, Holly Bass said in contrast to contemporary, happy- ending-focused fairy tales, Gay's interpretation of the genre recalled \\"the real horrors of the original Brothers Grimm stories and their ilk...that a passing stranger raped Sleeping Beauty as she lay unconscious, or that Snow White‚Äôs jealous stepmother not only called for her death but wanted to eat her liver and lungs. Roxane Gay‚Äôs striking debut novel, 'An Untamed State,' is a fairy tale in this vein, its complex and fragile moral arrived at through great pain and high cost.\\" Reception =Reviews= An Untamed State received positive reviews upon publication. Nolan Feeney writing for Time (magazine) called it a \\"riveting debut\\" that \\"captivates from its opening sentence and doesn‚Äôt let go.\\" The Los Angeles Times called it \\"suspenseful, immediate and realistic.\\" The A.V. Club awarded it an A letter grade and praised it as \\"a gripping psychological portrait of how trauma remakes the body to respond only to itself.\\" =Awards= Gay was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, Fiction in 2015 for An Untamed State. Adaptation In March 2016 director Gina Prince-Bythewood announced she would be adapting the novel into a feature film for Fox Searchlight. Prince-Bythewood and Gay will co-write the film, to star Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Prince-Bythewood will direct and will also produce with Michael De Luca. Prince-Bythewood and Mbatha-Raw previously collaborated on Beyond the Lights.

Janet Leeper (1945). English Ballet, King Penguin Its influence was disproportionate to its short life. Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of The Royal Ballet, saw it as \\"having done much for the cause of English ballet\\", Ninette de Valois (1937). Invitation to the ballet, The Bodley Head and Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online credits it with \\"keeping ballet alive in England during the early 1930s\\". The society was named after the eighteenth-century French dancer Marie Anne de Cupis de Camargo. The scene in 1930 Ballets Russes had held a London season most years but when Sergei Diaghilev died in 1929 the company collapsed, heavily in debt.Arnold Haskell (1935). Diaghileff, GollanczSerge Lifar (1940). Diaghilev, Putnam Its successor company had not yet been formed. Pavlova's company had given its last London season ever, as it was to die with Pavlova herself in January 1931. Marie Rambert only started the small scale Ballet Club (later Ballet Rambert) in the autumn of 1930 with its first performance in 1931, Lionel Bradley (1946). Sixteen Years of Ballet Rambert, Hinrichsen Edition Ltd and Ninette de Valois was to found the Vic-Wells (later the Royal Ballet) in 1931 with 6 salaried dancers. Zoe Anderson (2006). The Royal Ballet - 75 years, Faber and Faber International Ballet and the Festival Ballet were years away. Britain's best known dancers Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin had been in England since the collapse of Ballets Russes but had no large scale company to dance for. In 1930 serious professional ballet in London was at a low point and in the rest of the country was non-existent. Formation The Camargo Society was conceived by Arnold Haskell (ballet critic and prolific author), Philip Richardson (editor of Dancing Times) and Edwin Evans (music critic), and named after the 18th century ballerina Marie Camargo who first shortened her skirts and wore dancing slippers without heels. Its aim was \\"to perpetuate the principles on which Diaghilev had run the Ballets Russes, as a fusion of dance, music and decor\\", encouraging British talent to create ballet on a scale that could not be attempted by the Ballet Club or the fledgling Vic-Wells. The society intended to put on several Sunday evening and Monday afternoon performances each season at a West End theatre, commissioning the choreography and decor for each ballet and hiring an orchestra for each performance. The necessary funds would be provided by a subscription audience. The committee included the young composer Constant Lambert as resident conductor, the semi-retired ballerina Lydia Lopokova as choreographic advisor and her husband the eminent economist John Maynard Keynes as treasurer. Haskell himself described the society as ‚Äúa management without a company‚Äù. Productions The society's first performance, at the Cambridge Theatre in October 1930, was a mixed programme of one-act ballets. The one received best was Pomona by the rising choreographer Frederick Ashton, Julie Kavanagh (1996). Secret Muses: the life of Frederick Ashton. Faber and Faber in which Anton Dolin partnered the American ballerina Anna Ludmila in the lead roles. Ashton also created pieces for the December performance at the Arts Theatre Club; Job, A Masque of Poetry and Music, of which the critics did not know what to make, and a series of tableaux illustrating Shakespeare's narrative poem A Lover's Complaint in which Lopokova herself took a part. In total the Camargo Society produced 16 new one-act ballets. Fa√ßade, also by Ashton to William Walton's existing score of the same name, is the one that lived longest and is still remembered today. It later went into the repertoires of both the Ballet Club and the Vic-Wells, but the Vic-Wells lost their Fa√ßade sets and costumes when they fled Holland in May 1940 hours ahead of the German occupation. After several more modest ventures the society hired the Savoy Theatre in 1932 for an ambitious four week summer season, in which Olga Spessivtseva danced the lead parts in shortened versions of Giselle and Swan Lake. The other productions were Ballade (Chopin), The Enchanted Grove (Ravel), Fete polonaise (Mikhail Glinka), High Yellow (Spike Hughes), Job (Vaughan Williams), The Lord of Burleigh (Mendelssohn), Mars and Venus (Scarlatti), Mercure (Satie), The Origin of Design (Handel), Regatta (Gavin Gordon) and The Rio Grande (Constant Lambert).Lloyd, Stephen. Beyond the Rio Grande (2014), p 173 This enterprise put the society seriously in debt. Its debts were cleared with two gala performances of Copp√©lia at the Royal Opera House in June 1933 when the major stars Markova, Dolin and Lopokova danced to full houses, including the then Queen, members of the government and a visiting international conference of economists. The end of the society This however was the society's last venture. Ninette de Valois' company was now firmly established and tackling larger productions than the Ballet Club could, and to the Vic-Wells the society bequeathed all its sets and productions except Fa√ßade. Constant Lambert went to the Vic-Wells as musical director and stayed until he died in 1951. Frederick Ashton went as resident choreographer and stayed to become Director when de Valois retired, as well as a choreographer of world repute. Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin went there as principal dancers. They only stayed 2 years, but by the time they moved on to form their own company Robert Helpmann and Harold Turner and the 16-year-old Margot Fonteyn were able to take on their roles. P.W.Manchester (1947). Vic- Wells: a Ballet Progress, Gollancz The Vic-Wells would perhaps have grown to the stature of the Royal Ballet without the Camargo Society, but there is no doubt that the Camargo Society helped the Vic Wells considerably in its formative phase.

Biography  A native of Awana, a place near Baghdad, Ibn Baqiyya belonged to a low-class family. Because of this, he would later get suspected by his opponents in helping low- class statesman to prominent posts. He first appears during conquest of Abbasid Iraq by Buyid ruler Mu'izz al-Dawla. He soon rapidly rose to higher posts, and by 973 managed to become the vizier of Mu'izz al-Dawla's son and successor, Izz al-Dawla (r. 967‚Äì978). However, hostiles slowly arose between Izz al-Dawla and his cousin Adud al-Dawla, who ruled in Fars and Kerman. Ibn Baqiyya, who knew of the strong power which Adud al-Dawla possessed, sought to gain his favor. In 975, Adud al-Dawla invaded Iraq; meanwhile Izz al-Dawla suspected Ibn Baqiyya of treachery, and after his defeat at Ahvaz in 977 by Adud al-Dawla, removed Ibn Baqiyya from the vizierate and had him blinded. After a bloody struggle, Adud al-Dawla managed in the end to defeat Izz al- Dawla and have him executed. Ibn Baqiyya was spared, but because an insult he had made to Adud al-Dawla he was later arrested by a force sent by Adud al- Dawla under Bahram ibn Ardashir al-Majusi and other statesmen; Ibn Baqiyya was shortly trampled to death, and would first be buried after the death of Adud al-Dawla in 983.

Recording In a press release, Harris explained the title The Man Who Died in His Boat: Speaking of the main protagonist implied in the title of the album, Drowned in Sound columnist Tim Peyton writes: \\"The mysterious pathos of this incident suits Grouper well. As Harris explains, 'the boat never crashed or capsized... (it) just slipped off somehow. And the boat, like a riderless horse, eventually came back home.' This haunting return of an unmanned vessel is spooky in a similar way to Harris's ethereal, multi tracked vocals.\\" Critical reception The aggregate review site Metacritic assigns an average score of 81 out of 100 to The Man Who Died in His Boat based on 17 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". The song \\"Vital\\" was chosen as \\"Best New Track\\" by Pitchfork on December 20, 2012, and the site later placed it at number 88 on their list of the Top 100 Tracks of 2013.

In 1942, he was murdered by the Nazis during the Occupation of France. Born in Saint Petersburg, he left the USSR in 1922 at the end of the Civil War. He settled in Paris and studied at the Lyc√©e Henri IV and the Sorbonne University. A pupil of French philosopher Victor Basch, he worked on aesthetics and wrote an essay, L'Esth√©tique fran√ßaise contemporaine (French contemporan aesthetic), F√©lix Alcan, 1936. Involved in public activities as a teacher of philosophy, he supported as an antifascist the Front populaire and the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. He joined the French Communist Party in 1937. Among his friends were Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Gaston Bachelard and Georges Politzer. In September 1939, he volunteered for the French Army despite suffering from a heart condition. Mobilized as a soldier in Rethel, he began to write his Journal de guerre in January 1940 in the middle of the Phoney War. He survived several air attacks and bombardments during the Fall of France (May‚ÄìJune 1940).Valentin Feldman, Journal de guerre, 1940-1941, Farrago, 2006, p. 175. Under the German Occupation he was a teacher in Dieppe but suffered from the first French Statute on Jews (October 1940). He was finally excluded from teaching in July 1941. By that time, he was already active in the French Resistance. From 1940, he was liaison officer between Dieppe, Rouen and Paris. After a year, he wrote the texts against the collaborationist Vichy regime and the Germans in the clandestine newspaper L'Avenir normand in Dieppe, and wrote several texts for the clandestine Parisian review La Pens√©e libre, supervised by Georges Politzer, Jacques Decour and Jacques Solomon. Becoming part of the underground, he joined a group of communist Resistance in Rouen, where he participated in actions against the German occupiers. Arrested in February 1942 after the sabotage of a factory, he was imprisoned and tortured. Judged in Paris, he was condemned to death by a German military tribunal. He refused to sign his appeal for a reprieve. Feldman was executed by a firing squad on 27 July 1942. Addressing the German soldiers just before the salvo, he called out to them: \\"Imbeciles, it is for you that I die! \\"Valentin Feldman, Journal de guerre, 1940-1941, Farrago, 2006, p. 7.

The Ballet Royal de la Nuit (Royal Ballet of the Night), Ballet Royal de la Nuict in its original spelling and often referred to simply as the Ballet de la Nuit, is a ballet de cour with a libretto by Isaac de Benserade and music by Jean de Cambefort, Jean-Baptiste Bo√´sset, Michel Lambert and possibly others, which premiered on February 23, 1653, at the Salle du Petit- Bourbon in Paris.Bjurstr√∂m 1962, pp. 157‚Äì159. It took 13 hours to perform and debuted fourteen year old Louis XIV as Apollo, the Sun King (Le Roi Soleil).Burden & Thorp 2009, p. 3.  Plot and music outline  The Ballet de la Nuit concerned the four Watches (veilles) of the night, beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening and ending at 6 o'clock in the morning: the first watch (sunset) lasted from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.; the second, from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m.; the third, from 12 a.m. to 3 a.m., and the fourth (sunrise), from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. With airs by Jean de Cambefort, it was an extravagant court spectacle featuring forty-five entrees and three ballets within a ballet, which took about 13 hours to perform. The plot included mythological goddesses such as Venus and Diana, werewolves, demonic creatures and witches who celebrated a black Sabbath in the horrors of the night. Shepherds, gypsies, thieves, lamplighters, beggars and crippled are among the ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù characters of the play. King Louis XIV appears with the coming of the day as the sun god Apollo, one of his many personifications as the rising sun, emphasizing the power of the monarchy and its closeness to the divine.Susan Au,Ballet and Modern Dance, second edition  Costumes  Henri de Gissey (c. 1621‚Äì73), Dessinateur ordinaire du Cabinet du Roy, was in charge of dress design for the royal ballets.

The symposium met at Waddesdon Manor, where the folio volume (Rothschild B1/16/6) with the arms of Louis Hesselin on the cover that contains stage and costumes designs is kept. It also met at Oxford on the same day, where papers were given on many aspects of the ballet. Michael Burden and Jennifer Thorp subsequently published a volume Ballet de la Nuit: Rothschild B1/16/6 with the Pendragon Press in New York. The essays in the volume are: Michael Burden \\"The Ballet de la Nuit\\"; David Parrott: \\"Art, ceremony and performance: Cardinal Mazarin and cultural patronage at the court of Louis XIV\\"; Jennifer Thorp: \\"Dances and dancers in the Ballet de la Nuit\\"; and Catherine Massip: \\"The Ballet de la Nuit: a political and musical statement\\". The foreword is by Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild. The volume also includes some of the surviving sources for the ballet, including a facsimile of the livret and a reproduction of the scenography from Rothschild B1/16/6. It also includes a modern edition of the surviving music by Lionel Sawkins. This was the first ballet de cour to be published in complete form.

Grace Benny, was the first woman elected to local government in Australia when she was elected to the Brighton Council in 1919. She represented the Seacliff ward from November 1919 until December 1921. Early life Benny was born in the Crown Inn Hotel, Currie Street, Adelaide on 8 October 1872 to Peter Anderson and Agnes Ellen Anderson, n√©e Harriot. She grew up on the family's sheep station \\"Springfield\\", located near Stansbury, Yorke Peninsula. She married her cousin, solicitor Benjamin Benny (21 October 1869 ‚Äì 10 February 1935), eldest son of the Reverend George Benny, on 16 July 1896, and moved to Adelaide where he worked. The couple moved to Seacliff in Adelaide's south and raised three daughters and two sons. Benny was active in a range of community and political organisations, and during the First World War was the Honorary Secretary of the Seacliff Cheer-Up Society. She was also a member of the local Progress Association, and spinning and croquet clubs. Political career Following World War I, Benny was a member of the Liberal Union Sturt District committee and president of the Brighton Women's Branch of the Liberal Union, and was elected president of the Women's Branch of the South Australian Liberal Union in 1918. During this time she argued strongly for equality of divorce for women, which became law in South Australia in 1918. Following the lead of her husband, who was mayor of Brighton City Council 1903‚Äì1905, Benny became the first female local government councillor in Australia. In November 1919, on petition of ratepayers, she was appointed to represent the newly created South ward (later called Seacliff) of Brighton Council. She stood for election the following month, believing that there was work to be done in the area that only a woman could do. She was duly elected on 22 December 1919, and held this seat at the following election. In 1922 she stood unsuccessfully for mayor, a defeat welcomed by at least one (Catholic) commentator. As a council member Benny successfully argued for public access to the beach, the installation of electric lights and the allocation of reserves for a children's playground and public garden. She also actively supported the abolition of segregated sea- bathing so that families could swim together. In 1921 Grace Benny was made a Justice of the Peace, hearing cases relating to state children, police matters and women. Controversy Her husband Benjamin Benny was elected to the Australian Senate in 1919, resigning in January 1926 after suffering a stroke. He was immediately sued for misappropriating various trust funds, and in June 1926 was convicted of the fraudulent conversion of Treasury bonds to the value of ¬£1,200, as well as various other trust funds. He was sentenced to three years' gaol, struck off the roll of the Supreme Court, of which he was a practitioner, and declared insolvent. The Benny home \\"Stoneywood\\", a property overlooking the Seacliff foreshore reserve, was put up for sale in 1925. Later life Following her husband's imprisonment, Benny was forced to rely on money she had inherited to support her children. Although she had never worked for a living, she moved into her husband's law offices in King William Street, Adelaide and opened the \\"Elite Employment Agency\\", which enabled her to support her family through the Depression Benjamin Benny died in 1935. On 23 February 1940 in Melbourne, Grace married Cecil Ralph Bannister. 20 years her junior, Bannister was a tramway worker and clerk before moving to Adelaide to live with Grace.

It was launched in the southern town of Barawa, Somalia in October 2013.  Operation  On 5 October 2013, Al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab announced that Western naval forces had launched an assault on a house in the insurgent stronghold of Barawe, a town situated around south of Mogadishu. He stated that the foreign soldiers had silencer guns, and exchanged gunfire and grenades with the militants before being driven away. Musab later asserted that the attack was launched by the UK SAS unit as well as Turkish special forces, and that one British commander was killed during the raid and four other SAS operatives were fatally wounded. Additionally, a Somali intelligence official indicated that a Chechen Al- Shabaab leader was the target of the mission, and that the insurgent commander was wounded during the offensive and one of his guards was killed. Somali police stated that the operation had the approval of the Somali government, and that seven individuals were killed during the mission. Both NATO and EU Navfor denied involvement in the raid, as did a Turkish Foreign Ministry representative. A spokeswoman for the British Defence Ministry also said that she and her colleagues were not aware of any British involvement in the operation. According to another Somali intelligence official, the target of the raid was Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Godane (Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr). A senior US military representative also indicated that Seal Team Six, the special force unit responsible for killing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, launched the offensive but later abandoned the mission after coming under more fire than expected. Speaking about the aborted mission, US Secretary of State John Kerry said that the insurgents \\"can run but they can't hide\\". A spokesman for the Pentagon likewise asserted that US soldiers had been involved in a counter- terrorism mission in Somalia against a known Al-Shabaab member, but did not elaborate. He also indicated that there were no US fatalities during the operation. US officials later confirmed that the target of the raid was Al- Shabaab commander Abdikadar Mohamed Abdikadar \\"Ikrima\\".

Although there is a tradition of making blades in the town, the Aguilar workshop is the only one that still makes all pieces by hand, with no industrialization. The work of this craftsman, and that of his brother, Angel, have been used in movies. The workshop exports directly to buyers such as theaters, martial arts enthusiasts and collectors in both Mexico and the United States. Origin of workshop Family workshop with stone and brick furnace in the background Aguilar Velasco was born and raised in Ocotl√°n de Morelos in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. This town is known for its handcrafts, especially pottery. There is also a tradition of blacksmithing. Apolinar and his brother Angel learned this craft from their uncle Ricardo Guzm√°n and formally established a workshop in 1970. The uncle died later in 1985, at the age of 110. Although Angel has since died, Apolinar continues the family tradition and has become even more well-known than his brother. Handcrafted steel Partially worked machete The Aguilar workshop is one of forty five which produce artistic blades, but it is the only one that still produces their pieces completely by hand, using traditional techniques, using hammers, anvils and a furnace made of stone and brick heated by wood. Each piece is unique in some way. The others have industrialized the production on one way or another, which Apolinar says makes the blades less expensive, but of poorer quality. Apolinar works with another brother by the name of Jes√∫s Aguilar Velasco, and their base materials is scrap metal from autos and construction sites. The business The workshop has provided blades to various clients. One of their best-known pieces is the sword used by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movies Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer. This piece was made by Angel after their work was discovered by a Hollywood producer at an artisans‚Äô fair in Texas. Another important pieces include one sold to Amalia Sol√≥razo de C√°rdenas, who then gave it to Mexican president Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz, and swords for two other movies. Apolinar and the workshop work with various shamans from Catemaco, Chiapas, Guatemala and Asia who order knives for ritual use. Their clients also include the Colegio Militar, theaters, martial arts enthusiasts, Boy Scouts, first responders and collectors in Mexico and the United States. The artisan sells directly and shuns intermediaries. The workshop is open to tourists who can see the processes of traditional blacksmithing. However, the trade has suffered from the fall in tourism to Oaxaca since 2006 and cheaper imports from China. Since 1986, The workshop has exported their blades on their own to the United States although recently it has been more problematic with tightening rules for weapons both in Mexico and the U.S. Apolinar has requested state and municipal authorities to support traditional metalwork but without success.

It was the home of Gustav Roedde and his family. The house was built in 1893 and was allegedly designed by architect Francis Rattenbury in the Queen Anne Revival style. After having been a rooming house for years, the house was restored and refurnished in the 1980s and has been open to the public as a museum since 1990.  The Roedde Family  Gustav Roedde (1860-1930) emigrated from Grossbodungen, Germany to Cleveland, US in 1882 where he completed his apprenticeship as a bookbinder. During a Halloween party, he met Matilda Cassebohm (1862-1951), who emigrated from the island of Helgoland, Germany. The two were married in Cleveland in 1883. Together they lived in different cities; San Francisco, California and Victoria, British Columbia, before settling down in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1888. Gustav Roedde's bookbindery blossomed along with Vancouver's quick development. His skills, such as the paper marbling technique, made him a successful businessman. The company continues to operate as G.A. Roedde Printers under new ownership. The family grew to include seven children and three St. Bernard dogs. The family's first born, Anna Henrietta died at age four after eating poisoned berries. When World War I began, the sons Walter Herman Widemann (adopted) and William August travelled to Europe to fight for the British army and returned safely. During that time, daughter Emma Cather moved back to the Roedde House with her two daughters, Emma Gwendolyn and Kathleen Frances. Stories have been passed down, that the children used to play in the upstairs storage room to hear the adults‚Äô conversations on the lower floor. In 1925, daughter Anna Catherine was killed at age 28, while on duty as a nurse at the Vancouver General Hospital. During the same year, the family moved to a new home on Drummond Drive, in Point Grey.  House history  Heritage building plaque on Roedde House. Roedde House was named a Class-A Heritage Building in 1970 by the City of Vancouver. The house's alleged architect, Francis Rattenbury (1867-1935), was an ambitious English immigrant. He also designed The Empress Hotel and Vancouver's 1910 provincial courthouse (currently the Vancouver Art Gallery). The Roedde House's asymmetrical plans, verandas and turret are all features of the Queen Anne Revival style. Both the interior and exterior of the house are made of cedar and fir, due to the cheap availability of lumber at the time. In the late 1970s, the house was at risk of being demolished. The Community of Arts Council of Vancouver urged that the building not be torn down due to its historical significance. They succeeded and the house was designated a ‚ÄúClass A Heritage Building‚Äù in 1976, which meant that the house could not be moved, nor the exterior walls changed. The City of Vancouver restored the exterior of the house. In 1984, the Roedde House Preservation Society was formed to implement the interior restoration. Historical records were used to insure the house replicated what it would have looked like between 1893 and 1925. Stripping down wallpaper helped discover the original colours of the walls and the house was furnished with all the accoutrements of middle-class life in the 1890s. On May 12, 1990, the Roedde House Museum was officially opened by then-Mayor Gordon Campbell.  The Museum  The museum's collection of over 2,700 artifacts includes furniture, clothing, books and household items; some of which were owned by the Roedde family. Highlights include, the George III longcase clock manufactured in 1775, the upright Steinway piano dated 1893 and other interesting items like the stereoscope, the chestnut roaster and the universal bread maker. In addition to guided tours, the museum features Classical and Jazz Concert series. On Sunday Tea and Tour, the museum serves the ‚ÄúRoedde House Blend‚Äù, made especially by the Metropolitan Tea Company for the Museum.  References  1\\\\. Roedde House Museum Website 2\\\\.

The koto-furunushi (; English: \\"old master koto\\") is a fictitious being from Japanese folklore. It is a Y≈çkai and is said to be harmless to humans. The koto-furunushi is very similar to the yokai biwa-bokuboku.  Description  The koto-furunushi has the appearance of a traditional koto (a Japanese zither), which grows a demonic face on its front. The strings start to meander into all directions, giving the impression of an uncombed mane. However, it is not handed down if the koto-furunushi can move on its own in any kind.Hiroko Yoda, Matt Alt: Yokai Attack!: The Japanese Monster Survival Guide. Tuttle Publishing, Rutland 2013, , p. 64.Hisashi Yamauchi: „ÇÇ„ÅÆ„ÅÆ„Åë. H≈çsei daigaku shuppan-kyoku, Tokio 2004, , p. 304.  Folklore  A famous legend comes from Saga prefecture on Ky≈´sh≈´ peninsula and is said to originate from the 2nd century A.D. It tells the story of the Emperor of Japan who had planned a palatial feast for his royal court. He chose Kanzaki as the festive place and he ordered his gardeners to clean and groom the chosen park. The legend reports that the emperor was so excited about the resulting beauty of the festive place that he left an enchanted koto as a present to the town of Kanzaki. A short time later, the koto magically transformed itself into a lush and noble camphor tree. From this day, it was told for centuries, that anybody who took a rest at the roots of the tree could hear the faint but irresistibly calming sounds of a harp or zither from the treetop. Today, it is told that the exact whereabouts of the holy tree was forgotten in time, but the ghost of the camphor tree may dive into very old kotos to animate them.Shigeru Mizuki: . Futami Shob≈ç, Tokyo 1999, , p. 84-86.  Background  The koto-furunushi belongs to a special group of y≈çkai: the tsukumogami (). Tsukumogami are derived from or possess various kinds of man-made household artifacts, such as kitchenware, tools, and everyday accessories, and though 100 years may pass, the artifact appears as good as if it was never in use.Michaela Haustein: Mythologien der Welt: Japan, Ainu, Korea. ePubli, Berlin 2011, , p. 25. Koto- furunushi are said to come to life when \\"reaching their 100th birthday\\", but only if they were always treated with great respect. If so, they will always play the most enchanting music on their own, especially, when no one watches them. Most times, the koto-furunushi will perform the songs that were played on them very often and with special devotion. If a koto-furunushi is instead ignored by its owner, it will become sad and then ask other tsukumogami to take it along with them. It then will play for its tsukumogami friends, forgetting its neglectful owner in time.  References   External links  Description of the Koto-furunushi at Yokai.com.

A largely ribbon development along the main road, the village is surrounded by farmland. Name The village takes its name from Tysilio, a 7th-century Welsh saint to whom the parish church is dedicated. History Ancient remains indicate that the area that is now the village of Llandissilio has been occupied for many centuries. For part of its history the parish of Llandissilio was in Carmarthenshire. The parish was originally part of the Hundred of Derllys in Carmarthenshire. A Visitation of the Archdeaconry of Carmarthen in 1710 found that of about 120 families in the parish, 40 attended church at Easter, 20 at Whitsuntide and 20 at Christmas and noted \\"the Minister suffers in his reputation for being addicted to drinking and swearing\\" and \\"the roof of the north side of the Chancell lies open to the wind & weather.\\" The population of the parish of Llandissilio West in 1801 was 281. By 1981 the population had grown to 458. In 1891, 97% were Welsh- speaking, and 75% spoke only Welsh; 10 years later those speaking only Welsh had fallen to 29%. By 1981, 70% still spoke Welsh, but only 1% were not English-speaking. Evacuees, 1940 In 1831 nearly half of men over 20 years were agricultural labourers, and nearly a quarter were farmers employing them. The rest of the male population was engaged in retail or handicrafts. Slate quarrying and corn milling were carried out in the 19th century. Boys from Creek Road LCC School, Greenwich, London, were evacuated to Llandissilio during World War 2 (pictured). The War Memorial records the names of ten men of the parish who were killed in World War 1 and World War 2, and the memorial was Grade II listed in 2004. Environment Llandissilio is situated on the Landsker Borderlands Trail, a circular waymarked long distance footpath running through Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire. The village is surrounded by farmland with deciduous trees. Near the south of the village is the source of the River Conyn which then flows south-west to meet the Eastern Cleddau. Worship Parish church ca 1885 St Tysilio Parish Church is in the Diocese of St David's. The church was Grade II listed in 1971 under the auspices of Cadw; it has mediaeval origins, and has been restored since. Blaenconin Baptist Chapel is on the outskirts of the village. Waldo Williams is buried there. A drawing of Blaenconin chapel by the artist John Piper illustrates John Betjeman's collection of essays on architecture, First and Last Loves (2012). John Piper's photograph of the chapel is held in the Tate collection. Education Brynconin Community School (Welsh: Ysgol Brynconin) educates children from 3 to 11 years. Teaching is in English and Welsh languages, and (in 2011) 40% of pupils spoke Welsh at home. Amenities The village has a post office, two pubs (The Angel and The Bush), hotel, holiday park and retail premises. Governance The community of Llandissilio West, in which the village lies, is part of Maenclochog electoral division of Pembrokeshire County Council which elects one county councillor.

He founded and led the Arzamas School of Painting, Russia's first provincially based art school. Biography He was the illegitimate son of a nobleman.Richard Stites: Serfdom, Society, and the Arts in Imperial Russia, Yale University Press, , @ Google Books In 1787, he became an apprentice at the icon-painting workshop in Temnikov.Temnikov website: \\"They were born, lived, worked, visited...\\" Upon completing his course in 1799, he went to Saint Petersburg for further studies at the Imperial Academy of Arts under Ivan Akimov. In 1802, he left with a certificate (second-degree) and 200 rubles for expenses, courtesy of the Academy's Director. He then returned to Arzamas where he used some of the money to start the first, and for a long time only, private art school outside a major city. In 1809, the Academy took a supportive interest in his school, honoring him with the title of \\"Academician\\" and sending original art works or plaster casts for his students to copy; issuing silver medals as incentives. Many well-known artists began their studies with Stupin, including Evgraf Krendovsky, and Vasily Perov. In 1836, finding himself overwhelmed by operating the school and teaching, he hired one of his former students to be superintendent. Seven years later, the school and his home were destroyed by a fire. He claimed that the fire was started by \\"envious\\" people, apparently choosing to ignore the fact that there had been tension between the school and the community due to the use of nude models and plaster statues, which one local priest had condemned as \\"idols\\". He recovered and rebuilt, however, and by 1846 there was a small museum with a library. In 1862, not long after Stupin's death, the school was closed.

This village is a sacred place for the aboriginal communities like the Paniyas, Kurumbas and Kattu Nayakas. Today the population of the village is a mixture of migrated Sri Lankan Tamils, Gowdas and Kerala Muslims. The village is famous for small- scale gold mining activities conducted by the tribal people.

It was named after the Prince of Orange () Willem-Alexander to commemorate his coronation as King of the Netherlands. Description Penicillium vanoranjei is distinguished from related species by an unusual bright-orange sclerotia when in colonies; the research team who identified it called the color \\"astonishing; none of our researchers had ever seen anything like it before.\\" The sclerotia have well- defined, complex internal structure. Conidiophores are monoverticillate (unbranched). The cell walls of fungus have a distinct roughening. It produces an external cell-matrix that might help protect it against dehydration during times of drought. Colonies of P. vanoranjei are slightly raised in the center; mycelia are white near the margins. Penicillium vanoranjei was identified using a combination of morphological traits and genetic analysis on soil samples taken from Tunisia. It is unknown whether the fungus can be used to make penicillin. In May 2014, the International Institute for Species Exploration listed P. vanoranjei as one of the \\"Top 10 News Species\\" named in 2013. Taxonomic history Penicillium vanoranjei and five similar species ‚Äì Penicillium maximae, Penicillium amaliae, Penicillium alexiae, and Penicillium arianeae ‚Äì were set to be named in April 2013. That same month, Prince of Orange () Willem-Alexander was set to become the king of Netherlands. Inspired by the orange colors of P. vanoranjei, Pedro Crous and his colleagues at the Fungal Biodiversity Centre decided to \\"pay a humorous but respectful tribute by naming the new moulds after the new King of the Netherlands and his family.\\" The species were formally described in the journal Persoonia. The naming attracted attention on social media, and was covered by international media. In the Netherlands, the naming was especially well-covered including TV news stories and radio interviews of the paper's authors. The Penicillium species are not the first to be named after royalty, though. For example the lily Victoria regia was named after the United Kingdom's Queen Victoria.

Note that GAT2 is different from BGT1 despite the fact that the latter transporter is sometimes referred at as (mouse) GAT-2. All these transporters are highly hydrophobic proteins with 12 transmembrane segments, extracellular glycosylation sites, and intracellular consensus sites for phosphorylation, and there is over 50% amino acid homology between each of them. Each binds GABA with varying affinities with BGT1 having the lowest affinity and GAT3 the highest. GAT2 (SLC6A13) is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes in the liver, but is also found in proximal tubules in the kidney as well as in the leptomeninges and in some blood vessels in the brain. Biological function =Brain= Deletion of the GAT2 gene in mice does not appear to have any dramatic effects on brain function in a normal situation. The only difference noted so far is a slight elevation of brain Taurine levels. This was an unexpected finding, but is in agreement with the notion that GAT2 permits efflux of GABA and taurine from the brain to circulating blood through the blood brain barrier. GAT1 and GAT3 have higher concentrations in the brain and have higher affinity to GABA. This makes them more likely than GAT2 to influence the activity of neurotransmitter GABA in the brain. =Liver= GAT2 is expressed in hepatocytes and is well positioned to take up GABA entering the liver from the intestine (via the portal vein), but it is not known if this is an important function. On the other hand, GAT2 is also able to transport taurine and it appears to be the major taurine transporter in the liver. =Kidneys= GAT2 is also present in proximal tubules in the kidney cortex, but only in the basolateral membranes. The physiological function is unknown. Clinical significance The clinical significance of GAT2 is at present undetermined. Some anticonvulsants have been reported to act upon the GABA transporters. There is evidence to suggest that GABA transporters are linked to epilepsy, affective disorders, and schizophrenia. But considering that GAT1 and GAT3 are expressed at far higher levels in brain tissue, it is likely that inhibition of these transporters will have a far greater anticonvulsant effect than inhibition of GAT2 and BGT1.

It uses recommendation algorithms and data science to personalize clothing items based on size, budget and style. The company was founded in 2011 and had an initial public offering in 2017 with a valuation of $1.6 billion. Stitch Fix generated more than $1 billion in sales during 2018 and reported 3.4 million customers in June 2020. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California and employs 8,000 people worldwide. History Stitch Fix delivery box Stitch Fix was founded in 2011 by Katrina Lake and former J.Crew buyer Erin Morrison Flynn. The business was originally called Rack Habit, and was initially run out of Lake's apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company began by catering only to women, but it has subsequently expanded to men's clothing, plus sizes, maternity wear, and kids. In 2014, Stitch Fix started to be profitable. In July 2016, the company ended its fiscal year with recorded sales of $730 million, and in May 2017, the company had raised $42 million from outside investors. In November 2017, the company went public on NASDAQ. It was the first female-led company to launch an IPO in over a year. In October 2018, several class action lawsuits were brought against Stitch Fix alleging that the company had violated federal securities laws by making misleading statements about its growth prospects. As of 2019, the company had 8,000 employees including 5,100 stylists and more than 100 data scientists. On June 2, 2020, the company announced layoffs for 1,400 employees, which was 18% of its total workforce, all of whom are remote workers in California. The affected employees were given the option of remaining with the company if they relocate. The online retailer also announced it will hire roughly 2,000 stylists in cities that have a lower cost of living than those in California such as Austin, Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis and Pittsburgh.  Service  Stitch Fix is a personal styling service that sends individually picked clothing and accessories items for a one-time styling fee. Customers fill out a survey online about their style preferences. A stylist at the company picks five items to send to the customer. Stylists pick items based on a customer's survey answers and any access the customer gives them to their social media outlets. The customer schedules a date to receive their items, which is referred to as a \\"Fix\\". Once the shipment is received, the customer has three days to choose to keep the items or return some or all of them. If the customer keeps at least one item, the initial styling fee is credited towards the cost of the item. In addition to the styling fee being credited, if the customer decides to keep all five items, the customer receives 25% off the total cost of the items. Customers choose the shipping frequency, such as every two weeks, once a month, or every two months. The company also supports integration with Pinterest boards, allowing customers to add photos of fashion looks that they like. These boards may be viewed by a Stitch Fix stylist. The company uses data science and has combined personal stylists and machine learning (AI) for personalized recommendation. Media Stitch Fix was referenced in a Wired article about recommendation algorithms, data science and astrophysics in Silicon Valley. Wired also highlighted a new feature known as \\"Shop Your Looks,\\" which suggests items matched to those previously purchased by customers. Fast Company profiled the company and called attention to \\"its data prowess across every aspect of its business to reinvent the $334 billion U.S. apparel industry.\\" It was recognized as one of the \\"50 Most Innovative Companies\\" for 2019. Stitch Fix hosted a Golden Globes-like red carpet event in the 59 St-Columbus Circle subway station in New York City and had a 60-second spot before the 2019 Academy Awards.
