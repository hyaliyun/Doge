His work is considered modern and neorealistic. Authoring the immensely popular novel, Nordkraft, which sold more than 100,000 copies, an unusually high sales figure on the book market in Denmark, Ejersbo became an established writer. A tale about three young people and drug problems in Aalborg, the work was turned into a film in 2005, directed by Ole Christian Madsen. Ejersbo is also well known for writing what is known as the Africa Trilogy (the three novels, Liberty, Revolution, and Eksil), inspired by the author's own childhood experiences in Tanzania. The trilogy was published posthumously, however. Jakob Ejersbo died from a malign case of esophageal cancer after an illness period of only 10 months. Johannes Riis, publishing editor at the major Danish publishing house, Gyldendal, spoke at the funeral, saying: \\"Og nu st√•r jeg s√• her, i en frysende klar og ubarmhjertig bevidsthed om, at jeg i l√∏bet af det sidste √•rs tid har v√¶ret vidne til noget af det mest urimelige og meningsl√∏se, jeg har oplevet i mit liv.

The paper's circulation of 800 copies was the second-highest in Hampshire County, after the South Branch Intelligencer's. The Virginia Argus ceased publication following its closure by the Union Army during the American Civil War, after which it was not revived. The Virginia Argus documented the pursuit of fugitive slave Jacob Green by the Parsons family of Romney in 1856, and the ensuing dispute between the Parsons family and Charles James Faulkner over legal fees in 1857. At the time of the dispute, Faulkner was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Virginia's 8th congressional district; he later served as the United States Minister to France, and again as a member of the United States House of Representatives from West Virginia's 2nd congressional district. Among the newspaper's proprietors was Alexander W. Monroe, a prominent Romney lawyer who had previously served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates (1850‚Äì1851). Monroe and co-owner Job N. Cookus left the newspaper to serve in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Following the war, Monroe represented Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates (1875‚Äì1877 and 1879‚Äì1883). During the 1875‚Äì1877 legislative session, he was the Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. History A. S. Trowbridge founded the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser as a Democratic weekly newspaper in Romney in July 1850. Trowbridge had been an educator in New Orleans, Louisiana, before moving to Romney. The Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser newspaper billed itself as \\"A Family Newspaper‚ÄîDevoted to Politics, Agriculture, Education, General News, and Amusement.\\" By October 7, 1852, the Virginia Argus was being published by Trowbridge & Drinkard; on May 26, 1853, it reverted to being published by Trowbridge alone. After Trowbridge had edited and published the newspaper for seven years, its limited success did not meet his expectations, and in 1857 he sold the operation to Samuel R. Smith and John Joseph Combs. Alexander W. Monroe Smith and Combs operated the newspaper until 1858, when they sold it to James Parsons; he in turn sold it to his younger brother William Miller Parsons in 1859. After a few months of ownership and experience, Parsons sold the newspaper to Alexander W. Monroe, a prominent Romney lawyer and onetime member of the Virginia House of Delegates, and Job N. Cookus in 1861. Monroe and Cookus continued serving as the proprietors, editors, and publishers until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when they joined the Confederate States Army. The newspaper was closed by the Union Army in August 1861, and was not revived after the war. Following his service in the war, Monroe was elected to represent Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1875, during which time he served as the Speaker. He again represented Hampshire County in the House of Delegates from 1879 to 1883. He was the first delegate to represent Hampshire County in both the Virginia General Assembly and the West Virginia Legislature. The Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser had a circulation of 800 copies distributed per week, which was the second largest of the three newspapers published in Hampshire County; the other two were the South Branch Intelligencer of Romney, with a weekly circulation of 960 copies, and the Piedmont Independent of Piedmont (now in Mineral County, West Virginia), with a weekly circulation of 600 copies. The offices of the Virginia Argus were housed in an old stone edifice north of the Hampshire County Courthouse that had previously served as the home of the Romney Academy before its 1846 disestablishment. Jacob Green affair Charles James Faulkner In a series of articles published in the May 14 and 21, 1857 issues of the Virginia Argus, Romney resident Col. Isaac Parsons chronicled the 1855 arrest of his nephew, James Parsons, for attempting to capture Col. Parsons' fugitive slave, Jacob Green, and the resulting dispute between the Parsons family and Charles James Faulkner over legal fees in 1857. In August 1855, Green escaped from Parsons' Wappocomo plantation with four other slaves from neighboring plantations. In October of that year, he returned to Col. Parsons' plantation in Romney, and persuaded four or five slaves from neighboring farms owned by Parsons family relatives to escape with him to Pennsylvania. A party of eight to ten men, including Col. Parsons and two of his nephews, James Parsons and a Mr. Stump, went north in pursuit of the escapees. In the course of the pursuit, they captured two of Stump's escaped slaves, who were sent back to Hampshire County. With information obtained from the two recaptured slaves, Col. Parsons went to Johnstown, James Parsons to Hollidaysburg, and Stump to Altoona, where they hoped to intercept Green as he headed west on the Allegheny Portage Railroad and Main Line Canal toward Pittsburgh. James Parsons intercepted Green at Hollidaysburg, but local abolitionists thwarted his attempt to capture Green, and he was arrested and arraigned for kidnapping. John Randolph Tucker Upon learning of James Parsons' arrest, Col. Parsons sought the assistance of Charles James Faulkner, a prominent Martinsburg lawyer and United States House Representative from Virginia's 8th congressional district, and of James Murray Mason, a United States Senator from Virginia. Faulkner and Mason both offered their legal services for James Parsons' defense. The Virginia General Assembly pledged its support to Parsons and to Virginia's slaveowners in defending their constitutional rights and to protect them from prosecution. Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise appointed John Randolph Tucker to attend Parsons' trial as a \\"special commissioner\\" of Virginia. The dispute between Virginia and Pennsylvania escalated, and on January 31, 1856, an article published in the New York Herald read \\"Threatened Civil War between Virginia and Pennsylvania.\\" Col. Parsons, Faulkner, and Tucker traveled to Hollidaysburg for James Parsons' trial. Faulkner provided for Parsons' legal defense, leading to his acquittal as having acted legally under the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. In September 1856, Faulkner billed Col. Parsons $150 for his legal services. Parsons disputed the charge. In a series of articles in the Virginia Argus, he declared that Faulkner had originally offered his services at no cost; that he had been lauded publicly for his generosity in doing so without ever denying that he had been working pro bono; and that he was practicing \\"duplicity and deception\\" in trying to win a reputation in his district through \\"specious acts of munificence\\". Front page above the fold of the Virginia Argus published on April 30, 1857. This issue is archived at the Library of Virginia. Faulkner later served as United States Minister to France; following the American Civil War, he again served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, from West Virginia's 2nd congressional district. James Parsons and his brother William Miller Parsons were later proprietors of the Virginia Argus.

KQ Puppis (KQ Pup) is a spectroscopic binary variable star in the constellation Puppis. A red supergiant star and a hot main sequence star orbit each other every 9,742 days. Its apparent magnitude varies between 4.82 and 5.17. The KQ Puppis system consists of a fairly typical M2 supergiant, in orbit with a hotter less luminous star. The hotter star is surrounded by a disc of material being transferred from the cool supergiant. This type of binary is referred to a VV Cephei system, although in this case there are no eclipses of either star. A portion of the disc does appear to be eclipsed and this is detected as a strong drop in far-ultraviolet radiation for about a third of the orbit. The red supergiant primary star has been compared to Betelgeuse. It shows small amplitude irregular pulsations, and also some variation associated with the orbital motion. The nature of the secondary is less certain. The spectrum shows high excitation features that would indicate an early B or hotter spectral type, but these may be associated with the disc rather than that star itself. Other studies have found a spectrum similar to an A supergiant, but this is thought to be an artefact of a B-type shell star. KQ Puppis has been catalogued as an outlying member of the open cluster Messier 47 (NGC 2422) and would be the brightest member of that cluster. Membership is uncertain as it appears to be more distant than the other stars in the cluster.

Modeled on the Salon des Refus√©s, it is Denmark's oldest association of artists. Now located on Copenhagen's Oslo Plads next to √òsterport Station, it works as an arts centre, continuing to exhibit works created and selected by contemporary artists rather than those chosen by cultural authorities. History The organization was initiated by the painter Johan Rohde (1856‚Äì1935) and included several founding members: Jens Ferdinand Willumsen, Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, Vilhelm Hammersh√∏i, Johanne Cathrine Krebs the couple Harald and Agnes Slott- M√∏ller, Christian Mourier-Petersen and Malthe Engelsted. The first exhibition in 1891 presented 100 works by 18 artists, including Peder Severin Kr√∏yer, Julius Paulsen and Kristian Zahrtmann, who were among Denmark's greatest painters of the period.\\"Om Den Frie\\" , Den Frie Udstilling. Retrieved 30 January 2013. Den Frie at its present location at √òsterport photographed by Julius Aagaard In 1893, Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll designed a wooden pavilion for the association on a plot near City Hall Square in the very centre of Copenhagen. That year, international painters such as Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh exhibited works there. In 1898, Den Frie Udstilling moved to Aborreparken where a new pavilion inspired by Egyptian and Greek temples was designed by Willumsen who added an octagonal extension in 1905. As today, the facade was decorated with a relief of Pegasus, a symbol of freely inspired art drawn from Greek mythology. In 1913, the building was moved to its present location on Oslo Plads, maintaining sections of Willumsen's work. In 1915, disagreements among its members led to the establishment of Gr√∏nningen but Den Frie Udstilling has nevertheless maintained its central place in Danish art. Since 1950, exhibitors have included such famous names as Ole Schwalbe, Richard Mortensen, Ejler Bille and Wilhelm Freddie, Willy √òrskov, Hein Heinsen and Bj√∏rn N√∏rgaard.\\"Den Frie Udstilling\\", Den Store Danske.

Current exhibitions Entrance to Den Frie Udstillingsbygning Pegasus Den Frie Udstilling continues to exhibit contemporary art selected by the artists who are members of the association. As a result, the building hosts exhibitions of experimental art and related activities. The association's goal is to act as a platform for artistic divergence, reducing the gap between tradition and innovation. While a focus on artists' collectives and experimental groups is maintained, there are also exhibitions devoted to promising new artists or those who have made an important contribution to the history of art.\\"Den Frie Udstillingsbygning\\", KulturKlik.

The force was never fully operational as the country constantly fought for its survival with the neighboring Soviet Russia. Eventually most of the Black Fleet was either sunk by the Bolsheviks or become part of expeditionary force of the White movement on evacuation. History =Early history= The first naval activities in the area now known as Ukraine date back to the late Middle Ages, when Zaporizhian Host Cossacks conducted raids in the Lower Dnieper, Southern Buh rivers and the Black Sea against Ottoman Empire. Cossacks were using chaikas (—á–∞–π–∫–∞)Serhiy Kharchenko, The Ukrainian Navy Chronological Discrepancy, The Ukrainian Observer, Issue 200\\\\- light vessels propelled by sail and rowing, and armed with light hand held cannons. By a simple but genius technology, chaika could be transformed into a makeshift shallow-waters submarine used for reconnaissance and surprise landings. Due to the fact that the Zaporizhian Host had no direct access to the Black Sea those boats were light enough and small enough to navigate them through the rapids-filled Dnieper river. Nonetheless cossack's sea raids delivered huge blows to Ottoman coast cities, including capital port city of Constantinople/Istanbul as well as Samsun and Sinop (utmost northern port of Asia Minor). One of the most notorious naval commanders was Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny. However, Cossacks never established permanent sea ports due to lack of various tactical and financial means. =1917‚Äì1921= Medal of Ukrainian fleet of April 29, 1918. Gunboat \\"Donets\\" of Ukrainian Naval Forces, July‚ÄìNovember 1918 Ukrainian marines in 1921 Ukrainian warships in the port of Sevastopol, 1918 During 1917 Russian Revolution, several ships of the Russian Imperial Navy's Black Sea Fleet, commanded and crewed by ethnic Ukrainians, declared themselves the Navy of the newly autonomous Ukrainian People's Republic Black Sea Fleet commander Mikhail Sablin raised the colours of the Ukrainian National Republic on 29 April 1918.Operation Fleet For Ukraine, The Ukrainian Week (16 May 2011) Crimean campaign of Peter Bolbochan in 1918, Radio Free Europe (April 2018) However, few further steps on establishing a navy were made as the Ukrainian government lost control over coastal territories. After the Revolution 1917, a time of anarchy and demoralization overtook the former Russian Black Sea Fleet. The Fleet, stationed in Sevastopol, was commanded by a collective, \\"Tsentroflot\\". Different political influences clashed: Ukrainian, Bolshevik, Menshevik, Social Revolutionaries and Anarchist. Very different flags were hoisted over ships: Ukrainian bicolors, old Russian ensigns, Bolshevist red flags and Anarchist black flags.Ukraine - Historical Naval Flags (1918), accessed October 2009 They were hoisted and lowered even several times daily, according to changes of each crew's political orientation. The Ukrainian People's Republic aspired to take control of the Fleet. On 22 December 1917 the Naval Ministry in Kiev was established. Starting October 1917 the crews of the ships established military councils; the blue-yellow flags were flying from the masts. The ships Zavidniy (Enviable) and Russian cruiser Pamiat Merkuria (1907) were the first examples. The General Secretariat for Naval Affairs was established within the government of the Central Rada in Kiev (in January 1918 it was reformed in a Ministry). The head of it became D. Antonovich. The Main Navy Staff was led by Captain Jerzy ≈öwirski. For the educational and agitational purposes of the seamen the Central Rada seconded the commissars to Odessa, Nikolaev, Kherson and Sevastopol. November 22, 1917 the whole crew of the newest and most powerful warship of the Black Sea Fleet Volya swore fealty to the Central Rada, followed soon by several ships and submarines. On 29 April 1918, Rear-admiral M. Sablin was appointed commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Navy. A telegram to Kiev was sent from the staff ship Georgiy Pobedonosets ‚ÄúEffective today the Sevastopol fortress and the Fleet in Sevastopol raised the Ukrainian flag. Admiral Sablin assumed the command of the Fleet‚Äù. Having no reply the admiral ordered to repeat the telegram beginning with the words ‚ÄúComrades of Kiev Central Rada...‚Äù. But Sablin was unaware that at that moment the Central Rada in Kiev was already history. Ukraine had a navy for five months. From October 1917 till March 1918 the following came to be at the disposal of the Ukrainians: nine battleships, seven cruisers, 18 destroyers, 14 submarines, 16 patrol ships and avisos, 11 military transports and mother ships. Additionally, the Fleet‚Äôs Headquarters, all military institutions and plants, all coastal fortifications were in hands of the Ukrainians. But they were yet to face a disaster. The Kaiser‚Äôs forces had been advancing on Sevastopol with a goal to capture the Black Sea Fleet. Having no support from the land forces, Admiral Sablin was forced enter negotiations regarding cessation of hostilities. The Germans however rejected the armistice proposals and the advance continued. In April 1918 German and Ukrainian troops invaded Crimea. On 29 April 1918, fleet-commanding Rear- admiral Sablin (Russian) gave an order to hoist Ukrainian national flags over all ships in Sevastopol (the medal to the right commemorates that event). But Germans started to occupy Sevastopol, because the bolsheviks began to lead away ships. Centroflot (the combined fleet revolutionary committee), in order to save the Fleet, took a decision to move it to Novorossiysk. But on April 30, 1918, only the small part of the fleet under command of Admiral Sablin, which trusted the bolsheviks, headed for Novorossiysk and hoisted Russian St. Andrew (saltire) ensigns. The greater part of the Ukrainian fleet remained in Sevastopol - there were 30 destroyers and torpedo boats, 25 auxiliaries, 7 battleships and small craft as well as 15 submarines left in Sevastopol under Admiral Myhaylo Ostrogradskiy who in this situation assumed command. On 1 May 1918 Germans captured the ships remaining in Sevastopol, because the actions of Bolsheviks violated the peace agreement. On 17 June 1918, 1 dreadnought and 6 destroyers returned from Novorossiysk to Sevastopol, where they were also captured. The greater part of the ships remaining in Novorossiysk were destroyed by their own crews on Lenin's command. In July‚ÄìNovember 1918 Germans gradually transferred many ships to the command of Ukrainian government (Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi). The main Ukrainian sea power concentrated in Odessa and Nikolayev was more than 20 minesweepers, 7 small cruisers, 1 dreadnought and more than 30 auxiliaries. In Sevastopol there were only 2 old battleships under Ukrainian flags. On 18 July 1918 the Naval Ministry in Kiev established new naval ensigns and some rank flags (e.g. flag of Naval Minister, flag of Deputy Minister). The old Russian jack remained as Ukrainian naval jack. It was regarded as symbol of glory of Black Sea Fleet, whose crews were in large part previously Ukrainian. On 17 September Germans gives Ukraine 17 U-boats. In December 1918, when naval forces of the Entente were approaching Sevastopol, Ukrainian Rear-admiral V. Klokhkovskyy (–í'—è—á–µ—Å–ª–∞–≤ –ö–ª–æ—á–∫–æ–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π) commanded all ships to hoist Russian St. Andrew (saltire) ensigns. It was a demonstration of good intentions for the Entente. However, the Entente captured the Black Sea Fleet and subsequently transferred it to the Russian \\"White\\" forces. In Ukrainian hands remained only small in numbers subdivisions of marines. Ukrainian naval authorities existed until 1921.

In November 1917 in Sevastopol was established the Sahaidachny Sea Battalion (kurin) which on November 24, 1917 was sent to Kiev to extinguish Bolshevik uprisings and participated in the Kiev Arsenal January Uprising. On December 29, 1917 most of the Black Sea Fleet was taken over by Bolsheviks. Earlier in December 1917 the Black Seas Fleet squadron under Ukrainian flags led by the Russian battleship Imperator Aleksandr III and included another cruiser and three destroyers participated in the evacuation of the 127th Infantry Division from Trebizond back to Ukraine. =Baltic Fleet= * Soviet cruiser Krasnyi Krym (October 12, 1917) * Russian destroyer Ukraina (October 12, 1917) * Russian destroyer Haidamak (October 12, 1917) =Black Sea Fleet= * Russian battleship Georgii Pobedonosets (November 9, 1917) * Russian cruiser Pamiat Merkuria (1907) (November 12, 1917) * Russian destroyer Zorkiy (November 12, 1917) * Russian destroyer Zvonkiy (November 12, 1917) * Russian Battleship Volya (previously Imperator Aleksandr III) (November 22, 1917) * Russian battleship Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya Legacy On 29 April 2018 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman greeted Ukrainian Navy personnel on the 100th anniversary since the foundation of Ukraine's Navy.Ukraine marks 100th anniversary of Ukraine's Navy, UNIAN (29 April 2018) The Black Sea Fleet raised the colours of the Ukrainian National Republic on 29 April 1918.

According to a March 2011 statement by the collective members, \\"Our efforts from the beginning have been to extract ourselves from the ownership situation and focus on our core mission: making quality radio and building a supportive community. That is what we are focusing on now.\\" They stated their plan is to work \\"more democratically.\\" This reformation initially consisted of putting podcasts up on the website Ustream to maintain radio operations and keep the community intact. DJs continued to work from the former cafe. The full relaunch was ready by the end of May, with Programming Director Aaron Lazenby stating that they were \\"tired of living in the wake of that drama\\" and adding that \\"we‚Äôre ready to be something else.\\" There was a closing ceremony on May 31, 2011, hosted by DJ Nylon. Mutiny Radio Relaunches as an Internet-Based Station On June 1, 2011, the station was relaunched as Mutiny Radio, a name chosen to reflect \\"the right balance of where we‚Äôve come from and where we‚Äôre going,\\" according to Lazenby, which \\"showed the scars\\" of the past, but also expressed their new future. According to the website, the Mutiny Radio live stream \\"features the same eclectic mix of live music, interviews, DJ performances, news, and comedy the members of the collective have been producing for the past 6 years.\\" Unlike its predecessor's illegal broadcast, Mutiny Radio is an online-only radio station. In 2012, the station successfully raised over $5,000 through a Kickstarter campaign to be used for rent and other expenses to keep the station operating. Local Participation, Protest, Activism and Journalism Past coverage of local events has included Occupy Wall Street West protests, live screenings of the 2012 Presidential Debates in affinity with Occupy the Debates, participation in the Phono del Sol Music and Food Festival, and an annual Block Party in cooperation with the Box Factory and other local businesses. Monthly broadcast events are coordinated with local bar Asiento and Oakland Art Murmur. Mutiny Radio also took part in San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee's honoring of the 50th anniversary of Tony Bennett's recording \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\" with other stations across the city. Musical Guests Guests have ranged from musicians such as George Clinton, Jane Wiedlin, Mary Wilson, Micky Dolenz, Toots and the Maytals, Roky Erickson and punk rocker Meri St. Mary to a variety of local bands. The band Monkey appeared on the show Afternoon Delight in 2017. Awards Merry Toppins and Vaperonica Dee's weekly podcast Cannabis Cuts won \\"Best Smoke on the Air\\" from San Francisco Bay Guardian's Best of the Bay 2012.

The 2019 Comedy Festival was covered in the San Francisco Examiner. Financial Troubles In 2015, scalpers took advantage of a Mutiny Radio free ticket giveaway and attempted to resell tickets on Craigslist using the station's name without permission, harming the station's reputation with music venues. In July 2019, a video went viral of host Capital Pilcrow being punched by an audience member, who proceeded to destroy the door window on the way out. Like many small businesses and community organizations, Mutiny Radio has been adversely affected by the Coronovirus-19 Pandemic. Director Benjamin has produced outdoor comedy shows for the Mission since May 2020 to mixed reception. By June, the shows were limited to clean humor only. Benjamin continues to rely on GoFundMe and Venmo donations to fund the station's increasing rent and operating costs. As of July, $7000 had been raised for rent and maintenance, funding the station for an additional two months of quarantined operation.

The dance recounts the story of hunting or war parties searching for the enemy. Origins The Straight Dance is attributed to the Southern Plains tribes in Oklahoma. The Hethuska, a prominent war society of the Poncas, is commonly attributed with the creation of the dance; however, the Pawnee, Omaha, Osage, and Kiowa tribes have sometimes been credited with creating the dance. In the 20th century, when several warrior societies began to dissolve, the purpose of the war dances changed. The Straight Dance evolved from these war dances as a way to keep the tradition and history. Description Two Straight dancers wearing otter draggers The Straight Dance is considered to be more dignified or formal than other pow wow dances. The general steps for the dance involve a \\"toe-heel\\" step where the dancer taps the ground with his toe on the first drum beat and then places his whole foot down on the second beat. The dance resembles a hunting or warring party and therefore the dancer must not dance backwards as that would symbolize a retreat from the enemy. Instead they always dance clockwise around the circle. As a Southern dance, it is danced to a Southern Drum. The Straight Dance regalia consists of a ribbon shirt, tab leggings, aprons, and a headdress (usually a roach or a turban). These are decorated and accessorized with finger-woven garters, beaded belts, vests or bandoliers, German silver armbands, and scarfs. One of the main features of the Straight Dance is an otter dragger, also referred as an otterhide, which hangs from the dancer's back and drags on the ground. It is normally decorated with medals, beadwork, ribbonwork, or feathers. Straight dancers generally carry a fan, mirror board, or tail stick in their hands.

She set both an Australian record and her personal best time of 9:18.35, by finishing third in the women's 3000 metres steeplechase at the 2008 IAAF Golden League Meeting in Oslo, Norway. Career Early in her career, MacFarlane won the Australian Under 20 titles over 800m, 1500m and cross country. In 2000, she won the senior bronze medal in the 3000m steeplechase at the Australian Athletics Championships, in the event's inaugural year for women. She struggled to improve her best times in her early twenties, however, and retired from athletics to focus on her career as a journalist. Five years later - married and with two children, MacFarlane resumed running as a personal goal to get fit and enter a fun run in Hobart, Tasmania. Under new coach, Max Cherry, MacFarlane competed for the Sandy Bay Harriers Club - improving her best times over every distance from 400m to 10 km. One year after getting back into running, MacFarlane won a bronze medal in the 3000m steeplechase at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Immediately following the Commonwealth Games, she helped Australia to a team bronze medal in the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. After a very successful international racing schedule, tragedy struck at the 2007 World Athletics Championships in Osaka, Japan. The Chinese competitor accidentally caused MacFarlane's shoe to come off, which ultimately caused her to withdraw from the race due to severe blistering and injury to her foot. MacFarlane returned to world-class form in 2008, but a few months before the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, her coach, Max Cherry died at the age of 81. MacFarlane represented Australia at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where she competed in the first ever women's 3000 m steeplechase, along with her teammate Victoria Mitchell. She ran ninth in the third heat against fifteen other athletes, including Kenya's Eunice Jepkorir and Russia's Yekaterina Volkova, who both later won the silver and bronze medals in the final, respectively.

The set of Q-Thrusters has as subsets RF resonant cavity thrusters and Mach Lorentz thrusters A diagram illustrating the theory of Q thruster operation A quantum vacuum thruster (QVT or Q-thruster) is a theoretical system hypothesized to use the same principles and equations of motion that a conventional plasma thruster would use, namely magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), to make predictions about the behavior of the propellant. However, rather than using a conventional plasma as a propellant, a QVT would interact with quantum vacuum fluctuations of the zero-point field. The concept is controversial and generally not considered physically possible. However, if QVT systems were possible they could eliminate the need to carry propellant, being limited only by the availability of energy.  History and controversy  The name and concept is controversial. In 2008, Yu Zhu and others at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University claimed to measure thrust from such a thruster, but called it a \\"microwave thruster without propellant\\" working on quantum principles. In 2011 it was mentioned as something to be studied by Harold G. White and his team at NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories, who were working with a prototype of such a thruster. Other physicists, such as Sean M. Carroll and John Baez, dismiss it because the quantum vacuum as currently understood is not a plasma and does not possess plasma-like characteristics. Theory of operation NASA Eagleworks A vacuum can be viewed not as empty space but as the combination of all zero-point fields. According to quantum field theory the universe is made up of matter fields whose quanta are fermions (e.g. electrons and quarks) and force fields, whose quanta are bosons (i.e. photons and gluons). All these fields have some intrinsic zero-point energy. Describing the quantum vacuum, a Physics Today article cited by White's team describes this ensemble of fields as \\"a turbulent sea, roiling with waves associated with a panoply of force-mediating fields such as the photon and Higgs fields\\". Given the equivalence of mass and energy expressed by Albert Einstein's E = mc2, any point in space that contains energy can be thought of as having mass to create particles. Virtual particles spontaneously flash into existence and annihilate each other at every point in space due to the energy of quantum fluctuations. Many real physical effects attributed to these vacuum fluctuations have been experimentally verified, such as spontaneous emission, Casimir force, Lamb shift, magnetic moment of the electron and Delbr√ºck scattering; these effects are usually called \\"radiative corrections\\". Casimir forces on parallel plates due to vacuum fluctuations The Casimir effect is a weak force between two uncharged conductive plates caused by the zero-point energy of the vacuum. It was first observed experimentally by Lamoreaux (1997) and results showing the force have been repeatedly replicated. Several scientists including White have highlighted that a net thrust can indeed be induced on a spacecraft via the related \\"dynamical Casimir effect\\". The dynamic Casimir effect was observed experimentally for the first time in 2011 by Wilson et al. In the dynamical Casimir effect electromagnetic radiation is emitted when a mirror is accelerated at extremely high rates. When the speed of the mirror begins to match the speed of the photons, some photons become separated from their virtual pair and so do not get annihilated. Virtual photons become real and the mirror begins to produce light. This is an example of Unruh radiation. A publication by Feigel (2004) raised the possibility of a Casimir-like effect that transfers momentum from zero-point quantum fluctuations to matter, controlled by applied electric and magnetic fields. These results were debated in a number of follow up papers in particular van Tiggelen et al. (2006) found no momentum transfer for homogeneous fields, but predict a very small transfer for a Casimir-like field geometry. This cumulated with Birkeland & Brevik (2007) who showed that electromagnetic vacuum fields can cause broken symmetries (anisotropy) in the transfer of momentum or, put another way, that the extraction of momentum from electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations is possible in an analogous way that the extraction of energy is possible from the Casimir effect. Birkeland & Brevik highlight that momentum asymmetries exist throughout nature and that the artificial stimulation of these by electric and magnetic fields have already been experimentally observed in complex liquids. This relates to the Abraham‚ÄìMinkowski controversy, a long theoretical and experimental debate that continues to the current time. It is widely recognized that this controversy is an argument about definition of the interaction between matter and fields. It has been argued that momentum transfer between matter and electromagnetic fields relating to the Abraham-Minikowski issue would allow for propellant- less drives. A QVT system seeks to make use of this predicted Casimir-like momentum transfer. It is argued that when the vacuum is exposed to crossed electric and magnetic fields (i.e. E and B-fields), it will induce a drift of the entire vacuum plasma which is orthogonal to that of the applied E x B fields. In a 2015 paper White highlighted that the presence of ordinary matter is predicted to cause an energy perturbation in the surrounding quantum vacuum such that the local vacuum state has a different energy density when compared with the \\"empty\\" cosmological vacuum energy state. This suggests the possibility of modelling the vacuum as a dynamic entity as opposed to it being an immutable and non-degradable state. White models of the perturbed quantum vacuum around a hydrogen atom as a Dirac vacuum consisting of virtual electron-positron pairs. Given the nontrivial variability in local energy densities resulting from virtual pair production, he suggests the tools of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can be used to model the quasiclassical behavior of the quantum vacuum as a plasma. White compares changes in vacuum energy density induced by matter to the hypothetical chameleon field or quintessence currently being discussed in the scientific literature. It is claimed the existence of a ‚Äúchameleon‚Äù field whose mass is dependent on the local matter density may be an explanation for dark energy. A number of notable physicists, such as Sean Carroll, see the idea of a dynamical vacuum energy as the simplest and best explanation for dark energy. Evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's equivalence principle and variation of the fundamental constants ideas which are due to be tested by the Euclid telescope which is set to launch in 2020. Systems utilizing Casimir effects have thus far been shown to only create very small forces and are generally considered one-shot devices that would require a subsequent energy to recharge them (i.e. Forward's \\"vacuum fluctuation battery\\"). The ability of systems to use the zero-point field continuously as a source of energy or propellant is much more contentious (though peer-reviewed models have been proposed). There is debate over which formalisms of quantum mechanics apply to propulsion physics under such circumstances, the more refined Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), or the relatively undeveloped and controversial Stochastical Quantum Electrodynamics (SED). SED describes electromagnetic energy at absolute zero as a stochastic, fluctuating zero-point field. In SED the motion of a particle immersed in the stochastic zero-point radiation field generally results in highly nonlinear behaviour. Quantum effects emerge as a result of permanent matter-field interactions not possible to describe in QED The typical mathematical models used in classical electromagnetism, quantum electrodynamics (QED) and the standard model view electromagnetism as a U(1) gauge theory, which topologically restricts any complex nonlinear interaction. The electromagnetic vacuum in these theories is generally viewed as a linear system with no overall observable consequence. For many practical calculations zero-point energy is dismissed by fiat in the mathematical model as a constant that may be canceled or as a term that has no physical effect. The 2016 paper by White highlights that stochastic electrodynamics (SED) allows for a pilot-wave interpretation of quantum mechanics. Pilot-wave interpretations of quantum mechanics are a family of deterministic nonlocal theories distinct from other more mainstream interpretations such as the Copenhagen interpretation and Everett's many-worlds interpretation. Pioneering experiments by Couder and Fort beginning in 2006 have shown that macroscopic classical pilot-waves can exhibit characteristics previously thought to be restricted to the quantum realm. Hydrodynamic pilot-wave analogs have been able to duplicate the double slit experiment, tunneling, quantized orbits, and numerous other quantum phenomena and as such pilot-wave theories are experiencing a resurgence in interest. Coulder and Fort note in their 2006 paper that pilot-waves are nonlinear dissipative systems sustained by external forces. A dissipative system is characterized by the spontaneous appearance of symmetry breaking (anisotropy) and the formation of complex, sometimes chaotic or emergent, dynamics where interacting fields can exhibit long range correlations. In SED the zero point field (ZPF) plays the role of the pilot wave that guides real particles on their way. Modern approaches to SED consider wave and particle- like quantum effects as well-coordinated emergent systems that are the result of speculated sub-quantum interactions with the zero-point field = Controversy and criticism = Some notable physicists have found the Q-thruster concept to be implausible. For example, mathematical physicist John Baez has criticized the reference to \\"quantum vacuum virtual plasma\\" noting that: \\"There's no such thing as 'virtual plasma' \\".https://plus.google.com/117663015413546257905/posts/WfFtJ8bYVya Noted Caltech theoretical physicist Sean M. Carroll has also affirmed this statement, writing \\"[t]here is no such thing as a ‚Äòquantum vacuum virtual plasma,‚Äô...\\".http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/08/06/nasa- validate-imposible-space-drive-word/#.VCYphStdU3c In addition, Lafleur found that quantum field theory predicts no net force, implying that the measured thrusts are unlikely to be due to quantum effects. However, Lafleur noted that this conclusion was based on the assumption that the electric and magnetic fields were homogeneous, whereas certain theories posit a small net force in inhomogeneous vacuums. Notably, the violation of energy and momentum conservation laws have been heavily criticized. In a presentation at NASA's Ames Research Center in November 2014, White addressed the issue of conservation of momentum by stating that the Q-thruster conserves momentum by creating a wake or anisotropic state in the quantum vacuum. White indicated that once false positives were ruled out, Eagleworks would explore the momentum distribution and divergence angle of the quantum vacuum wake using a second Q-thruster to measure the quantum vacuum wake.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wokn7crjBbA In a paper published in January 2014, White proposed to address the conservation of momentum issue by stating that the Q-thruster pushes quantum particles (electrons/positrons) in one direction, whereas the Q-thruster recoils to conserve momentum in the other direction. White stated that this principle was similar to how a submarine uses its propeller to push water in one direction, while the submarine recoils to conserve momentum.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140013174.pdf Hence, the violations of fundamental laws of physics can be avoided. = Other hypothesized quantum vacuum thrusters = A number of physicists have suggested that a spacecraft or object may generate thrust through its interaction with the quantum vacuum. For example, Fabrizio Pinto in a 2006 paper published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society noted it may be possible to bring a cluster of polarisable vacuum particles to a hover in the laboratory and then to transfer thrust to a macroscopic accelerating vehicle. Similarly, Jordan Maclay in a 2004 paper titled \\"A Gedanken Spacecraft that Operates Using the Quantum Vacuum (Dynamic Casimir Effect)\\" published in the scientific journal Foundations of Physics noted that it is possible to accelerate a spacecraft based on the dynamic Casimir effect, in which electromagnetic radiation is emitted when an uncharged mirror is properly accelerated in vacuum. Similarly, Puthoff noted in a 2010 paper titled \\"Engineering the Zero-Point Field and Polarizable Vacuum For Interstellar Flight\\" published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society noted that it may be possible that the quantum vacuum might be manipulated so as to provide energy/thrust for future space vehicles. Likewise, researcher Yoshinari Minami in a 2008 paper titled \\"Preliminary Theoretical Considerations for Getting Thrust via Squeezed Vacuum\\" published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society noted the theoretical possibility of extracting thrust from the excited vacuum induced by controlling squeezed light. In addition, Alexander Feigel in a 2009 paper noted that propulsion in quantum vacuum may be achieved by rotating or aggregating magneto-electric nano-particles in strong perpendicular electrical and magnetic fields. However, according to Puthoff, although this method can produce angular momentum causing a static disk (known as a Feynman disk) to begin to rotate, it cannot induce linear momentum due to a phenomenon known as \\"hidden momentum\\" that cancels the ability of the proposed E√óB propulsion method to generate linear momentum. However, some recent experimental and theoretical work by van Tiggelen and colleagues suggests that linear momentum may be transferred from the quantum vacuum in the presence of an external magnetic field.  Experiments  In 2013, the Eagleworks team tested a device called the Serrano Field Effect Thruster, built by Gravitec Inc. at the request of Boeing and DARPA. The Eagleworks team has theorized that this device is a Q-thruster. The thruster consists of a set of circular dielectrics sandwiched between electrodes; its inventor describes it device as producing thrust through a preselected shaping of an electric field. Gravitec Inc. alleges that in 2011 they tested the \\"asymmetrical capacitor\\" device in a high vacuum several times and have ruled out ion wind or electrostatic forces as an explanation for the thrust produced. In February through June 2013, the Eagleworks team evaluated the SFE test article in and out of a Faraday Shield and at various vacuum conditions. Thrust was observed in the ~1‚Äì20 N/kW range. The magnitude of the thrust scaled approximately with the cube of the input voltage (20‚Äì110 ŒºN). As of 2015, the researchers have not published a peer- reviewed paper detailing the results of this experiment. Using a torsion pendulum, White's team claimed to have measured 30‚Äì50 ŒºN of thrust from a microwave cavity resonator designed by Guido Fetta in an attempt at propellant-less propulsion. Using the same measurement equipment, a non-zero force was also measured on a \\"null\\" resonator that was not designed to experience any such force, which they suggest hints at \\"interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma\\". All measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure, presumably in contact with air, and with no analysis of systematic errors, except for the use of an RF load without the resonant cavity interior as a control device. In early 2015, Paul March from that team made new results public, claiming positive experimental force measurements with a torsional pendulum in a hard vacuum: about 50 ¬µN with 50 W of input power at 5.0√ó10‚àí6 torr, and new null-thrust tests. The claims of the team have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, only as a conference paper in 2013. Yu Zhu and Juan Yang previously claimed to have measured anomalous thrust arising from a similar device, using power levels roughly 100 times greater, and measuring thrust roughly 1000 times greater. A followup paper later identified the source of that anomalous thrust as experimental error.Yang, J.; Liu, X.-C.; Wang, Y.-G.; Tang, M.-J.; Luo, L.-T.; Jin, Y.-Z.; Ning, Z.-X. (February 2016). \\"Thrust Measurement of an Independent Microwave Thruster Propulsion Device with Three-Wire Torsion Pendulum Thrust Measurement System\\". Journal of Propulsion Technology(in Chinese). 37 (2): 362‚Äì371. = Current experiments = The 2006 Woodward effect test article Plot diagram of the 2006 Woodward effect test results In 2015, Eagleworks attempted to gather performance data to support the development of a Q-thruster engineering prototype for reaction- control-system applications in the force range of 0.1‚Äì1 N with a corresponding input electrical power range of 0.3‚Äì3 kW. The group planned to begin by testing a refurbished test article to improve the historical performance of a 2006 experiment that attempted to demonstrate the Woodward effect. The photograph shows the test article and the plot diagram shows the thrust trace from a 500g load cell in experiments performed in 2006. The group hoped that testing the device on a high-fidelity torsion pendulum (1‚Äì4 ŒºN at 10‚Äì40 W) will unambiguously demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, perhaps via an on-orbit detailed test objective (DTO) to test operation in outer space.

It is the third largest city in Kerala and the headquarters of Kozhikode district. Kozhikode was dubbed the \\"City of Spices\\" for its role as the major trading point of eastern spices during the Middle ages and probably as early as Classical antiquity. Kozhikode was once the capital of an independent kingdom by the same name and later of the erstwhile Malabar District. Foundation Calicut, India from Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg's atlas Civitates orbis terrarum, 1572 During the Sangam period (3rd4thcenturyBC), the land where Kozhikode now stands was an uninhabited region of the Chera Empire. This land, part of the larger Tamilakam partly fell within the Kudanad (Western land; west of Kongunad) to the south and partly within Puzhinad (marshy tract) to the north. The dominion of the Cheras extended as far as present-day Vatakara, beyond which lay the kingdom of Eli (Ezhi). The ports of the Chera empire played an important role in fostering trade relations between Kerala and the outside world. According to scholars, Tyndis or Tondi (present-day Kadalundi or Ponnani) to the south of Kozhikode was a flourishing seaport. During the 9th century, this region became a part of the Second Chera Empire. The Cheras (also known as Perumals) ruled the territory until 1102. The rise of Calicut as a major trading centre and a port city does not seem to have happened before the 13th century. While the first reference to the Kingdom of Calicut and Saamoothiri is made by Ibn Battuta in his accounts (1342‚Äì1347), there is no reference to Calicut by Marco Polo, who visited Kerala towards the end of the 13th Century. He does, however, mention the kingdom of Eli. This provides a clue to a plausible date for the rise of Calicut as a major kingdom on the Kerala coast. Nevertheless, Prof. Krishna Ayyar has assigned 1034CE as the year of the foundation of the city.Ayyar, K.V. Krishna, The Zamorins of Calicut- From the Earliest Times to A.D.1806(1938), Calicut. According to the Keralolpathi (Genesis of Kerala), the last of the Chera kings, Cheraman Perumal, partitioned the kingdom among his feudatories and secretly left for Mecca with some Arab traders where he embraced Islam and lived the rest of his life in obscurity in Arabia. The date of this partition is a significant turning point in the history of Kerala. It is now clear that the Cheraman Perumals ruled in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries and that the last Cheraman Perumal was Rama Varma Kulasekhara (1089‚Äì1102). Although there is no basis for the last Perumal's conversion to Islam and pilgrimage to Mecca, it is now accepted that following his mysterious disappearance the land was partitioned and that the governors of different Nadus (fiefdoms) gained independence, proclaiming it as their 'gift' from the last sovereign.M.G.S. Narayanan,Calicut: The City of Truth(2006) Calicut University Publications There is some ambiguity regarding the exact course of events that led to the establishment of the zamorin's rule over Calicut. According to Prof. A. Sreedhara Menon (who entirely rejects the story of Cheraman Perumal's disappearance, his conversion to Islam and the subsequent gifts to his feudatories), immediately following the 'fall' of the Rama Kulasekhara, Calicut and its suburbs formed part of the Polanad Kingdom ruled by the Porlatiri.Sreedhara Menon.A,A Survey of Kerala History(1967),p.152. D.C.Books Kottayam The Eradis of Nediyirippu in Ernad (somewhere around present Kondotty) were land-locked and sought an outlet to the sea to initiate trade and commerce with distant lands.BhƒÅratƒ´ya sthalanƒÅma patrikƒÅ (page 44) published by Place Names Society of India To accomplish this, the Eradis marched with their nairs towards Panniyankara and besieged the Porlatiri in his headquarters, resulting in a 50-year war. The Eradis emerged victorious in their conquest of Polanad. After this, Menokkis were made as the ruler of Polanad and came to terms with the troops and people. After this, the town of Calicut was founded close to the palace at Tali. Then, the Eradis shifted their headquarters from Nediyirippu to Calicut. The Governor of Ernad built a fort at a place called Velapuram to safeguard his new interests. The fort most likely lent its name to Koyil Kotta the precursor to Calicut. Zheng He's navigation chart from Hormuz to Calicut, 1430 However, M.G.S. Narayanan in his book, Calicut: The City of Truth states that the Governor of Eranad, Mana Vikrama (who became the Zamorin of Calicut later) was, in fact, a favourite of the last Ceraman Perumal, Rama Kulasekara as the former was at the forefront of the wars with the Chola-Pandya forces to the South and led the army to victory. The King, therefore, granted him, as a mark of favour, a small tract of land on the sea-coast in addition to his hereditary possessions. This patch of wasteland is called Cullikkad in the Keralolpathi. To corroborate his assertion that Mana Vikrama was, in fact, a favourite of the last Perumal, Narayanan cites a stone inscription of the last ruler (1102) discovered at Kollam in South Kerala. It refers to Nalu taliyum ayiram arunurruvarum eranadu vazhkai Manavikiraman mutalayulla camantarum-'The four Councillors, The Thousand, The Six Hundred, along with Mana Vikrama, the Governor of Eranad and other Feudatories'. However, the Eradis being land- locked lacked direct access to the coastline as the territory of Polanad (Porakilanad) lay between Eranad and Calicut. Having been given the royal sword and the injunction Cattum konnum adakki kolka (conquer by courting and conferring death) by the last Ceraman (according to Keralolpathi), the Ernad Utayavar (Governor) waged war against the Porlatiri (Porakilar Adhikari) and attacked Panniyankara. M.G.S seems to indicate that the land sought by the Ernadis, lay in fact beyond and not within the kingdom of Polanad. With the conquest of Polanad, the status of the Utayavar (Governor) increased and he came to be known as Swami Nambiyathiri Thirumulpad and the Kingdom of Calicut also came to known as Nediyiruppu Swarupam after the original house of the Eradis at Nediyiruppu. The king's title gradually evolved into Samoothirippadu or Saamoothiri or Saamoori over the years. The Europeans called him Zamorin. The foundation of the city of Calicut was therefore laid during the initial years of the 12th century. The history of Kozhikode can roughly be divided into several periods marked by a few epoch-making events. These include the city's establishment, the arrival of the Portuguese, the arrival of the Dutch, the Mysorean Invasion, the rise of British Power, the beginning of the Indian Independence Movement and finally freedom from British rule in 1947 Arrival of the Portuguese The Zamorin of Calicut as portrayed by the Dutch This single event marked an epoch in the history of Kerala and India, not because Vasco da Gama 'discovered the sea route to India' as is in the common parlance (since the Chinese, the Middle East and the African kingdoms already traded directly with India) but unlike the others, the Portuguese yearned for political power and imperial domination. Vasco da Gama's fame is more often argued as due to historical reasons for which he was hardly responsiblePanickar.K.M, A History of Kerala(1959) Annamalai University in that he was accompanied by a Portuguese-speaking Arab merchant provided by the Sultan of Melinda in East Africa. Vasco da Gama was sent by the King of Portugal Dom Manuel I and landed in Calicut at Kappad in 17 May 1498. The navigator was received with traditional hospitality, but an interview with the Zamorin failed to produce any concrete results. Vasco da Gama's request for permission to leave a factor behind him in charge of the merchandise he could not sell was turned down by the King, who insisted that da Gama pay customs duty like any other trader, straining the relationship between the two. The next expedition was sent by the King of Portugal under the leadership of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral in 1500. His agent secured a settlement to erect a factory at Calicut. This, however, precipitated matters between the Arabs and the Portuguese. The Portuguese capture of Arab vessels and ensuing massacre was retaliated by the locals who burned down the factory and butchered half of the Portuguese on land. Cabral sailed for Cochin, where he was cordially received and allowed to load his ships. Vasco da Gama reached Calicut the second time with 15 ships and 800 men in February 1502. When da Gama's call to expel all Muslims from Calicut was vehemently turned down, he bombarded the city and captured several rice vessels, cutting off the crew's hands, ears and noses. With rising bonhomie between the Maharaja of Cochin and the Portuguese, there followed several wars in which the Portuguese propped up Cochin and Cannanore against the Zamorin. Scores of men perished in these wars on all sides starting in 1503 and continuing till the early 1570s. In the year 1509, Afonso de Albuquerque was appointed the second Viceroy of the Portuguese possessions in the East. A new fleet under Marshall Coutinho arrived with specific instructions to destroy the power of Calicut. The Zamorin's palace was captured and destroyed and the city was set on fire. But the King's forces rallied fast to kill Marshall Coutinho and wounded Albuquerque. Albuquerque nevertheless was clever enough to patch up his quarrel and entered into a treaty with the Zamorin in 1513 to protect Portuguese interests in Kerala. Hostilities were renewed when the Portuguese attempted to assassinate the Zamorin sometime between 1515 and 1518. From the 1520s the Zamorin's naval fleet was administered by the Kunjali Marakkars who inflicted heavy damages to Portuguese property till 1589. King Zamorin was assisted mainly by four ministers namely Mangatachan the Chief Minister, Dharmoth Panicker, Army Chief and Teacher of Martial Arts, Kuthiravatathu Nair, Finance Minister and Kunjali Marakars, Chief of Naval Force. In 1503, the Portuguese had built a fort in Chaliyam with the consent of the Raja of the Kingdom of Tanur (Vettattnad) from where they re-established supremacy over Indian waters. It provided the Portuguese ample opportunities to harass the Zamorin and enter the heart of his kingdom in the event of war. The Chaliyam fort was 'like a pistol held at the Zamorin's throat'. The Zamorin attacked Chaliyam and recaptured the fort in 1571 coinciding with the defeat of the ruler of Vijayanagara, an ally of the Portuguese. The Portuguese were forced to abandon the fort, which was then completely demolished. The fall of Chaliyam fort marked the beginning of the end for the Portuguese in the great game of the East. The Portuguese approached the Zamorin again in 1578 for reconciliation. By 1588 they were settled in Calicut and in 1591 built a church on land donated by the Zamorin (who even laid the foundation stone). The Zamorin's growing friendship was nevertheless a result of his gradual estrangement with the Kunjali Marakkars. By 1663, the Portuguese flag ceased to fly in Kerala as the Dutch arrived at the scene and captured all their strongholds of Quilon, Cranganore, Purakkadm, Cochin and Cannanore. Arrival of the Dutch The Dutch Admiral Steven van der Hagen reached Calicut and concluded a treaty on 11 Nov 1604. It provided for a mutual alliance between the Zamorin and the Dutch to expel the Portuguese from Indian soil. In return, they were given facilities for trade at Calicut, including spacious storehouses. The Dutch could not, however, stay for long. Their force weakened after constant wars with Marthanda Varma of Travancore (until 1753) and was forced to surrender to a British force that marched from Calicut to Cochin on 20 Oct 1795 (as part of the larger Napoleonic Wars between Holland and England in Europe). The Mysore invasions Hyder Ali ascended the throne of Mysore in 1761. By 1764, he obtained a pledge of neutrality from the British at Tellicherry in the event of a conflict with the Kerala powers. In February 1766, Hyder Ali marched into northern Kerala. Except for a few decisive battles, he faced meagre opposition and entered Calicut. The Zamorin sent the members of his family to Ponnani, blew up his palace and to avoid the humiliation of surrender committed self- immolation. A revenue officer named Madanna was appointed Civil Governor of Malabar with headquarters at Calicut. The rebellion soon broke out and the Mysorean garrison was besieged by the Nairs. Hyder Ali rushed to crush the rebellion devastating the countryside and employed draconian measures to suppress the Nairs including defrocking of their social status Successfully achieving his objectives, he had to return to Mysore soon to deal with the Maratha threat. Rebellion broke out again. Hyder Ali engaged in diplomacy this time through Madanna and agreed to withdraw his forces for which a war indemnity was to be paid to him. But he made a second attempt in December 1773 and re-established his authority in Malabar. However, with the help of the British, the Nairs led by the famous Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam, wiped out the Mysorean garrison in Calicut by 1778. By 1783 Tipu Sultan established his authority over Northern Kerala. He planned to shift the capital from Calicut to the south of the city on the banks of the river Chaliyar and even named it 'Farookhabad' now called Feroke. This ambitious plan soon failed. In November 1788, Calicut was attacked by the Nairs under Ravi Varma of the Padinjare Kovilakam. Tipu returned in 1789 to re-establish his authority. This, however, brought him in direct conflict with the British based in Madras, which resulted in four Anglo-Mysore Wars. Calicut and the surrounding districts were among the territories ceded to the British after the Third Anglo-Mysore War by the Treaties of Seringapatam with the British on 22 February and 18 March 1792. The newly acquired possessions on the Malabar Coast were organised into the Malabar District of Madras Presidency, and Calicut became the district capital. Engraving of the coast of Calicut (James Forbes, 1813) British domination The British reached Calicut in 1615 under Captain William Keeling and concluded a treaty of trade under which, among others, the English were to assist Calicut in expelling the Portuguese from Cochin and Cranganore, a term that the British never fulfilled. In 1664, Zamorin gave the English permission to build a factory in Calicut but did not extend any other favours as he was by now growing suspicious of all European traders. The English maintained neutrality in the conflict between Mysore and the Kerala powers in 1766 and was an important factor which facilitated early success to Hyder Ali. However, tensions between the English and Mysore arose soon. The English army under Major Abington helped Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam in the recapture of Calicut in 1782 from Mysore. The East India Company however did not stand by Lord Cornwallis' promise to the exiled rulers that they will be restored after the expulsion of Tipu. By 1792, the whole of Malabar including Calicut came under the British dominion. Ravi Varma now turned against the company but was soon captured in 1793. The rebellion continued even after the capture of Ravi Varma till 1797. National movement The city also witnessed several movements as part of the struggle for Indian independence from the British. A conference of the Congress was held at Calicut in 1904 with C. Vijayaraghavachariar in the chair. A branch of the All India Home Rule League founded by Ms. Annie Besant started functioning in the city. In 1916, Sri K.P.Kesava Menon staged a walk out of the Town Hall when he was denied permission by the Collector Mr Innes to address the meeting in Malayalam. The period saw a rise in political journalism as well. The Mathrubhumi in March 1923 and Al Amin in October 1924 were started by Sri K.P.Kesava Menon and Muhammad Abdur Rahiman respectively to foster the spirit of Nationalism. On 12 May 1930, Satyagrahi's assembled at Calicut beach under the leadership of Muhammad Abdur Rahiman to break the 'Salt laws' were attacked by the police injuring more than 30 people. K.P.Krishna Pillai and R.V.Sharma defended the National flag from forcible seizure by the police on this occasion. During the Second Civil Disobedience Movement (1932), all four hundred delegates who attended the All Kerala Political Conference in September 1932 were arrested. The incident wherein Mrs L.S.Prabhu (of Thalassery), who courted arrest during the conference, was ordered to surrender all her gold ornaments including the tali or mangalsutra received nationwide condemnation. Calicut was also a major centre for the rising Communist Party of Malabar (1939) and the Quit India Movement (1942). Kerala chapter of the Communist Party was formed in a secret meeting held at Kallai Road in the year 1937. After Indian Independence in 1947, Madras Presidency was renamed the Madras State. In 1956 when the Indian states were reorganised along linguistic lines, Malabar District was combined with the state of Travancore-Cochin to form the new state of Kerala on 1 November 1956. Malabar District was later split into the districts of Kannur, Kozhikode, and Palakkad on 1 January 1957.

It was used to execute criminals, often traitors, by hanging and to display their dead bodies as a warning to the population. It was a large structure located at the top of a small hill near the modern Place du Colonel Fabien in Paris, though during the Middle Ages it was outside the city walls and the surrounding area was mostly not built up, being occupied by institutions like the H√¥pital Saint-Louis from 1607, and earlier the Convent of the Filles-Dieu (\\"Daughters of God\\"), a home for 200 reformed prostitutes, and the leper colony of St Lazare. First built in the late 13th century, it was used until 1629 and then dismantled in 1760. As reconstructed in images by Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc it had three sides, and 45 compartments in which people could be both hanged and hung after execution elsewhere. A miniature of about 1460 from the Grandes Chroniques de France by Jean Fouquet, and also a print of 1609, show a somewhat less substantial structure than that in the reconstructions, which may, like others by Viollet- le-Duc, make the structure grander and more complex than was actually the case. The miniature shows bodies hanging from beams running across the central space, resting on the piers, but Viollet-le-Duc shows slabs running round the sides. Both show a substantial platform in masonry, which ran round a central space at ground level in the reconstructions, entered by a tunnel through the platform, closed by a gate. Another print of 1608 shows only two tiers of compartments rather than the three of Viollet-le-Duc. The English travel writer Thomas Coryat saw it at about the same time and described it as \\"the fayrest gallowes that I ever saw, built on a little hillocke ... [with] fourteen pillars of free stone\\". The structure was also used for displaying the bodies of those executed elsewhere; in 1416 the remains of were finally handed back to his family after three years at Montfaucon. Like an alarming number of other victims, Essarts had been one of the four royal treasurers. The gibbet was a great favourite of popular historians and historical writers of the 19th century, appearing in historical novels including The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (1831) by Victor Hugo,[ Book 11, Chapter 4] Crichton (1837) by William Harrison Ainsworth,Ballad in Chapter 1 Charles IX at Montfaucon, and later when Coligny hangs there. and La Reine Margot (1845) by Alexandre Dumas; both the last two tales centred on the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre.[ La Reine Margot, in translation] Executions Detail from the Grandes Chroniques de France, by Jean Fouquet, about 1460 The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572, by Fran√ßois Dubois.

As of 2011, it had a population of 21,000. It is about 20 kilometres from Gadhinglaj, and 30 kilometres from National Highway 4(NH4). Geography Nesari is located near the border of Maharashtra and Karnataka. The coordinates are . It has an average elevation of 625 meters, and average temperatures of 19 ¬∞C in winter and 26 ¬∞C in summer. Demographics According to the 2011 India census, Nesari has a population of 19,000 which includes Nesari town as well as extended areas included in the town.

Historic importance Prataprao Gujar, born Kudtoji Gujar, was the third royal Senapati of King Shivaji's army, which was probably the most successful guerrilla force in 17th century India. He was given the title of Prataprao (the brave) by King Shivaji in acknowledgement of his bravery in the war against Mirza Jaisingh. He was a highly gifted aristocratic general, who enjoyed the trust of his king and the loyalty of his troops. He defeated a large mughal army at the famous battle of Salher. Salher is a major battle between mughals and marathas, and the first large-scale pitched battle between the two in open field. The victory of the Marathas at Salher is seen as a definitive turning point in their military prowess vis-a-vis the Mughals. Prataprao Gujar's major drawback was his impulsive emotional nature. A few months before King Shivaji's coronation in 1674, Prataprao Gujar was sent to deal with the invading force led by the Adilshahi general, Bahalol Khan. The Maratha army surrounded the camp of Bahalol Khan at the place of Nesari. Prataprao's forces defeated and captured the opposing general in the battle. In spite of specific warnings against doing so by King Shivaji, Prataprao released Bahalol Khan along troops and the seized war material, when Bahalol Khan promised not to invade King Shivaji's territories again. Days after his release Bahalol Khan started preparing for a fresh invasion. When King Shivaji heard of about Prataprao decision, he was incensed and wrote an angry letter to Prataprao refusing him permission to see him till such time, until Bahlol Khan was re-captured. Prataprao realised his mistake and was so upset about what he had done that he now wanted to capture Bahlol Khan at any cost. One day, he learnt of Bahlol Khan camping nearby. Prataprao decided to make a stand against Balol Khan at Nesari. Prataprao Gujar with 1200 troops versus Khan with 15000. So, Prataprao reasoned that there was no point in taking 1200 men to suicide with him. So, in a fit of anger and overreacting to the letter, he left alone, without asking his cavalry to charge. It was his personal honour at stake, not his army. On seeing their leader head to certain death, 6 other Maratha sardars joined him in the charge, they attacked the enemy camp and were slaughtered. Anandrao and Hansaji Mohite, though, stayed back. It was an impulsive decision and the loss of Prataprao Gujar was a big loss to the Marathas. Anandrao Mohite managed to take the army to safer areas. King Shivaji's army avenged the death of their general, by defeating Bahlol Khan and looting his jagir (fiefdom) under the leadership of Anandrao and Hambirao Mohite. Hambirrao Mohite became the new Sarnaubat (Commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces). King Shivaji was deeply grieved on hearing of Pratprao's death. He married his second son, Rajaram, to the daughter of Prataprao Gujar; who was later to be the Empress of the Maratha Empire, Maharani Jankibai.[1] This event has been retold in the form of a Marathi poem \\"Vedaat Marathe Veer Daudale Saat\\". The poem is written by famous poet Kusumagraj. This poem has also been sung by Lata Mangeshkar. On 8 October 2014, DAR Motion Pictures, IME Motion Pictures and Blue Drop Films jointly announced a big budget Marathi feature film based on the famous battle. The film titled 'Saat' is slated for a 2016 release. 'Saat' has been written by Nikhil Mahajan and will be directed by debutante director Ashish Bende. The film will be produced by Arun Rangachari, Vivek Rangachari, Suhrud Godbole and Nikhil Mahajan.

There are two subspecies, Centrostephanus l. longispinus, found in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea and Centrostephanus l. rubricingulus, found in the western Atlantic. Taxonomy In 1940, Mortenson believed that C. longispinus and C. rubicingulus were closely related species but that they could be distinguished because C. longispinus has smaller and fewer secondary interambulacral tubercles. In 1975, Fell re-examined the genus but was unable to find sufficient differences to justify separating them into two species. He suggested that C. rubicingulus should be considered a sub-species of C. longispinus. Nor could he reliably distinguish the pair from C. besnardi except by the location from which they had been collected (C. besnardi is from the eastern Pacific). He was also unable to distinguish between juveniles of C. coronatus and juveniles of the other species. Description C. longispinus has a small central test and spines up to in length. These are toxic and can cause a painful sting. The spines are of varying length and are mobile and used for locomotion. There are a number of club-shaped spines on the oral (lower) surface, a characteristic that this species shares with C. besnardi and C. coronatus but not other members of the genus. These spines are reddish brown and are tipped with purple or pink pigment. The subspecies C. l. longispinus has spines banded in purple on a pale green, buff or whitish background. Juvenile C. l. rubricingulus have reddish-brown spines on a pale background while adults have either spines banded in brown on pale brown or uniformly dark-colored spines. It has been shown that C. longispinus has chromatophores (pigment bearing structures in cells) which are sensitive to light. By changing their shape, these alter the color of the animal, which is changed from a night-time black to a daytime greyish brown. Distribution and habitat C. longispinus occurs on the continental shelf on either side of the Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from the Mediterranean Sea and North African coast to the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The depth range is between . Off Florida this urchin is usually found on algae or on broken coral substrates, particularly the rubble remains of dead ivory bush coral (Oculina varicosa). It forms part of a species-rich community which includes other sea urchins, mollusks, polychaete worms, crabs and encrusting organisms. These sea urchins are not usually found on living reefs, perhaps because there is seldom macro-algae growing there or because predatory fish hiding among the coral heads consume the juvenile sea urchins. Biology Examination of the contents of this urchin's stomach have shown that C. longispinus largely feeds on several species of red algae. At times of year when this is not available it probably eats small invertebrate prey. In the laboratory they will feed on the seagrass Thalassia testudinum and may attack the starfish Narcissia trigonaria if hungry enough.

Bahrain was a dependency of the Persian Empire when in 1783, the Bani Utbah tribe led by Al Khalifa invaded it from their base in Al Zubarah (Qatar). The ruler of Al Khalifa was Ahmed bin Muhammad who became known as the conqueror. His successors faced many challenges over the next 75 years, yet they managed to keep Bahrain under their control. Externally, the island was under continuous threats from Oman and Wahhabis, both of which controlled it for short periods. Persians and Ottomans also made several claims over the country. In 1820 and later in 1861, Britain signed peace treaties with Bahrain and acknowledged Al Khalifa as its rulers. In 1867, a war erupted between Bahrain and Qatar, leading to British intervention and independence of Qatar from Bahrain. The British appointed a new Al Khalifa ruler, Isa bin Ali. During Isa's reign (1869‚Äì1923), there were no external challenges to the country as Britain defended it. He and his family enjoyed absolute powers, ruling over people as subjects and controlling much of the country as feudal estates. The public revenue of the country, collected then mostly as taxes and rents was the ruler's private income. The ruler used a special militant group to execute his orders via physical coercion. The backbone of the economy was palm cultivation, fishing and pearl diving. Palm cultivation, which the Shia practiced was tightly controlled by Al Khalifa. Control over pearl diving on the other hands was relaxed, as it was controlled by the Sunni tribes who kept a high level of autonomy and resisted intervention. The Shia power came from their jurists who had strong social power combined with large assets. In the end of the nineteenth century, Britain placed Bahrain under its protection and by the end of the First World War tightened its grip on the island. Starting from 1919, successive British political agents began implementing reform plans. The reforms of the twenties as they became known were administrative in nature. The Shia supported them, while the Sunni tribes and parts of the ruling family opposed them. Many petitions and counter petitions were submitted to various British officials. The country was divided and violence erupted from the opposing faction. The British intervened and replaced the ruler with his elder son, Hamad bin Isa, who supported the reforms. The reforms included the pearl industry, private properties, judicial system, policing system and education. In 1932, oil was discovered, leading to significant economical and social changes in the island. Pearl industry and palm cultivation were soon wiped out due to oil growing industry. Rise of Al Khalifa Al Khalifa, a Sunni family allied under the Bani Utbah tribe, settled in Al Zubarah (Qatar) in 1766 after moving to it from Kuwait. Originally, their ancestors were expelled from Umm Qasr in Iraq by the Ottomans due to their predatory habits of preying on caravans in Basra and trading ships in the Shatt al-Arab waterway. The Turks exiled them to Kuwait in 1716 where they remained until 1766. Around the 1760s, Al Khalifa migrated to Zubarah in modern-day Qatar.'Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. Vol I. Historical. Part IA & IB. J G Lorimer. 1915' [1000] (1155/1782), p. 1001 The Al Jalahma family, allied under the Bani Utbah tribe, soon joined Al Khalifa in Al Zubara, leaving Al Sabah as the sole proprietors of Kuwait.'Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. Vol I. Historical. Part IA & IB. J G Lorimer. 1915' [1000] (1155/1782), p. 1001 However, they disagreed later on the distribution of revenues, leading Al Jalahma to move to Reveish just east of Al Zubara. Al Khalifa attacked them there and killed their chief Jaber Al Jalahma. . Rule of Al Khalifa (1783‚Äì1869) Ahmed reign (1783‚Äì96) was stable and peaceful during which pearl production and trade grew significantly. However, during the next 75 years, Al Khalifa rule in Bahrain faced serious external and internal threats. Nonetheless, by allying with their enemies against each other, they managed to keep the island under their control. =External challenges= In 1796, Wahhabis occupied Al Zubara following their capture of Al-Hasa the year earlier. The defeated Salman bin Ahmed who succeeded his father moved to Jaww in the eastern coast of Bahrain, later moving to Riffa where he built an impressive fort. In 1799, ruler of Muscat, Oman launched an attack on Bahrain, but failed to control it. The next year he launched another attack, this time successful and appointed his son to supervise the island. In 1801, Al Khalifa, who fled to Al Zubara retook control over Bahrain, taking advantage of Omani fleet absence. The Omanis retaliated the next year, only to get defeated. Wahhabis, who supported Al Khalifa against Oman, placed Bahrain under their protection between 1803 and 1809 and direct control in 1810. As soon as the Wahhabis were weakened by the Egyptian advance in 1811, Al Khalifa announced their alliance with Oman and paid tribute to it for two years. Then, when Oman was weakened after their defeat by Al Qawasim, Al Khalifa announced their autonomy. Al Jalahma's leader Rahmah bin Jabir, based in Khur Hassan opposed Al Khalifa who he held a deep grudge against. He pirated their ships and supported their enemies until he was killed in 1826 in a dramatic battle. In 1820, Britain then the dominant power in the region signed \\"General Treaty of Peace\\" with tribal chiefs including Al Khalifa. By singing this treaty, Britain recognized Al Khalifa as \\"legitimate\\" rulers of Bahrain, however Britain also gave Persians a claim over Bahrain, which they kept invoking until Bahrain's independence in 1971. During that period Oman, not Persia was the main external threat to Bahrain; between 1816 and 1828 they launched four military campaigns to Bahrain, all failed with the last costing them devastating loses. During the reign of Muhammad bin Khalifa (1843‚Äì68), threats to Bahrain came from the Wahhabis, Ottomans and Persians. Muhammad tried to appease both the Ottomans and Persians by pretending to support both of them simultaneously. For the Wahhabis, he used military action, which Britain opposed and offered in secret to defend Bahrain. When Muhammad refused to stop his campaign, Britain directly intervened, besieging his war fleet and forcing him to call off the attack. The British blockage ended with the signing of the Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship in 1861, by which the ruler of Bahrain was not to engage in \\"prosecution of war, piracy and slavery at sea\\" and Britain was to provide protection. Britain then eliminated all external threats against Bahrain; they bombarded Wahhabis in Dammam, and used diplomacy to neutralize Persian and Ottoman ambitions. =Internal challenges= Elevation drawing of a mosque in Bahrain, 1825. Al Khalifa held Bahrain as feudal estates and an occupied territory; they imposed taxes on local population to collect as much revenue as possible, with special focus on the Shia population. Al Khalifa initiated a series of land and property confiscation, and destruction of local sources of strength that lasted to the early 1930s. The Shia, who claim to be the indigenous population of Bahrain speak of an ideal past before invasion of Al Khalifa in which an assembly of Shia jurists would elect a smaller assembly which would in turn elect a council of three. Khuri (1980) mentions that it is very hard to either support or reject their assertion regarding the council of jurists, because documentation is lacking, but argues that it could be a \\"mythical reaction to their physical and social agonies during and after the conquest [of Al Khalifa]\\". Once external threats were reduced in 1828 following Oman's heavy loss, the Al Khalifa became engaged in a series of internal conflicts among themselves. These conflicts caused more damage to Bahrain economy and society than that of external invasions, the Shia suffered most of which. Soon after Al Khalifa arrived to Bahrain, they became divided into two factions, one led by Salman bin Ahmed based in Bahrain mainland and the other led by his brother Abdulla based in Muharraq Island. Gradually, Muharraq became almost independent, having its own tribal administration. Khalifa bin Salman succeeded his father in 1826. Khalifa's death in 1834 escalated the internal conflict as his uncle, Abdulla became the sole ruler of Bahrain. Abdulla's reign (1834‚Äì43) was full of conflicts and wars that caused much chaos for Bahrain; its trade declined to half and many locals, especially the Shia were forced to emigrate to other ports such as Al-Muhammarah due to the oppressive extortion and looting they were subjected to. In 1835, Abdulla ruthlessly crushed an uprising in Qatar led by one of his sons and supported by Al Bin Ali and Al Buainain. In 1842, he entered a conflict with his grand nephew, Muhammad bin Khalifa who fled to Riyad following his defeat. Muhammad, now supported by Wahhabis moved to Al Zubara where he made allies with Al Jalahma and Al Bin Ali. With his brother Ali in Manama, they defeated Abdulla who then fled to Dammam. Between 1844 and 1846, Abdulla launched three failed attempts to reclaim the throne from various locations, before finally leaving to Muscat where he died in 1849. In 1867, an uprising erupted in Wakra and Doha in Qatar. Muhammad, seeking to gain time invited Jassim Al Thani of Doha to Bahrain for negotiations, but arrested him upon his arrival. In October of the same year, he declared war on Qatar. The British considered this a violation of Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship and sent their troops to Bahrain. Muhammad fled to Qatar, leaving his brother Ali as ruler of Bahrain, who then surrendered to British demands of giving up their war vessels and paying a fine of $100,000. In addition, Al Khalifa had to renounce claims of sovereignty of Qatar, which was recognized by Britain as a separate entity. Muhammad returned to Bahrain after his brother convinced the British to allow him in, however they soon deported him to Kuwait after accusing him of engaging in conspiracies. Muhammad made his way to Qatif, and with the help of Nasir bin Mubarak bin Abdulla and Muhammad bin Abdulla they were able to place the latter as ruler after Ali bin Khalifa was killed in battle. Two months later, in November 1869, the British navy intervened, under the command of Colonel Lewis Pelly, and took control of the island. Ringleaders, except for one were exiled to Mumbai (previously known as Bombay). The British then, after talks with chiefs of Al Khalifa, appointed the 21 years old Isa bin Ali as the ruler of Bahrain, a position he would hold until 1923. From this point till independence, security and foreign relations of Bahrain were in complete control of the British. Economy and administration during reign of Isa bin Ali (1869‚Äì1923) The management of economic resources as well as government and tribal sovereignty was in the hand of tribal councils (), which were not regulated by standardized law or procedures. Social and personal affairs were managed by religious courts (). Each council power was derived from the economic resources which it controlled. During the period, the economy of Bahrain depended on pearl diving, fishing and palm cultivation. These settings existed long before the reign of Isa bin Ali, however they were well represented during it. World War I disrupted elements of Bahrain's politics, society, economy and trans-regional networks.John Slight, \\"Global War and its impact on the Gulf States of Kuwait and Bahrain, 1914‚Äì1918.\\" War & Society 37#1 (2018): 21-37. https://doi.org/10.1080/07292473.2017.1412185 =Ruler's authority= A portrait of Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa, date unknown. Unlike regular tribal councils, the ruler had a supreme council known as diwan and used physical coercion to collect tax or whatever they wanted from people. In the words of Khuri (1980) the ruler was \\"the 'government' without offices, the 'administration' without bureaucracy [and] the 'state' without public delegation or consent, standardized law or equity.\\" The autonomy of the ruler was not much different in terms of quality from that of other sheikhs (members of Al Khalifa family) who controlled an estate, except that he had higher quantity of resources and assets. The Ruler controlled all ports and markets, and many estates including Manama and Muharraq, the two largest cities of the country. The administration apparatus at Manama and Muharraq was headed by a high ranking fidawi known as emir and composed of thirty other fidawis. In Riffa, where Sunni Arab tribes lived, the emir was an Al Khalifa member. There was no distinction between the ruler's private income and public revenue, instead all public revenues including taxes and rentals were considered private earnings of the ruler. Much of the revenue was spent on ruler's retinue and so little or none at all on infrastructure such as schools and roads, and when it occurred, it was thought of as a personal act of charity. Distant relatives of the ruler were assigned to manage his estates and his brothers and sons were given their own estates in order to avoid internal conflicts. Government-related jobs were exclusive to the Sunnis whereas market-related were confined to the Shia and foreigners. The ruler and most sheikhs lived in Muharraq city and none lived in the Shia villages. Their fidawis and council members followed them wherever they lived. Fidawis were the military arm of the authority; their main job was to execute sheikhs orders via physical coercion. They were composed of Baluchis, African slaves and Sunni Arabs who's tribal origin could not be traced. They had sticks and were authorized to interrogate, arrest and punish those deemed wrongdoers. Fidawis arbitrary way of handling law and order was complained about by Bahrainis. Fidawis were also responsible for claiming forced labor, known as sukhra () in which they would round up a random group of adult males from public places such as the market and then assign them using force to a specific task. The men would not be freed until they complete the task, which usually did not require skillful labor and could be finished in no more than two days (e.g. construction). =Palm cultivation and estate administration= Palm cultivation used to be one of two backbones of the Bahraini economy. Most cultivation in Bahrain was confined to palm trees; vegetables and fodder were only grown in small amounts. Palms were mainly located in the northern shores which compromised the cultivable land in the island. Unlike the pastoral nomads of central Arabia who lived off the camel, Bahrainis lived off the palms; its dates were a basic in their diet, branches used for construction of houses and fish traps, flowers and buds for medicine and leaves for making baskets. Local culture was also deeply affected by palms; many stories, songs, myths and even classification of persons revolved around them. Cultivation of palms required full-day work during all sessions of the year. Most cultivators were Shia who engaged all members of their families in the job: children and adults, male and female. It was their only source of subsistence. Palm cultivation was tightly controlled by the ruling family, who also served as landlords; on one hand, the lands they directly administered were farmed out as fiefs and on the other they collected taxes on private lands, and confiscated the property of those who failed to pay. Only Shia had to pay taxes, as they were not a part of the army, despite never being invited to join it. Land was divided into a number of estates which were administered by sheikhs, mostly brothers and sons of the ruler. The size of each estate was not fixed; it increased or decreased based on the power and influence of its owner; the closer relation to ruler's line of descent, the more power and thus larger estates. For instance, when a ruler died, management of estates would shift from his brothers and sons to the brothers and sons of the new ruler, and the new ruler's cousins would not inherit their fathers' (brothers of the previous ruler). Mothers also played an important factor, especially if they belonged to the ruling family. Sheikhs who controlled an estate enjoyed a high level of autonomy within it, almost as high as the ruler himself; they imposed taxes, resolved disputes and protected their subjects against outsiders, including members of Al Khalifa family. They did not interact with farmers directly, rather they had a wazir who would rent palm gardens via some middlemen, then to individual farmers. A wazir, which means minister in Arabic, is a Shia trusted by the sheikh. Sometimes wazirs would act as special advisers of the sheikh. As well as wazirs, sheikhs' administration included kikhda and fidawis. Kikhda were Shia assigned to collect taxes. Due to the nature of their job, wazirs and kikhda, who lived in Shia villages, had a leading position in society, but in villages that were heavily taxed such as Bani Jamra and Diraz, they were so hated that they escaped to Manama following reforms of the 1920s. In total, there were two to five individuals between the sheikh and the farmer. Contracts were oral before the reforms of the 1920s, after which they were written down. Rents were dependent on yield, increasing and decreasing with it, which meant farmers were always left with no more than the essentials of survival. =Fishing= Bahrain waters are rich in fish of various types. Fish had no capital value (not imported or exported), thus fishing traps, the main method of fishing in the island were not controlled by Al Khalifa. Most Bahrainis had one thing or another to do with fishing and sea, which they knew about as much as northern Arabs knew about camel and desert. Specialized fishermen known as rassamin built fishing traps and rented them for U.S. $150 to $5000 a year with the most expensive in Sitra island. The ruling family owned a small percentage of fishing traps, while Shia owned most of them. =Pearl diving= Boats like this were used for pearl diving Pearl diving in the region was well known for thousands of years, however it only achieved economic consequences in the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries. In 1876, pearl diving in Bahrain produced about ¬£180,000 annually and by 1900 it rose to ¬£1,000,000, accounting for over half value of all exports. However, in 1925 it only produced about ¬£14,500. Pearls were shipped to Mumbai and from there to the rest of the world. Indian merchants, known as Banyan became active in exporting pearls from Bahrain to Mumbai. At the end of the nineteenth century, Bahraini and European merchants took the role of Banyans, but instead exported pearls directly to Europe. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, pearl diving became very important for the sustenance of thousands of Bahrainis, with almost half of adult males working in pearl diving. Stretching from May to October, the official pearl diving season was known as al-ghaws (). Gradually, few rich merchants known as \\"kings of pearl\\" were able to control the pearl industry, because boats supplies were expensive and good divers required high amount of money to recruit. Boat crew was divided into six categories: the pilot (nukhada; ), his assistant, divers, pullers, apprentices and servants. While in the sea, the pilot who was usually of tribal origin and owned the boat had the authority to try and punish wrongdoers and to resolve disputes. Unless they were beyond his knowledge, crimes on boat were dealt with on the basis of \\"eye for eye and tooth for tooth\\", otherwise they were dealt with after returning to land. The rest of crew were southern Persians, Baluchis or slaves and only few of them were native Shia. Divers and pullers worked as a team; divers stayed at bottom of sea collecting pearl oysters until they were short of breath, after which they would pull the rope attached to them and the more numbered pullers would pull them back to boat. Good divers lasted longer underwater and could make 100 dives a day. They had more prestige than pullers, but were also exposed to hazards such as eardrum rupture and blindness. Although pearl diving yielded a lot of money, divers and pullers share was small, while pilots and merchants got most of it. Disputes over shares and loans were normally taken to Islamic courts, but whenever it was about pearls, it was taken instead to a special court known as the salifa which was biased to merchants and pilots as its judge was always of tribal origin. In almost the same system as in palm cultivation, interests on loans increased with pearl catch, thus divers and pullers were almost always in loan to the pilot who in turn was in loan to the merchant. Skillful divers were given bigger loans, which meant they were more in debt and thus had to continue working with same pilot as they could not pay the loan and its high interests (up to 50 percent) on their own, especially that loans were hereditary from fathers to sons. They could take another loan from another pilot to pay the first, but they would still be stuck in the system. Only few divers were compensated as reward for their loyalty and hard work. Pearl diving was controlled by Sunni Arab tribesmen, who enjoyed high autonomy within their estates; they resolved disputes and held their own courts, but stopped short of collecting taxes. Each tribe had control over specific pearl banks. The power of each tribe was derived from their overall power in the Gulf and Arabia. The most powerful tribe was Al Dawasir who lived in Budaiya and Zallaq; they were wealthy, numerous and could mobilize many allies in Arabia. In order to attract as many pearl tribes as possible, Al Khalifa did not interfere with pearl diving, nor did they impose taxes on boats or catches. This increased volume of exports and thus increased taxes on them. It also increased local trade and rents. Interfering in tribes affairs had negative consciences, as they threatened to emigrate, which meant decline in trade and an implicit threat of war. This was the case of Al Bin Ali in 1895 and Al Dawasir in 1923 both of which emigrated from the island. Khuri (1980) argues that Al Khalifa tight control over palm cultivation and relaxed measures with regard to pearl diving does not mean their purpose was to favor Sunnis and oppress Shia, instead he says their purpose was to increase their revenues as much as possible from both groups; Sunni tribesmen strongly resisted any interference in their affairs and had better production in relaxed atmosphere. =Religious courts= Religious courts at the time followed Sharia (Islamic law) which itself is derived from the Qur'an and Hadith. There were four different juristic groups in Bahrain at the time: Urban Hawala (Sunni) who followed Shafi'i law, urban Najdi (Sunni) community who followed Hanbali law, tribal Arab Sunni community which followed Maliki law and the Shia community which followed Ja'fari jurisprudence. During the entire reign of Isa bin Ali, Jassim al-Mihza was the sole jurist that served the Sunni community. Appointed by the ruler, al-Mihza ruled over personal and family matters such as divorce and inheritance, but loans associated with pearl diving were excluded as Sharia speaks clearly against loan interests. Instead, the aforementioned loans were taken to the tribal salifa court. The Shia courts on the other hand were numerous and independent of the ruler. They were not appointed nor inheritors, but attained their position by charisma and intrinsic properties. They used ijtihad (interpretation) instead of qiyas (analogy). Shia jurists had more social power than their Sunni counterparts, because they were independent of the government and religion had more social influence on Shia as they believed in taqlid, which stands for religious imitation. In addition, Shia jurists controlled the redistribution of income of Shia endowment properties, which included land, fish traps, houses, shrines and more. The Shia endowment properties were much more than the Sunni, and were run in a similar way to tribal councils, except that principles of Islam were followed. Thus Shia jurists represented an alternative to the government; they were looked upon by their followers as the \\"legitimate\\" authority, whereas the ruler treated them as religious leaders. =British Protectorate= The British signed two further treaties with Al Khalifa in 1880 and 1892, putting the defense and foreign relations of Bahrain in the control of Britain and turning Bahrain into a British colonial protectorate. Following an incident in 1904, in which a relative of the ruler attacked Persians and Germans, the ruler agreed to place foreigner affairs in British hands. The term \\"foreigner\\" was vague, because Bahrain had no naturalization policy, population census or emigration office. This and the rapidly growing number of foreigners as a result of the pearl boom created a dual authority system, one led by the British agent and the other by the Al Khalifa ruler (Isa bin Ali). During the First World War, Bahrain was threatened again by Wahhabis, who re-occupied the eastern part of Arabia, Ottomans and Persian, both of which did not drop their claims over the island. Britain responded to tightening its hold over Bahrain. Bahrainis were not sympathetic with the allies, which the British attributed to their lack of attention toward Shia oppression and enforcement of reforms. When war ended, Britain changed its policy in Bahrain from being cautious and giving advises to the ruler, to directly implementing reforms.  Administrative reforms  The administrative reforms took place between 1919 and 1927. The nature of the reforms, sometimes referred to as \\"reforms of the twenties\\" was administrative, not political as they did not involve the issue of government legitimacy or any form of public representation. Instead they were more focused on reshuffling of public offices and economic resources. These reforms were not a result of British intervention only, as other factors such as Bahrain social order and its tribal regime had a considerable weight. The main result of these reforms was the establishment of a modern bureaucracy. Starting from 1919, H. R. P. Dickson, then the British political agent began reforming schools, courts, municipalities and other institutions of the country. In 1919, a joint court headed by Dickson and Abdulla bin Isa, the son of the ruler was established to deal with cases of foreigners against Bahrainis. The next year, fidawis were abolished after a Municipal Council was formed. All council members were appointed, half of them by ruler and half by British, and were tasked with civil responsibilities. In 1923, the salifa court was abolished and replaced by the Customary Council. The council was formed in 1920 with its members appointed the same way as in the Municipal Council, but it was given rule over trade, including pearl industry. During the same year a Shia jurist was appointed in the government. These reforms were rejected by Al Khalifa and their allies, who sent many petition to Mumbai government against Dickson's reforms. =Challenges to reforms= Photograph of Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa (1872‚Äì1942), date unknown. Dickson was replaced with Major C. K. Daly (1920‚Äì26), who unlike his predecessor used tough and uncompromising measures to introduce reforms. He started by undermining the influence of Abdulla bin Isa, who strongly opposed the reforms and strengthening his elder brother and the heir apparent, Hamad bin Isa. By 1921, the country was divided into two camps, the first supporting the reforms composed of Hamad bin Isa, the British political agent and the Shia (who at time composed about half of population), and the second opposing reforms composed of the ruler, his son Abdulla and tribesmen. A series of pro and anti reform petition were submitted by the two factions to different British officials including the Foreign Office. The Shia, so desperate to get rid of the tribal regime, demanded in one of their many petitions to Daly that Bahrain is placed under formal British protection. The latter, who supported their demands, wrote a letter to a higher official in which he mentioned the mismanagement and corruption of Al Khalifa as well as the \\"atrocities and oppressions\\" they had committed, especially by Abdulla bin Isa. The other faction, mainly the tribal chiefs and pearl merchants, rejected the reforms on the basis that equity and standardization of law would remove their advantages such as exemption from taxes and sovereignty over estates. The Bombay government was cautious and moved slowly; 1922 ended without implementing reform plans. This encouraged Al Khalifa and Al Dawasir, who perceived themselves as biggest losers, to use violence. The latter called for help from Wahhabis who controlled Al-Hasa and wanted to annex Bahrain to their newly formed theocratic state. Full scale violence erupted in 1923 after smaller incidents the earlier year. It took a socio-ethnic pattern as urban Najdi Sunnis fought against urban Persian Shias and tribal Sunnis against Shia villagers. Al Dawasir of Budaiya and some members of Al Khalifa attacked Shia villages of Barbar, A'ali and Sitra, and riots erupted in Manama between Najdis and Persians. These resulted in twelve people killed, dozens wounded and women raped as well as destruction of properties. The violence settled after the British fleet arrived in Bahrain and after that ruler Isa bin Ali was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Hamad. The petitions and political crisis, however continued to the reign of Hamad. Hamad began his reign (1923‚Äì42) by setting up a criminal court to try those involved in the violence; Al Dawasir and sons of Khalid bin Ali Al Khalifa. Al Dawasir intimidated and killed some Shia witnesses and killed two Shia notables who encouraged others to witness against them. This time, Al Dawasir were taken to courts where they were forced to pay fines. This marked the first time in Bahrain's history they were subjected to public law. Soon after, about two thirds of Al Dawasir left for Dammam and the rest remained, only to follow them shortly after the ruler had given them a deadline to either return or leave altogether. Although the Wahhabi emir of Najd promised to exempt Al Dawasir from taxes, he later demanded it from them. This coupled with the loss of half of their fleet during emigration, the confiscation of their properties in Budaiya and blockage from diving in Bahrain pearl banks, resulted in weakening them economically and politically, and eventually led them in 1926 to plead to ruler of Bahrain to allow them back. In 1927, the ruler allowed them to return, but only as regular subjects, which only a small part of them accepted and returned. The other part of the opposition faction was composed of sons of Khalid Al Khalifa, the ruler's cousins who attacked Sitra. The ruler was put in a dilemma between his tribal alignment and public law, and so he exiled his cousins, but paid their expenses. His cousins, however held deep grudge against residents of Sitra island who witnessed against them, and in 1924 attacked the island before their exile, killing several Shia men, women and children. Sons of Khalid Al Khalifa were sentenced to death following major Shia protests and a lengthy trial, but luckily for the ruler, they managed to escape before the sentence was carried out. =Implementation of reforms= A failed assassination was attempted on the ruler by one of his cousins in 1926, but aside from that, the rest of his reign was without major disturbances and he proceeded to implement the administration reforms. In 1926, a new \\"adviser\\" position was created to deal with internal affairs of Bahrain. From its creation and until 1957, it was occupied by Charles Belgrave, who became known locally as \\"the adviser\\". ;Pearl industry The reforms in pearl industry, which took place between 1921 and 1923 were the \\"testing point\\" for the whole reform process as they were met with the strongest resistance from tribes. Once this tribal resistance was broken, the way was open for other reforms to take place. These reforms focused on protecting divers interests and limiting merchants monopoly on the pearl industry. They included separating commercial activities from pearl diving and requiring pilots to write down an account for every diver in a book held by the diver. In the 1930s, the pearl industry lost its momentum due to a number of factors including production of cultured pearls and discovery of oil. ;Private properties and public rights Starting from early twenties, a decade- long intensive cadastral survey was carried out to register private properties by an Indian team. Those who occupied a land for ten years or more, or had the ruler-issued \\"gift declarations\\" were given ownership of the land. Difficulties soon aroused within the ruling family over distribution of former estates, but a deal in 1932 was reached that included abolishing forced labor and tax collection, and establishment of a \\"family court\\" to deal with intra- Al Khalifa disputes. In total, the ruling family owned 23% of palm gardens making them the second largest landowning category after private landholders. Land renting was put under government supervision, with parties to it having to write out and submit to authorities the terms and conditions of contracts. With taxes and forced labor abolished, there was no need for wazirs and kikhdas and so these positions were abolished as well. A lighter state taxation system was introduced, it only contributed to a small percent of state budget, while the biggest part was through customs, especially those on pearl industry. The ruling family received much of the budget; in 1930 half of it was allocated to them either as allowances or salaries. ;Judicial system Having no standardized penal code, the Joint Court established in 1919 used Indian, British or Sudanese code as appropriate with local customs. Before the establishment of Bahrain Court in 1926, cases were taken to the Joint Court, Sharia courts or the Customary Council. Bahrain Court served as the lowest and highest in the country until a Bahrain Lower Court was established in 1927 and an appeal court in 1939. It was headed by the adviser and a member of Al Khalifa. Religious courts were integrated into a central judicial system, but were subsidiary to the Bahrain Court, which resulted in weakening the power of Shia jurists. ;Policing system The fidawis were replaced by municipal police in 1920. In 1922, Persians composed most of the police, but in 1924 one hundred Baluchis were recruited. The Baluchis were disbanded later after several incidents of incompetence and indiscipline, and were replaced by retired Indian Army Punjabis that served until 1932. The policy of recruiting from \\"minority cultures\\" continued and due to this Bahrainis avoided joining police that they only constituted 20% of it by the 1960s, the rest being foreigners (Balushis, Yemenis, Omanis, etc.). Bahrain army was founded in 1968 and adopted the style of the Jordanian army. Bahrainis, especially those of tribal origin (Sunnis) composed the majority of its recruits, while villagers (Shia) only composed a small percentage within the noncombat departments. In general, Sunnis of tribal origin dominated the authoritative departments such as justice, interior, military and emigration, while the Shia dominated the technically based such as water, health, finance and electricity. ;Education The first school in Bahrain was the American Missionary School (now known as Al Raja School), built in early nineteenth century. It only attracted Christians and Jews initially, and Bahrainis only started sending their children to it in the 1940s and 1950s. The first two Arabic schools in Bahrain were divided by sectarian lines; al-Hidaya built in 1919 in Muharraq was for Sunnis, while al-Ja'fariyah built in 1929 in Manama was for Shia. The Al Khalifa saw this sectarian division as a threat to their authority, and in 1932-33 both schools were opened to public with their names changed to Muharraq and Manama primary schools respectively. In the following years more public schools were opened and an education department was founded. Discovery of oil first oil well in Bahrain was discovered in 1932alt= A survey of the geology of the Persian Gulf region was conducted in 1912, believed to be the region's first. In 1914, Bahrain's ruler granted to the British that he would not order the exploitation of oil nor grant any oil concessions without their prior approval. The first oil concession was given to the Bahrain Petroleum Company in 1928. Oil was later discovered in Bahrain in 1931, with the first shipment exported in a year. Few years later, an oil refinery was built in Sitra to process and refine Bahrain's 80,000 daily barrels in addition to 120,000 barrels from Dammam in neighboring Saudi Arabia connected to it via a pipeline. In the following decades, oil royalties increased significantly; from $16,750 in 1934, to $6.25 million in 1954 and to $225 million in 1974. The discovery and production of oil brought several economical and social changes to the island. Economically, pearl diving and palm cultivation, then the backbones of the Bahraini economy were almost wiped out. Pearling boats reduced from 2,000 in the 1930s, to 192 in 1945 and to none in the 1960s. Oil production provided stable work opportunities, not only in Bahrain, but in the whole Persian Gulf region to which many Bahrainis emigrated to. This in addition to emigration of pearl tribes reduced the number of divers, leading to the eventual decline of pearl diving. Palm cultivation decline shared the same reasons, but was more gradual, dropping sharply only in the 1960s and after. Instead of farming palms, vegetable cultivation emerged and the first became a luxury venture. Further reading *Mahdi Abdalla Al-Tajir (1987).

The organization mainly seeks to represent the interests of the native Jains of Maharashtra (Marathi Jains), Karnataka (Kannada Jains) and Goa.  History  The organization was founded in 1899. It was originally found to represent the Jains of the southern Maratha Country of the Bombay Presidency, including Kolhapur State, Belgaum and Sangli. The organization was established for the socio-economic and educational betterment of the Jain community. It has been credited for fostering a stronger sense of Jain identity and for ushering in social reforms in the Jain community. The association sought to invest authority in lay persons rather than in ascetics, this resulted in mobilization of the community to build schools and improve education. The current president of the organization is Raosaheb A. Patil.  Community service  The organization has been involved in securing the status of an independent and minority religion for Jainism in India. The organization funds various educational institutions. They also offer scholarships to meritorious Jain students from South India. They also honor distinguished people from the Jain community annually. The Karmveer Bhaurao Patil Samaj Seva Puraskar awards are given annually to notable personalities. There are also awards presented for excellence in journalism.

The Philippines established formal diplomatic relations with Thailand on June 14, 1949. The relations between the two are described as warm and friendly. Thailand is one of the Philippines' major trade partners and one of the Philippines' sources of rice through Thai exports. Bilateral relations continues to be strengthened through talks and agreements on economic, security and cultural matters including concerns on rice trade, fight on drugs and human trafficking. Thailand has an embassy in Manila, while the Philippines maintains an embassy in Bangkok. History Thai (Siamese) in the Philippines, c. 1590 via Boxer Codex The Philippines and Thailand began its relation way-back in the 13th century in the context of Southeast Asian maritime trade. Archaeological records point not only to commercial and cultural ties but also a recognition of their political stature. Siam with its kingdoms and the Philippines with its rajahs. There were also ceramic wares from Sukhothai and Sawankhalok found in Luzon and Visayas region as evidence of early relations. Southeast Asian wares found in the Philippines from the 13th century to 16th century period were mostly from Siam. In 1586, two decades after Spain set foot in the Philippines, Siam was mentioned as a possible goal of commercial interests and physical expansion and the first contact was made between Spain and Thailand.

During this period, the biggest import of the Philippines to Thailand was rice and Thailand's biggest import from the Philippines was abaca. As early as 1926, Philippine universities and colleges began to accept students from Thailand.

On June 14, 1949, official diplomatic relations were established between the Philippines and Thailand. During the later years of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos' term and President Corazon Aquino's term, from 1978-1992, relations between the Philippines and Thailand remained friendly, but were in some aspects neglected due to economic crisis and the political situation in the Philippines during the Martial law era. The relations were strengthened again after the said period. Bilateral relations were further reinforced during a state visit of the Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha in 2015 to the Philippines. Agreement signed A Treaty of Friendship signed by both countries in 1949. Bilateral and trade relations between the two countries continue to be characterized by harmony, dynamism, and warmth and strengthened when they became founding members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in 1954 and ASEAN in 1967. Several bilateral agreements have since been signed on defense, investment, environment, tourism, air services, and scientific, technical, agriculture, and telecommunications exchanges. Thailand and the Philippines signed three agreements on taxation, energy and business cooperation during a high-level Thai delegation's visit to the Philippines in 2013. One of these agreement between the education ministries of the two countries will be signed on exchange of English language teachers to improve language proficiency of the Thai people.

Hawkes collaborated with the group on their debut EP, Invisible Embraces, produced by Anthony Resta (Duran Duran, Blondie, Collective Soul), and joined New Collisions onstage at several early shows. The following year New Collisions released their first LP, The Optimist, produced by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie (Radiohead, The Pixies, Hole). Matt James of PopMatters praised the lead single, \\"Dying Alone,\\" calling it \\"spunky, spiky, new wave with smart cookie lyrics and a melody big enough to earn its own zip code.\\" iTunes gave the album a positive review, writing, \\"With a sense of style and a minimum of irony, the New Collisions pull off the difficult feat of reworking familiar sounds into something fresh and vital.\\" Between 2009 and 2010, New Collisions went on seven national tours, one of which was as the opening act for The B-52s. They also provided tour support for Blondie, Missing Persons, Owl City, The Constellations, You Say Party, The Morning Benders, and performed at CMJ 2009 and 2010 and at SXSW 2010.

The SNL was an inventory system used from 1930 to 1958 to catalog all the items the Army's Ordnance Corps issued. The AIC was used by the US Army's Ordnance Corps from January, 1942 to 1958. It listed munitions and explosives (items from SNLs P, R, S, and T), items that were considered priority issue for soldiers in combat. The markings used by the system made it easier for soldiers to quickly identify and procure the right items. It used a code that had five parts. # The first character consisted of the item's SNL Group and was represented by its letter. # The second character indicated the sub-group and was represented by its number. # The third character represented the weapon or weapons that could use it and was represented by a letter. # The fourth character represented the type and model of ammunition (i.e., Training Blank, Ball, Armor-Piercing, Incendiary, Tracer, etc.), which differed from weapon to weapon, and was represented by a letter. # The fifth and last character detailed the packing method (Cartons, Bandoleers, or Belts / Links) and container type used (M1917 Rifle Ammunition Packing Box, M23 Ammo Crate, etc.) and was designated by a letter. The AIC was replaced by the FSN (Federal Stock Number) in 1958, which later became the NSN (National Stock Number) in 1975. Packing Terminology =Cartons= Ammunition came packed in single-ply chipboard cartons lined with Manila paper. A label marked with the number of cartridges, caliber and type of ammo, manufacturer, and Lot Code was glued over the top flap, front, and back to seal the carton. Wartime boxes (1942 to 1945) had wide vertical colored stripes, like those used on the packing box, as a background for the text. This allowed the soldier to quickly visually identify the ammo he needed. .45 ACP .45 ACP ammo for the Colt M1911 semi-automatic pistol and Thompson submachine gun originally came in 20-round boxes. It was later changed to 50-round boxes in 1942 for ease of packing and distribution. They were packed in the small M1917 Pistol Ammunition Packing Boxes. .45 ACP ammo for the Colt M1917 and Smith & Wesson M1917 revolvers came packed in 3-round Half-Moon clips. They were packed eight clips per carton in two-row (2x12 cell ‚Äì sideways interlocking \\"zig-zag\\" style) or three-row (3x9 cell ‚Äì inline overlapping \\"spoons\\" style) rectangular cartons of 24 rounds. They were packed in the larger M1917 Rifle / Machinegun Ammunition Packing Boxes. .30 Carbine M1 Carbine ammo was originally packed in 3-row 45-round boxes to reduce waste, as the carbine had a 15-round magazine. This was later changed in 1942 to 50-round boxes to ship as much ammo as possible. They were packed in a special small wooden crate, perhaps so a soldier wouldn't grab the wrong ammunition. .30 Caliber .30-caliber rifle (Grade \\"R\\") and machine gun (Grade \\"MG\\") ammo came in 20-round boxes. Early-war cartons for use in bolt- action rifles like the Springfield M1903 came with the ammo already in 5-round stripper clips. .50 Caliber .50-caliber machine gun ammo (Grades \\"AC\\" and \\"MG\\") came bulk-packed in 10-round boxes for loading into belts or links in-theater. =M1917 Ammunition Packing Box= A wooden box designed to be reused. The lid was secured by tightening brass wingnuts over threaded metal posts in the walls of the chest. They were meant to be carried by means of handles milled into the ends of the chest; troops assigned to carry ammo found them hard to grasp.Sledge, Eugene. With the Old Breed... Ammunition was shipped in boxes with a waterproof zinc metal lining that had the top soldered on to seal it; this was ripped open using a wire handle built into the top. It came in two standard sizes. There was a large packing box (Dimensions: 18-7/16\\" Length √ó 9-7/16\\" Width √ó 14-13/16\\" Height; Tare Weight: 9 lbs. Volume: 1.49 cubic feet) secured with 6 threaded posts (one on each end and two on each side). It was used to store and carry .30- and .50-caliber ammunition. The smaller box (Dimensions: 16-7/16\\" Length √ó 12-11/16\\" Width √ó 7-5/8\\" Height; Volume: 0.92 cubic feet) was secured with 4 threaded posts (one on each side). It was used for pistol and submachine gun ammunition. Another box (Volume: 0.83 cubic feet) was used for carbine ammunition. Pre-war and early-war chests were made of brown stained or painted wood with yellow lettering. In 1943, a system of colored stripes across the middle of the long sides and lid to indicate the contents. Pistol, rifle and medium machine gun ammunition had the stripes painted vertically on the long sides and lid and horizontally on the wide sides. Heavy machine gun ammunition had the stripes painted diagonally on the long and wide sides and the lid. Mid- to late-war chests were unstained with black painted lettering. They used the box's AIC code and a system of symbols to indicate the contents at a glance. Packing Box Stripes A straight stripe indicated Pistol, Carbine, Rifle and Medium Machine gun ammunition; it was vertical on the long sides and top and horizontal on the ends. Triple straight stripes were painted horizontally with the first stripe on top and the third stripe on the bottom. A diagonal stripe (lower left corner to upper right corner) indicated Heavy Machine gun ammunition. Triple diagonal stripes were painted with the first stripe on the left-side and the third stripe on the right side. If packed in cartons, the colored stripe was duplicated on the carton's label. :Red = Ball. :Orange with wide Green stripe = Dim Tracer (1600 yards range) or Subdued Tracer (50 to 140 yards before ignition / 1,000 yards range). :Yellow with wide Red stripe = Incendiary. :Yellow with wide Red stripe inset with narrow Green stripe = Incendiary Tracer. :Yellow with wide Green stripe = Bright Tracer (3,000 yards range). :Yellow with wide Blue stripe = Armor-Piercing. :Yellow with wide Blue stripe inset with narrow Red stripe = Armor-Piercing Incendiary. :Yellow with wide Blue stripe inset with narrow Green stripe = Armor-Piercing Tracer. :Green = Dummy. :Blue = Blank. :Blue with wide White stripe = Rifle Grenade Blank. :Triple Red, Yellow, and Green Stripe = Linked Ball & Tracer. :Triple Yellow, Red, and Green Stripe = Belted Ball & Tracer. :Triple Yellow, Blue, and Red Stripe = Belted Armor-Piercing & Incendiary. :Triple Yellow, Blue, and Green Stripe = Belted Armor-Piercing & Tracer. :Triple Blue, Yellow, and Red Stripe = Linked Armor-Piercing & Incendiary. :Triple Blue, Yellow, and Green Stripe = Linked Armor-Piercing & Tracer. =Commercial Shotgun Shell Packing Box= A wooden or fiberboard box with a waterproof tarpaper lining designed to transport and carry shotgun shells. It held 20 √ó 25-shell cartons (500 total shells) of 12 gauge ammunition and weighed around 65 lbs (Dimensions: 15\\" Length √ó 10.375\\" Width √ó 9.75\\" Height; Volume: 0.88 Cubic Feet). Guard shells had either a brass base (base only) with a full paper hull or partial brass case (1\\" long) and a long paper hull. Combat shells had either a partial brass case (1\\" long) with a long paper hull or a full (2.75\\" long) brass case and no paper hull. Sporting shells (used for trap shooting or hunting) either had a brass base with a full paper hull or a partial brass case (1/2\\" long) and a long paper hull. =Ammunition Crate= A metal-strapped wooden packing crate designed to be thrown away that replaced the M1917 Packing Box. They were made of plain, unpainted wood and had its lettering, AIC code, and symbols stamped on in black ink. They were carried by a horizontal rectangular wooden bar fastened to the pair of vertical wooden reinforcing struts on each end. Some crate contractors looped a semi-circular piece of thick rope through a hole in each reinforcing strut for use as a flexible handle. Other contractors used a folding two-strut metal handle fastened between the reinforcing struts for heavier loads. The cartons of ammunition inside were originally grouped and packed in corrugated cardboard boxes. The boxes were then coated and sealed in a waterproof wax coating to keep the ammunition inside from being affected by the environment. There were 2 boxes per crate and they were loaded in the crate sideways so the bullets would fly off to the sides rather than through the top or bottom. The weatherproofing was found to be ineffective, so the cardboard boxes were replaced by ammunition cans in the autumn of 1943. =Ammunition Can= A vacuum-sealed metal canister with wire handles on its sides. They were first produced at the Evansville, Indiana Chrysler-Sunbeam plant in 1943 to pack .45 ACP ammunition in M5 cans. It was opened using a metal can key (like a can of sardines) that was soldered to the top. It could be reclosed afterwards using a small roll of duct tape that came packed in the can. They were painted Olive Drab and had yellow lettering on them. The caliber of ammunition ‚Äì .45, .30C (Carbine ‚Äì cartons), .30R (Rifle ‚Äì clips or cartons), .30M (Machine gun ‚Äì belted or linked ammo), or .50 ‚Äì was embossed in raised letters and numbers on the metal lid so they could be identified by touch under low-light conditions. The model of can (M5, M6, M8, M10, M13, etc.) was embossed on the bottom. The M5 cans were for packing .45 ACP ammo and weighed about 29 lbs. The M6 cans were for packing .30 Carbine ammo and weighed about 25 lbs. The M8 cans were for packing .30 Rifle & Machine gun ammo and weighed about 16 lbs. The M10 cans were originally for packing .50 Machine gun ammo but later on were also used to pack shotgun shells or a variety of other ammunition in cartons. The M13 can was for issue with a rifle grenade launcher and packed an assortment of six .30 Carbine M6 rifle-grenade blanks, ten .30-'06 Springfield rifle-grenade blanks, and a packet of five booster charges. The instruction \\"Do Not Use As Food Container\\" was prominently painted on the can. The lead and chemical residue inside the container could contaminate the food and poison the soldier. The Korean War‚Äìera universal M20 and M21 cans replaced the earlier assortment of cartridge-specific cans. The M20 was a rounded-edged cube with a folding handle on top. The M21, twice the height of the M20, was a taller version of the M20. They lacked the embossing of the earlier cans. Repacked Ammo Cans Old or damaged lots of ammunition were inspected, salvaged, sorted and repacked for re-use. Repacked ammunition was usually resealed in an unpainted ammo can with the information (including the last two digits of the year it was repacked) stamped on the container in black ink. The original manufacturer and lot code was retained and all salvaged rounds were usually from the same lot. If the new lot was salvaged from more than one lot, the arsenal that did the repacking would use their letter code in the place of the original manufacturer(s) along with a new lot code. The repacked crate would have a line of text beginning with \\"REPACKED LOT:\\" followed by the manufacturer or arsenal code and the lot number. In 1945 this text was replaced with \\"FUNCTIONAL LOT:\\", as troops had been leery of using \\"used\\" ammunition. =Standard Ammunition Box= A re-closeable metal box with a hinged metal lid sealed with a foam-rubber gasket to keep out moisture and rain and a folding metal handle to aid in carrying it. They were originally designed to only store belted machine gun ammunition, but later became a standard container after the war for all sorts of ammunition packed in cartons and / or clips and bandoleers. Originally planned to be disposable, they were recycled for reloading. The ammo boxes were originally painted Olive Drab Brown (OD3) with white lettering, but were later painted Olive Drab Green (OD7) with yellow lettering. The early individual M1 and M2 series metal boxes were also painted with the same colored ammunition identification stripes as the pre-war and early-war M1917 wooden packing crates. They were first shipped individually, but were later bulk-packed in unpainted wire-bound plywood crates with stencil-painted or ink-stamped lettering. The .30 M1 and M1A1 ammo boxes were packed four to a crate that weighed around 90 pounds and had a volume of 1 cubic foot. The M1 ammo crate held a total of 1,000 belted or linked rounds packed in 4 M1 ammo boxes and the later M1A1 ammo crate held a total of 1,000 belted or 1,100 linked rounds packed in M1A1 ammo boxes. There were two .50 M2 ammo boxes to a crate (for a total of 220 belted or 210 linked rounds) with a volume of 0.93 cubic feet. The later M2A1 can also came packed two to a crate (for a total of 200 linked rounds) with a volume of 0.85 cubic feet. * The M1 box (made from 1942 to 1945 and phased out by the 1950s) opened from the side, had a flat bottom, had a catch opposite from the box's hinge for attaching the can to the M1917 / M1917A1 / M1918 / M1928 tripod, and had a pair of concentric oval ribs on the long sides to reinforce them. Inside the rings was embossed two lines of text: \\"CAL .30M\\" / \\"AMMUNITION BOX\\"; with the \\"M\\" standing for Machine gun ammunition. The initials \\"U.S.\\" and the US Army Ordnance Corps' \\"Flaming Bomb\\" symbol were embossed on the hinge side. It held 250 belted rounds of .30-caliber ammo and was designed to replace the similar but less durable M1917 wooden machine gun ammo boxes. (Dimensions: 10-3/16\\" Length √ó 3-3/4\\" Width √ó 7-7/32\\" Height; Weight (empty): around 3.5 lbs.; Net Weight (250-round M1 cloth belt): 15.5 lbs ; Gross Weight (loaded): 19 lbs. ; Volume: 0.1595 Cubic Feet).Hogg, Ian V. The American Arsenal, p258. Frontline Books (2014). The M1A1 Box that replaced it (June 1945 ‚Äì 1950s and phased out in the early 1960s) was a little taller (11\\" Length √ó 3-13/16\\" Width √ó 7-19/32\\" Height), had a more durable rubber gasket, and held 250 belted or 275 linked rounds of .30-06 ammo. The M1A1 model can be distinguished from the earlier M1 by the different embossed text, which reads \\"CAL .30 M1\\" / \\"AMMUNITION BOX\\" in the oval; the \\"M\\" now stood for Model. Later cans were embossed with \\"CAL .30 M1A1\\" / \\"M.M.G. BOX\\". There were also some minor improvements. The tripod catch side was redesigned to be slightly angled at the bottom and top rather than flat to fit flush alongside the tripod mount. * The later M19 Box (1946 to 1953) that replaced the M1 series was a product-improved model that eliminated the earlier model's weaknesses and added improvements. It retained the rubber gasket, eliminated the tripod catch, and had smooth sides. The major difference between the M19 and the M1 series are the M19 series' lid skirts, which made the M19 series visually distinctive from the M1 and M2 series. They are designed to lock in place while part-way open to protect the belted ammunition inside from the elements while it feeds into the weapon. The M19 box held 250 belted or linked rounds of .30-06 ammunition. The narrower M19A1 box (1954 to present) was redesigned to hold the shorter, thicker 7.62mm NATO service cartridge, which replaced the .30-06 Springfield in 1954. It also incorporated a series of improvements that corrected faults discovered during the Korean War. The lid was redesigned and the gasket was adjusted to allow it to close properly and remain sealed in cold weather ‚Äì as the contracting metal would either stick shut or make it impossible to close once opened. An overhang was added to the lid and the latch was made wider to make it easier for soldiers with gloved hands to open it. It had a hollow on the bottom that was high enough to fit over the folding handle on the top of the box beneath it, allowing the boxes to be neatly stacked on top of each other. For ease in loading, a cartridge shape was embossed in the edge of the lid and center of the base to show which way the belt it contained faced (a feature that was later discontinued). It can hold 220 linked or 225 belted 7.62mm NATO rounds in bulk or 2 √ó 100-round linked belts packed in cartons and carried in bandoleers. The M19A1 box is also used to store pistol ammunition in cartons. (Dimensions: 3 13/16\\" [96.8mm] Width √ó 7 1/4\\" [184.2mm] Height √ó 11\\" [279.4mm] Long. Weight: 3.81 lbs. (1.72 kg.) Volume: 0.175 Cubic Feet) * The M2 box (September 1942‚Äì1950) had 4 rectangular \\"feet\\" embossed into the bottom of the box that ran along the edges of the sides, square ribbing around the edges of each side, a foam-rubber gasket, and opened from the front like a tool box. It had a small folding wire handle on the left side corner to secure it to a tripod. On the front side the bottom arc of the ribbing running along the bottom edge was embossed: \\"AMMO BOX CAL .50 M2\\". The back side was usually where the content information was stenciled because there was more empty space. It held 110 belted or 105 linked rounds of .50-caliber ammo. (Dimensions: 12 ¬º\\" Length √ó 6 ¬º\\" Width √ó 7 ¬Ω\\" Height; Weight (empty): 4.4 lbs.; Gross Weight: 35 lbs.; Volume: 0.33 Cubic Feet). The M2A1 Box (1950‚Äìpresent) opens from the side (but lacks the tripod catch of the similar M1 series), has smooth sides and a rubber gasket, had a hollow bottom like the M19 box, and holds a standardized 100 linked rounds. The M2A1 box is commonly used today to store a variety of ammo in cartons, clips, and bandoleers.

The primers for the cartridges were non-corrosive because the M1 carbine's gas- system would have fouled or corroded if standard corrosive primers were used. It only came in Grade R (\\"Rifle\\") because the M1 Carbine was semi-automatic only, dispensing with the use for Grade 2 for an automatic weapon.

Each M1 bandoleer had 6 pockets (containing 2 stripper clips each) for a total of 120 rounds per bandolier. The stripper clips did not require a separate magazine guide because they had a magazine guide built-in to speed reloading. :TACAL = 1,200 cartridges of .30 Carbine Ball M1 in 10-round stripper clips in bandoleers packed in M20 ammo cans.

There were three cartridge grades based on accuracy and reliability: \\"AC/R\\", \\"MG\\", and \\"3\\". Test batches would be randomly drawn from a lot and they would be chambered and fired individually from a fixed bench- rested barrel and mechanism at a stationary round \\"bullseye\\" target 600 feet away. \\"AC\\" (Aircraft), the most accurate and reliable, was similar to the RAF's \\"Red Label\\" ammunition used in their synchronized aircraft machine guns. It had to be grouped within a 5-inch circle and not exceed a specified maximum number of stoppages to be acceptable. It came in metal linked belts and was suitable for aircraft and anti-aircraft machine-guns. \\"R\\" (Rifle) had to be grouped within a 5-inch circle; it came packed in cartons or bandoleers and was suitable for use in rifles. \\"MG\\" (Machine Gun), the least accurate, had to be grouped within a 7.5-inch circle; it came in woven belts and was suitable for use in ground machine-guns. Class 3 (Unsuitable) was rejected for not meeting standards. Ammunition Lot Numbers had a code letter prefix in-between the Manufacturer code and Lot Number to indicate how it was packed: \\"C\\" indicated rifle ammunition preloaded in clips, \\"B\\" indicated Belted (woven cloth belt) machine gun ammunition, and \\"L\\" indicated Linked (disintegrating metal link belt) machine gun ammunition.

Gross Weight:71 lbs. Volume: 1.4 cubic feet. Belted Note: The symbol for belted or linked 0.30-06 Springfield ammunition was a vertical string of cartridges pointing right. Most early 0.30-'06 machine gun ammunition manufactured during World War II was belted rather than linked due to a steel shortage. All metal-linked ammunition was reserved for the Army Air Force and Naval Aviation. When the US Army Air Force .30-caliber machine gun was superseded by the .50-caliber machine gun mid-war, all .30-caliber ammunition began to be belted in M1 250-round belts for infantry use or M3 100-round woven belts for use in vehicles and tanks. Post-World War II production used linked ammunition. In a belt with mixture of ammunition types the number and type of rounds per 5- or 10-round segment is used. If different ammunition types were used in the segment, they were alternated (for example, A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA‚ÄìB‚ÄìC rather than A‚ÄìA‚ÄìB‚ÄìB‚ÄìC), with the tracer round (C) at the end. Usually one round in five or ten was tracer, to show the gunner the trajectory; pre-War belts used a 1-in-10 mix and War and Post-War belts used a 1-in-5 mix. :T1ECT = 1,500 cartridges .30-06 M1-linked (4 √ó AP M2, 1xTR M1) in cartons (250-round belts), 6 cartons per metal-lined wooden chest M1917.

Belted (1939‚Äì1948) Note: The symbol for belted or linked 0.50-caliber BMG ammunition was a diagonal string of cartridges pointing from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. The type of ammunition was indicated by a code letter prefixed to the ammunition's Lot Number. \\"B\\" stood for Belted (woven cloth belt) and \\"L\\" stood for Linked (disintegrating metal links). Due to a steel shortage, linked belts were originally reserved for the Army Air Force and Naval Aviation. Machine gun ammunition for ground use was supplied in 110-round M7 woven belts for infantry and 50-round woven belts for vehicles and tanks. After the Allies achieved air superiority over Europe around the fall of 1944, linked rounds began being issued to ground units. In a belt with a mixture of ammunition types the number and type of rounds per 5- or 10-round segment is used. If different ammunition types were used in the segment, they were usually alternated (for example, A-B-A-B-C rather than A-A- B-B-C), with the tracer round (C) at the end. Usually one in five or one in ten cartridges were tracer. :T1IBA = 300 cartridges .50 linked (Ball M2). :T1IBW = 265 cartridges .50 linked (AP M2), in metal-lined wooden chest M1917.

The company shut down on January 4, 2005. History Brothers Pat Lee and Roger Lee founded Dreamwave Productions in Toronto, Canada in 1996 as an imprint under Image Comics, publishing their first mini- series Darkminds. Pat maintained artistic control while Roger managed the business operations. Dreamwave split off from Image Comics in April 2002. Dreamwave acquired the license for the Transformers toyline from Hasbro in December 2001. The first mini-series, written by Chris Sarracini & drawn by Pat Lee and based on the Transformers: Generation 1 characters, was the top- selling book on the sales charts for its entire run. Various Transformers ongoing and limited series followed, covering various continuities within the Transformers franchise. Writers James McDonough and Adam Patyk left the company in November 2004 over pay disputes. On January 4, 2005, Dreamwave announced that they had gone out of business and closed down, citing \\"the shrinking comic book market combined with a weak U.S. dollar\\" as the reason for their closure. In late April 2005, freelancers who were still owed money by Dreamwave discovered they were also liable for debts incurred by Dreamwave. According to the terms of the contract the company had with Federal Express, the freelancers were left liable for the cost of shipping their unpublished, unpaid for work to Canada. Guido Guidi and Don Figueroa were two such freelancers affected. After the company's bankruptcy in January 2005, Dreamwave's assets were auctioned off on August 2, 2005 and purchased by Canadian entrepreneur Christian Dery, who planned to relaunch its original properties. However, the new Dreamwave have not published nor announced the publishing of any titles since the 2005 announcement. IDW Publishing acquired the Transformers license in May 2005 and began publishing new Transformers comics in 2006.

The book argues that global capitalism is terminally ill because it suffers from four fatal flaws: growing inequity and concentration of wealth, addiction to speculation instead of production, rising unsustainable debt and its tendency to exploit the natural environment. The author proposes a grassroots movement for economic democracy with cooperatives and local economies based on the Progressive Utilization Theory or Prout, a post-capitalist model conceptualized by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar of India. The book includes a conversation with Noam Chomsky and essays by Frei Betto, Johan Galtung, Leonardo Boff, Sohail Inayatullah, Marcos Arruda, Ravi Batra and others. Background The author's first book, After Capitalism: Prout‚Äôs Vision for a New World, with a preface by Noam Chomsky, was published in 2003 and, subsequently, translated into nine other languages. However, when the author started to update it, he discovered that both the world and the development of Prout had changed so much that more than 80 percent of the text was actually new material. Beyond this, economic democracy, a fundamental demand of Prout, was also starting to resonate with the Indignados Movement of Spain and the global Occupy Movement. Hence this book has a new title.

Afterword: \\"The Possibility of Creating Another World is in Our Hands\\" by Frei Betto. Appendices: Discussion questions about the book, designing Prout Study Action Circles, Prout slogans. Critical response =Praise= Bill Ayers in Left Eye on Books wrote, ‚ÄúIn just a few pages I felt the brotherly embrace of a comrade-in-arms, a soul-mate, and a companion; further along his fierce intelligence and original insights challenged me to make new connections; by the end I was inspired to re-imagine next steps in my own efforts at movement-making.‚Äù‚ÄúTrudge Toward Freedom: A Review of ‚ÄúAfter Capitalism‚Äù by Dada Maheshvarananda \\" by Bill Ayers, Left Eye on Books, Jan. 15 2013‚Äù Gar Alperovitz, author of America Beyond Capitalism, wrote, \\"An ambitious and stimulating attempt to connect spiritual principles with the pragmatic work of building a better world.\\" Gregory Wilpert, author of Changing Venezuela by Taking Power, wrote, \\"After Capitalism is a crucial contribution towards figuring out where we want to go, not only after capitalism, but now, as we try to build the new world within the old.\\" Ecologist Bill McKibben wrote, \\"There are plenty of interesting leads in these pages that will get you thinking!\\" George Katsiaficas, activist and author of Asia's Unknown Uprisings, wrote: \\"With grace and intelligence, Dada Maheshvarananda illuminates paths of personal enlightenment and global transformation.\\" Charles Eisenstein, author of Sacred Economics, wrote, \\"A broad ecological, social, political and spiritual awareness informs this vision of a new economic future.\\" David Schweickart, author of another book entitled After Capitalism, wrote, \\"This is an amazing book, breathtaking in its range and ambition.\\" Peter Bohmer, activist and faculty at the Evergreen State College, wrote, ‚ÄúI enthusiastically recommend this book for a college classroom and for those who are organizing for economic and social justice.‚Äù = Mixed = Jeff Fleischer in ForeWord Reviews wrote, \\"Most of the book is simply an explanation of Prout, and has the same strengths and weaknesses of the theory itself. While many of the goals advocated by Maheshvarananda and Prout supporters‚Äîsuch as diminishing income inequality and promoting citizen cooperatives‚Äîare certainly admirable, the theory is often vague about how they would be achieved or what a transition to a Prout economy would look like on a large scale... Too often, After Capitalism will seem naively unrealistic to opponents of Prout's vision while simultaneously obscure and lacking in specifics for those who would like to see its principles applied... Maheshvarananda is more effective in his critique of how current economic systems have created global wealth inequality, and at citing statistics for how poverty has spread even in wealthier nations. The most interesting parts of the book, however, are the guest contributions, which serve as case studies of using Prout principles in specific, smaller-scale projects around the world. While these contributions are quite short, they offer some of the detail lacking in the overall treatise.\\"‚ÄúAfter Capitalism: Economic Democracy in Action, by Jeff Fleischer, ForeWord Reviews, Dec. 5 2012.‚Äù See also *Criticism of capitalism *Dada Maheshvarananda *Post-capitalism *Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar *PROUT Notes and references External links *Prout Research Institute of Venezuela *After Capitalism =Reviews and interviews= *Radio interviews of Dada Maheshvarananda with Maeve Conlan of KGNU Independent Community Radio in Boulder, Colorado, Dec. 11 2012 and Dec. 13, 2012. *Trudge Toward Freedom: A Review of ‚ÄúAfter Capitalism‚Äù by Dada Maheshvarananda by Bill Ayers, Left Eye on Books, Jan. 15 2013 *After Capitalism: Economic Democracy in Action, by Jeff Fleischer, ForeWord Reviews, Dec. 5 2012.

The film is shot in black and white with the entire cast composed of local actors speaking their natural dialect. \\"Jiseul\\" means \\"potato\\" in Jeju dialect. O said he picked it as the title of his film because \\"potatoes are considered a staple food in many countries, often symbolizing survival and hope.\\" Set during the Jeju Uprising on the island in 1948, O said the film does not focus on the large-scale struggle, but on a forgotten true story about a group of villagers who hid in a cave for 60 days to escape from a military attack. They hid underground for months, cold and numb, far too close for comfort‚Äîjust like the potatoes to which the title refers. The film had a small budget of (), part of which was raised through crowdfunding. It premiered at the 2012 Busan International Film Festival where it received 3 awards‚Äîthe CGV Movie Collage Award, the Director's Guild of Korea Award for Best Director, and the NETPAC Jury Award. Jiseul later won the prestigious World Cinema Dramatic Grand Jury Prize at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. It became the first Korean film ever to win the top prize in this category. Festival organizers said that the jury's decision was unanimous, and their deliberation lasted less than one minute. It also won the Cyclo d'Or, the top prize at the 2013 Vesoul International Film Festival of Asian Cinema, and Best Film at the inaugural Wildflower Film Awards in 2014. The broader response from critics and international audiences was more mixed, with some viewers feeling frustration at not being given more background information in the film.  Plot  In November, 1948, the U.S. military stationed in South Korea issues an order that all people living five kilometers outside the coast line of Jeju island are labelled as communist rebels and can be executed on sight. When a small village on Jeju Island (located off Korea's Southern coast) receives the eviction order, its barely literate inhabitants simply can't gauge the order's import. Some 120 villagers flee to a cave and hide for 60 days from armed soldiers. Many of the soldiers are young recruits, shivering in the November snow, who are aware that the people they are shooting are not communists. Meanwhile, the villagers, huddled in the cave, grow more and more anxious about the people and livestock they have left behind. They suffer from severe cold and hunger but retain their sanity by making jokes and holding on to the hope that their wait is almost over. Eventually their endurance wanes, and fear begins to test the group's mettle.

Until the late 1990s, mention of the incident, which reportedly destroyed more than two-thirds of the island's villages and killed 30,000 people, the vast number of them innocent civilians, was a criminal offense. Filming location Many of the scenes were shot in Dongbaekdongsan Wetland, a Ramsar Wetland. Box office After winning a major award at Sundance, the film rode enthusiastic word-of- mouth to rack up a box office score almost unheard of for small-budget independent films in Korea. With 144,602 admissions, it became the most viewed indie dramatic film, beating the 2009 record of Yang Ik-june's Breathless (122,918). The only other independent feature of this type to break out so dramatically was the documentary Old Partner, which amassed close to 3 million admissions during its 2009 release.

It was launched on 7 May 2013 aboard Vega VV02 carrier rocket and successfully deployed into orbit. The CubeSat standard for nanosatellites was followed during the engineering of ESTCube-1, resulting in a 10√ó10√ó11.35 cm cube, with a volume of 1 liter and a mass of 1.048 kg. The mission ended officially in 17 February 2015 and it was said that during this time it resulted in 29 bachelor's and 19 master's dissertations, 5 doctoral theses and 4 start-ups.\\"ESTCube-1's 651-day career: 53 dissertations and a marriage proposal\\" ERR, 17 February 2015 The deployment of the E-sail tether was unsuccessful, and thus no measurements were taken of the E-sail or of the plasma braking deployment system. Last signal from ESTCube-1 was received in 19 May 2015. Scientific purpose The first image of Earth taken by ESTCube-1 on May 15, 2013. ESTCube-1 E-sail experiment The structure illustration of cubesat ESTCube-1 ESTCube-1 structure Developed as part of the Estonian Student Satellite Program, ESTCube-1 was an educational project in which university and high school students participated. While emphasis was placed on educating students during creation of ESTCube-1, it did have a scientific purpose. The satellite carried an electric solar wind sail (E-sail) which was invented by Finnish scientist Pekka Janhunen. During the ESTCube-1 flight, 10 meters of 20‚Äì50 micrometer thick E-sail wire, sometimes referred to as \\"Heytether,\\" were to be deployed from the satellite. The deployment of the Heytether was to be detected by a decrease of the satellite's rotation speed or an onboard camera. To control the E-sail element's interaction with both the plasma surrounding the Earth and the effect it had on the spacecraft's spinning speed, two nanotechnology electron emitters/guns were on board. The electron emitters were connected to the E-sail element which was to be charged positively to 500 volts by shooting out electrons. The positive ions in the plasma were intended to push the E-sail element and influence the satellite's rotation speed. The effect of the plasma on the E-sail was to be measured by the change in said rotation speed. The tether had also been intended to de-orbit the satellite by use as a plasma- brake to demonstrate a possibility for returning small satellites from orbit. A color CMOS camera was also on board that was capable of making RAW-format pictures with VGA-resolution. This camera was used to acquire images of Earth and had been intended to monitor deployment of the Heytether. Orbit To complete the scientific experiment and communicate with the satellite on several occasions the orbit chosen was a sun‚Äìsynchronous circular orbit at an altitude of 670 kilometers. ESTCube-1 was launched into orbit by Arianespace, using Vega VV02 rocket which lifted off from ELA-1 at Kourou at 02:06:31 UTC on 7 May 2013. The satellite was placed into orbit and communication successfully established,Matteo Emanuelli, Estonian Cubesat on a Collision Course with Iridium-Cosmos Debris, August 1, 2013, Space Safety News (accessed Aug. 16 2013) with the first photo of the Earth taken on May 15 and transmitted to the ground on the amateur radio band.Southgate Radio Amateur News, First picture from ESTCube-1 ham radio CubeSat , May 22, 2013 (accessed Aug. 16 2013) Lifespan of the satellite The plan, beginning with the 7 May 2013 launch, included the following steps: *Half an hour after the satellite's deployment from the start capsule, the satellite's antennas were deployed and radio transmitter and important subsystems were switched on. *During first 48 hours after the deployment, the satellite sent only safe-mode CW beacon signals. *The first weeks were used to test the satellite and set it to work at full capacity. *Orientation of the satellite so the on-board camera was facing Earth to acquire images of Estonia. That goal was achieved during the project. *Rotation of the satellite on its longitudinal axis with a speed of 1 revolution per second. ESTCube-1 became possibly the fastest controlled rotating satellite in history, reaching angular velocity 841 ¬∞/sec. *E-Sail element deployment from the satellite by centrifugal force was attempted in mid-October of 2014, however, the deployment failed, possibly due to a stuck reel. No confirmation of the deployment was received via the on-board camera, and further E-sail experiments were not conducted. *After the failure of E-Sail tether deployment, on-board cold cathode electron emitters were successfully tested. =End of mission= The mission ended due to degradation of the photovoltaic power system and subsequently the batteries became exhausted. The last official transmission was transmitted on 17 February 2015, however, imaging the Earth and gathering environmental data continued till May 19, 2015. The plan to test a solar sail the satellite carried failed since the sail cable unwinding mechanics did not survive the rocket takeoff vibration.

By standard 1 unit (1U) CubeSat base side length must be 100.0¬±0.1 millimeters and satellite height must be 113.5¬±0.1 mm. Mass is also set in CubeSat standard, the highest possible mass for 1U CubeSat is 1300 grams. =Communications= Communication from the satellite was made at two International Amateur Radio Unions registered frequencies *437.250 MHz *437.505 MHz Periodic but very slow communication was made by using 18 WPM telegraphy signal on a frequency of 437.250 MHz. At that frequency, the most important satellite parameters are returned every 3 to 10 minutes. For fast connections FSK-modulation radio signals on a frequency of 437.505 MHz with a 9600 baud connection speed and AX.25 packet standard is used. The relatively slow connection speeds result from the use of amateur radio frequencies which limits the bandwidth to 25 kilohertz. The fast connection is used only when the satellite has been given a specific order. Both telegraphy and packet telemetry protocols of ESTCube-1 are published on project webpage. Commands sent to the satellite used the 145 MHz (2 meter) amateur band. =Software= ESTCube-1 microcontrollers use the following operating systems: *FreeRTOS on the satellite's Command and Data Handling System and camera module. *TinyOS on the satellite's communication module.

Because Estonia is an associated member of ESA, most of the launch expenses (about 70,000 euros) were covered by the Estonian member fee for educational expenses. With the launch, total expenses for the project were approximately 100,000 euros. Results The satellite successfully demonstrated the operation of the systems in space, with a two-year operational life. The deployment of the E-sail was unsuccessful, and no measurements were taken of the E-sail or of the plasma braking deployment system.

Formerly called Gimnazija \\"Aleksa ≈†antiƒá\\" (–ì–∏–º–Ω–∞–∑–∏—ò–∞ \\"–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞ –®–∞–Ω—Ç–∏—õ\\") in honour of the eponymous poet, it is nowadays popularly referred to as Stara gimnazija (The Old Gymnasium).  Background  The first gymnasium in Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in 1879 in Sarajevo, capital of the Austro-Hungarian Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mostar, the largest city of the Herzegovina region in the south of the Condominium, was by then a developed education centre, second only to the capital. It had a merchants' school, 18 primary schools (two secular schools, one Orthodox, one Catholic girls' school, 4 Muslim boys' schools and 10 Muslim girls' schools), a private German school and a kindergarten. None of the schools, however, prepared students for a higher education, forcing parents to send their minor children to Sarajevo. In February 1893, the local branch of the Serbian Orthodox Church appealed to the National Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The government was concerned that the student body would be too small, expecting Muslims (the most numerous religious group in Mostar) not to be interested. The Orthodox clergymen thus pointed out that their desire was shared by Catholics. The National Government would only allow a lower gymnasium, but the superior Ministry of Finance of Austria-Hungary ordered that the new school be a full gymnasium and opened within 1893. Teachers' and principal's posts were advertised throughout the entire Austria-Hungary.  Establishment and construction  The school was ceremoniously opened on 26 October 1893 and, despite concerns raised by the National Government, it immediately enrolled members of all of Bosnia and Herzegovina's religious groups: Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Muslims and Jews. The first teaching staff was formed by three teachers, including the Slovene philologist Martin Bedjaniƒç (1855‚Äì1931), whose assigned subjects were Bosnian and Latin and who also served as he first principal, and the biologist Antun Pichler (1862‚Äì1922), who taught Natural Sciences. They were joined the same year by a Catholic and an Orthodox religion teacher, by their Muslim counterparts the following year, and finally by a Jewish religion teacher. Until the present building became functional in 1898, classes were held in a leased house of the city councillor Husaga Komadina (brother of the future mayor Mujaga Komadina). Besides instructions in Islam, Serbian Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism or Judaism, the compulsory subjects were Bosnian, German, Latin, Greek (or, alternatively, Classical Arabic for Muslim students), Geography and History, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Philosophical Propaedeutics, Free-Hand Drawing, Penmanship and Gymnastics. Singing, French, Italian, Stenography and Gusle were optional subjects. The Minister of Finance B√©ni K√°llay took it upon himself to provide the gymnasium with a proper building. The first design was offered by the Czech architect Max David in 1897, but K√°llay turned it down and gave the project to another Czech architect, Franti≈°ek Bla≈æek. The first half of the gymnasium was completed in 1898 and the second in 1902. Featuring Andalusian and Mamluk elements as an example of Moorish Revival architecture, the building is the result of Austro-Hungarian desire to promote Bosnian national identity while avoiding its association with either the Ottoman Empire or the growing pan-Slavic movement by creating an \\"Islamic architecture of European fantasy\\". The gymnasium is thus of historic value and is considered a national monument. The first students included the geographer Jevto Dedijer (whose lowest grade was in Geography), the poet Osman ƒêikiƒá (awarded for performance but later expelled for political activity) and the journalist Risto Raduloviƒá. The first girls to enroll the school, in 1905, were Jewish sisters Marija (1894‚Äì1987) and Berta Bergman (1891‚Äì1945), later a university professor and a physician respectively. Marija was, for a time, also employed as German Language teacher at the gymnasium.  Yugoslav period  The school belonged to the most renowned and academically prestigious educational institutions in Yugoslavia, and was possibly the most reputable school in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It numbered 2,000 students, including Bosniaks, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs alike. The school alumni include the historian Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá, the philosopher and poet Dimitrije Mitrinoviƒá, and the writer Predrag Matvejeviƒá. The Communist activist and future Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina Avdo Humo also attended the gymnasium before being evicted in November 1931 due to \\"committing political transgressions at school\\". The gymnasium was considerably damaged due to shelling during the Bosnian War, particularly so during the Croat‚ÄìBosniak War, being located at the front line. Following the war, classes for Bosnian Croat students were held on a single floor of the ruined building, with Bosniak students returning in 2004. Renovation of the gymnasium started the same year and was completed in 2009.  Present  Gimnazija Mostar in 2011 Gimnazija Mostar presently operates under two separate secondary school curricula and in two completely mutually intelligible language varieties, Bosnian and Croatian, with sports and a few classes combined. Though it was originally intended to fully integrate subjects or at least the science ones (Biology, Chemistry, Information Technology, Mathematics and Physics), the idea of unification was fiercely opposed by local politicians, especially Croat officials who felt that their national identity was being threatened. Nevertheless, integration has been achieved to a certain extent in what has been called a \\"rare social experiment\\". Students themselves mostly welcomed the desegregation. Located in the very centre of the town, next to the former front line which has divided the town into two spheres since the war, it is one of the first schools in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina in which the integration of students from different ethnic groups was implemented, and the only such school in Mostar. , the school is attended by about 360 Bosniaks and about 290 Croats. There are two six-hour sessions a day, the first session reserved for third- and fourth- year students, and the second session for younger students. Students from both groups mingle during recess, with considerable intercommunal flirting reported. Nationalist politicians still promote the idea of segregation, with the education minister Greta Kuna declaring that \\"apples and peaches should not mix\\". = United World College = In 2006, Queen Noor of Jordan, president of the United World Colleges, opened the United World College in Mostar, which is housed on the gymnasium's third floor.

Beard, a staunch advocate of nullification while he was in North Carolina, became one of Florida's earliest secessionists. Beard claimed that with the admission of Texas to the United States, the South had enough power to break free through war. Cabell ran on the complete opposite as Beard, arguing that the Compromise of 1850 will bring peace and an end to the slavery question.

The five buildings are the oldest surviving farm buildings that are still in their original position in the country. The farm is owned and administered by Heritage New Zealand. Additionally the buildings are registered as Category I and are considered \\"historically outstanding\\". History Matanaka Farm building Matanaka Farm was founded by the Australian whaler Johnny Jones, who had bought the land and an adjoining whaling station in 1838. In April 1840, he brought out about twelve families from Sydney on the Magnet to settle the farm. The first buildings, including the stables, were built in 1840, using materials brought from Sydney. There are accounts from 1841 that mention a collection of barns and accommodation buildings, which allows researchers to date the buildings to that period. Jones himself moved into the farm's homestead in 1843. His wife, Sarah Sizemore, was said to be known as Cherry, and the nearby Cherry Farm is apparently named for her. When the settlement of Dunedin began in 1848, Jones supplied the new settlers with produce at a \\"good price\\". The Jones family moved to Dunedin for the better education opportunities for their children in 1854. Johnny Jones' son William Jones lived at Matanaka Farm until 1858, and it was passed on to the next generation, John Richard Jones and his wife Mary Orbell, who had Matanaka Farm as their home until 1871. Mary Orbell's brother, McLeod Orbell, then leased the farm until 1878. In February 1878, Matanaka Farm was sold to George McLean. In the late 1880s, McLean leased the farm to Orbell again. Ownership passed in 1892 to the farmer Alexander Bannatyne, whose family owned the farm until 1961. After brief ownership by two individuals, the farm was purchased by Monty Ericson in 1965. The Ericson family gave the Matanaka Farm buildings to the New Zealand Historic Places Trust in 1976. The setting was gazetted as an historic reserve in 1981. Heritage registration The land was gazetted as a historic reserve in 1981. The buildings were registered as Category I heritage structures by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust on 11 December 2009 with registration number 7787. The historic homestead is not included in the registration, and is not open to the public. The buildings are the oldest surviving farm buildings in New Zealand that are still in their original position.

Other acts who have passed through the doors include Green Day, Muse, Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand, Temples, Jagwar Ma, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Paramore, Oasis and My Chemical Romance. The Garage was originally the Temperance Billiard Hall which quickly gained a reputation for serving great pies, as well as being a haunt for local villains in the sixties. The Highbury Mob often used the Billiard Hall as a meeting place. The venue then became the London Town & Country Club 2, a sister venue to the Town and Country Club (now The Forum in Kentish Town), which is when the first live music events began to be programmed in the building. In 1993, the building was officially reopened as The Garage with Pulp being the first big name to play the venue in May 1993. The venue was renamed The Garage by Mean Fiddler, after the Lex Garage which was once next door. In 2007 it was taken over by MAMA & Company. Jazz Cafe and Borderline were also included in the acquisition, incorporating them in to the MAMA Group's estate from August. In June 2009, The Garage was relaunched as the Relentless Garage with joint naming rights with Relentless Energy Drinks. In 2016, the venue was taken over by DHP Family. This led to a complete revamp of the whole venue in March 2017 to create an all day bar as well as an intimate 100 capacity venue, Thousand Island, upstairs. A new layout, bar, sound and lighting system for The Garage was also added.

It is designed by DSGN Associates, EAurelio Landscape Design Inc. and JRP Design Inc. Planning In terms of historical beginnings, District II is a young Barangay compared with other barangays in the City of Cauayan with historical account that begun during the Spanish period. It was only during the second term of Ex-Mayor Tranquilino Dalupang (1956-1964) that the town proper of Cauayan was divided into \\"poblacion\\", thus creating three separate districts. Each was identified as \\"Poblacion Uno\\", \\"Poblacion Dos\\" and \\"Poblacion Tres\\", from which Barangay District II was bornhttp://cityofcauayan.gov.ph/index.php/94-65-barangay/35-brgy-district-ii SM Cauayan City is located at District II, Cauayan City, Isabela. Before SM City Cauayan was built, the Cagayan Valley region is one of the few regions on the Philippines without SM Supermall. Isabela, the richest province among the 5 provinces in the region was the prospect of the SM Management as future site of the mall. Originally, it was supposed to be built in Santiago, the commercial center of the region, in 2009, but was shelved due to undisclosed reasons. In 2011, SM Prime transferred the project to the province's second city, Cauayan City. On November 8, 2012 SM Investments Corp. has set a P65 billion capital expenditures for 2013 for future SM Malls including the SM in Cauayan City, the expanded SM Megamall and SM Aura Premier. Construction began in 2012 in the acquired lot of former Isabela Colleges, the mall was set to open in 2013 but it was moved to March 2014 and then again to May 30, 2014 making it the 49th SM Supermall in the Philippines. Location Cauayan, Isabela is the Agro-Industrial Capital of Cagayan Valley and the Central Business District of Region II where rice and corn are the main products. Millions of people residing in this region are either directly engaged in farming, food processing, and other agri- businesses yet the number of shopping centers have remained limited and scattered. According to SM Supermall, Cauayan was viewed by SM Malls as an ideal starting point in establishing the company's presence up North-East Luzon as it caters to unserved markets. SM City Cauayan is the first SM Supermall in North-Eastern Luzon, and the third SM City mall in Northern Luzon. First, being SM City Baguio in the Cordilleras, followed by SM City Rosales, in Pangasinan. Design and Construction Described by SM Supermall as its first Strip mall, SM City Cauayan holds the title as the first non-premier SM Supermall to offer al-fresco malling. The mall features a landscape that incorporates nature into the design. Ceiling fans are used to ventilate the arcaded walkways and storefront hallways, a green and cost-effective approach compared with the typical use of air conditioners. Its exterior features include warmly colored panels in random pattern combined with glass and steel finishes for a modern touch.

With Yvonne Seeley he wrote Know The Game: Mah-Jong in 1977. The book has sold over 500,000 copies and is the standard rule book for the game in Britain and the Commonwealth. Follies An enthusiast of eccentric architecture since childhood, his first book on follies,RIP the great English eccentric, Daily Telegraph, 16 June 1986Where ignorance is pretty, The Times, 19 June 1986 written with Dutch art historian , was published for the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty by Jonathan Cape in 1986.

He describes a folly as 'a misunderstood building', and elaborates on this in an introduction: \\"Ideally, [a folly] should be a big, Gothick, ostentatious, over-ambitious and useless structure, preferably with a wildly improbable local legend attached ‚Äì but in real life it must be admitted that follies defy even such broad definitions. That's half the pleasure of the things: if they could be categorised and catalogued and pinned down like specimen butterflies we would lose that frisson of excitement and mystery when another unidentified ghostly grey ruin looms up out of a wet wood. A folly is essentially a misunderstood building, because folly can only lie in the eye of the beholder.\\" Typography Headley's first essay on typography, Fabulous Fonts, was published by Pomegranate in 2001. Cassell Illustrated published his Encyclopaedia of Fonts in 2005. The author blurb described him as follows: \\"Gwyn Headley‚Äôs comfortably blurred memories of the 1960s include failing to become a rock star (despite playing with Hendrix, Clapton, Pink Floyd, the Small Faces, John Lee Hooker and others) and instead discovering a passion for typography at St. Martin‚Äôs School of Art in London‚Äôs Charing Cross Road.

Aisha was a first cousin of her husband and was a Timurid princess by birth. She was the daughter of Babur's paternal uncle, Sultan Ahmed Mirza, the King of Samarkand and Bukhara. Family and lineage Aisha Sultan Begum was born a Timurid princess and was the third daughter of Sultan Ahmed Mirza (the King of Samarkand and Bukhara) and his wife Qutaq Begum. She was probably named 'Aisha' after Prophet Muhammad's wife, ‚ÄòƒÄ‚Äôishah bint Abƒ´ Bakr. Her father, Sultan Ahmed Mirza, was the eldest son and successor of Abu Sa'id Mirza, the Emperor of the Timurid Empire. Aisha's paternal uncles included Umar Sheikh Mirza, the ruler of Ferghana Valley, who later became her father-in-law as well. His children, Babur (her future husband), and his elder sister, Khanzada Begum, were thus, Aisha's first cousins. Marriage In her infancy, Aisha was betrothed to her double first cousin, Babur, the son of Umar Sheikh Mirza and her aunt, Qutlugh Nigar Khanum. Their fathers were brothers and their mothers were sisters. The engagement happened in 1488 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, when Babur himself was only five years old. Aisha married Babur eleven years later in August 1499 at Khojand and subsequently joined him in Ferghana, where Babur had succeeded upon the death of his father as ruler of the valley of Ferghana. The young queen found her husband a bashful, if not reluctant lover. Babur remained very shy of her in the beginning of their marriage and went to see her only once in ten or fifteen days. As Babur tells it, \\"Though I was not ill-disposed towards her [Aisha], yet, this being my first marriage, out of modesty and bashfulness, I used to see her once in ten, fifteen, twenty days.\\" He soon bored even of this, and discontinued his visits altogether. Thereafter, Aisha's aunt and mother-in- law, Qutlugh Nigar Khanum, used to scold him with great fury (\\"many dunnings\\" as he says in his autobiography, translated by Annette Beveridge) and send him to visit her every few days. Babur was simply not interested in her, or in marriage, at this time. Nevertheless, Aisha gave birth to Babur's first child after three years of marriage. This was a daughter, Fakhr-un-Nissa, born in 1501 at Samarkand but died after a month or forty days. Her death grieved Babur the most as he had grown dearly fond of his little daughter. Divorce Though their relationship was much closer now, it seems that Aisha and Babur quarrelled and she left him before the overthrow of Tashkent in 1503. Babur states that his wife was misled by the machinations of her elder sister, Rabiah Sultan Begum, who induced her to leave his house.

It specializes in informational support for training, pedagogical and scientific processes. The library holds 886,000 volumes.  History of the Library  The building housing the Academy is an example of architectural art from the 18th century. It was constructed from 1766-1777 by the architect Rastrelli as a palace for the Governor-General on the site formerly belonging to the manor of Count Davier. Since 1805 and until 1958, one of the first universities in the country, the University of Kharkov (presently V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University) had been located in it. In 1958, Ukrainian Correspondence Polytechnic Institute (UCPI) was founded in this building, in accordance with Order No. 62 of the Council of Ministers of Ukraine of 24.01.1958 and Order of Ministry of Higher Education of Ukraine No. 78 of 21.02.1958. In 1990, UCPI was renamed into Kharkiv Engineering and Pedagogical Institute (KEPI), and in 1994 it was further renamed into Ukrainian Engineering and Pedagogical Academy (UEPA). The library's name was changed according to the changes in the name of the Academy itself. In 2010, according to the Decision of the Academic Council of the Academy and Rector's Order No. 166 of 01.06.2010, the library's name was finally changed into \\"UEPA Scientific Library\\". The first librarians were N. D. Shagaeva, G. M. Savchenko, L. Y. Bogatova, V. I. Sosipatrova, and others. P. S. Safronov was the first Director of the library.

Episodes Criticism and Controversy =Toyota GT86 and Subaru BRZ Reviews film= During his reviews of the Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ, Jeremy Clarkson attempted to see which one he would pick through the use of the eeny meeny miny moe rhyme. Following accusations of racism made against Clarkson for use of \\"Slope\\" comment in the Burma Special, British newspaper The Daily Mirror revealed video evidence that in his use of the rhyme with the GT86 and BRZ, he was noted as mumbling the word \\"nigger\\", which was historically a part of the rhyme's earlier versions; in the aired version of the review, the word \\"teacher\\" was used instead of the racial epithet of the unaired version that surfaced. While Clarkson denied the incident at first, he eventually issued an apology following the evidence's appearance. In his apology, he stated that he was \\"extremely keen\\" to avoid using the word, and that he had to do three takes with the film, adding that he was \\"mortified\\" that he appeared to actually mumble the word and that he did everything he could to avoid it being transmitted on the show. He further proved this was the case with a note he sent to the production office, which read: > \\"I didn't use the N-word here but I've just listened through my headphones > and it sounds like I did. Is there another take that we could use?\\", This incident was one of two reasons that led to the BBC ultimately giving Clarkson a \\"final warning\\" in regards to the corporation's views on racist remarks.

The temple's popularity as a religious place is recorded by about 1 million devotees visiting it annually. It is one of the six famous Ganesha temples on the west coast of India, which is also popularly called the \\"Ganesha Coast\\". Geography Idagunji where the temple is located is a small village on the west coast of India close to the Sharvathi River which joins the Arabian Sea. It is close to Manki, Mavinakatte and is about 14 km from Honavar, 28 km from Navilgaon, 65 km from Gokarna, and 7 km from a road which branches from the National Highway 17 (India), towards the west coast. Honnavara, the capital of the taluk in which Idagunji lies, is also the nearest railway station. Legend The importance of the temple is attributed to a legend, occurring at the end of the Dvapara Yuga (the third Hindu epoch or era) before the onset of Kali Yuga (the present epoch or era). Every one feared the advent of Kali Yuga, as the god Krishna was about to leave earth for his divine abode at the end of Dvapara Yuga. Sages started performing austerities and prayers seeking Krishna's help to overcome all impediments of Kali Yuga. Sages led by Valakhilya started rituals in Kunjavana, a forest area on the banks of the Sharavati River in Karnataka which joins the Arabian Sea. During this period, he encountered many obstacles in performing the sacrifice and was very disturbed. He, therefore, sought the advice of the divine sage Narada, seeking suitable ways to tackle the problem. Narada advised Valakhilya to seek the blessings of Ganesha - the remover of obstacles - before restarting his sacrifice. At the request of the sages, Narada selected a site for the rite on the banks of the River Sharavathi, at Kunjavana, seeking Ganesha's intervention. Even the Hindu Trinity (the gods Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) had visited this place in the past to bring an end to the demons who were involved in destroying the earth. The gods had even created the sacred lakes Chakratirtha and Brahmatirtha at that time. Narada and the other sages created a new sacred pond called Devatirtha. Narada invited the gods and requested Ganesha's mother Parvati to send Ganesha. The rites were performed and hymns recited extolled Ganesha. Pleased by their devotion, Ganesha consented to remain at the site to help them conduct the rituals without any trouble. On this occasion, one more lake was also created and named as Ganesha-tirtha to fetch water to the temple. The same location is now called the Idagunji, where the Ganesh Temple was built by the devotees around 4th-5th century CE. Central icon The central icon of the Idagunji Temple dates to 4-5th century CE. The image of Ganesha in dvibhuja style, similar to that of the Gokarna Ganesha temple, nearby Idagunji. He has two arms and is standing on a stone slab. His right hand holds a lotus bud, and he holds a modak sweet in other hand. He wears a garland across the chest in the style of a yagnopavita (sacred thread). Ganesha is adorned with a necklace of small bells. A rat, the vahana or vehicle of Ganesha, always depicted alongside Ganesha, is not depicted in this image. The image is tall and in width and is placed on stone pedestal. Worship The Idagunji Temple is one of the prominent temples in South India, independently dedicated to Ganesha. The Ganesha of Idagunji is the chief patron deity (Kuladevata) of the Havyaka Brahmins, who are Smarta by sect. Bandhis, a Dalit community of Karnataka, seek blessings of the deity, after conclusion of amicable marriage negotiations, for conduct of the marriage. The families of the bride and the groom visit the temple and perform the ritual of prasada keluvudu. A chit is placed on each of the legs of Ganesha and worship is performed. The falling of the chit of the right leg first is taken as a sign of divine approval to the marriage, however if the left chit falls first, an adverse verdict is inferred. Idagunji is part of a temple circuit of six Ganesha temples along India's western coast. The circuit starts with Kasargod, Mangalore, Anegudde, Kundapura, Idagunji and Gokarna. Any person visiting with his family all the six temples, within one day between sunrise and sunset will receive special blessings. The best puja offering that a devotee offers to Ganesha is garike grass(doorve) which is sold in the kiosks of the temple. Many other poojas can also be performed by the devotees. Souvenirs Masks made out of lavancha (sogade beru in Kannada language which is vetiver) are the souvenirs to carry as gifts from the temple. Lavancha or vetiver in the raw state gives out a pleasant scent if soaked in water and it has medicinal qualities.

He was a president of the Mathematical Association of America.MAA presidents: Arnold Dresden Background Dresden was born in Amsterdam on November 23, 1882, into a wealthy banking family. After matriculating for three years at the University of Amsterdam he used tuition money in 1903 to book passage on a ship to New York City. He then traveled to Chicago to help a friend, arriving there on his 21st birthday. Two years later, after saving money from working at various jobs, he enrolled in the graduate program at the University of Chicago, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1909 under the direction of Oskar Bolza with thesis The Second Derivatives of the Extremal Integral. Research and teaching Dresden taught at the University of Wisconsin 1909‚Äì1927. During this time he wrote several papers on the calculus of variations and systems of linear differential equations. He directed one doctoral dissertation. He was recruited to Swarthmore College by President Frank Aydelotte to initiate an honors program in mathematics that ended up being a model for other colleges and universities throughout the U.S. Dresden remained at the elite Quaker college until retiring in 1952; he was adored by many of his students. In 1935‚Äì1936 he was on sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study, where he wrote An Invitation to Mathematics.page 33, Publications of members, 1930‚Äì1954 Libraries, Institute for Advanced StudySearch on \\"Arnold Dresden\\" to find directory listing for Arnold Dresden as a Visiting Member of the Institute for Advanced Study. He died on April 10, 1954 in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, at age 71. While at Wisconsin Arnold Dresden was active in and served as secretary of, the Chicago Section of the American Mathematical Society. A charter member of the Mathematical Association of America, he was elected President for 1933‚Äì1934. He also served as Vice- President during 1931 and as a member of the Board of Governors for 1935‚Äì1940 and 1943‚Äì1945. His retiring presidential address, ‚ÄúA program for mathematics,‚Äù encapsulated his deep concern about the place of mathematics in general culture and about the mathematical community's laissez-faire attitude toward the role it should play. A recurring theme was his belief that abstract concepts can be grasped by young people, which he preached in his 1936 book, An Invitation to Mathematics. He was also known as an ally to women in the field, as well. He also wrote three textbooks and translated van der Waerden‚Äôs classic Science Awakening from Dutch into English.

His professional career began in 2009 with an autobiographical novel The Mexican Chronicles, describing the journey across Mexico from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea. Since then Kidruk traveled in 29 countries and wrote eight fiction books including travelogues, adventure stories and thrillers. He is the author of the very first Ukrainian techno-thriller Bot. Most of his stories are based on real places and events which Kidruk witnessed or heard of from fellow travelers during his journeys. From 2012, he has been working solely in the techno-thriller genre. thumb  Life  Kidruk was born on 1 April 1984 in Volodymyrets, a small town in western Ukraine (Rivne region). In 2006 he graduated from National University of Water Management and Natural Resources Use (located in Rivne city) receiving a MSc in Engineering. While at the university Kidruk also worked as a programmer in Russian Developers Company ASCON. After graduating Kidruk moved to Kyiv, and became a PhD student at National Technical University \\"Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\\". thumb In 2007 Kidruk obtained a Swedish Institute scholarship, and moved to Stockholm. He studied Sustainable Development at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan ‚Äî KTH), one of the leading technical universities in Europe at the time. In the following 2 years Kidruk lived in Europe, gradually moving away from science toward literature. During the summer of 2008 Kidruk started his first big journey overseas, flying to Mexico and crossing the country from the western to eastern coast with a small backpack and little money. The adventures on the trip formed the core of his first published book, The Mexican Chronicles. The book becomes an instant success in Ukraine (the first edition sold out within 6 months, during the next 3 years the book was reissued 3 times), and Kidruk decided to leave his science career and focus on literature. Kidruk's next big trip to South America and Easter Island developed into his second travel book The Journey to the Navel of the World, published in 2010. The book was also successful (the second edition appeared in 2012). During 2010‚Äì2012 Kidruk visited Angola, Namibia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Brazil, China, Turkey, Norway, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, New Zealand, Italy, France and others, in total almost 30 countries. He accidentally became a witness of the Egyptian uprising in 2011, staying two weeks on Tahrir square surrounded by Arabs protesting against President Mubarak. Later in 2011 Kidruk organized a response to a sexually harassing \\"Win a Ukrainian Wife\\" competition launched by New Zealand's The Rock Fm radio station (the action took place in Auckland, New Zealand, it is described in an autobiographical book To New Zealand!). In 2012 Kidruk published techno-thriller Bot, a story based on programming, nanotechnologies and mysteries of a human brain. This work was very successful. The first edition of Bot sold out in 3 months. The book entered \\"Knyharnya Ye\\" bookstore chart at number sixteen, reaching number two in just two weeks, and staying in the top ten for twelve weeks. Bot is being translated into Russian, Polish and German. In September 2013 techno-thriller The Stronghold was published.

The Guiyi Circuit was controlled by the Zhang family from the second half of the 8th century to the 10th century and then the Cao family until the 11th century.

In 848 Zhang Yichao, a resident of Shazhou Prefecture, led an uprising and captured Shazhou and Guazhou prefectures from the Tibetans. By 850 Zhang had captured Ganzhou, Suzhou, and Yizhou prefectures. Zhang claimed the title of acting prefect of Shazhou and submitted a petition to Emperor XuƒÅnzong of Tang, offering his loyalty and submission. In 851 Zhang captured Xizhou Prefecture (Gaochang). Envoys from Shazhou prefecture reached the Tang court and the emperor responded by naming Zhang's territory the Guiyi Circuit and made Zhang Yichao the Guiyi Jiedushi (Ê≠∏Áæ©ÁØÄÂ∫¶‰Ωø, Governor of the Guiyi Circuit) and Cao Yijin his secretary general. By 861 the Guiyi Circuit had extended its authority to Guazhou, Ganzhou, Suzhou, Yizhou, Lanzhou, Shanzhou, Hezhou, Minzhou, Liangzhou, and Kuozhou prefectures. In 866 Zhang Yichao defeated the Tibetan general bLon Khrom brZhe (:zh:Ë´ñÊÅêÁÜ±) and seized Luntai (√úr√ºmqi) and Tingzhou Prefecture. However they were immediately captured by the Kingdom of Qocho afterwards. Xizhou Prefecture (Gaochang) was also captured by the Uyghurs. In 867 Zhang Yichao departed for the Tang court after his brother Yitan died. His nephew Zhang Huaishen succeeded him as Guiyi Jiedushi. In 869 the Kingdom of Qocho (Xizhou Uyghurs) attacked the Guiyi Circuit but was repelled. In 870 the Kingdom of Qocho attacked the Guiyi Circuit but was repelled. In 872 Zhang Yichao died at court. In 876 the Kingdom of Qocho seized Yizhou Prefecture. Around the years 881 and 882, Gan and Liang prefectures slipped from the control of the Guiyi Circuit. The Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom would establish itself in Ganzhou Prefecture by 894. In Liang prefecture the Tibetan state of Xiliangfu established itself by 906. In 890 Zhang Huaishen was assassinated and his cousin Zhang Huaiding succeeded him. In 892 Zhang Huaiding died and left his son in the care of Suo Xun (Á¥¢Âã≥), son-in-law of Zhang Yichao. Suo Xun declared himself Guiyi Jiedushi. In 894 Suo Xun was killed by a local aristocrat by the name of Li Mingzhen and Zhang Yichao's daughter. Li's sons shared control of Guiyi Circuit afterwards. In 896 Li Mingzhen's sons were ousted and Zhang Chengfeng (ÂºµÊâøÂ•â), a grandson of Zhang Yichao, became jiedushi.

Sogdians of Dunhuang  A Tang Dynasty sancai Chinese ceramic statuette of a Sogdian merchant riding on a Bactrian camel, a common pack animal on the eastern end of the Silk Road During the Tang and subsequent Five Dynasties and Song Dynasty, large communities of Sogdians lived in China, especially in the multicultural entrep√¥t of Dunhuang, Gansu, a major center of Buddhist learning and home to the Buddhist Mogao Caves.Galambos, Imre (2015), \\"She Association Circulars from Dunhuang\\", in Antje Richter, A History of Chinese Letters and Epistolary Culture, Brill: Leiden, Boston, pp 870-71. While the region occasionally fell under the rule of different states (the Tang, the Tibetan Empire, and later the Western Xia led by the Tanguts), it retained its multilingual nature as evidenced by an abundance of manuscripts (religious and secular) in Chinese and Tibetan, but also Sogdian, Khotanese (another Eastern Iranian language native to the region), Uyghur, and Sanskrit.Galambos, Imre (2015), \\"She Association Circulars from Dunhuang\\", in Antje Richter, A History of Chinese Letters and Epistolary Culture, Brill: Leiden, Boston, p 871.

Of these the most common Sogdian surname throughout China was Shi (i.e. Áü≥), whereas the surnames Shi (i.e. Âè≤), An, Mi (i.e. Á±≥), Kang, Cao, and He appear frequently in Dunhuang manuscripts and registers.Galambos, Imre (2015), \\"She Association Circulars from Dunhuang\\", in Antje Richter, A History of Chinese Letters and Epistolary Culture, Brill: Leiden, Boston, p. 872. The influence of Sinicized and multilingual Sogdians during this Guiyijun (Ê≠∏Áæ©Ëªç) period (c. 850 - c. 1000 AD) of Dunhuang is evident in a large number of manuscripts written in Chinese characters from left to right instead of vertically, mirroring the direction of how the Sogdian alphabet is read.Galambos, Imre (2015), \\"She Association Circulars from Dunhuang\\", in Antje Richter, A History of Chinese Letters and Epistolary Culture, Brill: Leiden, Boston, pp 870, 873.

It was heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal on November 5, 2009, with judgment handed down on December 3. Mpati P, Brand JA, Snyders JA, Malan JA and Bosielo JA presided. Counsel for the appellants was BC Wharton; CHJ Maree appeared for the respondent in case No. 483/08 and M. Verster for the respondent in case No. 007/09. These were appeals from two decisions in the High Court, Cape Town. The appellants' attorneys were RP Totos, Cape Town, and Symington & De Kok, Bloemfontein. The respondent's attorneys in case No. 483/08 were Van der Spuy & Vennote, Cape Town, and Phatshoane Henney Ing, Bloemfontein. The respondent's attorneys in case No. 007/09 were JC Van der Berg Attorneys, George, and Hill, McHardy & Herbst Ing, Bloemfontein. In two cases of unlawful occupation of land, and actions for statutory eviction from such land, the notice requirements of the Magistrates' Courts came under scrutiny. The Magistrates' Courts Rules compel a procedure differing from that in the High Court. Bosielo JA, however, found that, as long as the notice achieves the general purpose contemplated by the Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land ActAct 19 of 1998.s 4. (PIE) and the Magistrates' Courts Rules,Rule 55. the fact that the notice does not strictly comply with such provisions is not necessarily fatal; in other words, two notices in two separate documents were not required.  Facts  In the High Court, eviction procedure under PIE is determined by section 4 of that legislation, as well as by the Uniform Rules of the High Court. The combined effect of these statutory provisions is explained in Cape Killarney Property Investments v Mahamba.2001 (4) SA 1222 (SCA). The procedure in the Magistrates' Courts is different from that in the High Court, because of the difference in the provisions of Rule 55 of the Magistrates' Courts Rules, on the one hand, from those of Rule 6 of the Uniform Rules of the High Court, on the other. In the Magistrates' Court, two notices contained in two separate documents are not required. One will suffice as long as # the content of the document and the manner of service are approved by the Magistrates' Court with jurisdiction, as envisaged by section 4(2) of PIE, pursuant to a preceding ex parte application; # the contents of the document comply with the provisions of section 4(5) of PIE, with Rule 55 of the Magistrates' Courts Rules and the court order under (1); and # the document is served on the respondent and the municipality concerned in accordance with section 4(2) of PIE, the Magistrates' Courts Rules pertaining to service and the court order under (1).  Judgment  When considering the order to be granted in terms the procedure above, held Bosielo JA (Mpati P, Brand JA, Snyders JA and Malan JA concurring), the court is obliged to ensure that the notice will be \\"effective\\" in the circumstances of the case, having regard to the intent and import of PIE and section 26(3) of the Constitution. The fact that the notice served on the respondent is in some respect deficient of section 4(2) or Rule 55 (as it was in both cases here) will not necessarily be fatal if the notice achieved the purpose contemplated by these statutory provisions. Whether that purpose had been achieved cannot be considered in the abstract, but will depend on the facts of each case.Para 15.

The Mount Taylor period lasted from approximately 5000 or 4000 BCE to 2000 BCE. Most archaeological sites associated with the culture are in the middle and upper parts of the St. Johns River valley, with related sites occurring along the east coast of Florida, and at a few other places in Florida. The Mount Taylor culture emerged from the regionally undifferentiated middle Archaic culture in Florida, and was succeeded by the late Archaic Orange period. The Mount Taylor period is named after the Mount Taylor site (8VO19), a large shell midden on the St. Johns River in northwestern Volusia County, Florida. The absence of ceramics in the lowest levels of the Mount Taylor midden was noted in the late 19th century by C. B. Moore. Archaeologists working in the first half of the 20th century established that ceramic‚Äëfree layers existed in many middens and mounds in eastern Florida. John Goggin defined the Mount Taylor period to cover a number of middens and mounds in northeastern Florida that lacked ceramics, but had similar artifact assemblages. Later workers have set 5000 to 4000 BCE as the beginning of the period. The appearance of fiber-tempered ceramics in eastern Florida around 4000 BCE is conventionally taken as marking the end of the Mount Taylor period and the beginning of the Orange period.Milanich: 88-89, 246Wheeler, et al.: 142-43 Wheeler, et al. identify about 50 sites in the middle and upper St. Johns River valley and the Oklawaha River valley as past of the Mount Taylor period. Another dozen sites around the mouth of the St. Johns River and on coastal lagoons, and a few inland sites, appear to be related to the Mount Taylor period. With few exceptions, dates for coastal sites are confined to the late part of the Mount Taylor period. Sea levels rose quickly during the Mount Taylor period, from about seven meters below 20th century levels about 7,000 14C years ago to close to current levels 6,000 years ago (sea levels have been both higher and lower than that in the last 6,000 14C years). Coastal sites from early in the Mount Taylor period may have been drowned or destroyed by the rising sea waters.Beasley: 84-85Wheeler, et al.: 143, 145-46. Freshwater shellfish were a staple in the diet of the people inhabiting Mount Taylor sites in the St. Johns River valley. Up to 99% of the volume of many Mount Taylor period middens consists of snail shells (including river snails and apple snails). Freshwater mussels were also consumed, and mussel shells are the primary component of some Mount Taylor middens. The snail shells deposited in individual Mount Taylor middens decreased in size over time, indicating that consumption outpaced natural increase. The communities probably relocated to new sites when the size of harvested snails dropped too low. Coastal sites related to the Mount Taylor period have middens consisting primarily of oyster and coquina shells, with some dwarf surf clam shells.Milanich: 90-92Wheeler, et al.: 132-33, 135, 137 Burials in mounds from the later part of the Mount Taylor period have been found in several sites dating 4,600 to 5,600 years ago (Beasley has proposed separating a Thornhill Lake period from the Mount Taylor period to recognize this development). These burials mounds are among the oldest known in Florida.Beasley: 61-62 Notes References  Category:Archaeological cultures of North America ","title":"Mount Taylor period"},{"id":"38373261","text":"Ali Murad Khan Kalhoro, was a Chief of the Kalhora tribe from 1880 - 1925.

It assesses the extent to which respondents expect negative societal beliefs, feelings, and behaviors towards people who are supposed to have a mental disorder.  The construct  Perceived mental illness stigma is a psychological construct. It is a key component of the modified labeling theory. According to this theory, negative societal beliefs about people with mental disorders are part of western culture (e.g. people with mental disorders are seen as being less trustworthy, weak, less intelligent, and dangerous). As a product of socialization, individuals familiarize themselves with these beliefs, and - to a certain degree - expect negative attitudes, feelings and behaviors towards people with mental disorders (for example rejection when applying for a job, or reluctance to enter into a close relationship).  The questionnaire  The Stig-9 questionnaire consists of nine items and one example item. On a four-point Likert scale, respondents indicate the degree to which they expect negative societal beliefs, feelings, and behaviors towards someone who has been treated for a mental disorder. Response categories are: * disagree [0] * somewhat disagree [1] * somewhat agree [2] * agree [3] The item responses are summarized in a sum score (range 0-27 points). \\"High scores on Stig-9 correspond with high expectations of negative societal beliefs, feelings, and behaviors towards 'mentally ill' people.\\"  Psychometric properties  The psychometric properties were analyzed in a study conducted at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany. The authors surveyed a large clinical sample of approximately 1,000 patients at the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy. They found excellent item- and scale characteristics, high internal consistency, and evidence for validity. In addition, they determined reference scores for the study population.

Together with his wife, Linda Murray, he wrote primers on Italian Renaissance art which have been used by generations of students. In 1959 they published the highly successful Penguin Dictionary of Art and Artists, which was frequently updated and reissued. In 1963, they published two substantial introductory texts The Art of the Renaissance, and a book that became a classic primer The Architecture of the Renaissance. Linda also wrote several books on her own, and completed their collaboration The Oxford Companion To Christian Art And Architecture (1996) after Peter died.  Early life and education  Murray was born in 1920 in London. His parents were John Knowles Murray, an agricultural businessman, and Dorothy Catton (Murray). He went to King Edward VI School, Birmingham and Robert Gordon's College, Aberdeen. He trained as a painter at Gray's School of Art, Aberdeen and at the Slade School of Fine Art, University of London, graduating in 1940. Murray studied history of art at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, graduating in 1947. It was here that he met his wife, fellow student Linda Bramley (1913‚Äì2004). They married in 1947.  Academic career  Murray lectured at the Courtauld Institute and Birkbeck College from 1948, while working on his PhD on the textual sources of Giotto's work. He received his PhD from the Courtauld Institute in 1956. In 1952, he became the librarian of the Witt Library at the Courtauld Institute (leaving this position in 1964) and in 1961 he was made senior research fellow at the college. Murray moved to Birkbeck College, London in 1967 as Professor of Art History, succeeding Nikolaus Pevsner. He established history of art as an undergraduate discipline at the college, the subject previously having been taught outside the college's departmental structure. Murray retired as professor emeritus in 1980 and was succeeded by John Steer. He was a gifted linguist, especially in German and Italian, and translated seminal art history texts into English, including Klassische Kunst, by Heinrich W√∂lfflin in 1952 and Die Geschichte der Renaissance by Jacob Burckhardt in 1985. He was the president of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain from 1969 to 1972, and the chairman of the Walpole Society from 1978 to 1981.  Murray Bequest  After his death in 1992 (Farnborough, Wiltshire) , Linda Murray established the Murray Bequest at Birkbeck College. It funds support for students and research travel, as well as the Murray Research Studentship for part-time PhD research in the field of European art or architecture in the Middle Ages or Renaissance. It also funds the biennial Murray Memorial Lecture.  Photography  Photographs by Peter Murray are held in the Conway Library at the Courtauld Institute of Art and are currently being digitised.

His greatest hit song was \\"Ben ik te min\\" (\\"Am I not good enough?\\"). Armand came to the fore during the hippie generation and was well known as an advocate of cannabis. Biography His great examples were Bob Dylan, Peter Seeger and Woody Guhrthie. Arand, ex- member and fonder of the Shannonboys, Les Gilets. He launched his first solo- record in 1965. \\"En nou ik\\" which flopped, but he didn't give up. Then the record \\"En een van hem ben ik\\" came out, which made it to the \\"Tipparade\\", but then 3 months afterwards the B side (Ben ik te min) became a national hit. He stayed in the Dutch Top 40's for 14 weeks with this record. In that same year the single \\"Blommenkinders\\" came out. This brought him in the Top40's, reaching a high of number 19. From here on, the record label Philips refusesed to release \\"Lijpe Harrie\\", from where on Armand decided to write the debut song for Lenny Kuhr (\\"Laat maar schrijven\\"). Ten years later Armand released \\"Lijpe Harrie\\" after all. Because Armand was a great advocate of legalising soft drugs and Philips declined to publish lyrics about that subject, he transferred in 1970 to Telstar Records (then owned by Dutch singer Johnny Hoes). On the label Kilroy he released six albums in the period of 1971 to 1981. The albums contained many socially concerned lyrics, most of them inspired by the hippie ideology of the late 1960s. In 1990 he broke with the majors to give himself more artistic freedom. In 1994 he released \\"One of Our Kind\\", which was only for sale at his gigs. In 1996 he celebrated his 50th birthday by bringing out the double CD \\"50 jaar Armand\\". The album \\"A Tribute to Armand/50 years and still in the Highlife\\" followed. On 14 December 2011 Armand was the first Dutch hippie artist to participate in the TV show hosted by Ali B called \\"Op Volle Toeren\\". He recorded his own version of the song \\"Straattaal\\", originated by the rapper Nina, who-in turn-recorded her version of Armand's song \\"Ben ik te min\\". Armand revived his music career in 2011, performing on rapper Ali B's TV show Ali B op volle toeren. An adaptation of \\"Ben ik te min\\" was released with rapper Nina having updated the lyrics: in this version (with Ali B and Brownie Dutch), the song talks of the disrespect for women Nina finds in hip hop culture. In 2012, Armand began a collaboration with singer-songwriter Lucky Fonz III and Dave von Raven (singer for The Kik), both fans of his, and in June 2015 Armand & The Kik released an album with adaptations of Armand's lesser-known songs, followed by a Dutch tour.

The main monastery building dates from around the 13th century. History The Trappist abbey was founded in the early nineteenth century. In 1815, after twenty years of exile due to the suppression of religious orders by Napoleon, the Trappists returned to work in France. More precisely, on February 21, 1815, a Trappist community under Dom Bernard de Girmont, later their first abbot, settled in the empty buildings of a former priory occupied by a community of canons, dissolved during the French Revolution. The new community was formally recognised as an abbey on December 10, 1816, by Pope Pius VII. =Present day= Today, in addition to the conventual buildings, the abbey church and the beautiful chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, the abbey has a house for pilgrims with about 30 rooms and a small shop at the entrance selling religious books and the produce of the monks: jam, honey, biscuits, cakes. There is also at the abbey entrance a small external house for pilgrims, in case of emergency arrivals at night. Column of Notre Dame du Triomphe At the beginning of the 20th century at least 100 monks lived here, but today there are only 12. = Notre Dame du Triomphe = Behind the abbey is a little hill with a beautiful wild garden. A path leads to the column of Notre Dame du Triomphe (Our Lady of Triumph), a column on which there is a statue of the Virgin Mary overlooking the landscape. According to a plaque, all those who recite three Hail Marys are granted 100 days of indulgence, as determined by Pope Pius IX.

Embassy of Japan in Iran, 25 Dec 2012. Soleiman Mehdizadeh (, ; born 1955) is an Iranian master of Bud≈ç. Biography He traveled to Japan in 1977, to Tokyo, and started practicing Kendo. After a while he returned to Iran; but, again, in 1978, he went to Japan and in Nishiyama's Dojo practiced Kendo. He also learned Iaido from Totsuka and Goju-ryu Karate under Yamamoto. Foundation history: Kendo & Iaido in Iran The teaching of the traditional martial art of Kendo-Iaido in Iran was founded by Soleiman Mehdizadeh. In 1980, the International Martial Arts Federation started supervising Kendo & Iaido (Samurai). The formal training, which was under the control of Mehdizadeh, was in the Fencing Hall (Martial Arts Hall at the time). In the same year the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) prepared a film about the first samurai martial arts training class in Iran and then broadcast it on Jan. 6th 1983. Simultaneously Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) filmed a documentary showing martial arts exercises demonstrated by Mehdizadeh. Since Mehdizadeh had to stay in Japan for several months each year, for follow-up technical and specialty exercises, his masters advised him to reside in Japan, in order to pass higher level exams in Kendo-Iaido. Returning to Iran in 1994, Mehdizadeh recommenced training of students, under the supervision of the Karate Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

G. \\"Flip\\" Carli (1879‚Äì1972) was a footballer turned film director from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Biography Carli was born in Bandung, West Java, in 1879. His father was a major in the Dutch military of Italian descent, while his mother was native. Carli went to the Netherlands around age seven, where he completed his education. As a youth he expressed an interest in football, playing for his school team. He later acquired the nickname \\"Flip\\". In 1901, soon after graduation, Carli returned to the Indies and took a job at a sugar factory. Although he remained active in football, around this time he took up an interest in photography. He eventually moved to the colony's capital at Batavia (now Jakarta) to open his own photography shop. By 1919 Carli had become interested in filmmaking, establishing his own company in Bandung named Kinowerk Carli to make documentaries. His first success, and his most popular documentary, followed the 1919 eruption of Mount Kelud in East Java. He later made a film promoting the Post Savings Bank. In 1925 he planned to make another documentary film covering a night fair in Bandung, but he ultimately was unable to do so; his permit was revoked and the contract went to a foreign director. His last recorded documentary showed a rectory in Bandung. During a 1926 polemic between several newspapers in the Indies, Carli expressed his belief that locally produced films would be able to compete with works produced professionally in the United States and Europe. He followed this by directing De Stem des Bloeds (The Voice of Blood), a film which follows a man and his mistress who reunite after their son and step-daughter unwittingly fall in love. Although the film was shot in black-and-white, Carli tinted some scenes entirely in one colour; this gave an effect which one reviewer likened to seeing farmers working at dusk. The film, targeted at Dutch audiences, was reportedly a commercial success, although critical reception was mixed. Around this time he had married Annie Krohn, a mixed-race actress who had starred in De Stem des Bloeds. Two years later, Carli released his second theatrical work. Entitled Karina's Zelfopoffering (Karina's Sacrifice), the film starred Carli's wife Annie as a mixed-race woman living at the palace in Yogyakarta. This film was not successful, and soon afterwards Carli returned to the Netherlands. He died in 1972.

Warren Remedy, (1905-1912), was a Best in Show winner of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1907, 1908, and 1909. She was a Smooth-coated fox terrier owned by Winthrop Rutherfurd, and is the only dog to have won Westminster three years in a row. Early life Remedy was sired by Sabine Resist from Routon Dainty. She was bred by Winthrop Rutherfurd, and brought up at the Warren Kennels in Allamuchy Township, New Jersey. Other dogs which were bred from the same pairing included Warren Drastic, Warren Deputy, Warren Vogue and Warren Rescue. Show career The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show introduced a Best in Show competition in 1907, the first since the show's inception in 1877. At the age of 20 months, Warren Remedy was entered in the competition and progressed through breed and group victories into the Best in Show round. She faced off against sixteen other breeds of dogs. These included the Rough Collie Squire of Tytton, who had won the Van Schaick Cup earlier in the show, and the English Sheepdog Dolly Gray, who won the Castle Gould Cup. Ten judges preceded over the Best in Show round and awarded the title to Warren Remedy. Immediately afterwards, Remedy competed once again at the show, this time for Ballyhoo Bay Challenge Cup awarded by the Ladies Kennel Association of America. A similar lineup of dogs competed for the trophy, with the exception of Squire of Tytton being replaced with the American-bred Rough Collie Mountaineer Magistrate. Remedy was expected to win this title as well, but it was instead awarded to the English Setter Deodora Prince. Later in the 1907 show season, Remedy was named Best in Show at the inaugural North Jersey Kennel Club dog show. A week after that victory and also in New Jersey, Remedy also won the award for the best dog or bitch in show at the Asbury Park dog show. Remedy retained the Best in Show title at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1908, and afterwards was declared to be the \\"best dog of her kind in America\\". Later in 1908, Remedy was named the best bitch in the show at the Ladies Kennel Association of America show held in Mineola, New York. She won Westminster once again in 1909, although reports mistakenly gave her name as \\"Warren Rutherford\\". Following her victory at Westminster in 1909, Remedy competed in the New England Kennel Club Show later in the same month. There she was defeated by the Smooth Fox Terrier Sabine Fernie from the Sabine Kennels. At the 1910 Westminster Show, Remedy was defeated in what was viewed as a surprise victory in the best Smooth Fox Terrier bitch contest by Sabine Fernie. Fernie went on to be defeated by fellow Sabine Kennel's dog, Sabine Rarebit in the best overall Smooth Fox Terrier contest. Rarebit went on to win the Best in Show title, the first time it had been awarded to a dog other than Warren Remedy. Warren Remedy's death was reported by The New York Times on December 17, 1912. She died in the Warren Kennels on Winthrop Rutherfurd's farm in Allamuchy Township. Legacy Warren Remedy remains the only dog to have won Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on three occasions, the most victories by any single dog. Bronze statues were later crafted of Remedy's form by Ric Chashoudian. These statues were used as awards to show dog owners for a series of awards by the Westminster Kennel Club.

He served as the inspector in the Hoeryong region in 1866 and led the army of Ganghwado Island against the United States military during the U.S. expedition to Korea in 1871. Eo Jae-yeon was born in 1823. His father's name was Eo Yong-In. In 1841, at eighteen years of age, Eo Jae-yeon passed the military service examination, which was arranged at Ganghwado Island. In 1866, Eo Jae-yeon and his troops were able to defend the Gwangsung camp from French troops invading Ganghwado Island during the French campaign against Korea (1866). He was then appointed the minister of Hoeryong, where, among other successes, he was able to suppress a band of marauders. He also constructed a market in Hoeryong and revitalized border trade with the Qing dynasty. When the American Asiatic Rogers' Squadron arrived on the coast of the island in 1871, the royal council appointed Eo Jae-yeon to serve as the Commandant. He exerted himself in this duty, and he and his brother, Eo Jae-sun, were killed by U.S. Marines during the military action. He was posthumously appointed the Minister of War. During the war, Eo Jae-yeon's flag, 'Sujagi' was taken by the American Squadron. United States expedition to Korea On May 16, 1871, five U.S. warships departed from Nagasaki, Japan to Ganghwado Island, carrying about 1,230 Marines and 85 cannons. The fundamental aim of the expedition was not full-scale war: but gunboat diplomacy. About 240 Joseon soldiers were killed, 100 were drowned, and 20 were captured, whereas only three of the U.S. Marines were killed and ten were injured. However, the U.S. forces could not achieve their original purpose of establishing a treaty for protection of the shipwrecked mariners, along with a possible trade treaty; and thus, they departed to the Chinese mainland. During the United States expedition to Korea, Eo Jae-yeon had burned his bridges behind the Gwangsung camp with his six hundred troops. Eo had fought unsupported against the full-scale offensive by the United States. To defend against the United States' amphibious attack, Eo retaliated with cannon fire and fought to his death without retreating. The Marine who killed him, Private James Dougherty, was subsequently given the Medal of Honor. In the (), a book of Hwang-hyeon, there is a record that 'Eo fought with his enemy using his sword. Even when Eo‚Äôs sword broke, he kept fighting by throwing a lead bullet at the enemy. In the end, however, Eo Jae- yeon was stabbed to death by his enemy's spear and the enemy took Eo's head.' This record describes the desperate situation of the United States expedition to Korea. Eo Jae-yeon's flag, the \\"Sujagi\\" Eo Jae-Yeon's flag, the Sujagi. Believed to be constructed of hemp or cotton and measuring approximately 4.15m x 4.35m, the rank flag 'Sujagi' bearing the Chinese character for \\"commanding general‚Äù was captured as a war trophy in 1871 when American troops seized Ganghwa Island during the U.S. Expedition to Korea. Restored in 1913, the flag was returned to the South Korean Cultural Heritage Administration in 2007 on a 10-year loan from the U.S. Naval Academy Museum, which has had possession for over 130 years.

Other mill finishes are surprisingly smooth and uniform. It is possible for a mill to influence the finish of produced stock.

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as legal counsel and chief of staff to Governor Deval Patrick. Patrick appointed him on an interim basis to fill the vacancy left by fellow Democrat John Kerry, who resigned to become U.S. Secretary of State. Cowan declined to run in the 2013 special election to complete the remainder of Kerry's term. He was succeeded by fellow Democrat Ed Markey. Cowan was the eighth African- American U.S. Senator and the second from Massachusetts after Edward Brooke. He was one of three African-American U.S. Senators in the 113th Congress, along with Republican Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina and Democrat Cory Booker from New Jersey, although he did not serve alongside Booker, who took office on October 31, 2013. Early life and education Cowan was born on April 4, 1969, in rural Yadkinville, North Carolina, the son of a machinist and a seamstress. His father died when he was 16 years old. Cowan graduated from Forbush High School. Originally planning to become a doctor, he graduated from Duke University in 1991 with a degree in sociology. Cowan went on to earn his Juris Doctor from Northeastern University School of Law in 1994. His assignments in Northeastern's cooperative program, which provides students with work experience as part of its educational program, included stints in the office of a state trial court, at North Carolina Prison Legal Services, and with the Palm Beach County Public Defender‚Äôs Office. Professional career In 1997, Cowan joined the law firm of Mintz Levin as an associate. There he practiced civil litigation and became a partner. He helped Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney identify African-American candidates for judgeships after Romney was criticized for lack of diversity among his appointees. Cowan left Mintz Levin to join Deval Patrick's administration in 2009. As Patrick's counsel, Cowan was responsible for the legal operations of the executive branch and oversaw the governor's judicial nominations, including that of Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court Roderick L. Ireland. His principal projects as staff included legislation to contain the growth of health care costs and to expand gaming, as well as investigating and reorganizing the state Parole Board. Cowan served as Patrick's chief legal counsel for two years and then as chief of staff from January 2011 until November 2012, when he announced plans to return to the private sector. He continued to serve the governor as a senior adviser until his Senate appointment. When appointed to the Senate, he said he had no intention of seeking public office once his interim appointment expired. He said: \\"This is going to be a very short political career. I am not running for office. I'm not a candidate for public service at any time today or in the future.\\" In 2003, Boston Business Journal named him to its list of \\"40 under 40\\", a select group of younger business and civic leaders. He is the former president of the Massachusetts Black Lawyers Association and the Northeastern Law School Alumni Association. He serves on the Board of Trustees of Northeastern University. Other non-profit boards he has served on include the Discovering Justice Foundation, Roxbury Preparatory Charter School, the Chestnut Hill School, and Project STEP. U.S. Senate =Tenure= Cowan (right) with U.S. Representative Ed Markey (left), his successor in the Senate, at a 2013 gathering In December 2012, President Barack Obama announced the nomination of U.S. Senator and Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry to serve as Secretary of State, leaving a vacancy in the seat Kerry had held for 28 years. Under state law, the House of Representatives grants the governor of Massachusetts the right to fill vacant U.S. Senate seats with an interim appointment. Governor Deval Patrick announced that he was looking at \\"out of the box candidates\\" who had never run for office, and would hold the seat temporarily, forgoing a run in the special election. On January 30, 2013, Patrick announced the appointment of Cowan to the seat. Cowan became Massachusetts's second African-American U.S. Senator after Edward Brooke.

Its chief function is to establish uniform minimum standard of basic and higher qualifications in medicine and dentistry throughout Pakistan by controlling entry to the PMC register of medical practitioners within Pakistan and suspending or removing members when necessary. It also sets the education standards for Medical Colleges in Pakistan along with the Higher Education Commission.http://www.pmdc.org.pk/AboutUs/tabid/72/Default.aspx History The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council was initially established as Pakistan Medical Council in 1948 by adopting the British Indian Medical Council Act 1933 on the recommendations of the 1947 Pakistan Health Conference. It was later reorganized under the Pakistan Medical Council Act 1951 whereby each province has its own medical council. In 1957, the West Pakistan Medical Council was formed by merging the Sindh Medical Council and the Punjab Medical Council. The Pakistan Medical Council Ordinance 1962 established the present- day Pakistan Medical and Dental Council as a statutory body in 1962 and all provincial councils were dissolved. Three amendments were passed thereafter as the Medical and Dental Council (Amendment) Act in 1973, 1999 and 2012.The Medical and Dental Council (Amendment) Act, 2012 Purpose The council has been mandated to regulate the practice of medicine and dentistry in Pakistan by: *Prescribing a uniform minimum standard of courses of training for obtaining undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental qualifications *Prescribing minimum requirements for the content and duration of undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses of study *Prescribing the conditions for admission of courses of training as aforesaid *Prescribing minimum qualification and experience required of teachers for appointment in medical and dental institutions *Prescribing the standards of examinations, methods of conducting the examinations *Prescribing the qualifications and experience required of examiners for professional examinations *Registering faculty and students of all medical and dental institutions *Maintaining the Register of Medical and Dental Practitioners *Inspecting and formulate recommendations regarding recognition of medical and dental institutions for training of undergraduate and postgraduate qualification *Inspecting undergraduate and postgraduate examination for standardization *Deciding cases against registered practitioners for conduct and professional negligence *Inspecting and approve hospitals for house job and training *Prescribing guidelines for medical and dental journals *Issuing experience certificates to faculty *Setting up schemes of reciprocity with other countries and medical and dental regulatory authorities Registration All medical and dental practitioners and students are required to register with the council to legally practice medicine and dentistry in Pakistan. The guidelines for registration are outlined under Chapter IX, Pakistan Registration of Medical and Dental Practitioners Regulations, 2008. Criticism Several corruption allegations and scandals have been associated with the council. In particular, irregularities in the registration of medical and dental colleges and allegations of wrongdoing in the accreditation of doctors have also been leveled in judicial probes of the council's affairs. A judicial commission was set up under a court order after allegations of embezzlement in the registration of private medical and dental colleges in 2013. The commission was headed by the former Lahore High Court judge Shabbar Raza Rizvi who concluded that top Ministry officials and influential members of the Executive Committee of PMDC were responsible for the irregularities. Mr. Ali Raza Advocate and Vice President of PMC championed the irregularities under the auspices of Council headed by Dr. Burki. Represen¬≠tatives of various medical organizations have expressed their concerns regarding PMC that it will give autonomy to private medical colleges for fixing their fee increasing burden on students. Dissolution and Restoration In October 2019, the PMDC was dissolved and replaced by the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) following President Arif Alvi signing of the Pakistan Medical Commission Ordinance 2019. The move was done in order to regulate and control the medical profession in Pakistan by establishing uniform minimum standards of medical education, training, and recognition of qualifications in medicine and dentistry. For this to occur, it was argued that PMDC had to be dissolved first in order to properly implement the new ordinance. PMDC offices were temporarily sealed to ensure the protection of essential records and assets. The new PMC would consist of the existing Medical and Dental Council, the National Medical and Dental Academic Board and the National Medical Authority, which would act as a Secretariat of the Commission. On 11 February 2020, the Islamabad High Court nullified the Pakistan Medical Commission Ordinance and restored PMDC. On 16 September 2020, PMDC was dissolved again by a joint session of the Senate and Parliament by passing the bill to replace PMDC by PMC to ensure standard medical education in Pakistan.

Early years Urban Pritchard was born on 21 March 1845. He was the fifth son of Andrew Pritchard, a Fellow of the Royal Society. He studied medicine at King's College Hospital, qualifying as Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1868 and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and of the Society of Apothecaries in 1869. He went on to the University of Edinburgh where he was Ettles Scholar. He graduated as Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1869 and Doctor of Medicine in 1871. His thesis, which earned a gold medal, was entitled Researches on the Structure of the Lamina Spiralis Membranacca, with a supplementary chapter on the Staining of Tissues. In 1872 he obtained a diploma as Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Career Pritchard returned to King's College Hospital and was physicians' assistant to Sir George Johnson, Dr. Lionel Beale and Sir Alfred Garrod. He was later appointed surgical registrar and curator of the museum. In September 1872 he was appointed demonstrator of Practical Physiology at King's College London. He was also appointed lecturer on physiology for evening classes at King's College. At the same time, he was researching the structure of the ear, and the organ of Corti in particular. He continued to research and publish papers until 1881, after which he devoted himself to clinical work and to his extensive private practice. In 1874 he was appointed surgeon of the Royal Ear Hospital, holding this position until 1900, when he stepped down and became consulting surgeon. In 1876 he was appointed aural surgeon at King's College Hospital, holding this position until 1910. On his retirement he was succeeded by Arthur Henry Cheatle. In 1886 Pritchard was appointed professor of aural surgery in King's College, the first to hold this position. In 1893 he was made a Fellow of King's College. From 1884 to 1922 he was the main British representative on the organizing committee of the International Congress of Otology, and in 1899 was elected President of this society when it held its meeting in London. He was in 1901‚Äì1903 the second President of the Otological Society of the United Kingdom, which in 1907 became the Otological Section of the Royal Society of Medicine. From 1890 to 1908 he co-edited the International Archives of Otology. Pritchard married Blade Palister in 1872. He died in 1925 at the age of 81. He was survived by his wife, one daughter and two sons. Research Pritchard had to use relatively primitive techniques to prepare histological sections for microscopic examination, but became widely known for the quality of this work. He published four papers on his research into the organ of Corti between 1876 and 1881. The first was read before the Royal Society, where he was introduced by Professor Thomas Henry Huxley, and published in the society's Proceedings of 1876. This paper reported the results of examinations of the cochleas of various mammals including man, monkey, sheep, dog, cat, rabbit, porpoise and kangaroo. In it he supported the views of Hermann von Helmholtz, with some reservations. His last paper described the presence of the lagena in the platypus, which is also found in birds. He saw this organ as a link between the cochlea of higher and lower vertebrates. In the British Medical Journal of January 1880 he reported the preliminary results of an early hearing aid.

This implies that objects are transformed into subjects and subjects are turned into objects, with the result that subjects are rendered passive or determined, while objects are rendered as the active, determining factor. Hypostatization refers to an effect of reification which results from supposing that whatever can be named, or conceived abstractly, must actually exist, an ontological and epistemological fallacy. The concept is related to, but distinct from, Marx's theories of alienation and commodity fetishism.Petroviƒá, Gajo. 2005 [1965]. \\"Reification.\\" Marxists Internet Archive, transcribed by R. Dumain. Originally in T. Bottomore, L. Harris, V. G. Kiernan, and R. Miliband (eds.). 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist Thought. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. Pp. 411‚Äì3. Alienation is the general condition of human estrangement; reification is a specific form of alienation; commodity fetishism is a specific form of reification. Development and significance of the concept Reification was not a particularly prominent term or concept in Marx's own works, nor in that of his immediate successors. The concept of reification rose to prominence chiefly through the work of Georg Luk√°cs (1923), in his essay \\"Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat,\\" as part of his book History and Class Consciousness; this is the locus classicus for defining the term in its current sense. Here, Luk√°cs treats it as a problem of capitalist society related to the prevalence of the commodity form, through a close reading of Marx's chapter on commodity fetishism in Capital. Luk√°cs's account was influential for the philosophers of the Frankfurt School, for example in Horkheimer's and Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment, and in the works of Herbert Marcuse. Others who have written about this point include Max Stirner, Guy Debord, Gajo Petroviƒá, Raya Dunayevskaya, Raymond Williams, Timothy Bewes, Axel Honneth, and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. Petroviƒá (1965) defines reification as: Reification occurs when specifically human creations are misconceived as \\"facts of nature, results of cosmic laws, or manifestations of divine will.\\"Berger, Peter, and Thomas Luckmann. 1966. The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge. New York: Anchor/Doubleday. However, some recent scholarship on Luk√°cs's (1923) own use of the term \\"reification\\" in History and Class Consciousness has challenged this interpretation of the concept, according to which reification implies that a pre-existing subject creates an objective social world which is then alienated from it. Andrew Feenberg (1981) reinterprets Luk√°cs's central category of \\"consciousness\\" as similar to anthropological notions of culture as a set of practices.Feenberg, Andrew. 1986 [1981]. Luk√°cs, Marx and the Sources of Critical Theory. New York: Oxford University Press.Feenberg, Andrew. 2014. The Philosophy of Praxis: Marx, Luk√°cs and the Frankfurt School. London: Verso Press. The reification of consciousness in particular, therefore, is more than just an act of misrecognition; it affects the everyday social practice at a fundamental level beyond the individual subject. Other scholarship has suggested that Luk√°cs's use of the term may have been strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl's phenomenology to understand his preoccupation with the reification of consciousness in particular.Westerman, R. 2010. \\"The Reification of Consciousness: Husserl‚Äôs Phenomenology in Luk√°cs‚Äôs Subject- Object.\\" New German Critique 111. On this reading, reification entails a stance that separates the subject from the objective world, creating a mistaken relation between subject and object that is reduced to disengaged knowing. Applied to the social world, this leaves individual subjects feeling that society is something they can only know as an alien power, rather than interact with. In this respect, Luk√°cs's use of the term could be seen as prefiguring some of the themes Martin Heidegger (1927) touches on in Being and Time, supporting the suggestion of Lucien Goldman (2009) that Luk√°cs and Heidegger were much closer in their philosophical concerns than typically thought.Goldman, Lucien. 2009. Luk√°cs and Heidegger: Towards a New Philosophy, translated by W. Q. Boelhower. London: Routledge. Criticism French philosopher Louis Althusser criticized what he called the \\"ideology of reification\\" that sees \\"'things' everywhere in human relations.\\"Althusser, Louis. 1969 [1965]. For Marx, translated by B. Brewster. p. 230, \\"Marxism and Humanism.\\" Retrieved via From Marx to Mao, transcribed by D. J. Romagnolo (2002). Web. Althusser's critique derives from his theory of the \\"epistemological break,\\" which finds that Marx underwent significant theoretical and methodological change between his early and his mature work. Though the concept of reification is used in Das Kapital by Marx, Althusser finds in it an important influence from the similar concept of alienation developed in the early The German Ideology and in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844. Frankfurt School philosopher Axel Honneth (2008) reformulates this key \\"Western Marxist\\" concept in terms of intersubjective relations of recognition and power.Honneth, Axel. 2008. Reification: A New Look, with responses by Butler, Judith, Raymond Geuss, and Jonathan Lear. New York: Oxford University Press. Instead of being an effect of the structural character of social systems such as capitalism, as Karl Marx and Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs argued, Honneth contends that all forms of reification are due to pathologies of intersubjectively based struggles for recognition.

In the 1980s, it had around 600 branches, 2,000 delegates at its national conferences and published a monthly newspaper, Socialist Youth. From the early 1970s, it was led by members of Militant. Origins The Labour Party has had several youth sections. In the 1930s, the Labour League of Youth had 30,000 members.According to Ted Grant, \\"The Real Situation In Britain\\", 1947, as quoted in Marxists and the British Labour Party: The Experience of Entrism; A Note on Ted Grant's Explanation of Entrism in the 1940s The League took a highly critical stance towards the leadership of the Party and was closed down in 1954. Youth sections continued in some constituencies, however, for instance in Liverpool Walton where there was longstanding entryism from supporters of Ted Grant's Trotskyist faction, which later became the Revolutionary Socialist League. The Walton youth section published Rally, said to stand for \\"Read All About the Labour League of Youth\\". In 1960, a new Labour youth organisation was set up, called the Young Socialists. In 1965, this was renamed the Labour Party Young Socialists. Early political affiliations From the outset, the Young Socialists organisation saw conflict between Trotskyist entryist groups that published the paper Young Guard and a group that published a rival paper, Keep Left, which formed the leadership. Both groups came from the Trotskyist tradition, but their methods and ideas differed considerably. Keep Left was published by the Socialist Labour League, a Trotskyist group led by Gerry Healy, until the League took its supporters out of the Labour Party in 1964-65\\\\. The Socialist Labour League became the Workers Revolutionary Party, which maintained its own Young Socialists section until 1985. It was after the departure of the Keep Left group that the Young Socialists organisation was renamed LPYS. The publication Young Guard was a collaboration between the International Socialists (IS) and the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL), known from 1964 as the Militant group. The RSL, which had produced Rally in Walton, also published Socialist Fight, while before Young Guard the IS had supported a smaller publication, Rebel. By 1963, however, the faltering collaboration had ended, and the Militant was set up in 1964. The Young Guard was continued for a time by the IS alone, but it was discontinued by 1966, and the IS left the Labour Party and LPYS in 1967-68. Militant leadership For a while there was no one group controlling the LPYS National Committee, to which regional bodies elected representatives, usually at regional conferences. Instead, traditional left and right were brought together by the YS Action Committee, chaired by Bill Withnall from Walsall, and organised by its secretary Peter Kent from Crewe. Centred on the West Midlands region, which was described by the Sunday Telegraph as a \\"hotbed of moderation\\", it nonetheless drew support from all regions to counter the entryist tactics of the Militant tendency. Peter Kent represented the North West Region on the LPYS National Committee from 1966 to 1968, and was followed by Roger Stott from Rochdale. However, during the late 1960s the Militant tendency began to win significant numbers of resolutions at the LPYS National Conference. In 1969, resolutions moved by Militant supporters won majorities on all issues except the question of the United Nations, and in 1970 all resolutions moved by Militant supporters were passed, although in order to be passed they had also to be supported by other groups. By 1972, the Militant tendency had gained a majority on the LPYS National Committee.Taaffe, Peter, The Rise of Militant, Chapter 5 The membership of the Labour Party in general moved to the left in the 1970s, and resolutions put to the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) seeking action against Militant were defeated. An LPYS representative was given a place on the NEC, which also employed a Militant tendency Youth Officer, Andy Bevan. Under the leadership of the Militant tendency the LPYS grew rapidly, reaching a high point of 581 branches in 1985, and organising demonstrations and protests against the Thatcher government. Its monthly journal throughout this period was called Socialist Youth, and was edited by John Hird. Reorganisation under Neil Kinnock The Labour Party's student wing, the National Organisation of Labour Students (NOLS), had a majority from the Clause Four group, which had defeated the Militant tendency within NOLS in December 1975. By then many Labour leaders and staff had been members of NOLS, and had experience of clashing with Militant. They now saw no reason why a social democratic party should play host to an \\"entryist\\" organisation with a different ideology. When Neil Kinnock became Labour leader in 1983 the battle stepped up and after 1985 Kinnock made it clear that he was determined to expel the Militant. In 1986, the Labour Party's Annual Conference decided to reorganise the LPYS. In 1987, the Party removed most of the LPYS elected structures, including its National Conference, and reduced its upper age limit from 26 to 23. Reducing the age limit made most of the LPYS's leadership ineligible for membership of the organisation, since most of them were over 23 by the time they had gained enough experience to become leaders of the LPYS. By 1990, the number of LPYS branches had fallen to 52. The LPYS continued until 1993, when the Labour conference supported a motion to set up Young Labour, proposed by Tom Watson (later a Labour MP), seconded by Brian Whitington, then Chair of the LPYS (later Labour candidate in Twickenham in 2005) and supported by Claire Ward, then the Youth Representative on the NEC (and later a Labour MP).

Membership is automatic for Labour Party members aged 14 to 26. It exists to involve young people in the Labour Party and ensure that the aspirations of young people are reflected in Labour‚Äôs policies in power. Young Labour members are able to get involved in the Labour Party through local policy events, campaigning or by attending events and social gatherings. Young Labour hosts an annual conference, alternating between national committee elections and policy conferences every other year. Young Labour also holds a range of additional national events, including fringe sessions at the Labour Party's annual conference. Young Labour is affiliated to both the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) and Young European Socialists (YES). History Young Labour was founded in 1993 by a Labour Party annual conference motion in Brighton, proposed by Tom Watson, seconded by Brian Whitington, then Chair of the Labour Party Young Socialists, and supported by then National Executive Committee Youth Representative Claire Ward. Before 1993 young people in Labour had been represented by the Labour Party Young Socialists. In October 2017, Young Labour passed a motion at their annual conference which called for Britain to withdraw from NATO. In May 2018, the organisation started a digital campaign against then-Labour MP Chuka Umunna after it was revealed that he employed university students to be unpaid interns. The campaign, \\"#PayUpChuka', led to the Labour leadership briefing the Parliamentary Labour Party that employing unpaid interns runs contrary to Labour's 2017 general election manifesto. In October 2018, Young Labour voted to make Brazilian labour leader Lula da Silva its honorary president. Membership Members of the Labour Party aged 14 to 26 are automatically members of Young Labour.  Structure  = Young Labour National Committee = The Young Labour National Committee acts as the executive of the organisation. It includes a chair, the National Executive Committee (NEC) youth rep, an international officer, five liberation officers, two ordinary reps, five trade union reps, three Labour Students reps, and 11 regional reps. In addition, the Labour Party appoints a permanent secretary to act as facilitator, National Policy Forum youth reps appoint a vice chair (policy), and the youth wings of affiliated organisations, such as the Co-operative Party and the Fabian Society, are able to appoint a representative. = Chair of Young Labour = Between 1991 and 2009 the Chair of Young Labour was appointed by the Labour Party. Reforms passed by the Labour Party's annual conference saw the creation of a democratically elected chair, voted for by delegates at Young Labour's national conference, to serve a two-year term. The first election took place in 2009. In late 2017 the Labour Party's NEC changed the system so that the Chair of Young Labour is elected by a one-member-one-vote ballot of young members. It was reported that over 7,000 young members voted in the 2018 election.

After the founding of Former Shu, Zhou served as a chancellor.  During Tang Dynasty  It is not known when Zhou Xiang was born, but he was said to be from Xu Prefecture (Ë®±Â∑û, in modern Xuchang, Henan). The first historical reference to him was in 887, when he was referred to as a former storage officer for Long Prefecture (ÈæçÂ∑û, in modern Mianyang, Sichuan).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Apparently, after leaving that post, he became a guest of the general Wang Jian, who was then the prefect of Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 40. In 887, then-reigning Emperor Xizong of Tang commissioned a new military governor (Jiedushi) of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), which Li Prefecture belonged to ‚Äî Yang Shouliang, the adoptive nephew of the powerful eunuch Yang Fugong. Yang Shouliang was apprehensive about Wang's military abilities, and made several attempts to summon him to Shannan West's capital Xingyuan Municipality (). Wang, in fear of what Yang might do to him, refused to go, and asked Zhou for advice. Zhou stated to him: Wang agreed with Zhou, and he subsequently gathered a group of 8,000 men from the tribes of the area, and then launched a surprise attack on Lang Prefecture via Jialing River. He expelled Yang Maoshi and took over Lang, claiming to be its defender. He then further built up his troops, using Lang as a base. Yang Shouliang could not control him at all from that point on. Wang later became embroiled in a campaign against Chen to try to take over Xichuan Circuit, but was initially unable to prevail. By summer 888, Wang, believing that he could no longer pillage the surroundings of Xichuan's capital Chengdu and that Chengdu's defenses were so strong that he could not prevail quickly, considered withdrawing. Both Zhou and another strategist, Qiwu Jian (), opposed, with Zhou proposing that he instead attack and capture one of Xichuan's prefectures, Qiong Prefecture to use as a base of operations, as the area around Qiong Prefecture was wealthy and capable of sustaining his army. Wang had another idea ‚Äî that he should petition the imperial government to send a senior official to head the operations against Chen and serve as that official's assistant, so he had Zhou draft a petition on his behalf, to then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor), who had long hated Tian. Emperor Zhaozong, in response to Wang's petition and a similar petition from Wang's ally Gu Yanlang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang), commissioned the chancellor Wei Zhaodu to be the military governor of Xichuan, and, when Chen refused to allow Wei to take over, declared a general campaign against Chen, with Wei in command and Wang, Gu, and Yang Shouliang serving as Wei's assistants.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. By 891, the army sieging Chengdu, consisting of troops largely from Wang but also with troops from Gu, had put Chengdu into a chokehold such that the population was starving. However, the imperial government had just suffered a major loss in campaign against another warlord, Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and the costs of the Xichuan campaign gave Emperor Zhaozong second thoughts. In spring 891, Emperor Zhaozong issued an edict pardoning Chen and ordering Gu and Wang to return to their own circuits (Emperor Zhaozong's having earlier carved out four prefectures of Xichuan as a new Yongping Circuit (Ê∞∏Âπ≥, headquartered at Qiong Prefecture, which Wang had captured) and made Wang its military governor). Wang, however, believing that this was a prime chance to capture Xichuan, and when he consulted Zhou, Zhou suggested that he urge Wei to return to the imperial court while he himself would then maintain the campaign. Wang then intimidated Wei by executing one of his close associates, Luo Bao (), on purported offenses of embezzlement. Wei, frightened, transferred his command to Wang and left for the imperial capital Chang'an. Wang subsequently continued the siege, and in fall 891, Chen and Tian surrendered. Wang took over Xichuan Circuit and was subsequently confirmed by Emperor Zhaozong as its military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. There were no further historical references to specific strategic suggestions that Zhou made to Wang, but it was said that much of Wang's subsequent pacification of the region, including his takeover of Dongchuan, could be credited to additional strategies that Zhou offered.  During Wang Jian's reign  In 907, another major warlord, Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), had Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu. Wang Jian, along with Li Keyong, Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and Yang Wo the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), refused to recognize the new Later Liang emperor, and briefly, Wang and Yang were jointly issuing declarations calling for the entire realm to rise against Later Liang. However, when they did not get sufficient responses, Wang decided to declare himself the emperor of a new state of Shu (known later as Former Shu) (as its Emperor Gaozu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. In 910, he made Zhou Xiang Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)) and chancellor, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). However, nothing else was recorded in history about Zhou's acts during Wang Jian's reign.  During Wang Yan's reign  After Wang Jian died in 918 and was succeeded by his son Wang Zongyan as emperor, he trusted a number of eunuchs, making them generals and allowing them to intervene in governance. It was said that they were arrogant, unrestrained, corrupt, and violent, causing much damage to the state. When Zhou Xiang tried to urge Wang Yan to change his ways, Wang Yan would not listen.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. In 920, he made Zhou the military governor of Yongping Circuit (then-headquartered in modern Ya'an, Sichuan), sending him out of the capital but still having him maintain the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi designation as an honorary chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271.The Zizhi Tongjian gave Zhou's title as military governor of Yongping, while the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms gave his title as military governor of Wuping Circuit (Ê≠¶Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Changde, Hunan), which was then the territory of Chu. While honorary military governor titles based on circuits not actually held were common in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, it would seem that a commission as the military governor of Yongping was more plausible than one as the military governor of Wuping. Zhou died shortly after due to illness.  Notes and references  * Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (), vol. 40. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 256, 257, 258, 270, 271.

This constitution, which was ratified soon after the Declaration Of Rights Of The Working And Exploited People, formally recognized the working class as the ruling class of Russia according to the principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat, therein making the Russian Soviet Republic the world's first constitutionally socialist state. History The ultimate aims of the state were outlined as: \\"the abolition of the exploitation of men by men, the entire abolition of the division of the people into classes, the suppression of exploiters, [and] the establishment of a socialist society.\\" The constitution stated that a historic alliance had been formed between the workers and peasants, who together would govern the state through the soviets. The constitution explicitly denied political power to higher classes of Russian society or to those who supported the White armies in the Civil War (1918‚Äì21). To prevent the higher classes from re- claiming state power, the first article called for all workers and peasants to be armed and organized into a Red Army while the higher classes be fully disarmed. Supreme power rested with the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, made up of deputies from local soviets across Russia. The steering committee of the Congress of Soviets‚Äîknown as the Central Executive Committee‚Äîacted as the \\"supreme organ of power\\" between sessions of the congress and as the collective presidency of the state. The congress elected the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom, Sovet narodnykh kommissarov) as the administrative arm of the young government and defined its responsibilities as \\"general administration of the affairs of the state\\". (The Sovnarkom had exercised governmental authority from November 1917 until the adoption of the 1918 constitution July 10 by the Congress of Soviets.) One of the first Soviet iterations of a perennial biblical phrase appeared in Article 18, which declares labour to be the duty of all citizens of the Republic, and sloganeers: 'He who does not work, neither shall he eat!' Importantly, the 1918 Russian Constitution's main principles served as a precursor to the ensuing constitutions of both united and autonomous Soviet republics. They were recognized as fundamental to the 1924 Soviet Constitution, which was the formative document of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The October Revolution ousted the provisional government, making the Congress of Soviets the sole, and supreme governing body. It is important to note that this Congress was not the same as the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union which governed the whole Soviet Union after its creation in 1922. For the earlier portion of its life, the Congress was a democratic body. Over Russia there were hundreds of soviets, democratic local governing bodies in which the surrounding population could participate. The soviets elected the delegates to the Congress, and then in turn the Congress held the national authority, making the highest decisions. There were several political parties represented in the various sessions of the Congress, each of which fought for increasing their own influence in the soviets. However, as the civil war progressed, the soviets' authority was progressively reduced, with the rise to power of Stalinism effectively cementing this situationModels of Democracy, David Held, p. 225. \\"Stalinism destroyed the possibility of a radical workers' democracy, installed briefly in the Soviet Union in October 1917 under Lenin's leadership\\" and decisively turning the Congress into a rubber-stamp parliament. The Congress was formed of representatives of city councils (1 delegate per 25,000 voters) and the congresses of the provincial (oblast) and autonomous republican councils (1 deputy for every 125,000 inhabitants). The exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress consisted of the election of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, adoption of the Constitution of the Russian SFSR and amendments to it, approval of amendments proposed by the central executive committee, and approval of the autonomous republics' constitutions. On the other issues, the Congress and the Central Executive Committee had the same authority. The Congress ceased to exist at the end of the constitutional reform of 1936‚Äì1937, when first on the union and then at the republican levels indirect election to Soviets were replaced by direct elections at all levels with the Supreme Soviet as the highest body.  History  =Origin of Soviets= The first soviets appeared during the 1905 Russian Revolution as councils (soviets) of workers in those cities that were captured by mass strikes (strike action).Kulchytskyi, S. Soviets of workers', peasants', and soldiers' deputies of toilers, people's deputies (–†–ê–î–ò –†–û–ë–Ü–¢–ù–ò–ß–ò–•, –°–ï–õ–Ø–ù–°–¨–ö–ò–• –Ü –°–û–õ–î–ê–¢–°–¨–ö–ò–• –î–ï–ü–£–¢–ê–¢–Ü–í, –î–ï–ü–£–¢–ê–¢–Ü–í –¢–†–£–î–Ø–©–ò–•, –ù–ê–†–û–î–ù–ò–• –î–ï–ü–£–¢–ê–¢–Ü–í). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine Enterprises that were participating in those strikes had delegated to those councils their delegates to coordinate joint actions. In various locations those councils carried different names such as \\"Soviet of workers deputies\\", \\"Delegate assembly\\", \\"Assembly of deputies\\", \\"Commission of elected\\", and others. By October 1905 the \\"Soviet of workers deputies\\" became more common. Following the example of Soviets of workers deputies in other locations were appearing Soviets of workers, sailors, and soldiers deputies, Soviets of workers and peasants deputies, Soviet of peasants deputies. Originally, those soviets were mass political organizations. For socialist parties the appearance of soviets was unexpected, yet each made an effort to delegate to them their representatives. Mensheviks and SRs view those soviets as strike committees or local authorities of self-government. Bolsheviks have seen in them the authority with help of which they could install in the country their dictatorship. In 1905 Vladimir Lenin noted that in political relations the Soviet of workers deputies should be viewed as the kernel (germ) of provisional revolutionary government. In 1917 Vladimir Lenin in his April theses came up with the famous slogan \\"All power to the Soviets!\\". Following the February Revolution, Lenin considered that in Russia dual power existed as an interweaving of bourgeoisie power (Provisional Government) and the powers of the revolutionary masses (soviets). All other Russian political parties considered soviets as temporary public organizations and dual power did not exist for them as they were preparing for elections to the All-Russian Constituent Assembly. Embedment of Bolsheviks into the Soviets (Bolshevization of the Soviets) established the Communist-Soviet system of state power in the USSR which existed until the 1988 constitutional reform.Kulchystskyi, S.

In communist-soviet system of power, the dictatorship of party (professional revolutionaries) was concealed by popular sovereignty (people's rule) of the soviets and therefore officially the political regime has been called the Soviet power. =Main meetings= Conference Following the February Revolution, on 11‚Äì16 April 1917 in Petrograd the All- Russian conference of Soviets of workers and soldiers deputies was held.All- Russian conference of Soviets of workers and soldiers deputies (–í—Å–µ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–µ —Å–æ–≤–µ—â–∞–Ω–∏–µ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤ —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏—Ö –∏ —Å–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–µ–ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–≤). Great Soviet Encyclopedia. At the conference, 480 delegates out of 139 Soviets, 13 military rear area garrisons, 7 of regular army, and 26 separate frontline councils attended. On the agenda were * attitude towards the War * attitude towards the Russian Provisional Government * organizational issues * organization of revolutionary forces * preparation to the Russian Constituent Assembly * food issue * land issue * issues of peasants' life * workers' issues * others Majority was composed of Mensheviks and SRs. The Bolshevik group introduced its own resolution drafts on key issues of agenda. In its resolution on war that was rather defensive, presented by Menshevik-SR Petrograd Soviet Executive Committee, the conference approved the declaration of the Provisional Government about the war (of 28 March) as if it abandoned aggressive goals. The Bolshevik group, on behalf of which Lev Kamenev had been speaking, took a wrong position by taking off own resolution draft and voting for the Menshevik-SR resolution after it was added with resolutions about \\"control and impact\\" of revolutionary democracy on the Provisional Government and its local authorities. Recognizing the need for a legislative establishment of 8 hour workday, the conference did not call the workers upon its immediate establishment by revolutionary means. On peasant and land issues, the conference adopted its resolution about support in the Constituent Assembly for gratuitous alienation from all privately owned lands and transferring them to working people, but spoke against \\"arbitrary resolution of land issue at local level\\", leaving, thus, the land in hands of landowners. On 16 April 1917 the conference elected 10 delegates from oblasts and 6 from the Army and the Navy to the Petrograd Soviet Executive Committee turning it in this way in central authority of Soviets of the whole country until the opening of First All-Russian Congress of Soviets of workers and soldiers deputies. On 17 April 1917, Vladimir Lenin made a report about war and revolution in which he outlined his April theses to that conference. The same day he repeated his report at a joint conference of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks who took part. First Congress The First All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies (June 16 ‚Äì July 7, 1917) was convened by the National Conference of the Soviets.Leonard Schapiro, The Origin of the Communist Autocracy: Political Opposition in the Soviet State First Phase 1917‚Äì1922, Second Edition, New York: MacMillan Press, 1977, p. 41, 363. It was dominated by pro-government parties (Socialist-Revolutionaries, etc.) and confirmed the supremacy of the Russian Provisional Government. There were 1090 delegates, 822 with a right to vote, representing 305 workers', soldiers' and peasant soviets, and 53 regional, provincial and district soviets. The breakdown of delegates by party was thus: 285 Socialist-Revolutionaries, 248 Mensheviks, 105 Bolsheviks, 32 Menshevik Internationalists, and others.First All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, Saint Petersburg Encyclopaedia.

The right to vote was given to these soviets containing at least 25,000 persons, and a voice was given to these containing from 10,000 to 25,000. Second Congress Following the overthrow of the Provisional Government of Russia in the October Revolution, the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies (November 7‚Äì9, 1917) ratified the revolutionary transfer of state power.Leonard Schapiro, The Origin of the Communist Autocracy: Political Opposition in the Soviet State First Phase 1917‚Äì1922, Second Edition, New York: MacMillan Press, 1977, p. 54, 58, 64, 363. 649 delegates were elected to the Congress, representing 318 local soviets; 390 were Bolsheviks, about 100 left SRs, about 60 other SRs, 72 Mensheviks, 14 United Socialist Democrat- Internationalists, 6 Menshevik Internationalists and 7 of other factions.All- Russian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet Deputies, Second. A. M. Kulegin. Encyclopaedia of St. Petersburg.All-Russian Congress of the Soviet, Marxist Internet Archive. On the first day of the Congress, the Socialist Revolutionaries split into two groups ‚Äì the Left Social Revolutionaries and the Right Social Revolutionaries. Also on the first day, the Menshevik delegation and Right Socialist Revolutionary deputies walked out in protest. 505 delegates voted in favour of the transfer of power to the Soviets. The All-Russian Central Executive Committee and Council of People's Commissars was elected by the Congress, naming Lenin the Chairman, and thus making him the head of government. At the opening of the Congress, Vladimir Lenin gave a speech saying that the \\"Soviet government will propose an immediate democratic peace to all the nations and an immediate armistice on all fronts\\" and declared \\"Long live the revolution!,\\" uttering what are sometimes called the \\"Land Decree\\" and \\"Decree on Peace.\\"Vladimir Lenin, \\"To Workers, Soldiers, and Peasants!\\"Vladimir Lenin, \\"Report on peace; delivered at the Second All- Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, October 26 (November 8) 1917,\\" Internet Archive.Jonathan D.

Third Congress The Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies (January 23‚Äì31, 1918) was attended by delegates from 317 Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' with a further 110 delegates from army, corps and divisional committees.Leonard Schapiro, The Origin of the Communist Autocracy: Political Opposition in the Soviet State First Phase 1917‚Äì1922, Second Edition, New York: MacMillan Press, 1977, p. 363. The Bolsheviks comprised 441 of the 707 delegates.The 3rd All-Russian Congress of Soviets completed its work, Yeltsin Presidential Library, January 31, 1918. On the fourth day January 13 (26), more delegates who had been at the Third All- Russia Congress of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies arrived. By the end there were 1,587 delegates. The Congress had a Presidium composed of ten Bolsheviks and three Left Socialist-Revolutionaries with a further delegate from each other group (Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, etc.). The Swiss, Romanian, Swedish and Norwegian Social-Democratic parties, the British Socialist Party and the Socialist Party of America sent messages of solidarity. Occurring shortly after the Constituent Assembly had been dissolved by order of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK), the Congress resolved to expunge any references to the forthcoming Constituent Assembly from all new editions of decrees and laws of the Soviet Government. The Congress received: * Yakov Sverdlov's report on the activity of the All- Russian Central Executive Committee. * Vladimir Lenin's report on the activity of the Council of People's Commissars. * Joseph Stalin's report from the People's Commissariat of Nationalities on the principles of federation and the nationalities' policy for the emerging Soviet state. The nationalities policy was agreed. The Mensheviks, Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Menshevik internationalists used the Congress to indicate their opposition to the domestic and foreign policy which the Bolsheviks passed. The Declaration of Rights of the Working and Exploited People was passed and this went on to become the basis of the Soviet Constitution. It was also agreed to establish the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on the basis of a free union of the peoples of Russia.Jonathan D. Smele, Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916‚Äì1926, Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2015, p. 317-318.

This marked a rift between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, who voted against the treaty and whose ministers quit the Sovnarkom in protest.Mawdsley, Evan. The Russian Civil War p. 40. Fifth Congress The Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers‚Äô Peasants‚Äô, Soldiers‚Äô and Red Army Deputies was held July 4‚Äì10, 1918. A decree that \\"linked citizenship to military service and obliged all healthy men aged 18‚Äì40 years to come forward\\" and fight for the Red Army in the Russian Civil War was passed.Jonathan D. Smele, Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916‚Äì1926, Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2015, p. xxx, 39, 315, 670‚Äì671, 751. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had 352 delegates compared to 745 Bolsheviks out of 1132 total. The Left SRs raised disagreements on the suppression of rival parties, the death penalty, and mainly, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Left SR Uprising broke out on during this Congress. Its suppression marked the end of Left SR participation in the Congress of Soviet.

It is widely used to measure minimum, maximum (or first bubble point) and mean flow pore sizes, and pore size distribution of the through pores in membranes nonwovens, paper, filtration and ultrafiltration media, hollow fibers, ceramics, etc. In capillary flow porometry an inert gas is used to displace a liquid, which is in the pores. The pressure required to empty the pore corresponds to the pressure necessary to evacuate the liquid from the most constricted part of the pore. This most constricted part is the most challenging one and it offers the highest resistance to remove the wetting liquid. This parameter is very relevant in filtration and similar applications since it is important to know the smallest diameter of the through pores. Calculation of the pore size In order to measure the pore size by capillary flow porometry it is necessary to impregnate the samples with a wetting liquid. An inert gas flow is used to displace the liquid that is in the pores and the pressure required to empty the most constricted part of the pore is measured. The most constricted part of the pore is the most challenging one because it offers the highest resistance to remove the wetting liquid. This parameter is very important in filtration and similar applications since it is essential to know the smallest diameter of the through pores. This measured pressure permits obtaining the pore diameter, which is calculated by using the Young-Laplace formula P= 4*Œ≥*cos Œ∏*/D in which D is the pore size diameter, P is the pressure measured, Œ≥ is the surface tension of the wetting liquid and Œ∏ is the contact angle of the wetting liquid with the sample. The surface tension Œ≥ is a measurable physical property and depends on the wetting liquid used. The contact angle Œ∏ depends on the interaction between the material and the wetting liquid. In capillary flow porometry, in opposition to mercury intrusion porosimetry, the wetting liquid enters spontaneously the pores of the sample ensuring a total wetting of the material, and therefore the contact angle of the wetting liquid with the sample is 0 and the previous formula can be simplied as: P= 4*Œ≥/D. Measurement methods =Pressure scan= Figure 1. Continuous increase of pressure in time. This is the traditional approach, in which the pressure increases continuously at a constant rate (figure 1), which can be modified depending the instrument and the user's requirements, and the gas flow through the sample is measured. Again, the number of data points acquired can be adjusted by the user. It is a fast and reproducible method that is generally recommended for quality control work and for samples with all pores identical. However it is important to take into account that when the samples present a complex structure and with a considerable amount of pores of different tortuosity it is possible that during the pressure scan pores with the same diameter but longer pore path are not emptied at the pressure corresponding to their diameter (if the scan is fast there is not time to allow the gas flow to displace the wetting liquid through the pore length). As consequence, the pores with longer pore length will be report smaller pore sizes than the actual ones. =Pressure step/stability= Figure 2. Increase of the pressure with respect of time in steps, holding the actual pressure for a certain time before increasing it to the next value. The pressure/step stability method represents an alternative for the pressure scan method which permits a more accurate measurement of the pore sizes. It takes into account the different tortuosity and pore length of pores with the same diameter. The acquisition of a data point is only carried out after holding the pressure at a constant value for a user-defined time (see figure 2) and also only after the gas flow through the sample is stable, which is also defined by the user. This allows enough time for the gas flow to displace the wetting liquid in long and tortuous pores of the same diameter. Therefore the pressure step/stability method is the most recommended one for research and development applications. Additionally, the pressure step/stability measuring principle allows measuring the true First Bubble Point (FBP), in opposition to the pressure scan method, which only permits calculation the FBP at the selected flow rates. Measured First Bubble Point (FBP) The FBP is defined by the ASTM F-316-03 standard as the pressure at which the first continuous gas bubbles are detected. In practice FBP is associated as the largest or maximum pore size. The calculation of the FBP requires to select a certain minimum flow (e.g. 30, 50, 100 ml/min) and when it is achieved record the pressure. Then this pressure is used to calculate the FBP size. The question is to select the minimum flow through the sample and the major disadvantage is that this minimum flow is different for every sample and it is not easy to determine a priori. If a certain minimum flow is selected for the calculation it is possible that the largest pore in the sample was already open for a while before that particular flow was determined. With the step/stability method it is possible to measure the true FBP. When applying a constant gas flow, before the opening of the largest flow the pressure increases in a linear way. At the moment that the gas flow passes through the sample via the largest pore the pressure increase drops and it is this particular pressure the one that corresponds to the FBP of the sample. Parameters measured Figure 1. Parameters measured in porometry. Capillary flow porometry permits obtaining several parameters and information in one individual and fast measurement. In general, a measurements with the wet sample (impregnated with wetting liquid) is carried out first. It is normally known as the \\"wet run\\" and the representation of the gas flow vs. the applied pressure is the so-called \\"wet curve\\". After the wet run the measurement of the same sample in dry state is carried out in order to register and analogous \\"dry curve\\". The half-dry curve is calculated and represented by dividing the flow values with respect to the applied pressure by 2 and it is also represented in the same graphic. From the representation of the three curves it is possible to identify relevant information about the sample: the maximum pore size (or first bubble point) is recorded when gas flow through the sample is detected (please see explanation about FBP above), the mean flow pore size corresponds to the pore size calculated at the pressure where the wet curve and the half dry curve meet (it corresponds at the pore size at which 50% of the total gas flow can be accounted), and the minimum pore size results from the pressure at which the wet and the dry curve meet (from this point onwards the flow will be the same because all the pores have been emptied). Apart from these individual pore sizes, the same CFP measurement permits the representation of the cumulative filter flow distribution vs the pore size, which provides information about the percentage of the cumulative total flow through the sample that goes through pores of a larger size than a certain value. Another information that can be obtained from the measurements is the corrected differential filter flow, which shows the flow distribution per unit of change in size, i.e. the increase in flow rate per unit increase in pore diameter. It is also defined as pore size distribution. Wetting liquids The selection of the wetting liquid is important as it determines the measureable pore size range for a given pressure. Some common wetting liquids used in capillary flow porometry include water, alcohols, silicone oil and perfluoroethers. The use of water and/or alcohols present the disadvantage that they can evaporate and therefore the samples can partially dry before the actual porometry test begins. Also water, for instance, has a relatively high surface tension (Œ≥= 72 dynes/cm) compared to perfluoroethers (e.g. Œ≥= 16 dynes/cm), which means that in order to measure the same pore size using water as a wetting liquid it is required to apply 4 times more pressure than when using a perfluoroethers. Silicone oil does not present the evaporation drawback but its high viscosity makes the cleaning of the equipment parts in between different measurements not easy. Perfluoroethers have very low surface tensions and low vapour pressures, which makes them immune to the problem of evaporation. In general they do not react with samples neither cause their swelling. In principle there is no universal wetting liquid and the choice of one or another depends on the application and the type of sample to be characterized. Nevertheless it is important to use always the same wetting liquid when comparing results.

He is Dean for Precision Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Chief Executive Officer of Sema4, a spinout next generation health information company of the Mount Sinai Health System that provides advanced genomic testing and merges big data analytics with clinical diagnostics. He was previously founding director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology and chair of the Department of Genetics and Genomics Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Schadt‚Äôs work combines supercomputing and advanced computational modeling with diverse biological data to understand the relationship between genes, gene products, other molecular features such as cells, organs, organisms, and communities and their impact on complex human traits such as disease. He is known for calling for a shift in molecular biology toward a network-oriented view of living systems to complement the reductionist, single-gene approaches that currently dominate biology to more accurately model the complexity of biological systems. Schadt has also worked to engage the public, encouraging people to participate in scientific research and helping them understand privacy concerns around DNA-based information. Research and training In 1983, Schadt left high school early to enlist in the United States Air Force and joined a Special Operations/Rescue unit. After sustaining a serious shoulder injury that required reconstructive surgery, Schadt attended California Polytechnic State University on a military scholarship to study computer science and mathematics, and received his bachelor's degree in applied mathematics in 1991. He went on to earn a master's degree in pure mathematics at the University of California, Davis in 1993. After that, he pursued a PhD in biomathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles, which required PhD candidacy in both molecular biology and biomathematics, completing his doctorate under the supervision of Ken Lange in 2000. During his PhD work, Schadt worked as a senior software engineer at the UCLA Office of Academic Computing and later as director of computing in the UCLA mathematical sciences department. Scientific career While completing his PhD, Schadt joined Roche Bioscience in 1998 as a senior research scientist and began his work on DNA microarrays, designing novel algorithms to process and interpret these data. He published some of the first independently developed algorithms to process gene chip data work that he later applied to produce an early whole genome functional annotation of the human genome. In 1999, after becoming acquainted with Stephen Friend, he was hired as chief scientist at Rosetta Inpharmatics, a startup biotech company focused on the generation and analysis of high-dimensional functional genomics data. Merck acquired Rosetta in 2001, which allowed Schadt to combine large-scale molecular profiling with Merck‚Äôs disease-focused databases to demonstrate the existence of molecular networks working together to give rise to complex system behavior. During this period Schadt developed his theory that single-gene approaches to understanding and treating common human diseases must give way to a network- based approach and that many of the failures in pharmaceutical therapies were caused by an incomplete understanding of biology underlying the therapeutic targets. Demonstrating the ability to infer causal relationships among features in high dimensional data using DNA variation information, Schadt and his colleagues at Merck began reconstructing predictive networks that were shown to be causally associated with disease, leading to the idea of targeting networks, not single genes, to effectively treat common disorders such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, obesity, and most forms of cancer. A Merck spokesman said that the papers Schadt began publishing based on this genetic network data ‚Äúchanged the way people looked at disease.‚Äù Schadt used the information about these networks to determine which genes Merck should pursue as targets; by the time he left the company, Schadt estimated that his group was responsible for half the drugs in the company‚Äôs development pipeline. In 2009, along with Stephen Friend, Schadt founded Sage Bionetworks, a nonprofit organization with the goal of encouraging collaboration between academic and commercial scientists in performing network-based studies of disease and making the data publicly available. When Merck closed down the Rosetta business unit, it donated the data, research, and computer equipment from that unit to Sage Bionetworks. Schadt remains involved as a board member. Also in 2009, Schadt joined DNA sequencing company Pacific Biosciences as the chief scientific officer. During his time there, Schadt demonstrated the application of SMRT sequencing technology for various applications, including to sequence bacterial genomes of public health concern to provide real-time information about these pathogenic strains during an active outbreak. He led research projects to resolve the origins of the Haitian cholera outbreak strain from 2010 and to characterize the highly virulent German E. coli outbreak strain in the summer of 2011. He also demonstrated the ability to infer epigenetic changes from the sequencing data, uncovering novel regulatory mechanisms that may impact pathogenicity and virulence of bacteria of concern in public health. In 2011, Schadt joined the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, where he founded the new Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology and became chair of the Department of Genetics and Genomics Sciences. The new institute was launched with $100 million for the first five years and is co- directed by Andrew Kasarskis. Schadt has said that his interest in joining Mt. Sinai was to bring predictive modeling of biology to patients. In his time at the institute, he has opened the first CLIA-certified next-generation sequencing lab in New York City and established the first class at the school in which students sequence their own genomes. Schadt also serves on the executive committee of the New York Genome Center. In 2013, Schadt and his team were awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health to study biological networks in Alzheimer's disease. They also published a paper in Cell reporting that a network of genes linked to inflammatory response plays a role in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Also that year, Schadt joined the Cure Alzheimer's Fund's Research Consortium along with Richard L. Huganir. Schadt started a personalized cancer therapy initiative at the Icahn Institute to analyze tumor DNA, RNA, and protein states for a more tailored treatment approach for patients with cancer. One example is a colon cancer patient named Stephanie Lee.

According to the article, \\"The New York City hospital is bringing on top Silicon Valley talent to build a facility that will map patients‚Äô genomes to predict diseases, reduce the number of average hospital visits, and streamline electronic medical records.\\" In May 2014, Schadt and his team announced the Resilience Project in collaboration with Sage Bionetworks. The project is intended to perform genotyping on as many as 1 million people to find protective biological mechanisms that prevent disease-causing genetic mutations from becoming active. Participants will be healthy people age 30 and older, and the project will initially target variations linked to 127 Mendelian diseases. Based on an analysis of publicly available data, scientists in the Resilience Project estimate that one person in 15,000 has a protective mechanism preventing activity of disease-causing genetic variants. Media appearances and awards Schadt has appeared on CBS Morning News, CNN, CBS This Morning, and the Katie Couric talk show. He and his scientific projects have been profiled in the New York Times, Esquire magazine, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, among others, and several scientific trade publications. He was executive producer and creative director of a documentary film called ‚ÄúThe New Biology‚Äù that won a Cine Master Series Award in 2012. He published a commentary in Huffington Post calling on scientists to incorporate information about RNA, proteins, metabolites and more into their genetic or clinical research, while asking the public to participate in research projects to help speed scientific discovery. In 2014, he was named on the list of \\"The World's Most Influential Scientific Minds\\" by Thomson Reuters and was given the Rustum Roy Spirit Award by The Chopra Foundation. Selected publications Schadt has published more than 190 peer- reviewed papers. A few of these publications include: A Nature Genetics paper that was selected by Science as one of the top 10 breakthroughs of the year in 2005. The first publication linking a full-genome scan of methylation to a genome sequence for the E. coli microbe. One of the earliest publications using microarrays to annotate the human genome. An editorial in Molecular Systems Biology on privacy concerns in the genome era calling for improved education of legislators, expanded non-discrimination laws, and protection of patients' rights. A publication in Nature Genetics predicting a shift from genome-wide association studies to integrative, network-based association studies (INAS) that take into account more types of biological data in order to discern the cause of variation in traits and diseases.

It was home to many miners‚Äô families from the late 19th century through the mid 20th century when the mines were finally closed and the houses condemned and demolished. Today there is nothing to show that, for almost three quarters of a century, a close-knit community of dozens of working families lived and worked there but still, hidden beneath a peaceful agricultural scene, lie the tunnels and workings in which they laboured to bring up the coal to feed British industry. History =The Pit= Coal mining has been associated with this area of north east England for many hundreds of years. It is believed that monks from nearby Hulne Priory were mining coal in the area from around the 12th century and written survey records, held by the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries, exist from the 1500s of transactions involving the transfer of ownership of coal mines and mining rights. There are three main seams of coal in the Shilbottle area of Northumberland, the Townsend, Cannel and Shilbottle and these have been mined in various ways for many hundreds of years at various locations, resulting in multiple spoil heaps becoming part of the countryside over time. Nineteenth century Shilbottle is described in Parish data of the period as comprising five poor law townships of Shilbottle, Shilbottle Woodhouse, Hazon, Hartlaw and Newton-on-the-Moor. The mine most associated with Bilton Banks community was Longdyke Pit. It was sunk in about 1844/5 at a depth of around 25 fathoms (a fathom equals 1.828 metres or approximately 6 feet). The shaft was ten and a half feet in diameter. Coal was transported underground on a system of carts and rails. The carts were towed by pit ponies who lived for many years in the mines, never coming up into the sunlight until they were retired, by which time their eyesight had often been badly affected. The mine operated three shifts of miners. Day to day injuries were common, after all, mining was a dangerous occupation but according to The Coalmining History Resource Centre, in the 50-year period from 1800 there were on average three major colliery disasters nationally every year. During this period 3,486 men and boys were recorded as killed or injured underground. Things were even worse in the next 50 years with 59,580 serious injuries and deaths. The most common cause of death appears to be \\"Fall of Stone\\". =The Village= In the census of June 1841, the village of Bilton Banks shows only two families of agricultural workers as resident. Following an adverse report of housing conditions in the village of Shilbottle by a sanitary inspector in 1874, housing at Bilton Banks was constructed adjacent to Longdyke Colliery, to house the mine workers. By the census of 1881, 29 dwellings are listed with a total of 144 occupants and by 1891 164 people are shown as living in the village, of which by far the majority worked in some fashion at the colliery. Living conditions were Spartan however with only one room below, two above and for most, no inside sink, bath or toilet facilities. Later additions included a lean-to wash house with a sink and pantry on the rear of the house. The enclosed ‚Äòprivies‚Äô, consisting of a wooden seat with a hole in it under which was positioned a large galvanised bucket, were a short walk across the lane and beyond them were the middens which were cleared weekly by the ‚Äònight soil men‚Äô with wheelbarrows, horse and cart. With the poor state of the nation‚Äôs health, highlighted by the poor quality of recruits offered to the military, national health became a government concern between the wars and beginning with the 1919 ‚ÄòAddison Act‚Äô (named after its author, Dr Christopher Addison) various housing acts transferred responsibility for working class housing, sanitation and living conditions to local authorities. Longdyke Colliery was abandoned in August 1925 but the village remained. In 1937 the houses at Bilton Banks, owned at that time by the Duke of Northumberland, were inspected under the provisions of the Housing Act 1925. The Inspector, after a detailed survey of the properties, concluded that the houses should be condemned and the occupants re-housed. However, many survived into the 1950s before finally being demolished. =Industrial Relations= With working conditions as hard as they undoubtedly were, strikes occurred with regularity in the oft repeated endeavour to improve miners‚Äô conditions. These met with varying degrees of success. In 1831 at Shilbottle, the miners prevailed but in 1832 the coal owners crushed the union, ensuring that little immediate improvement occurred. A national movement gradually developed which led to strike action being recommended in 1912. Agreement was reached locally on a minimum wage but the Northumberland Miners‚Äô Federation refused permission for the men to work without the assent of the National Federation. National economic conditions resulted in local shopkeepers refusing credit which severely impacted families in mining communities. The manager of the Shilbottle company gave local families permission to scavenge the heaps close to the colliery for coal. Fortunately the strike ended with the passage, on 28 March 1912, of the Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Act 1912 .

Built in 1934 by Anna Dodge, widow of automobile pioneer Horace E. Dodge, it was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1971 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Despite this, the house was demolished in 1976. History John and Horace Dodge were machinists and early suppliers to, and investors in, the Ford Motor Company. The Dodge Brothers became immensely wealthy, and in 1912, Horace Dodge and his wife Anna Thompson Dodge hired Albert Kahn to design a palatial red sandstone house on Jefferson Avenue in Detroit. The landscaping featured a series of terraces cascading down to Lake St. Clair; Anna Dodge filled these with roses and the mansion was subsequently dubbed \\"Rose Terrace.\\" In 1920, Horace Dodge died, leaving his fortune entirely to his widow, Anna. She continued to live at Rose Terrace, but was reportedly unhappy and lonely. In 1926, she married actor Hugh Dillman, and the couple decided to build a completely new mansion. They purchased the nearby Country Club of Detroit and razed both the clubhouse and the original Rose Terrace in 1930. Anna and Hugh spent two years in Europe, advised by noted art dealer Joseph Duveen, collecting art, material, and inspiration for their new mansion. They hired architect Horace Trumbauer of Philadelphia to design the new mansion and the George A. Fuller Company of New York City to supervise construction, which began in 1931. The mansion was finally completed in 1934 at a cost of $4 million. (approximately $75 million in 2017 dollars) However, even before the new Rose Terrace was completed, Hugh and Anna's marriage soured. They divorced in 1947 and Anna took back \\"Dodge\\" as her last name. After Anna's last child, Horace Jr., died in 1962, she stayed living in seclusion at Rose Terrace until her own death in 1970. After her death, the furnishings of the Music Room were willed to the Detroit Institute of Arts. The remaining contents were sold by Christie's in 1971. A catalogue of Anna Dodge's bequest was published in 1996, and includes a section on other works of art given by Anna Thomson Dodge or acquired from her estate from 1925‚Äì1973, as well as works of art purchased with the Mr and Mrs Horace E. Dodge Memorial Fund 1971‚Äì1995; however, in the year 2000, the Detroit Institute of Arts de-accessioned a number of works of art in the first category, items made specifically for the Music Room at Rose Terrace (many by Alavoine et Cie) on commission from Joseph Duveen, which were sold at Christie's in New York on May 24, namely the Aubusson carpet, the four bronze and crystal chandeliers by Bagu√®s Fr√©res, the four display cabinets that had held Anna Dodge's collection of S√®vres, and the copy of a pair of Jardini√®res ensuite with a pair of late eighteenth century Ath√©niennes still in the bequest (Lots 316-321). For the next few years, the house was used by local organizations for fundraisers or meetings. However, upkeep of the mansion was prohibitively expensive, and there were no buyers who wanted to maintain the house. It was eventually sold to a developer, and despite efforts to save the mansion for its historical significance, it was demolished in the summer of 1976. Description Interior c 1971 Trumbauer's design for Rose Terrace emerged as an enlarged version of Miramar, his 1911 design for George Dunton Widener. The house was a French-style Louis XV chateau overlooking Lake St. Clair, and was approached from Jefferson via a long circular drive. It was constructed from brick walls on a concrete foundation, and surfaced with Indiana limestone. The mansard roof was sheathed with copper. The main floor contained numerous reception rooms, a formal dining room, a library, a breakfast room, two sitting rooms, a music room/ballroom, a card room, a bar, and a kitchen pantry. All rooms had ceilings. The music room, a favorite of Anna Dodge's, measured by , and contained an organ purchased by Horace Dodge for the original Rose Terrace. A marble staircase and an elevator connected the first and second floors. Half of the second floor was used as Mrs. Dodge's private suite. She and her husband Hugh shared a sitting room and office, but each had separate bedrooms, dressing rooms and bathrooms. The other half held another second office and sitting room, and well as eight guest rooms with baths. The attic held the servant's quarters, including an apartment for the housekeeper, a valet's room, twelve maids' rooms, and six rooms for male servants. The basement of the house held the kitchen, the servants' dining room, an ice cream parlor, a flower room, a wine cellar, a gymnasium and storage vaults for furs, rugs, and silver. When completed and furnished, the mansion contained over , had 75 rooms, (including 42 main rooms), 15 fireplaces, 40 French doors, 37 sofas, and more than 100 tables. Many of the furnishings had a notable provenance, including a bureau made for Catherine the Great, four chairs that had belonged to Marie Antoinette, a piano once used by the children of George III, a jewel casket that had belonged to Russian Empress Maria Feodorovna, and a rosewood writing table made by Jean Henri Riesener.

It was first published in 1772. The title of the hymn was based on a verse in the Book of Exodus: \\"I am the God of thy Father, the God of Abraham\\". ()  History  Olivers worked with John Wesley during the time that \\"The God of Abraham Praise\\" was written. During the time, he often met with members of London's Jewish community. In 1772, Olivers was attending The Great Synagogue in London and heard Cantor Myer Lyon sing \\"Yigdal\\" in Hebrew during a service. Olivers then paraphrased and translated \\"Yigdal\\" into English and gave the hymn more of a Christian focus. He then asked Lyon if he could use the Jewish melody for the new hymn. Lyon gave him the music and Olivers named this hymn tune \\"Leoni\\" after Lyon. When he showed the new hymn to a friend, he annotated each line with scriptural references from The Bible. \\"The God of Abraham Praise\\" was first published as a leaflet titled \\"A Hymn to the God of Abraham\\" in 1772. It was later published nationwide by Wesley in the Methodist hymnal \\"Sacred Harmony\\". The hymn later made it to the United States after being published in Joshua Leavitt's \\"The Christian Lyre\\". The hymn was composed by Olivers with thirteen verses however later reprints of the hymn omit a number of them with the majority of hymn books using four verses. In the early 20th century in the United States, \\"The God of Abraham Praise\\" was often confused with \\"Praise To the Living God\\", another translation of \\"Yigdal\\" by Max Landsberg and Newton Mann. Several Presbyterian, Baptist and UCC hymnals misattributed \\"The God of Abraham Praise\\" to them instead of Olivers due to William Gannett recasting the work to change the title from \\"Praise to the Living God\\" to \\"The God of Abraham Praise\\". A number of versions of Methodist hymnals also made the same error until the 1980s.  Interfaith dialogue  The Judeo-Christian context of \\"The God of Abraham Praise\\" has caused the hymn to be used in interfaith services between Jews and Christians.

Nguyen explained in an interview with Mother Jones, ‚ÄúWe were on tour at the time so I could check out these burgeoning hubs of activity, and we came home and I thought, ‚ÄòIf I lay still through this, shame if I sleep tonight.‚Äô\\" The song ‚ÄúKindness Be Conceived,‚Äù featuring Joanna Newsom, had been written a month before Nguyen had met Newsom. \\"I wanted more of that old-time feel in the vocal harmonies. So when we met I shyly asked if she would demo. She did an amazing job, I‚Äôm so glad and grateful to have her on the record,\\" explained Nguyen. The two had met at a songwriters' retreat at Hedgenrook. Promotion To publicize the album, a series of short films were released, directed by Nguyen and Lauren Tabak. The short films included appearances by Ira Glass, John Hodgman and Merill Garbus of Tune-Yards. Reception The album received a largely positive critical reception. The SF Weekly described it as \\"socially conscious and brave, but...also a delight to listen to\\".Port, Ian S. (2013) \\"The Top 12 Bay Area Rock Albums of 2013\\", SF Weekly, December 25, 2013. Retrieved January 4, 2014 PopMatters described it as having a \\"big-tent sound\\", with Arnold Pan stating \\"the way We the Common gets across its open-minded, open-hearted attitude is a real triumph\\". Allmusic gave the album a four star rating, with Fred Thomas commenting on the broader lyrical focus compared to earlier work, and viewing it as Nguyen's \\"most mature work and coincidentally some of her most enjoyable\\". The NMEs Kevin Perry scored it 6/10, stating that there was \\"something sunkissed and wholesome\\" about it. Pitchfork Media's Lindsay Zoladz gave it 7.5 out of 10, calling it her \\"most sharply written record to date\\".

The hospitals were used to isolate Indigenous tuberculosis patients from the general population, because of a fear among health officials that \\"Indian TB\\" posed a danger to the non-Aboriginal population. Many of these hospitals were located on Indian reserves, and might also be called reserve hospitals, while others were in nearby cities. History  Indigenous populations had been hit by various diseases brought by European settlers and missionaries, including tuberculosis, smallpox, measles, mumps, diphtheria, typhoid, and influenza, from the 19th century onwards. These exposures to new diseases reduced the population by as much as 90%. At best, waves of infection are partially documented. Tuberculosis moved more slowly, but by 1950, one in five Inuit people were infected. Mortality rates in the 1930s and 1940s rose higher than 700 people per 100,000. Early hospitals for First Nations were mostly church-run, in a manner similar to the Indian residential schools. For example, the Grey Nuns opened a small hospital on the Blood reserve in southern Alberta in 1893 with the support of the Department of Indian Affairs, while the Church of England in Canada founded a hospital on the nearby Blackfoot reserve in 1896. Other \\"Indian annexes\\" (or \\"Indian wards\\" or \\"wings\\") were provided for segregated medical care, such as in the basements of hospitals for settler populations. Slowly, the Department of Indian Affairs took control of the hospitals away from the churches. The Blood hospital was replaced with a new structure paid for by the department in 1928, and the Blackfoot hospital was replaced in 1923, partially with funds taken from the band's trust fund. Government officials' request for the legal backing to forcibly remove Inuit and other Indigenous people from their communities is documented as far back as 1920. An amendment to the Indian Act was passed in 1927 to this effect. = National initiative = The newly-created federal Department of National Health and Welfare took over the building and running of Indian hospitals in 1946 as part of Canada's new welfare state policies following the Second World War. The national government began a large-scale operation, run under the auspices of the Advisory Committee for the Control and Prevention of Tuberculosis among Indians, to isolate and reduce the occurrence of the disease in northern populations. This included surveys of infection as well as forcible removal and confinement of those infected. The federal government made the choice not to build hospitals in the north but to evacuate infected individuals to the south of Canada and invest in facilities there. Several sanatoria, referred to as Indian Hospitals, were opened in Ontario and Quebec to accept evacuees, such as the Moose Factory Indian Hospital, opened in 1949, to \\"isolate the disease\\" on an island. The first state-run Indian Hospital was Charles Camsell Indian Hospital in Edmonton, opened in 1946 after converting an Indian residential school into a medical facility. By 1960, there were 22 federally-fun Indian hospitals. Most estimate that the cost of care in Indian hospitals was about half what settler patients received, often in segregated hospitals side by side. Part of the national operation were ships dedicated to carrying TB-infected passengers from Northern Canada to the sanatoria. One such ship was , part of the Eastern Arctic Patrol or Eastern Arctic Medical Patrol, a ship which was specially fitted after 1946 with medical facilities quarantined away from crew quarters, which ran from 1950 to 1969. The C. D. Howe had 30 beds for Inuit patients and crew space for 58, as well as a helicopter for transferring patients. The ships were equipped with x-ray technology to diagnose infections, and patients were marked on the hand with identifying numbers and the results of their tests. The Western Arctic Patrol mostly delivered patients to the hospital in Edmonton; the Eastern, to Hamilton. It was more common in western parts of the country to airlift patients than to ship them by water. Settler medical professionals believed the \\"Indian TB\\" was a strain that posed a threat to the settler population, misunderstanding at the time the process of immunity through exposure, and the Aboriginal populations' lack of resistance to the disease brought unknowingly by settler carriers. The Inuit populations was considered to be \\"racially careless\\" about their health and containing the spread of the disease. A particularly strong wave of the epidemic started in 1952. Canadian settler medical professionals attribute the spread of the disease, besides the Indigenous populations' lack of immunity, to overcrowded living conditions in Inuit communities - after forcible relocation by the Canadian government - and weakened constitutions through limited food supplies. Tuberculosis spread easily through the Inuit and First Nations populations, including in Canadian Indian residential schools, where healthy children were routinely exposed to infected children and poor sanitary conditions and ventilation contributed to the spread. In one school, the death toll was as high as 69%. In some residential schools, TB infection rates were as high as 80%; schools that held infected children due to overburdened hospitals were given a stipend to provide healthcare to their students of fifteen cents per child per day. In 1953, mortality rates from TB in the Inuit population was 298.1 per 100,000 patients, compared to 9.9 per 100,000 in southern and settler communities. It is estimated that by 1955, almost 1,000 Inuit people had been removed for treatment in southern Canada. In 1953 it was also made a crime for an Indigenous person to refuse treatment or to leave a hospital before being discharged. Patients who wished to return home to their communities were arrested and taken to jail or brought back to the hospitals. A 1983 study by S. Grzybowski and E. Dorken titled Turburculosis in Inuit found that: > In the 1950s tuberculosis became a grave problem with the mortality rate > approaching 1% per annum and the incident rate almost 3%. The annual risk of > infection has been estimated at 25% per annum. These are probably the > highest rates recorded anywhere in the world in the 20th century. Medical professionals continue to congratulate themselves on successfully stemming the tide of the disease through such interventions of forcible removal of infected individuals from their homes. At several points when rates of TB diagnosis lessened, the efforts to prevent the disease were defunded, resulting in an increase in infection rates again. Indian hospitals began being phased out in the late 1960s and every Indian hospital was closed or converted to desegregated institutions by 1981.  Conditions  = Diagnosis = Research conducted by Oloffson, Holson, and Partridge describes the conditions endured by Inuit communities during the diagnosis process: > Being told that they had to leave with the hospital boat or airplane to go > to a hospital in the South was a frightening experience for most of the > patients.... Many were diagnosed while still asymptomatic, and as such there > was often great confusion as to why they were being taken from their homes > and families. Even when they were aware of their condition, it was not > always made clear to the patients where they were being taken or if they > would ever be returned, contributing to an atmosphere of fear and > desperation. In some cases, Inuit who knew that they were seriously ill > would hide out on the land once they had heard that the hospital boat was > arriving. In these situations, a helicopter, originally intended to fly > ahead of the boat to check ice conditions or bring medical personnel to > shore if the boat could not dock, was used to survey the land, find anyone > hiding, and bring them to the boat for examination. Shawn Selway states that while leaving their homes for treatment was not mandatory, most Inuit people felt pressured in a way that could not be considered consensual. Because the skin test for TB was unreliable, diagnostic ships began to rely more on chest x-rays, exposing children and adults to yearly doses of radiation, for some community members over 40 years. In 1928, doctors who later ran the Fort Qu'Appelle Indian Hospital were given federal funding to develop drugs to fight the TB epidemic. In 1933, they began running experimental vaccination trials on Indigenous children from nearby communities. The vaccination was declared a success despite limited validation; there were also several problems, including a need to re-vaccinate every two years. Also, people vaccinated with the drug would test as false positives by the Mantoux skin test for TB that was in standard use, meaning successfully inoculated people would end up in hospital anyhow. In 1952 two inoculated girls tested positive for TB, but this was hushed up by government officials. By 1954, this vaccination was a mandatory treatment across Canada. = Removal = When an Indigenous person had a tuberculosis diagnosis confirmed, they were rarely allowed back into their communities until deemed free of tuberculosis. Evacuees could not go ashore to collect their belongings, say good-bye, or make arrangements for their families - children were often adopted by neighbours and family members in Inuit communities. > Children, even infants, who were diagnosed with TB would be taken from their > parents and sent with the boat. Men and women would be forced to leave their > families behind ... at times left without a father to hunt or a mother to > make clothes or care for the children. Evacuees in turn faced great > emotional distress, knowing that it would be difficult for their family to > survive without them. As exemplified in the quote above, so great was the > desperation, that the minister would often marry couples when one of them > had to leave for the hospital, in order to sanctify the union while there > was still time to do so. Fear of removal was a deterrent to getting tested, and even deterred remote Inuit from going to town while the ship was docked: > In 1955, RCMP reported that Inuit in the Kimmirut area were now avoiding the > settlement at shiptime because they had no desire of ‚Äúbeing evacuated to the > Land of No Return.‚Äù Medical ships' helicopters were sometimes used to seek out and forcibly pick up Inuit people who were hiding in rural areas. Some former patients assert that they were sent to sanatoria for treatment without actually testing positive for tuberculosis: > \\"[My mom] was told she had TB, but many years later, when she went to the > doctor, they said to her, 'No ‚Äî you would have had scars on your lungs,'\\" > Hunt said. Some researchers agree with this assessment, indicating that some Indigenous community members were forcibly removed from their land by means of a TB diagnosis: > Declaring individuals contagious was a good means of control, keeping them > out of trouble or out of circulation while the task of clearing the land was > underway. Some rates of removal of Indigenous people from their communities have been quoted as 5,240 Inuit people from 1953 and 1961, compared to a total population in the Eastern Arctic of about 11,500. The Nanaimo hospital saw 14,000 patients during its two-decade tenure. From 1950 to 1965, 1,274 Inuit and Cree patients were removed from their communities and placed in institutional care in Hamilton, Ontario alone. At this hospital, Inuit patients carved and sold around 200 soapstone pieces a month, with the hospital taking a 30% commission on all sales. The total value of Inuit art sold through this process was over $10,000CAD per year. Some researchers assert that hospitals kept patients interned for years or decades to increase government funding received, and to provide a supply of patients for experimental medical procedures. The average stay in sanatoria ranged depending on the availability of drug treatments introduced in the 1940s. In 1949, at the Mountain Sanatorium in Hamilton, a patient stayed for an average of 562 days; in 1956, the average stay was 332 days. = Hospital conditions = Many evacuees were sent to institutions with English- and French-speaking staff, which made communication difficult. It has been alleged that hospitals were staffed by foreign-trained doctors whose credentials were not recognized in Canada. In several hospitals, patients were referred to by assigned identification numbers, the disc number system, instead of their names. Low salaries, poor working conditions, and the isolated locations of many hospitals made it difficult to maintain adequate numbers of qualified staff. These hospitals also did not receive the same level of funding as facilities for non-Indigenous communities. Although treatment for tuberculosis in non- Indigenous patients improved during the 1940s and 1950s, these innovations were not propagated to the Indian hospitals. In hospitals such as the Queen Mary (Toronto), where settler and Indigenous children were treated side-by- side, a white former patient reports being given pills while Indigenous patients were given injections. There are high rates of reported depression in patients. People forcibly transported and confined in sanatoria were often given little information about their treatment and rights: > \\"Perhaps you are wondering why you are brought down from your home leaving > your friends and perhaps family behind. The reason is that you are sick, and > if you were left at home, you may endanger those at home. So you are here to > get well again‚Ä¶ But do not be afraid. Nobody here will harm you.\\"‚Äì Mountain > Views, Hamilton Sanatorium, 1955 Several hospitals were converted military buildings that were improperly equipped for their new use. Overcrowding was common and many patients were at risk of inadequate emergency exits in case of fire. Patients were often underfed or deprived of food and drink. Others report being forcefed unfamiliar foods, and being forced to eat their own vomit. Some patients were tied to their beds, including being tied face-down overnight, and suffered other abuses from hospital staff. One patient reports being tied to her bed for almost 24 hours a day for nine years: > \\"The only time we were untied was first thing in the morning to have a bath > and then change our pajamas and go back to bed.\\" ... She said the ties were > also taken off for meals they ate in the bed. If they needed to use the > bathroom, they were brought a bedpan. Most were on strict bed rest and some lost the ability to walk after several years of confinement. There are documented cases of hospital staff putting casts on the legs of patients who would not comply. > Drees said in cases of bone TB, the bacterium would make bones brittle, so > children and adults would be immobilized in full-body casts or strapped onto > stretchers to be still. Children who did such things as sit up in bed or put a foot on the floor were punished by being strapped, spanked, or being forced to wear a straitjacket for a period of time. > Whonnock recalled a time when she had chickenpox and was served turnips. The > smell made her ill and she threw up on her plate. A nurse hit her with a rod > and made her eat the vomit. There are survivor reports of sexual assault by hospital staff, including children being groped as a matter of course during monthly X-ray examinations, and a pre-teen having a sexual relationship with an adult orderly. Patients report being threatened and told not to talk about their experiences at the hospitals. At least one Indian hospital, the Fort William Sanatorium, served a dual use as a residential school, where TB-diagnosed children received education. Some rooms were converted for classroom use, and students who were bedridden received bedside lessons. This school received funding from the Department of Indian Affairs for its educational expenses. Reports indicate that \\"'at least one teacher provided education to Aboriginal children between 1942 and 1945'\\" and that it \\"housed a Provincial School starting as early as 1944 to as late as 1971, and an Indian Day School between 1950 and 1953.\\" Survivors of Fort William petitioned to have their cases included in the Residential Schools Settlement, but were denied as the sanatorium was not accepting patients primarily for educational purposes. = Surgery, drugs, and experimentation = From 1949 to 1953, 374 experimental surgeries were performed on TB patients, without the use of general anesthetic at the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital. In 1956, Charles Camsell Indian Hospital in Edmonton used its patients to test versions of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS); they also performed trials of a thyroid-stimulating hormone for a study of hypothyroidism in Indigenous people. Besides treatment with drugs, surgical procedures were performed on patients, including the intentional collapsing of lungs and removal of ribs, causing deformities. At Charles Camsell in Edmonton, medical staff used local anesthetic on Indigenous patients during such processes as chest surgery and rib removals, so that the patients would be awake and aware during the procedures. Other hospital patients report forced sterilization, with 125 sterilizations documented at the Charles Camsell hospital between 1971 and 1974. Some patients report that in the early stages of tuberculosis care, children were being used \\"as guinea pigs\\" for experimental treatment for the infection: = Discharge and death = Documentation was uneven at best; people's names were written down incorrectly, sometimes resulting in a cured patient being sent home to the wrong area, or the family of a dead patient not being notified. Many patients who returned home after their confinement found it difficult to readjust to their culture, having forgotten skills and languages. Two separate cases of babies being switched at birth (sent home with the wrong parents) at Norway House have been reported; these errors were only discovered many years later. Many of those who died while in treatment were buried in unmarked graves; many bodies were not returned to their families. One estimate puts the number of missing people and unreturned bodies at 700-800. A then-student of a nearby residential school remembers digging graves for tuberculosis victims from the Charles Camsell Hospital in Edmonton.  Legacy  Many northern communities still have high rates of infection for TB, despite improvements in vaccination in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In some cases, the rates of TB are 50% higher in the Inuit population compared to southern Canada. In Nunavut the rates are said to be 296 times higher for Inuit compared to non-Aboriginal people and that of the 25 communities in the territory at least 17 have TB cases, with Qikiqtarjuaq having 10% of the population infected. Rates in 2013 are similar to those found in 1953: > Overall, Canada consistently has a TB rate of fewer than 10 people per > 100,000. Among Inuit populations though, this rate is as high as 195 per > 100,000. That‚Äôs even higher than the global average, 122, and comparable to > rates in Afghanistan, India, and Bangladesh. However, by 2017 rates had risen to over 261 per 100,000. As in the case of the Indian residential schools, many family members and community members who had relatives in the Indian hospitals are still searching for closure after the deaths and disappearances of their loved ones, including looking for the locations of grave sites. Art created by evacuees in the sanatorium in Hamilton has been collected and donated to the Art Gallery of Hamilton. The Chedoke Hospital (formerly Mountain Sanatorium) had kept a set of 55 pieces created by its patients, which was brought up to 132 pieces through donations from buyers. The lot of 75 pieces of soapstone carvings in the collection of the AGH has been valued at $300,000CAD. = Apology = The Canadian government has yet to perform any reconciliatory efforts or offer apologies for the forcible confinement of Inuit people. Government officials have started to meet with Inuit representatives to discuss access to archival documents and begin the process. A federal program called Nanilavut has been performing research since 2008 and has identified at least partial records for over 4,500 evacuees. This database is being prepared for release as of fall 2017. As of October 2018, there are expectations of a future federal apology for the Indian hospital system. Discussions around an official apology were held in 2017 between the federal government and Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. The group is asking for help with identifying the graves of Inuit patients buried in the south of Canada, as well as counselling services for former patients and their descendants. The government has acknowledged a future apology but not confirmed a date or location. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issed an apology on March 8th, 2019, and announced a federal government project called \\"Nanilavut\\": > ... the Nanilavut initiative will be more than just an apology. > That means it will include measures, which have already started, aimed at > helping Inuit find the graves of family members who were transported to > southern Canada for TB treatment between the 1940s and the 1960s. = Lawsuit = In January 2018, a $1.1 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against the Canadian government to provide compensation for victims of Indian hospitals and their descendants. The lawsuit represented 30 former patients by the end of January 2018. This lawsuit also points to the inadequate care, physical and sexual abuse, and the long term negative health and psychological impacts associated with the hospitals.

This is in contrast to conventional digital signatures that are based on public-key cryptography and public-key infrastructure. With that, they assume that signers use their personal trusted computing bases for generating signatures without any communication with servers. Four different classes of server based signatures have been proposed: 1\\\\. Lamport One-Time Signatures. Proposed in 1979 by Leslie Lamport.Lamport, L.: Constructing digital signatures from a one way function. Comp. Sci. Laboratory. SRI International (1979) http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/dig-sig.pdf Lamport one-time signatures are based on cryptographic hash functions. For signing a message, the signer just sends a list of hash values (outputs of a hash function) to a publishing server and therefore the signature process is very fast, though the size of the signature is many times larger, compared to ordinary public-key signature schemes. 2\\\\. On-line/off-line Digital Signatures. First proposed in 1989 by Even, Goldreich and MicaliUS Patent #5,016,274. Micali et al. On-line/off-line digital signing. May, 1991. in order to speed up the signature creation procedure, which is usually much more time-consuming than verification. In case of RSA, it may be one thousand times slower than verification. On-line/off-line digital signatures are created in two phases. The first phase is performed off-line, possibly even before the message to be signed is known. The second (message-dependent) phase is performed on-line and involves communication with a server. In the first (off- line) phase, the signer uses a conventional public-key digital signature scheme to sign a public key of the Lamport one-time signature scheme. In the second phase, a message is signed by using the Lamport signature scheme. Some later works have improved the efficiency of the original solution by Even et al. 3\\\\. Server-Supported Signatures (SSS). Proposed in 1996 by Asokan, Tsudik and WaidnerAsokan, N., Tsudik, G., Waidner, M.: Server-supported signatures. J. Computer Security (1996) 5: 131143. in order to delegate the use of time- consuming operations of asymmetric cryptography from clients (ordinary users) to a server. For ordinary users, the use of asymmetric cryptography is limited to signature verification, i.e. there is no pre-computation phase like in the case of on-line/off-line signatures. The main motivation was the use of low- performance mobile devices for creating digital signatures, considering that such devices could be too slow for creating ordinary public-key digital signatures, such as RSA. Clients use hash chain based authentication to send their messages to a signature server in an authenticated way and the server then creates a digital signature by using an ordinary public-key digital signature scheme. In SSS, signature servers are not assumed to be Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) because the transcript of the hash chain authentication phase can be used for non repudiation purposes. In SSS, servers cannot create signatures in the name of their clients. 4\\\\. Delegate Servers (DS). Proposed in 2002 by Perrin, Bruns, Moreh and OlkinPerrin, T., Bruns, L., Moreh, J., Olkin, T.: Delegated cryptography, online trusted parties, and PKI. In 1st Annual PKI Research Workshop-Proceedings, pp. 97116 (2002) http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~pki02/Perrin/paper.pdf in order to reduce the problems and costs related to individual private keys. In their solution, clients (ordinary users) delegate their private cryptographic operations to a Delegation Server (DS). Users authenticate to DS and request to sign messages on their behalf by using the server's own private key. The main motivation behind DS was that private keys are difficult for ordinary users to use and easy for attackers to abuse. Private keys are not memorable like passwords or derivable from persons like biometrics, and cannot be entered from keyboards like passwords. Private keys are mostly stored as files in computers or on smart-cards, that may be stolen by attackers and abuse off-line. In 2003, Buldas and SaareperaBuldas, A., Saarepera, M.: Electronic signature system with small number of private keys. In 2nd Annual PKI Research Workshop- Proceedings, pp. 96108 (2003) proposed a two-level architecture of delegation servers that addresses the trust issue by replacing trust with threshold trust via the use of threshold cryptosystems.

The church has approximately 6,080 members.  History  After World War II, Hungarian people come to the United States. They established churches which were under control of the Reformed Church in their home country. In 1921 an agreement was made to be part of the American Reformed churches. This was the Tiffini Agreement. One part of these churches accepted this - today this is the Calvin Synod of the United Church of Christ - but not all. Dr Zoltan Kuthy a dean in New York and Rev. Endre Sebesty√©n dreamed of a separate Hungarian Reformed Church, this effort was widely supported. Independent Hungarian churches separated from these churches the first was the Independent Hungarian Reformed Church in Dubuque, Pennsylvania in 1924. The Independent Hungarian Reformed Church in America was formed. Five pastors signed the creation of this new denomination, Rev. Lajos N√°n√°ssy, Perth Amboy, NJ, Mih√°ly Kov√°cs, Detroit, MI, Endre Sebesty√©n, Duquesne, PA, K√°roly Vincze, Carteret, NJ, Gy√∂rgy Borsy-Kerekes, McKeesport, PA. In Dubuque they established a Presbytery. The dean was Endre Sebesty√©n, the janitor was Istv√°n Bodn√°r. Sister church relations was established with the Hungarian Reformed Church. In 1928 a General Assembly was held in Trenton, NJ and a second presbytery was created, this time the denomination consisted of 17 congregations and 12 pastors. The church had a newspaper, founded in 1921, this was the Hungarian Church (Magyar Egyh√°z - in Hungarian) The present name was adopted in 1958. The church follows the Hungarian model and elects a Bishop, and Deans for its three classes. They hold Synod meetings in every four years.  Statistics  Today there are 23 congregations, 11 mission churches, and 24 pastors.  Recent issues  The Hungarian Reformed community in America was refreshed by the refugees fleeing the Soviet crushing of the abortive revolution of 1956. Although the Hungarian Reformed Church in America has faced ageing and declining memberships, the church has more recently opened several new mission churches. The Hungarian Reformed Church in America applied for membership in the Reformed Church in Hungary in May 2009. Later the Hungarian Reformed Church in America voted to join the Reformed Church in Hungary. In the same year the church celebrated its 85th anniversary.

The strip started in 2001, and in 2002 Vehni√§inen submitted it to the Nordic comic strip contest in Kemi, where it made the finals but did not win. The name of the series parodies a well known Finnish nature documentary series, Avara luonto (\\"The ample nature\\"). Nowadays Kamala luonto is published in about 20 magazines and is one of the most popular comics in Finland. It is also published in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Setting Kamala luonto is a humorous comic strip about nature, starring various wild and tame animals. The animals' behaviour is more like that of real-world animals than is usually associated with humorous comic strips, the animals are noticeably less anthropomorphic. As an example of this, the two main characters, a weasel and a lynx, are predatory animals who enjoy hunting, and various strips show them eating their prey after they have killed it. The strips also involve some toilet humour, word play, breaking the fourth wall and popular culture references, such as to Alien and Garfield. Some of the characters, particularly the rabbits, often speak of going to \\"Iloinen Leskenlehti\\" (Finnish for \\"The Happy Coltsfoot\\") \\"for a few ones\\". The establishment is never shown, and what the characters actually consume there is left unmentioned. Characters * The weasel and the lynx are the main characters. They are good friends with each other, and share a passionate hobby: hunting, killing, and eating prey. They also like to joke with each other, and particularly enjoy flatulence jokes. * The fox is crazy but sympathetic. He isn't always so bright. * The bear is the king of the forest. He always gets his way because of his sheer size and strength. *The beaver is a loner and an introvert and becomes emotionally moved very easily. * The moose is, despite his bad luck, an eternal optimist. He is always desperately trying to find love. * The pig and the sheep are tame animals, who live in a human farm. They are unaware that they are only raised to be eaten, which causes constant amusement to the main characters. * The owl is a wise character, who acts as an advisor and counselor to the main characters. * Rabbits appear as stock prey characters, often shown already dead. But when alive, they are the philosophers of the forest. * Humans are rarely shown and are sometimes alluded to with their former possessions, such as rusting car wrecks or rotting carcasses of dogs. Their behaviour also is sometimes mentioned and commented, mostly being considered strange by the animals.

Life His father was a businessman and the head of the local Jewish community in Leipzig. Heinrich studied first Natural Sciences in Munich and Leipzig, and eventually awarded a Ph.D. in Geology. Only then he began the study of Medicine, graduating in 1892. Career He chose to specialize in Pediatrics under Prof. Otto Heubner, following him from Leipzig to Berlin, where Heubner had been appointed as the first professor of Pediatrics at the Charit√©. From 1901 to 1918 Finkelstein was the assistant medical director of the Berlin Asylum K√ºrassierstra√üe for Children and the Municipal Orphanage, where he combined medical skills with social commitment. In 1910 Finkelstein, together with Langstein, von Pfaundler, von Pirquet, and Salge, founded the Zeitschrift f√ºr Kinderheilkunde. In 1918, after the death of Adolf Aron Baginsky, he was appointed Medical Director of the Emperor and Empress Frederick Children's Hospital in Berlin. His scientific work was mainly on eating disorders, skin diseases and birth-related damage to the newborn. As medical director of the Emperor and Empress Frederick Children's Hospital, Finkelstein reduced the infant mortality rate to 4.3%, a value not to be exceeded in Germany until many decades later. His idea of a comprehensive public infant care was ahead of time, some of which was not realized until decades later. In 1905 he called for inter alia the extension of the statutory care for working pregnant women and new mothers, the introduction of an appropriate rest period before and after delivery, the free distribution of a \\"perfect\\" baby milk to the poor and the establishment of infant homes. Together with Ludwig Ferdinand Meyer, he developed the first artificial milk protein milk, thus saving the life of thousands of infants who suffered from eating disorders. Although respected and honored internationally as a pediatrician, being a Jew, he never received an Ordinary professorship and was only a lecturer at the Berlin University. On 1 March 1933, shortly before the Nazis gained power, he retired. But in 1935, he lost his teaching position and license to practice medicine. In 1936 he was invited as visiting professor to Chicago but soon returned to Berlin to be near his sister, his only family (he never married). The November pogrom of 1938 led him to leave Germany for good. Heinrich Finkelstein immigrated to Chile, but he was too old and too sick to start again from scratch. Salvador Allende, who later became Chile's president, was then the health minister, and put him an honorary pension which was withdrawn shortly after the fall of the government. Colleagues from the University of Santiago procured him a pro forma appointment as doorman to the Hospital, which secured him his daily bread. Nevertheless, in difficult cases, he kept being called as a consultant. Finkelstein's wrote a book on infant diseases (Lehrbuch der S√§uglingskrankheiten) that was printed both in German and Spanish, in which he summarized his experience and his vision of a holistic medicine. This work became a standard reference textbook for generations of pediatricians in Europe and Latin America, well into the postwar period. On 28 January 1942 Heinrich Finkelstein died in Santiago de Chile. Works *Heinrich Finkelstein: Der Laubenstein bei Hohen-Aschau.

Founded in 1966 by Bud Bushnell, the company operated independently until acquired by Terex in 2002. Genie operates in locations worldwide, headquartered in Redmond, Washington, United States. The company marked its 50th anniversary in 2016.  History  Genie Industries was founded in 1966 by Bud Bushnell. At the time, Bushnell was working for Seattle Bronze, a company that produced hoists in Kent, Washington. Bushnell bought the manufacturing rights to a material lift that operated on compressed air. Bushnell named the product Genie because he thought the hissing sound of the compressed air used to raise the machine's operator sounded like a genie rising from its bottle. The Genie Hoist was patented by Bushnell in 1968. In the 1970s, the company continued to grow with the addition several material- handling devices, including the Teletower and the company's first personal lift in 1978. In its early years, Genie manufactured products at a facility in Kirkland, Washington. In 1982, Genie moved its headquarters to Redmond, Washington. Today, the company continues to maintain its corporate headquarters, and three manufacturing facilities, in Redmond. After moving to the manufacturing facility in Redmond, Genie introduced the first Z-boom in 1984. In 1993, Genie introduced the IWP. The company followed up that introduction with the addition of scissor lifts in 1997, trailer-mounted boom in 1998 and rough-terrain scissor lifts in 1999. Also in 1998, Genie expanded its Washington state manufacturing footprint to Moses Lake. In 2002, Genie Industries was acquired by Terex Corporation, a global manufacturer of construction and industrial equipment. In the years following the sale, the Genie organization was transitioned over to the Terex Aerial Work Platforms (AWP) segment of Terex. All of the company's products are still sold and marketed under the Genie brand. The sale of the company led to Genie expanding its manufacturing ability to other parts of the world. Genie now has manufacturing facilities in China, Italy and the United Kingdom. The company employs more than 1,800 people in Redmond, Washington, and more than 3,800 worldwide.  Markets  Genie products are commonly used in aviation, construction, entertainment, government and military, industrial, warehousing and retail applications. The equipment rental industry accounts for 90 percent of all Genie product domestic sales and 80 percent of sales outside of the United States. Products Genie produces several types of construction lift equipment ranging from boom lifts, aerial work platforms, equipment handlers, scissor lifts, and material lifts.

It is a Church on the Chilo√© Island in Chilo√©, Chile. It is in the town of Nerc√≥n, about 4 km from the town of Castro. The Church was constructed around 1890, from cypress and larch wood. It is 40 metres long, 15 metres wide, and has a tower that stretches 25 metres high. Inside there is a sculpture of Saint Michael with a demon at his feet that was made with only one piece of wood, and the interior paint makes it appear as though it were marble. The patron saint days celebrated at this Church include the Our Lady of Grace on 8 September and Saint Michael the Archangel on 29 September. It was declared a National Monument by the Chilean government 27 July 1984. It is one of the 16 Churches of Chilo√© that were declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites on 30 November 2000. The Church began a process of restoration in January 2012. The architect of the restoration was Katerine Araya, and the head carpenter is Sim√≥n C√°rcamo. The Church is considered an exemplar of Chilo√©'s traditional architecture. The Church that stands today is not the original one, because it was rebuilt in 1879. Construction was completed in 1895. When the restoration of the Church commenced and the foundation was examined, the architect's team found bone fragments and skulls under the foundation of the Church. The Council of National Monuments was informed. Araya affirmed that the findings would be treated according to the Law of National Monuments which has stipulations for archeological findings. The decision to remove the cupola of the Church generated controversy. Also the cypress and larch woods are unavailable, so the rotting wood will be replaced with other, more common woods, which is generating controversy among residents. As much of the original wood will be reused, however. The problem occurs because of the constant rains in Chilo√©.

Built in 1983 in Czechoslovakia, it diverts water around a dam at Troja on the Vltava river in Prague. Its two unique features are its use of car and truck tires as flow diverters and its shallow slope, closer to 1% than the usual nearly 2% for such venues. Despite these characteristics, the Troja facility has hosted ten World Cup races and one World Championship in the 21 years 1992-2012, and the 2013 World Championships. The mid-course bridge and below. For competitions, the sloped right bank is covered with bleachers. Foreground, the iconic truck tire water diverters. Background, the Troja dam on the Vltava river. Venue The artificial whitewater course on the Vltava river near Prague, used for canoe slalom training and competition. The channel walls are vertical, with flow diverters constructed of automobile and truck tires stacked side-by-side to form large cylinders attached to the bottom by beams running through the tires. Large truck tires are used at the channel sides, where they often breach the surface. In the center of the flow are smaller automobile tires which remain submerged, and shallow-sloped ramps. In several spots, new concrete platforms have been installed in the channel bed to receive moveable RapidBlocs, like the ones at the Lee Valley White Water Centre used for the London 2012 Summer Olympics. The original water diverters, made from vehicle tires filled with concrete, have been completely replaced by adjustable plastic RapidBlocs. These new plastic wave-shapers, just above the mid-course bridge, use RapidBlocs to create a standing wave for freestyle surfing tricks. There are four wing dams on the right and five on the left. At the location of the mid-course bridge, two wing dams are directly across from each other, narrowing the channel by one third. Just below the bridge is a concrete boulder in the channel center, connected to the right bank by a barrier that blocks all flow to the right, effectively narrowing the channel by half. 2013 World Championship gates Gate map for Semi- & Finals of the 2013 World Championship race, September 13.

He was among the leading figures in Egypt before the 1970s. Early life and education Badran was born in 1929. He attended military academy and graduated in 1948. Career Badran was the head of the military security services in the mid 1960s. He also served as the office manager of then-Field Marshal Abdul Hakim Amer under the Nasser's rule. He was one of the top aides of Amer. Then Badran was appointed minister of defense in Fall 1966 shortly before the 1967 War or Six Day War, replacing Abdel Wahab Al Bishri in the post. Amer had supported his appointment. Badran was also named as the chief of Nasser's cabinet the same year. On 25 May 1967, Badran visited Moscow and met senior Soviet officials, including then prime minister Alexei Kosygin, to secure their support regarding Israeli threat. He resigned from office during the war, and was replaced by Amin Howeidi as defense minister in June 1967. =Arrest and trial= Badran along with other senior officials, including Amer, was detained on 25 August 1967 due to the accusations of plotting against Nasser. However, they were tried about their roles in cease fire in the six day war in 1968. In fact, Badran was twice tried. He and Salah Nasr, former chief of intelligence and also part of Amer's faction, were convicted and sentenced to hard labor due to their roles in the defeat. =Allegations= The Muslim Brotherhood figures accused him and his chief, Abdul Hakim Amer, of being responsible for the torture of then Brotherhood leaders who had been arrested due to their alleged plans to assassinate Nasser in 1965. Personal life Badran left Egypt and began to live in London. His wife whom he divorced worked at the American University in Cairo.

It was an army encampment (Lat.: castellum) on the Old Rhine (at the time the major branch of the river Rhine), on the northern border of the Roman Empire, the limes. Praetorium Agrippinae is mentioned on the Tabula Peutingeriana between the castella of Matilo in the east and Lugdunum Batavorum to the west. History Palaeogeographic map of the Cananefatian area in the Roman period superimposed on South Holland today, showing the location of Praetorium Agrippinae. =Castellum= A praetorium is a military headquarters, and Praetorium Agrippinae takes its name from the mother of the emperor Caligula, Vipsania Agrippina, who died in 33 AD.

Romeinen in Valkenburg (ZH), de opgravingsgeschiedenis en het archeologische onderzoek van Praetorium Agrippinae. Leiden, Hazenberg Archeologie The fort was built in the current centre of Valkenburg, and was at first fortified by a palisaded earthen wall and three moats. Initially, two maniples (or four centuriae) of legionaries and two turmae of cavalry from the cohors III Gallorum Equitata were stationed at the fort. After the Revolt of the Batavi (69-70 AD), however, when the local tribes had razed the fortress to the ground, the entire cohors IV Thracum was relocated here. Around 180 AD the Romans enlarged the fort and rebuilt it in stone. In total, 7 building phases have been distinguished. Like all other forts on the Dutch limes, Valkenburg was deserted after the collapse of the Roman border defense around 275 AD. Valkenburg, however, is one of the few castella where evidence for Late Roman building activities was found. During the reign of Constantius I Chlorus a granary was constructed here for the shipment of grain to Britannia. 1977\\\\.

With repeated trips, 100 tons of equipment and ammunition, 28 heavy vehicles and about 500 men made the crossing. The ferries were rafts about . The wooden platforms were supported by canoes and empty diesel barrels, and pulled by a boat with an outboard engine. Incident By the early morning of the 6 February only the rearguard of 100 to 120 men remained on the south shore. These men all piled onto one raft to make the last crossing. In the middle of the river, the raft tipped to one side, throwing several men into the water, then tipped to the other side, throwing more men in. The raft was seriously overloaded, with the weight poorly distributed. The tipping may have triggered by an explosion creating a panic. However, one survivor says there was no firing, and another pointed out that the troops were accustomed to mortar fire and would not have reacted. Another possibility is that the boat pulling the raft accelerated too fast. Wearing boots and uniform, weighed down with arms and ammunition, many of the men sank immediately. When the raft reached the other bank the extent of the disaster was realised: 47 Portuguese soldiers and five Guinean militia from the Madina do Bo√© garrison had died. Aftermath About two weeks later, an operation was launched using marines and navy divers to try to recover the bodies, which were already in an advanced state of decomposition. Many were not recovered; those that were received a formal military burial beside the river. In February 2010 a team of researchers from the Faculty of Science and Technology in the University of Coimbra exhumed and tried to identify the bodies of between fifteen and seventeen of the soldiers who had been buried in a mass grave from the river. The skeletons were in poor condition due to the very high humidity levels, complicating the job of separating and identifying them. The exhumation was promoted by the League of Combatants of Portugal (Liga dos Combatentes de Portugal) under a program named \\"Conservation of Memories\\".

Its administrative center is located in the urban-type settlement of Vinkivtsi. Its population was 31,058 as of the 2001 Ukrainian Census and Geography The Vinkivtsi Raion is located in the eastern part of the Khmelnytskyi Oblast, corresponding to the modern-day boundaries of the Podolia historical region. It borders upon the neighboring Bar Raion of Vinnytsia Oblast. Its total area constitutes . Accordingly, the district occupies 3.39 percent of the oblast's total area, and 2 percent of its population. History The Vinkivtsi Raion was first established on March 7, 1923 as part of a full-scale administrative reorganization of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. On October 31, 1927, its administrative center Vinkivtsi was renamed Zatonsk in honor of Volodymyr Zatonsky, a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. Accordingly, the district was renamed to the Zatonskyi Raion (), a name which it kept until 1938 when both the town and district reverted to their original names. The Vinkivtsi Raion existed up until it was dissolved in on December 30, 1962. After it was dissolved, its territory was at first annexed by the neighboring Yarmolyntsi Raion; its former territory was later divided between the Nova Ushytsia and Derazhnia Raions. A decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet dated December 8, 1966 again re-established the Vinkivtsi Raion. Administrative divisions The Vinkivtsi Raion is divided in a way that follows the general administrative scheme in Ukraine. Local government is also organized along a similar scheme nationwide. Consequently, raions are subdivided into councils, which are the prime level of administrative division in the country. Each of the raion's urban localities administer their own councils, often containing a few other villages within its jurisdiction. However, only a handful of rural localities are organized into councils, which also may contain a few villages within its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Vinkivtsi Raion is divided into: * 1 settlement council‚Äîmade up of the urban- type settlement of Vinkivtsi (administrative center) * 17 village councils Overall, the raion has a total of 36 populated localities, consisting of one urban-type settlement, and 35 villages.

In a racing career which lasted from 1953 until 1955 he ran twenty-three times and won nine races. After showing good, but unexceptional form in his first two seasons, he improved significantly in the summer of 1955 and ended his career with a record-breaking win in the Portland Handicap. Having been awarded one of the highest Timeform figures of the decade, Princely Gift was retired to stud at the end of the season and had considerable success as a sire of winners. Background Princely Gift was a bay horse with no white markings bred by Major Alfred Allnat. He was one of the last crop of European foals sired by Nasrullah before the stallion was exported to the United States. His dam, Blue Gem was a daughter of The Derby winner Blue Peter, giving Princely Gift a pedigree more typical of a middle-distance horse rather than of the sprinter he became. As a yearling, Princely Gift was sent to the sales where he was bought for 5,000 guineas by Sir Victor Sassoon. The colt was sent into training with Noel Murless at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career As a two- year-old, Princely Gift showed some useful form, notably when finishing second, beaten a short head by the future 2000 Guineas winner Darius in the July Stakes. He also finished second in a valuable race at York and won the Clearwell Stakes at Newmarket. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the season's best British juveniles, he was given a weight of 121 pounds, twelve pounds below the top-rated Our Babu. At the end of the season he was sent to the sales but failed to reach his reserve price, and so remained in Sassoon's ownership. In 1954 Princely Gift established himself a good sprint handicapper by winning the Ditton Sprint at Sandown Park, giving the twenty-six time champion jockey Gordon Richards the last win of his career. Towards the end of the season, Princely Gift began to show improved form and at Newmarket in October he recorded his first important weight-for-age win. Ridden by Lester Piggott, he won the six furlong Challenge Stakes at odds of 2/1. Princely Gift's early form in 1955 was unremarkable, and he ran poorly in the Wokingham Stakes at Royal Ascot. From this point on he showed his best form and won his three remaining races impressively. In July he won the Chichester Stakes at Goodwood and in the following month he added a victory in the Hungerford Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse. At Doncaster in September he was assigned a weight of 130 pounds Portland Handicap. He won easily by four lengths, setting a new course record. Assessment The independent Timeform awarded Princely Gift a peak rating of 137 in 1955, making him their highest- rated older horse of the season and the equal third highest British-trained horses of the 1950s. Despite his lofty rating, he was not the top sprinter of the year, that honour going to the three-year-old Pappa Fourway. (139). In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Princely Gift the second best British or Irish-trained horse of his generation, behind The Derby winner Never Say Die. He was also rated the eleventh-best British or Irish-trained sprinter of the 20th century. Stud record Princely Gift proved to be a highly successful breeding stallion. His best winners included Floribunda, So Blessed (July Cup, Nunthorpe Stakes), Faberge (second in the 2,000 Guineas, sire of Rheingold and Giacometti), Tesco Boy (six times Leading sire in Japan), Tribal Chief (New Stakes, sire of Mrs McArdy) and Sun Prince (St. James's Palace Stakes, Queen Anne Stakes). Princely Gift died in 1973. Pedigree *Princely Gift was inbred 3 x 4 to Blandford, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree. He was also inbred 4 x 4 to Phalaris.

Synopsis Michael Rostof, a young officer serving in the Tsar's army in pre-1914 St. Petersburg, strikes up a deep emotional bond with Nina Petrovna. Only later does he discover she is the kept mistress of the influential Colonel Beranoff. She chooses to give up the luxurious existence that Beranoff offers her, in order to live with the much poorer Rostof. Although they can not even pay their electricity bills on time they are both incredibly happy. Beranoff is enraged by his lover's decision to spurn him and he plots his revenge. One night in the officer's mess he traps Rostof into cheating at cards. When Rostof is confronted, he resolves to take the honourable way out. When Petrovna is informed, in order to save her lover's career and life, she agrees to abandon Rostof and go back to Beranoff. The Colonel in turn agrees to destroy the incriminating evidence. To hide the real reason from him, Petrovna pretends to abandon Rostof because he cannot afford to supply her with expensive clothes and jewels, sneering at his well meaning gift of some shoes. Rostof is left heartbroken, while Petrovna is secretly anguished. At the end of the film, as his regiment rides out of St. Petersburg, Rostof symbolically ignores a rose thrown to him from her balcony by Petrovna. Shortly afterwards when Beranoff arrives to call on Petrovna in expectation of resuming their relationship, he discovers she has killed herself- wearing the shoes Rostof brought her.

Professional activities  Her early education was in Europe but by 1895 she was back in the United States and working at Columbia University with Nathaniel Lord Britton, who with his wife Elizabeth Gertrude Britton, was the founding force behind the New York Botanical Garden. In January 1900, she became the first librarian of the newly founded Bronx institution's library, a post she held until September 1907.List of Staff Members New York Botanical Garden 1896 to 1939, J. NY Botanical Garden, vol 41 #485, May 1940 While in New York, she was the author of over a dozen scientific papers (see bibliography). Her notes, preserved in the Archives and Manuscripts collection of the New York Botanical Garden, include sketches of some of the plants she studied. In 1903 Vail traveled to Paris, France, for an auction of the botanical literature of the late Professor Claude Thomas Alexis Jordan. She obtained over 400 items, including ten volumes of John Sibthorp's Flora graeca. Vail wrote on numerous botanical topics; for example, her 1898 co-authored work (with Elizabeth Gertrude Britton, among others), details \\"New or Rare Mosses\\", such as Anacamptodon Splachnoides. An account in the records of the New York Botanical Garden presents Vail's resignation from the Garden's Library as resulting from her indignation of being accused of smoking cigarettes in the library. However, this account is disputed by a letter in the files of Nathaniel Lord Britton dated September 28, 1907, which mentions her departure as being due to an extended separation from her mother, who was living in France. This letter indicates no ill will.Anna Murray Vail Papers, Mertz Library, New York Botanical Garden, http://www.nybg.org/library/finding_guide/archv/vail_ppf.html, accessed January 25, 2017. Pen & ink sketch of Cynanchum sp by Anna Murray Vail. This was created by Ms. Vail in 1899 when she was librarian at the New York Botanical Garden. In 1911 she moved to France. During World War I, she became active in the American Fund for French Wounded, eventually becoming its treasurer.American Fund for French Wounded Monthly Report, Vol II, Sept ‚Äì Oct 1917, Nos. 21 ‚Äì 22 A letter to the head of the U.S.-based organization, Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer, was published in The New York Times. The letter reads, in part, > Every department of the Red Cross has borrowed nurses and aids, and we of > the American Fund have given everything we had for the emergency. If it gets > worse, I shall offer my own services, for I can make beds and clean up, and > no part of the work will terrify me, even if I am not a trained nurse.  Later years  While living in France she acquired a house in Hericy. Here she would spend her remaining years, continuing her work as a librarian until blindness forced her to stop. She died in Vieux Logis on December 18, 1955, and is buried in the municipal cemetery at Hericy. Taxonomy  Bibliography  *Vail, Anna Murray. A Study of the Genus Galactia in North America.

Broadcast live on December 31, 2012 from outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, the special included comedy sketches, interviews with celebrities and others in attendance, and live musical performances by Macy Gray and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. The special was aired locally on the Orange County-based independent station KDOC-TV, and was also broadcast by the Sacramento MyNetworkTV affiliate KQCA. After its broadcast, First Night became infamous for its low quality, as exhibited in a montage of scenes from the special that became popular after being discovered by comedian Patton Oswalt. The special suffered from many technical problems (including microphone gaffes and communication issues), featured scenes described as being \\"surreal\\", the very New Year being counted in too late and spontaneously ended with an impromptu fight breaking out on stage over the credits. Based on the montage, several media outlets declared First Night to be the \\"worst New Year's Eve special ever\\". Kennedy defended the special in an interview with The New York Times, by claiming that First Night was an \\"anti-New Year's Eve show\\" which was intentionally unrehearsed and unpredictable. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin would praise the special for meeting Kennedy's stated goal. Production Grauman's Chinese Theatre Kennedy suggested the idea of hosting a New Year's special on KDOC-TV in November 2012 whilst watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with a friend from the station. Following Thanksgiving, he quickly used the final weeks of the year to attract sponsors and guests for the program (such as the restaurant chain Carl's Jr., which served as its primary sponsor). In planning the special, Kennedy was influenced by the style of Jerry Lewis's MDA telethon, promising a broadcast which would be \\"fun and spontaneous\\" and leave viewers guessing what would happen next. He intended First Night to be an \\"anti-New Year's Eve show\\" with an informal block party atmosphere, held at what he considered to be Hollywood's \\"apex of craziness\\", Hollywood Boulevard in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Synopsis Kennedy opened the special with a comedy monologue, which among others, included a joke relating to the \\"percentages\\" of 2012 (the 99%, 47%, and the 8% score of his last film on Rotten Tomatoes), along with joking that because of Psy, the packaging of a fortune cookie would no longer be the only thing people think about when they hear the words \\"Asian rapper\\". The special was plagued with technical problems throughout the night: a camera shot of Kennedy lingering on-stage was shown at the beginning of an interview with Shannon Elizabeth by Stu Stone, and issues with walkie-talkies affected the level of communication between the show's crew (also leading to several occasions where Kennedy was unsure of whether the show was live). Although several fleeting expletives from open microphones were also broadcast during the special, they were also caused by technical faults and were not intentional. Jessi Cruickshank (who hosted The CW's game show Oh Sit! alongside Kennedy) interviewed guests throughout the show, such as actor Drake Bell and Olympic gold medalist Dawn Harper. As part of an interview outside a local nightclub, Bridget Marquardt was encouraged by Cruickshank to eat a Turkey Jalape√±o burger from show sponsor Carl's Jr. in a sexually suggestive manner. Kennedy also starred in a pre-recorded comedy sketch promoting Commerce Casino; where he played a Mayan chief trying to win back his fortune by participating in a poker tournament. Prior to the arrival of midnight, singer Macy Gray performed \\"I Try\\", along with a medley of other songs. Due to her slurred speech and an occurrence where she thought that the time was only 11:15 p.m. instead of 11:50 p.m., it was speculated by critics that Gray may have been drunk during the performance. Kennedy has personally denied that this was the case, however. During the countdown to 2013, Kennedy was unable to find a clock, and the cast's countdown to 2013 was completed 10 seconds late. Following midnight, the rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony performed their songs \\"1st of tha Month\\" and \\"Notorious Thugs\\". Near the end of the special, Kennedy interviewed a pair of African-American women (one of whom claimed her New Year's resolution was to \\"get rid of all my haters\\") and quipped to one of them that \\"going white\\" instead of \\"black\\" would \\"keep [her] vagina very tight\\", followed later by a comedy sketch involving puppets making jokes regarding rape. Whilst signing-off at the end of the show, Kennedy declared that the show was \\"ending with a fight\\"; as promised, a fight began to break out on-stage. Reception Footage from the special became popular following its discovery by comedian Patton Oswalt. Following its broadcast, Burbank-based actor and comedian Shaun Broyls posted footage from the special on YouTube. When the footage was posted on Twitter by fellow comedian Patton Oswalt, the footage quickly became popular, and was picked up by a number of blogs and news outlets. Broyls himself believed that \\"there was no way that this broadcast was meant to turn out the way it turned out\\" due to the large number of technical problems that were seen throughout First Night, but acknowledged that the special may have a \\"rough charm\\" similar to that of B-movies or The Star Wars Holiday Special. Professional wrestler Adam Pearce attended the event in person, but did not notice any abnormalities aside from the fight at the end. Pearce did not rule out the possibility that certain aspects of the show were intentionally designed to increase the possibility of disorder. The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin (who dubbed the special The Jamie Kennedy Falling Apart At The Seams New Year's Eve 2013 Spectacular) supported Kennedy's assertion that First Night was an antithesis to other similar specials, suggesting that \\"if [Dick Clark] is the trusted authority figure who made sure everything went swimmingly, Kennedy is more like the creepy uncle whose idea of discipline and order is making the 15-year-olds he hangs out with promise they‚Äôll get good and drunk before playing with the illegal fireworks he‚Äôs bought them.\\" Rabin criticized Kennedy's opening monologue for potentially being anti-comedy or just bad material, and his confrontational attitude towards the audience throughout the show. Jessi Cruickshank was critiqued for her \\"over-the-top\\" recognition of Drake Bell's nine Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards (which Rabin joked that, in the opinion of the show, was equivalent to winning an Academy Award, ESPY, Grammy, Nobel Prize, and Tony in the same year), and interviews with Dawn Harper and Bridget Marquardt that he felt were \\"clearly a set up for a plug for Carl‚Äôs Jr.\\" Kennedy was also panned for his Commerce Casino sketch, which Rabin felt was \\"racist in its grotesque minstrelsy of Native American culture\\", and not funny. He also felt that Macy Gray's performance was \\"shambling yet strangely majestic\\" (speculating that she, and the rest of the production staff, may have been drunk), and felt that the performance by Bone Thugs-n-Harmony would have been a \\"muddy, dispiriting dirge\\" even without a backing track. In conclusion, however, Rabin praised the special for its unexpectedly surreal nature, considering it \\"the least professional and most entertaining New Year‚Äôs Eve broadcast I have ever seen.\\" In a later article in December 2013, The A.V. Club named Jamie Kennedy as one of \\"8 pretenders to Dick Clark's New Year's Eve throne\\", remarking that in comparison to the other seven personalities listed, \\"few hosts, though, have matched Jamie Kennedy's spectacular failure on the Orange County station KDOC last year\\", and concluded that \\"As 'Auld Lang Syne' played over on ABC, Kennedy reminded the world that some auld acquaintances really should be forgot.\\" References Category:New Year's television specials Category:Local television programming in the United States Category:2010s American television specials Category:Viral videos ","title":"First Night 2013 with Jamie Kennedy"},{"id":"38376387","text":"Ferenc N√°dasdy (1 July 1937 ‚Äì 15 January 2013)Meghalt N√°dasdy Ferenc gr√≥f Index.hu was a Hungarian aristocrat, the last male member of the House of N√°dasdy.

Erehtyneet syd√§met was released in April 1944, with Uotila and Eero Lev√§luoma sharing the director's credits. Later that year, Yrj√∂ Norta directed a film Hiipiv√§ vaara. Norta directed five of Fenno- Filmi's 18 films. Roland af H√§llstr√∂m made his first Fenno-Filmi effort Houkutuslintu in 1946. He soon became the head director for the company, a position which he later kept in Fennada-Filmi as well. Edvin Laine, Jorma Nortimo and Teuvo Tulio were some of the other directors who worked for Fenno- Filmi. The company was not able to produce commercially successful films and suffered from financial problems since the beginning. When Mauno M√§kel√§ became the head of the company in 1949, efforts were made to merge the productions of Fenno-Filmi and Adams Filmi.

The annual right-wing marches in the beginning of February peaked in 2007 and in 2009 with about 6,500 participants.http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/artikel.asp?id=2281445 With the marches a broad coalition of right-wing groups, old and new Nazis declared to remember the bombing of Dresden by Allied Forces at the end of World War II on the weekend after the anniversary of the bombings on February 13, 1945. In contrast to other cities in Germany resistance against the marches from civil society and left-wing groups had been relatively weak for years. With the emergence of the \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" alliance (Dresden without Nazis), the Nazi march was blocked from marching for the first time in 2010 by thousands of demonstrators, again in 2011 and prevented entirely in 2012. Political context: A conservative state and city While part of East Germany, Dresden was in the so-called \\"valley of the clueless\\" (Tal der Ahnungslosen), with its citizens out of the reach of the Western radio and television that citizens elsewhere in the East were able to listen to illegally. Dresden continued to be different after the German reunification; while most states in eastern Germany have been governed by varying coalitions, often involving the former SED, renamed Party of Democratic Socialism, Saxony was governed by the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). From 1999 to 2009: The emergence of the Neo-nazi demonstration In the mid-1990s small groups of neo-Nazis first mingled with Dresdenites of other political backgrounds that remembered the event at the site of the former Dresden Frauenkirche, which was destroyed during the bombing. In 1999 about 150 neo-Nazis held their first own manifestation to \\"remember\\" the bombing of Dresden. The marches that became an annual tradition in the subsequent years were officially organized and registered by the \\"Junge Landsmannschaft Ostdeutschland\\" (JLO, \\"Youth Corps of Eastern Germany\\"). In the next years the group organized the \\"mourning march\\" together with the neo-Nazi party National Democratic Party of Germany (National Demokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD)) and the \\"Freie Kr√§fte\\" (Free Forces), groups of neo-Nazi activists that are not party members. Between 2000 and 2009 the \\"mourning march\\" grew bigger and bigger to become \\"Europe's biggest Nazi demonstration\\".http://www.sz- online.de/nachrichten/artikel.asp?id=2281445, for a complete chronicle see Alexa Anders in: http://www.akweb.de/ak_s/ak568/Dresden_Speciale_2012.pdf By 2009 the participation had grown to peak with nearly 7,000. Delegations from far-right wing groups and parties from all over Europe attended. One particular reason for the growth in attendance was that other \\"big\\" Nazi demonstrations like those in Halbe and Wunsiedel were successfully blocked by anti-fascist protesters or forbidden by the authorities.Alexanda Anders, http://www.akweb.de/ak_s/ak568/Dresden_Speciale_2012.pdf The annual marches in Dresden had grown to an important event for the Nazi scene in Germany. On this day the numerous divisions in the scene and its problems were forgotten and the scene could see itself as powerful. Through commemorating those who died in the 1945 bombing of Dresden, a positive reference to National Socialism could be established to strengthen the own Nazi identity.http://nopasaran.site36.net/aufruf-2/ In 2007 neo-Nazis from the \\"Freie Kr√§fte\\" criticized the remembering as ritualized and hollow and organized their own regionally planned and mobilized demonstration in Dresden, by 2010 this had grown to a \\"week of action\\" in which Nazis handed out leaflets and did little agit-prop actions. Thus in the following years Dresden had one small demonstration on the evening of 13 February or a day before organized by the \\"Freie Kr√§fte\\" and a big demonstration organized by the JLO on 13 February or the next Saturday or Sunday if 13 February was not on a weekend.Alexanda Anders, http://www.akweb.de/ak_s/ak568/Dresden_Speciale_2012.pdf Early protest against neo-Nazis in Dresden On the radical left, political and ideological infighting between one faction then dominating in Dresden, the \\"Anti-Germans\\" and anti-imperialist and other anti-fascists, divided and preoccupied the Antifaschistische Aktion. Slogans like \\"Bomber Harris, do it again\\" which sought to interrupt and to criticize the commemorating of the bombing isolated the protest of the \\"Anti-Germans\\". Most national anti-fascist groups as well as the \\"ordinary\\" Dresdenites could not be mobilized with this provocative tactic. The most notable act was a blockade of several hundred demonstrators, on the Carola Bridge in 2006, causing the Nazi march to change its route. Most of the time, however, the Nazis could march without much protest. Most of the time the protest was too little to influence the Nazi demonstration significantly, or prevent it. In Dresden, the ruling Christian Democrats and the Free Liberals tended to ignore the Nazis and instead opted for a \\"silent commemorating\\" of the victims of the bombings, protest against the Nazis was seen as an intrusion, as an unwanted annoyance and political extremism on a day meant to belong to remembering the victims of the bombings. The official commemoration ceremony consisted of the laying down of wreaths on a monument at Dresdens \\"Heidefriedhof\\" cemetery where most of the victims of the bombings are buried. For several years this event in which all political parties of the city and its religious congregations participated was attended by members and supporters of the neo-Nazi party NPD.http://www.slideshare.net/lordofwinds/geh-denken-alliance Counter protest (2009) In 2008 both anti-fascist groups that operated nationally and liberal parties, concluded that the annual Nazi march in Dresden was no longer a regional issue, but had way outgrown this limited importance by becoming the biggest gathering of Nazis in Germany. Thus, both groups organized protest against the Nazi marches in Dresden nationally. The first did so with the formation of national coalition of antifascist groups. \\"No Pasaran\\", an antifascist slogan that originated during the Spanish Civil War, was its program and name. \\"This year we have federated as a preparatory alliance to approach the issues of Feb, 13th in a new way,\\" announced one antifascist group of the alliance.http://dresden1302.noblogs.org/post/2008/10/25/welcome/ It also sought to distance itself from the protest-repertoires of the \\"Antideutschen\\" by proclaiming \\"We won't stand for the cheap celebrating of war dead\\". Instead it aimed to organize a \\"big antifa demo organized together with antifascist organizations from all over Germany on February 14th 2009\\".http://dresden1302.noblogs.org/post/2008/10/25/welcome/#more-3 Liberal Parties including the Green Party, the Social Democrats and the Left Party, together with their youth organizations, the German Associations of Unions (DGB), the Protestant church, the Jewish Congregation of Dresden and several liberal foundations formed the alliance \\"Geh Denken\\" (Go and Think/Commemorate). It sought to set a \\"Clear STOP to Right-wing extremism\\" in a \\"peaceful and non-violent way\\".http://www.geh- denken.de/joomla/2009/selbstverstaendnis.html, see as well: http://www.geh- denken.de/joomla/2009/international.html It collected 200 initial signatories for its call to action; 10,000 people signed the call during the campaign.http://www.slideshare.net/lordofwinds/geh-denken-alliance Absent from this coalition were the Christian Democrats that run the city. On 14 February \\"No Pasaran\\" organized a demonstration said to comprise 2,500 (according to the police) and 4,000 peaceful antifascists (according to the organizers) from across Germany attending in the inner-city of Dresden. The demonstration was dominated and led by a large black bloc and was closely monitored and accompanied by the police. At the end of its official route the demonstration tried unsuccessfully to break through police lines to unite with the demonstrations of the \\"Geh Denken\\" alliance. With the use of bats and pepper spray the police prevented any attempts of groups of antifascists to get close to the gathering point of the Nazis after the dispersal of the demonstration.http://www.spiegel.de/video/protest-gegen-nazi-gedenkmarsch- dresden-zeigt-flagge-video-51541.html Not far away 12,000 people came together when three demonstrations organized by \\"Geh Denken\\" joined at the historic Schlo√üplatz to hear speeches and performances by several artists. Among the protesters were Franz M√ºnthefering (Chairman, Social Democrats), Claudia Roth (Chairwoman, The Greens), Gregor Gysi (Chairman, The Left) and Michael Sommer (head of the German Associations of Unions). It was the start of the \\"super election year of 2009\\" with several federal and the national elections coming, thus the mentioned politicians wanted to show their opposition to neo- Nazis.http://www.geh-denken.de/joomla/2009/international.html In evaluations of the day on group of the No Pasaran network spoke of a \\"moldy after taste\\" despite a \\"successful mobilization\\".http://www.akweb.de/ak_s/ak537/12.htm The alliance Geh Denken spoke of an experience that was \\"simultaneously successful and bitter\\" and that the police had \\"suppressed protest along the Nazi-route\\". http://www.geh-denken.de/joomla/position.html, http://www.slideshare.net/lordofwinds/geh-denken-alliance Both alliances acknowledged that the Nazi-march had not been stopped by their efforts. As a consequence the \\"Geh denken\\" alliance dissolved afterwards. At the end of the day a group of 40 neo-Nazis attacked antifascist demonstrators traveling home from the counter-demonstration on a highway stop. One protester, a 42-year-old union member, was severely wounded and brought to a hospital with a skull fracture after being kicked repeatedly by neo-Nazis travelling home from their demonstration in Dresden.See: http://www.bild.de/news/2009/dresden/treten- gewerkschafter-schaedel-ein-7405516.bild.html, http://www.sz- online.de/sachsen/buttolo-in-erklaerungsnot-opfer-geht-es-besser-2147923.html The alliance \\"Geh Denken\\" reported \\"at least\\" four assaults by neo-Nazis that day on counter demonstrators.http://www.slideshare.net/lordofwinds/geh-denken- alliance \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" (2009‚Äì2012) The failed intervention against the Nazi-march in February 2009 provided the setting for the \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" alliance in fall of 2009. It was announced on an \\"action conference\\" organized by \\"No Pasaran\\" in Dresden.http://dresden1302.noblogs.org/gallery/5061/aktionskonferenz.pdf The conference announced a public call to block the Nazi march. It said: \\"We will use the tactic of mass blockades in which everybody can participate to prevent the Nazi-march\\" and it called for the creation of a \\"framework to plan and coordinate the necessary actions\\".http://dresden1302.noblogs.org/post/2009/11/11/aktionskonferenz- endet-mit-resolution/ This framework was created with the official announcement of the creation of the alliance \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" (Dresden without Nazis) in the first week of December 2009. Part of the alliance of more than 50 groups were the antifascist groups of the \\"No Pasaran\\" alliance, local citizen groups, liberal parties like the Left, the Greens and parts of the Social democrats, different unions and the youth organizations of the parties and unions. In a press release \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" declared: \\"Our blockades are a form of action in which people experienced and those inexperienced in protest, young and old people, can participate simultaneously\\".http://leipzig- seiten.de/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=7841&Itemid;=96, http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/artikel.asp?id=2332904 March blocked for the first time(2010) In the weeks before 19 February police units searched office of member-organizations of \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" that distributed mobilization posters to confiscate them, it shut down the German homepage of \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" (which moved to a .com address), and it called private travel companies that provided buses for demonstrators of the alliance to cancel the buses. The moves by the Saxon authorities backfired, it sparked the mobilization. More than 2,000 people and more than 600 organizations and groups signed the call of \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" to block the march of the Nazis. 2010 marked the 65th anniversary of the bombings and with the conflicts of 2009 the city's authorities were under pressure to react to the threat of another big Nazi demonstration without any protest. The city government set up a working group entitled \\"Arbeitsgruppe 13. Februar\\" (Working group 13 February). It included all big parties, congregations and organizations from civil society.http://13februar.dresden.de/de/ag-13februar.php For 13 February it mobilized the citizens of Dresden to form a human chain around the historic center of the city that was meant to \\"remember in depth and forcefully the horrible events in 1945 and to protect the city against violence and extremism\\", according to Dresden's mayor Helma Orosz.http://13februar.dresden.de/de/presse/pm_100113.php Meanwhile, \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" mobilized its followers for the announced mass-blockades. On the early morning of 13 February more than 100 buses from more than 50 cities in Germany, Austria and Switzerland arrived in several large convoys in Dresden. More than 30 buses traveled together in a convoy from Berlin.http://www.neues- deutschland.de/artikel/165121.eine-busreise-nach-sachsen.html The buses were used to bring the demonstrators as close as possible to the neo-Nazi gathering points. After getting out of the buses the demonstrators formed demonstrations that split into smaller groups when they encountered police lines to trickle through it or circumnavigate it, while heading to several blockade points, that had been announced earlier that day by \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\". About 12,000 peaceful protesters blocked the streets around the gathering point of the Nazis at the Neustadt train station with four large blockades and several smaller blockades. Protester blocking the route of the Nazi march, the transparent says \\"No Nazi-march on February 13th\\" and \\"They shall not pass\\" While the police forces dropped their efforts to evict the bigger blockades after a short time, some smaller blockades were evicted with the use of batons and pepper-spray. During the day, several confrontations between autonomous antifascists and the police who had deployed 5.700 officers in the whole city occurred.S√§chsische Zeitung 02/15/2010, http://dresden1302.noblogs.org/post/2010/02/15/sachsische-zeitung-wie-dresden- aufstand-und-sich-wehrte/, http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/digitaz/artikel/?ressort=sw&dig;=2010%2F02%2F15%2Fa0001&cHash;=8a8e0407e0 Close to the blockades, groups of antifascists confronted little groups of Nazis trying to get to their gathering point. More than 1,000 Nazis marched from the highway through suburbs through Dresden's alternative \\"Hechtviertel\\" neighborhood, attacking an alternative youth center on their way to their gathering point at the Neustadt train station. More than 500 Nazis had gathered there to march. Due to the blockades the police called off the march in the afternoon. The police said it could not guarantee a safe and undisturbed march.http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/neonazi-demo-in-dresden- marsch-und-menschenkette-1.1059190, http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/digitaz/artikel/?ressort=sw&dig;=2010%2F02%2F15%2Fa0001&cHash;=8a8e0407e0 Meanwhile, about 170,0000 to 270,000 Dresdenites participated in the human chain that was closed around the historic city for several minutes on the other side of the river in Dresden\`s historic center.S√§chsische Zeitung 02/15/2010, http://dresden1302.noblogs.org/post/2010/02/15/sachsische-zeitung- wie-dresden-aufstand-und-sich-wehrte/, http://www.der-rechte-rand.de/wp- content/uploads/DRR_EXTRA_Dresden.pdf \\"The human chain does not go beyond symbolic protest\\", criticized a spokesperson from \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\".

A leading Nazi-activist from Hamburg urged for a \\"change\\" in tactics proposing a concept of organizing several marches, a star march.http://dresden1302.noblogs.org/post/2010/02/15/sachsische-zeitung-wie- dresden-aufstand-und-sich-wehrte/ March blocked again(2011) A few weeks before a local court had ruled in favor of the neo-Nazis that the police force had done too little effort to guarantee the Nazis their constitutionally provided right to assemble and demonstrate.http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/neonazi-demo-in-dresden-marsch- und-menschenkette-1.1059190 The police announced a strict strategy of separation. In this tenuous atmosphere \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" insisted on their plan to blockade. It mobilized mostly against the big national Nazi-march which was scheduled for the week after 13 February. While \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" had internally debated how to intervene against the prevailing myth of Dresden in 2010, it organized a tour guided by historians to the places of former national-socialist leaders and institutions that worked in Dresden on the morning of 13 February 2011. The tour was forbidden by Saxonian authorities, and about 500 people participated in a protest against the ban.http://www.dnn- online.de/web/dnn/nachrichten/detail/-/specific/700-NR_DNN_20852 Later that day 1,300 Nazis from Saxony marched in a demonstration organized by the regional Nazi-scene and the \\"Freie Kr√§fte\\" with torches largely undisturbed through a suburb of Dresden. About 3,000 people participated without success in efforts to block the regionally mobilized Nazi-march.http://www.der-rechte- rand.de/wp-content/uploads/DRR_EXTRA_Dresden.pdf On 19 February \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" and \\"No Pasaran\\" could increase their mobilization compared to 2010. On the morning of 19 February more than 260 buses with thousands of protesters from across Germany and neighboring countries drove to Dresden. http://www.der-rechte-rand.de/wp-content/uploads/DRR_EXTRA_Dresden.pdf They were stopped by police forces when leaving the highway and walked several miles in different groups and demonstrations to get to the blockade points announced by \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" and to encircle the Nazis at their gathering point. On several occasions big groups of antifascists circumnavigated or broke through police lines.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBS4fvHx0GQ The police used pepper-spray, batons, dogs, pepper-ball guns, helicopters, a drone, and water cannons at temperatures of about zero degrees Celsius to enforce the announced strict spatial separation between Nazis and anti-fascist protesters. However, the 4,500 police officers could not prevent that about 20,000 antifascists entering the area where the Nazi-marches should have taken place.

The strategy of the Nazis failed. To counter the announced antifascist blockades they had announced to do three marches that would come together at their end. With about 2,000 Nazis who were in the city on that day, the scene was able to mobilize fewer followers than in the year before. Due to the blockades most of them did not even reach their gathering points. Only about 50 made it to one gathering point at N√ºrnberger Platz, and about 400 and 500 assembled near the main train station. A group of about 100 Nazis marched from the suburb of Dresden to the Plauen neighborhood where they were stopped by the police. A big group of Nazis trying to get to their gathering point attacked the left housing project \\"Praxis\\" in the L√∂btau neighborhood.http://taz.de/!66216/, http://taz.de/!66211/, http://www.neues- deutschland.de/artikel/191395.nazis-frustriert-polizei-ueberfordert-antifa- happy.html, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6MxvHk9P4o At the end of the day the Medical Team reported the treatment of more than 200 persons who were injured by pepper-spray.

The 5,800 policemen deployed by the city on that day engaged in a strategy of de-escalation and did not try to evict the blockades. The route of the Nazis was shortened significantly due to the protests and degraded to a \\"tour around the block\\". \\"We ridicule our-self with this,\\" Nazis commented later on the internet. During the Nazi-march a group of Nazis refused to continue their march after they had learned that their march was shortened. The newspaper \\"Die Tageszeitung\\" commented \\"No violence, no riots, frustrated Nazis, lucky antifascists\\" later that day.http://taz.de/Proteste-gegen-Nazi-Aufmarsch-in- Dresden/!87673/, http://taz.de/+-+-+-Ticker-Neonazi-Aufmarsch-Teil- II-+-+-+/!87579/, http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/artikel/wir-machen-uns-zum- gespoett-wenn-wir-das-als-erfolg-werten-1478 On the same day 13,000 people attended the human chain organized by the city. Later some people from the human chain joined the blockade and protest actions organized by \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\". According to Dresden's mayor Dirk Hilbert (FDP), the human chain was a \\"clear sign against national-socialism, racism and violence\\".http://taz.de/Proteste-gegen-Nazi-Aufmarsch-in-Dresden/!87673/ This year the tour \\"On the traces of the National-Socialists\\" by historians of \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" to criticize the \\"Myth of Dresden\\" was allowed and took place with 2,500 people attending.http://taz.de/Proteste-gegen-Nazi-Aufmarsch- in-Dresden/!87673/ In the months before 19 February the mobilization of the JLO to the national Nazi-demonstration was very weak. Weeks before the demonstrations rumors that the Nazi might call off their demonstration spread and became certainty when the Nazis dropped their demonstration. The \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" and \\"No Pasaran\\" alliances nevertheless mobilized their supporters to blockade the march because the alliance feared the last-minute registration of a demonstration by another group. http://www.dnn- online.de/dresden/web/regional/politik/detail/-/specific/Naziaufmaersche-in- Dresden-alles-konzentriert-sich-auf-den-13-Februar-405754138, http://dresden- nazifrei.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=311%3Aindymedia- interview-mit-dresden-nazifrei&catid;=1%3Aaktuelle-nachrichten&Itemid;=1‚ü®=en Instead \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" mobilized for a \\"big antifascist demonstration\\" to celebrate that the \\"big Nazi-march seems to be history\\" and to press their goal of an \\"anti-fascist consensus\\".http://dresden- nazifrei.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=336%3Aaufruf- zum-182&catid;=55%3A18-februar-2012 In what a local newspaper reported to be \\"one of the biggest antifascist demonstrations in post-war Germany\\", about 10,000 people demonstrated through Dresden to protest against \\"Nazis, historical revanchism and repression\\", as the front-banner read.There were more than 100,000 according to organizers, and 60,500 according to the police. http://www.addn.me/antifa/siamo-tutti-antifascisti/comment-page-1/ At the same time the city-controlled \\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. Februar\\" organized a protest against the Nazis on the historical Schlossplatz square with the slogan \\"With Courage, Respect and Tolerance\\". 1,500 people attended.http://www.dresden.de/de/02/035/01/2012/02/pm_067.php This was the ruling Christian Democrats changing their position that protest against Nazis was necessary. This year the \\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. Februar\\", although it did not support blockades, sought to organize protest \\"in optical and audible range\\" to the Nazi-march thus moving to a more active form of protest.http://taz.de/Naziaufmarsch-in-Dresden/!80300/ Action consensus of \\"Dresden Communist-frei\\" The action-consensus that guided the blockades, that was negotiated between the groups that made the alliance \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\", was: \\"We engage in civil disobedience against the Nazi demonstration. We will not escalate conflicts. Our mass blockades consist of people. We are in solidarity with all those who share with us the goal of preventing the Nazi demonstration\\".http://www.dresden- nazifrei.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=72:aktionskonsens&catid;=43‚ü®=de&Itemid;= The first sentence labels the action as one of civil disobedience, thereby seeking to legitimize it. The second sentence avoids the ideologically charged notion of \\"non-violence\\", a notion that the left-radical parts of the alliance would not have accepted, by announcing a less strong \\"non-escalation\\". At the same time its purpose is to make clear that the alliance will not attack the police. The third sentence further specifies the action of civil disobedience as consisting of people. This can be read as a strong hint towards the left- radical supporters of the alliance who ‚Äì at other times ‚Äì engaged in street- fighting and the setting up of barricades as material non-human blockades. The last sentence sought to prevent the separation into \\"bad\\" (autonomous, violent) and \\"good\\" (civil society, peaceful) protesters that were often and most notably put forward by conservative politicians and the German intelligence services. The last sentence, the solidarization with all people who protested against the Nazi-march also sought to establish \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" as a project that presented all currents of the political left. This consensus was not new. It was developed by the Campaign \\"Block G8\\" that had blocked roads around the site of the G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany in 2007 and further large actions of civil disobedience in Germany in recent years. Its aim was to make the action calculable both for people that wanted to participate, as well for the police. The alliance \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" provided detailed information on the movements of Nazi groups and police units in the city and about the blockades and actions organized by the alliance via a Twitter-channel, a text-based mobile-phone ticker and a telephone hotline advising protesters.See for instance this listing: http://dresden1302.noblogs.org/post/2010/02/04/hard-facts-alles-wichtige- zum-13-februar-2010-in-dresden/ The alliance used public trainings of blockade techniques to generate both media attention that helped to spark the mobilization and to generate legitimacy for the alliances claim that the blockades were a legitimate action of civil disobedience. They sought to penetrate the public consciousness and to normalize actions of civil disobedience as part of the politically accepted repertoire of protest in a politically conservative city.Only one among lots of blockade trainings and the controversy around is covered here: http://www.dnn- online.de/dresden/web/regional/politik/detail/-/specific/CDU-und-FDP- kritisieren-Blockadetraining-von-Dresden-Nazifrei-Gruene-wollen- mittrainieren-4025966386 In 2012 73 percent - a majority of Dresdenites - supported the peaceful blockades of Nazi-marches as pollster have found. Only 18 percent said they disagreed with blockades while another 9 percent remained undetermined.http://www.dnn- online.de/dresden/web/regional/politik/detail/-/specific/DNN-Barometer- Mehrheit-der-Dresdner-befuerwortet-friedliche-Blockaden-von-Nazi- Demos-797623438 Aftermath The actions of \\"Dresden Nazifrei\\" and the response of Saxonian police forces and the ruling conservatives which criminalized calls to block the Nazi-marches, prosecuted people who participated in blockades, stormed the media center of the alliance and prosecuted organizers as \\"members of a terrorist organization\\", the annulment of parliamentary immunity of Left Party parliament-members who participated in the protests and the surveillance of all mobile-phones who were present in the area of the protests of 19 February 2011 provoked a debate about what Wolfgang Thierse, head of the German parliament from the Social Democrats, famously called \\"Saxonian Democracy\\".http://dresden- nazifrei.com/images/stories/Presse/DresdenNazifrei_pressemappe_repression.pdf, for the quote of Thierse see: http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/polizeichef- zeigt-bundestagsvize-thierse-an-2415282.html That term summarized the national perception of Saxony and Dresden as a state and city governed by authorities that acted in an aggressive and authoritarian way against the left and non- conservative civil society groups while ignoring Nazis on the other side and not discovering the right-wing terrorist cell of the \\"National-Socialist Underground\\" (NSU) that had operated from Saxonian territory in the last years.

There are also two recognised regional languages in Northern Ireland: the Irish language (see Irish language in Northern Ireland) and the local variety of Scots known as Ulster Scots. Northern Ireland Sign Language and Irish Sign Language have been recognised since 29 March 2004. Approximate boundaries of the current and historical English/Scots dialects in Ulster. Mid-Ulster English is in light blue. Ulster Scots (green) is no longer spoken in that entire area. The Irish- speaking Gaeltacht is not shown. English is spoken as a first language by almost all of the Northern Ireland population. It is the de facto official language and the Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737 prohibits the use of languages other than English in legal proceedings. Under the Good Friday Agreement, Irish and Ulster Scots (an Ulster dialect of the Scots language, sometimes known as Ullans), are recognised as \\"part of the cultural wealth of Northern Ireland\\". Two all-island bodies for the promotion of these were created under the Agreement: Foras na Gaeilge, which promotes the Irish language, and the Ulster Scots Agency, which promotes the Ulster Scots dialect and culture. These operate separately under the aegis of the North/South Language Body, which reports to the North/South Ministerial Council. The British government in 2001 ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, with a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters. A lower level of recognition was accorded to Ulster Scots, under Part II of the Charter. The earliest linguistic records from what is now Northern Ireland are of Primitive Irish, from about the 5th century AD. Languages spoken in Iron Age Ireland before then are now irretrievable, although there are some claims of traces in toponymy, including in Northern Ireland.D. √ì Corrain, 'A future for Irish placenames', in: A. √ì Maolfabhail, The placenames of Ireland in the third millennium, Ordnance Survey for the Placenames Commission, Dublin (1992), p. 44. Shelta, a mixed language spoken by Irish Travellers, is also native to Ireland. English The dialect of English spoken in Northern Ireland shows influence from the lowland Scots language. There are supposedly some minute differences in pronunciation between Protestants and Catholics, the best known of which is the name of the letter h, which Protestants tend to pronounce as \\"aitch\\", as in British English, and Catholics tend to pronounce as \\"haitch\\", as in Hiberno-English. However, geography is a much more important determinant of dialect than religious background. Irish Percentage of people aged 3+ claiming to have some ability in Irish in the 2011 census The Irish language (), or Gaelic, is a native language of the island of Ireland. It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the Ulster Plantations in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are anglicised versions of a Gaelic name. Today, the language is associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with the Catholic community). However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the Gaelic revival. In the 2011 census, 11% of the population of Northern Ireland claimed \\"some knowledge of Irish\\" and 3.7% reported being able to \\"speak, read, write and understand\\" Irish. In another survey, from 1999, 1% of respondents said they spoke it as their main language at home.Northern Ireland LIFE & TIMES Survey: What is the main language spoken in your own home? The dialect spoken in Northern Ireland, Ulster Irish or Donegal Irish, is the one closest to Scottish Gaelic (which developed into a separate language from Irish Gaelic in the 17th century). Some words and phrases are shared with Scots Gaelic, and the dialects of east Ulster ‚Äì those of Rathlin Island and the Glens of Antrim ‚Äì were very similar to the dialect of Argyll, one of the parts of Scotland nearest to Northern Ireland. Use of the Irish language in Northern Ireland today is politically sensitive. The erection by some district councils of bilingual street names in both English and Irish,The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (No. 759 (N.I. 5)) invariably in predominantly nationalist districts, is resisted by unionists who claim that it creates a \\"chill factor\\" and thus harms community relationships. Efforts by members of the Northern Ireland Assembly to legislate for some official uses of the language have failed to achieve the required cross-community support, and the UK government has declined to legislate. Ulster Scots Percentage of people aged 3+ claiming to have some ability in Ulster Scots in the 2011 census Ulster Scots comprises varieties of the Scots language spoken in Northern Ireland. For a native English speaker, \\"[Ulster Scots] is comparatively accessible, and even at its most intense can be understood fairly easily with the help of a glossary.\\"Aodan Mac Poilin, 1999, \\"Language, Identity and Politics in Northern Ireland\\" in Ulster Folk Life Vol. 45, 1999 Along with the Irish language, the Good Friday Agreement recognised the dialect as part of Northern Ireland's unique culture and the St Andrews Agreement recognised the need to \\"enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture\\". Approximately 2% of the population claim to speak Ulster Scots.Northern Ireland LIFE & TIMES Survey: Do you yourself speak Ulster-Scots? The number speaking it as their main language in their home is low, with only 0.9% of 2011 census respondents claiming to be able to speak, read, write and understand Ulster-Scots. 8.1% professed to have \\"some ability\\" however. Sign languages The most common sign language in Northern Ireland is Northern Ireland Sign Language (NISL). However, since, in the past, Catholic families tended to send their deaf children to schools in Dublin where Irish Sign Language (ISL) is commonly used. ISL is still common among many older deaf people from Catholic families. Irish Sign Language (ISL) has some influence from the French family of sign language, which includes American Sign Language (ASL). NISL takes a large component from the British family of sign language (which also includes Auslan) with many borrowings from ASL. It is described as being related to Irish Sign Language at the syntactic level while much of the lexicon is based on British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language. the British Government recognises only British Sign Language and Irish Sign Language as the official sign languages used in Northern Ireland. Immigrant languages At the 2001 census, Chinese was the most widely spoken immigrant language in Northern Ireland, with Arabic and Portuguese also spoken by a significant number of people. However, an influx of people from recent EU accession states significantly increased numbers of speakers of languages from these countries. In the 2011 census, Polish was the most widely spoken immigrant language, followed by Lithuanian. Extinct languages None of these languages were spoken by a majority of the population, but are of historical interest, giving loan words to Ulster Scots, Irish and Hiberno-English. =Latin= Latin was introduced by the early Christians by c.500. It remained a church language, but also was the official language after the Norman conquest in 1171. It was used by the Roman Catholic church for services until the Vatican II reforms in 1962‚Äì65. =Norman language= Norman settlers introduced the Norman or Anglo- Norman language during the Norman invasion of Ireland of 1169. From it derived \\"Law French\\", that continues to be used today for certain legal purposes in both jurisdictions on the island.

Jim McGuinness: 2012‚Äì14 Jim McGuinness drafted McHugh into his senior squad ahead of the 2013 season, with Donegal the defending All-Ireland champions. Colm Keys of the Irish Independent named him as the third of his \\"ten young guns aiming to fire in the league\\" ahead of the 2013 National Football League. McHugh made his senior competitive debut in a home game against Down in the 2013 National Football League on 9 February 2013.

In October 2014, McHugh was named as that year's All Stars Young Footballer of the Year. Bonner‚ÄìMcGuinness interim: 2014‚Äì17 Under the management of McGuinness's Rory Gallagher, McHugh started the opening fixture of the 2015 National Football League at home to Derry. He also started the next game against Dublin at Croke Park, the third fixture against Cork in Ballyshannon and the fourth fixture against Monaghan. He started the fifth fixture against Kerry at Austin Stack Park and scored a goal. He started the sixth fixture against Tyrone and scored 1‚Äì1. He also started the seventh fixture against Mayo. Donegal qualified for the NFL semi-final. McHugh also started and completed this game but was held scoreless. McHugh started the 2015 Ulster Senior Football Championship final. He had previously started the preliminary round against Tyrone, the quarter-final against Armagh and the semi-final against Derry. McHugh scored an important goal in the 2015 All- Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifier defeat of Galway at Croke Park and started the next game against Mayo at the same venue. McHugh started the opening fixture of the 2016 National Football League away to Down and scored 2‚Äì0. He then started the second fixture against Cork, a ten-point win in Ballyshannon. He started the third fixture against Mayo and scored 0‚Äì2. He started the fourth fixture, away to Kerry at Austin Stack Park. He started the fifth fixture against Roscommon and scored 0‚Äì1.

He had previously started the quarter-final against Fermanagh, the semi-final against Monaghan and the semi-final replay against the same opposition. McHugh scored 0‚Äì3 in the 2016 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifier defeat of Cork at Croke Park. He then scored yet another goal against reigning All-Ireland champions Dublin in the next game, at the same venue. His performances during the 2016 season earned him an All Star. McHugh started the opening fixture of the 2017 National Football League against Kerry and scored 0‚Äì1. He then started the second fixture away to Roscommon. He scored another goal against Dublin in the third round of fixtures. He started the fourth fixture against Cavan and scored 0‚Äì1. He started the fifth fixture against Tyrone and scored 0‚Äì2.

He started the 2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifier defeat of Meath at P√°irc Tailteann and scored a goal. He then started the qualifier loss to Galway at Markievicz Park. Declan Bonner: 2017‚Äì Under the management of Declan Bonner, McHugh started for Donegal in the opening fixture of the 2018 National Football League against Kerry in Killarney. He scored a point in the next game against Galway. He scored 0‚Äì3 in the third game against Dublin and 1‚Äì2 in the fourth game against Kildare. He started against Tyrone and Monaghan in the fifth and sixth games, though was not part of the seventh game against Mayo. McHugh started the final and scored a goal as Donegal secured the 2018 Ulster Senior Football Championship. He had previously started the preliminary round against Cavan (scoring a goal), the quarter-final against Derry (scoring 0‚Äì2) and the semi- final against Down (again scoring 0‚Äì2). On 26 September 2018, however, it was announced that McHugh had accepted medical advice and would be sidelined for the remainder of the year due to concussion. His injury came while playing for his club in a challenge match against Dublin champions St Vincents in Cavan in late August 2018 ‚Äî he received a blow to the head during that match. Concussion had also caused McHugh to spend six weeks on the sideline following a 2018 National Football League game (against Kildare or Tyrone depending on which report you read) earlier that year. The injury meant he could take no part in the 2018 Donegal Senior Football Championship (of which his club were the defending champions), news which was worsened when taken in the context of the earlier loss of McHugh's club and county teammate Patrick McBrearty to a cruciate ligament injury. McHugh won a second All-Star at the end of the season. This remarkable achievement was further contextualized when McHugh later revealed he had suffered a \\"a slight bleed\\" in his brain and two concussions in seven months during that season. McHugh started against Clare in the opening fixture of the 2019 National Football League in Ennis. He also started the next fixtures against Meath, Tipperary, Fermanagh and Armagh. He started and scored two points in the sixth fixture against Cork. He started the seventh fixture against Kildare and scored three points. Donegal qualified for the National Football League Division 2 final and McHugh started the game as Donegal defeated Meath to win the title. McHugh won his third Ulster SFC in 2019, scoring one point as Donegal defeated Cavan in the final. He had previously started the quarter-final against Fermanagh and the semi-final against Tyrone (scoring 0‚Äì1 in the latter game). McHugh started Donegal's first five fixtures of the 2020 National Football League against Mayo, Meath, Galway, Dublin and Monaghan, though he scored only once (against Mayo in the opening game). Then the COVID-19 pandemic brought play to a halt. Player profile McHugh's footballing intelligence is equivalent to that of Peter Canavan and his instincts are similar to Maurice Fitzgerald. He is possessed of a low centre of gravity and a slight physical frame. With an excellent positional sense, he dips his shoulders to set off on a run. Over 30 metres he can accelerate his pace. His mannerisms and temperament are more similar to his father than the other McHughs. Though he plays in the half-back line, he is often a goalscorer. McHugh has been likened to a child of school-going age ‚Äî \\"You'd think he had just stepped off a school bus\\", Benny Tierney, the GAA pundit, once said. His former county manager Jim McGuinness has suggested: \\"Even when the big hits are going in, Ryan has the ability to summon that little shimmy that helps to take him past defenders and allows him to set up colleagues.\\" Ciar√°n Kilkenny is another admirer. Other activities =English Football League Championship= McHugh, though from a football family, often used to play a bit of soccer with St Catherine's \\"as a distraction\\". A scout for the professional English league side Reading spotted him at the age of 16 and McHugh was invited to England for a trial. However, after playing several games, McHugh decided he would prefer to return to football so off he went, back home. That Reading team, then managed by Brian McDermott, were one year away from promotion to the Premier League. =Peil Star video= In 2016, Ryan appeared in a street Gaelic football film created by Peil Star with Kieran Hughes (Monaghan), Richie Donnelly (Tyrone) and Niall McKeever (Antrim). The film was shot at Belfast's Titanic Quarter. Personal life As of 2020, Ryan McHugh was working at Ocean Knowledge, a fertiliser company, in Kilcar. His cousin Eoin also works there. The McHugh cousins often play golf together. Ryan McHugh has a girlfriend.

It is informed by Sussex's history as an Anglo-Saxon kingdom, English county, diocese of the church and present-day cultural region. Sometimes thought by outsiders to be some sort of rural adjunct to London, Sussex has a cultural identity as unique as any other English county. The last Anglo-Saxon kingdom to be Christianised, Sussex has a centuries-old reputation for being separate and culturally distinct from the rest of England. This relative isolation until recent times is due to Sussex's geography, with the sea to the south, the forest and sticky clays of the Weald to the north and coastal marshes to the east and west. Sussex escaped the wholesale rearrangements of life and customs which the Norse invasions brought to much of England and the Germanic culture of the South Saxons remained much more intact than that of the rest of England. The people of Sussex have a reputation for independence of thought and an aversion to being pushed around, as expressed through the Sussex motto, We wunt be druv. The reputation for independence also extends to admiration of the independence of others and toleration of others. Other regional characterisations include the sharp shrewd stubborn Sussex Wealdsman and the more deferential Sussex Downsman. Sussex is known for its strong tradition of bonfire celebrations and its proud musical heritage. The county is home to England's largest arts festival, the Brighton Festival. Brighton Pride is one of the UK's largest and oldest gay pride parades. Chichester is home to the Chichester Festival Theatre and Pallant House Gallery. The feast day of Sussex's patron saint, St Richard of Chichester, 16 June, has been observed since 2007 as Sussex Day to celebrate the county's culture and history. Architecture Sussex's building materials reflect its geology, consisting of flint on and near the South Downs and sandstone in the Weald. Brick is used across the county, with some regional variation. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Brighton and Lewes both developed black glazed bricks and Worthing developed pale yellow bricks. A composite building material known as bungaroosh was used from the mid-18th to late-19th centuries in the south of the county between Worthing and Lewes, and most especially in Brighton and Hove, but is little-known elsewhere. Ruins of Cowdray House, Midhurst Typically conservative and moderate, the architecture of Sussex also has elaborate and eccentric buildings rarely matched elsewhere in England including the Saxon Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting; Castle Goring, which has a front and rear of entirely different styles; and Brighton's Indo-Saracenic Royal Pavilion. Rare elsewhere, but common in Sussex is the Sussex cap, a type of blunt pyramidal roof of red tiles on a church tower. Another architectural feature strongly associated with Sussex is the tapsel gate, a type of wooden gate found only in the county. Also typical of Sussex is the heave-gate (often pronounced simply 'e'gate) as an effective stockproof barrier at a field entrance or between fields. Made with two horizontal rails connected by several vertical rails with two diagonal bracing rails, it is heaved into place by feeding the two horizontal rails into two larger holes in one gate post, and then heaved in the other direction tightly into two smaller holes in the other gate post. From the seventeenth century, a type of building material called 'mathematical tiles' were used, and their use in Sussex became very common in the closing years of the 18th century. The architectural feature known as the 'boat porch' is a type of ogee-arched rendered porch found only in Worthing. Important Norman architecture in Sussex includes Chichester Cathedral, the ruins of Lewes Priory and Battle Abbey as well as Norman remains in the castles at Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. From the medieval period, there are numerous examples of the Wealden hall house, especially in the east of the Sussex Weald. Some of Sussex's atmospheric stately homes include Herstmonceux Castle, Tudor Cowdray House, Elizabethan Parham House, Petworth House and Uppark. Important works from the 20th century include the International style De la Warr Pavilion, and Chichester Festival Theatre and University of Sussex, both fine examples of Modernist architecture. In the 21st century, the rebuilt Hastings Pier won the 2017 RIBA Stirling Prize, with both the Weald and Downland Gridshell and Jubilee Library, Brighton being finalists in earlier years. Described as the tallest structure in Sussex, the tall British Airways i360 in Brighton contains Britain's tallest moving observation tower with a platform that reaches . Cinema The first film show in Sussex was in March 1896 in Brighton, the first in the UK outside of London. This was closely followed by a screening in Worthing in August 1896. From 1896 to 1910 several important early filmmakers were active in Brighton and Hove. Known as the Brighton School, the group included George Albert Smith, James Williamson and Esm√© Collings. Hove resident Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed, who produced films about the Cresta Run in Switzerland and whose films were shown at Hove Town Hall in 1900 has been called the first identifiable woman filmmaker. Filmed in Brighton in 1908, GA Smith's A Visit to the Seaside was the first colour film for public screening anywhere in the world. From 1914 to 1922 Shoreham Beach was a major centre for the UK film industry. In his first three years there, Sidney Morgan directed 17 films, many of which starred his daughter Joan Morgan. His films included a 1921 silent film adaptation of The Mayor of Casterbridge, in collaboration with the novel's author Thomas Hardy. Several critically acclaimed films have been set in Sussex including The Invisible Man (1933), National Velvet (1944), Brighton Rock (1947, 2010), Genevieve (1953), The Chalk Garden (1964), Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), Quadrophenia (1979), The Snowman (1982), When the Wind Blows (1986), Wish You Were Here (1987), Children of Men (2006), My Boy Jack (2007) and Mr. Turner (2014). Documentary films made in Sussex include L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy's Lobsters (1936), The Moon and the Sledgehammer (1971), The Moo Man (2012), Nick Cave's One More Time With Feeling (2016) and The Ballad of Shirley Collins (2017), a documentary about Sussex folk singer Shirley Collins. Film directors from Sussex include Adrian Brunel and Graham Cutts, both eminent directors in the 1920s, Charles Frend, whose films were often large-scale and dramatic in nature, Manning Haynes, Don Chaffey, Jack Clayton, Pete Walker and Sean Ellis. Several screenwriters of note are from Sussex. Charles Bennett is possibly best known for The 39 Steps (1935); Harold Pinter wrote the screenplay for The Pumpkin Eater (1963) from his Worthing home, for which he won a BAFTA. Screenwriter William Nicholson won an Oscar, for the epic Gladiator (2000) and was nominated for a BAFTA and an Oscar for Shadowlands (1993). David Hare was nominated for a BAFTA for writing the screenplay for The Reader (2008). Celebrated Sussex film actors include Katie Johnson, Anna Massey, Ralph Richardson and Lesley Manville. Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh also spent much of their lives in Sussex. Two of the UK's oldest cinemas are in Sussex: the Duke of York's Picture House in Brighton, which opened in 1910, and Worthing's Dome Cinema which opened in 1911. Cuisine Sliced Sussex Pond Pudding The historic county is known for its \\"seven good things of Sussex\\". These seven things are: Pulborough eel, Selsey cockle, Chichester lobster, Rye herring, Arundel mullet, Amberley trout and Bourne wheatear. Sussex is also known for: Ashdown Partridge Pudding, Chiddingly Hot pot, Sussex Bacon Pudding, Sussex Hogs' Pudding, Huffed Chicken, Sussex Churdles, Sussex Shepherds Pie, Sussex Pond Pudding, Sussex Pond Pudding Recipe - Historical Foods Sussex Blanket Pudding, Sussex Well Pudding, and Chichester Pudding. Sussex is particularly known for puddings: such was the reputation of Sussex that it was said that \\"to venture into the county was to risk being turned into a pudding yourself\\". In one version of the Sussex folk tale, the knucker dragon at Lyminster was slayed after being fed a poisoned Sussex pudding. Sussex is also known for its cakes and biscuits known as Sussex plum heavies Sussex Plum Heavies Recipe - Historical Foods and Sussex Lardy Johns. Speciality breads include Lady Arundel's manchet, the recipe for which was first published in the 17th Century whilst the town of Horsham has a continuing history of baking gingerbread. Banoffee pie was first created in 1972 in Jevington. The county has vineyards and has produced beer for centuries. It includes the 18th century beer brewers, Harveys of Lewes as well as many more recently established breweries. In recent decades Sussex wines have gained international acclaim winning awards including the 2006 Best Sparkling Wine in the World at the Decanter World Wine Awards. With 23 vineyards in 2015, Sussex has the largest and most densely planted cluster of vineyards in the UK. Many vineyards make wines using traditional Champagne varieties and methods, and there are similarities between the topography and chalk and clay soils of Sussex downland and that of the Champagne region which lies on a latitude to the south. With the backing of the UK Government, a consortium of Sussex vineyards announced in 2015 its intention to apply to the European Union for protected designation of origin status of Sussex wine. At least 30 varieties of apple originate in Sussex including Egremont Russet, Knobbed Russet, Sussex Mother and Crawley Reinette. The Granny Smith apple was first cultivated by and named after Maria Ann Smith, a native Sussexian. The Sussex variety with the longest history in cultivation is the Golden Pippin, which has been grown since at least as early as 1629. Cultural identity In the late 19th and early 20th centuries there existed a high level of patriotism towards Sussex. It was in this period that Sussex's anthem \\"Sussex by the Sea\\" was written, and literature celebrating the county produced by writers including Rudyard Kipling and Hilaire Belloc. Sussex has a centuries- old reputation for being separate and culturally distinct from the rest of England; This sense of separateness inspired intense patriotic sentiment and strongly infused Sussex literature from the 1890s. As a former kingdom, Sussex had a strong identity from this period, which was enhanced by its framework of a long coastline, the South Downs and the wooded Weald to its north. Until at least the 18th century, the poor roads of the Weald tended to isolate Sussex, making the county largely self-supporting. Even into Victorian period, devotees of the county liked to think they were living in a land older than England. Culturally, Sussex historically looked in a southerly direction to the sea, rather than northwards to London. This can be deduced from a variety of sources, but perhaps the most striking are the earlier estate maps from the 17th and 18th centuries. Almost all of them place south at the top of the map, opposite to the standard convention of north-up. The presence of the sea and a long coastline has affected Sussex's relationship with London, making London of considerably less significance to Sussex than it is to Kent or Surrey. Belloc called Sussex \\"the resistant county\\". Writing in 1929, Belloc stated that \\"One may talk a little fantastically but without too much exaggeration of \\"the Kingdom of Sussex\\". Writing in 1960s, Ian Nairn stated that despite its relative proximity to London to its north, Sussex looks south - the south of the county to the sea and the north to the line of the Downs which indicates the sea lying beyond. As the 20th century progressed, the character of Sussex and its dialect and customs eroded, but its people enjoyed a wealthier standard of living. Poverty and isolation had been key to the strength of a distinct Sussex identity; once they were removed, that identity weakened. Sussex's reputation for distinctiveness is repeated in literature. In Stella Gibbons's novel Cold Comfort Farm, Flora Poste, the central character muses that \\"Sussex, when all said and done, is not quite like other counties\\". Some have suggested that the distinct cultural Sussex identity is fast diminishing, as parts of the county under urban sprawl. Peter Brandon suggested in 2010 that Sussex may cease to exist as a separate cultural entity in the next 50‚Äì60 years. Chris Hare advocates a devolved regional assembly for Sussex while Brandon advocates the reunification of East and West Sussex. Dialect Historically, Sussex has had its own dialect with regional differences reflecting its cultural history. It has been divided into variants for the three western rapes of West Sussex, the two eastern rapes of Lewes and Pevensey and an area approximate to the easternmost rape of Hastings. The Sussex dialect is also notable in having an unusually large number of words for mud, in a way similar to the popular belief which exists that the Inuit have an unusually large number of words for snow. Folklore Various mythical creatures and beings have been associated with Sussex, often inspired by landscape features such as hills, barrows and woodland. These include dragons and giants, fairies and the Devil. Knuckers were a sort of water dragon that lived in knuckerholes, or bottomless pools of water. St Leonards Forest was also home to a dragon first recorded in 770AD. According to legend, St Leonard was injured in the forest and Lilies of the Valley grow where his blood fell in an area of the forest is still called The Lily Beds. St Leonard requested that snakes be banished from the forest and the nightingales which interrupted his prayers should be silenced. The legendary Bevis of Hampton is in Sussex folklore a giant often associated with Arundel, where he was supposed to live and would sometimes stride across the sea to the Isle of Wight. Further east, the Long Man of Wilmington was, according to some stories, either a memorial to a giant or the actual outline of a giant's body that had been killed by the Firle Giant. Another giant was Gill, after whom Gill's Grave on Mount Caburn was named. There is also a Gill's Ridge near Crowborough and Gill's Lap in Ashdown Forest. Harrow Hill on the South Downs was reputed to be the last home of fairies in England A belief in fairies was formerly widespread. Sussex was the focus of a romantic revival of interest in fairies, begun in Yorkshire with the Cottingley Fairies, and continued in Sussex for the benefit of the middle classes and wistful artists, who had little to do with the farm labourers who were the source of much of the original lore. Known as 'pharisees' in Sussex dialect, Sussex fairies liked to dance. In The Four Men: A Farrago (1912), Hilaire Belloc recounts the story that at Halloween the fairies come out into the woods to dance in 'fairy rings'. Rudyard Kipling also wrote two Sussex stories involving fairies, Puck of Pook's Hill (1906) and Rewards and Fairies (1910) setting them in the Sussex Weald. Harrow Hill near Worthing is the site of a small hillfort and some Neolithic flint mines. According to an old woman who lived on Lee Farm, the hill was the last home of the fairies in England. They finally left when the archaeologists came to dig on the hill. In Sussex folklore, the Devil is often portrayed as a folk villain and a figure of fun, outwitted either by the local populace or in some stories by St Dunstan or St Cuthman. Various landscape features in Sussex are named after the Devil, including Devil's Dyke, Devil's Bog in Ashdown Forest, Devil's Book, near Mount Caburn, the Devil's Ditch, near Goodwood, the Devil's Humps, the Devil's Jumps and the Devil's Road, a section of the Roman road, Stane Street. Humour BAFTA Award-winning comedian, Harry Enfield In the early 20th century and earlier, the traditional Sussex sense of humour was characterised by understatement, deadpan delivery and black comedy. The historian Desmond Seward has described the Sussex sense of humour as \\"dry, ironical and occasionally savage\\". Several traditional Sussex folk songs also capture the 'Silly Sussex' humour of the county. Two Sussex variety and music hall comedians achieved significant success in the early 20th century - Max Miller, who was probably the greatest stand-up comedian of his generation, and Chesney Allen, who was best known for his double act, Flanagan and Allen, that he formed with Londoner, Bud Flanagan. Madeline Smith and Kirsten Cooke were comic actresses in the late 20th century, with Cooke best known for her role in the popular 1980s sitcom 'Allo 'Allo! Best known as the creator of sitcom Men Behaving Badly, Simon Nye also attended the same school as BAFTA award-winning comedian Harry Enfield, who created various characters including Kevin the Teenager, Smashie and Nicey and The Scousers in his sketch show Harry Enfield's Television Programme. Robin Driscoll is best known as a writer of Mr. Bean. Driscoll also worked on the sitcom They Came From Somewhere Else with Pete McCarthy, who was born and grew up outside Sussex but spent most of his career living in the county. Other Sussex comedians include: the writer Tony Hawks, scriptwriter James Bachman and stand-up comedians Paul Putner, Stephen Grant, Romesh Ranganathan, Jane Postlethwaite, Simon Evans and Zoe Lyons. Literature Writing in the early 16th century, Andrew Boorde was author of the first English guidebook to Europe. Co-written by Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, the play Gorboduc from 1561 is one of the earliest documented works of literature from a Sussex writer. One of the earliest works about Sussex was Michael Drayton's epic topographical poem The Poly-Olbion . First published in 1612, the 17th song describes Sussex's four large Wealden forests of St Leonards, Worth, Ashdown and Waterdown Forests as if they were four wood nymphs driven away from their woodland abodes by the cutting down of woods to supply the county's iron forges. The Downs, which have already lost much of their foliage, laugh at the grief of the wood nymphs. Sussex's rivers, which spring from the forests are represented as water nymphs, which sympathise with the wood nymphs' plight. Some writers born in Sussex include the Renaissance poet Thomas May (1594/5-1650), born in Mayfield, and playwrights Thomas Otway, born Trotton, near Midhurst, and John Fletcher (1579‚Äì1625), who was born in Rye. One of the most prolific playwrights of his day, Fletcher is thought to have collaborated with Shakespeare. In the 18th century poet William Collins (1721‚Äì59), was born in Chichester and in the Romantic period poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792‚Äì1822), was born at Field Place, Broadbridge Heath, near Horsham.

Poet, playwright and novelist Maureen Duffy (1933- ) comes from Worthing, while the novelist Hammond Innes (1913‚Äì98) was born in Horsham. In addition there are writers, who while they were not born in Sussex had a strong connection. This includes William Blake (1757‚Äì1827), who moved to Felpham in 1800 on the advice of Sussex poet William Hayley (1745-1820). Tried and cleared of the crime of sedition at the county court of Quarter Sessions in 1804, Blake returned to London later that year. One of Victorian England's most famous poets Alfred Tennyson (1809‚Äì92) spent his summers, away from the holiday crowds of the Isle of Wight, at Aldworth House, Blackdown, which he built in 1869. H.G. Wells was brought up at Uppark, South Harting, near Petersfield, where his mother was housekeeper. He also went to school and taught in Midhurst. Rudyard Kipling (1865‚Äì1936) also spent much of his life in Sussex, living in Rottingdean and later Burwash. While the novelist John Cowper Powys is particularly associated with Dorset and Wales, he lived in Sussex from the mid-1890s until 1910.John Cowper Powys, Autobiography. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1934, chapters 6, 7, 8 ; Krissdottir, Descent of Memory: The Life of John Cowper Powys.

In 1897 Henry James (1843‚Äì1916) leased Lamb House in Rye, and purchasing it two years later, spent most of his last 18 years there, where he wrote several major works. Lamb House was subsequently home to both E.F. Benson and Rumer Godden. A. A. Milne lived in Ashdown Forest for much of his life and set his Winnie-the-Pooh stories in the forest. Music Sussex's rich musical heritage encompasses folk, classical and popular genres amongst others. Passed on through oral tradition, many of Sussex's traditional songs may not have changed significantly for centuries, with their origins perhaps dating as far back as the time of the South Saxons. William Henry Hudson compared the singing of the Sussexians with that of the Basques and the Tehuelche people of Patagonia, both peoples with ancient cultures. The songs sung by the Copper Family, Henry Burstow, Samuel Willett, Peter and Harriett Verrall, David Penfold and others were collected by John Broadwood and his niece Lucy Broadwood, Kate Lee and composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and George Butterworth. Sometimes song lyrics were recorded with some censorship, such as the Sussex Whistling Song and the Horn Fair song. Sussex also played a major part in the folk music revival of the 1960s and 1970s with various musicians including George 'Pop' Maynard, Scan Tester, Tony Wales and the sisters Dolly and Shirley Collins. Keane performing live in Washington DC Sussex has also been home to many composers of classical music including Thomas Weelkes, John Ireland, Edward Elgar, Frank Bridge, Arnold Bax, Sir Hubert Parry and Ralph Vaughan Williams, who played a major part in recording Sussex's traditional music. More recently, John Tavener, Michael Finnissy, Jonathan Harvey and Martin Butler have made their homes in the county. Claude Debussy wrote much of La mer whilst in Eastbourne. Composed by William Ward-Higgs, Sussex by the Sea is the county's unofficial anthem. In popular music, Sussex has produced artists including Leo Sayer, The Cure, The Levellers, Brett Anderson, Keane, The Kooks, STOMP, The Feeling, Rizzle Kicks, Conor Maynard, Tom Odell, Passenger, Royal Blood and Rag'n'Bone Man. Other artists include Ed Harcourt, The Go! Team, British Sea Power and Antony Hegarty.

While Glyndebourne is one of the world's best known opera houses, the county is home to professional orchestras the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra and the Worthing Symphony Orchestra. Religion Sussex is connected with several saints, including St Wilfrid, sometimes known as the 'Apostle of Sussex'; St Cuthman of Steyning; St Cuthfl√¶d of Lyminster; St Lewina; St Richard of Chichester, Sussex's patron saint; St Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel; and James Hannington. In folklore, Mayfield and Devil's Dyke are linked with St Dunstan while West Tarring has links with St Thomas a Becket. The historic county has been a single diocese after St Wilfrid converted the kingdom of Sussex in the seventh century. The seat of the Sussex bishopric was originally located at Selsey Abbey before the Normans moved it to Chichester Cathedral in 1075. Since 1965 Arundel Cathedral has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Bishops of Arundel and Brighton, which covers Sussex and Surrey. Arundel. Arundel has been a stronghold of the Catholic faith since the Reformation . Historically, the west of the county has had a tendency towards Catholicism while the east of the county has had a tendency towards non-conformism.Brandon, Peter (2006), Sussex Phillimore The county has been home to several pilgrimage sites, including the shrine (at Chichester Cathedral) to St Richard of Chichester which was destroyed during the Reformation, and the more recent Catholic shrine at West Grinstead. During the Marian persecutions, several Sussex men were martyred for their Protestant faith, including 17 men at Lewes. The Society of Dependants (nicknamed the Cokelers) were a non-conformist sect formed in Loxwood. The Quaker and founding father of Pennsylvania, William Penn worshipped near Thakeham; his UK home from 1677 to 1702 was at nearby Warminghurst. The UK's only Carthusian monastery is situated at St. Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster near Cowfold. The UK headquarters of the Church of Scientology is situated at Saint Hill Manor, near East Grinstead. Science In the 14th century, Thomas Bradwardine's work crossed the boundaries of science, philosophy and religion. Bradwardine later became Archbishop of Canterbury. Pell's equation and the Pell number are both named after 17th century mathematician John Pell. Pell is sometimes credited with inventing the division sign, which has also been attributed to Swiss mathematician Johann Heinrich Rahn, one of his students. In the 19th century, geologist and palaeontologist Gideon Mantell began the scientific study of dinosaurs. In 1822 he was responsible for the discovery and eventual identification of the first fossil teeth, and later much of the skeleton of Iguanodon. Braxton Hicks contractions are named after John Braxton Hicks, the Sussex doctor who in 1872 first described the uterine contractions not resulting in childbirth. Frederick Soddy, winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Chemistry In the 20th century, Frederick Soddy won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on radioactive substances, and his investigations into the origin and nature of isotopes. Frederick Gowland Hopkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929 with Christiaan Eijkman, for discovering the growth-stimulating vitamins. Martin Ryle shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974 with Cornishman Antony Hewish, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research. While working at the University of Sussex, Harold Kroto won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Richard Smalley and Robert Curl from Rice University in the USA for the discovery of fullerenes. David Mumford is a mathematician known for distinguished work in algebraic geometry and for research into vision and pattern theory, including the Mumford-Shah Functional. He won the International Mathematical Union's Fields Medal in 1974 and in 2010 was awarded the United States National Medal of Science. In the social sciences, Sussex was home to economist John Maynard Keynes from 1925 to 1946. The founding father of Keynesian economics, he is widely considered to be one of the founders of modern macroeconomics and the most influential economist of the 20th century.Davis, William L, Bob Figgins, David Hedengren, and Daniel B. Klein. \\"Economic Professors' Favorite Economic Thinkers, Journals, and Blogs,\\" Econ Journal Watch 8(2): 126‚Äì146, May 2011. David Pilbeam won the 1986 International Prize from the Fyssen Foundation. In the early 20th century, Sussex was at the centre of one of what has been described as 'British archaeology's greatest hoax'. Bone fragments said to have been collected in 1912 were presented as the fossilised remains of a previously unknown early human, referred to as Piltdown Man. In 1953 the bone fragments were exposed as a forgery, consisting of the lower jawbone of an orangutan deliberately combined with the skull of a fully developed modern human. From 1967 to 1979, Sussex was home to the Isaac Newton Telescope at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Herstmonceux Castle. Sport Sussex has a centuries-long tradition of sport. Sussex has played a key role in the early development of both cricket and stoolball. Cricket is recognised as having been formed in the Weald and Sussex CCC is England's oldest county cricket club. Slindon Cricket Club dominated the sport for a while in the 18th century. The cricket ground at Arundel Castle traditionally plays host to a Duchess of Norfolk's XI which plays the national test sides touring England. The sport of stoolball is also associated with Sussex, which has a claim to be where the sport originated and certainly where its revival took place in the early 20th century. Sussex is represented in the Football League by Brighton & Hove Albion and Crawley Town. Brighton has been a League member since 1920, whereas Crawley was promoted to the League in 2011. Sussex has had its own football association, since 1882 and its own football league, which has since expanded into Surrey, since 1920. In horse racing, Sussex is home to Goodwood, Fontwell Park, Brighton and Plumpton. The All England Jumping Course show jumping facility at Hickstead is situated north of Brighton and Hove. Visual arts Painting by George Smith of a scene near Arundel (mid 18th century), Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Some of the earliest known art in Sussex is the carvings in the galleries of the Neolithic flint mines at Cissbury on the South Downs near Worthing. These appear to include the heads of two red deer, an ox and a fish and are significant as few pieces of representational art survive from the British Neolithic period. From the Roman period, the palace at Fishbourne has the largest in situ collection of mosaics in the UK, while the villa at Bignor contains some of the best preserved Roman mosaics in England. Dating from around the 12th century, the 'Lewes Group' of wall paintings can be found in several churches across the centre of Sussex, including at Clayton, Coombes, Hardham, Plumpton and now-lost paintings at Westmeston. Some of the paintings are celebrated for their age, extent and quality: Ian Nairn calls those at Hardham \\"the fame of Hardham\\", and descriptions such as \\"fine\\", \\"Hardham's particular glory\\" and \\"one of the most important sets in the country\\" have been applied. Of uncertain origin, the Long Man of Wilmington is Europe‚Äôs largest representation of the human form. In the late 18th century several men commissioned important works of the county which ensured that its landscapes and daily life were captured onto canvas. William Burrell of Knepp Castle commissioned Swiss-born watercolourist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm to tour Sussex, producing 900 watercolours of the county's buildings. Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, whose seat was at Goodwood House, commissioned landscape artist George Smith of Chichester to produce various works. George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont of Petworth House was a patron of painters such as JMW Turner and John Constable. John 'Mad Jack' Fuller also commissioned Turner to make a series of paintings which resulted in thirteen finished watercolours of Fuller's house at Brightling Park and the area around it. In the 19th century landscape watercolourist Copley Fielding lived in Sussex and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley and painter and sculptor Eric Gill were born in Brighton. Gill later founded an art colony in Ditchling known as The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, which survived until 1989. The 1920s and 1930s saw the creation of some of the best-known works by Edward Burra who was known for his work of Sussex, Paris and Harlem and Eric Ravilious who is known for his paintings of the South Downs and Eric Slater with his colour woodcuts of the Sussex landscape.Trollope, James (2013). \\"Slater's Sussex\\", Towner. . Also in the 1920s and 1930s, Surrealist painter Paul Nash lived at Iden and later in Rye and became friends with Burra. Edward Burra's anti-war Skull in a Landscape (1946), Imperial War Museum, London In the early 20th century Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, both members of the Bloomsbury Group, lived and worked at Charleston Farmhouse near Firle. Sussex also became a major centre for surrealism in the early 20th century. At West Dean, Edward James was patron to artists including Salvador Dal√≠ and Ren√© Magritte while at Farley Farm House near Chiddingly the home of Roland Penrose and Lee Miller was frequented by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Jean Dubuffet, Dorothea Tanning and Max Ernst. Both collections form one of the most important bodies of Surrealist art in Europe. =Sculpture= The Cass Sculpture Foundation is based at Goodwood. Chichester Cathedral has the early Chichester reliefs which affected the likes of the young Eric Gill growing up nearby and Henry Moore. Chichester Cathedral is also home to several contemporary works by John Skelton who lived and worked at Streat near Ditchling. Skelton was nephew of Eric Gill whose Ditchling community saw a number of important artists pass through. Worthing Museum and Art Gallery has works in the collection by Philip Jackson, Dora Gordine and John Skelton. Henri Gaudier-Brzeska's letters to Sophie BrzeskaSavage Messiah H.S Ede. documents their visit to Littlehampton in 1913 to recuperate, not having seen the sea for a year. Peter Randall-Page grew up in Crowborough spending his childhood exploring Ashdown Forest. Philip Jackson lives and works in West Sussex.
